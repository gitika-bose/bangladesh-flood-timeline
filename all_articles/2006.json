    "text": "Lured by the Beach Side of a Beleaguered Land in Bangladesh\n2006-12-24T05:00:00.000Z\nIT was a crisp and gorgeous day, and there were fewer than 100 people on Inani Beach, a wide swath of powdery white sand stretching from horizon to horizon along Bangladesh's southeastern tip. It is part of a sandy stretch that measures 75 miles tip to tip, and is often called the world's longest beach, but it felt more like the loneliest.\nI was lounging on a rented deck chair for several hours last April on sand as soft and flat as the Bay of Bengal itself, spread out like a freshly paved road. Rows of spindly firs swayed in the salty breeze. And the only interruptions were the young Bangladeshis who would fetch me a lukewarm cola for a small baksheesh, or tip.\nThere are no Jet Skis, no motorboats and no cars -- just the splashing of the bath-warm water. Pedal-powered rickshaws idled on the dirt road. Wooden fishing boats bobbed gently on the dark green water, like pirate ships of yore. It was so quiet, in fact, that wearing headphones would seem somehow rude, even if you were listening to George's Harrison's \"Bangladesh.\"\nFor a certain generation, that's how this country is best remembered: for the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh that Harrison and his friends, including the Bengali musician Ravi Shankar, held to raise money for famine relief in Bangladesh.\nBangladesh still rarely makes the news unless there's a devastating flood,a disease outbreak or political turmoil, as was the case last month when strikes related to next month's elections paralyzed the country and left at least two dead. (At travel.state.gov/travel, the State Department has cautioned Americans that it \"expects the situation throughout Bangladesh to remain uncertain through January.\")\nBut this impoverished, overpopulated and beleaguered country is quietly drawing tourists. While many if not most of Bangladesh's visitors come from India, more Westerners are discovering this undeveloped stretch along the eastern edge of the Bay of Bengal as a less traveled and cheaper alternative to Bali and Thailand.\nWedged into northeastern India and along a short border with Myanmar (formerly Burma), this fertile sea-level land straddles the Tropic of Cancer and is intercut by the Ganges, Jamuna and Meghna Rivers on their way to the Bay of Bengal. It has marshy jungles crisscrossed by innumerable streams, wide tracts of unspoiled beaches and the Sundarbans in the southwest, the largest mangrove forest in the world and home of the royal Bengal tiger.\nAnd much of it, refreshingly, is free of tourists. Indeed, the country's tourist board has adopted the slogan \"Visit Bangladesh Before Tourists Come.\"\nWith 147 million people occupying roughly the same area as Iowa, Bangladesh is among the most densely populated nations on earth. It's also a Muslim nation.. As such, every experience is informed by Islam, from the morning prayers broadcast from tall citadels to the near absence of liquor stores and anything resembling Western night life.\nI started my monthlong visit in Dhaka, the swirling and chaotic capital on the Buriganga River. One doesn't enjoy a casual stroll through Dhaka. A trip to the city's center means bushwhacking through throngs of garishly decorated rickshaws, buses held together by Bondo putty and taxis that belch and wheeze around the clock.\nDhaka is also not the most pleasant-smelling city; a hint of sewage and humanity always hangs in the hot and sticky air.\nI didn't stay long. Like most travelers, I made my way to Cox's Bazar, a bustling town on that same long stretch of beach as Inani. The trip from Dhaka was a harrowing 10 hours in a ramshackle former school bus. This was not a peaceful journey: Bangladeshi drivers are not known for staying in their lanes.\nBut just miles away from frenzied, industrialized Dhaka, the landscape changed dramatically and revealed a verdant, flat land covered by hand-tended rice fields and palm trees hanging lazily in the heat. Tiny ponds, green from algae, dotted the countryside like puddles after a rainstorm. Children bathed and played and waved excitedly at passing buses.\nCox's Bazar may be a beach town, but in some ways it feels like a big city. With narrow dirty roads that are jam-packed from sunrise to well-past sunset, it is a smaller version of Dhaka -- unnerving, unkempt and madcap. But it is also the epicenter of Bangladesh's tourism, and the favored staging ground for visitors heading out to the pristine white sand beaches and balmy, shark-free waters.\nThough the beach stretches for miles to the north and south, most visitors are content to sit on the sands at Cox's Bazar itself. They're free, open to the public and so expansive that it's nearly impossible to feel crowded.\nFor Westerners trying to blend in, hitting the beach Bangladeshi-style means leaving the bikini at home. Beachgoers dress is if they were going to work. Men are clad in slacks and dress shirts -- some even wear ties. Their wives, without exception, wear traditional saris. Even the children are dressed modestly in long pants and button-downs. And no one swims as much as they wade in the warm water, their pant legs and saris hiked up to their knees.\nYou won't come across many Westerners, but that may change. Beachfront plots are being snapped up by hoteliers hoping to develop the tropical sandbar into a tourist strip. Several high-end hotels catering to well-heeled foreigners have already opened.\nAmong the newest is the self-described \"four star\" Seagull Hotel, a short walk from the aptly named Hotel Road, a couple of miles south of the town's center. Soaring above the evergreens that line the beach, its mirrored glass and white-concrete facade stands in stark contrast to the town's modest and dusty red-brick shacks. It looks more like a suburban American office building than a beachfront resort.\nThe hotel has 182 Holiday Inn-style rooms, a restaurant that serves pizza, a beauty salon, a private walkway to the beach and a big swimming pool, where, on a Monday afternoon, a handful of European men were discussing business. But otherwise, the hotel felt empty.\nStill, at $60 a night for a double room with ocean views, there's no denying its appeal. Moreover, the service is prompt, professional and friendly.\nIn fact, everywhere you go in Cox's Bazar (or Bangladesh, for that matter) the people are friendly to a fault. Like gnats on a hot afternoon, clouds of children and grown men swarm around foreigners as they walk down the street, eat at a restaurant or sit down for a haircut. At first, this may come across as aggressive, but you soon realize it is their way of showing hospitality.\nI learned this firsthand on a day trip to Moheshkali, an island a few miles offshore from Cox's Bazar where Burmese refugees live in peaceful accord with Bangladeshis and a Hindu minority, giving this tiny fishing island an unusual air of multiculturalism.\nSince this was at the tail end of the dry season, the weather was prone to sudden downpours. So while the sky was clear and the waters smooth when I boarded the ferry that morning, menacing thunderclouds and violent lighting awaited my return a few hours later.\nAs the ferry -- actually, a 10-person powerboat -- rocked and rolled across the bay, tossed like an injured duckling in the chop, a young man leaned in and yelled in English: \"Hey, American! Are you scared?\"\nTruth be told, I wasn't. Since arriving in Bangladesh, I'd survived a 10-hour game of chicken in a hand-me-down bus, ridden shotgun in rickety rickshaws that tipped over regularly, and pushed through narrow alleys packed three-deep with nervous cows. What's a little seasickness?\nBut this man wasn't antagonizing me; he was striking up a conversation. Back on terra firma, the young man, Muhammad, a high school teacher, invited me to a nearby cafe, where we dried off and enjoyed sweet tea and even sweeter pastries.\nTo repay his kindness, I visited his class the next morning, where I gave an impromptu English lesson. Once again, I was invited to tea, this time by a doe-eyed student eager to learn more about America. I graciously declined; this back-and-forth generosity could have gone on for days -- and I wanted to get back to the beach.\nA CROWDED LAND, EXCEPT AT THE SHORE\nGETTING THERE\nSeveral airlines fly to Dhaka from New York City with one stop, among them Emirates, British Airways and Cathay Pacific. A recent Web search for late January found round-trip fares starting around $1,335, on Emirates.\nFrom Los Angeles, Malaysia Airlines was as low as $1,201 for a round trip, but with stops in Taiwan and Kuala Lumpur. Thai, Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines made one-stop flights for several hundred dollars more.\nTraveling within Bangladesh is inexpensive. A driver can be hired for 1,500 taka (about $21 at 73 taka to the dollar) a day. The 10-hour bus trip from Dhaka to Cox's Bazar was 700 taka each way.\nUnited States citizens must present a valid visa upon arrival, which costs $100 and is valid for 90 days from date of entry. But visa requirements can change, so consult the Bangladesh Embassy in Washington (202-244-0183, www.bangladoot.org).\nThose who enter Bangladesh by air but plan to leave by land will need a Change of Route permit, issued free by the Immigration and Passport Office (Agargaon Road, Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, Dhaka; 840-2-913-4011). It typically takes two business days.\nThe Bangladeshi weekend is Friday and Saturday, and banks and many stores are closed. A.T.M.s outside Dhaka are not connected to the international network, and traveler's checks are very difficult to cash. Bring new, crisp American dollars -- due to counterfeiting, many stores accept only \"beautiful\" bills.\nJanuary and February are the best times to visit, when temperatures average 78 degrees and the humidity is low.\nWHERE TO STAY\nThe Seagull Hotel in Cox's Bazaar (Motel Road; 880-341-62480 or 880-2-832-2973 for Dhaka office; www.seagullhotelbd.com) is among the new upscale resorts catering to Westerners. Deluxe double rooms start at 3,600 taka, including tax, but packages can be even cheaper.\nThough somewhat fallen from its glory days, Hotel Shaibal (Motel Road; 880-341-63274; e-mail, bpcho@bangla.net) has a private beach and one of the town's few legal bars. Air-conditioned rooms start at 2,000 taka in the high season.\nWhen passing through Dhaka, seek out the greener streets and clean sheets at the Jame Prestige Abode (House 97, Road 4, Block B; 880-2-882-9474; e-mail, jame@bijoy.net). This guesthouse has attentive service, air-conditioning, satellite TV and a small refrigerator for $26.\nWHERE TO EAT\nBangladesh cuisine is not unlike Indian food -- curries, spicy stews, nan-like breads -- though with less variation. Bangladeshis eat with their hands, and utensils are not available at most restaurants.\nFor authentic, inexpensive meals in Cox's Bazar, try the misnamed Pizza Palace often in English and Bengali) at the corner of Motel and Sea Beach Roads: there's no pizza on the menu, but the curries are delicious.\nFor sunset dining, take a 140-taka rickshaw ride out of town to Angel Drop Restaurant (Marine Drive Road, Kalatali New Sea Beach; 880-171-441-416). The snacks are fine, but the scenery is spectacular.\nSpeedboat ferries to Moheshkali leave all day for about 100 taka; they depart when the boat is full. Ask a rickshaw driver to take you to \"the dock,\" or just say \"Moheshkali.\" JEFF KOYEN",

    "text": "Man Who Knows His Cows Also Knows His Cheese\n2006-04-19T05:00:00.000Z\nIN a city of Mexican sushi chefs and Thai bagel makers, it may not seem surprising that the cheese maven at a specialty food store is from Bangladesh, a nation not noted for its cheese.\nBut the love of cheese that Zahidul Hakim brings to his job as head cheesemonger at Balducci's new store at Eighth Avenue and 14th Street was not just an acquired taste. Cheese starts with the animals, and with the animals is how Mr. Hakim grew up, on a farm in the village of Vhawel, across the river from Bangladesh's capital city, Dhaka.\nHe, his parents and his six brothers and sisters lived with no electricity or running water, eating only what they grew or raised. Mr. Hakim's father died when he was small, and all of the children worked the fields before and after school. They grew rice, chili peppers, pink-brown shallots, potatoes, tomatoes and more than 25 types of mango trees. They raised catfish, butterfish and buffalo fish in their pond; fed the chickens scratching in the yard; and milked water buffalo, goats, sheep and a cow.\n\"My mother made rich yogurts and tangy cheese\" called ponir, Mr. Hakim said. The cheese was a two-and-a-half-pound tomme-like round, white, crumbly and salty, a bit like feta. It was mainly a way to preserve milk in a hot climate, but it was still a treat.\n\"We eat ponir on its own,\" he said, \"savoring it as a separate course, much like the French do. We consider it a great delicacy, and believe it is good for the immune system.\"\nMr. Hakim thought he had left cheese behind when he came to America 13 years ago to study at La Guardia Community College. He later got a business degree at Pace University. But when he ran low on cash, he took a job at a Greek-owned gourmet shop, Nature's Gifts, on 86th Street between First and Second Avenues.\n\"One day,\" he said, \"the wonderful Greek lady behind the cheese counter told me, 'Hakim, I'm going to teach you about cheese, a new one every day!' This is how I fell in love with cheese.\"\nThe first one he tasted was a German cow's milk blue cheese, cambozola. \"The blue color frightened me, because where I grew up, blue was a sign that the cheese had spoiled,\" he said. \"I tentatively put a morsel in my mouth and was slightly shocked by its soft texure; then the flavor kicked in and it was really good.\"\nAfter hundreds of days with hundreds of new cheeses, Mr. Hakim had become knowledgeable enough to be hired by Dean & Deluca in August 1997. He eventually became the manager of the cheese department, before moving to Balducci's in December.\nBut it is Mr. Hakim's background, more than his training, that gives him such a keen appreciation of cheese. In Bangladesh it is even more seasonal than it is elsewhere because of the dramatic weather. During the monsoon season, when the fields flooded and there was no grass, Mr. Hakim and his family harvested water lilies from their pond to feed to the animals.\n\"When the animals eat grass,\" Mr. Hakim said, \"their milk is so rich that when we warm it on the stove, the whole neighborhood can smell its buttery goodness.\"\nWhen fed on water lilies, the animals produced milk that was greenish and watery; the cheese and yogurt his mother made was lighter.\nMr. Hakim said his mother, Tahera Khatum, had a personal connection to their cheeses and told him, \"I can see and smell what the animals are eating, how they are feeling, how the season and the weather are treating them.\"\nShe would test the milk's consistency by dipping a finger into it and seeing how much clung to her skin, he said. That would show her what kind of cheese or yogurt to make.\n\"She can even tell the color of the cow by the quality of the milk,\" he said. \"Red-skinned cows make the tastiest milk, in her opinion.\"\nWhen Mr. Hakim returned to Bangladesh in 2003 for his second visit home, he took Abbaye de Belloc, a washed-rind sheep's milk cheese from the French Pyrenees. When his mother visited New York recently, she got a wider selection.\n\"How can cheese become like this?\" he said she marveled as she nibbled through a variety of tastes and textures.\nHe said he can relate to her sense of delight. \"A wonderful cheese always brings a smile to my face,\" he said. \"Cheese is a precious substance which the farmer has worked hard to create,\" he said. \"I like to treat it with the respect it deserves.\"",

    "text": "Misery Chic\n2006-12-10T05:00:00.000Z\n Since Africa\u2019s colonial era ended in the 1960s, the West has sunk, by some estimates, more than $500 billion into aid to develop the world\u2019s most impoverished continent, the equivalent of several Marshall Plans. And yet by most indicators, the continent has stagnated or declined. Might Hollywood succeed where Washington failed? This year, George Clooney campaigned to end the killings in Darfur, Madonna helped finance orphanages in Malawi, Bono rallied against debt and AIDS and a passel of lesser celebrities donned khaki and hit the refugee camps, camera crews in tow. In the background, just out of the frame of paparazzi snapshots, you could often find the Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs, who has undertaken worthy village-level initiatives to improve African agriculture and education. When Angelina Jolie went to Kenya to film an MTV special last year, the professor rode shotgun. When Madonna adopted a child from a Malawian orphanage, Sachs\u2019s wife, a pediatrician, was there to offer medical advice.\nThe rallying point this time, unlike those in previous cases of celebrity activism, is not a crisis \u2014 starvation in Ethiopia, a flood in Bangladesh \u2014 but rather an infinitely complex continent. Indeed, the word \u201cAfrica\u201d has become a brand, synonymous with misery and moral obligation. When Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s face appeared in an advertisement above the boldface declaration \u201cI Am African,\u201d you didn\u2019t need to read the small print to realize she was talking about the AIDS epidemic. The Gap\u2019s ad campaign, which featured the likes of Steven Spielberg and Chris Rock in bright red clothing meant to promote a similar cause, packaged African charity as a $28 T-shirt.\nSome Africans have mixed feelings about their newfound trendiness. Recent tabloid imbroglios \u2014 Sierra Leonean amputees who appear in the film \u201cBlood Diamond\u201d have reportedly claimed that the studio didn\u2019t give them promised prosthetics; Madonna\u2019s adorable orphan turns out to have a living father \u2014 risk sending the message that Africa\u2019s famous friends are motivated less by what they can give than by what they can take away. \u201cI think if everybody went there, they\u2019d want to bring one of those children home with them and give them a better life,\u201d Madonna told Oprah Winfrey. But Africans believe in a better Africa: the same surveys that suggest they are feeling poorer also show they\u2019re hopeful for a prosperous future. ",

In the background, just out of the frame of paparazzi snapshots, you could often find the Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs, who has undertaken worthy village-level initiatives to improve African agriculture and education. When Angelina Jolie went to Kenya to film an MTV special last year, the professor rode shotgun. When Madonna adopted a child from a Malawian orphanage, Sachs's wife, a pediatrician, was there to offer medical advice.\nThe rallying point this time, unlike those in previous cases of celebrity activism, is not a crisis -- starvation in Ethiopia, a flood in Bangladesh -- but rather an infinitely complex continent. Indeed, the word \"Africa\" has become a brand, synonymous with misery and moral obligation. When Gwyneth Paltrow's face appeared in an advertisement above the boldface declaration \"I Am African,\" you didn't need to read the small print to realize she was talking about the AIDS epidemic. The Gap's ad campaign, which featured the likes of Steven Spielberg and Chris Rock in bright red clothing meant to promote a similar cause, packaged African charity as a $28 T-shirt.\nSome Africans have mixed feelings about their newfound trendiness. Recent tabloid imbroglios -- Sierra Leonean amputees who appear in the film \"Blood Diamond\" have reportedly claimed that the studio didn't give them promised prosthetics; Madonna's adorable orphan turns out to have a living father -- risk sending the message that Africa's famous friends are motivated less by what they can give than by what they can take away. \"I think if everybody went there, they'd want to bring one of those children home with them and give them a better life,\" Madonna told Oprah Winfrey. But Africans believe in a better Africa: the same surveys that suggest they are feeling poorer also show they're hopeful for a prosperous future.\nANDREW RICE",

    "text": "Letter from America: Turning out gadgets for a $2-a-day multitude\n2006-01-01T05:00:00.000Z\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 David Hume wrote in 1742 that \"legislators and founders of states\" had to be ranked as superior to inventors in terms of their benefit to humanity; the inventor's work might \"increase the commodities and enjoyments of life,\" but without sound government this would mean little.\nHume might have wished to reconsider had he lived to see some modern-day legislatures - or certain of today's inventors, particularly those who apply brilliant pragmatism to improving the lot of the world's poorest.\nFor the more than two billion people who subsist on less than $2 a day, the inventions churned out from First World design labs - the iPod, the PalmPilot, even the personal computer - are, for all their genius, almost unimaginably irrelevant.\n\"Ninety percent of the people who design things are addressing the problems of the richest 5 percent of people in the world,\" said Paul Polak. His International Development Enterprises - a nonprofit entity with U.S., Canadian and European funding - combines bootstrap technologies and the powers of markets to help the poorest, particularly subsistence farmers.\n\"You have to stand the Western design process on its ear,\" he said, to engage in \"a ruthless pursuit of affordability.\" And so it is coming to pass.\nFrom California college students to farsighted Indian farmers, innovators are working to provide clean and affordable water supplies and cheap irrigation pumps, to solve basic health problems, to ease transportation and improve power supplies and communications. More than simply inventing, they help establish local manufactories and marketing networks.\nOften they collaborate with micro-credit providers, like the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, to help ensure the affordability of their inventions. Charity is not part of the formula.\nThey labor tirelessly against what Bill Gates calls \"stupid poverty,\" problems that can be solved cheaply with ordinary resources and a bit of creativity.\n\"When you only have $1 a day,\" said Polak, \"affordability becomes the most critical variable.\"\nConsider: In 1965, an Israeli firm, looking for ways to irrigate arid lands with scant water, invented drip irrigation. Rather than the wasteful flooding of ditches or fields, water is pumped through tubes to drip out through holes only where needed.\nA brilliantly simple notion, it was unaffordable at first to the poorest - the three-quarters of the world's farmers who work less than two hectares, or five acres.\nBut, in a pattern to be repeated, innovative minds found ways. Forget the pump; use gravity. Tubes could be hooked to a metal barrel of water placed atop a table. Even a plastic bag of water on a pole would serve.\nConventional pumps can be expensive. Enter the treadle pump, powered by a person stepping back and forth on two pedals. The pump is sold for $8; drilling, pipes and tubes add $16. The device can triple the income of a $300-a-year farmer.\n\"It is huge,\" said Polak. \"If you add $500 in net income to somebody who makes $300, in Bangladesh or rural India, they've moved into the middle class.\"\nContaminated drinking water is a widespread source of disease. Meet the LifeStraw, a sort of u\u0308ber-straw packed with seven filters to allow water to be safely sipped from ponds, wells or rivers. Good for perhaps a year, it costs $7. Time magazine rated it one of the year's best inventions.\nPolak's group helped fund development of a clay-and-sawdust water filter in Cambodia; for Nepal a smaller version was designed, for lugging to mountain villages.\nIndian inventors have been prolific - people like Harish Hande, whose Selco produces a solar-powered home lighting system. These, the company says, benefit people like Kumarasiri, a skilled carpenter who can now keep his home workshop open after dark.\nPhil Weilerstein, director of the National Collegiate Inventors & Innovators Alliance, said that a rising number of U.S. universities - some 200 - offer programs in developing affordable technologies. Students, whether from altruism or a desire to gain global experience and hone problem-solving skills, have producedmarketable inventions, as have some professors.\nWeilerstein points to the Xtracycle, a sort of bicycle-extender able to carry 100 kilograms, or 220 pounds, of cargo, designed and marketed by Stanford students.\n 1 \n2\nNext Page \u00bb\n",

    "text": "Toll rises to 54 in Bangladesh textile fire\n2006-02-24T05:00:00.000Z\n\nCHITTAGONG, Bangladesh \u2014 Rescuers recovered 48 more bodies from the charred debris of a textile mill in southeastern Bangladesh Friday, raising the death toll from the devastating fire to 54, officials said.\nThe fire that broke out late Thursday at the Bangladeshi-owned KTS Textile Mill near the port city of Chittagong also injured more than 150 workers, 82 of whom were hospitalized, doctors at Chittagong Medical College Hospital said.\nAbout 1,000 workers, many of them women, were inside when the fire broke out, said Abu Tayeb, an official of a textile manufacturers' and exporters' association. Most managed to leave the building on their own, he said.\nPolice officer Anwarul Azim said rescuers, including villagers and soldiers, were sifting through the rubble searching for survivors or bodies among the debris of the three-story building at an industrial park near Chittagong, about 215 kilometers (135 miles) southeast of the capital, Dhaka.\nMost of the victims were women who burned to death or suffocated from smoke inhalation, a doctor at the medical college said on condition of anonymity as he is not authorized to talk to the media. Six badly burnt bodies were found overnight Thursday.\nThe factory had only one main exit, and workers had to scramble through a lone narrow stairway to escape, while others jumped from windows, said fire official Rashidul Islam, quoting survivors.\nFirefighters took about three hours to control Thursday's blaze, which was exacerbated when an electric generator and boiler exploded, fire officials said.\nSmall fires continued to erupt sporadically, because of cloth and chemical dyes stored in the basement and wood-and-bamboo scaffolding on the under-construction fourth floor, Islam said.\nAuthorities have formed a three-member committee to investigate the fire, he added.\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Khaleda Zia was scheduled to visit victims of the fire in Chittagong later Friday, her office said in Dhaka.\nThe factory, built two years ago, makes readymade garments and textiles for export, mainly to the United States, Tayeb said.\nThe fire may have been triggered by sparks from an electric tool, a fire investigator said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media.\nPolice cordoned off the factory to prevent relatives and looters from rushing in, and local authorities ordered other nearby factories to stay shut.\nTextiles are Bangladesh's main export earner, worth US$5 billion (\u20ac4.2 billion) a year. The industry employs about 2 million workers, mostly women, and exports mainly to Europe and North America.\nMany of the country's estimated 2,500 textile factories are built in violation of building codes or safety standards, and labor unions claim many lack emergency exits, fire extinguishers or alarms and first-aid equipment.\nAt least 95 workers were killed and scores more injured in two separate accidents in garment factories last year.\n",

    "text": "Nobel Comes Just in Time for Troubled Bangladesh\n2006-10-20T04:00:00.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh, Oct. 19 \u2014 The timing, Bangladeshis confess, could not have been better. \nWith a troubled election season around the corner, the Nobel Peace Prize comes to Bangladesh as it braces for battle with itself. Or as Muhammad Habibur Rahman, a retired chief justice, put it, \u201cThe country is in such doldrums, it\u2019s a shot in the arm.\u201d \nThis densely populated, grindingly poor country of 147 million people is frequently troubled by doldrums, natural and political. The latest is an impasse between the main political parties over who will take over at the end of next week, when the current Bangladesh National Party-led administration is to hand power to a caretaker government. \nSo bitter are the politics here that the law requires a caretaker to organize elections. The high-stakes haggling over who that should be this year has added to the usual level of distrust in a country where the widespread perception of corruption and the rivalry between the ruling party and the opposition have induced a long bout of political paralysis. \nThe opposition has threatened to boycott the elections, scheduled for early 2007. Its loyalists have clashed repeatedly with the police. Talks to resolve the standoff have proved futile.\nBut now there is the \u201cYunus effect,\u201d as some call it, named for Muhammad Yunus, the microcredit pioneer of Bangladesh and the winner of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize. \nMr. Yunus has inspired jubilation amid the gloom. Shegufta Yasmeen, who waited to greet him one morning this week holding white gladioli, said he was \u201clike the light of the moon in a dark room.\u201d\nMr. Yunus, for his part, has used his Nobel bully pulpit to gently goad his country\u2019s leaders to behave better. Engage in a marathon negotiating session, he has urged; work out a deal; exploit the euphoria his award has created. His name has even been floated as a substitute caretaker. He has expressed no enthusiasm for the job.\nSince the announcement last Friday of the Nobel, which Mr. Yunus shares with his Grameen Bank, songs have been written in his honor. Banners and posters have gone up all over Dhaka, the capital. So many bouquets and wreaths have been dispatched to Grameen headquarters that it is a wonder there are any flowers left in Bangladesh. \nAgain and again, people here describe the Nobel as a prize second only to the country\u2019s freedom from Pakistan in 1971. \nTo recognize Grameen, of course, is to recognize how such nongovernmental organizations \u2014 Bangladesh seems to have more than its share \u2014 have stepped in to do a great many things that would normally be expected from government: building schools, offering health care and creating economic opportunities for the poorest in a country that is among the poorest in the world. \nInstead, political deadlock has carried the day, pitting the country\u2019s two most powerful women against each other, and the legacies of their respective families.\n Prime Minister Khaleda Zia rose to power after the assassination of her husband, Gen. Ziaur Rahman, the country\u2019s military ruler, in 1981. The opposition leader, Sheik Hasina Wazed, is the daughter of the founding prime minister, Sheik Mujibur Rahman. \nPolitics is a winner-take-all game in this country, and the stakes between them are high. \nMr. Yunus has called Bangladeshi politics \u201ca bottleneck\u201d to the country\u2019s aspirations.

They have to fight because they came into politics because of their legacy. There\u2019s no substance in the politics.\u201d\nThe two leaders are out of the country. \n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just sit down and settle the whole thing?\u201d Mr. Yunus wondered aloud. \u201cIf they don\u2019t agree the situation is going to be very explosive. There will be political chaos.\u201d \nHe could hardly hide his distaste. \u201cBut they go their merry way.\u201d \nA solution was possible, he insisted, indeed unavoidable. \u201cAfter this euphoria, I don\u2019t think leaders have a chance to go to agitation,\u201d he said. \nA former classmate and a retired police inspector, M.

    "text": "Nobel comes just in time for troubled Bangladesh - Asia - Pacific - International Herald Tribune\n2006-10-20T05:00:00.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 The timing, Bangladeshis confess, could not have been better.\nWith a troubled election season around the corner, the Nobel Peace Prize comes to Bangladesh as it braces for battle with itself. Or as Muhammad Habibur Rahman, a retired chief justice, put it, \"The country is in such doldrums, it's a shot in the arm.\"\nThis densely populated, grindingly poor country of 147 million people is frequently troubled by doldrums, natural and political. The latest is an impasse between the main political parties over who will take over at the end of next week, when the current Bangladesh National Party-led administration is to hand power to a caretaker government.\nSo bitter are the politics here that the law requires a caretaker to organize elections. The high-stakes haggling over who that should be this year has added to the usual level of distrust in a country where the widespread perception of corruption and the rivalry between the ruling party and the opposition have induced a long bout of political paralysis.\nThe opposition has threatened to boycott the elections, scheduled for early 2007. Its loyalists have clashed repeatedly with the police. Talks to resolve the standoff have proved futile.\nBut now there is the \"Yunus effect,\" as some call it, named for Muhammad Yunus, the microcredit pioneer of Bangladesh and the winner of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize.\nYunus has inspired jubilation amid the gloom. Shegufta Yasmeen, who waited to greet him one morning this week holding white gladioli, said he was \"like the light of the moon in a dark room.\"\nYunus, for his part, has used his Nobel bully pulpit to gently goad his country's leaders to behave better. Engage in a marathon negotiating session, he has urged; work out a deal; exploit the euphoria his award has created. His name has even been floated as a substitute caretaker. He has expressed no enthusiasm for the job.\nSince the announcement last Friday of the Nobel, which Yunus shares with his Grameen Bank, songs have been written in his honor. Banners and posters have gone up all over Dhaka, the capital. So many bouquets and wreaths have been dispatched to Grameen headquarters that it is a wonder there are any flowers left in Bangladesh.\nAgain and again, people here describe the Nobel as a prize second only to the country's freedom from Pakistan in 1971.\nTo recognize Grameen, of course, is to recognize how such nongovernmental organizations - Bangladesh seems to have more than its share - have stepped in to do a great many things that would normally be expected from government: building schools, offering health care and creating economic opportunities for the poorest in a country that is among the poorest in the world.\nInstead, political deadlock has carried the day, pitting the country's two most powerful women against each other, and the legacies of their respective families.\nPrime Minister Khaleda Zia rose to power after the assassination of her husband, Gen. Ziaur Rahman, the country's military ruler, in 1981. The opposition leader, Sheik Hasina Wazed, is the daughter of the founding prime minister, Sheik Mujibur Rahman.\nPolitics is a winner-take-all game in this country, and the stakes between them are high.\nYunus has called Bangladeshi politics \"a bottleneck\" to the country's aspirations. Transparency International's 2005 annual Perceived Corruption Index, based on surveys of businesspeople and analysts, listed Bangladesh at the bottom, with Chad.\n\"There's no ideological fight between them,\" Yunus said of the leaders in an interview here this week. \"They go back to what your husband did, what your father did. They have to fight because they came into politics because of their legacy. There's no substance in the politics.\"\nThe two leaders are out of the country.\n\"Why don't you just sit down and settle the whole thing?\" Yunus wondered aloud. \"If they don't agree the situation is going to be very explosive. There will be political chaos.\"\nHe could hardly hide his distaste. \"But they go their merry way.\"\nA solution was possible, he insisted, indeed unavoidable. \"After this euphoria, I don't think leaders have a chance to go to agitation,\" he said.\nA former classmate and a retired police inspector, M. Aziz Ul Huq, said that Yunus was always an optimist. \"A very rare quality, particularly in our country,\" he said.\nEven more of a goad, Yunus has lately hinted at the prospect of starting a party. This year, he joined a citizens' group that toured the country calling for honest and competent candidates. It did not win him many friends from either of the main parties.\nEven by the standards of Bangladesh, the elections are shaping up to be particularly troubling. In private, Bangladeshis say they worry not about whether blood will be spilled before the voting, but how much. Several hundred people were killed just before and after the last general elections, in 2001, and they were not laden with nearly as much controversy as these elections.\nThis time, the opposition Awami League has threatened to boycott, over the issue of the chosen caretaker and the composition of the election commission, both of whom it accuses of being partisan. The opposition leader, Sheik Hasina, has exhorted her followers to pour into the streets. The ruling party has blamed the Awami League for thwarting democracy.\nThe voter roll is also embroiled in controversy. It contains many more names than in the 2001 elections and represents roughly two-thirds of the total population - which a pre-election team dispatched by the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, a nonprofit group, in September said \"strains credibility.\"\nA worry that Bangladeshis largely banished many years ago has recently resurfaced: Will the military step in if there is chaos?\nBangladeshis have been ground down by much more than election uncertainty. In September violent demonstrations over crippling power failures spilled into the streets of this capital. Garment workers went on strike demanding higher wages. Earlier, journalists and political party workers were attacked, some fatally.\nIn spring 2004, even the British high commissioner to Bangladesh, Anwar Choudhury, was injured in a grenade attack on the outskirts of Dhaka. Members of an outlawed Islamist group confessed to the attack last month. Bangladesh was struck by its first (and only) suicide bombing in December 2005. Earlier last year, militants set off more than 400 homemade bombs across the country.\nThe troubles eased, when the government arrested several members of a banned Islamist group, Jamaat-ul-Mujahedeen Bangladesh; five have been sentenced to death.\nSo while gushing comes easily to Bangladeshis, the rejoicing these days is all the more striking for the disquiet that they say they have lived with for many months - and may well have to live with for a while longer.\n\"We are a nation thirsty for recognition for something good,\" Mahfuz Anam, the editor of The Daily Star, an English-language newspaper, said, explaining the excitement of the last few days. \"The euphoria is absolutely proportionate to the despondency that was there.\"",

    "text": "For a U.K. bank, Asia pays off - Business - International Herald Tribune\n2006-10-06T05:00:00.000Z\nLONDON \u2014 The latest deal by Standard Chartered, the British bank with a big Asian presence, may seem odd. It is paying a premium of more than 30 percent for Hsinchu of Taiwan, a bank saddled with bad credit card loans that has shown a loss so far this year.\nBut Standard Chartered has rarely followed a predictable course. And for years, it has defied critics' warnings that it was overpaying for deals, as well as market predictions that it would be gobbled up by a big global bank.\nWith most of its operations in fast- growing economies from Pakistan to Singapore to the United Arab Emirates, and its largest concentration of customers and profit in Hong Kong, Standard Chartered is in a position that makes it the envy of many of its investment and commercial banking peers in Europe and the United States.\nStandard Chartered is in a prime spot to capitalize on some of the biggest trends in global finance, like the growing trade between China and Africa and between the Middle East and Asia and the boom in consumer lending in India. It gets 90 percent of its profit from Asia, the Middle East and Africa.\nIts chief executive, Mervyn Davies, a 53-year-old Welshman, acknowledges that Standard Chartered's astute growth in emerging markets may only make it more appealing for a bigger bank predator. But he certainly isn't encouraging any offers.\n\"Look, we are in the right place at the right time, and a lot of banks would like to have this franchise,\" Davies said in a recent interview in his art-laden London office. \"If they can manage it better, and can pay a huge premium to shareholders, in cash, well, that's my job - my job is to create value.\"\nWith a market capitalization of $34 billion, Standard Chartered would be just a healthy snack for, say, Bank of America at nearly $250 billion. But Standard Chartered's success may also be what helps it remain alone - its shares trade at a price/earnings ratio of 16.5, compared with 12.8 for HSBC Holdings, its British rival in Asian markets.\nStandard Charter's operating profit was up 15 percent in the first half of 2006 to $3.38 billion, even without the $3.3 billion acquisition last year of Korea First Bank. Most analysts are now giving Davies the thumbs up.\nCredit Suisse said in a recent note, \"We are becoming increasingly confident of the prospect for accelerated growth in Standard Chartered's consumer businesses and its ability to absorb regional shocks.\"\nMaybe that is because the bank has been through plenty. First there was the outbreak of sudden acute respiratory syndrome or SARS in 2003, Davies said, that \"stopped all travel in 14 countries.\" Then the tsunami of late 2004 in Thailand and elsewhere, the Pakistan earthquake, \"floods the like of which the planet has never seen\" in areas like Bangladesh and the impact of HIV and AIDS \"in a very big way\" on the bank's African business. Its next difficulties may well come from competition.\n\"There is a war for talent in banking,\" Davies said. Even if bigger global banks come knocking, Standard Chartered has the edge in some of these countries, he said, because of both its long history and very active social programs. The bank plans to restore sight to a million people by 2007 through a campaign that pays for eye doctors and cataract operations in 20 countries, for example.\n\"Local talent wants to work for someone that puts something back into the community,\" he said.",

    "text": "Shortage of cheap labor in China\n2006-04-02T05:00:00.000Z\n\nSHENZHEN, China \u2014 Hundreds of factories in China's fastest-growing areas are struggling to find enough workers, a change that could shake up the global market for manufactured goods.\nThe shortage is pushing up wages and swelling the ranks of the middle class, and it could make Chinese-made products less of a bargain worldwide.\nAt the Well Brain factory here in one of China's special economic zones, the challenges are clear. Over the past year, Well Brain, a midsize producer of small electric appliances like hair rollers and coffee makers, has raised salaries, improved benefits and even dispatched a team of recruiters to find workers in the countryside.\nThat kind of behavior was unheard- of as recently as three years ago, when millions of young people were still flooding into booming Shenzhen searching for any type of work.\nA few years ago, \"people would just show up at the door,\" said Liang Jian, the human resources manager at Well Brain. \"Now, we put up an ad looking for five people and maybe one person shows up.\"\nFor all the complaints of factory owners, though, the situation has a silver lining that may benefit both China and the rest of the world. Economists say the shortages are spurring companies to improve labor conditions here and to recruit workers more aggressively with perquisites and benefits.\nThe changes also suggest that China may already be moving up the economic ladder, as workers here see opportunities beyond simply being unskilled assemblers of the world's goods. \"The next great story in China is how they are going to move out of the lower-end stuff: the toys, textiles and sporting goods equipment,\" said Jonathan Anderson, an economist at UBS in Hong Kong. \"They're going to do different things.\"\nWhen sporadic labor shortages first appeared in late 2004, government leaders dismissed them as short-lived anomalies. But they now say the problem is likely to be a more persistent one. Experts say the shortages are arising primarily because China's economy is sizzling hot, farming has become more lucrative and factories are continuing to expand even as the number of young Chinese starts to level off. Prosperity is also moving inland, and workers who might earlier have migrated elsewhere are staying closer to home.\nThough estimates are hard to come by, data from officials suggest that major export industries are looking for at least one million additional workers, and the real number could be much higher.\n\"I think we've passed an inflection point,\" said Hong Liang, a Goldman Sachs economist who has studied labor costs in China. \"We're seeing an end to the golden period of extremely low-cost labor in China. There are plenty of workers, but the supply of uneducated workers is shrinking.\"\nBecause of these shortages, wage levels throughout China's manufacturing ranks are rising, threatening at some point to weaken China's competitiveness on world markets and prod many factories to relocate to other parts of Asia.\nLi & Fung, one of the world's biggest trading companies, said recently that labor shortages and rising manufacturing costs in China were already forcing it to step up its diversification efforts and locate supplies from factories in other parts of Asia.\n\"I look at China a lot differently than I did three years ago,\" said Bruce Rockowitz, president of Li & Fung in Hong Kong, citing the rising costs of doing business in China. \"China is no longer the lowest-cost producer. There's an evolution going on. People are now going to Vietnam, and India and Bangladesh.\"\nTo be sure, China is not be about to lose its title as factory floor of the world. And some analysts dispute the significance of the shortages. \"Reports of a shortage of unskilled and semi-skilled factory workers are overblown,\" said Andy Rothman, an analyst at CLSA. \"Companies are, however, having trouble finding experienced people to fill midlevel and senior management jobs.\"\nReports of labor shortages first emerged here in late 2004, when the government identified shortages in two critical provinces in southeastern China, Guangdong and Fujian. Some economists dismissed the reports, saying the labor shortages were temporary and most likely caused by immature and inefficient job markets.\n 1 \n2\nNext Page \u00bb\n",

Says\n2006-11-09T05:00:00.000Z\nThe toilet and the latrine, which more than a century ago helped revolutionize public health in Western cities like New York, London and Paris, are among the most underused tools to combat poverty and disease in the developing world, according to a United Nations report released today.\n\u201cIssues dealing with human excrement tend not to figure prominently in the programs of political parties contesting elections, or the agendas of governments,\u201d said Kevin Watkins, the report\u2019s main author. \u201cThey\u2019re the unwanted guests at the table.\u201d\nThe human cost of that taboo, however, is more unspeakable than the topic itself, he said. Every year, more than 2 million children die of diarrhea and other sicknesses caused by dirty water and a lack of \u201caccess to sanitation.\u201d \nThat\u2019s the common euphemism for the nose-wrinkling, retch-inducing reality that more than 2.6 billion people \u2014 one-third of the world\u2019s population \u2014 have no decent place to go to the bathroom, while more than 1 billion get water for drinking, washing and cooking from sources that are polluted by human and animal feces. \nAt any given time, almost half the population of developing countries have one or more of the main illnesses associated with inadequate water and sanitation \u2014 diarrhea, cholera, typhoid, trachoma and parasitic worms. Sufferers fill half the hospital beds in those countries, the report said. \nThe United Nations Development Program\u2019s annual attempt to measure human well-being, this year entitled, \u201cBeyond Poverty: Power, Poverty and the Global Water Crisis,\u201d lays out the grim, stinky facts.\nIn Kibera, the sprawling slum in Nairobi, Kenya, people defecate in plastic bags that they dump in ditches or toss into the street \u2014 a practice known as \u201cthe flying toilet.\u201d In Dharavi, the vast slum in Mumbai, India, there is only 1 toilet for each 1,440 people \u2014 and during the monsoon rains, flooded lanes run with human excrement.\nAcross the countryside of Asia and Africa, people squat in streams, back yards and fields, befouling the water they drink, the places their children play and the plots where their food grows. \nThe report\u2019s authors estimate that by investing $10 billion a year \u2014 less than half the amount consumers in wealthy countries spend on bottled water \u2014 the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water and simple pit latrines could be cut in half by 2015. The report criticizes the governments of poor and rich countries alike for paying too little attention to this fundamental problem. \n\u201cLife-saving investments in water and sanitation are dwarfed by military spending,\u201d the report says. \u201cIn Ethiopia, the military budget is ten times the water and sanitation budget \u2014 in Pakistan, 47 times.\u201d\n And aid from wealthy nations for water and sanitation has declined in real terms, dwindling to just 5 percent of all development assistance from 8 percent in the mid-1990\u2019s; by contrast, aid commitments for education doubled over the same period, this year\u2019s Human Development Report noted. \nJapan is by far the leader in aid for water and sanitation projects around the world, providing $850 million in 2003-2004, one-fifth of the global total.\nSome innovative efforts to expand the availability of latrines and simple sewage systems have sprung up in South Asia. \nIn Karachi, Pakistan, a local group began in 1980 to organize slum dwellers lane by lane to build sewer channels to collect waste from their homes. Entire neighborhoods then collaborated to construct larger channels, and the city eventually agreed to finance a trunk sewer line. The infant mortality rate in the slum, Orangi, has fallen to 40 deaths for each 1,000 live births, from 130 in the early 1980\u2019s.\nIn Bangladesh, more than 600 charitable and aid groups are working with local communities to map the places where people defecate and the routes of disease transmission, a project that is fueling the demand for better sanitation services there. Some 3,000 small businesses have sprung up in the country to produce, market and maintain cheap latrines.\nAnd in India, Sulabh, a nongovernmental organization, has built thousands of public toilets and more than one million private latrines, costing as little as $10 each, in more than 1,000 cities and towns across the country. Local authorities pay for construction of the public toilets, but maintenance is financed by the small fee \u2014 about two cents \u2014 that people who use the toilets pay. Children, the disabled and the destitute are exempted from the fee. ",

    "text": "The end of the West as we know it? - Opinion - International Herald Tribune\n2006-12-28T05:00:00.000Z\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Every political, social and economic system ever created has sooner or later encountered a challenge that its very nature has made it incapable of meeting. The Confucian ruling system of imperial China, which lasted for more than 2,000 years, has some claim still to be the most successful in history, but because it was founded on values of stability and continuity, rather than dynamism and inventiveness, it eventually proved unable to survive in the face of Western imperial capitalism.\nFor market economies, and the Western model of democracy with which they have been associated, the existential challenge for the foreseeable future will be global warming. Other threats like terrorism may well be damaging, but no other conceivable threat or combination of threats can possibly destroy our entire system. As the recent British official commission chaired by Sir Nicholas Stern correctly stated, climate change \"is the greatest and widest-ranging market failure ever seen.\"\nThe question now facing us is whether global capitalism and Western democracy can follow the Stern report's recommendations, and make the limited economic adjustments necessary to keep global warming within bounds that will allow us to preserve our system in a recognizable form; or whether our system is so dependent on unlimited consumption that it is by its nature incapable of demanding even small sacrifices from its present elites and populations.\nIf the latter proves the case, and the world suffers radically destructive climate change, then we must recognize that everything that the West now stands for will be rejected by future generations. The entire democratic capitalist system will be seen to have failed utterly as a model for humanity and as a custodian of essential human interests.\nEven the relatively conservative predictions offered by the Stern report, of a drop in annual global gross domestic product of up to 20 percent by the end of this century, imply a crisis on the scale of the Great Depression of the 1930s; and as we know, the effects of that depression were not restricted to economics. In much of Europe, as well as Latin America and Japan, democracies collapsed and were replaced by authoritarian regimes.\nAs the report makes clear, however, if we continue with \"business as usual\" when it comes to the emission of greenhouse gases, then we will not have to wait till the end of the century to see disastrous consequences. Long before then, a combination of floods, droughts and famine will have destroyed states in many poorer parts of the earth \u2014 as has already occurred in recent decades in Somalia.\nIf the conservative estimates of the Stern report are correct, then already by 2050 the effects of climate change may be such as to wreck the societies of Pakistan and Bangladesh; and if these states collapse, how can India and other countries possibly insulate themselves?\nAt that point, not only will today's obsessive concern with terrorism appear insignificant, but all the democratizing efforts of Western states, and of private individuals and bodies like George Soros and his Open Society Institute, will be rendered completely meaningless. So, of course, will every effort directed today toward the reduction of poverty and disease.\nAnd this is only to examine the likely medium-term consequences of climate change. For the further future, the report predicts that if we continue with business as usual, then the rise in average global temperature could well top 5 degrees Celsius. To judge by what we know of the history of the world's climate, this would almost certainly lead to the melting of the polar ice caps, and a rise in sea levels of up to 25 meters.\nAs pointed out by Al Gore in \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" this would mean the end of many of the world's greatest cities. The resulting human migration could be on such a scale as to bring modern civilization to an end.\nIf this comes to pass, what will our descendants make of a political and media culture that devotes little attention to this threat when compared with sports, consumer goods, leisure and a threat from terrorism that is puny by comparison? Will they remember us as great paragons of human progress and freedom? They are more likely to spit on our graves.\nUnderlying Western free-market democracy, and its American form in particular, is the belief that this system is of permanent value to mankind: a \"New Order of the Ages,\" as the motto on the U.S. Great Seal has it. It is not supposed to serve only the short- term and selfish interests of existing Western populations. If our system is indeed no more than that, then it will pass from history even more utterly than Confucian China \u2014 and will deserve to do so.",

    "text": "World Bank battle: How to fight graft? - Business - International Herald Tribune\n2006-09-13T05:00:00.000Z\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In his first 15 months as president of the World Bank, Paul Wolfowitz has made the fight against corruption in poor countries a hallmark issue, waging an aggressive campaign that has led to the suspension of hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and contracts to countries including India, Chad, Kenya, Congo, Ethiopia and Bangladesh.\nIn recent months, however, Wolfowitz's drive has run into a flood of criticism within the bank and among financial officials in Europe and in poor countries. These officials charge that countries are being threatened with arbitrary punishment in a way that jeopardizes the bank's historic mission to reduce poverty.\nFew at the World Bank dispute that corruption is a problem, but the rift over Wolfowitz's approach has grown deep and bitter, according to more than a dozen bank officials recently interviewed.\nWolfowitz has begun firing back at his critics in internal meetings and public statements. He notes that under his leadership, bank lending actually went up last year, to nearly $23 billion.\n\"The assistance we provide needs to be used for the intended purposes,\" Wolfowitz told reporters recently. \"And the intended purposes are to send children to school, to help mothers be healthier, to provide jobs for poor people - not to have resources siphoned off into the hands of the corrupt and greedy.\"\nWolfowitz added that he has tried to rebut what he calls the myth that combating fraud is \"somehow at odds with development or becomes an excuse not to provide assistance.\"\nRoberto Danino, a senior vice president of the bank until this year, said, \"Anti-corruption efforts are an essential part of development finance. But getting rid of corruption is not a silver bullet. The bank should not overemphasize its anti-corruption agenda at the expense of other policies required for development.\"\nWhile no one knows how much of the bank's resources are improperly diverted, informal estimates range from 10 percent to the 25 percent that Wolfowitz says went to corrupt cronies and family members of Indonesia's leadership in the 1990s.\nThe backlash at the bank against Wolfowitz's approach centers not on his intentions or goals but on a widespread fear that countries will be categorized in the future as corrupt or not corrupt, and that lending will be shut off in an arbitrary or selective way.\nSeveral recent decisions to halt funding have been based on suspicions of corruption, but a major cause for concern was a decision by the bank last year to suspend $800 million in loans for maternal and children's health in India in response to allegations that illicit payments were going to state and central government officials.\nSome bank officials say that the widespread concern about Wolfowitz's approach reflects lingering doubts among many in the international aid community about his selection for the bank post by President George W. Bush. The doubts center on Wolfowitz's role as an architect of the Iraq war.\nWolfowitz's zeal on corruption also reminds many critics of what they say was his messianic but unrealistic faith that installing democracy by force in Iraq, and by other means throughout the Middle East, would bring stability to the region.\nThe criticism of Wolfowitz's approach has been especially sharp among Europeans at the bank, where many officials say that judgments about what constitutes \"good governance\" could rupture the bank's delicate relationships with recipient countries, especially if the judgments are based on information gathered from dissidents and other critics in those countries.\n\"We must not use corruption as an excuse for a massive withdrawal of our help,\" said a senior French finance official involved in discussions with the bank. The official was among many who agreed to discuss the internal debate only on condition of anonymity.\nWolfowitz acknowledges that his decision to suspend or delay loans, contracts and debt relief funds for many countries has provoked an outcry, but he notes that in almost every case, the funding was restored after safeguards were set up.\nIn recent months, Wolfowitz and his aides have been negotiating with skeptical members of the bank's board of 24 executive directors from around the world on guidelines for how corruption issues are to be handled. Several of the meetings have been contentious, participants say.\nThis week the board forwarded a draft of the guidelines and policies for approval by the world's finance ministers at the annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund next week in Singapore. Many officials said they expected the arguments to continue there and into any implementation phase in the future.\nDuring an interview, Wolfowitz acknowledged that the idea of drafting a paper on bank policies on corruption was urged on him by the board's members out of fear that he would punish countries without consulting them.\nWolfowitz said he did not take the criticism as personally directed at him or his record on Iraq.\n\"I think some of the board members are legitimately afraid that as soon as you start criticizing, the next thing you're going to do is wag your finger and say you're not going to get money unless you behave,\" he said. \"That's not our objective. Our objective is to make the lending go up.\"\nThe past actions taken by the bank to halt funding based on suspicions of corruption involved numerous alleged improprieties. For example, aides to Wolfowitz said he suspended debt relief talks with Congo because he was dissatisfied with audits of its state oil company. In addition, they said Wolfowitz expressed indignation over news reports about the extravagant hotel bills incurred by Congo's president during United Nations General Assembly meetings in New York last September.\nThere were also allegations of corrupt bidding practices for road projects in Bangladesh, kickbacks to politicians in Argentina and a program for poor workers there and the resignation of high officials in Kenya linked to projects there.\nBut by all accounts the pivotal moment in Wolfowitz's campaign came when the bank suspended its program to funding health initiatives in India.\n\"It sent a tremor through the bank that Wolfowitz was serious, that he was going to ask hard questions, look at the track record of countries and make some changes,\" said Nancy Boswell, president of Transparency International USA, a nongovernmental monitoring group that strongly supports Wolfowitz's anti-corruption efforts.\nBut many in the bank complained that the action was taken without consultation, and protests were lodged by top aides to Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, bank officials said.\nFew would characterize the bank's 10,000 employees, 70 percent of whom work in Washington, as enthusiastic supporters of the Bush administration. Since taking office, Wolfowitz has told staff members that he wants to listen to them. He has impressed many with his many trips to Africa and advocacy of debt relief for the poorest countries.\nBut distrust of Wolfowitz remains high among the employees, in part because some feel he has not given sufficient credit to his predecessor, James Wolfensohn, who spoke out against corruption and set up the bank's first investigative unit in the late 1990s.\nWhen Wolfowitz arrived, he acknowledged his predecessor's efforts but also complained that the fraud unit had more than 300 unresolved cases. He increased its budget by nearly 50 percent and appointed a new director to the office.\nCurrently, about 330 companies accused of corruption have been barred from bank-financed business or have been given other penalties.\nSupporters of Wolfowitz say he is determined to shake up the bank and that his efforts were inspired by bank employees. They say he has had to battle a mentality at the bank that emphasizes loan programs, not crackdowns on corrupt individuals. Wolfowitz said in the interview that the sometimes contentious exercise of drafting a policy by the bank's board was itself healthy.\n\"It's an injustice to the developing countries and their people when we hide problems,\" he said. \"What we've done is empower people in the field who no longer want to accept the status quo.\"",

    "text": "Labor Shortage in China May Lead to Trade Shift\n2006-04-03T05:00:00.000Z\nCorrection Appended\nSHENZHEN, China - Persistent labor shortages at hundreds of Chinese factories have led experts to conclude that the economy is undergoing a profound change that will ripple through the global market for manufactured goods.\nThe shortage of workers is pushing up wages and swelling the ranks of the country's middle class, and it could make Chinese-made products less of a bargain worldwide. International manufacturers are already talking about moving factories to lower-cost countries like Vietnam.\nAt the Well Brain factory here in one of China's special economic zones, the changes are clear. Over the last year, Well Brain, a midsize producer of small electric appliances like hair rollers, coffee makers and hot plates, has raised salaries, improved benefits and even dispatched a team of recruiters to find workers in the countryside.\nThat kind of behavior was unheard of as recently as three years ago, when millions of young people were still flooding into booming Shenzhen searching for any type of work.\nA few years ago, \"people would just show up at the door,\" said Liang Jian, the human resources manager at Well Brain. \"Now we put up an ad looking for five people, and maybe one person shows up.\"\nFor all the complaints of factory owners, though, the situation has a silver lining for the members of the world's largest labor force. Economists say the shortages are spurring companies to improve labor conditions and to more aggressively recruit workers with incentives and benefits.\nThe changes also suggest that China may already be moving up the economic ladder, as workers see opportunities beyond simply being unskilled assemblers of the world's goods. Rising wages may also prompt Chinese consumers to start buying more products from other countries, helping to balance the nation's huge trade surpluses.\n\"The next great story in China is how they are going to move out of the lower-end stuff: the toys, textiles and sporting goods equipment,\" said Jonathan Anderson, an economist at UBS in Hong Kong. \"They're going to do different things.\"\nWhen sporadic labor shortages first appeared in late 2004, government leaders dismissed them as short-lived anomalies. But they now say the problem is likely to be a more persistent one. Experts say the shortages are arising primarily because China's economy is sizzling hot, tax cuts have helped keep people working on farms, and factories are continuing to expand even as the number of young Chinese starts to level off.\nProsperity is also moving inland, and workers who might earlier have migrated elsewhere are staying closer to home.\nThough estimates are hard to come by, data from officials suggest that major export industries are looking for at least one million additional workers, and the real number could be much higher.\n\"We're seeing an end to the golden period of extremely low-cost labor in China,\" said Hong Liang, a Goldman Sachs economist who has studied labor costs here. \"There are plenty of workers, but the supply of uneducated workers is shrinking.\"\nBecause of these shortages, wage levels throughout China's manufacturing ranks are rising, threatening at some point to weaken China's competitiveness on world markets.\nLi & Fung, one of the world's biggest trading companies, said recently that labor shortages and rising manufacturing costs in China were already forcing it to step up its diversification efforts and look for supplies from factories in other parts of Asia.\n\"I look at China a lot differently than I did three years ago,\" said Bruce Rockowitz, president of Li & Fung in Hong Kong, citing the rising costs of doing business in China. \"China is no longer the lowest-cost producer. There's an evolution going on. People are now going to Vietnam, and India and Bangladesh.\"\nThe higher wages come at a time when costs are already rising sharply across the country for energy and land. On top of a strengthening Chinese currency, this is likely to mean that the cost of consumer goods shipped to the United States and Europe will rise.\nTo be sure, China is not about to lose its title as factory floor of the world. And some analysts dispute the significance of the shortages.\n\"Reports of a shortage of unskilled and semi-skilled factory workers are overblown,\" said Andy Rothman, an analyst at CLSA, an investment bank. \"Companies are, however, having trouble finding experienced people to fill midlevel and senior management jobs.\"\nThe lack of workers is most acute in two of the country's most powerful export regions: the Pearl River Delta, which feeds into Hong Kong, and the Yangtze River Delta, which funnels into the country's financial capital, Shanghai. Wages are rising significantly in both areas.\nAccording to government figures, minimum wages -- which averaged $58 to $74 a month (not including benefits) in 2004 -- have climbed about 25 percent over the past three years in big cities like Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai, mostly by government mandate.\nWages at larger factories operated on behalf of multinationals -- which are typically $100 to $200 a month -- are also on the rise.\nHere in Shenzhen, one of the first cities to benefit from the country's economic reforms, factory operators say finding low-wage workers is harder than ever. At the Nantou Labor Market, where hordes of people used to come to find jobs, there are now mostly lonely employment agents.\n\"The people coming here are fewer and fewer,\" said a woman named Miss Li, who works at the Xingda Employment Agency. \"All the labor agencies face the same problem. A lot of young people are now going to the Yangtze River area, where there are higher salaries.\"\nIn Guangdong Province late last year, the government said factories were short more than 500,000 workers; and in Fujian Province, there was a shortage of 300,000.\nEven north of Shenzhen, Zhejiang Province, known for its brash entrepreneurs, is short about 200,000 to 300,000 workers this year, government officials say. The Wahaha Group, a Chinese beverage maker based in the city of Hangzhou, is one of the region's rising corporate stars. But one of the company's 500-worker factories is short by 50.\n\"It seems to become more and more serious year by year,\" said Sun Youguo, the company's human resources manager. \"Because of the shortage we're paying more attention to migrant workers. We're now building a dormitory to house couples.\"\nGovernment policy is playing a role in creating the coastal labor shortages. Trying to close the yawning income gap between the urban rich and the rural poor in China, the national government last year eliminated the agricultural tax, and it also stepped up efforts to develop local economies in poor, inland and western provinces, which have mostly been left behind.\nNow, even remote areas are starting to develop -- sprouting malls, housing projects, restaurants and infrastructure projects. These are creating jobs in the middle of the country and offering alternatives to many young workers who once were forced to travel thousands of miles for jobs on the coast.\nAccording to Goldman Sachs and other experts, the beginnings of a demographic shift have already been reducing the number of young people between the ages of 15 and 24, who make up much of the migrant labor work force. Similarly, the number of women between the ages of 18 and 35 began falling this year, according to census data.\nThe women are critical because China's factories like to hire many women from the countryside, who have been willing to migrate for three-to-five-year stints to earn money as factory workers before returning home with bundles of cash and fresh hopes of finding a marriage partner.\nChina's one-child policy is also aggravating the shortages. With the first generation of young people born under the one-child policy now emerging from postsecondary education, many of them see varied opportunities not available to an earlier generation.\n\"When the economic reform started, migrant workers were very hard-working, and usually stayed for a long time at factory jobs, but the new generation has changed,\" said Chen Guanghan, a professor at Zhongshan University in Hong Kong. \"They are reluctant to take factory jobs that are harsh and pay very little.\"\nMany are going to college to avoid the factory floor. Last year, Chinese colleges and universities enrolled over 14 million students, up from about 4.3 million in 1999.\nWorkers are sharing more information about factory conditions among friends and learning to bargain and leap from job to job. They are also increasingly ambitious.\n\"There's still a lot of cheap labor, but Chinese workers are getting skilled very quickly,\" said Ms. Hong at Goldman Sachs. \"They are moving up the value chain faster than people expected.\"\nEconomists may continue to debate the severity of the shortages, but there is little doubt that the waves of migrants who once crowded into the booming coastal provinces are diminishing.\nAs a result, manufacturers are already starting to look for other places to produce goods.\n\"Many companies are already moving to Wuhan, Chongqing and Hunan,\" Ms. Hong said, ticking off the names of inland Chinese cities. \"But Vietnam and Bangladesh are also benefiting. We're bullish on Vietnam.\"\nCorrection: April 10, 2006, Monday A front-page article last Monday about labor shortages in China misstated the location of Zhongshan University, where Chen Guanghan, who discussed the change in attitudes among workers, is a professor. It is in Guangzhou, not Hong Kong.",

The doubts center on Wolfowitz's role as an architect of the Iraq war.\nWolfowitz's zeal on corruption also reminds many critics of what they say was his messianic but unrealistic faith that installing democracy by force in Iraq, and by other means throughout the Middle East, would bring stability to the region.\nThe criticism of Wolfowitz's approach has been especially sharp among European officials at the bank, where many officials say that judgments about what constitutes \"good governance\" could rupture the bank's delicate relationships with recipient countries, especially if the judgments are based on information gathered from dissidents and other critics in those countries.\n\"We must not use corruption as an excuse for a massive withdrawal of our help,\" said a senior French finance official involved in discussions with the bank. The official was among many who agreed to discuss the internal debate only on condition of anonymity.\nWolfowitz acknowledges that his decision to suspend or delay loans, contracts and debt relief funds for many countries has provoked an outcry, but he notes that in almost every case, the funding was restored after safeguards were set up.\nIn recent months, Wolfowitz and his aides have been negotiating with skeptical members of the bank's board of 24 executive directors from around the world on guidelines for how corruption issues are to be handled. Several of the meetings have been contentious, participants say.\nThis week the board forwarded a draft of the guidelines and policies for approval by the world's finance ministers at the annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund next week in Singapore. Many officials said they expected the arguments to continue there and into any implementation phase in the future.\nWolfowitz acknowledged during an interview that the board had urged the drafting of a paper on bank policies on corruption, out of fear that he would punish countries without consulting them.\nHe said he did not take the criticism as personally directed at him or his record on Iraq.\n\"I think some of the board members are legitimately afraid that as soon as you start criticizing, the next thing you're going to do is wag your finger and say you're not going to get money unless you behave,\" he said. \"That's not our objective. Our objective is to make the lending go up.\"\nThe past actions taken by the bank to halt funding based on suspicions of corruption involved numerous alleged improprieties. For example, aides to Wolfowitz said he suspended debt relief talks with Congo because he was dissatisfied with audits of its state oil company. In addition, they said Wolfowitz expressed indignation over news reports about the extravagant hotel bills incurred by Congo's president during United Nations General Assembly meetings in New York last September.\nThere were also allegations of corrupt bidding practices for road projects in Bangladesh, kickbacks to politicians in Argentina and a program for poor workers there and the resignation of high officials in Kenya linked to projects there.\nBut by all accounts the pivotal moment in Wolfowitz's campaign came when the bank suspended its program to funding health initiatives in India.\n\"It sent a tremor through the bank that Wolfowitz was serious, that he was going to ask hard questions, look at the track record of countries and make some changes,\" said Nancy Boswell, president of Transparency International USA, a nongovernmental monitoring group that strongly supports Wolfowitz's anti-corruption efforts, referring to the India decision.\nBut many in the bank complained that the action was taken without consultation, and protests were lodged by top aides to Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, bank officials said. The India decision led to the bank board's demand for a governance paper guiding future actions, several officials said.\nFew would characterize the bank's 10,000 employees, 70 percent of whom work in Washington, as enthusiastic supporters of the Bush administration. Since taking office, Wolfowitz has told staff members that he wants to listen to them. He has impressed many with his many trips to Africa and advocacy of debt relief for the poorest countries.\nBut distrust of Wolfowitz remains high among the employees, in part because some feel he has not given sufficient credit to his predecessor, James Wolfensohn, who spoke out against corruption and set up the bank's first investigative unit in the late 1990s.\nWhen Wolfowitz arrived, he acknowledged his predecessor's efforts but also complained that the fraud unit had more than 300 unresolved cases. He increased its budget by nearly 50 percent and appointed a new director to the office. He has also set up a program for companies to disclose voluntarily the bribes they paid to avoid being sanctioned.\nCurrently, about 330 companies accused of corruption have been barred from bank-financed business or have been given other penalties. The bank is trying to get other countries and international aid agencies to take similar actions against them.\nSupporters of Wolfowitz say he is determined to shake up the bank and that his efforts were inspired by bank employees, especially those posted around the world. They say he has had to battle a mentality at the bank that emphasizes loan programs, not crackdowns on corrupt individuals. Wolfowitz said in the interview that the sometimes contentious exercise of drafting a policy by the bank's board was itself healthy.\n\"It's an injustice to the developing countries and their people when we hide problems,\" he said. \"What we've done is empower people in the field who no longer want to accept the status quo.\"",

    "text": "China starts to ship higher costs abroad - Business - International Herald Tribune\n2006-08-23T05:00:00.000Z\nFRANKFURT \u2014 During 20 years in the toy business, Anthony Temple has reveled in the bounty of inexpensive stuffed animals, coffee mugs and resin figurines on sale in China. But a buying trip this year for his company, Rainbow Designs, based in London, marked a rude awakening.\nTraveling through the Pearl River Delta north of Hong Kong, Temple found that cost increases - of raw materials, but above all labor - dominated every discussion he had with suppliers.\nFar from being keen to underbid each other, Chinese companies talked about marking up their prices from 5 percent to 10 percent so consistently that Temple, whose company owns the British distribution rights to such cuddly creatures as Paddington Bear and Jemima Puddle- Duck, became convinced that these were not simply negotiating gambits.\n\"When I went over there, I was under the belief that China is a bottomless pit of cheap product,\" Temple said. \"When I left, I was not.\"\nAs the Chinese economy races forward, signs are multiplying through the global flow of goods from suppliers to manufacturers - and deep in some statistical tables - that the Asian giant is beginning to slow its exporting of something dear to the hearts of the world's central bankers: lower prices.\nFor at least a decade, China has provided a welcome tail wind for inflation fighters in Europe and the United States by supplying inexpensive goods that depressed overall price levels.\nBut in the course of this year, China's role in global disinflation - as the phenomenon is known to economists - has toughened the agenda for central bankers. Telling anecdotes and ever- more statistical evidence suggest that China's contribution to low prices may be ebbing.\nAnd that, combined with more expensive raw materials like oil, means that central banks once again could be stuck with the painful dilemma that they faced in the early 1980s: to stop inflation by tightening credit, despite the potentially negative effects on economic growth and unemployment.\n\"Even in China, with its growing manufacturing base and large pool of labor, some indicators are showing upward pressures on export prices,\" Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, said in a recent speech. \"And in turn that is raising our import prices, over and above the increases resulting from higher energy costs.\"\nAfter discussing the \"China effect\" this spring, the European Central Bank vowed to step up research into the phenomenon. Top officials of the U.S. Federal Reserve have begun speaking out about it. China's role in global inflation is also likely to be an important topic at the annual conference of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, which starts Friday.\nIn recent months, China has already been exporting higher prices indirectly, given that its voracious appetite for oil and other commodities has helped drive up costs for everyone. Now, however, the prospect of higher prices for finished goods has become an obsession of sorts in the supply-chain business, according to interviews with dozens of retailers, importers, independent consultants and trade associations in Europe and the United States.\n\"We may well be reaching a situation where prices of both commodities and manufactured goods will go up,\" said Kenneth Rogoff, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund. \"That's not pleasant at all.\"\nChina's development has brought it to this point, economists said. Low-cost labor and easy access to a world-class port in Hong Kong allowed China to flood the world with inexpensive goods. But now, atop high prices for raw materials, Chinese workers are starting to demand higher pay, creating the classic conditions for rising export prices.\n\"Raw materials are going up, the price of oil is going up, wages are going up,\" said Peter Keller, managing director of Merton Co., a plastic-toy manufacturer based in Hong Kong. \"It is true that costs in China are rising and where possible cost increases are passed on.\"\nMerton is facing rapid increases in wages at its plant in Guangdong Province, part of China's booming manufacturing heartland of the Pearl River Delta. On Sept. 1, the minimum wage is set to increase by about 20 percent to 780 yuan, or $98, a month in the province.\nIntense competition is still squeezing profit margins, but Keller estimated that prices for products produced under new contracts would be 5 percent to 10 percent higher than they would otherwise be as a result of the higher wages and raw material bills.\nThe good news for consumers is that rising costs in China are not feeding into higher prices on store shelves yet.\nThe Swedish retailer H&M, which last year had sales of \u20ac7.8 billion, or $10 billion, is trying to keep prices down as its suppliers demand more, said Nils Vinge, director of investor relations. Some strategies, like shifting production to low-wage Bangladesh or Turkey, with less expensive transportation costs to Europe, can mitigate the impact, though not forever.\n\"In the long run, this makes its way to the consumer,\" Vinge said. \"In the short run, it does not.\"\nData suggest that Europe and the United States are, like H&M, somewhere between the short and long runs.\nInflation has hovered slightly above 2 percent for most of this decade in the 12-nation euro zone, but has been rising lately. It was at an annual rate of 4.8 percent last month in the United States.\nThe Bank of England's most recent inflation report notes that even stripping out volatile energy and metal prices, the country's inflation was at an annual rate of 5 percent. It also highlighted a turnaround in prices of British imports since 2004. The ECB pointed out a similar euro-zone trend in its latest monthly report. It also noted that low-cost countries like China had helped to reduce the inflation rate for imported goods by two percentage points yearly from 1996 to 2005.\nIn the United States, data show that Chinese import prices, which have fallen since data collection began in 2003, are leveling off, as are prices from other low-cost emerging markets.\nThe few leading indicators on prices out of China paint a much starker picture. The price of Chinese goods at the factory gates has climbed in the past four months, according to the purchasing managers survey taken by NTC Research in London. Its index was below 50 - a level indicating stable prices - in March but now stands at 56.\nStill, not all economists buy the overall notion that Chinese prices will soon pump up inflation rates in the industrialized world - and force central bankers to press harder on the brakes. Skeptics tend to focus on the ability of China and its customers to adapt.\nAs Chinese costs increase, foreign investors can set up shop in lower-cost manufacturing centers like India and Bangladesh. Other companies will investigate China's vast interior to escape rising labor costs on the coast. \"The global labor arbitrage is alive and well,\" said Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley. \"It still pays very much to relocate production and employment to China to keep your labor costs down.\"\nASDA, the British subsidiary of the U.S. retail giant Wal-Mart, just invested \u00a320 million, or $37.8 million, to build its own deepwater port on the eastern English coast, and 80 percent of the goods moving through it are likely to come from China. A spokesman for ASDA, Dominic Burch, said that the company also saw Chinese prices rising, but that China's deep pool of high-quality goods meant that the company had to buy there.\n\"From a trading aspect, we are not going anywhere,\" Burch said.\nTemple of Rainbow Designs said he had managed to contain cost increases from China through a mix of tough negotiating and lower profit. But soon enough, the retailers he supplies, like WH Smith, Harrods and Selfridges, will find themselves under intense pressure to raise prices, he believes.\n\"These prices have to be passed down to the retail chain next year,\" Temple said. \"Prices have to go up.\"",

Some strategies, like shifting production to low-wage Bangladesh or Turkey, with lower transportation costs to Europe, can mitigate the impact, though not forever. \"In the long run, this makes its way to the consumer,\" Vinge said. \"In the short run, it does not.\"\nData suggest that Europe and the United States are, like H&M, somewhere between the short and long runs.\nInflation has hovered slightly above 2 percent for most of this decade in the 12-nation euro zone, but has been rising lately. It was at an annual rate of 4.8 percent last month in the United States.\nThe Bank of England's most recent inflation report notes that even stripping out volatile energy and metal prices, the country's inflation was at an annual rate of 5 percent. It also highlighted a turnaround in prices of British imports since 2004. The ECB pointed out a similar euro-zone trend in its latest monthly report. It also noted that low-cost countries like China had helped to reduce the inflation rate for imported goods by two percentage points yearly from 1996 to 2005.\nIn the United States, data show that Chinese import prices, which have fallen since data collection began in 2003, are leveling off, as are prices from other low-cost emerging markets.\nThe few leading indicators on prices out of China paint a much starker picture. The price of Chinese goods at the factory gates has climbed in the past four months, according to the purchasing managers survey taken by NTC Research in London. Its index was below 50 - a level indicating stable prices - in March but now stands at 56.\nStill, not all economists buy the overall notion that Chinese prices will soon pump up inflation rates in the industrialized world - and force central bankers to press harder on the brakes. Skeptics tend to focus on the ability of China and its customers to adapt.\nAs Chinese costs increase, foreign investors can set up shop in lower-cost manufacturing centers like India and Bangladesh. Other companies will investigate China's vast interior to escape rising labor costs on the coast. \"The global labor arbitrage is alive and well,\" said Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley. \"It still pays very much to relocate production and employment to China to keep your labor costs down.\"\nASDA, the British subsidiary of the U.S. retail giant Wal-Mart, just invested \u00a320 million, or $37.8 million, to build its own deepwater port on the eastern English coast, and 80 percent of the goods moving through it are likely to come from China. A spokesman for ASDA, Dominic Burch, said that the company also saw Chinese prices rising, but that China's deep pool of high-quality goods meant that it had to buy there.\n\"From a trading aspect, we are not going anywhere,\" Burch said.\nTemple of Rainbow Designs said he had managed to contain cost increases from China through a mix of tough negotiating and lower profit. But soon enough, the retailers he supplies, like WH Smith, Harrods and Selfridges, will find themselves under intense pressure to raise prices, he believes.\n\"These prices have to be passed down to the retail chain next year,\" Temple said. \"Prices have to go up.\"\nDonald Greenlees contributed reporting from Hong Kong.\nStudy backs 3% rise in yuan\nChina can afford to let its currency, the yuan, climb by 3 percent a year as part of steps to rebalance the economy, but a sharp rise in the currency would affect jobs, according to a Commerce Ministry research group, Reuters reported Wednesday from Beijing.\nThe Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, in a report published on the ministry's Web site, urged the central bank to handle the currency cautiously.\nThe Commerce Ministry has been among the staunchest opponents of a sharp rise in the yuan. But the academy said a gradual climb would help rein in excess liquidity and head off inflation.",

    "text": "A crisis of young and old in China's birth rate - Asia - Pacific - International Herald Tribune\n2006-06-28T05:00:00.000Z\nSHANGHAI \u2014 Shanghai is rightfully known as a fast-moving, hypermodern city full of youth and vigor. But that obscures a less-well-known fact: Shanghai has the oldest population in China, and it is getting older in a hurry.\nTwenty percent of this city's population of 13.6 million is over 59, the official retirement age in Shanghai, and retirees are easily the fastest-growing segment of the population, with 100,000 new seniors added to the rolls each year. By 2020, about a third of Shanghai's residents will be over 59, remaking the city's social fabric and placing huge new strains on its economy and finances.\nThe changes go far beyond Shanghai, however. Experts say the rapidly graying city is leading one of the greatest demographic changes in history, one with profound implications for the entire country.\nChina, which has built its economic strength on the basis of seemingly endless supplies of cheap labor, could soon face manpower shortages. An aging population may also damage the credibility of the Communist government, which manufactured this historic shift with its one-child policy.\nIntroduced a generation ago, the birth control policy, strongly enforced in urban areas, has spared the country an estimated 390 million births, but may ultimately prove to be a monumental mistake. With China's breathtaking rise toward affluence, most people live longer and have fewer children, mirroring trends seen around the world. But the extraordinarily low birth rate has created a stark imbalance between young and old.\nThat imbalance threatens the country's pension system. Demographers also expect strains on the household registration system, which restricts internal migration.\nThe system prevents young workers from migrating to urban areas to relieve labor shortages, but officials fear that abolishing it could release a flood of humanity that would swamp the cities and depopulate the countryside.\n\"For the last two decades, China has enjoyed the advantage of having a high ratio of working-age people in the population, but that situation is about to change,\" said Zuo Xuejin, vice president of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. \"With the working-age population decreasing, our labor costs will become less competitive, and industries in places like Vietnam and Bangladesh will start becoming more attractive.\"\nEven within China, Zuo said, many foreign investors have begun moving factories away from Shanghai and other eastern cities to inland locations where the work force is both cheaper and younger.\nAs remote as many of these problems may seem today in Shanghai, the country's most prosperous city, evidence of the changes is already on display. If Shanghai represents the future of China, it is in Jing'an - a central Shanghai district where about 4,000 people, or 30 percent of the residents, are above 60 - where one can glimpse that future.\nSquads of lightly trained social workers monitor the city's elderly, paying regular house visits to combat isolation and ensuring that medical problems are attended to. At 10 a.m. on a recent spring morning, Chen Meijuan walked up a narrow and rickety wooden stairway to the second-floor apartment where Liang Yunyu has lived for the past 58 years.\n\"Good morning, granny,\" she called out as she entered the 100-year-old woman's small bedroom. \"Did you have a good night's sleep?\"\nChen, 49, earns about $95 a month as one of the 15 agents who are responsible for monitoring the neighborhood's elderly. Her caseload includes more than 200 seniors. \"I usually pay visits to about five or six households a day, stay a little while and chat with them,\" Chen said.\nAfter being introduced to a foreign visitor, Liang regales her guests with stories ranging across the decades of the 20th century.\n\"My daughter always invites me to live with her family, but I feel embarrassed to be with them,\" Liang said. \"I'm worried I might die in her home, so I prefer staying where I am.\"\nHer son, Zha Yuheng, a 76-year-old grandfather and retired textile industry worker, lives with her now, which also concerns her, she says.\n\"I am taken good care of here, but living with my son leaves him with a big burden, I'm afraid,\" she said.\nIn many wealthy societies, the very old are candidates for nursing home care. That sector is still tiny in China, though, especially compared with the size of the elderly population.\nZhang Minsheng opened the city's first private nursing home in 1998, a rambling, 350-bed affair in an industrial area far from central Shanghai that is now 95 percent occupied.\n\"People were not willing to enter nursing homes in the past because they were considered places for those without descendants,\" Zhang said. \"Now, from the standpoint of ordinary people, it is becoming a normal thing.\"\nThe average age of the residents of Zhang's home is 85, and most live several to a room, sleeping on narrow beds separated by flimsy partitions. Many pass the daytime hours in long corridors furnished with chairs, where they chat or simply stare into the distance.\nChina has a patchwork of retirement ages, ranging generally from 50 to 60. Raising the retirement age would relieve pressures on the pension system but make it harder for young people to find jobs and would be resented by many of the elderly, most of whom have missed out on China's economic boom.\nLifting restrictions on internal migration raises the unwelcome prospect of a mass migration, while abandoning the one-child policy would be politically unpalatable. And the government has already tinkered with that policy. It now allows husbands and wives who are themselves only children to have a second child, for example, and has eliminated a four-year waiting period between births for those eligible to have a second child.\nBut Chinese demographic experts say that the leadership would resist more radical measures, because it is loath to acknowledge that one of the most ambitious social experiments of the 20th century, one conceived and carried out by the ruling Communist Party, was in any way a failure. Moreover, lifting child-bearing restrictions might not help.\nPoorer people in the interior might have more children, but the rising middle class probably will not, experts say.",

    "text": "For Pakistan, American Aid Is All Guns, No Butter\n2006-02-16T05:00:00.000Z\nLAHORE, Pakistan - Syed Jawad Ahsan's Valentine's Day this year was a heartbreaking window into the box in which this country is trapped.\nAround 10:30 on Tuesday morning, Mr. Ahsan, chief executive of Irfan Textiles Pvt. Ltd., got into his car and headed for the factory just outside town where his workers, some 5,000 of them, stitch and weave underwear for Jockey. As he was leaving Lahore's outskirts, he saw some boys in the middle of the road, setting fire to car tires. A group of Sunni parties had called for yet another of the seemingly never-ending protests against the Danish cartoon caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, and the boys had apparently decided that torching tires on their own turf would teach the West a thing or two.\nMr. Ahsan threw his car into reverse and started to back away. But behind him, another group had gathered, throwing rocks at a parked car, breaking its windows and slashing its tires. Frustrated, Mr. Ahsan turned left and made a quick exit, heading back to town. Using his cellphone, he called and left a message that I should meet him at his downtown office for our interview on Pakistan's textile industry. \"I think it's safer for us in town today,\" he said.\nAn hour later, we were drinking Pepsi and eating crackers in his office in Lahore. Mr. Ahsan was visibly saddened. \"Pakistan didn't used to be like this,\" he said. \"All this extremism that you see here now is because of Afghanistan.\"\nHe meant the Afghanistan war that started in 1979, not the one that came after Sept. 11. The way Mr. Ahsan sees it, Pakistan before 1979 was a much more open society, with wine bars in the cities and a small measure of freedom. But when the Russians invaded Afghanistan, America responded by arming, and largely creating, the Islamist fighters who drummed up religious fire in their war to drive out the Russians. Next door, Pakistan became a front-line state, and American money flooded to the mujahedeen. Ever since, Pakistan has been home to a growing cadre of fundamentalist Islamists, many of them bent on jihad.\nWith the huge gap here between rich and poor, militants find young boys with nothing to do easy prey. Mr. Ahsan can't fathom why Americans aren't working on the economic conditions that breed discontent.\n\"We don't need more of your F-16's,\" he said. \"What we need is trade in textiles. We need a free trade agreement, like the one you're going to give Egypt, like the one you gave Jordan, like the one you gave Morocco.\"\nThe United States agreed in 2005 to resume sales of F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan. The sales had been suspended for more than a decade because Pakistan began developing nuclear weapons. But Washington has refused to grant a bigger and far more important concession: duty-free access for Pakistani imports.\nIf there is a stronger case than Pakistan's for duty-free access, it is certainly hard to find. This place is a breeding ground for Muslim extremists, but it also has a population and government that has, by and large, maintained cordial relations with America. Pakistan's biggest industry is textiles, accounting for 45 percent of its manufacturing jobs, and its biggest market is the United States. Pakistani factories make everything from bras to shirts and sheets for companies like Wal-Mart, Polo Ralph Lauren and Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.\nSince Sept. 11, it's been an uphill battle for such Pakistani companies. American buyers have been skittish about trusting their orders to a place that looks like a war zone on TV. Meanwhile, other countries, including China, Bangladesh and India, have been quick to try to woo business away. The overwhelming belief here is that without duty-free access to the U.S. market, the textile and apparel industry here can't compete.\nMr. Ahsan says his knitwear exports are down 17 percent in the past year alone, and he believes that Pakistan's knitwear industry -- the staple of its textile industry -- is dying. This week, another knitting factory in Lahore became a casualty: 1,000 jobs will be eliminated, although the workers haven't yet been told.\nIt is the end of our interview, and Mr. Ahsan and I have spent as much time talking about religion and why Muslims are so upset about the cartoons as we have about trade and textiles. Reaching into his back pocket, he pulled out a Muslim prayer book -- he said a friend had given to him to help him get through the difficult times he is facing as he tries to keep his business together.\nHe said he was waiting to see whether President Bush's visit next month would produce any new American promises to help Pakistan on trade, but he admits that if past is prologue, Pakistan will come away empty-handed on what really counts. \"Textile trade, not F-16's, is the only thing the U.S. should do if at all U.S. wanted to mellow extremism here,\" he said. \"It must be employment.\"\nI left him and headed to a Lahore suburb to meet some friends. About a half-hour later, the mob of boys, now thousands strong, reached Lahore's downtown area, which locals call the mall. They ransacked around 500 cars, burned 75 motorcycles and 10 other vehicles, and torched the Punjab Assembly. A bank security guard opened fire and killed two boys. Three others were shot and injured.\nThe mob then turned to the business district, setting fire to a Norwegian cellphone company's office and a KFC. Nestled between those two buildings was an office belonging to Mr. Ahsan and his brother. It, too, was burned down.",

    "text": "An Outsider Confronts the Tide in the Marshes of Iraq\n2006-07-28T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Prince of the Marshes And Other Occupational Hazards of a Year in Iraq By Rory Stewart Illustrated. 396 pages. Harcourt. $25.\nThe southern Iraqi provinces of Maysan and Dhi Qar once included vast tracts of wetlands that were home to the marsh Arabs, who fished and tended buffalo on floating reed platforms. Like many other Shiites, the marsh Arabs rose against Saddam Hussein after the first gulf war and later paid the price. Mr. Hussein drained the marshes, bombed marsh villages and turned thousands of acres of wetland into desert.\nThe tribal leader, Karim Mahood Hattab, is known as the Prince of the Marshes. But in the aftermath of the American-led invasion, Maysan was given a second prince. This one was an adventurous 30-year-old Scot named Rory Stewart, a former soldier and diplomat who, after roaming the Islamic world for most of the previous decade, offered his services to the British Foreign Office and found himself installed as the chief administrator of a province of nearly a million Iraqis.\n\"The Prince of the Marshes\" is his rueful, richly detailed, often harrowing account of his yearlong efforts to build a new civil society from the ruins of the old Iraq.\nIt's getting hard to keep up with Mr. Stewart, who seems to travel the world in seven-league boots. In 2000, after retiring from the Foreign Service, he spent 20 months walking from Turkey to Bangladesh, a journey whose Afghan portion yielded a superlative travel book in the grand British tradition, \"The Places in Between.\" Readers of that book will no doubt pick up \"The Prince of the Marshes\" simply to follow the further adventures of Mr. Stewart, who seems to be living one of the more extraordinary lives on record. There is incident aplenty this time around, but the real value of the new book is Mr. Stewart's sobering picture of the difficulties involved in creating a coherent Iraqi state based on the rule of law.\nMr. Stewart entered Iraq as a realist. \"I thought there was a real limit to what I, as a foreigner, would be able to achieve, and that the country would remain, for some time, chaotic, corrupt and confusing,\" he writes. \"But I didn't think it would be too difficult to outperform Saddam.\"\nHe set small goals, with an emphasis on rebuilding schools, putting Iraqis to work and somehow convincing the local population that the American-led coalition was actually improving their lives. \"You've got the plum job,\" the local British general tells him on his arrival. \"Most fun province in Iraq.\"\nSome fun. War had left chaos and economic ruin in its wake, and the invaders were expected to solve all problems, immediately. \"I had spent my first week in Maysan,\" Mr. Stewart writes, \" deciding how to mediate in a tribal war, deal with a flood, regulate religious flagellants, advise on the architecture of the souk, patch a split within a political party, set up a television station, arrange an election and equip the police with guns.\" Most of the time, trapped in his office, Mr. Stewart receives supplicants. Many of them, pretending to represent political parties or tribes, want money, jobs or weapons. Their claims are impossible to sort out. The province has multiple political parties, dozens of tribal leaders and far too many clerics with political ambitions, some supported by Iran, other allied with the extremely dangerous militias of Moktada al-Sadr, the firebrand Shiite cleric. \"After a month I could recite the names of a hundred local leaders and 40 different tribes and parties,\" Mr. Stewart writes. And every knock at his door brought a new sheik.\nThe complexities are on full display when Mr. Stewart and his hard-working colleagues try to organize local representative assemblies. Essentially, each party and tribe wants a monopoly on power and money, especially the Prince of the Marshes, a favorite with the coalition because of his anti-Saddam credentials and secular views. Mr. Stewart, in trying to ensure a representative and inclusive council, alienates the prince, setting off a power struggle that lasts throughout Mr. Stewart's time in Iraq.\nThere are a handful of secular liberals in Maysan. They do not stand a chance against the Iran-oriented parties, which are keen to impose a theocracy, and the violence-prone Sadrists, all of them financed by Tehran and Damascus. \"The moderates could not hire a tea-boy; the extremists could hire an entire rioting crowd,\" Mr. Stewart writes.\nThe prince is happy to strike up temporary alliances with anyone who will advance his interests, and, as self-rule arrives, manages to get his brother Riyadh elected governor of the province. In their first meeting, he informs Mr. Stewart that he intends to take control of the police, create a secret intelligence service, ban demonstrations, arrest a journalist who had criticized him and expel his opponents on the local council.\nMr. Stewart describes the political struggles in Maysan, and later in Dhi Qar, his second posting, in sharp, sensitively observed vignettes that on occasion rise to the level of inspired farce. Unfortunately most of the principals have weapons and are ready to use them, and the outlandish statements of the actors translate into hard facts on the street, where women, under pressure from the religious parties, abandon modern dress and begin covering themselves head to foot in black abayas.\nMaysan and Dhi Qar, fairly peaceful provincial backwaters, gradually succumb to mayhem and violence. Mr. Stewart brings his yearlong diary to a conclusion with a thrilling shoot'em-up, an Alamo-like last stand in Nasiriya, where Sadrist forces attack coalition offices with mortars. It's a sad end to a story that begins with at least a glimmer of hope and a heap of good intentions.\nMr. Stewart, after attending a ceremony in June 2004 handing over governing power to the Iraqis, is approached by a leader of the mortar attack, a friend as it happens, who thanks him for his good work and tells him how much he will be missed. \"What are you talking about, Asad -- why were you firing mortars and trying to kill me five weeks ago?\" Mr. Stewart asks. The man grins. \"Ah, Sayyed Rory,\" he says, \"that was nothing personal.\"",

Mr. Stewart, in trying to ensure a representative and inclusive council, alienates the prince, setting off a power struggle that lasts throughout Mr. Stewart\u2019s time in Iraq.\nThere are a handful of secular liberals in Maysan. They do not stand a chance against the Iran-oriented parties, which are keen to impose a theocracy, and the violence-prone Sadrists, all of them financed by Tehran and Damascus. \u201cThe moderates could not hire a tea-boy; the extremists could hire an entire rioting crowd,\u201d Mr. Stewart writes. \nThe prince is happy to strike up temporary alliances with anyone who will advance his interests, and, as self-rule arrives, manages to get his brother Riyadh elected governor of the province. In their first meeting, he informs Mr. Stewart that he intends to take control of the police, create a secret intelligence service, ban demonstrations, arrest a journalist who had criticized him and expel his opponents on the local council.\nMr. Stewart describes the political struggles in Maysan, and later in Dhi Qar, his second posting, in sharp, sensitively observed vignettes that on occasion rise to the level of inspired farce. Unfortunately most of the principals have weapons and are ready to use them, and the outlandish statements of the actors translate into hard facts on the street, where women, under pressure from the religious parties, abandon modern dress and begin covering themselves head to foot in black abayas.\nMaysan and Dhi Qar, fairly peaceful provincial backwaters, gradually succumb to mayhem and violence. Mr. Stewart brings his yearlong diary to a conclusion with a thrilling shoot\u2019em-up, an Alamo-like last stand in Nasiriya, where Sadrist forces attack coalition offices with mortars. It\u2019s a sad end to a story that begins with at least a glimmer of hope and a heap of good intentions. \nMr. Stewart, after attending a ceremony in June 2004 handing over governing power to the Iraqis, is approached by a leader of the mortar attack, a friend as it happens, who thanks him for his good work and tells him how much he will be missed. \u201cWhat are you talking about, Asad \u2014 why were you firing mortars and trying to kill me five weeks ago?\u201d Mr. Stewart asks. The man grins. \u201cAh, Sayyed Rory,\u201d he says, \u201cthat was nothing personal.\u201d",

    "text": "In Epoch of Man, Earth Takes a Beating\n2006-03-16T05:00:00.000Z\nField Notes From a Catastrophe Man, Nature and Climate Change By Elizabeth Kolbert 210 pages. Bloomsbury. $22.95.\n\"The whole world is going too fast,\" an Inuit hunter from Banks Island in the Northwest Territories in Canada told the journalist Elizabeth Kolbert at a bar during a global-warming symposium. A few years before, he and his neighbors had started seeing robins, birds they had no name for. At first the milder weather that drew the robins north seemed a good thing -- \"warmer winters, you know,\" he said -- but as other changes occurred that affected their traditional way of life, including hunting, it did not seem so good. \"Our children may not have a future,\" the hunter concluded. \"I mean, all young people, put it that way. It's not just happening in the Arctic. It's going to happen all over the world.\"\nFor \"Field Notes From a Catastrophe,\" Ms. Kolbert went not exactly all over the world to find out what's happening with global warming but to a great many places in it, and she often heard the same elegiac expressions of foreboding, loss and fear for the next generation. In Shishmaref, Alaska, she met people who were abandoning their tiny island home because, with less sea ice around it as a buffer against storms, their houses and land were being carried away. (\"It makes me feel lonely,\" one woman said of the forced move.) In Iceland, a man monitoring glacial advance and retreat passed on the prediction that by the end of the next century, his country, where glaciers have existed for more than two million years, will be essentially ice-free. On the Greenland ice cap, well away from the coast, researchers gathering meteorological data were surprised to see melt \"in areas where liquid water had not been seen for hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years.\"\nAnd so it went in Fairbanks; Yorkshire; Eugene, Ore. \"Such is the impact of global warming,\" Ms. Kolbert points out, that she could have gone to countless other places, \"from Siberia to the Austrian Alps to the Great Barrier Reef to the South African fynbos -- to document its effects.\"\nMs. Kolbert, a former reporter for The New York Times, doesn't doubt that human-induced global warming is real and will likely have dire consequences; the title of her book includes the word \"catastrophe.\" The pages are replete with bad news: perennial sea ice, which 25 years ago covered an area of the Arctic the size of the continental United States, has since lost an area \"the size of New York, Georgia and Texas combined.\" Carbon dioxide levels, if emissions go unchecked, could reach three times pre-industrial levels by the end of the century.\nBased on a series of articles that appeared in The New Yorker magazine, the book is organized around notes Ms. Kolbert took on \"field trips,\" not only to places where climate change is affecting the natural world but also to ones -- labs, offices, observatories -- where humans are trying to understand the phenomenon of human-induced global warming. Hers is the latest in a large crop of books on the subject -- she notes that \"entire books have been written just on the history of efforts to draw attention to the problem\" -- and there are inevitably some places where other authors have trod before.\nIn language that is clear, if somewhat dry, she examines the major pieces of the story, shedding light on some insider concepts of climatologists, like \"dangerous anthropogenic interference,\" as she goes. The book may make a good handbook; it is both comprehensive and succinct. (If you have ever wondered how a climate model is put together, that's in there, too.)\nShe visits the Netherlands, where rising sea levels caused by global warming are expected to swallow up large parts of the country. In areas where there are already periodic floods, a construction firm has started building amphibious homes (they resemble toasters, Ms. Kolbert says) as well as \"buoyant roads.\" Another field trip took her to Washington, where she was treated to double-speak by an under secretary charged with explaining the administration's position on climate change. \"Astonishingly,\" she comments in a rare show of heat, \"standing in the way\" of progress seems to be President Bush's goal. Not only did he reject the Kyoto Protocol, she notes, with its mandatory curbs on emissions, almost killing the treaty in the process, but he also continues to block meaningful follow-up changes to it.\nThe United States is the largest emitter of carbon in the world, accounting for a quarter of the world's total, with the average American putting out 12,000 pounds of carbon a year, or about 100 times what the average Bangladeshi does. In two decades, the Chinese will surpass Americans in this disheartening achievement, unless they can somehow be persuaded to build their many projected new coal plants using modern, low-emission -- and expensive -- technology.\nSome of the most downbeat (or realistic) observers are climate scientists. \"It may be that we're not going to solve global warming,\" Marty Hoffert, a physics professor at New York University, told Ms. Kolbert, \"the earth is going to become an ecological disaster, and, you know, somebody will visit in a few hundred million years and find there were some intelligent beings who lived here for a while, but they just couldn't handle the transition from being hunter-gatherers to high technology.\"\nMr. Hoffert isn't giving up in despair, though, but turning to high technology for help. He's trying to find carbon-free sources of energy -- away from earth. Satellites with photovoltaic arrays could be launched into space, he suggests. Solar collectors could be placed on the moon. Turbines suspended in the jet stream could generate wind power. At least in the long term, \"I think we have a shot,\" he says.\nIn a final chapter on the \"Anthropocene,\" a newly minted term meaning the geological epoch defined by man, Ms. Kolbert turns from her mostly unbiased field reporting to give her own opinion. She is not optimistic, in large part because it appears that Anthropocene man can't be counted on to do the right thing. \"It may seem impossible to imagine that a technologically advanced society could choose, in essence, to destroy itself,\" she writes, \"but that is what we are now in the process of doing.\"\nBOOKS OF THE TIMES Mariana Gosnell is the author of \"Ice: The Nature, the History and the Uses of an Astonishing Substance,\" recently published by Knopf.",

    "text": "A graying specter in Shanghai - Asia - Pacific - International Herald Tribune\n2006-06-28T05:00:00.000Z\nSHANGHAI \u2014 Shanghai is rightfully known as a fast-moving, hypermodern city full of youth and vigor. But that obscures a less well-known fact: Shanghai has the oldest population in China, and it is getting older in a hurry.\nTwenty percent of this city's population of 13.6 million is over 59, the official retirement age in Shanghai, and retirees are easily the fastest growing segment of the population, with 100,000 new seniors added to the rolls each year. By 2020, about a third of Shanghai's residents will be over 59, remaking the city's social fabric and placing huge new strains on its economy and finances.\nThe changes go far beyond Shanghai, however. Experts say the rapidly graying city is leading one of the greatest demographic changes in history, one with profound implications for the entire country.\nChina, which has built its economic strength on the basis of seemingly endless supplies of cheap labor, could soon face manpower shortages. An aging population may also damage the credibility of the Communist government, which manufactured this historic shift with its one-child policy.\nIntroduced a generation ago, the birth control policy, strongly enforced in urban areas, has spared the country an estimated 390 million births, but may ultimately prove to be a monumental mistake. With China's breathtaking rise toward affluence, most people live longer and have fewer children, mirroring trends seen around the world. But the extraordinarily low birth rate has created a stark imbalance between young and old.\nThat imbalance threatens the country's pension system, which already runs large deficits even with the four- to-one ratio of workers to retirees for which it was intended. Demographers also expect strains on the household registration system, which restricts internal migration.\nThe system prevents young workers from migrating to urban areas to relieve labor shortages, but officials fear that abolishing it could release a flood of humanity that would swamp the cities and depopulate the countryside. As workers become scarcer and more expensive in the increasingly affluent cities along the eastern seaboard, China will face growing economic pressures to move out of assembly work and other labor-intensive manufacturing, which will be taken up by poorer economies in Asia and beyond, and into industries based more on services and information.\n\"For the last two decades, China has enjoyed the advantage of having a high ratio of working age people in the population, but that situation is about to change,\" said Zuo Xuejin, vice president of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. \"With the working age population decreasing, our labor costs will become less competitive, and industries in places like Vietnam and Bangladesh will start becoming more attractive.\"\nIndia, the world's other emerging giant, also stands to benefit, with low wages and a far younger population than China's. Even within China, Zuo said, many foreign investors have begun moving factories away from Shanghai and other eastern cities to inland locations where the work force is both cheaper and younger.\nAs remote as many of these problems may seem today in Shanghai, the country's most prosperous city, evidence of the changes is already on display. If Shanghai represents the future of China, it is in Jing'an, a central Shanghai district where roughly 4,000 people, or 30 percent of the residents, are above 60, where one can glimpse that future.\nSquads of lightly trained social workers monitor the city's elderly, paying regular house visits to combat isolation and assuring that medical problems are attended to. At 10 a.m. on a recent spring morning, Chen Meijuan walked up a narrow and rickety wooden stairway to the second-floor apartment where Liang Yunyu has lived for the past 58 years.\n\"Good morning, granny,\" she called out as she entered the 100-year-old woman's small bedroom, which is filled with old wooden furniture and wall hangings with calligraphy honoring her centenary. \"Did you have a good night's sleep?\"\nChen, 49, earns about $95 a month as one of the 15 agents who are responsible for monitoring the neighborhood's elderly. Her caseload includes more than 200 seniors. \"I usually pay visits to about five or six households a day, stay a little while and chat with them,\" Chen said. \"For Grandma Liang I am a little more focused, visiting two or three times a week. I can basically handle all the people I'm responsible for, even though you feel a bit overwhelmed at the beginning.\"\nAfter being introduced to a foreign visitor, Liang regales her guests with stories, and they range across the decades of the 20th century. She recounts the arrival of Japanese invaders in the city nearly 70 years ago, her opening of a kindergarten in 1958 and her husband's arrest and death in a labor camp during the Cultural Revolution 40 years ago.\n\"My daughter always invites me to live with her family, but I feel embarrassed to be with them,\" Liang said, pausing from her tales. \"I'm worried I might die in her home, so I prefer staying where I am.\"\nHer son, Zha Yuheng, a 76-year-old grandfather and retired textile industry worker, lives with her now, which also concerns her, she says.\n\"I am taken good care of here, but living with my son leaves him with a big burden, I'm afraid,\" she said.\nZha protested that his mother is little trouble at all. \"Every morning I get water for her and make sure it is not too hot or too cold, and she handles everything else on her own,\" he said. \"She gets up, dresses, makes the beds and even makes food for herself.\"\nIn many wealthy societies, the very old are candidates for nursing home care. That sector is still tiny in China, though, especially compared to the size of the elderly population.\nZhang Minsheng opened the city's first private nursing home in 1998, a rambling, 350-bed affair in an industrial area far from central Shanghai that is now 95 percent occupied.\n\"People were not willing to enter nursing homes in the past because they were considered places for those without descendants,\" Zhang said. \"Now, from the standpoint of ordinary people, it is becoming a normal thing.\"\nThe average age of the residents of Zhang's home is 85, and most live several to a room, sleeping on narrow beds separated by flimsy partitions. Many pass the daytime hours in long corridors furnished with chairs, where they chat or simply stare into the distance.\nThe sheer magnitude of the aging phenomenon has Chinese officials and academics grasping for answers, but almost everyone agrees there are no easy fixes. Population experts speak of \"patching one hole and exploding another.\"\nChina has a patchwork of retirement ages, ranging generally from 50 to 60. Raising the retirement age would relieve pressures on the pension system but make it harder for young people to find jobs and would be resented by many of the elderly, most of whom have missed out on China's economic boom.\nLifting restrictions on internal migration raises the unwelcome prospect of a mass migration, while abandoning the one-child policy would be politically unpalatable. And the government has already tinkered with that policy. It now allows husbands and wives who are themselves only children to have a second child, for example, and has eliminated a four-year waiting period between births for those eligible to have a second child.\nBut Chinese demographic experts say that the leadership would resist more radical measures, because it is loath to acknowledge that one of the most ambitious social experiments of the 20th century, one conceived and carried out by the ruling Communist Party, was in any way a failure. Moreover, lifting child-bearing restrictions might not help.\nPoorer people in the interior might have more children, but the rising middle class probably will not, experts say.\n\"More births would only change the structure of the population and prolong the aging process\" of society as a whole, said Ren Yuan, a professor at the Population Research Center of Fudan University, in Shanghai. \"But it has nothing to do with the number of old people.\n\"The scale of this large group has already become a reality. The beds you've got to add in nursing homes, the labor you need to take care of the old, is a reality that can't be changed.\"",

    "text": "After the tsunami, hope gives way to anger - Asia - Pacific - International Herald Tribune\n2006-07-26T05:00:00.000Z\nMASJID, Indonesia \u2014 For a moment, the villagers in this seaside community glimpsed a vision of a splendid future: houses with shady verandas, a new elementary school and an end to the squalid barracks that had been their world since the Asian tsunami swept all before it 19 months ago.\nBut the houses, built with untreated, rickety wood by the aid agency Save the Children, turned out to be uninhabitable - some of them were thrown up in three days, the villagers said. The foundations of the school remain abandoned, overgrown with weeds.\n\"People are mad,\" said Innu Barkar, the village leader, as he walked around the empty houses, some of them relegated for use as chicken yards. \"The aid workers gave promises, but they don't turn out to be reality.\"\nLife in Aceh, the northernmost province of Indonesia where 170,000 people perished in the December 2004 tsunami, has resumed a semblance of normality.\nFor the most part, children are in school, roads are being rebuilt, outdoor markets are packed with local produce, employment is not too hard to find, and even the peace accord between the national government and separatist guerrillas is sticking.\nAlmost everyone has been moved out of muddy tents, though many families still live in dilapidated barracks.\nBut beneath the activity, a veil of disenchantment with international aid agencies pervades, a feeling that extravagant promises backed by unprecedented donations, large and small, from the around the world have yet to be fulfilled.\nTo many, the $8.5 billion that humanitarian agencies, foreign governments and Indonesia say they will spend on the rebuilding of Aceh seems a mirage. In some ways, they are right. So far, the World Bank says only $1.5 billion of the $8.5 billion dedicated to the disaster has been disbursed.\nMore than that, much of what has been spent has not been spent well. A scathing report issued July 14 by the Tsunami Evaluation Coalition, including experts from Western governments, the United Nations and international aid agencies, and endorsed by former President Bill Clinton, makes clear the villagers are not just grumbling.\nMany of the hundreds of aid agencies that poured into Aceh in the aftermath of the tsunami displayed \"arrogance and ignorance,\" and were often staffed by \"incompetent workers\" who came and went quickly, the report said.\nAlthough the billions of dollars in donations translated into a record $7,100 for each affected person - compared to $3 for each survivor of the 2004 floods in Bangladesh - the people of Aceh had not seen the fruits of the generosity, the report added.\nThe assessment, which Clinton noted in a foreword contained \"uncomfortable reading,\" criticized the aid agencies for paying more attention to advertising their \"brands\" and releasing self- laudatory reports than accounting for their expenditures.\nThe agencies had performed relatively well during the first three months after the tsunami, when they delivered food and water, and kept diseases at bay. But much of that success was thanks largely to local organizations, the report said.\nFor the longer-term reconstruction, the report said that lack of expertise by the agencies had resulted in \"shoddy results.\"\nHouse building is in fact the main source of complaint. In some areas, clusters of new housing, their corrugated iron roofs glinting in the tropical sun, have sprouted in the barren landscape. In others, row upon row of dilapidated barracks, swollen with families squatting in tiny rooms, attest to the slow going in building new family dwellings.\nIn all, about 25,000 new houses, constructed by a wide variety of agencies, have been completed out of a projected 120,000 that are needed, according to the UN agency Habitat.\nThere were many reasons why expectations fell short, said Kuntoro Mangkusubroto, director of the Indonesian rehabilitation and reconstruction agency.\nFlush with donations from the public as never before, the aid agencies felt compelled to press ahead with building houses even though they lacked experience.\n\"They said: 'Let's build.' They don't talk about contracts, there are no agreements with contractors. It's build houses: 'Boom, boom, boom,'\" Kuntoro said.\nHe had warned the agencies, he said: \"I kept telling them that the type of people they had, the way they managed, had to change. It took until the end of last December to convince them to change.\"\nAs for the disappointments in Masjid, Save the Children said it would demolish 371 unusable houses it had built here and elsewhere, and would repair 200 others.\nThe agency, which suspended its construction programs in order to investigate what went wrong, has ordered pre- cut houses from Canada.\nStarting in September, it plans to train villagers on how to assemble them, the director of communications, Mike Kiernan, said. Three housing inspectors had been fired from the agency for failing to do their jobs, he said.\nSimilarly, the aid agency Oxfam fired 10 staff on grounds of gross misconduct after uncovering collusion between its staff and Indonesian contractors that resulted in shoddy houses, the director of Oxfam in Aceh, Ian Small, said.\nThere were other problems as well, some of them peculiar to Aceh. One of the big stumbling blocks for many of the aid agencies, for instance, has been the supply of wood, the most common material in local housing.\nThe province of Aceh, a great storehouse of timber with some of the most valuable forests in Indonesia, is one of the most over-logged places in the country. So in a move to preserve the endangered forests, the Indonesian rehabilitation and reconstruction agency that oversees the rebuilding of Aceh issued a ruling that basically prohibited the use of wood from Aceh.\nThe scramble to find enough wood for 20,000 one-room temporary houses became an enduring saga over many continents for Kevin Duignan, a building contractor from New Zealand who came to Aceh to head the housing efforts of the International Federation of the Red Cross.\nTo build the houses, he issued families do-it-yourself kits with tools and steel frames bought in Bangkok. But to get the wood planks for the walls, the Red Cross had to sign up with a British timber firm to supply Baltic pine bought in Scandinavia.\nIt was milled in Britain, then shipped via Singapore to Medan, the Indonesian port just south of Aceh, Duignan said.\nThere were other hitches as well. Concerned about potential health problems associated with anti-termite treatment used on the wood, the Red Cross headquarters in Geneva took two months to sign the contract.\nOften the three-week journey by ship from Britain to Singapore took much longer. Then delivering the wood planks over Aceh's bad roads took time.\nBy mid-July, only 8,900 of the planned 20,000 temporary houses that were supposed to be up months before were finished, Duignan said.\nOne of the occupants of the tiny new homes, Cut Darnita, had decorated her interior with vases of fabric roses and orchids, a cheery red rug, and a coffee table draped with a white linen cloth.\nThe five-member family lay mats on the floor to sleep at night. \"It's small but nice,\" she said of the room, 21 square meters, or 226 square feet. When would she get a permanent home? Darnita shrugged.\nNot all the news is bad. Of the lucky ones with a roof over their heads, those with houses built by the Turkish Red Crescent Society are the most pleased.\n\"They've given us good quality,\" said Khairuman, a building laborer, and his wife, Suginah, as they showed off their blue-tiled bathroom replete with bath and shower in the beach side community of Lampuuk.\nThe Red Crescent Society paid $10,000 for each brick house, about double the cost of houses built by other agencies. And it sent a team of engineers with experience from the 1999 earthquake in Turkey.\n\"The people of Aceh suffered, they need to stay in good houses,\" said an engineer, Ali Pekoz. From the sun-proof window glass to imported hinges on the doors, the Turks chose the best fittings, he said.\nThe harsh analysis by Clinton's evaluation group has prompted some introspection among the major aid agencies. The criticisms come as some in Aceh, and others in Washington, argue that more experienced private contractors or national armies should take on future reconstruction efforts in disaster areas.\nBut the humanitarian agencies reject that idea, saying they bring a special dimension to the work that is implied in their very name.\n\"I suppose we all could have given the billions raised for the effort to the Halliburtons of this world and perhaps the job would be done by now,\" Small of Oxfam said in a recent speech, referring to the U.S. contractor involved in Iraq.\n\"But would that build a fairer, more accountable and equitable society where the poor are not left behind for the lack of a voice and where women are empowered to affect change, and society as a whole has built up the capacity to go forward on its own?\"",

    "text": "Aid Groups Are Criticized Over Tsunami Reconstruction\n2006-07-27T05:00:00.000Z\nMASJID, Indonesia - For a moment, the villagers in this seaside community glimpsed a vision of a splendid future: houses with shady verandas, a new elementary school and an end to the squalid barracks that had been their world since the Asian tsunami swept all before it 19 months ago.\nBut the houses, built with untreated, rickety wood by the aid agency Save the Children, turned out to be uninhabitable -- some of them were thrown together in three days and nights, the villagers said. The foundations of the school remain abandoned, overgrown with weeds.\n\"People are mad,\" said Innu A. Barkar, the village head, as he walked around the empty houses, some of them relegated for use as chicken yards. \"The aid workers gave promises, but they don't turn out to be reality.\"\nLife in Aceh, the northernmost province of Indonesia where 170,000 people perished in the December 2004 tsunami, has resumed a semblance of normality.\nFor the most part, children are in school, roads are being rebuilt, outdoor markets are packed with local produce, employment is not too hard to find, and even the peace accord between the national government and separatist guerrillas is sticking. Almost everyone has been moved out of muddy tents, though many families still live in dilapidated barracks.\nBut beneath the activity, a veil of disenchantment with international aid agencies pervades, a feeling that extravagant promises backed by unprecedented donations, large and small, from the around the world have yet to materialize.\nTo many, the $8.5 billion that humanitarian agencies, foreign governments and Indonesia say they will spend on the rebuilding of Aceh seems a mirage. In some ways, they are right. So far, the World Bank says only $1.5 billion of the $8.5 billion dedicated to the disaster has yet been disbursed.\nMore than that, much of what has been spent has not been spent well. A scathing report issued in mid-July by experts from governments, the United Nations and international aid agencies, and endorsed by former President Bill Clinton, makes clear that the villagers are not just grumbling.\nMany of the hundreds of aid agencies that poured into Aceh in the aftermath of the tsunami displayed \"arrogance and ignorance\" and were often staffed by \"incompetent workers\" who came and went quickly, the report said.\nAlthough the billions of dollars in donations translated into a record $7,100 for each affected person -- compared with $3 for each survivor of the 2004 floods in Bangladesh -- the people of Aceh have not seen the fruits of the generosity, the report added.\nThe assessment, which Mr. Clinton noted in a foreword contained \"uncomfortable reading,\" rapped the aid agencies for paying more attention to advertising their \"brands\" and releasing self-laudatory reports than accounting for their expenditures.\nThe agencies performed relatively well during the first three months after the tsunami when they delivered food and water, and kept diseases at bay. Much of that success was \"thanks largely to local inputs,\" the report said.\nFor the longer term reconstruction, the report said that lack of expertise by the agencies had led to \"shoddy results.\"\nHouse building is in fact the main source of complaint. In some areas, clusters of new houses, their corrugated iron roofs glinting in the tropical sun, have sprouted in the barren landscape. In others, row upon row of dilapidated barracks, swollen with families squatting in tiny rooms, attest to the slow going in building new family dwellings.\nIn all, about 25,000 houses, constructed by a wide variety of agencies, have been completed out of a projected 120,000 that are needed, according to the United Nations agency Habitat.\nThere were many reasons the rebuilding has fallen short, said Kuntoro Mangkusubroto, director of the Indonesian rehabilitation and reconstruction agency.\nFlush with donations from the public as never before, the aid agencies felt compelled to press ahead with building houses even though they lacked experience.\n\"They said, 'Let's build,' \" Mr. Kuntoro explained. \"They don't talk about contracts; there are no agreements with contractors. It's build houses, boom, boom, boom.\"\nHe said he had warned the agencies. \"I kept telling them that the type of people they had, the way they managed, had to change,\" he said. \"It took until the end of last December to convince them to change.\"\nAs for the disappointments in Masjid, Save the Children said it would demolish 371 unusable houses it had built here and elsewhere, and would repair 200 others.\nThe agency, which suspended its construction programs in order to investigate what went wrong, has ordered prefabricated houses from Canada. Starting in September, it plans to train villagers on how to assemble them, said Mike Kiernan, the group's director of communications.\nThree housing inspectors have been fired from the agency for failing to do their jobs, Mr. Kiernan said.\nSimilarly, Oxfam dismissed 10 staff members on grounds of gross misconduct after uncovering collusion between them and Indonesian contractors that resulted in shoddy houses, said Ian Small, the director of Oxfam in Aceh.\nThere were other problems as well, some peculiar to Aceh. One of the big stumbling blocks, for instance, has been the supply of wood, the most common material in local housing.\nThe province of Aceh, a great storehouse of timber with some of the most valuable forests in Indonesia, is also one of the most over-logged places in the nation. In a move to preserve the endangered forests, the Indonesian rehabilitation and reconstruction agency, which is overseeing the rebuilding, issued a ruling that basically prohibited the use of wood from Aceh.\nThe scramble for enough wood for 20,000 one-room temporary houses became an enduring quest for Kevin Duignan, a building contractor from New Zealand who came to Aceh to head up the housing efforts of the International Federation of the Red Cross.\nTo build the houses, he issued families do-it-yourself kits with tools and steel frames bought in Bangkok. But to get the wood planks for the walls, the Red Cross signed on with a British timber company, which supplied Baltic pine bought in Scandinavia.\nConcerned about potential health problems associated with the wood's antitermite treatment, the Red Cross headquarters in Geneva took two months to approve the contract.\nFinally, the wood was milled in Britain, and then shipped via Singapore to Medan, the Indonesian port just south of Aceh, Mr. Duignan said.\nBut often the journey by ship from Britain to Singapore took much longer than the three weeks it was supposed to take, and delivering the wood over Aceh's rotten roads ate up still more time.\nBy mid-July, just 8,900 of the planned 20,000 temporary houses that were supposed to be up months ago were finished, Mr. Duignan said.\nOne of the occupants of the tiny new homes, Cut Darnita, decorated her interior with vases of fabric roses and orchids, a cheery red rug and a coffee table draped with a white linen cloth. The five-member family lay down mats on the floor to sleep at night.\n\"It's small but nice,\" she said of the room, about 226 square feet. When would she get a permanent home? Ms. Darnita shrugged.\nNot all the news is bad. Work on a highway down the devastated west coast of the province, financed by the United States government, is under way, and a new port has opened in Meulaboh, the seaside town that was smashed to smithereens.\nOf the lucky ones with a roof over their heads, those with houses built by the Turkish RedCrescent Society are the most pleased.\n\"They've given us good quality,\" said Khairuman, 45, a building laborer, and his wife, Suginah, 43, as they showed off their blue-tiled bathroom replete with bath and shower in the beachside community of Lampuuk. Like many Indonesians, they use one name.\nThe Red Crescent Society paid $10,000 for each brick house, about double the cost of houses built by other agencies. And it sent a team of engineers with experience from the 1999 earthquake in Turkey.\n\"The people of Aceh suffered; they need to stay in good houses,\" said an engineer, Ali Pekoz. From the sunproof window glass to imported hinges on the doors, the Turks chose the best fittings, he said.\nThe harsh analysis by Mr. Clinton's evaluation group has prompted some introspection among the major aid agencies. The criticisms come as some argue here in Aceh, and in Washington, that more experienced private contractors or national armies should take on future reconstruction efforts in disaster areas.\nBut the humanitarian agencies reject that idea, saying they bring a special dimension to the work that is implied in their very name.\n\"I suppose we all could have given the billions raised for the effort to the Halliburtons of this world, and perhaps the job would be done by now,\" Mr. Small of Oxfam said in a recent speech. \"But would that build a fairer, more accountable and equitable society where the poor are not left behind for the lack of a voice and where women are empowered to effect change, and society as a whole has built up the capacity to go forward on its own?\"",

It is now 95 percent occupied.\n\"People were not willing to enter nursing homes in the past, because they were considered places for those without descendants,\" Mr. Zhang said. \"Now, from the standpoint of ordinary people, it is becoming a normal thing.\"\nThe average age of the residents of Mr. Zhang's home is 85, and most live several to a room, sleeping on narrow beds separated by flimsy partitions. Many pass the daytime hours in long corridors furnished with chairs, where they chat or simply stare into the distance.\nThe sheer magnitude of the aging phenomenon has Chinese officials and academics grasping for answers, but almost everyone agrees that there are no easy fixes. Population experts here speak of \"patching one hole and exploding another.\"\nChina has a wide range of retirement ages, generally from 50 to 60. Raising the retirement age would relieve pressures on the pension system but make it harder for young people to find jobs. And it would be resented by many elderly people, most of whom have missed out on China's economic boom.\nLifting restrictions on internal migration raises the unwelcome prospect of a mass migration, while abandoning the one-child policy would be politically unpalatable.\nThe government has already tinkered with the policy. It now allows husbands and wives who were their parents' only children to have a second child, for example, and has eliminated a four-year waiting period between births for those eligible to have a second child.\nBut Chinese demographic experts say the leadership is unlikely to abolish the one-child rule, because it is reluctant to admit that one of its signature policies was in any way a failure - particularly in view of the disastrous population boom encouraged by Mao in the 1950's.\nMoreover, lifting child-bearing restrictions might not help. Poorer people in the interior might have more children, but the rising middle class probably will not, experts say.\n\"More births would only change the structure of the population and prolong the aging process\" of the society as a whole, said Ren Yuan, a professor at the Population Research Center of Fudan University in Shanghai. \"But it has nothing to do with the number of old people. The scale of this large group has already become a reality. The beds you've got to add in nursing homes, the labor you need to take care of the old, is a reality than can't be changed.\"",

    "text": "As Foreign Investment Rises, India Addresses Security Concerns\n2006-08-24T05:00:00.000Z\nBANGALORE, India, Aug. 21 - As foreign investors blanket the country, India is preparing with a ramp-up of its own: an expansion of its security laws to thwart possible threats from rapid globalization.\nAmid perhaps overly sensitive concerns that some foreign investments might step into areas of national security, the government is drafting legislation to block overseas companies from doing business in India if they are perceived as security risks.\n\"As investors flood vital sectors such as telecommunications, media, airlines and ports, our priority is to bring in comprehensive safeguards,\" said Kamal Nath, minister of commerce and industry. He added, \"The intention is not to curb entry of overseas capital but to ensure that money from undesirable origins does not enter critical sectors.\"\nAmid the unprecedented momentum of foreign investment, top officials from various ministries, including Mr. Nath's own, held their first meeting earlier this month to discuss security risks. While legislation is likely within the year, the government has asked the Foreign Investment Promotion Board and state-owned firms to screen out investments seen as potential threats.\nThe legislation being completed by the National Security Council, and even the temporary measures, are expected to have a wide-ranging impact on foreign direct investment, mergers and acquisitions, and even on overseas participation in tenders by government-owned departments and firms.\n\"The government is arming itself to intervene over and beyond current investment policy,\" said Alok Shende, director of the information communication technology practice at the consultancy firm Frost & Sullivan, who predicts delays and a rash of accusations over unfair use.\nUntil a few years ago, foreign investments were limited to minority stakes, so security issues were manageable as ownership and management control remained with Indians. But that has changed drastically, Mr. Shende said.\nForeign investments in the country's fiscal year, which ended in March, totaled $5.7 billion. According to official projections, overseas direct investment is expected to touch $10 billion in the current year. A chunk of this investment can still flow in easily, particularly for minority stakes or certain approved industries.\nUnlike the United States or Europe, India does not have a formal framework for overseeing security concerns in economic decisions. \"Because of the rise of terrorism, security clampdowns are intruding on decision-making in most democracies in the world,\" said Dr. V. S. Arunachalam, a robotics expert at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and a former military adviser to the Indian government.\nAlready, there are signs that security concerns have made politicians uneasy about recent economic decisions. For instance, last month Communist parties objected to the appointment of Papa Stefanou Yanni, a Greek chief operating officer, to the newly privatized Delhi International Airport. They argued that a foreigner should not be allowed to manage operations at an airport where high-security flights carrying the president and the prime minister land and take off.\nDeciding whether foreign investments conflict with national security interests will be tricky. The consortium that won the bid to manage the Delhi airport -- consisting of Indian, German and Malaysian companies -- said the tender required the presence of an experienced foreign partner. The German partner, Fraport, had in turn brought in the chief operating officer from abroad. \"He has managed 20 airports in his career and it is just incidental that such an industry veteran is of Greek origin,\" said Arun Arora, a spokesman for the Delhi International Airport.\nThe proposal for a new law was first made shortly after terrorist bombings in July ripped through the main commuter train system in Mumbai, the country's financial hub. In the last couple of months, the Indian government has experienced an increase in threats, from baleful e-mail messages to the president to bomb hoaxes at various cities' airports and offices. Additionally, investigating agencies said they had found links between the Mumbai terror attacks and terror cells they say may be operating in neighboring Pakistan and Bangladesh through mobile and Internet networks.\nSo in critical areas like telecommunications, officials in different ministries agree that strict screening of investors has become important, particularly because the government last year raised the ceiling for foreign investments in telecom to 74 percent, from 49 percent. It still requires foreign investments over 49 percent, however, to be submitted for government approval. The government is considering a test case right now, Hutchison Essar, a joint venture between the Indian conglomerate Essar Group and Hutchison International, a telecom company controlled by Li Ka Shing of Hong Kong that has a strong presence in emerging markets. Last year, Hutchison International sold a 19.3 percent stake to Orascom Telecom of Egypt, which gave Orascom a 12 percent holding and the right to nominate a director on Hutchison Essar's board.\nEssar wrote to the Indian government seeking to clarify whether such a share transfer, which the companies considered rather indirect, required prior government approval. Orascom, it said, operates networks in a number of countries including Pakistan. \"As a major shareholder, we cannot let an unknown entity surreptitiously come into the joint venture,\" said Vikash Saraf, chief executive of the Indian partner, Essar Teleholdings.\nThe government has yet to respond, Mr. Saraf said, though investment rules clearly require regulators to ban investments from \"unfriendly\" countries. Mr. Nath, the minister, said the government was still examining how changes in the shareholding structure could have an impact on the management of Indian firms like Hutchison Essar.\nEven before the Mumbai train bombings, government intelligence agencies had sought stricter scrutiny of the licensing for importing of telecommunication equipment. India is the world's fastest-growing telecom market, and the world's largest equipment makers -- Motorola, Nokia, Ericsson and Chinese companies like Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corporation -- are lining up to corner market share.\nThe Foreign Investment Promotion Board turned a cold shoulder to an application in March 2005 by Huawei Technologies, one of China's largest electronics equipment makers, to get a trading license for its India unit. The government has also snubbed the company's application for setting up a manufacturing base in India and expanding its existing research and development facility in Bangalore. Local newspapers reported that India's security agencies were concerned about the company's past links to China's military establishment.\nA spokesman for Huawei Technologies, who declined to be named because he did not have authorization from his headquarters to speak publicly, said the company was at a \"competitive disadvantage\" but maintained that the proposed national security law was unlikely to have any further impact on its status.\nHistorically, India has had a troubled relationship with its northern neighbors Pakistan and China.\nIn another recent case, after months of agonizing, India's cabinet in July denied security clearance to three Chinese firms trying to bid for container terminal projects at Mumbai and Madras, also known as Chennai, in India's recently privatized port sector. The companies included Hutchison Port Holdings, which operates the Karachi international container terminal in Pakistan.\nMeanwhile, such curbs may permeate other areas as well. For instance, the government will soon mandate that an expert panel of scientists and intellectual property specialists scan all foreign investment in research and development in rapidly expanding areas like drugs, where India is emerging as a global hub. Companies, mainly from the United States, have invested more than $1 billion in research operations in the country, and investments totaling more than three times that are in the pipeline.\nAlongside all this, the government is anxious to dispel any impressions that the security law is unfriendly to investors. Mr. Shende, the analyst, said the government did not wish to discourage much-needed foreign investment in sectors like infrastructure.

    "text": "Report Warns Malnutrition Begins in Cradle\n2006-03-03T05:00:00.000Z\nNutrition education programs for parents would do a better job than large and politically popular feeding programs in fighting the rampant malnutrition that is stunting the development of more than 100 million children worldwide, a new World Bank report says, finding that a lack of food is usually not the main cause of child malnutrition.\nChildren are irreversibly damaged by malnutrition by age 2, long before they begin primary school. The World Bank report contends that aid efforts must concentrate on the brief window of opportunity before that age. And in areas not hit by famine or other crises, the report says, efforts must focus more on teaching mothers to properly feed and care for babies and toddlers than on school meal programs.\nWhile experts interviewed yesterday generally agreed with the bank's assessment of the evidence on malnutrition, some of them argued that feeding programs did have an important role to play in improving the nutrition of children.\nThe debate about how to tackle the problem is an important one at a time when the world is pushing to reduce child mortality by two-thirds over the coming decade. Malnutrition is implicated in more than half of the deaths of children globally, \"a proportion unmatched by an infectious disease since the Black Death,\" the bank's report says.\nThe World Bank, as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development is popularly known, is the largest financier of antipoverty programs in developing countries. Its report, titled \"Repositioning Nutrition as Central to Development,\" maintains that countries like India with staggering rates of malnutrition need to change their approach to speed up progress.\nOutside of regions in crises, nutritionists at the bank say, programs should shift their emphasis from directly providing food to changing the behaviors of mothers -- for example, to breast-feed exclusively for the first six months of life or seek quick treatment for their children's diarrhea. Improvements to sanitation and health care are also needed.\nThe origins of malnutrition often lie in the way infants and young children are fed, not the quantity of food available.\nIn many societies in Africa and South Asia, the first days of thick, yellowish breast milk, called colostrum, are discarded, though it contains antimicrobials that can protect children against infection. It is then replaced with local concoctions that all too often include bad water that can give children diarrhea. For school-age children, nutrition education, iron supplements and deworming medicines are usually better investments for improving nutrition than providing meals, the report says. It acknowledges that feeding programs increase school attendance, but emphasizes that they should not come at the expense of efforts to reach preschool children.\n\"You get more bang for your buck without the food,\" said Meera Shekar, the lead author of the report, who described feeding programs as costly and vulnerable to corruption. \"The food brings in votes for politicians. We have very little evidence it improves nutrition.\"\nAdvocates of feeding programs reply that food can be a magnet that draws mothers and children to centers where nutrition counseling is offered -- and that food itself can provide pregnant women and children under 2 with a richer, more varied diet, while attracting older children to school and helping them concentrate on learning.\n\"If you feed the children well, they'll all be there,\" said Jean Dreze, an economist and leading advocate of free lunch programs in India, which now serve more than 100 million primary-school students. \"The response to food is phenomenal.\"\nSome of the facts about malnutrition, familiar to experts but not widely understood, seem counterintuitive. For example, rates of malnutrition in South Asia, including India, Bangladesh and Nepal, are nearly double those in sub-Saharan Africa, which is much poorer.\nIndia's programs to feed children in school have multiplied in recent years, but its nutrition program for preschool children mainly assists those between the ages of 3 to 6 -- too late to prevent the stunting and damage to intellect that occur by age 2, bank nutritionists and other experts say.\nA spokesman for the Indian Embassy in Washington said yesterday that he had not yet read the report and could not comment on it.\nThe problem of malnutrition in India, known for its well-educated, high-tech workers, is striking. Almost half the children are stunted by malnutrition, but the problem is not limited to the poor. A quarter of the children under age 5 in the richest fifth of the population are also underweight and nearly two-thirds are anemic, the report says.\n\"Think of the power of India if all these kids were not malnourished and could participate fully,\" Ms. Shekar said.\nNutritionists say the implications of the large body of research that informs the bank's report is clear: countries must intervene before children turn 2.\n\"If you miss that period, the damage is irreversible, especially in cognition, but also in growth,\" said Marie Ruel, director of the division of food consumption and nutrition at the International Food Policy Research Institute.",

Its findings were supported in interviews with current and former workers.\nSuch complaints have dogged the apparel industry for years, even as it has adopted measures intended to improve working conditions in factories that produce clothing for American and European consumers.\nThe abusive conditions that the guest workers described show how hard it is to control sweatshops as factories spring up in new places, often without effective monitoring.\nIn recent years, Jordan has become a magnet for apparel manufacturers, helped by the privileged trade position the United States has given it, first because of its 1994 peace accord with Israel and then because of a free trade agreement signed with Washington in 2001.\nJordan's apparel industry, whose exports to the United States last year amounted to $1.2 billion, employs tens of thousands of guest workers, mainly from Bangladesh and China.\nIn interviews this week, Bangladeshis who used to work in Jordanian apparel factories and several who still do, had similar tales - of paying more than $1,000 to work in Jordan, of working 90 to 120 hours a week, of not being paid the overtime guaranteed by Jordanian law, of sleeping 10 or 20 to a small dorm room.\nThe National Labor Committee helped arrange interviews with the Bangladeshi workers.\nThe largest retailer in the United States, Wal-Mart, and one of its largest clothing makers, Jones Apparel, confirmed Tuesday that they had discovered serious problems with conditions at several major Jordanian factories.\nIn addition, a factory monitor for a major American company confirmed that Jordanian factories routinely confiscated their guest workers' passports, doctored wage and hour records and coached employees to lie to government and company inspectors about working conditions. The monitor asked not to be identified because the company had not given authorization to speak publicly.\nBeth Keck, a spokeswoman for Wal- Mart, said the company did not own or manage factories but tried to improve working conditions in Jordan and elsewhere.\n\"It is a continuous challenge, not just for Wal-Mart but for any company,\" she said, noting that the most commonly observed problems included failure to pay proper wages, \"egregious hours,\" and \"use of false or insufficient books or documentation.\"\nCharles Kernaghan, executive director of the National Labor Committee, which has exposed mistreatment in factories in Central America and China, said he was shocked by what he discovered in Jordan.\n\"These are the worst conditions I've ever seen,\" he said. \"You have people working 48 hours straight. You have workers who were stripped of their passports, who don't have ID cards that allow them to go out on the street. If they're stopped, they can be imprisoned or deported, so they're trapped, often held under conditions of involuntary servitude.\"\nKernaghan said Bangladeshi workers had contacted his organization to complain about working conditions in Jordan.\nHe then traveled to Jordan and met quietly with dozens of workers. He said American companies, despite their monitoring efforts, were often slow to uncover workplace abuses because workers were coached to lie to them or were scared to speak out. Also, factories often send work out to substandard subcontractors without notifying American retailers.\nSeveral factory owners in Jordan insisted that they treated their workers properly.\n\"Some people are always making allegations,\" said Karim Saifi, the owner of United Garment Manufacturing, a factory near Amman that workers criticized for long hours and wage violations.\n\"As far as we know,\" he said, \"we follow all the labor laws here. If we were not abiding by all of the local Jordan laws, we would not be able to operate.\"\nTwo large industrial zones outside Amman are thriving, having geared themselves to the American apparel market.\n\"It would be wrong to think that problems at a few places are representative of the 102 apparel factories in my country,\" said Yanal Beasha, Jordan's trade representative in Washington.\nJordan's ambassador to the United States, Karim Kawar, said, \"If there are any violations of our labor laws, we certainly take it seriously.\"\nBeasha said Jordanian government inspectors monitor the working conditions of factories. He said the Jordanian government cared about the welfare of foreign guest workers, asserting that it enforced overtime laws.\nMohammed Saiful Islam, 30, a Bangladeshi who was production manager at Western Garment, said in New York this week that several times the workers had to work until 4 a.m., then sleep on the factory's floor for a few hours before resuming work at 8 a.m.\n\"The workers got so exhausted they became sick,\" he said. \"They could hardly stay awake at their machines.\"\nSaiful, who is in the United States to highlight poor working conditions in Jordan, pointed to a yellow and black fleece that he said his factory made. It had an Athletic Works label made for Wal-Mart, selling for $9.48.\n\"Sometimes when companies sent in monitors, the workers were instructed what to say,\" Saiful said.\nMohamed Irfan, who by telephone from Jordan said he was Western's owner, said, \"The workers get the minimum wage, and all times, there is no problem in our factory.\"",

But the abusive conditions that the guest workers described show how hard it is to control sweatshops as factories spring up in new places, often without effective monitoring in place.\nIn recent years, Jordan has become a magnet for apparel manufacturers, helped by the privileged trade position that the United States has given it, first because of its 1994 peace accord with Israel and then because of a free trade agreement signed with Washington in 2001.\nJordan's apparel industry, which exported $1.2 billion to the United States last year, employs tens of thousands of guest workers, mainly from Bangladesh and China.\nIn interviews this week, five Bangladeshis who used to work in Jordanian apparel factories and four who still do had similar tales of paying more than $1,000 to work in Jordan, of working 90 to 120 hours a week, of not being paid the overtime guaranteed by Jordanian law, of sleeping 10 or 20 to a small dorm room. The National Labor Committee helped arrange interviews with the Bangladeshi workers, who spoke through interpreters.\nThe largest retailer in the United States, Wal-Mart, and one of the largest clothing makers, Jones Apparel, confirmed yesterday that they had discovered serious problems with the conditions at several major Jordanian factories.\nIn addition, a factory monitor for a major American company confirmed that Jordanian factories routinely confiscated their guest workers' passports, doctored wage and hour records and coached employees to lie to government and company inspectors about working conditions. The monitor asked not to be identified because the company had not given authorization to speak publicly.\nBeth Keck, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart, said the company did not own or manage factories, but tried to improve working conditions in Jordan and elsewhere. \"It is a continuous challenge, not just for Wal-Mart but for any company,\" she said, noting that the most commonly observed problems included failure to pay proper wages, \"egregious hours,\" and \"use of false or insufficient books or documentation.\"\nCharles Kernaghan, executive director of the National Labor Committee, which has exposed mistreatment in factories in Central America and China, said he was shocked by what he discovered in Jordan.\n\"These are the worst conditions I've ever seen,\" he said. \"You have people working 48 hours straight. You have workers who were stripped of their passports, who don't have ID cards that allow them to go out on the street. If they're stopped, they can be imprisoned or deported, so they're trapped, often held under conditions of involuntary servitude.\"\nMr. Kernaghan said Bangladeshi workers had contacted his organization to complain about working conditions in Jordan. He then traveled to Jordan and met quietly with dozens of workers. He said American companies, despite their monitoring efforts, were often slow to uncover workplace abuses because workers were coached to lie to them or were scared to speak out. Moreover, factories often send work out to substandard subcontractors without notifying American retailers.\nSeveral factory owners in Jordan insisted that they treated their workers properly.\n\"Some people are always making allegations,\" said Karim Saifi, the owner of United Garment Manufacturing, a factory near Amman that workers criticized for long hours and wage violations. \"As far as we know, we follow all the labor laws here. If we were not abiding by all of the local Jordan laws, we would not be able to operate.\"\nSeveral foreign apparel workers said that while their factories required them to stay until midnight, the Jordanian workers were usually allowed to leave at 4 p.m.\nTwo large industrial zones outside Amman are thriving, having geared themselves to the American apparel market. They have attracted dozens of garment manufacturers, some with 200 workers, some with 2,000, that say they produce clothes for J. C. Penney, Sears, Wal-Mart, Gap and Target.\n\"It would be wrong to think that problems at a few places are representative of the 102 apparel factories in my country,\" said Yanal Beasha, Jordan's trade representative in Washington.\nJordan's ambassador to the United States, Karim Kawar, said \"If there are any violations of our labor laws, we certainly take it seriously.\"\nMr. Beasha said Jordanian government inspectors monitor the working conditions in factories. But several guest workers said factory managers hid abuses by coaching workers to lie. Mr. Beasha said the Jordanian government cared about the welfare of foreign guest workers, noting that it enforced overtime laws and recently increased the minimum wage for citizens and guest workers.\nBut Mohammed Z., who has worked for more than a year at the Paramount Garment Factory, said that even though he worked more than 100 hours a week -- normally from 7 to midnight seven days a week -- the company refused to pay him overtime when he did not meet production targets. He asked that his last name be withheld for fear of retribution.\nHaving paid $2,000 to work in Jordan, he said, in an interview from Amman, \"I'm not earning enough to repay my loan or to support my wife and son.\"\nUnhappy that his passport has been confiscated, he said: \"My identity has been taken by the company. I have no freedom because I have no freedom to move to other places.\"\nMohammed Saiful Islam, 30, a Bangladeshi who was production manager at Western Garment, said that several times the workers had to work until 4 a.m., then sleep on the factory's floor for a few hours, before resuming work at 8 a.m.\n\"The workers got so exhausted they became sick,\" he said. \"They could hardly stay awake at their machines.\"\nMr. Saiful, who is in the United States to highlight poor working conditions in Jordan, pointed to a yellow and black fleece sweatshirt that he said his factory made.

Mr. Kasim and other factory managers said workers received free room and board and sometimes medical care.\nBut several workers said that when they were sick they did not receive medical care, but were instead punished and had their pay docked.\nSeveral Bangladeshis said there were terrible conditions at factories that made clothes for Wal-Mart and Jones Apparel, which owns brands like Gloria Vanderbilt and Jones New York.\nMs. Keck, the Wal-Mart spokeswoman, said company inspectors recently identified \"serious violations\" of its labor rules at three Jordanian factories. At Honorway Apparel Jordan, for example, which manufactures sleepwear for Wal-Mart, inspectors found employees working off the clock, managers who refused to pay overtime and wages that \"could not be verified,\" Ms. Keck said. At the Ivory Garment Factory, which Wal-Mart ceased working with two years ago, inspectors found \"egregious working hours.\"\nJoele Frank, a spokeswoman for Jones Apparel, said the company had also found \"serious problems\" at the Ivory Garment Factory, which produces Gloria Vanderbilt clothing, and said it would \"monitor the situation closely.\" A spokesman for Sears Holding, said the company was investigating potential problems at Honorway, which produces clothes for Kmart, a division of Sears Holding.\nA Kohl's spokeswoman denied workers' accusations that clothing sold by the company was made at several Jordanian factories with poor conditions. Target said it worked with only one factory that has come under criticism-- Al Safa Garments, which Wal-Mart recently cited for labor violations.\nMany retailers said their policy was, after discovering violations, to work with a factory to improve conditions, rather than automatically withdraw their business. Wal-Mart says it gives factories a year to fix serious problems, reinspecting them every 120 days.\n\"Our business with the factory is the only leverage we have to push for improvement,\" Ms. Keck said.\nAfter The New York Times asked about the accusations on Monday, Wal-Mart dispatched two inspectors to Jordan.\nHazrat Ali, 25, who worked from September 2004 to March 2005 at the Al Shahaed factory, said he sometimes worked 48 hours in a row and received no pay for the six months.\n\"If we asked for money, they hit us,\" he said.\nNasima Akhter, 30, said that the Western factory gave its workers a half-glass of tea for breakfast and often rice and some rotten chicken for lunch.\n\"In the four months I was in Jordan, they didn't pay us a single penny,\" she said. \"When we asked management for our money and for better food, they were very angry at us. We were put in some sort of jail for four days without anything to eat. And then they forced us to go back to Bangladesh.\"",

    "text": "The Factories of Lost Children\n2006-03-25T05:00:00.000Z\nBethany, Conn. - NINETY-FIVE years ago, March 25 also fell on a Saturday. At 4:40 p.m. on that sunny afternoon in 1911, only minutes before the end of the workday, a fire broke out on the eighth floor of the Asch Building, a block east of Washington Square in Manhattan.\nThe Triangle Waist Company occupied the top three floors of the 10-story building. There, some 600 workers were employed in the manufacture of ladies' shirtwaists, most of them teenage girls who spoke little English and were fresh off the boat from Russia, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Italy. The fire, probably caused by a carelessly tossed match or cigarette butt (there were perhaps 100 men working at the Triangle), engulfed the premises in minutes.\nThe factory owners and the office staff on the 10th floor, all but one, escaped onto the roof and climbed to an adjacent building on Waverly Place. But on the eighth and ninth floors, the workers were trapped by a deadly combination of highly combustible materials, workrooms crowded by dense rows of table-mounted sewing machines, doors that were locked or opened inward, inadequate fire escapes, and the lack of any plan or instruction.\nBefore the first horse-drawn fire engines arrived at the scene, girls -- some holding hands, in twos and threes -- had already begun to jump from the windows. The hundred-foot drop to the cobbled street was not survivable. The firemen deployed their nets, but the force of gravity drove the bodies of the girls straight through to the pavement, and they died on impact.\nThe ladders on the fire trucks were raised quickly, but the New York City Fire Department of 1911 was not equipped to combat fires above six stories -- the limit of those ladders. The top floors of the Asch Building, a neo-Renaissance \"fireproof\" warehouse completed in 1901 in full compliance with building codes, burned relentlessly.\nThe workers trapped near the windows on the eighth and ninth floors made the fast and probably instinctive choice to jump instead of burning or suffocating in the smoke. The corpses of the jumpers, by some estimates as many as 70, could at least be identified. But the bodies of most of those who died inside the Triangle Waist Company -- trapped by the machinery, piled up on the wrong side of doors, heaped in the stairwells and elevator shafts -- were hideously charred, many beyond recognition.\nBefore 15 minutes had elapsed, some 140 workers had burned, fallen from the collapsing fire escapes, or jumped to their deaths. Several more, critically injured, died in the days that followed, putting the official death toll at 146.\nBut what happened to the children who were working at the Triangle Waist Company that afternoon?\nBy most contemporary accounts, it was common knowledge that children were usually on the premises. They were hidden from the occasional inspectors, but underage girls, as young as 9 or 10, worked in most New York garment factories, sewing buttons and trimming threads. Where were they on this particular Saturday afternoon?\nThere are no descriptions of children surviving the fire. Various lists of those who died 95 years ago today -- 140 named victims plus six who were never identified (were some of those charred remains children?) -- include one 11-year-old, two 14-year-olds, three 15-year-olds, 16 16- year-olds, and 14 17-year-olds. Were the ages of workers, living and dead, modified to finesse the habitual violation of child labor laws in 1911? How many children actually died that day? We will never know. And now 1911 is almost beyond living memory.\nBut we will also never know how many children were among the dead on May 10, 1993, in Thailand when the factory of the Kader Industrial Toy Company (a supplier to Hasbro and Fisher-Price) went up in flames. Most of the 188 workers who died were described as teenage girls.\nWe will never know with any certainty how many children died on Nov. 25, 2000, in a fire at the Chowdhury Knitwear and Garment factory near Dhaka, Bangladesh (most of the garments made in Bangladesh are contracted by American retailers, including Wal-Mart and the Gap), where at least 10 of the 52 trapped in the flames by locked doors and windows were 10 to 14 years old.\nAnd we will never know how many children died just last month, on Feb. 23, in the KTS Composite Textile factory fire in Chittagong, Bangladesh. The official death toll has climbed into the 50's, but other sources report that at least 84 workers lost their lives. It's a familiar story: crowded and unsafe conditions, locked exits, hundreds of undocumented female workers as young as 12, a deadly fire. There may never be another tragic factory fire in America that takes the lives of children. We don't lock them into sweatshops any more. There are child labor laws, fire codes.\nBut as long as we don't question the source of the inexpensive clothing we wear, as long as we don't wonder about the children in those third world factories who make the inexpensive toys we buy for our own children, those fires will occur and young girls and boys will continue to die. They won't die because of natural catastrophes like monsoons and earthquakes; they will die because it has become our national habit to outsource, and these days we outsource our tragedies, too.\nOp-Ed Contributor Katharine Weber is the author of the forthcoming novel \"Triangle.\"",

But Gvosdev uses a sleight of hand to make his case.\nRegarding Iraq, it's safe to say that no serious Democratic candidate would have rushed to war. Arguments over failed intelligence have obscured an important policy difference. Neoconservatives were advocating war with Iraq even before Bush won the presidency in 2000 and were public about their distrust of UN inspectors. But despite neocon suspicions, we now know that the inspection regime effectively ended Saddam Hussein's illegal weapons programs. Democrats would have been more likely to pursue the sort of multilateral arrangements that we now know were effective.\nEven before Sept. 11, the White House aggravated our allies by refusing to cooperate on issues important to them. It walked away from the Kyoto environmental treaty. It later asserted a first- strike option with tactical nuclear weapons. These and other examples alienated other nations.\nSo Gvosdev is right that Democrats can't snap their fingers and induce other nations to cooperate with us. To do so would be impossible in the current climate. But a greater emphasis on soft power and multilaterism consistently applied over time would yield substantially different results.\n<i> Michael Phelps, San Pedro, California </i>\n<b> Crowding the planet</b>\nJohn Tierney is quite right to dismiss the population doomsayers (\"The overpopulation myths,\" Views, Oct. 17). There is more than enough food for everyone in the world today and for the foreseeable future.\nThere are 850 million chronically hungry people in the world today and the numbers are growing by more than four million a year. This is simply unacceptable. We need to build a food-first policy in official development assistance in recognition of the fact that we cannot eradicate poverty without first addressing the problem of hunger.\n<i> Neil Gallagher, Rome, Director of communications The United Nations World Food Program</i>\nIf John Tierney wants to convince us of the fallacy of global warming then he should present scientific facts and not tie his argument with the past myths of overpopulation.\nThe picture accompanying Tierney's article shows a typical scene of an overcrowded train in my native Bangladesh. Thanks to our huge population, we are able to constantly promote the fact that we have an abundance of cheap labor. But is that all foreign investors want?\nWith the highest population density in the world, Bangladesh faces enormous challenges in clothing, housing and providing jobs for our people.\nDoes Tierney have any idea how we can employ 150 million people within 130,000 square kilometers?\nGlobal warming is melting the polar- ice caps, leading to rising sea levels, which will cause much of Bangladesh's coastline to disappear in the next 30 years.\nWhat will happen then? Since Tierney has no problems with more people filling the planet, maybe we should just get on boats and head for New York City. Will the United States Coast Guard welcome us with open arms? I very much doubt it.\nI take his point in not exaggerating the problem, but people like Al Gore, whom he calls a popular prophet, are only trying to highlight the reality. And environmentalists like Gore are not anticapitalist. Tierney must realize there is big money to be made in the green sector.\n<i> Zubair Latif, Hong Kong</i>\nRegarding Roger Cohen's \"Still- youthful America sails past a milestone\" (Globalist, Oct. 18): Let's hope that the America Cohen sees as welcoming change will stop sacrificing American and foreign lives in futile wars. Let's hope that America's ever greater ethnic and racial mix of people will direct its energies outward to help make life better for everyone, regardless of where they were born.\n<i> Elliot Silberberg, Milan</i>\nGiven the exponential growth of air travel and its impact on air pollution and climate change, it was dispiriting to read that the excesses of the super-rich increasingly include ownership of Boeing 787 Dreamliners and other massive aircrafts for personal use (\"For the super-rich, upgrading means a 787,\" Oct. 18).\nThe use of massive planes carrying just a few people and spewing tons of hazardous waste into the atmosphere, with no regard for anything but their owners' perceived importance, is self- absorbed arrogance on a sickening scale. It's hardly an inspiration for the rest of us.\n<i> Carina Pico Martinez, Hong Kong</i>",

    "text": "Out to Maximize Social Gains, Not Profit\n2006-12-09T05:00:00.000Z\nIt was March 2005 and Muhammad Yunus, the microcredit pioneer who recently won the Nobel Peace Prize, had just agreed -- over a handshake during lunch at a Paris restaurant -- to start a \"social business\" with the head of Groupe Danone, the French food company.\nMr. Yunus's Grameen Bank and Danone would recoup only their original investment and a 1 percent profit, reinvesting the rest into the enterprise. But unsure that his new partner, Franck Riboud, Danone's chief executive, completely comprehended the unusual concept, Mr. Yunus dashed an e-mail message from the car to spell out what they had discussed and asking for a confirmation.\n\"I still couldn't believe he understood what I said, because his English is not very good and my English is not very good, either,\" Mr. Yunus recalled during a recent visit to New York. \"So, I said we should put it on record and a few minutes later I got the confirmation.\"\nLast month, Grameen Danone, as the new company is named, opened the first of what are to be 50 fortified-yogurt plants in Bangladesh. Zin\u00e9dine Zidane, the French soccer star who is an \"ambassador\" for Danone's programs for children, attended the opening and drew frenzied media attention to the venture.\nOver the last year and a half, officials from Danone and Grameen met in Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital, under Mr. Yunus's direction to plan the business to suit the needs and challenges of the country, said Laurent Sacchi, senior vice president at Danone, who sits on the joint venture's board.\nFor instance, upon Mr. Yunus's insistence, the company agreed to build 50 small, labor-intensive plants rather than one large and highly automated one as it does in the rest of the world, so more workers and suppliers would benefit from it.\nAs Mr. Yunus accepts the Nobel Peace Prize tomorrow, the anecdote serves as an example of his persistent and tireless efforts on behalf of the poor. Mr. Yunus, a former professor of economics, met recently with reporters and editors of The New York Times. Following are excerpts:\nQ. Microcredit has been in operation in Bangladesh, India and many other places for some years, yet poverty remains entrenched in these countries. What are the most fundamental barriers to alleviating poverty in your mind?\nA. My position has been that poverty has not been created by the poor people. The system has created them. The system being institutions, the concepts or framework of living. That's where the seed of poverty is. Either we pluck them out so that poverty disappears or if this is so involved that you cannot pick them out, you have to create an institution which is free from this virus.\nSo we go step by step, concept by concept and institution by institution. We picked one institution that is banking. There may be something wrong there that we can fix. So we created another kind of banking -- banking which doesn't depend on collateral.\nThat's what my interest is. I'm not stopping at what I'm saying is microcredit. I'm saying information technology is a very important thing. And there are other issues.\nQ. Can you talk a little about the relative merits of nonprofit microcredit versus it as a business model and whether that is more sustainable, perhaps?\nA. First of all, I'm not in favor of nonprofit things. These are charities. I'm not involved in that. I don't particularly get excited about it. I'm talking about the business part of it where you do things so that you get your money back.\nAnd there you have a distinction between two kinds: one, to make personal gain out of it. The other one, the way we run the business, for the results we want to produce in people. So one is a profit-maximizing business. The other is a social business. I'm on the social business side of it. If somebody wants to run it as a profit-maximizing business, welcome. This is competition. My mission is to get the person out of poverty rather than how much money I'm making out of it.\nQ. Is there any way for you to know, or to guess, how much difference your company has made? What would your country be like without it?\nA. One way to look at what we have done is to look within our families, the seven million families that we have worked with. We monitor it every day, every year, to see how many of them have gotten out of poverty, how many of them are coming close to getting out of poverty. We have 10 indicators. If a family fulfills all the 10 indicators, then we declare that the family has gone out of poverty.\nFifty-eight percent of the borrowers of Grameen Bank who have been with Grameen Bank for five years or more have gone out of poverty, according to these 10 indicators. The indicators are: How is the roof? Is it a solid roof? Can it protect from the rain? Do they have a sanitary latrine? Do you have a mosquito net? A blanket for the winter with warm clothing is another. Do they have enough savings in the bank account? Access to pure, safe drinking water? Are all children attending a school?\nStudies after studies show that income level is rising, people are getting out of poverty. A World Bank study done in the mid-90s shows their conclusion is that 5 percent of Grameen borrowers get out of poverty every year. Also, 100 percent of the children of Grameen families are in school, 100 percent. And many of them are in high schools, now in universities, medical schools, engineering schools.\nQ. Do you track the children of the women whom you have financed through the bank, how far do girls go in school or how well they do professionally?\nA. So far as primary education is concerned, 100 percent stay in family education. We have no problem. Now this is also true for the whole country. Our worry in Bangladesh was exactly your worry, that girls will be dropping out, mothers or fathers will keep them home and boys will go out. Secondary education presents a very interesting case in Bangladesh. Girls outnumber boys.\nWe give scholarships. This is grant money from the bank. We give nearly 30,000 scholarships per year. The scholarship policy is very straightforward. Fifty percent of the scholarships are reserved for girls so that they don't have to compete with the boys. The remaining 50 percent is open to both boys and girls. As a result, about 63 to 67 percent of the students who got the scholarships are girls.\nOur interest is to bring them to higher education. In higher education, girls' participation is still very low. Although it's a 100 percent guaranteed student loan, but that's where parents get into the dilemma of getting them married. So they don't want to push them into the higher education. We are encouraging them.\nQ. In some countries, there's been a problem that education has created more graduates of colleges than in fact the economy needs.\nA. This is a problem. Occasionally I go around and my colleagues go around and meet with these students, not their parents. These are bright young people. It's not easy to get into higher education in Bangladesh and India. It's highly competitive. And the seats are limited. So unless your performance is way above, you can't get in.\nAnd the question finally comes: You helped us a lot, Grameen Bank is something that we see as our family. But we always wonder, when we finish our education, where are we going to get the jobs. Will you help us to find the jobs? This is a question I cannot avoid.\nI came up with my kind of response to that and I'm trying to build this thing up. My response is: \"Yes, I understand your position, but I have a different view. As Grameen Bank children, you should have your own position, own pledge about your life. And the pledge you make, you repeat every morning: I shall never ask for a job from anybody. I will create jobs.\"\nThey get shocked. They say, I'm asking for a job. He says I will create jobs? How am I going to do that? Some say we don't know how to create a job. I said, if you don't know, if you don't find an answer, you look at your mother, what she has done. She didn't apply for a job. Even if she applied for a job, she will never get a job. She's an illiterate person.\nShe borrowed from Grameen Bank. That's why you are here. And as a child she helped you to go to school, maintained you and brought you all the way. You are becoming a doctor, you are becoming an engineer. See what she did? You know it much better than I do. If an illiterate woman can create her job, what good is your education if you cannot do better than your mother?\nMoney is not your problem. And, as an executive of the bank, I'm guaranteeing you, whatever money you need, we have the money.",

    "text": "Out to Maximize Social Gains, Not Profit\n2006-12-07T06:03:00.000Z\nIt was March 2005 and Muhammad Yunus, the micro credit pioneer who recently won the Nobel Peace Prize, and the head of Group Danone, the French food company, had just agreed \u2014 over a handshake during lunch at a Paris restaurant \u2014 to start a \u201csocial business.\u201d\nMr. Yunus\u2019s Grameen Bank and Danone would only recoup their original investment and a one percent profit, reinvesting the rest into the enterprise. But unsure that his new partner, Franck Riboud, Danone\u2019s chief executive, completely comprehended the unusual concept, Mr. Yunus dashed an e-mail from the car to spell out what they had discussed and asking for a confirmation.\n\u201cI still couldn\u2019t believe he understood what I said, because his English is not very good and my English is not very good, either,\u201d Mr. Yunus recalled during a recent visit to New York. \u201cSo, I said we should put it on record and a few minutes later I got the confirmation.\u201d\nLast month, Grameen Danone, as the new company is named, opened the first of what are to be 50 fortified-yogurt plants in Bangladesh. Zin\u00e9dine Zidane, the French soccer star who is an \u201cambassador\u201d for Danone\u2019s programs for children, attended the opening and drew frenzied media attention to the venture.\nOver the last year and a half, officials from Danone and Grameen met in Dhaka, Bangladesh\u2019s capital, under Mr. Yunus direction to plan the business to suit the needs and challenges of the South Asian country, said Laurent Sacchi, senior vice president at Danone who sits on the joint venture\u2019s board. For instance, upon Mr. Yunus\u2019s insistence the company agreed to build 50 small, labor-intensive plants rather than one large and highly automated facility as it does in the rest of the world, so more workers and suppliers would benefit from it.\nAs Mr. Yunus accepts the Nobel Peace Prize today, the anecdote serves as an example of the former economics professor\u2019s persistent and tireless efforts on behalf of the poor. He recently met with reporters and editors of The New York Times; an excerpt of that question and answer session follows.\nQ. Micro credit has been in operation in Bangladesh, India and many other places for some years, yet poverty remains entrenched in these countries. What are the most fundamental barriers to alleviating poverty in your mind?\nA. My position has been that poverty has not been created by the poor people. The system has created them. The system being institutions, the concepts or framework of living. \nThat\u2019s where the seed of poverty is. Either we pluck them out so that poverty disappears or if this is so involved that you cannot pick them out, you have to create an institution which is free from this virus.\nSo we go step by step, concept by concept and institution by institution. We picked one institution that is banking. There may be something wrong there that we can fix. So we created another kind of banking \u2014 banking which doesn\u2019t depend on collateral.\nThat\u2019s what my interest is. I\u2019m not stopping at what I\u2019m saying is micro credit. I\u2019m saying information technology is very important thing. And there are other issues.\nQ. Can you talk a little about the relative merits of non-profit micro credit versus it as a business model and whether that is more sustainable, perhaps?\nA. First of all, I\u2019m not in favor of non-profit things. These are charities. I\u2019m not involved in that. I don\u2019t particularly get excited about it. I\u2019m talking about the business part of it where you do things so that you get your money back.\nAnd there you have a distinction between two kinds: one, to make personal gain out of it. The other one, the way we run the business, for the results we want to produce in people. So one is a profit-maximizing business. The other is a social business. I\u2019m on the social business side of it. If somebody wants to run it as a profit-maximizing business, welcome. This is competition. My mission is to get the person out of poverty rather than how much money I\u2019m making out of it. \nQ. Is there any way for you to know, or to guess, how much difference your company has made? What would your country be like without it? \nA. One way to look at what we have done is to look within our families, the 7 million families that we have worked with. We monitor it every day, every year, to see how many of them have gotten out of poverty, how many of them are coming close to getting out of poverty. We have 10 indicators. If a family fulfills all the 10 indicators, then we declare that the family has gone out of poverty.\nFifty-eight percent of the borrowers of Grameen Bank who have been with Grameen Bank for five years or more have gone out of poverty, according to these 10 indicators. The indicators are: How is the roof? Is it a solid roof? Can it protect from the rain? Do they have a sanitary latrine? Do you have a mosquito net? A blanket for the winter with warm clothing is another. Do they have enough savings in the bank account? Access to pure, safe drinking water? Are all children attending a school. \nStudies after studies show that income level is rising, people are getting out of poverty. A World Bank study done in mid-90\u2019s show their conclusion is that 5 percent of Grameen borrowers get out of poverty every year. Also, 100 percent of the children of Grameen families are in school, 100 percent. And many of them are in high schools, now in universities, medical schools, engineering schools. \nQ. Do you track the children of the women who you have financed through the bank, how far do girls go in school or how well they do professionally? \nA. So far as primary education is concerned, 100 percent stay in family education. We have no problem. Now this is also true for the whole country. Our worry in Bangladesh was exactly your worry, that girls will be dropping out, mothers or fathers will keep them home and boys will go out. Secondary education presents a very interesting case in Bangladesh. Girls outnumber boys.\nWe give scholarships. This is grant money from the bank. We give nearly 30,000 scholarships per year. The scholarship policy is very straightforward. Fifty percent of the scholarships are reserved for girls so that they don\u2019t have to compete with the boys. The remaining 50 percent is open to both boys and girls. As a result, about 63 to 67 percent of the students who got the scholarships are girls.\nOur interest is to bring them to the higher education. In higher education, girls\u2019 participation is still very low. Although it\u2019s 100 percent guaranteed student loan, but that\u2019s where parents get into the dilemma of getting them married. So they don\u2019t want to push them into the higher education. We are encouraging them.\nQ. In some countries, there\u2019s been a problem that education has created more graduates of colleges than in fact the economy needs. \nA. This is a problem. Occasionally I go around and my colleagues go around and meet with these students, not their parents. These are bright young people. It\u2019s not easy to get into higher education in Bangladesh and India. It\u2019s highly competitive. And the seats are limited. So unless your performance is way above, you can\u2019t get in.\nAnd the question finally comes: You helped us a lot, Grameen Bank is something that we see as our family. But we always wonder, when we finish our education, where are we going to get the jobs. Will you help us to find the jobs? This is a question I cannot avoid.\nI came up with my kind of response to that and I\u2019m trying to build this thing up. My response is: \u201cYes, I understand your position, but I have a different view. As Grameen Bank children, you should have your own position, own pledge about your life. And the pledge you make, you repeat every morning: I shall never ask for a job from anybody. I will create jobs.\u201d\nThey get shocked. They say, I\u2019m asking for a job. He says I will create jobs? How am I going to do that? Some say we don\u2019t know how to create a job. I said, if you don\u2019t know, if you don\u2019t find an answer, you look at your mother, what she has done. She didn\u2019t apply for a job. Even if she applied for a job, she will never get a job. She\u2019s an illiterate person.\nShe borrowed from Grameen Bank. That\u2019s why you are here. And as a child she helped you to go to school, maintained you and brought you all the way.

At that rate, officials said, the world will not meet the United Nations target of halving the number of undernourished children by 2015. \n\"This is unbelievably slow progress and far less than what is needed to meet the goals,\" Rainer Gross, chief of nutrition for the agency, said in a telephone briefing from New York. \"We are far off course.\" \nHealth experts estimate that malnutrition contributes to more than half of the 11 million deaths of children under 5 every year. The report focused mainly on children under 5 who are underweight.\nChina has surpassed the United Nations goal for 2015, halving its percentage of underweight children and reducing the death rate for children under 5 by more than one-third, the report shows.\nIn India, on the other hand, the share of children who are undernourished dropped by only six percentage points since 1990, leaving a staggering 47 percent of children under 5 underweight. India, Bangladesh and Pakistan account for half of the world's underweight children, the report stated.\n\"South Asia is the worst-performing region,\" Dr. Gross said. \"Children in this region are living in an almost constant state of emergency.\"\nIn southern and eastern Africa, nearly 30 percent of children are underweight, just as in 1990, according to the report. Officials blamed the AIDS pandemic, increasing poverty and declines in agricultural productivity, among other factors. \nDr. Gross said the main cause of malnutrition was not food shortages, but poor diets with too few vitamins and minerals.\nAt a news conference here, Jay Naidoo, chairman of the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition, proposed that the staples of poor families' diets, like corn or wheat flour, be routinely fortified with vitamins to improve nutrition, just as salt is iodized to limit iodine deficiencies. \n\"The most cost-effective intervention is to fortify the basic foods that people consume,\" he said.

    "text": "Lack of Food Not Main Cause of Child Malnutrition, Study Says\n2006-03-02T05:00:00.000Z\nRampant child malnutrition in poor countries is usually not caused principally by lack of food, nor are large, politically popular programs to feed schoolchildren the right way to tackle a problem stunting the intellectual and physical development of more than 100 million children worldwide, a new World Bank report says.\nThe irreversible damage malnutrition causes to children occurs by age 2, long before they begin primary school, and the bank contends that efforts to combat this scourge must concentrate on the brief window of opportunity between gestation and age 2, with a focus on teaching mothers to properly feed and care for babies and toddlers.\nWhile many experts would agree with the bank's assessment of the evidence on malnutrition, its policy recommendations are sure to be controversial at a time when the world is pushing to halve poverty in the coming decade and school feeding programs are often seen as part of the solution.\nThe bank, the largest financier of antipoverty programs in developing countries, maintains in the report released today, \"Repositioning Nutrition as Central to Development,\" that countries like India with staggering rates of malnutrition need to change their approach to speed up progress.\nNutritionists at the bank say programs should emphasize changing the behaviors of mothers A\u0302\u0097 for example, to breastfeed exclusively for the first six months of life or seek quick treatment for their children's diarrhea and other common childhood illnesses, rather than directly providing food.\nProviding school-aged children with nutrition education, iron supplements and deworming medicines are better ways to improve nutrition than simply providing them with meals, the report also says.\nThe lead author of the report, Meera Shekar, said feeding programs are costly and vulnerable to corruption, with publicly provided food too easily given to better-off people rather than to the poor, or siphoned off to be sold.\n\"You get more bang for your buck without the food,\" she said. \"The food brings in votes for politicians. We have very little evidence it improves nutrition.\"\nAdvocates of feeding programs reply that food can be a magnet that draws mothers and children to centers where nutrition counseling is offered and that nutritious food provided early enough in life can also help.\n\"If you feed the children well, they'll all be there,\" said Jean Dreze, an economist and leading advocate of free school lunch programs in India who conceded that effects of such early feeding programs on nutrition can be difficult to capture statistically. \"The response to food is phenomenal.\"\nSome of the facts about malnutrition, familiar to experts but not widely understood, seem counterintuitive. For example, rates of malnutrition in South Asia A\u0302\u0097 including India, Bangladesh and Nepal A\u0302\u0097 are nearly double those in sub-Saharan Africa, which is much poorer.\nIn fact, in India, where almost half the children are stunted by malnutrition, the problem is far from limited to the poor. A quarter of the children under age 5 in the richest fifth of the population are underweight and more than half of them are anemic.",

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.\n \u2605SLATER BRADLEY An energetic jump-cut sequence in the opening frames of a work in Slater Bradley\u2019s exhibition of six new, contemplative videos lingers briefly over headstones at P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, among them the one marking the grave of the pioneer French filmmaker Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s. Perhaps it is coincidence, but several of the videos on display at Team Gallery refer to cinema. In \u201cThe Abandonments\u201d (2005-6) a young man dressed as a dandy tap dances in the rain with an umbrella, an imitation of Gene Kelly in \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain.\u201d In \u201cUncharted Settlements II\u201d (2005), shot at a \u201cStar Wars\u201d convention at the Indiana Convention Center in Indianapolis, the camera follows someone dressed as a storm trooper mingling with devoted fans, also dressed as their favorite \u201cStar Wars\u201d characters. But the most adventurous cinematic reference is to Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d the inspiration behind \u201cDark Night of the Soul\u201d (2005-6). The video tracks a figure in a space suit, above, wandering through the exotic scenery of the American Museum of Natural History after hours, to the poetic sound of a flute. The chic, odd camera angles suggest detachment, making the suited figure seem as if he were visiting some strange, remote world. (Slater Bradley, \u201cThe Abandonments,\u201d through Dec. 23 at Team Gallery, 83 Grand Street, near Greene Street, SoHo, 212-279-9219, teamgallery.com.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO\nMuseums\n \u2605 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: \u2018GOLD,\u2019 through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100. (Roberta Smith)\n  \n BROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018WATERCOLORS BY WALTON FORD,\u2019 through Jan. 28. This show assembles more than 50 of Mr. Ford\u2019s large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora, produced since the early \u201990s. They frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images you merely sense that some horrible violence has occurred, or is about to happen. The moralizing of these images can become a little tedious. But this artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. 200 Eastern Parkway at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000. (Benjamin Genocchio)\n \u2605 SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018SPANISH PAINTING FROM EL GRECO TO PICASSO,\u2019 through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Vel\u00e1zquezes and Zurbar\u00e1ns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dal\u00eds and Picassos, many famous, many not. The big point is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman) \n \u2605 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920S,\u2019 through Feb. 19. This show\u2019s 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic\u2019s porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) \n \u2605 THE MET: \u2018LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL \u2014 AN ARTIST\u2019S COUNTRY ESTATE,\u2019 through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound \u2014 and of the Tiffany residences preceding it \u2014 is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany\u2019s genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)\n \u2605 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: \u201cSAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,\u201d through March 4. A cartoonist-artist extraordinaire, Saul Steinberg (1914-99) was a veritable Leonardo of graphic drollery. His famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything \u2014 Floridians, linguistic concepts, erotica, cowboys, Cubism, nature, architecture and women \u2014 with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 Steinberg drawings, collages and constructions, arranged in chronological order, goes on, Steinberg\u2019s progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like \u201cFeet on Chair\u201d (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like \u201cStreet War (Cadavre Exquisis)\u201d (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008. (Grace Glueck)\n \u2605 MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: \u2018A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG\u2019S NEW YORK,\u2019 through March 25. A very lively adjunct to the Morgan show, this smaller display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here in one incarnation, looming majestically over humble brownstones; in another, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg\u2019s eyes, could be monuments, too. And no one ever fully appreciated the impact of upscale New York women until Steinberg the misogynist came along. \u201cFur Coats\u201d (1951), portrays four expensive baroque pelts wearing four women, and it\u2019s dead on. You may think you know Steinberg\u2019s work, but these two shows make it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672. (Glueck)\n \u2605 NEUE GALLERY: \u2018JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,\u2019 through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or \u201ctotal work of art,\u201d orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look.

This retrospective of John Latham spans nearly 50 years of Mr. Latham\u2019s work, which is concerned with time, preservation and decay. Among the more idiosyncratic and interesting pieces are a series of \u201cCluster\u201d sculptures from the early 1990s, orbs of plaster embedded with books and suspended from the ceiling, which suggest cultural detritus preserved in celestial rock or geological magma. \u201cThe N-U Niddrie Heart\u201d (around 1990), in which \u201cThe Pregnancy Survival Manual\u201d and \u201cVanished Species\u201d are cut up and fitted into glass armatures, with sand scattered around their bases, explores human production (and reproduction) and the passage of time. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. \n(Martha Schwendener)\n STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: \u2018AFRICA COMICS,\u2019 through March 18. Intense is the word for the stealth-potency of this modest-size, first-time United States survey of original designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense, the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. The entertainment value is high. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids, and the schlumpy but wily character named Goorgoolou from Senegal. But more often than not, humor is sugar-coating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Holland Cotter) \n WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: KIKI SMITH: \u2018A GATHERING, 1980-2005,\u2019 through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float in \u201cKiki Smith\u201d: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum\u2019s black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith\u2019s art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed to its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Cotter)\nGalleries: Uptown\nSIGMAR POLKE Painting is man\u2019s oldest conjuring trick, and Sigmar Polke is one of its reigning magicians. In this show new paintings and those from the 1980s, all two-sided and painted with resin, surround a small selection of German Baroque amber (Bernstein is German for amber) jewelry and exquisite tchotchkes. The show simulates a Wunderkammer, a darkened wonder cabinet of the 17th or 18th century. The paintings, made translucent by the resin, nearly defy deciphering. Doodles and abstract splashes of white paint overlay murky washes of glowing resin on both sides of their membranous support, then cast dim shadows on the wall behind, so that the pictures seem suspended in midair, floating.

(Kimmelman) \nGalleries: Chelsea\n\nARIC OBROSEY Mr. Obrosey\u2019s fastidious graphite depictions of woven and knotted threads have a mesmerizing, meditative quality. Care in the making encourages care in looking. In close-up the motifs combine elements of straightforward trompe l\u2019oeil. Each strand of these lacelike compositions behaves according to strict spatial and structural rules; they may twist and turn, conform or deviate eccentrically. But reality is respected, even when the strands coalesce at the center into a mandalalike circle or a wildly knotted disco ball. And the illusions go deeper: Each strand is something like a world unto itself, with distinct, chainlike structures or decorative patterns that suggest different cultures or other crafts. The strands pulse like arteries of tiny lights in a work dedicated to Felix Gonzalez-Torres. Greater than Mr. Obrosey\u2019s drawing skill is his ability to convert what might be called Conceptual content into visual terms.

It\u2019s a great idea, a chance to linger over shows seen in a rush, or entirely missed, or fondly remembered. The curator, Matthew Higgs, director of White Columns, has made satisfyingly unobvious choices, and any show that includes Klara Liden and Stuart Sherman is a winner.

Each day the man working in the office, or his assistant, arranges objects on his widow sill. The combination and order of the objects represent a specific message, which viewers down on the plaza can interpret using a key-chart on the telescope. 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, corner of Liberty and William Streets; stairway entrance to the plaza is on William Street at Cedar Street; www.publicartfund.org, Jan. 14.

Mr. Jankowsky gets closest to real emotion in the 11-minute \u201cAngels of Revenge,\u201d in which 12 costume contestants at a horror film convention walk slowly toward the camera while reciting their most dire revenge fantasies. A wolf man complains about having his cellphone stolen; a \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d type waves a chain saw; a man in a bloody chef\u2019s suit suggests a found-art Paul McCarthy video. It is hard to decide if the lameness of their efforts indicates that most people aren\u2019t violent, that horror buffs need to get a life, or that Mr. Jankowski\u2019s interventionism is temporarily in a rut.

He took hundreds of pictures with a large-format camera that produced wide, superbly detailed color photographs. Mr. Polidori is a connoisseur of chaos, and the beauty of his pictures \u2014 they have a languid, almost underwater beauty \u2014 entails locating order in bedlam.

It and dozens of other early movie treasures, along with fine art of the period, are shown in this engrossing if learned survey of the links \u2014 both planned and happenstance \u2014 between the earliest movies and other American visual art forms at the turn of the 20th century.

She added unobtrusive touches of color: mostly stripes that waver somewhere between Mondrian and festive war paint, but also circles and dabs, often in response to nail holes or the faded hues from the wood\u2019s earlier life.

At that rate, officials said, the world will not meet the United Nations target of halving the number of undernourished children by 2015.\n\"This is unbelievably slow progress and far less than what is needed to meet the goals,\" Rainer Gross, chief of nutrition for the agency, said in a telephone briefing from New York. \"We are far off course.\"\nHealth experts estimate that malnutrition contributes to more than half of the 11 million deaths of children under 5 every year.

It was one of the clearest confirmations by a government official of the country's nuclear capacity.\nThe foreign minister, Taro Aso, who has called for discussion of Japan's nonnuclear policy, also repeated the official government position that the country's pacifist Constitution, which allows Japan to defend itself, does not forbid possession of a nuclear bomb for defensive purposes.\nJapan, the only country ever attacked by atomic weapons - by the United States in World War II - has for decades maintained a strict policy of not possessing, developing or allowing the introduction of nuclear bombs on its territory.\nJERUSALEM\nThe former chief of Israel's armed forces cut short a visit to New Zealand this week after a warrant was issued for his arrest on suspicion of war crimes against Palestinians, an Israeli newspaper reported on Thursday.\nHaaretz said on its Web site that a New Zealand court issued the warrant against Moshe Yaalon at the request of local human rights groups that wanted him tried for a 2002 Israeli air strike in the Gaza Strip which killed at least 14 civilians.

    "text": "Report Warns Malnutrition Begins in Cradle\n2006-03-03T05:00:00.000Z\nNutrition education programs for parents would do a better job than large and politically popular feeding programs in fighting the rampant malnutrition that is stunting the development of more than 100 million children worldwide, a new World Bank report says, finding that a lack of food is usually not the main cause of child malnutrition.\nChildren are irreversibly damaged by malnutrition by age 2, long before they begin primary school. The World Bank report contends that aid efforts must concentrate on the brief window of opportunity before that age. And in areas not hit by famine or other crises, the report says, efforts must focus more on teaching mothers to properly feed and care for babies and toddlers than on school meal programs.\nWhile experts interviewed yesterday generally agreed with the bank's assessment of the evidence on malnutrition, some of them argued that feeding programs did have an important role to play in improving the nutrition of children.\nThe debate about how to tackle the problem is an important one at a time when the world is pushing to reduce child mortality by two-thirds over the coming decade. Malnutrition is implicated in more than half of the deaths of children globally, \"a proportion unmatched by an infectious disease since the Black Death,\" the bank's report says.\nThe World Bank, as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development is popularly known, is the largest financier of antipoverty programs in developing countries. Its report, titled \"Repositioning Nutrition as Central to Development,\" maintains that countries like India with staggering rates of malnutrition need to change their approach to speed up progress.\nOutside of regions in crises, nutritionists at the bank say, programs should shift their emphasis from directly providing food to changing the behaviors of mothers -- for example, to breast-feed exclusively for the first six months of life or seek quick treatment for their children's diarrhea. Improvements to sanitation and health care are also needed.\nThe origins of malnutrition often lie in the way infants and young children are fed, not the quantity of food available.\nIn many societies in Africa and South Asia, the first days of thick, yellowish breast milk, called colostrum, are discarded, though it contains antimicrobials that can protect children against infection. It is then replaced with local concoctions that all too often include bad water that can give children diarrhea. For school-age children, nutrition education, iron supplements and deworming medicines are usually better investments for improving nutrition than providing meals, the report says. It acknowledges that feeding programs increase school attendance, but emphasizes that they should not come at the expense of efforts to reach preschool children.\n\"You get more bang for your buck without the food,\" said Meera Shekar, the lead author of the report, who described feeding programs as costly and vulnerable to corruption. \"The food brings in votes for politicians. We have very little evidence it improves nutrition.\"\nAdvocates of feeding programs reply that food can be a magnet that draws mothers and children to centers where nutrition counseling is offered -- and that food itself can provide pregnant women and children under 2 with a richer, more varied diet, while attracting older children to school and helping them concentrate on learning.\n\"If you feed the children well, they'll all be there,\" said Jean Dreze, an economist and leading advocate of free lunch programs in India, which now serve more than 100 million primary-school students. \"The response to food is phenomenal.\"\nSome of the facts about malnutrition, familiar to experts but not widely understood, seem counterintuitive. For example, rates of malnutrition in South Asia, including India, Bangladesh and Nepal, are nearly double those in sub-Saharan Africa, which is much poorer.\nIndia's programs to feed children in school have multiplied in recent years, but its nutrition program for preschool children mainly assists those between the ages of 3 to 6 -- too late to prevent the stunting and damage to intellect that occur by age 2, bank nutritionists and other experts say.\nA spokesman for the Indian Embassy in Washington said yesterday that he had not yet read the report and could not comment on it.\nThe problem of malnutrition in India, known for its well-educated, high-tech workers, is striking. Almost half the children are stunted by malnutrition, but the problem is not limited to the poor. A quarter of the children under age 5 in the richest fifth of the population are also underweight and nearly two-thirds are anemic, the report says.\n\"Think of the power of India if all these kids were not malnourished and could participate fully,\" Ms. Shekar said.\nNutritionists say the implications of the large body of research that informs the bank's report is clear: countries must intervene before children turn 2.\n\"If you miss that period, the damage is irreversible, especially in cognition, but also in growth,\" said Marie Ruel, director of the division of food consumption and nutrition at the International Food Policy Research Institute.",

    "text": "Malnutrition begins at home, before age 2, World Bank reports\n2006-03-03T05:00:00.000Z\nNEW YORK \u2014 Nutrition education programs for parents would do a better job than large and politically popular feeding programs in fighting the rampant malnutrition that is stunting the development of more than 100 million children worldwide, a new World Bank report says, asserting that a lack of food is usually not the main cause of child malnutrition.\nChildren are irreversibly damaged by malnutrition by age 2, long before they begin primary school. The World Bank report contends that aid efforts must concentrate on the brief window of opportunity before that age. And in areas not hit by famine or other crises, the report says, efforts must focus more on teaching mothers to properly feed and care for babies and toddlers than on school meal programs.\nWhile experts interviewed Thursday generally agreed with the bank's assessment of the evidence on malnutrition, some of them argued that feeding programs do have an important role to play in improving the nutrition of children.\nMalnutrition is implicated in more than half of children's deaths globally, \"a proportion unmatched by an infectious disease since the Black Death,\" the report says.\nThe World Bank, as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development is popularly known, is the largest financier of antipoverty programs in developing countries. Its report, titled \"Repositioning Nutrition as Central to Development,\" maintains that countries like India, with staggering rates of malnutrition, need to change their approach to speed up progress.\nOutside of regions in crises, nutritionists at the bank say, programs should shift their emphasis from directly providing food to changing the behaviors of mothers - for example, to breast-feed exclusively for the first six months of life or to seek quick treatment for their children's diarrhea. Improvements to sanitation and health care are also needed.\nThe origins of malnutrition often lie in the way infants and young children are fed, not the quantity of food available.\nIn many societies in Africa and South Asia, the first days of thick, yellowish breast milk, called colostrum, are discarded, though it contains antimicrobials that can protect children against infection. It is then replaced with local concoctions that all too often include bad water that can give children diarrhea.\nFor school-age children, nutrition education, iron supplements and deworming medicines are usually better investments for improving nutrition than providing meals, the report says. It acknowledges that feeding programs increase school attendance, but stresses that they should not come at the expense of efforts to reach preschool children.\n\"You get more bang for your buck without the food,\" said Meera Shekar,the lead author of the report, who described feeding programs as costly and vulnerable to corruption.\n\"The food brings in votes for politicians. We have very little evidence it improves nutrition,\" she said.\nAdvocates of feeding programs reply that food can be a magnet that draws mothers and children to centers where nutrition counseling is offered - and that food itself can provide pregnant women and children under 2 with a richer, more varied diet, while attracting older children to school and helping them concentrate on learning.\n\"If you feed the children well, they'll all be there,\" said Jean Dreze, an economist and advocate of free lunch programs in India, which serve more than 100 million primary schoolchildren.\nSome of the facts about malnutrition, familiar to experts but not widely understood, seem counterintuitive. For example, rates of malnutrition in South Asia - including India, Bangladesh and Nepal - are nearly double those in sub- Saharan Africa, which is much poorer.\nIndia's programs to feed children in school have multiplied in recent years, but its nutrition program for preschool children mainly assists those between the ages of 3 to 6 - too late to prevent the stunting and damage to intellect that occur by age 2, bank nutritionists and other experts say.\nThe problem of malnutrition in India, known for its well-educated, high-tech workers, is striking. Almost half the children are stunted by malnutrition, but the problem is not limited to the poor. A quarter of the children under age 5 in the richest fifth of the population are also underweight and nearly two-thirds are anemic, the report says.\nNutritionists say the implications of the large body of research that informs the bank's report is clear: Countries must intervene before children turn 2.\n\"If you miss that period, the damage is irreversible, especially in cognition, but also in growth,\" said Marie Ruel, director of the division of food consumption and nutrition at the International Food Policy Research Institute.",

    "text": "Satisfying a yen for the tastes of home - At Home Abroad - International Herald Tribune\n2006-06-23T05:00:00.000Z\nTOKYO \u2014 The number of Japanese living abroad topped the one million mark for the first time in 2005, according to the Foreign Ministry - up nearly 30 percent from 10 years ago.\nThis means that the world over, more Japanese are in search of the only food that satisfies their innermost desires: Japanese food.\nHappily for them, this is not the grail quest it once was. Typical Japanese dishes like sushi, tempura and yakitori have moved into the mainstream, and Japanese restaurants can be found even in remote corners of the globe.\nYet Japanese expatriates who have grown up on the unique diet of an island nation say they often struggle to find the right kind of Japanese food prepared in the right manner - especially when they don't live in New York, Paris, London or another major city.\nNaoko Anzai, an international aid worker who divides her time among Latvia, Bangladesh and Tokyo, said there were perhaps 20 Japanese restaurants in the Latvian capital, Riga. But when she goes to one of them, she said, her appetite fades away almost instantly.\nThe local cooks might mix sake in the sushi rice, for example, which is not where it is supposed to be. Mismatched food items, in fact, are common complaints among Japanese diners abroad.\nSo are mismatched utensils: Anzai said she had been offered Chinese spoons, which look like small ladles, to eat miso soup. The Japanese sip their soup and use chopsticks to eat the tofu and other solids.\nLatvian sushi, she said, is not handled with the level of delicacy expected of good-quality Japanese sushi: The difference is in the way the rice is cooked and how it is pressed into shape.\nLatvian tempura doesn't taste right either, she said, because \"something is wrong all along the steps in which they prepare and cook it.\"\nOften her only recourse is home cooking, and even then Anzai runs into problems. Grocery stores that cater to expatriates usually carry good-quality everyday foodstuffs such as udon and soba, both varieties of noodle; nori, or dry seaweed, and seasonings such as wasabi and soy sauce.\n\"They carry these things for exotically-oriented Latvians,\" she said.\nBut a true Japanese cook will not find ingredients that meet the delicate needs of the Japanese palate, such as mirin, or sweet rice wine used for cooking; dried bonito flakes; and aburaage, or deep-fried bean curd.\nA lack of good ingredients sets some people off on culinary adventures.\nYuki Kobayashi, who lives in Blantyre, Malawi, likes natto, or fermented soybeans. Her natto sometimes find its way into her spaghetti, as will her tarako, or cod roe.\nThe latter dish is a popular menu item at Italian restaurants in Japan, where it is called tarako spaghetti; in Italy, it is known as spaghetti alla bottarga.\nBeing a landlocked nation, Malawi does not have ready access to seafood, so Koyabashi said she saved her sushi- and sashimi-eating for a binge during visits to South Africa and Tanzania, where seafood is plentiful.\nAt home, she will slice avocado into thin pieces and dip them in soy sauce with wasabi. \"It's kind of a substitute for sashimi,\" she said.\nA version of sushi called chirashi is easier to prepare where genuine Japanese ingredients are hard to get. Chirashi is vinegared rice served in a large bowl with a variety of ingredients like fish, cooked eggs, nori, and sliced vegetables sprinkled on top. \"I put tuna into it,\" Kobayashi said.\nSome Japanese living abroad make tofu at home, she said, out of soybeans. \"My husband doesn't like tofu, so we are not doing it,\" she added.\nBut Kobayashi recently brought home seeds of shiso, or Japanese basil, which is used to add flavor and aroma to such traditional dishes as sushi.\nIf it takes root, she said, \"I am hoping that this will add a Japanese feeling and taste to the food I prepare.\"",

    "text": "India moves to name defense aide as foreign minister - Asia - Pacific - International Herald Tribune\n2006-10-24T05:00:00.000Z\nNEW DELHI \u2014 Nearly a year after India lost its foreign minister to the Iraqi oil- for-food scandal, the government was set Tuesday to assign its defense minister to the post as part of long-awaited cabinet shuffle.\nPranab Mukherjee was expected to be sworn in as the new foreign minister late Tuesday, sources at the Ministry of External Affairs confirmed. His appointment would end a long search by the government to find someone both politically acceptable and sufficiently experienced to handle the job.\nA veteran Congress party minister, Mukherjee was first appointed to a ministerial post in 1974 and has already served as foreign minister, in 1995 and 1996 in the government of Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao. He also held the post of finance minister during an earlier administration.\nThe news was welcomed by foreign policy analysts and diplomats in India, many of whom have said that the void at the head of the ministry was hampering the conduct of India's foreign policy.\nThe post of foreign minister has been held by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh since November, when Natwar Singh resigned after being named in an inquiry into abuse of the UN oil-for-food program in Iraq. Although he vigorously denied any misconduct, he was suspended from the Congress party in August after a judicial inquiry found him and his son, Jagat Singh, guilty of abusing their positions to secure favorable oil contracts under the UN program.\nManmohan Singh's extensive commitments have made it difficult for him or the ministry to guide Indian foreign policy in a number of critical areas. Commentators said that the ministry's attentions have been absorbed by India's rapidly changing relationship with the United States, and less focus has been given to regional issues, in which India has traditionally mediated.\n\"There is a clear need for a foreign minister at such a happening time both globally and regionally,\" Uday Bhaskar of the Delhi-based Institute of Defense Studies and Analysis said, noting simmering tensions in neighboring Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh, as well as delicate ties with Pakistan and China. \"The load that the prime minister has been carrying has been heavy.\"\nMukherjee's move to the Foreign Ministry was expected to trigger a more comprehensive cabinet changes.\nPopular with the Congress party leader, Sonia Gandhi, Mukherjee, 70, was an obvious choice for the Foreign Ministry, but sources in the Congress party told Indian media that he had been unwilling initially to move from his post at the Defense Ministry, wary of the amount of foreign travel his new job would entail and concerned that it would represent a demotion, because he would no longer be chairing cabinet meetings in the prime minister's absence.\nTV station in Kashmir is hit\nSuspected Islamic militants bombed a television office in Indian Kashmir on Tuesday, Agence France-Presse reported from Srinagar, citing the police. The explosion killed a passer-by as troops killed two rebels and a civilian in another incident, the police said Tuesday.",

Ms. Collingham skillfully weaves her way through the complex cultural transactions that yielded a specialized Anglo-Indian cuisine based, in large part, on mutual misunderstanding. The English were used to starting a meal with soup. The Indians do not divide meals into courses, and have no soup. Liquids are poured over rice. Nevertheless, eager to please, Indian cooks in Madras used the most souplike dish ready to hand, a peppery tamarind broth called molo tunny, and jazzed it up with rice, vegetable and meat. This cultural mishmash became an Anglo-Indian classic, mulligatawny soup. Many others followed.\nThe British rarely stayed put in India, and as they moved from city to city they carried their hybrid foods with them.

    "text": "How to Fight Poverty: 8 Programs That Work\n2006-11-16T05:00:00.000Z\nAsk Americans whether they want to spend taxpayer money to educate girls abroad, and 80 percent say yes. Do they want to give food and medical assistance in poor countries? Eighty four percent do. Prevent and treat AIDS? That\u2019s 79 percent. \nBut ask them whether they favor foreign aid, and only a bare majority does. \nThis disconnect occurs because a lot of Americans are concerned about how foreign aid is spent. Most Americans think Washington should help the needy abroad. But they worry the money will be wasted. \nThere are too many stories about taxpayer funds winding up in the Swiss bank accounts of dictators, financing dams and highways that never get built or paying exorbitant salaries to American consultants. Americans also wonder when they hear about how miserable life in some countries continues to be: why doesn\u2019t foreign aid seem to be doing any good? \nOne reason is that not much money goes to combating that misery. \nWhen pollsters ask people in the United States to guess how much their government spends on foreign aid, the median response is 25 percent of the federal budget \u2013 and Americans think that it should be 10 percent. The real number is less than 1 percent. And only a tiny percentage of that goes to fight poverty. \nThat percentage was even smaller during the Cold War, when a large chunk of American foreign aid went into dictators\u2019 pockets or to their helicopter fleets. Its purpose was not to help people, but to buy friends. \nBut even today, 39 percent of the State Department's foreign aid budget goes to military aid, supporting congenial governments like Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Pakistan, and to fighting drugs. \nOf the money that is marked for development \u2013 to help poor countries get richer \u2013 a lot goes to programs to help a nation\u2019s central bank become more independent or to train congressional staff. This is important work, but it does not fight poverty. And a lot of what remains goes to help people in emergencies \u2013 feeding the hungry after crop failures, or rebuilding after a tsunami. \nNot much is left for preventing crop failures in the first place. President Bush has proposed to give $23.7 billion in aid grants to poor countries in 2007. But even by the most generous calculations, only $3.7 billion is actually anti-poverty aid.\nIf antipoverty efforts do not help as much as Americans would like, one reason is that their government is spending far less than they think it is. This is unfortunate because there are programs out there with a proven track record of working \u2014 of lifting poor people out of poverty, and keeping them out \u2014 some run by governments, some by charity groups, and a few by businesses. \nHere are some particularly effective ones. \nI. The Gold Standard: Universal Vaccination \nUniversal vaccination is cost-effective foreign aid at its best. It is so successful, so widely considered essential, that many people today do not realize that it began only 20 years ago. \nWhen Unicef and the World Health Organization started a global effort to vaccinate children against common childhood diseases in 1985, they were met with widespread skepticism. Vaccination rates for children in many countries were appalling \u2013 only 20 percent of the world's children in 1980 had gotten their third shot of D.P.T. (diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus) on time, the conventional measure of vaccine coverage.\nBut the program has had stunning success. By 1990, 75 percent of children had completed their D.P.T. shots on time. Bangladesh went from 9 percent D.P.T. completion in 1987 to 98 percent five years later. Worldwide, children were being immunized against polio and measles as well. \nThe logistics are heroic. Wars are routinely halted for inoculation campaigns. Entire countries get vaccinated in two days. Measles vaccines are successfully kept cold during day-long journeys by bicycle and canoe. \n A full course of immunization, including everything in the supply chain, costs only $30. In the last 20 years this campaign has saved 20 million lives. It has given hundreds of millions of children a better start. \nIn the 1990s, however, the world\u2019s attention turned to other problems, and vaccination rates slipped backwards. Bangladesh fell back to 66 percent in 1999. Every year 27 million children \u2014 a quarter of the world\u2019s children \u2014 go unvaccinated against the basic diseases. Two to three million of these children die. Even for those who survive, these diseases can be crushing, forcing children to drop out of school, and parents to spend time and money they cannot afford on doctors and care for their sick children. \nThe challenge today is two-fold: to improve basic vaccine coverage, and to put new vaccines into global use. Vaccines now exist to protect children against common diarrheal and pneumococcal killers, against hepatitis B and a common influenza. But they are mainly in use in wealthy countries. Soon there may be a malaria vaccine as well. All these must become part of the universal vaccine package.\nHelp has come from an organization launched in 2000, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization. Financed by governments, organizations such as the World Bank and Unicef and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, GAVI gives poor countries money to improve their infrastructure and logistics \u2013 and then gives them more if they actually achieve improved vaccination rates. It also helps assure a predictable market for new vaccines, which encourages drug makers to produce them in large quantities. It has helped expand both basic and new vaccine coverage \u2013 because of GAVI, for example,  90 million children have been immunized against hepatitis B(pdf). \nImmunization became a victim of its success, but close attention and new partnerships are now reviving vaccines. It is a lesson that eternal vigilance is needed, even to protect a program that became venerable practically overnight.\nII. Give Poor People an Ownership Stake \n Look around the edges of any large third world city and you will see vast settlements built by the residents themselves. Migrants from the countryside claim empty plots in nighttime land invasions, put up a blanket with a pole or a cardboard roof and begin stockpiling bricks. Their livelihoods are similarly jerry-rigged. A man will nail together a booth, at which he can sit and repair his neighbors\u2019 shoes. A woman will open a window to the street to turn her living room into a mini-bodega, selling cooking oil and rice. \nMost people surveying these kingdoms of dust and hope see only poverty. But Hernando de Soto saw something else \u2013 untapped wealth. Mr. De Soto, a Peruvian economist, realized that the world\u2019s poor own trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of assets. But their houses, plots of land and businesses lacked formal title \u2013 and so could not be used to do all the things that people in wealthy countries do to turn a little money into a lot of money. \nWithout title, people can not sell stakes in their businesses, use their homes as collateral for loans, buy insurance, or form limited liability corporations to reduce their personal risk. They cannot get credit in banks. They do not improve their businesses because their investment may suddenly vanish at any moment. They must spend money and time bribing the police to keep from being kicked off their land. In many cases they cannot even get electricity and telephone service. \nMr. De Soto\u2019s crusade, which has now marched to El Salvador, Egypt, Mexico, Honduras, Tanzania, El Salvador, the Philippines, Haiti, Albania and elsewhere, attempts to turn these dead assets into living capital. All countries, of course, have ways to register property. But in most poor nations, they involve so much red tape that they are essentially useless for the poor. Mr. De Soto had tried an experiment in Peru \u2013 he established a two-sewing machine garment factory in a Lima slum and hired five college students to get all the necessary permits to legalize it. He claims it took them 289 days and cost them 31 times the average monthly minimum wage. \nMr. De Soto likes to say that when he walks through the rice fields in Bali, a different dog barks whenever he crosses from one farm to another. The dogs recognize the assets under their masters\u2019 control. But the legal system does not. \nTo change this, Mr. De Soto founded an organization in Lima called the Institute for Liberty and Democracy. It carries out research on the informal sector. But the governments of Peru and El Salvador have also hired the I.L.D. to run registries that give poor people simple, quick ways to get title for their land, homes and businesses. It also helps them use those titles productively. In other countries, I.L.D. is helping governments design such agencies or train government officials to do this work. \nThe I.L.D.\u2019s work in Peru means that legalizing a business can now be done in a day, by visiting a single desk. The cost dropped from $1,200 to $174. The group says that between 1990 and 1995, 300,000 titles were registered in urban Lima (pdf), and the value of the underlying land doubled by 1998. Hundreds of thousands of new businesses have been legalized. Poor people saved millions in administrative costs, and Peru raised millions of dollars in new taxes. \n Getting title, of course, does not mean that poor people can necessarily turn it into higher incomes. To use newly legal assets, the poor must still contend with banks that won't lend to them, and courts that require bribes and put up other hurdles. Tackling these issues may help solve one of the most vexing drawbacks of globalization and the market economy \u2013 in much of the third world, they have tended to benefit only the wealthiest. But establishing property rights is a necessary first step.\nIII. Microcredit: The 62-Cent Solution\n In 1976, a Bangladeshi economist named Muhammad Yunus came upon a group of 42 artisans \u2013 but perhaps the more appropriate word is \u201cslaves.\u201d They made crafts such as chair seats, and used materials lent to them each day at exorbitant rates of interest by the buyer of their work. They were forever in debt, unable to turn enough profit to buy their materials in advance at market prices. Mr. Yunus gave the group a loan from his pocket that averaged 62 cents per person. With that, they bought their freedom. \nTwenty years later, the Grameen Bank, the organization Mr. Yunus founded, has lent small sums of money to 6.7 million people in Bangladesh, almost all of them women, many of whom had never before touched money. It offers savings, insurance, home mortgages, pension funds, scholarships, credit for families to buy fertilizer, build latrines or dig wells, and a program of no-interest loans for beggars, so they can offer candy or dried chiles for sale as they go house to house.\n Microcredit now reaches nearly 100 million clients in more than 100 countries. The World Bank has found that microcredit accounted for 40 percent of the entire reduction in moderate poverty in rural Bangladesh \u2014and that it had an even bigger impact on extremely poor borrowers.\nMicrocredit raises an entire village\u2019s standard of living \u2013 even non-borrowers\u2019 lives improve. (Lending to men, by contrast, proved not to affect poverty at all.) Studies of microcredit programs all over the world show that it produces higher incomes and better-fed children, and improves a family\u2019s ability to survive illness or drought. \n To many people, the name Grameen is synonymous with microcredit. But the Grameen Bank is not even the largest microcredit lender in Bangladesh \u2013 that is the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee. Nor were Mr. Yunus\u2019s 62 cent loans the first \u2013 the earliest documented microloan took place in 1973, in Recife, Brazil, lent by Accion International , a group that has now lent over $10 billion. \nBut what Mr. Yunus and Grameen did \u2013 why they are sharing the 2006 Nobel Prize for Peace -- was show how an idea helping a few hundred people could be expanded to help millions. Grameen has also struck the proper balance \u2013 it is sustainable and profitable, with $600 million in savings from borrowers as capital. At the same time, it has never forgotten that its mission is to fight poverty, not maximize profit. It charges interest rates far lower than other commercial microlenders. \nGrameen developed a model now in use globally. Although it is a bank, in many ways it is the opposite of a bank. Traditional banks in poor countries do not lend to the poor \u2014 administrative costs are too high, and the poor were thought to be bad risks. Normal banks stick close to business districts, require collateral, and lend mainly to men. \nGrameen turned this on its head. Instead of collateral, Grameen depends on social pressure to guarantee loans. Women form borrowing groups of five, and must pay back their loans regularly for others in the group to be able to get one; borrowers must pledge to eliminate dowry, eat vegetables, have small families and educate their children \u2014 requirements not likely to be found at conventional banks. \nIt has been a decade since Grameen Bank accepted any donations or took loans. But hundreds of newer microfinance groups still look for donors. Accion International, for example, creates new microfinance institutions in 22 countries, which stop needing help once they become profitable. It also trains traditional banks in how to lend to the poor. \nMicrocredit started as an antipoverty program, but continues as a business. That is one reason it has grown and grown while other forms of aid fight for governments\u2019 dollars and attention.\nIV. Bribe the Poor \nIn 1995, the Mexican peso crashed and the economy contracted by 6 percent. At the time, Santiago Levy, the deputy finance minister, realized that the country\u2019s antipoverty programs were going to fail its poor. The programs were a hodgepodge of food subsidies, adopted in response to powerful food producers. They were inefficient because they targeted foods everyone ate, rich and poor. Some even targeted foods the poor don\u2019t eat, such as bread \u2013 poor Mexicans eat tortillas. \nMr. Levy saw a looming disaster \u2013 but also an opportunity to build political support for an antipoverty program that worked. Stealthily, he organized a pilot project to test a new idea in Campeche, far away from the capital so it would draw little notice. He began a program to pay poor mothers to keep their children in school and take their kids to the health clinic. He compared the results to poverty figures in a group of similar villages without the program. It was a great success. Data in hand, he persuaded President Ernesto Zedillo to phase in the new program and phase out the food subsidies. \nOportunidades, formerly called Progresa, is now embraced by all parties in Mexico and, with financing from the World Bank, is helping virtually every poor family. It not only focuses antipoverty spending on those who really need it, it does so in a way that encourages families to break the cycle of poverty for their children.\nThe average family in Oportunidades gets $35 a month \u2013 about a quarter of the rural family income. Families with many children in school can get up to $153 a month, a ceiling imposed to avoid providing incentive to have more children. \nFrom the beginning, Oportunidades built in rigorous evaluation. Those studies have shown that it does focus its help on Mexico\u2019s poorest people, and that the money is producing good results. Children are bigger and healthier. Oportunidades has also cut child labor and led to more schooling \u2013 in rural areas, for example, the number of children starting high school increased 85 percent. Moreover, by paying women, Oportunidades has augmented their power inside the family without increasing domestic violence. \nThere are fashions in foreign aid, and Oportunidades is hot. The World Bank sings its praises (pdf). So far 25 countries have adopted some version. New York mayor Michael Bloomberg just announced he is looking for donors to finance a pilot program to test whether New Yorkers, too, can be bribed out of poverty.\nV. Link Up the Villages\n When Shenggen Fan, now 45, was growing up in a village in China, it could take two days to get to Shanghai by motorboat and then bus. It took him an hour to walk to high school. Farmers grew only products they could eat or sell to their neighbors. \n Now when he lands in Shanghai, he can drive to his family\u2019s home in three hours. The high school is a 10-minute bike ride from his house. Farmers now buy animal feed and fertilizer from trucks visiting the village, and sell other visitors the cereals, watermelons and pigs they raise. The village has grown much more prosperous.\n What has changed? Roads. Dirt trails were first replaced with all-weather roads made of broken bricks mixed with dirt, with drainage. Then the road to town was paved. \n Almost everything people need to be able to live decently requires a road. A good dirt road with ditches is fine, or one built by villagers themselves with local stones or locally-made bricks. It just needs to be a road that allows a farmer to push his products to market in a hand cart, and that lets buses and trucks get from the village to the main trunk roads. The villagers themselves can maintain it. \nRoads allow farmers to market their products, and bring in fertilizer and seeds. They let rural residents take non-farming jobs in nearby towns. Sick people can get to the hospital in time. Roads make it easier for the government to bring in water and electricity. Children can get to school faster, which means more will go. \u201cWith roads, people travel out and bring in new knowledge,\u201d says Mr. Fan. \u201cThey change their behavior. Roads are a window to the outside world. In extreme cases, roads are life-saving \u2013 in the Ethiopian famine of 1984 and 1985, thousands of people died because they could not be reached by food aid.\u201d \n Today Mr. Fan is a Senior Research Fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington. The studies he and his colleagues have done on how poor governments should spend their money show that building small feeder roads is one of the single most effective ways to fight poverty (pdf). In India, it would be the single most effective antipoverty program, the group concluded. Feeder roads would also be among the best ways to spend money in Africa and China. \nRural roads are not glamorous. Government officials want to build highways, not feeder roads. China, for example, has expanded its national highway system by 44 percent a year since 1988. But rural roads have expanded only 3 percent a year. In Africa, fewer than 10 percent of feeder roads are currently passable during the rainy season, effectively cutting off villages for months at a time. \n Thirty years ago, the World Bank concentrated on infrastructure. But many of its projects to build dams, highways and electrical plants were plagued with corruption and waste, or ended up hurting poor people. Building infrastructure, including roads, got a bad name. What's needed today is the infrastructure equivalent of microcredit \u2013 small projects for villagers that are a necessary first step out of poverty. \nVI. Target the Decision-Makers \nSuppose you are a parent in rural India, or parts of Africa, or China. You are poor. School is available for your children. But you may have to pay school fees, and you must buy uniforms and books. The nearest school is in the next village \u2013 a dangerous walk for a young girl.\n Besides, you need your daughter at home to fetch water and take care of her younger siblings. You know that education is important \u2013 but it is your sons who will support you when you are old, while your daughters will become part of their husbands\u2019 families. Your decision is easy \u2013 the boys, and only the boys, go to school. \n Gene Sperling, formerly President Clinton\u2019s national economic advisor, now at the Council on Foreign Relations, likes to talk about the central paradox in girls\u2019 education: Going to school is good for girls. Educated girls make more money. They are more productive farmers and have smaller, healthier, better-educated families of their own. They are even less likely to catch the AIDS virus. Educating girls is also great policy for a nation. Closing the educational gender gap boosts economic growth.\n But educating girls is not necessarily good for parents \u2013 and they make the decisions. Most poor people in the world live in societies in which the girl marries into her husband\u2019s family. Educating a daughter, these cultures say, is like watering a neighbor\u2019s garden. Parents will send their girls to school only if the costs are very low. \n That\u2019s one reason why far fewer girls than boys go to school. Of children in primary school today, 150 million will drop out before they finish \u2013 two thirds of them girls. In Africa, the majority of girls do not finish primary school.\n School is often very expensive. School fees in some countries, such as the Congo, are more than the national per capita income. When Tanzania abolished school fees in January, 2002, school attendance doubled overnight \u2013 and most of the new students were girls. There are other costs. Parents must buy books and uniforms. When Kenya tried abolishing fees for uniforms, books and school construction in some places, students stayed in school 15 percent longer. \n The other cost to parents is the lost value of the girls\u2019 work at home. To solve this problem, many countries now pay families to send children, especially girls, to school. It is a central feature of Oportunidades-style cash payments, for example. Bangladesh's government provides 15 to 20 kilograms of grain, mainly wheat, per month to families of poor boys and girls if they maintain 85 percent attendance in primary school. The government also pays a stipend to all girls in rural areas in grades 6 through 10, covering the cost of tuition, exams, books, supplies, uniforms, transportation and even kerosene for lamps to study by. The girls must keep up minimum grades, attend classes and not get married until out of school. This program has boosted girls\u2019 enrollment from 27 percent to 60 percent. \n Bangladesh is also home to the schools run by BRAC, the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee. BRAC's community schools have doubled the completion rates of government schools by overcoming the hidden obstacles to educating girls.. BRAC runs more than 30,000 schools for poor students, many in places where the nearest government school is far away. Teachers are women \u2013 often local high school graduates given training by BRAC. These features reassure parents that their daughters will be safe on the way to school and while in class. School schedules work around harvests and allow girls to be home during peak chore times. BRAC schools are run in close consultation with parents and do everything possible to help parents give their daughters the gift of learning. \nVII. A Green Revolution for Africa \nWhat was probably the single most effective antipoverty program in world history began in northern Mexico in the 1940s. Test plots showed that new varieties of dwarf wheat resisted many plant pests and diseases, and doubled or tripled the usual yields. Similar improvements followed in corn and rice. The Rockefeller and Ford Foundations spread the seeds to India and Pakistan, and parts of Asia, Latin America and North Africa, along with irrigation techniques, pesticides and fertilizer. \nThe Green Revolution is not yet over \u2013 productivity continues to increase, and even faster than in the early days. It has prevented famine and brought improvements in income, health and survival to hundreds of millions of people.\n But few of them are in sub-Saharan Africa. Africa\u2019s farmers get less than half the amount of grain per acre that Asian farmers get. From 1980 to 2000, India\u2019s agricultural yields rose 28 percent. Africa\u2019s dropped by 7 percent. \n A Green Revolution for Africa is a challenge. Africa\u2019s climate is much more varied than south Asia\u2019s, so what crops need varies from place to place. Africa\u2019s infrastructure is worse than India\u2019s was, the soil is more degraded and AIDS is killing off the continent\u2019s labor force. \n But while a single Green Revolution benefiting all of Africa may not be possible, a patchwork of Green Revolutions is. Indeed, this is happening. \nThe Earth Institute at Columbia University is working with 78 villages across Africa to help them improve crop yields, part of a demonstration project trying to attack several different causes of poverty at once. Each village gets help with crops, clean water, nutrition, schools and health, for a total cost of no more than $110 per person per year. The Millennium Village project hopes to show that conquering poverty is possible for very little money. In agriculture, the project provides appropriate seeds and fertilizers to farmers who pledge to contribute part of their surplus to local schools for their lunch program. The subsidies diminish as farmers become able to buy the seeds and fertilizers themselves, and after three years the farmers are on their own. \n Even after just one year, success has been notable. Farmers are growing a minimum of 3.5 times as much grain as before, with one village in Rwanda increasing its output 62-fold. \nCan this be done on a large scale? The evidence says yes. \nEthiopia \u2013 a country once emblematic of crop failure and hunger \u2013 has doubled food production in the last 10 years and the government says it will double again by 2010. Malawi\u2019s harvest this year was double that of last year. Ethiopia\u2019s strategy was to provide farmers with better seed, more fertilizer, and hundreds of extension agents to spread good techniques. Malawi began to pick up 75 percent of the cost of farmers\u2019 fertilizer and seed. Many farmers are now able to feed their families and sell surplus crops for the first time. Part of the advance has been luck \u2013 good rains. But success today will give farmers a cushion and better tools for withstanding the next drought. \n The initial costs of improving crop yields is daunting for many governments in Africa. But if the Millennium Villages and countries like Ethiopia and Malawi can show success, they will make a strong case that farmers mainly need a one-time boost and that the benefits are great for Africa\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable to drought.\n\nVIII. Hold the Patient\u2019s Hand \nTuberculosis is curable. Millions of people alive today can personally attest to the power of antibiotics. A simple course of four antibiotics, which costs as little as $11, can now vanquish a dreaded killer. \n So why do nearly 2 million people a year still die of it? Because these antibiotics must be taken daily for six to nine months. That means that the local health clinic must have a steady supply. Patients must continue to take the full course even though they stop coughing, and the medicine causes nasty side effects. TB strikes mostly the poor, especially those living in crowded conditions. Many of them are migrants, who may be lost to the health system when they move. \n If they don't finish the course, terrible things can happen. Patients stay sick, but now with a form of TB resistant to the basic drugs. Medicines that can cure this form of TB can cost $10,000, and the course of treatment is two years. Because of poor adherence, resistance has reached the point where some forms of TB are incurable. South Africa is battling an outbreak of this extremely resistant TB, and no doubt many other places are as well \u2013 they just don\u2019t know it yet. \nThe solution is a strategy invented in Tanzania in the 1970s and now in use all over the world, called DOTS, for Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course. \nDOTS has several components \u2013 among them good supply management and diagnosis \u2013 but what is key is what it is named for. Someone becomes a pill pal, with the job of watching the patient swallow the medicines. This can be a neighbor, a family member, or a community health worker. \nDOTS is now widespread \u2013 it covers about 60 percent of the world\u2019s diagnosed TB cases. It greatly improves the chance of cure. DOTS gives patients a social incentive to take their pills. But sometimes other layers of incentive are necessary as well. In her book \u201cMillions Saved ,\u201d Ruth Levine, the director of programs at the Center for Global Development in Washington, writes about China\u2019s TB program. In 1990, TB in China was the leading cause of death in adults, killing 360,000 people that year. The next year, China switched to DOTS. \n China found a way to make DOTS even more effective  \u2013 by relying on the market. With help from the World Bank, China\u2019s government pays village health workers to find TB patients, get them to the lab for periodic sputum checks, and see them through the full treatment course. The pill pal gets a bonus, too, as does the health center. China\u2019s TB cure rate went from 52 percent to 95 percent, which prevents 30,000 TB deaths per year. Rates of resistant TB are far lower in the parts of China where DOTS is used. \nDOTS is one of the most cost-effective health programs around. Each cure costs just $100, and brings a return of $60 for every dollar spent. It works because the drugs are cheap and it relies on community workers instead of doctors. The DOTS strategy recognizes that the promise of being cured is not always enough to change the way people behave. It uses social \u2013 and occasionally monetary \u2013 incentives to get the community and the patient working towards health.\nThese are not the only good programs. There are many more out there \u2013 family planning, provision of small amounts of nutrients such as Vitamin A, agroforestry to restore the fertility of soil, to name a few. But the above eight are some of the best. \nA few common threads link these eight programs. \nMany of them rely on the market. Microcredit and property legalization help poor people to start businesses. Other programs pay people for desired behavior. \nAnother common element is a focus on women and girls, who tend to be poorest of the poor and use help more efficiently than men. \nA lot of these programs got their start when one individual looked at a familiar landscape in a fresh way. \nThe most important things these programs share, however, is that they work -- and with more money they could be working on a grander scale. Financing them, and others like them, is the kind of foreign aid Americans say they want, and should have.",

    "text": "If not U.S. as world government, then who?\n2006-03-03T05:00:00.000Z\n\nThe Case for Goliath\nHow America Acts as the World's Government in the Twenty-First Century\nBy Michael Mandelbaum\n283 pages. $26; \u00a315.50. PublicAffairs.\nMichael Mandelbaum has taken all the fun out of an ostensibly flippant but fundamentally serious diplomatic parlor game. Usually played late at night when the Americans have gone home to prepare for their puritanically early start to the day, the Europeans, Latin Americans and Asians take a second glass of Cognac and imagine how awful the world could be if someone else were to take the place of the United States as the global hegemon.\nEastern Europeans tell sad anecdotes about living under Russian dominance. Western Europeans shudder at the thought of Germans running the benign and virtual empire that the United States has maintained and expanded for the past 60 years. (And they murmur that within the European Union the French are already being difficult enough.) The Latin Americans have their hands full with the arrogance of next-door neighbors like Brazil without wanting to see it become even more dominant. The idea of a Chinese hegemony sends shivers down the backs of all, particularly the Japanese and Indians; somebody usually mentions the mournful example of Tibet. The Pakistanis, Sri Lankans and Bangladeshis react equally unhappily to the idea of India as superpower. As the diplomats prattle on, meanwhile, the British smile wryly and say they have been there, done that and are extremely glad to have lost the T-shirt.\nMandelbaum, the Christian A. Herter professor of American foreign policy at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, pulls aside the curtain of diplomatic civility to expose the crude and obvious reality that everyone prefers to ignore, at least in public. He explains coolly and clearly the various ways in which the United States now functions as a global government, offering the planet the services of physical security, commercial regulation, financial stability and legal recourse that are normally provided by national governments to their citizens.\nNon-Americans naturally do not like to admit this, even as they enjoy the results, and American leaders do not like to spell it out, least of all to the voters who pay for it. But the evidence is clear. The network of military alliances (like NATO) and trade pacts (like the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) and international organizations (like the United Nations and World Bank and Group of 8) that the United States was mainly responsible for bringing to life has become an American-led global management system. It is familiar, inclusive and fairly unobtrusive. Its institutions provide a reasonable role for lesser powers, which is why the NATO alliance of consent survived and expanded while the wretched conscripts of the Warsaw Pact rebelled.\nAbove all, this system has been a remarkable and seductive economic success. Having built the tripartite trading structure of the modern world (North America, Western Europe and Japan) to enrich its citizens and allies and sustain the Cold War, the generous Americans have expanded it to include the Asian tigers and Eastern Europeans.\nNow 1.3 billion Chinese and 1.1 billion Indians are clambering up the food chain to prosperity. They deal in dollars, raise money in the New York and London financial markets, generate big trade surpluses with the United States and then send their brighter and most ambitious children to American graduate and business schools, where they are exposed to the Western value system.\nThis is a magnificently benign loop, and will continue to be so once those American-trained graduates figure out how the biosphere is going to handle tens of millions of Asians living the American lifestyle, with their own cars and air conditioning and fast food.\nThis international system, an improved and democratized version of the clunky British model that brought us the 19th-century wave of globalization, is designed to operate to American comfort and profit, while securing compliance by sharing security and prosperity with others. But it is no longer doing so quite as reliably as it once did. Trade imbalances and the Bush administration's fiscal policies are putting it in jeopardy.\n 1 \n2\nNext Page \u00bb\n",

    "text": "Rumor, Fear and Fatigue Hinder Final Push to End Polio\n2006-03-20T05:00:00.000Z\nBAREILLY, India - The cry went up the moment the polio vaccination team was spotted -- \"Hide your children!\"\nSome families slammed doors on the two volunteers going house to house with polio drops in this teeming city's decrepit maze of lanes, saying that they feared the vaccine would sicken or sterilize their children, or simply that they were fed up with the long drive to eradicate polio.\n\"We have a lot of other problems, and you don't care about those,\" shouted one woman from behind a locked door. \"All you have is drops. My children get other diseases, and we don't get help.\"\nNearly 18 years ago, in what they described as a \"gift from the 20th century to the 21st,\" public health officials and volunteers around the world committed themselves to eliminating polio from the planet by the year 2000.\nSince then, some two billion children have been vaccinated, cutting incidence of the disease more than 99 percent and saving some five million from paralysis or death, the World Health Organization estimates.\nBut six years past the deadline, even optimists warn that total eradication is far from assured. The drive against polio threatens to become a costly display of all that can conspire against even the most ambitious efforts to eliminate a disease: cultural suspicions, logistical nightmares, competition for resources from many other afflictions, and simple exhaustion. So monumental is the challenge, in fact, that only one disease has ever been eradicated -- smallpox. As the polio campaign has shown, even the miracle of discovering a vaccine is not enough.\nNot least among the obstacles is that many poor countries that eliminated polio have let their vaccination efforts slide, making the immunity covering much of the world extremely fragile, polio experts warn. They compare it to a vast, tinder-dry forest: if even one tree is still burning, a single cinder can drift downwind and start a fire virtually anywhere.\nHere in northern India the embers are still glowing. And northern Nigeria, another densely populated, desperately poor region, is aflame.\nIn a calamitous setback in mid-2003, Nigeria's northern states halted the vaccination campaign for a year after rumors swept the region that the vaccine contained the AIDS virus or was part of a Western plot to sterilize Muslim girls. Within a couple of years, 18 once polio-free countries have had outbreaks traceable to Nigeria. Though most have since been tamed, Indonesia and Nigeria itself remain major worries. In 2001, there were fewer than 500 confirmed cases of polio paralysis in the world. Last year, the number jumped to more than 1,900 -- and each paralyzed child means another 200 \"silent carriers\" spreading the disease.\nThis year in addition to India and Nigeria, cases have been reported in Somalia, Niger, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia.\nYet no eradication effort against any disease has been as well financed or as comprehensive as the polio drive, which has cost $4 billion so far. In the balance is not just whether polio will be extinguished, many public health officials say, but whether a world that could not quite conquer polio will have the stomach to try to wipe out other diseases, like measles. The closer a disease is to eradication, they say, the harder won the gains. Interest lags as the number of cases falls. Fatigue sets in among volunteers, donors and average people. Yet even one unvaccinated child can allow a new pocket of the disease to bloom.\nHere and elsewhere, eradicating polio means finding ways to get polio drops into the mouths of every child under 5 -- over and over. Because it can take many doses to effectively immunize a child in parts of the world where the disease circulates intensely, eradication requires repeated sweeps. Campaigns are planned to the smallest detail. Each lane is mapped. Supervisors shadow vaccination teams. Follow-up specialists pursue resistant families. \"Here, polio eradication has been going on for 10 years, and that's too long,\" said David C. Bassett, 63, an old smallpox hand sent to India by the World Health Organization to help with polio. \"The public's sick of it. The workers are sick of it. The government's sick of it. We're close now. We need to mobilize resources. The donors aren't going to keep putting up money for this forever.\"\nNigeria's Agony\nAminu Ahmed's legs are so withered he must lean on something just to sit up in the cement courtyard of his home in Kano, in northern Nigeria. He \"walks\" by swinging his hips in an arc on his six-inch hand crutches.\nBut Mr. Ahmed, 45, is a natural leader. He is the president of the Kano State Polio Victims Association, which owns the welding shop where he builds hand-cranked tricycles for other polio victims. He coached Kano's handicapped soccer team to three national championships. And he owns a home. It may be at the end of a slum alley, where drinking water is sold in cans and the sewers are shallow ditches, but he earned enough to pay healthy men to build it.\nHis wife, Hadiza, whom he met at the polio association, has given him six children. The youngest, Omar, 2, was born shortly before Kano's conservative Muslim government stopped its polio vaccinations. Today, like his father before him, he drags himself across the cement courtyard. The joints of his spindly legs are covered with calluses.\nHe has polio, too.\n\"This is why we enlighten people to give their children the vaccine,\" Mr. Ahmed said, explaining why he went on local radio programs to ask for an end to the vaccination moratorium. \"Because we don't want people to be cripples like us.\"\nThe collapse of Nigeria's drive has become a lesson in the ways eradication campaigns can go terribly awry. \"Nigeria is clearly far and away the greatest risk to the eradication effort,\" said Dr. Stephen L. Cochi, a senior adviser in the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's immunization program. The quality of its campaigns is the worst in Africa, he said. \"They're just missing lots and lots of kids.\"\nNigeria's president, Olusegun Obasanjo, who is from the Christian, Yoruba-speaking south, has apologized for his country's role in reigniting the disease, but officials in the Muslim north are defensive. Asked last year whether he had been right to stop the vaccinations, Kano's governor, Ibrahim Shekarau, cut off an interview. \"We're not saying it didn't spread, and we're not saying people didn't suffer,\" he said. \"But I had a moral responsibility to our population to stop it until it was clear there was no harm.\"\nHis health minister, Dr. Sanda Mohammed, also refused to discuss the subject, even sending word into his waiting room that he was out of the city, while aides admitted he was behind a locked door. But in a brief conversation on his cellphone, he insisted that the decision was right because Kano residents had become so suspicious of government health workers that they were refusing all vaccinations. \"It would have been a bigger disaster if we had vaccinated people at gunpoint,\" Dr. Mohammed said.\nAs is often the case with rumors, they appeared based on distortions of fact amplified by an alarmist media and by politicians and clerics absorbed in a religiously divisive presidential election campaign.\nA controversial 1999 book, \"The River,\" helped raise doubts. Its thesis was that the source of human AIDS was an experimental polio vaccine used in the Belgian Congo in the 1950's that had been grown on a medium of chimpanzee cells containing a monkey virus that is considered the precursor of AIDS. Most AIDS experts reject the theory. The author of the book, Edward Hooper, has never suggested that modern polio vaccines contain any AIDS virus, but confused Nigerian journalists raised the possibility that they did. Then scientists from a Nigerian university claimed they had found estrogen in the polio vaccine. Estrogen is the main ingredient in birth control pills, and in Africa any talk of birth control is highly controversial. Inflammatory speakers equate it with genocide by whites or by ruling tribes trying to eliminate lesser ones.\nSome vaccines are grown in calf serum, and experts say it is possible that tiny, harmless amounts of estrogen were found, but at levels that are far lower than in, say, breast milk.\nWith such rumors circulating during the hotly contested 2003 elections, in which a Muslim candidate lost to Mr. Obasanjo, \"The situation got hijacked,\" said Dr. Barbara G. Reynolds, deputy chief of the Nigerian office of Unicef. \"People who had multiple agendas ran with it.\"\nMost vocal was a wealthy Kano doctor who was both head of a campaign to impose Islamic law in northern Nigeria and a candidate for a top job in the national health department. After being denied the post, he turned against the polio drive, calling the vaccine \"tainted by evildoers from America.\" Governor Shekarau's spokesman publicly speculated that the vaccine was \"America's revenge for Sept. 11.\"\nWith residents turning vaccinators away and the threat of riots growing, Mr. Shekarau -- a well-educated rival to southern politicians -- decided to halt vaccinations until local doctors could test the vaccine. That took 10 months. Hearings were held, and teams visited vaccine factories in Indonesia, India and South Africa. Medical and religious experts from Saudi Arabia flew in to meet local clerics. Finally, the case was made that the vaccine was safe.\nIn October 2004, at a kickoff of a new round of vaccinations of 80 million children, Mr. Shekarau allowed Mr. Obasanjo personally to give his 1-year-old daughter, Zainab, the drops -- a picture that became famous in Nigeria. The emir of Kano, who rarely lets himself be seen in public, allowed himself to be photographed vaccinating children. But by then, the virus was on the loose.\nNew Drive, Old Obstacles\nNow that official opposition to Nigeria's eradication drive has melted, it is facing its old obstacles, like those in India: Scotch-tape logistics and pockets of resistance.\nAt 7 a.m. on the first day of a vaccination drive last year, the dirt courtyard of the public clinic in Kano looked like the deck of the world's most bedraggled aircraft carrier. Smashed-up minibus taxis, many with their front ends crumpled and doors held closed by rope, were waiting to take off. Like F-18's, each had a name painted on: Titanic, Dollars, Thank You Daddy.\nBy 8 a.m., after some near misses with the wobbly benches in the courtyard, most of the minibuses had left, bearing vaccinators on their rounds. But problems were quick to arise. The chief of a nearby district was unhappy that each of his teams got $23 to hire transportation for the day. Last time, he said, the money had gone directly to him, and he had made the arrangements. That was changed, a World Health Organization official said privately, because half the money was pocketed.\nThe vaccine must be kept chilled from the time it leaves the factory until it reaches a child's mouth, and the clinic's freezers looked as battered as the taxis. The day was already hot, and World Health Organization officials worried that the ice packs keeping the vaccines cold were not fully frozen. A big problem, one confided, was clinic officials \"who take the money we give them to buy big freezers, and then buy refrigerators to keep their cold drinks in.\"\nFinding enough women for the teams proved particularly tough. Only women can enter a Nigerian Muslim household if the husband is away, and women with children are better at persuading other mothers to vaccinate. But many men refused to let their wives leave home, and either wanted the jobs, which pay about $3 a day, for themselves, or sent their young daughters.\nAs a result, teenage girls could be seen leaving with empty boxes, not understanding that they were supposed to carry ice packs and 40 doses of vaccine. Others carried tally sheets that they could not fill out because they could not read.\n\"We wanted to remove males completely from the teams, but we realized it would create too much antagonism,\" said Dr. Ahmed Bello Sulaiman, a World Health Organization coordinator in rural Kano. \"For the program to work, we need each local government involved. But many local politicians want to give the jobs to people who helped them get elected -- and those are mostly men.\"\nSome families tricked the teams, erasing the chalk marks on their doorways showing that they had not cooperated, or blackening their children's thumbs with the same ink that the vaccinators had used and falsely claiming that they had been immunized.\nStill, the government seemed determined to succeed. At the campaign's command center in the capital, Abuja, the officer in charge of the vaccine \"cold chain\" -- keeping it chilled from the time it arrives in Nigeria -- knew exactly which district leader in a remote part of Kano was considered a \"joker\" by his peers and arranged for his removal and the shipping of two new freezers.\nSometimes the new determination was a bit excessive. The chief prosecutor of Katsina, another northern Nigerian state, announced he would jail for a year any parents who refused drops for their children.\nIndia's Uphill Campaign\nWhile Nigeria struggles to restart its campaign, India, whose need is such that it uses more than half the world's two billion polio vaccine doses each year, has long made an extraordinary commitment to wipe out polio. Teams like the one that faced scorn in squalid warrens of Bareilly have made repeated sweeps in the state of Uttar Pradesh, home to 180 million people, which Dr. Cochi of the Centers for Disease Control describes as \"historically the center of the universe for the polio virus.\"\nNowhere are the prospects for conquering polio more intimidating. Living conditions are so dense, public health services so awful, summer heat so sweltering, and open sewers and monsoon floods so common that a more perfect breeding ground could hardly be conjured.\nThe state, populous enough to make it the world's sixth-largest nation, has endured more than two dozen campaigns in recent years. In 2004, teams went door to door eight times. They came eight more times last year. Each round requires almost every health worker to join in for at least a week or two, local managers say, and each time vaccinators must try to get the polio drops into the mouths of 50 million children.\nInternational leaders of the global drive were hopeful last year that the country would finish off the disease -- but it still registered 66 cases. That was the lowest tally ever, but not zero. And so this year, India must repeat its consuming effort yet again, with special focus on Uttar Pradesh and other regions still trying to extinguish the last cases. Resistance has persisted where services are weakest and distrust of public officials deepest.\n\"Please open up,\" pleaded one polio volunteer, Firoza Rafiq, outside the locked door in Bareilly during a drive last year. \"We won't force you.\" The woman inside first shouted through a crack that she had no children, though a little girl had just scampered in. Challenged, she changed her story and complained that she was sick and tired of the polio drive. Mrs. Rafiq, a Muslim, and her team partner, Parvati Devi Rajput, a Hindu, chalked an X on the door, marking it for someone to come back later and try again.\nPolio spreads through oral-fecal contact: children can get it by drinking well water tainted by sewage, or simply by picking up a ball that rolled through a gutter choking with human waste. In warm or tropical climates, many similar viruses can attach to the same receptors in the intestine as the polio virus does, making it even harder to immunize a child. It can take up to 10 vaccine doses, spaced months apart.\nWith great anticipation, India and other countries began trying a new eradication strategy last year, using a \"monovalent\" vaccine that focuses only on the most common strain of polio, but gives immunity in fewer doses. The old vaccine attacked three strains of the virus, two of them less common. \"The great hope was that monovalent vaccine would be the magic bullet and melt all polio cases away, but that hasn't happened,\" Dr. Cochi said.\nWhile the new vaccine has brought India closer than ever to eradication, resistance to the vaccine has persisted in some areas.\nHere in Bareilly, the two-woman team was bolstered by a new, more senior volunteer, Mohammad Ejaz Anjum, the vice principal of an Islamic school. Mr. Anjum, his eyes obscured by sunglasses, was not from the neighborhood, but was a Muslim and spoke with authority.\n\"We've come from God,\" he announced as he stepped into the small, cluttered home of Navir Ahmed, a bottle scavenger. \"You should give the children drops. The government only wants good for you.\"\nMr. Ahmed snapped back, \"If you give drops for one disease, you create others.\"\n\"Polio is the kind of disease with no treatment,\" the vice principal replied.\nThe two continued talking past each other until Mr. Ahmed ordered Mr. Anjum out: \"You people keep coming. I don't like it. Go!\"\nAs the team walked on, a growing band of children with dusty hair and ragged clothes trailed behind them, the patter of bare feet echoing in the narrow lanes. At the back of the pack was Sajana, 9, a forlorn shadow of a girl with a bedraggled ponytail, her withered leg and jerky limp a reminder of the virus that lurked in the muck.\nBig Money, but Also Skepticism\nThe world has donated billions of dollars for polio eradication. Japan and Great Britain have given more than $250 million, and Canada, the Netherlands, the European Commission and the World Bank each have given more than $100 million. Far and away the biggest donors have been the United States and Rotary International, which initiated the \"gift to the 21st century\" idea. Each has given more than $500 million.\nBut as the polio campaign has dragged on, the voices of skeptics have grown louder. Dr. Donald A. Henderson, renowned for leading the successful war on smallpox, and currently a professor of medicine and public health at the University of Pittsburgh, said he believed the polio campaign was all but doomed. He suspects that the official caseload figures on www.polioeradication.org are incomplete and that the World Health Organization may not actually know every pocket of virus in the world.\nBut even if it does, and even if all the world's polio cases can be wiped out, he argued, problems that are now being nearly ignored in the all-out effort to corral the last few cases will suddenly loom large. For example, as a precaution, vaccination must be continued for many years after the last case is found, polio experts agree. (Nearly every American child is still immunized -- albeit with a killed vaccine given by injection -- even though polio was virtually wiped out in the United States in the 1960's.)\nBut in about one in three million doses, the live oral vaccine used in poor countries can mutate back into a wild-type virus that can infect and paralyze victims. They are used, however, because they give better immunity than the killed vaccine and are easier to administer.\nA tiny number of healthy people with a rare immune-system defect can keep excreting polio virus for decades -- creating a reservoir that could, theoretically, cause a new outbreak many years in the future. (That is what happened in an unusual case last year in an Amish community in Minnesota where some had refused vaccinations.)\nDr. David L. Heymann, of the World Health Organization, acknowledged the concerns, but said the problems were not insurmountable. For example, the use of oral vaccine could be discontinued after eradication to avoid its mutation into a wild form, he said.\nThrough the years -- as experts have sparred over strategy -- thousands of Rotary volunteers have never lost faith in the prize of eradication. And they have spread their fervor into the American heartland. Dave Groner, a funeral home director from Dowagiac, Mich., and his wife, Barbara, a retired schoolteacher, have led seven teams of volunteers to India and Nigeria to help out in vaccination campaigns. On a recent trip to India, a hog farmer, a psychologist, married real estate brokers and a retired obstetrician were among those who went along.\nAnn Lee Hussey, an animal medical technician from Maine who had polio as a child, got down on the floor with one little girl, and compared their deformed feet.\n\"The girl ran her hand on Ann's foot and scars and all the other kids scooted up,\" Mr. Groner recalled. \"No one snapped photos. Everyone swallowed their Adam's apple.\"\nThousands of such volunteers have offered testimonials at club meetings back home and constitute an extraordinary grass-roots network of fund-raisers. When $93,000 was needed for balloons, whistles and other materials for an immunization campaign in the north Indian state of Bihar, Mr. Groner sent an urgent e-mail plea. In 72 hours, he had pledges for $115,000.\n'A Load on My Heart'\nSuccess is tantalizingly close in India, but still too late for those like Amitkumar whose daily torments are a testament to polio's cruelty. A brainy, square-jawed 15-year-old, he has been paralyzed from the waist down since he was a year-old baby whose plump, sturdy legs steadily wasted away.\nAt 11:30 one morning at the Amar Jyoti School in New Delhi, the bell rang for recess and rambunctious children -- both able-bodied and disabled -- went out to play. Amit, on crutches, swung his shrunken legs at high speed, using his broad chest and shoulders to propel himself. He balanced on legs of skin and bones, held stiff and straight by heavy braces.\nHe has since childhood suffered the taunts of \"cripple,\" and toughened himself to play cricket with neighborhood children. He positioned himself smack in the middle of the field this day. As a ball flew by, he lifted his powerful hand, big as a catcher's mitt, to pluck it from the air.\nThat afternoon, his father, Jaganath, a genial railway worker with a big belly, picked him up at the bus stop on a rusty old bicycle. The son rode sidesaddle, his legs dangling over the back wheel. Mr. Jaganath confided that he was never at peace because of his eldest son's suffering.

The hypnotic rhythms of Bhangra music fill the room.\nThis is Southall, a suburb 10 miles west of Central London known as the city's most authentic \"Little India.\" A patchwork of Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and Afghans pack the streets of a community that settled here 50 years ago, when a British businessman hired large numbers of Punjabi Sikhs to work in his rubber factory.\nLondon has long been known for its vibrant South Asian community and for attracting some of India's top chefs.

Dishes range from \u00a31.50 for starters to main courses at \u00a32.75 to \u00a36.95. The specialty here is Chicken 65 (\u00a34.50), a dish made with chicken prepared in red chili powder, masala and ginger paste, lightly fried to a red-brick hue and topped with onions.

The food belies the sparse appearance at Rita's, where customers place their orders at the counter and sit at long wooden tables, often filled with people eating family style. Rita's is known for much more than just samosas, the flaky, triangular snack or starter usually filled with minced meat or vegetables. Its Alu Tikki Chaat starter (\u00a32), a sweet and spicy dish made with chickpeas, onions, potatoes and yogurt is also a favorite. Most dishes at Rita's are priced from \u00a34.25 to \u00a35.75, and the samosas go for 40 pence each. Don't be surprised to see utensils go untouched here - many regulars use bread to scoop the food with their hands, a common practice in South Asia. \nReligion is also never far from the Southall experience. The neighborhood has Sikh and Hindu temples, along with several mosques and churches. The Vishwa Hindu Mandir, a Hindu temple just off the Broadway on 2 Lady Margaret Road, is worth a stop. The main sanctuary is like a spiritual diorama - a carpeted room and with gilded molding and a gated stage, where child-size statues of Hindu gods stand wearing sparkling robes, jewelry and crowns. Worshippers methodically ring a brass bell, kneel before the statues, and then pour fresh milk on top of one as an offering.

    "text": "They're Rounding the First Turn! And the Favorite Is\n2006-01-17T05:00:00.000Z\nCALCUTTA - The great race of the 21st century is under way between China and India to see which will be the leading power in the world in the year 2100.\nPresident Bush's trip to India next month is important, for we in America must brace ourselves to see not only China looming in our rear-view mirror, but eventually India as well. India was the world's great disappointment of the 20th century, but now it's moving jerkily forward with economic reforms, reminding me of China around 1990.\nOne of India's (and China's) greatest strengths is its hunger for education. Most American newspapers lure readers with comics, and some British tabloids with photos of topless women, but a Calcutta daily newspaper is so shameless that it publishes a column on math equations. Imagine titillating readers with trigonometry!\nI visited the ramshackle Hasi Khusi Kindergarten and Primary School in a poor area of Calcutta, where most of the pupils' parents are illiterate street vendors, rickshaw drivers or laborers. Out of an average family income of $23 a month, the parents pay a one-time fee of $13 for registration and then $2.30 a month.\n\"What they didn't get, their children must get,\" explained the principal, Sampa Sarkar. Even kindergartners study English, Bengali, math, art and music -- and do 30 minutes of homework. Private schools like this one are booming all across the country.\nWith India's ever-deepening pool of English speakers, its outsourcing boom will continue. Your next employment contract may be prepared by an Indian law firm, your mutual fund advised by Indian analysts -- and if you need elective surgery, you may get it at a luxurious Indian hospital that will let foreigners combine their medical care with a recuperative vacation in Agra or Goa.\nIndia has a solid financial system, while China's banking system is a catastrophe. And India is in better shape demographically for long-term growth: China has already reaped most of the economic benefits of population control and is now rapidly aging, but India's population will be disproportionately working-age for many decades to come (a factor that strongly correlates with economic growth).\nIndia's democracy, free press and civil society also provide a measure of political stability. Sure, India can erupt, as it did with the slaughter of Muslims in Gujarat in 2002. But the risks of social and political explosions in India are declining, while in China they may be rising.\nChina will probably manage its eventual transition to democracy with bearable turbulence, as Taiwan and South Korea did, but with China anything is conceivable, including a coup d'\u00e9tat, mass unrest or even civil war.\nYet if democracy is one of India's strengths, it's also a weakness. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh knows exactly what to do, and I've rarely met a leader more competent (or less charismatic). But his reforms are stalled or slowed in the Indian political labyrinth. India's basic problem is that its economic policy-making isn't nearly as shrewd, pro-growth or farsighted as China's.\nThat's a tragedy: we should all want India to demonstrate that democracy is an advantage. But Indian lawmakers aren't helping.\nForeigners are still blocked from directly investing in some sectors in India, like retailing. Privatization is lethargic. Food subsidies are soaring and are so inefficient that it costs 6.6 rupees to transfer 1 rupee's worth of food to the poor. Restrictive labor laws mean that companies hesitate to hire, and regulations tend to suffocate entrepreneurship.\nThe upshot is that India has enjoyed a boom that has added few jobs. Only about one million people work in technology, and manufacturing, which could absorb tens of millions of poor rural laborers, trails even Bangladesh. The losers are India's poor.\nAnd while China has been exceptionally shrewd in upgrading its infrastructure, India has been pathetic. India's economic future is marred by its third-rate roads and ports.\nIndia is also horrendously mismanaging its AIDS crisis; it may already have more H.I.V. cases than any country in the world. AIDS casts a cloud over this nation's entire future.\nThe bottom line is that the once-great nation of India is reawakening from several centuries of torpor, and facing less risk of a political cataclysm than China. India is poised to again be a great world power.\nBut over all, my bet is that China will still grow faster and win the race of the century. I'm going to tell my kids to keep studying Chinese, rather than switch to Hindi.",

    "text": "U.S. Court Orders City to Ensure Aid for Battered Immigrants\n2006-08-30T05:00:00.000Z\nA federal judge yesterday ordered the city to stop illegally denying food stamps and other aid to battered immigrant women and children and to overhaul the error-plagued computer programs and training manuals that continue to lead welfare workers to turn them away.\nThe judge determined that high-level city policymakers had long been aware of the systemic problems, but did little or nothing to fix them until a group of battered women filed a lawsuit late last year. As a result, if the city and state continue to fight the lawsuit, the judge said, he will be highly likely to find them liable for \"deliberate indifference\" to violations of the plaintiffs' federal and state rights.\n\"It is not the policy of the United States, nor of the State of New York, to leave destitute the battered immigrant wives and children of lawful U.S. residents just because their abusive husbands are no longer supporting them or providing them with a basis for obtaining aid,\" the judge, Jed S. Rakoff of United States District Court in Manhattan, wrote in his 83-page decision. He certified the lawsuit as a class action and issued a preliminary injunction against the city and state.\nThe judge commended the city for fixing some of the problems since February, when he issued a partial injunction and held nine days of hearings in the case. But he added that problems persisted because of inadequate training, poor computer design and faulty directives.\n\"The simple truth, moreover, is that the ameliorative actions now taken by the city and state defendants would not likely have been taken if this lawsuit had not been brought and had the court not issued its initial injunction,\" he wrote.\nThe decision is awkward for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who is preparing to unveil a plan for attacking poverty in the city, a central goal of his second term. The plan is expected to focus on children, young adults and the working poor.\nJane Tobey Momo, senior counsel for the city, said officials were reviewing the opinion to determine the city's next steps. \"While we are disappointed in the court's findings,\" she wrote in a statement, \"we are pleased that the court recognized and commended the city for the extensive recent steps taken to ameliorate the difficulties in delivering benefits to noncitizen immigrants.\n\"The difficult and changing federal and state statutes, regulations and policies present continuing challenges to the process,\" she added.\nWhen the lawsuit was filed in December by the New York Legal Assistance Group and the Legal Aid Society, the lawyers called it a last resort, saying that officials had failed to fix problems that forced hundreds of women to choose between staying safe and feeding their families, despite government policies aimed at supporting them until they can get on their feet.\nThe suit seeks back benefits that range from a few hundred dollars to one or two thousand dollars per family in the class. \"That represents months of being able to get by,\" said Ronald Abramson, a partner at Hughes Hubbard & Reed, which worked on the case for months without charge, but is now likely to be able to collect more than a million dollars in legal fees from the city.\nAbout a dozen plaintiffs, mostly identified only by initials, include a woman from Senegal helping to prosecute the man accused of torturing her and murdering her sister; a Mexican mother of two whose husband chased her with a gun; and a Bangladeshi woman whose husband, since hospitalized for mental illness, kicked her in the abdomen while she was pregnant, cut up her clothes and threatened to kill her when she tried to go to work.\nSeveral fled to domestic violence shelters, only to find themselves unable to buy food or medicine for their children. In an affidavit, one breast-feeding mother wrote of going hungry and of feeling powerless as she and her young children lost weight.\nThe abuse, documented in orders of protection, police reports and letters from domestic violence shelters, was not in question. Nor was eligibility for aid, often affirmed through administrative \"fair hearings,\" only to be denied again or automatically cut off.\nOne of the basic problems lay in the pull-down computer menu that caseworkers used when entering information about a noncitizen applying for aid. The list of eligible immigration categories mistakenly omitted \"battered qualified alien,\" the category in which these women and children fit.\nThat problem was fixed recently, after Judge Rakoff's February order, but other deficiencies remain. The judge called the violations \"the direct results of the flawed design of the city's computer system, the pervasive errors in the city's training materials and policy directives, and the widespread worker ignorance resulting from inadequate training of the city's employees.\"\n\"The Court readily concludes that, given the pervasive and systemic nature of the various problems resulting in the unlawful denial of benefits to plaintiffs, plaintiffs have established a very high likelihood that the city will be found liable on all the plaintiffs claims,\" he wrote.\nIn 45 pages devoted to legal findings, he determined that the plaintiffs had established \"an overwhelming likelihood of success on their contention that the city, in its failure to adequately train its employees, was 'deliberately indifferent' to the violation of plaintiffs' federal rights.\" He added that the state was \"vicariously liable\" because it supervises the city's provision of public aid and had failed to change its own programming problems and faulty directives.\nJason Brown, a spokesman for Gov. George E. Pataki, said state officials would not comment until they review the decision.\nMr. Abramson said even last winter, when the judge ordered the city to provide aid to the named plaintiffs, the city's lawyers returned to court saying their efforts had been stymied because the computer system \"errored-out\" many of the cases.\nBut eventually all the families involved in the lawsuit received aid, said Caroline Jane Hickey, a lawyer with New York Legal Assistance Group. \"We are thrilled with Judge Rakoff's decision to protect the rights of a population with almost no voice,\" she said.\nShe cited the case of the Mexican mother identified as J.Z. in the lawsuit, who has since been able to move into public housing in the Bronx with her two children. She has passed a high school equivalency test and found a job at her children's school.\n\"She has managed to completely turn her life around,\" Ms. Hickey said. \"She plans to be a nurse.\"",

    "text": "The hard truth behind Asia's boom - Editorials & Commentary - International Herald Tribune\n2006-08-22T05:00:00.000Z\nMANILA \u2014 Fighting poverty\nBehind the news of Asia's booming economies, vast pockets of persistent and paralyzing poverty remain. China raised eyebrows around the world with 11.3 percent growth in the second quarter of this year, but 42 percent of all Chinese continue to live on the equivalent of less than $2 a day. In India, three-quarters of the population - more than 800 million people - survive each day on less than the cost of a Starbucks latte.\nAll told, almost 1.9 billion people, or 60 percent of all Asians, still live in poverty. But Asia's deep and rapid economic expansion creates an opportunity for a sharper focus on eliminating the roots of poverty. Education and health are critical areas where the state must take the lead. Many Asian governments are well placed to make decisions that could lead millions of their people out of desperate situations.\nHealth-related shocks are among the most common events pushing people into poverty, and education is one of the most important stepping stones out of chronic want. Making education and health care available to the poor can, over time, position them to capitalize on opportunities to enter the formal economy and help close the wide gap between rich and poor. Countries that create this kind of \"inclusive\" growth beat poverty and build political and social stability.\nTo address social inequalities that hinder poverty reduction, three factors must come into play. First, policy makers and civil society must commit to improving primary health care and basic education for the poor, not only in rhetoric but also in practice.\nIt is hard to find anyone who doesn't believe children should be healthy and in school. But the picture on the ground in much of Asia is disturbing. In many countries, child-mortality rates for the poor are two to three times higher than those for the rich; primary-school age children from poorer households are almost three times more likely to be out of school than those from richer households. Larger numbers of children are being left behind.\nThe picture in India is particularly startling. Almost half of all Indian children below the age of five are underweight. Infant and child mortality rates are higher than in Bangladesh and Nepal. More surprisingly, India's level of child malnutrition is higher than that in sub-Saharan Africa.\nSecond, countries must examine why education and health services are not available to, or not being used by, the poor, and design policies and remedies based on country-specific evidence and experience.\nBoth supply- and demand-side constraints could be hampering improvement. On the supply side, a lack of focus on serving poor communities may be a key challenge. The poor often lack political power, and their needs often fall down the list of priorities as a result. In such cases, change will likely be needed at the institutional level to establish and maintain elementary education and basic health policies that mandate equal access.

    "text": "A Spoonful of Foreign Culture Helps Western Medicine Go Down\n2006-06-04T04:00:00.000Z\nWhen officials at Brooklyn's Maimonides Medical Center were preparing a new clinic in Sunset Park in April, everything was ready for the big opening day except the big opening day itself. \n\"One of our staff members told us it was an unlucky date,\" said Pamela S. Brier, the hospital's chief executive. \"We had to change it.\"\nSo the ribbon-cutting, originally scheduled for April 24, was moved to the following day. It was a difference of only 24 hours, but all the difference in the world to the Chinese immigrants the clinic was largely built to serve, who believed the 25th to be a more auspicious date.\nIt was one of the many ways in which the $1 million clinic was carefully designed to cater to Sunset Park's fast-growing Chinese population, one of the largest in the city. \nBecause the color white is associated with death in China, the walls are mostly painted in yellow and pink tones. And because Chinese immigrants have high rates of tuberculosis infection, every patient is tested for it. The chefs in the main hospital's kosher kitchen have learned to prepare rice porridge, a beloved Chinese comfort food. \"Language, culture, food \u0097 it's all tremendously important,\" Ms. Brier said.\nThe new clinic is Maimonides's most ambitious effort to respond to a growing and increasingly diverse population of immigrant patients. It also reflects a broader national shift in health care as urban hospitals move beyond the translation services that started becoming common in the late 1990's and acknowledge that language is not the only barrier they face in treating people from all over the globe. \nSome come from cultures that are broadly skeptical of Western medicine, and prefer the herbs and poultices of traditional healers, \"cures\" that in some cases can retard the effects of prescribed medicines or produce dangerous interactions. Others come from cultures where they are expected to hide sickness from strangers, or where it might be offensive for male doctors to examine female patients.\n\"It's been a slow trend to develop because it's not always clear to a hospital how big a certain community might be, and sometimes it takes a couple of years to manifest,\" said Rick Wade, a senior vice president of the American Hospital Association. But now, he said, programs are appearing everywhere, to strengthen what hospitals call \"cultural competency.\" \nAt Oakwood Hospital in heavily Arab Dearborn, Mich., nurses are trained to point the beds of Muslim patients toward Mecca. In Glendale, Calif., which had a rapid influx of Armenian immigrants during the 1990's, one hospital sponsors a popular health-related call-in show that is broadcast in Armenian on cable-access television.\nBut challenges can be more varied and daunting for hospitals in places like Brooklyn, home to insular communities of Orthodox Jews, Muslims from conservative Arab countries, recent immigrants from rural China and Hispanics from Central and South America, among many others. \n\"In each culture that we're dealing with, there are different ideas, family values and beliefs, whether about medicine or life in general,\" said Virginia Tong, a vice president at Lutheran Medical Center, one of south Brooklyn's largest health care providers. \"Let's say you had an Hispanic godparent who brought a patient in to see a doctor. In this country, we would say, 'That's not a parent;' there might be legal issues. But in their culture, godparents are almost as important as parents.\"\nLutheran's main hospital has a mosque on site; it also runs clinics aimed at Caribbean and Korean immigrants. In 2001, Lutheran opened its own Chinese clinic, on Eighth Avenue in Sunset Park, after a survey showed that most Chinese immigrants in the area were going to Chinatown in Manhattan for medical care.\nMaimonides, long known as \"the Jewish hospital,\" in Ms. Brier's words, has in recent years customized the care at many of its 15 clinics, which are around southwest Brooklyn, based on the cultures and needs of the patients each serves. \nThe doctors at the hospital's Newkirk Avenue clinic, for example, see many Indian immigrants, who have disproportionately high rates of hypertension. Its pediatricians also see many children born in Bangladesh. Because infants there are often not immunized against measles, as most babies are in the United States, that means more effort devoted to vaccination and extra care in reporting cases to public health officials to contain any outbreaks.\nBut the hospital's outreach to Chinese immigrants is its biggest, driven by what its officials believe will be continued population growth in south Brooklyn. \"We go where the patients are,\" Ms. Brier said. \nMaimonides opened its first Sunset Park clinic in a brownstone building in 1996. Within three years, doctors there were seeing 9,000 patients a year, including a growing number of Chinese. The number of patients has doubled since, prompting the latest move from a storefront space to a 10,000-square-foot building on Seventh Avenue and 64th Street.\nThe attending doctors there speak Mandarin or Cantonese, two major Chinese dialects. About 70 percent of the patients are Chinese, according to Dr. Bing Lu, the clinic's medical director, and a significant number are recent arrivals to the United States. Many hold the traditional belief, he said, that drawing blood for tests drains a person's life force, and they are reluctant to allow it. \n\"We teach them that they need it,\" he added, relying on the staff members' language skills and familiarity with Chinese culture to reduce patients' suspicion. \"Generally speaking, Chinese people don't believe in preventative care.\"\nSuch an attitude can be deadly. A few years ago, doctors at the clinic found early signs of liver cancer in a man in his 30's who was infected with hepatitis B. The man left the clinic, Dr. Lu said, and did not return the clinic's phone calls. When he finally came back six months later, he was jaundiced and underweight, with a severely enlarged liver. The cancer had advanced beyond the possibility of life-prolonging surgery. \nIt was \"a fatal mistake,\" said Dr. Lu, who believes the man at first sought out traditional healers instead of returning to the clinic.\nSeveral patients praised the doctors' warmth and staff members' willingness to help them with paperwork. Susan Lin, 31, who emigrated from China's Fujian Province five years ago, said, through an interpreter: \"Sometimes we're afraid to ask questions, to ask how to follow up. Here, they always smile, they are always welcoming. You feel very comfortable asking questions.\"\nRecently, an 80-year-old woman arrived at the clinic just before closing time, asking to see a doctor. She said it was urgent, but when examined she would say only that she had been unable to sleep for about a week. \nUnder careful questioning, Dr. Lu said, she eventually revealed that her husband had died the previous week, and that she had been crying and having anxiety attacks, details that a Chinese woman her age might consider inappropriate to admit. \n\"When you know the culture, you know it's normal, but if you don't, as a practitioner, you can miss a significant problem,\" Dr. Lu said. \"She could easily have been turned away from the clinic that day.\"",

    "text": "Where others flee, Orascom fights\n2006-02-12T05:00:00.000Z\n\nCAIRO \u2014 From an office on the 26th floor of his family's golden-domed twin towers, overlooking the Nile, Naguib Sawiris, chief executive of Orascom Telecom, scans the world for opportunities to expand his telecommunications empire.\nHe tends to find them in places others fear to tread.\nTake, for instance, Orascom's $160 million investment in Iraqna. The first mobile phone provider in Iraq, Iraqna operates in the volatile central provinces of Baghdad, Anbar and Diyala. Its employees have been kidnapped and its outlets have been attacked, pushing the company's annual security costs to $30 million.\nBut two years after it started service, Iraqna has 1.5 million subscribers, or 41 percent of the Iraqi market. In the first nine months of 2005, the company generated $249 million in revenue.\n\"Wherever the risk is high, the profits are also high,\" said Sawiris, the 50-year-old son of an Egyptian construction magnate. \"We have created a value of two to three billion dollars in Iraq by just being there for two years, and soon we will reach two million subscribers in our network.\"\nThe only major difference between doing business in Iraq and any other place in the world, said Sawiris, is having to negotiate with kidnappers.\n\"We know that calm will come one day and Iraq will be a second Saudi Arabia,\" Sawiris said. \"In the mobile telecom business, we invest where the service is needed and we can create value. You cannot be really choosy.\"\nIraqna is just one example of a drive by Orascom Telecom into emerging markets in Asia and the Middle East. The company has a total subscriber base of 30 million people in Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Tunisia and Zimbabwe, among other countries.\nThose countries represent a market of 460 million people, but on average only 11.5 percent of their populations have mobile phones, leaving room for high growth. In 2005, the company more than doubled its subscriber base, and it is on target to reach 50 million subscribers by the end of 2006.\nOrascom's net income was $298 million in 2004, up 184 percent from 2003. Income in the first half of 2005 was $296 million, up 49 percent from the same period a year earlier. The company had debt of $1.5 billion in June 2005, which is considered relatively low for a mobile phone company.\nSawiris said he approached each market the same way: Quick decision making and network building. The Coalition Provisional Authority, the U.S.-led civil administration in Iraq, awarded Orascom Telecom a two-year operation license in 2003. Sawiris embarked on a network construction spree, an intensive advertising campaign and the dotting of Iraqi cities with exclusive distributor outlets.\n\"He has the companies that deploy the network,\" said Wael Zaida, a senior analyst with EFG Hermes, a brokerage house. \"He has the companies that provide the handsets. All he needed is a license to start operations.\"\n\"Despite the high risk involved in putting an operation in Iraq, it is the Iraqi operation that has been doing fantastically well,\" Zaida said.\nOrascom has weathered its share of reversals, and Sawiris admits to having made some mistakes. He says that his business partner in Syria, a cousin of President Bashar al-Assad, took over the partnership for his own benefit, prompting Orascom to pull up its stake and arbitrate the dispute in Australia, where Orascom settled for $20 million.\nAfter similar problems in Yemen, Sawiris decided he would never again enter into partnerships with those who have close ties with a country's leadership.\nOrascom moved into 22 countries between 1999 and 2002, but that rapid expansion led to ballooning short-term debt. Sawiris decided to sell most of Orascom's African holdings as well as its Jordanian subsidiary, Fastlink, even though it had been performing remarkably well.\nBut the gamble paid off. Today, most of Orascom's revenue comes from Algeria, Egypt and Pakistan. Sales increased 93 percent last year, to $2 billion, while net income nearly tripled to $298.\nIn May, Sawiris moved into the European market, paying E3 billion, or $3.6 billion, to take control of Wind, one of the leading phone companies in Italy.\n 1 \n2\nNext Page \u00bb\n",

    "text": "Fighting poverty: The hard truth behind Asia's boom - Editorials & Commentary - International Herald Tribune\n2006-08-22T05:00:00.000Z\nMANILA \u2014 Behind the news of Asia's booming economies, vast pockets of persistent and paralyzing poverty remain. China raised eyebrows around the world with 11.3 percent growth in the second quarter of this year, but 42 percent of all Chinese continue to live on the equivalent of less than $2 a day. In India, three-quarters of the population - more than 800 million people - survive each day on less than the cost of a Starbucks latte.\nAll told, almost 1.9 billion people, or 60 percent of all Asians, still live in poverty. But Asia's deep and rapid economic expansion creates an opportunity for a sharper focus on eliminating the roots of poverty. Education and health are critical areas where the state must take the lead. Many Asian governments are well placed to make decisions that could lead millions of their people out of desperate situations.\nHealth-related shocks are among the most common events pushing people into poverty, and education is one of the most important stepping stones out of chronic want. Making education and health care available to the poor can, over time, position them to capitalize on opportunities to enter the formal economy and help close the wide gap between rich and poor. Countries that create this kind of \"inclusive\" growth beat poverty and build political and social stability.\nTo address social inequalities that hinder poverty reduction, three factors must come into play. First, policy makers and civil society must commit to improving primary health care and basic education for the poor, not only in rhetoric but also in practice.\nIt is hard to find anyone who doesn't believe children should be healthy and in school. But the picture on the ground in much of Asia is disturbing. In many countries, child-mortality rates for the poor are two to three times higher than those for the rich; primary-school age children from poorer households are almost three times more likely to be out of school than those from richer households. Larger numbers of children are being left behind.\nThe picture in India is particularly startling. Almost half of all Indian children below the age of five are underweight. Infant and child mortality rates are higher than in Bangladesh and Nepal. More surprisingly, India's level of child malnutrition is higher than that in sub-Saharan Africa.\nSecond, countries must examine why education and health services are not available to, or not being used by, the poor, and design policies and remedies based on country-specific evidence and experience.\nBoth supply- and demand-side constraints could be hampering improvement. On the supply side, a lack of focus on serving poor communities may be a key challenge. The poor often lack political power, and their needs often fall down the list of priorities as a result. In such cases, change will likely be needed at the institutional level to establish and maintain elementary education and basic health policies that mandate equal access. Countries like Sri Lanka and Vietnam have succeeded in directing funds to promote access for the poor and now see low enrollment inequalities.\nOn the demand side, individual household situations - such as the parents' level of education and income - are more important than access to a school in determining whether a child actually attends classes. Evidence from India suggests ethnicity and caste are also important factors.\nAsia's experience offers some solutions. Carefully targeted programs such as conditional cash transfers, food-for-education programs, midday meal programs, school health services and scholarships for girls are highly effective in getting poor kids in school and keeping them there.\nThird, once the challenge is clearly identified and the best remedies are selected, policy makers must be held responsible for making the solutions work. The public will need to hold the government accountable for ensuring that funds allocated to pro- poor education and health programs actually reach poor communities and are spent wisely.\nEvidence from Asia shows overwhelmingly that economic growth has the greatest impact on poverty reduction in educated populations with lower levels of income inequality.

    "text": "At Davos, 'the world' means the West\n2006-01-29T05:00:00.000Z\n\nDAVOS \u2014 The annual meeting of the World Economic Forum is a poor reflection of the world. But it is a useful mirror of the West's received wisdom about the world.\nThis year the main theme, in conversations as well as in formal sessions, was shock and awe at the economic growth of China and India and their impact on everything from copper prices to the global motor industry to office jobs in North America. A mix of admiration and fear accompanied this vision of two Asian elephants threatening to invade Western pastures.\nThe likes of Google paraded the obsequious inclinations of Western companies still dreaming of vast profits from the land of a billion people. But this was not accompanied by much willingness to accord the non-Western world more say in the way the world is run, whether at the International Monetary Fund or in determining how to respond to the desires of Iran to assert its rights to nuclear development.\nThe obsession with China and India was, to this observer at least, rather bizarre. Both have been growing apace - albeit it as different speeds - and gradually integrating into the world economy for more than a decade. Nothing much has happened of late to suggest that a critical mass has just been reached which must cause the West to feel panicky. Both may continue to grow rapidly for two more decades. That will change the balance of economic power in the world. But what's new about that?\nMost striking at Davos was the lack of representation of the East Asian countries that have done most to alter that balance of power over the past 40 years - and continue to do so. The economies of Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have spawned the companies that have challenged Western domination of almost every industry. These are the companies that account for most of the products being exported from China, be they shoes, toys or laptops.\nThe low profile at Davos of these East Asian innovators and of their cousins from prospering Southeast Asia, who collectively own of $1.5 trillion in Western debt, stood in sharp contrast to the India/China obsession. So too did the absence of countries such as Indonesia, Bangladesh and Thailand.\nPerhaps the representation was skewed because this year Davos - whose dates are decided by the organizers - coincided with the Lunar New Year, when half of East Asia is totally closed and the rest operates at half speed. Perhaps it was because of tight-fisted attitudes on the part of Asian companies and governments that do not regard the World Economic Forum's annual fest as a good investment.\nWhatever the cause, the result was unfortunate.\nA discussion of the future of the global financial architecture, for example, fielded the established Western luminaries - Jean-Claude Trichet of the European Central Bank, Rodrigo de Rato of the International Monetary Fund, Andrew Crockett, formerly of the Bank for International Settlements and now with JP Morgan, and Timothy Geithner, head of the New York Federal Reserve. But in the absence of any of the Asian owners of most of the world's foreign exchange reserves, debate was minimal. Indeed, without the presence of Noriel Roubini, a sparky academic from New York known for his expertise on the Asian crisis, there would have been no debate at all, just a grudging acceptance that some changes at the margin the way the financial world is run were necessary.\nA discussion on Iran involved Americans, Brits and one very open minded Iranian academic. The Westerners took it as read that \"the world\" was worried about Iran and determined to bring it to heel. The phrase \"the international community\" - code for received Western opinion - was on parade. That was the sort of position that could only be sustained by not having any Indians or Chinese, let alone Arabs, Africans or Brazilians, on the panel. It is easy to be sure when you think you are the world, even if you simultaneously fear the emergence of new economic powers.\nThere was what promised to be a very interesting and necessary session drawing attention to the pandemic of chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension, which are shortening tens of millions of lives, particularly in the developing world. But with experts and audience alike almost all from the West, the discussion never progressed much beyond marginal issues in North America and Europe such as soft drinks and junk food in schools.\nDavos does provide many opportunities to meet, to discuss, to learn, even to initiate. Africa generally gets a slightly better hearing than at most international gatherings. But it badly needs to change its list of panelists if it is to be more than a window on trans-Atlantic thinking.\n",

    "text": "Billy Preston, 59, Soul Musician, Is Dead; Renowned Keyboardist and Collaborator\n2006-06-07T04:00:00.000Z\nBilly Preston, the splashy gospel-rooted keyboardist whose career included No. 1 solo hits and work with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, died yesterday in Scottsdale, Ariz. He was 59. \nHe died after having been in a coma since November, his manager, Joyce Moore, told The Associated Press. He had voluntarily entered a drug rehabilitation clinic in Malibu, Calif., and suffered pericarditis there, leading to respiratory failure that left him in a coma. \nMr. Preston had an extensive career as a sideman, working with musicians from Little Richard to the Red Hot Chili Peppers. His own hits included the Grammy-winning instrumental \"Outa-Space\" in 1972 and the No. 1 pop singles \"Will It Go Round in Circles\" (1973) and \"Nothing From Nothing\" (1974). He also wrote (with Bruce Fisher) the ubiquitous \"You Are So Beautiful.\" \nBut his best-known performance was the afternoon he spent on a London rooftop with the Beatles in what was their last concert, which was filmed for \"Let It Be.\" In a 2001 interview, he recalled, \"They made me feel like a member of the band.\" \nWilliam Everett Preston was born in Houston on Sept. 2, 1946, and grew up in Los Angeles. He was a child prodigy who accompanied the gospel singer Mahalia Jackson when he was 10. In 1958, he played the young W. C. Handy in the film biography \"St. Louis Blues.\" Little Richard hired Mr. Preston for a European tour in 1962, and during that tour Mr. Preston met the fledgling Beatles \u2014 who were Little Richard's opening act \u2014 as well as Sam Cooke, who hired Mr. Preston for his band and signed him to his own label, SAR Records. After Mr. Cooke's death, Mr. Preston began recording instrumental albums with titles like \"The Wildest Organ in Town\" (1965) and \"The Most Exciting Organ Ever\" (1966). \nHe worked in the house band of the pop TV show \"Shindig,\" then joined Ray Charles' band for three years. George Harrison of the Beatles saw him with Charles' band, and brought him to work with the Beatles. \nMr. Preston was signed to the Beatles' label, Apple, and made two albums produced by Harrison: \"That's the Way God Planned It\" and \"Encouraging Words.\" He was invited to join the recording sessions that yielded \"Let It Be\" and \"Abbey Road,\" where he helped hold together the band. \"It was a struggle for them,\" Mr. Preston said in 2001. \"They were kind of despondent. They had lost the joy of doing it all.\" \nThe Beatles' 1969 single of \"Get Back\" is credited to \"The Beatles With Billy Preston,\" the only shared label credit in the Beatles' own career. Mr. Preston appeared at the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh that Mr. Harrison organized, and did studio work on solo projects by Mr. Harrison, John Lennon and Ringo Starr. \nMr. Preston's own career flourished in the early 1970's, when he had his major hits: synthesizer-topped instrumentals (\"Outa-Space\" and \"Space Race\") and jaunty soul songs (\"Will It Go Round in Circles\" and \"Nothing From Nothing\"). He worked in the studio with the Rolling Stones on their 1970's albums, among them \"Sticky Fingers\" and \"Exile on Main Street,\" and toured with them. He was also a studio musician on Sly and the Family Stone's \"There's a Riot Goin' On\" and on Bob Dylan's \"Blood on the Tracks.\" \nMr. Preston was the musical guest on the first \"Saturday Night Live,\" broadcast in 1975. He appeared in the 1978 Beatles-inspired film \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" as Sergeant Pepper In 1979 he had a hit duet with the singer Syreeta Wright, \"With You I'm Born Again.\" \nHe continued working as a studio sideman and making solo albums through the 1980's, and he toured with Ringo Starr's All-Starr Band in 1989. But a longtime drug problem caught up with him in 1992, when he pleaded no contest to charges of assault and cocaine possession and spent nine months at a drug rehabilitation center. He made gospel albums during the 1990's, including \"Minister of Music\" in 1995 and \"Words and Music,\" with Edna Tatum, in 1996. In 1997 he was sentenced to three years in prison for violating probation, and in 1998 he pleaded guilty to insurance fraud. \nAfter Mr. Preston was released from prison, he was welcomed as a musician. He appeared in the movie \"Blues Brothers 2000\" and performed at the 2002 Concert for George, a tribute organized by Eric Clapton a year after Harrison's death. He appears on Mr. Clapton's album \"Me and Mr. Johnson,\" and toured with Mr. Clapton. He was a studio musician on Neil Diamond's \"12 Songs\" and on the current Red Hot Chili Peppers album, \"Stadium Arcadium,\" and he was one of the guests on Ray Charles' final album, \"Genius Loves Company.\" He made a tribute album, \"Billy Preston's Beatles Salute,\" in 2004, and he performed on the season finale of \"American Idol\" in 2005. He played his final recording session in October, for a coming album by Sam Moore of Sam and Dave. \nHe is survived by his sister, Gwen Gooden, and two half sisters, Lettie Preston and Rodena Williams. \n\"When you're doing it you're just trying to do the best you can,\" Mr. Preston said in 2001. \"You don't know if you're doing something important, and whether it will make history has yet to be seen. Just the fact of being able to do it, and striving to do the best you can, was the accomplishment.\" ",

    "text": "Muslim women: Customs and conflicts\n2006-03-28T05:00:00.000Z\n\nMasuda Sultan was 16 when her Afghan parents arranged for her to marry a doctor almost twice her age. She saw him just once before they were ritually joined, when she was 17, in an Islamic nikkah ceremony that was held in a hotel in Flushing, Queens.\nBy her account in her new memoir, \"My War At Home\" (Washington Square Press), the marriage was a blunder from the first. Although Sultan had grown up in New York, before the wedding night her mother asked her to follow an old custom: provide the new in-laws with a blood- stained cloth as evidence of her virginity. Once married, she writes, her husband rarely spoke to her, insisted she remain subservient and discouraged schooling beyond college. After three years, feeling despondent to the point of swallowing a bottle of his Valium, she walked away and returned to her parents' Queens home.\nAnd yet, Sultan, in an interview, said she wrote the book to enlighten outsiders about the virtues of an arranged marriage, like the confidence newlyweds have in a decision by their elders and the domestic bolstering a wife receives from her husband's family.\n\"It's upsetting that people see your culture as backward, who say to me 'You poor victim,'\" she said. \"I think Westerners have a simplistic idea about arranged marriage. Mine didn't work out, but that was not the case for everyone, and it's not necessarily backward to do that.\"\nThat contradiction captures how much Sultan, like many immigrants, oscillates between two worlds, in her case that of a traditional Afghan daughter and an urbane graduate of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government who has ventured to Afghanistan some 10 times to fight for the rights of women. She has great affection for Afghans, but also misgivings about some traditions. That conflict is her memoir's recurring leitmotif.\nIn telling her story, she has joined the growing ranks of Muslim women who are offering an insider's view of Muslim life at a post-9/11 moment when many people are curious, as Sultan says, about \"what drives Muslims, how do they operate behind closed doors.\"\nIn the memoir \"Reading Lolita in Tehran,\" Azar Nafisi describes a women's book club that debates the painful conflicts of living under Islamic law. In the novel \"Brick Lane,\" Monica Ali writes affectingly about a Bangladeshi in London in an arranged marriage whose sister elopes in a \"love marriage.\" And a former Wall Street Journal reporter, Asra Nomani, published \"Standing Alone in Mecca,\" about her pilgrimage to Islam's most holy site last year.\nMore are on their way: Shirin Ebadi, the Nobel Prize-winning Iranian human rights champion, will have a memoir out in May. And Ali's editor, Wendy Walker, is publishing a memoir in the autumn by Mukhtar Mai, the Pakistani woman who was gang- raped by order of a tribal court to avenge her brother's supposed misconduct.\nDavid Ebershoff, an editor at large at Random House who edited Ebadi's book, said that these books have struck a chord with readers because 'the personal is a prism into the larger geopolitical story.\" They also respond to the conflicts of women having to juggle their working lives with more traditional roles of wife and mother - however perilous their experiences might be. In her memoir, Ebadi writes of the night that she was summoned to jail. On the way out the door she tells her daughters to order a pizza for dinner.\nSultan, 27, feels the Islamic faith has been distorted by some believers, often, as with suicide bombings, for political ends. She recalls studying the Koran at an after-school madrassa and \"having it shoved down your throat - the students recite and don't know what it means.\"\n\"But the Prophet Muhammad encouraged questions, encouraged looking at other religions and coming to Islam because you think it is the best religion,\" she said.\nThat is why, in trying to expand rights of Afghan women, she works to unearth what she sees as neglected concepts in Islamic texts - that a woman has a duty to be educated, that she can be paid for housework and that she can negotiate marriage contracts spelling out a husband's obligations.\n 1 \n2\nNext Page \u00bb\n",

    "text": "The Evidence for Global Warming\n2006-07-04T04:00:00.000Z\nWhile the debate over what to do about global warming heats up even faster than the environment, scientists have made substantial progress in recent years in defining the threat and estimating its likely impacts. The picture they paint is worrisome. The evidence suggests that humans are altering the atmosphere in ways never before seen. The only question is how damaging the consequences might be, and what can be done to head off or adapt to the worst. \nThe research requires great sophistication and care because of the complexity of the Earth's climatic system. The world has been in a warming phase since the end of the Little Ice Age, a prolonged cooling period, in the mid-19th century. Scientists have to try to disentangle this natural trend from the additional warming that man is creating by burning fossil fuels that emit heat-trapping greenhouse gases or by cutting down trees that would otherwise remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\nScientists used to think it might take decades before we had a clear signal of man-made global warming. Even then, they thought it would probably be hidden in esoteric data that few laymen could understand. Yet now all sorts of things seem to be happening right in front of our eyes \u2014 shrinking glaciers, thinning sea ice at the North Pole, huge chunks breaking off the Antarctic ice sheets, intense hurricanes, and scorching heat waves in Europe, to name a few. Are these signs that the adverse impacts of human-caused warming have arrived sooner than once expected?\nSkeptics say these things are most likely part of the natural variation of Earth's climate, unrelated to man-made warming. And no definitive answer is yet possible for many of these dramatic events that symbolize the global warming threat in popular discourse. Given the dreadful possibilities that perfectly legitimate worst-case scenarios imply, there would be no excuse for failing to act under any circumstances. But given the huge potential consequence of the debate, it's important to examine all the evidence carefully. So let's look at the various pieces of the global warming debate one at a time. \nThe Consensus\nThe biggest question is the one on which there is least dispute. The leading scientific organizations with relevant expertise have overwhelmingly adopted the view that human-induced global warming is a serious problem. The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which has mobilized hundreds of scientists to analyze the evidence, has gotten progressively more concerned; it now holds humans responsible for most of the warming observed over the past 50 years. The science academies of the United States and 10 other industrial nations issued a joint statement last year citing \"strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring\" and calling for \"prompt action\" to combat it. The American Meteorological Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Geophysical Union have all chimed in with similar statements. Only the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, with deep ties to the fossil fuel industry, has demurred.\nMeanwhile, the vast majority of research reports in leading scientific journals tend to support the prevailing view that human activities are mostly responsible for driving up temperatures. An analysis of 928 abstracts from leading scientific journals between 1993 and 2003 found that about 20 per cent explicitly endorsed that consensus, another 55 per cent implicitly accepted it and went on to evaluate impacts or propose mitigation strategies, and the remaining 25 per cent took no position. Not a single paper disagreed with the consensus. A rebuttal survey by a British social anthropologist found fewer papers that endorsed the consensus and 34 that rejected or doubted it, but that survey in turn was sharply criticized for distorting what the abstracts actually said. \nStill, there is plenty of disagreement over how fast the climate will change and how dire the consequences might be. In Canada, which is having its own climate-change debate, some 60 scientists signed an open letter in April decrying the \"alarmist forecasts\" of the United Nations and suggesting that concern over greenhouse gases should actually be diminishing. They were countered by an open letter from 90 other scientists endorsing the U.N. consensus and calling for a national strategy to deal with climate change. \nScary Scenarios\nAnalyses of the gases trapped in ancient ice cores from Antarctica have revealed that important greenhouse gases have reached their highest atmospheric concentrations in at least 650,000 years. The concentrations will only get worse as cars, power plants and other burners of fossil fuels continue to pump carbon dioxide into the air and deforestation and other changes in land use slow the rate at which these gases are withdrawn from the atmosphere. Other things being equal, the rise in these gases will cause temperatures to rise. That's simple physics, agreed to by all sides.\nWhat's not agreed to is how worrisome the temperature increase will be. The global average surface temperature rose about 1 degree Fahrenheit over the 20th century. The change hardly seemed noticeable, except in polar regions where the increases were larger. Yet even that seemingly small increase is affecting the global environment by thawing the frozen tundra, melting mountain glaciers, adding to stress on coral reefs, causing some species to change habitats, and increasing the number of hot days while decreasing the number of cold days, to cite a few examples. And the warming trend may be picking up speed. The last few decades of the 20th century were probably the warmest in a thousand years. \nSkeptics have an answer for this. They say surface temperatures were probably as high or higher during the Medieval Warm Period\n that ushered in the last millennium, well before humans emitted vast amounts of greenhouse gases. That suggests to them that today's warming might simply be a continuation of long-term natural cycles. But the magnitude and geographic extent of the warmth back then is uncertain. The high temperatures may have been regional and may not have permeated the whole globe. \nAnd for the rest of this century, temperatures will almost certainly keep rising. The Earth has been storing heat in its oceans, which means there is about 1 degree Fahrenheit more warming in the pipeline that will occur during this century even without any additional greenhouse emissions. All major components of the climate system are warming \u2014 the lower atmosphere, the surface, and the seas \u2014 so the heating cannot readily be attributed to natural mechanisms that transfer heat from one part of the globe to another.\nThe projections for the future also get far more worrisome than that 1 degree. Various scenarios used by climate modelers suggest that average surface temperatures could easily rise another 4 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century, based on mid-range projections. That is a level that many experts deem dangerous.\nIf the warmer climate increases the destructive power of hurricanes and typhoons, as two studies indicate it already has, the storm devastation could get worse on coasts that lie along their traditional paths. If the massive ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica melt faster than long estimated \u2014 a trend that some recent studies suggest has already started \u2014 the added water could drive up sea levels by several feet in this century, inundating some low-lying coastal areas. If mountain glaciers around the world continue to shrink rapidly, as seems likely, areas that rely on them to store water and release it slowly may face shortages of drinking water. If high temperatures allow disease-carrying insects and plant pests to invade new areas, as some studies show is beginning to happen, or if higher temperatures increase the frequency of heat waves and heavy rainfall, as the world's science academies deem likely, then the health and environmental consequences could be significant.\nNone of this is settled science or sure to happen. But these and other potential risks show what's at stake in the climate debate, and underscore the need to act promptly to head off the worst dangers.\nThe following are some of the most frequently cited red flags for global warming, and a rough rating of how well the alarms stand up under scientific scrutiny.\nRising Sea Levels: Clear Risk, Uncertain Magnitude\n Sea levels have already been rising steadily in a warming world \u2014 roughly half a foot over the past century \u2014 partly because heat causes water to expand and partly because the water from melting glaciers ultimately finds it way to the sea. There is some evidence that the rate of the rise may be accelerating, but whether this is a trend or a temporary natural fluctuation is not yet clear. Either way, future sea levels are sure to be higher than they are today. \nOne plausible, middle-of-the-road scenario suggests that, by the end of this century, thermal expansion and glacier water may cause the globe's average sea level to have risen roughly half a foot to a foot and a half. That would cause hardship in low-lying areas, but it would probably be manageable for most of the world.\nSome plausible scenarios suggest that sea levels could easily rise by three feet or so by the end of the century. That level could threaten tens of millions of people who live in the low-lying river deltas of places like Bangladesh, Vietnam and Egypt and would flood many populated atolls. In this country, the rising seas could inundate perhaps 6,000 square miles of dry land that is less than three feet above high tide, of which 5,000 square miles is currently undeveloped. A typical sloping beach might be pushed a hundred yards inland. Decisions would have to be made on where to spend money to hold the sea back and where to let it advance. Then there's a worse-case possibility. The big threat would come if the ice sheets in Greenland or Antarctica were to dump a large portion of their contents into the sea, driving sea levels far higher in centuries to come. That is the nightmare that would bury a huge chunk of Florida under water, force the evacuation of low-lying cities in Asia, and submerge stretches of lower Manhattan \u2014 but probably not until some distant era. \nGreenland: A Potential Disaster\nOf all the Arctic lands, Greenland is the one causing scientists the most consternation. The huge island is covered by a massive ice sheet, almost two miles thick in some places. If completely melted it would release enough water to raise sea levels around the world more than 20 feet. But almost no one deems that prospect likely on any time scale not measured in centuries or millennia.\nFor years now scientists have been debating whether Greenland is gaining ice or losing it. Snowfalls at higher elevations in the interior have been adding to the mass of ice while melting has occurred at lower elevations and along the edges. There has been no firm agreement on the net balance.\n So why worry? \nWhat's caused a sudden spike in alarm was a completely unexpected finding last year that the amount of ice flowing into the sea from large coastal glaciers in southern Greenland has almost doubled in the past decade. Outlet glaciers have started moving toward the sea much faster than before. That is either because floating ice tongues that held them back have disintegrated in the warming climate or because water from ice that is melting on top of the glaciers has poured down crevasses and lubricated the surface beneath \u2014 or most likely a combination of both. \nThese unnerving developments still do not mean that a huge part of the ice sheet will slip off of Greenland any time soon. But it does mean that Greenland has likely fallen into a net annual loss of ice and will be contributing more to rising sea levels than was previously anticipated. It is possible that the slide rate will subside in coming years. But some experts think Greenland could reach a tipping point where feedback mechanisms will accelerate the loss of ice indefinitely. \nAntarctica: Another Long-Range Danger\nThe continent at the South Pole is so vast and so frigid it is hard to think of it being endangered by rising temperatures. But worrisome things are happening on the far western fringes of the continent. It was breathtaking back in 2002 when a block of floating ice the size of Rhode Island disintegrated rapidly and separated from the Larsen-B ice shelf. And that was only the largest of many blocks of ice that have broken off the floating ice shelves adjoining the Antarctic Peninsula, a narrow strip of land that juts northward and has the warmest weather on the continent. Such blocks are already floating, so their melting has no effect on sea levels. But the ice shelves act like a stopper, and their disappearance can open the way for land-based ice behind them to flow into the sea, as is already happening in some areas.\nAs with Greenland, there is strenuous debate about whether Antarctica as a whole is gaining or losing ice. The losses have mostly occurred at the edges of  the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which comprises about 10 percent of the continent, while the far larger East Antarctic Ice Sheet has been slowly gaining mass in the interior from increased snowfall. The studies are conflicting: they find either a net gain or net loss continent-wide.\nNew evidence suggests the situation is deteriorating. A recent satellite study, the most comprehensive survey yet, shows a much greater loss of ice than previously estimated in the west and a roughly steady state in the east, suggesting that Antarctica is clearly falling into the loss column. The study covered only three years so no one is sure whether it has detected an abnormal blip or an accelerating downward trend driven by the region's recent warming, and it used a new technological approach that needs more validation.\nIt will take time to determine what the long-range future for Antarctic ice will be. Climate models suggest that the continent could actually gain a little ice in this century, through increased snowfall, thereby reducing sea levels slightly. But that projection could change if the current migration of Antarctic ice to the sea continues or accelerates.\nThe worst-case nightmare has long been that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which is partly grounded on land below sea level, might disintegrate entirely under the combined pressures of higher air temperatures above and warming seas below. If it did, it could release enough ice to raise sea levels by roughly 15 to 18 feet some hundreds of years in the future. \nMelting in the Arctic: The Threat Is Here\nWhen it comes to melting ice, the Arctic is getting the most popular attention. Surface temperatures have risen for the past several decades, the sea ice that covers the Arctic Ocean has been thinning and shrinking, and some of the permafrost on land has been thawing. Some scientists predict that, by the end of the century, the Arctic may be completely ice-free in the summer, though not in the winter. \nOnce again, skeptics argue that there is less than meets the eye. They note that temperatures in the Arctic seem to be within range of those encountered in the not-so-distant past. Some studies have found that temperatures in parts of the Arctic were actually higher in the 1930's than today, though whether that was true of the Arctic as a whole is difficult to say because of a paucity of data. \nWhat has clearly changed is the size and thickness of the floating ice cap. The area covered by sea ice has expanded and contracted over the last century, but in the mid-1970's it started a steep decline toward a record low last year. \n How much of this can be blamed on greenhouse gas emissions? Some experts attribute the ice loss to a cyclical shift in wind patterns. The winds pushed part of the floating ice around the Arctic, thinning it in some areas, piling it up thickly in others, and flushing some out into the North Atlantic. What looks like a disappearing ice cap may really be a partially displaced ice cap, they say. But that is not a universal opinion. Other experts contend that, even as the winds have become less of a factor in recent years, the ice cap is still contracting, suggesting that rising temperatures are now the main driver. \nThe biggest worry is that \"feedback processes\" may take hold and drive the Arctic into deeper trouble. Ice reflects sunlight back into space but open water absorbs most of the sun's energy. As the water warms up, it melts more ice and exposes more sea to absorb more heat in a cascading process that could become self-sustaining. \nThe Arctic is subject to so much natural turbulence that some experts believe it may well go through periods in the next few decades when the region cools again and its ice pack grows. But in the long run, computer simulations show, greenhouse gases will dominate over natural causes and will drive the region toward higher temperatures and less ice.\nThawing Permafrost: An Iffy Prognosis\nHuge stretches of tundra in the Arctic consists of \"permafrost\" that is frozen solid for some or all of the year. But over the past several decades, some of the permafrost has thawed, making once-hard roads less usable, damaging buildings, railroads and airport runways in northern Russia, and causing trees and telephone poles to tilt drunkenly in the suddenly soft terrain. This is causing practical problems in areas reliant on more solid footing.\nWhat it bodes for the future of climate change is still unclear.\nSome scientists fear a looming catastrophe, if the massive amounts of carbon locked up in permafrost are released and add their weight to greenhouse warming, or if permafrost that turns into boggy marshes releases methane, an even more potent greenhouse gas. That is already happening on a small scale, and it could get worse. \nOptimists argue that the softer ground and rising temperatures will allow shrubs and other plants to invade formerly frigid areas, and such vegetation will absorb carbon dioxide from the air, reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases. But even if that happens, some scientists say it could make things worse. As trees and shrubs spread north, they could absorb more sunlight than the lighter tundra did, further warming the local climate.\nOnly a small percentage of the permafrost has degraded so far, but the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment suggested that 10 to 20 per cent of the current permafrost area might degrade over the next hundred years. What impact that would have on the release of greenhouse gases won't be clear until we have more evidence. This is a much more iffy situation than is presented by Greenland and Antarctica, where there is clear reason for concern.\nMountain Glaciers: The Best Evidence\nMountain glaciers are probably the single best indicator of climate change because they are highly responsive to changes in temperature, precipitation and solar radiation. Glaciers are retreating rapidly almost everywhere, including the Himalayas, Alps, Canadian Rockies, Andes, not to mention our own Glacier National Park, the Washington Cascades, and the coast of Alaska.\nThe loss of ice in mid-latitude mountain ranges has been huge. Glaciers monitored in the European Alps lost half their volume between 1850 and 1994. Those in the Caucasus lost half of their volume between 1894 and 1970, and those in the Tian Shan range between Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and China declined 22 percent from 1955 to 1995.\nNaysayers are right when they point out that glaciers have been retreating in an irregular pattern since the end of the Little Ice Age. But the melting seems to have accelerated in recent years and some leading glaciologists think the 20th-century retreat lies outside the range of normal climate variability. The World Glacier Monitoring Service in Zurich concluded that the \"spectacular loss in length, area and volume of mountain glaciers during the 20th century\" was probably not driven by human activity at the start but now may be increasingly propelled by human influences. A panel convened by the National Academies asserted in a recent report that the retreat of glaciers around the world appears in many cases to be \"unprecedented during at least the last 2,000 years.\"\nKilimanjaro: Dubious Evidence\nAfrica's tallest mountain, 19,000-foot-high Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, has become a favorite icon of those concerned about global warming. But this is one case in which the link is debatable. The mountain has been featured in Senate discussions of global warming, and in Al Gore's new movie \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" partly because of eye-catching then-and-now pictures that show a good cap of ice and snow in the past and a balding top today. The discussions include an obligatory reference to Ernest Hemingway's famous short story, \"The Snows of Kilimanjaro,\" providing a literary backdrop for the lament about the rapidly shrinking glaciers at the summit. \nThere is no doubt that the glaciers are disappearing. One expert who has studied the mountain closely calculates that the glaciers could be entirely gone in 10 to 15 years. He puts at least part of the blame on global warming. But other scientists have considerable doubt that rising temperatures have been the main culprit. \nThe ice on Kilimanjaro has been in retreat since at least the 1880's, with the greatest decline occurring at the beginning of that period, when greenhouse gas concentrations were much lower. The dominant reasons for this long-term loss of ice, some researchers say, were a prolonged dry spell in East Africa that deprived the mountain of snowfall, and a reduced cloud cover that allowed more solar radiation to reach the mountaintop where it vaporized the ice by a mechanism unrelated to temperatures. Deforestation on the foothills may also have removed a local source of moisture. Global warming may have added its weight to the scales \u2014 one expert calls it premature to exonerate warming \u2014 but the snows were probably doomed to disappear even without its help. The National Academies panel judged that Kilimanjaro's glaciers \"may be shrinking primarily as a continuing response to precipitation changes earlier in the century.\" \nHurricanes: An Unsettled Question\nThe ravages of Hurricane Katrina last year triggered an outpouring of popular speculation that global warming had already begun to wreak havoc in the form of extreme storms. Hurricanes and typhoons (the name used in the Pacific) draw their energy from warm surface waters, so it is only logical that as the waters warm up, hurricanes should become more powerful. Yet climate scientists on all sides of the global warming debate say it is a mistake to blame any one storm on global warming let alone carbon dioxide emissions. The debate now raging among experts is whether the intensity of hurricanes and of typhoons have increased beyond normal bounds in recent years, and if so, why. Is it global warming or other more traditional drivers, like vertical wind shears and rotational flows in the atmosphere? \nThe issue is difficult to resolve because our understanding of hurricane formation is still rudimentary and historical data on hurricanes is sketchy. Before the age of satellites, which began in about 1980, hurricanes that failed to hit land or pass over a ship often escaped notice, so it is difficult to know how many very powerful storms there really were in past decades. Even today, judging a hurricane's wind speed is as much art as science. American and Japanese typhoon warning centers sometimes differ by two whole categories in how they classify a storm's intensity.\nTwo separate scientific papers last year shocked meteorologists by reporting an increase in the destructive power of the big storms over the past few decades, well before any such effect had been anticipated. One paper found an increase in the frequency of very severe storms, those in Categories 4 and 5. The other found a doubling in destructive potential over the past 30 years. \n Other specialists disagree. They see no sustained increase in hurricane intensity and attribute hurricane behavior mostly to cyclical changes in the atmospheric conditions that hatch hurricanes rather than global warming. This is very much an unsettled issue, with eminent leaders of the field staking out contrary positions.\nBiological Impacts: A Clear and Present Danger\nThe United Nations assessments have already documented a wide range of impacts on living things and the ecosystems they inhabit. Various plants, insects, birds and fish in the northern hemisphere have shifted their ranges toward the north or to higher elevations as those areas become warmer and more welcoming to them. Some plants are flowering earlier, migratory birds are returning earlier, and the growing season is growing longer in higher latitudes.\nThere are spirited debates over how deleterious these changes are but some of the changes are clearly harmful to some forms of life. In the Netherlands, migratory birds and the caterpillars their chicks feed on have responded at different rates to rising temperatures, with the result that chick hatching is now out of sync with the peak caterpillar food supply. In Canada, the mountain pine beetle has moved northward into areas once too cold for it, where it has devastated the pines in a wide area of forest. And on the North Sea coast of Britain, tens of thousands of seabirds failed to raise any young in a massive breeding failure in 2004. The event, whose cause and extent is still being investigated, was likely due to rising water temperatures that, by reducing the abundance of plankton, also reduced the abundance of small fish that the seabirds feed upon. \nThe greater worry is that some species may be pushed toward extinction. Reputable scientists are predicting that extinctions may occur on a massive scale as species fail to adapt or move quickly enough to cope with rising temperatures. Skeptics, on the other hand, see signs that many species will move more rapidly into previously cold areas than they will retreat from warmer areas, with the result that they will actually extend their ranges and thus become more resistant to extinction.\n Still, some birds and other creatures are clearly suffering adverse effects already. The fate of many species may depend on whether the rate of climate change accelerates, making it harder for them to adapt quickly. \nPolar Bears in Peril: An Emerging Risk\nThe species at highest risk live in the Arctic, where the icy world they depend on is melting away around them. Indeed, Time magazine, in a cover story warning us to \"Be Worried. Be Very Worried,\" depicted the Arctic's plight with a photograph of a polar bear on a small ice floe, staring forlornly at broken water it would have to swim through because of gaps in the ice cap. Polar bears are classified as marine mammals because they spend much of the year on the Arctic sea ice, which enables them to reach the seals they prey on and which serves as a platform for mating and building dens. As the sea ice contracts, their options are narrowing.\nPolar bears were once in grave peril from unsustainable hunting. Less than four decades ago their numbers dropped to as few as 5,000, which earned them a spot on our endangered species list. But today, thanks to an international effort to control hunting, the numbers have rebounded to a healthy 20,000 to 25,000 bears, broken up among some 20 distinct population groups. \nThe main evidence that global warming may be having a deleterious impact comes from one population in West Hudson Bay, Canada, near the southernmost edge of the bears' range. Although it is not yet evident that the population of bears there has declined, there is good evidence that the average weight of adult bears has dropped, as has the number of cubs being born and surviving. Researchers attribute these downtrends to an earlier breakup of sea ice because of rising temperatures. The bears are forced to leave the ice and the seals they prey on earlier than in the past, with the result that they have less fat stored on their bodies to help them through the lean months when females give birth.\nElsewhere, except for a region where unsustainable hunting remains a problem, most polar bear populations are believed to be stable or increasing. But the data is spotty, and there was a disturbing report recently in which American and Canadian scientists described three cases of polar bear cannibalism in the Beaufort Sea area north of Alaska and western Canada in 2004. The scientists hypothesized that large male polar bears stalked, killed and partially ate other polar bears because longer ice-free seasons kept them from their normal food. Other polar bears in the same general area seemed in poorer condition than bears elsewhere, suggesting nutritional problems. \nThe real concern is whether further warming and shrinkage of sea ice might drive the bears to extinction. Optimists note that polar bears have existed as a distinct species for some 200,000 to 250,000 years and have already made it through a comparably warm period in the distant past without disappearing entirely. But the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, conducted by nations with lands in the Arctic, concluded that polar bears are unlikely to survive as a species if there is an almost complete loss of summer sea ice, as some climate models predict may happen before the end of this century. Environmentalists have petitioned the Interior Department to list the polar bear as a threatened species, but wildlife experts in Canada's Inuit regions, which depend on revenue from bear hunting, insist that the future of polar bears is secure. The department's inquiry may shed further light on the bears' future prospects. \nStaring Into the Future\nWith all of the most prestigious scientific organizations convinced that global warming is an increasing menace \u2014 and with the vast majority of research articles in leading scientific journals tending to support that consensus \u2014 it would seem wildly irresponsible not to believe it is important to curb emissions. These are the institutions with the most expertise, and they have been studying the issue in unparalleled depth and breadth. Their judgment deserves the utmost respect and attention.\nThat doesn't make it necessary to accept every piece of evidence that's offered. It's possible that in looking so hard for patterns in the data, some experts might be overstating the importance of short-term changes in the environment. \nWe may not know for decades whether grave harm is on the way, but meanwhile we may be adding hundreds of new coal-fired power plants around the world to meet rising energy needs, locking ourselves into a vast carbon-emitting infrastructure that will last for many decades. The world keeps pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere in what amounts to a huge uncontrolled experiment, and a gamble that all will turn out fine. But if even the more moderate projections of global warming turn out to be true, we will be gambling the well being of later generations for short-term advantage. And if the worst-case scenarios turn out to be accurate, we could be dooming much of the planet to a very unpleasant future.",

    "text": "A Spoonful of Foreign Culture Helps Western Medicine Go Down\n2006-06-04T05:00:00.000Z\nWhen officials at Brooklyn's Maimonides Medical Center were preparing a new clinic in Sunset Park in April, everything was ready for the big opening day except the big opening day itself.\n\"One of our staff members told us it was an unlucky date,\" said Pamela S. Brier, the hospital's chief executive. \"We had to change it.\"\nSo the ribbon-cutting, originally scheduled for April 24, was moved to the following day. It was a difference of only 24 hours, but all the difference in the world to the Chinese immigrants the clinic was largely built to serve, who believed the 25th to be a more auspicious date.\nIt was one of the many ways in which the $1 million clinic was carefully designed to cater to Sunset Park's fast-growing Chinese population, one of the largest in the city.\nBecause the color white is associated with death in China, the walls are mostly painted in yellow and pink tones. And because Chinese immigrants have high rates of tuberculosis infection, every patient is tested for it. The chefs in the main hospital's kosher kitchen have learned to prepare rice porridge, a beloved Chinese comfort food. \"Language, culture, food -- it's all tremendously important,\" Ms. Brier said.\nThe new clinic is Maimonides's most ambitious effort to respond to a growing and increasingly diverse population of immigrant patients. It also reflects a broader national shift in health care as urban hospitals move beyond the translation services that started becoming common in the late 1990's and acknowledge that language is not the only barrier they face in treating people from all over the globe.\nSome come from cultures that are broadly skeptical of Western medicine, and prefer the herbs and poultices of traditional healers, \"cures\" that in some cases can retard the effects of prescribed medicines or produce dangerous interactions. Others come from cultures where they are expected to hide sickness from strangers, or where it might be offensive for male doctors to examine female patients.\n\"It's been a slow trend to develop because it's not always clear to a hospital how big a certain community might be, and sometimes it takes a couple of years to manifest,\" said Rick Wade, a senior vice president of the American Hospital Association. But now, he said, programs are appearing everywhere, to strengthen what hospitals call \"cultural competency.\"\nAt Oakwood Hospital in heavily Arab Dearborn, Mich., nurses are trained to point the beds of Muslim patients toward Mecca. In Glendale, Calif., which had a rapid influx of Armenian immigrants during the 1990's, one hospital sponsors a popular health-related call-in show that is broadcast in Armenian on cable-access television.\nBut challenges can be more varied and daunting for hospitals in places like Brooklyn, home to insular communities of Orthodox Jews, Muslims from conservative Arab countries, recent immigrants from rural China and Hispanics from Central and South America, among many others.\n\"In each culture that we're dealing with, there are different ideas, family values and beliefs, whether about medicine or life in general,\" said Virginia Tong, a vice president at Lutheran Medical Center, one of south Brooklyn's largest health care providers. \"Let's say you had an Hispanic godparent who brought a patient in to see a doctor. In this country, we would say, 'That's not a parent;' there might be legal issues. But in their culture, godparents are almost as important as parents.\"\nLutheran's main hospital has a mosque on site; it also runs clinics aimed at Caribbean and Korean immigrants. In 2001, Lutheran opened its own Chinese clinic, on Eighth Avenue in Sunset Park, after a survey showed that most Chinese immigrants in the area were going to Chinatown in Manhattan for medical care.\nMaimonides, long known as \"the Jewish hospital,\" in Ms. Brier's words, has in recent years customized the care at many of its 15 clinics, which are around southwest Brooklyn, based on the cultures and needs of the patients each serves.\nThe doctors at the hospital's Newkirk Avenue clinic, for example, see many Indian immigrants, who have disproportionately high rates of hypertension. Its pediatricians also see many children born in Bangladesh. Because infants there are often not immunized against measles, as most babies are in the United States, that means more effort devoted to vaccination and extra care in reporting cases to public health officials to contain any outbreaks.\nBut the hospital's outreach to Chinese immigrants is its biggest, driven by what its officials believe will be continued population growth in south Brooklyn. \"We go where the patients are,\" Ms. Brier said.\nMaimonides opened its first Sunset Park clinic in a brownstone building in 1996. Within three years, doctors there were seeing 9,000 patients a year, including a growing number of Chinese. The number of patients has doubled since, prompting the latest move from a storefront space to a 10,000-square-foot building on Seventh Avenue and 64th Street.\nThe attending doctors there speak Mandarin or Cantonese, two major Chinese dialects. About 70 percent of the patients are Chinese, according to Dr. Bing Lu, the clinic's medical director, and a significant number are recent arrivals to the United States. Many hold the traditional belief, he said, that drawing blood for tests drains a person's life force, and they are reluctant to allow it.\n\"We teach them that they need it,\" he added, relying on the staff members' language skills and familiarity with Chinese culture to reduce patients' suspicion. \"Generally speaking, Chinese people don't believe in preventative care.\"\nSuch an attitude can be deadly. A few years ago, doctors at the clinic found early signs of liver cancer in a man in his 30's who was infected with hepatitis B. The man left the clinic, Dr. Lu said, and did not return the clinic's phone calls. When he finally came back six months later, he was jaundiced and underweight, with a severely enlarged liver. The cancer had advanced beyond the possibility of life-prolonging surgery.\nIt was \"a fatal mistake,\" said Dr. Lu, who believes the man at first sought out traditional healers instead of returning to the clinic.\nSeveral patients praised the doctors' warmth and staff members' willingness to help them with paperwork. Susan Lin, 31, who emigrated from China's Fujian Province five years ago, said, through an interpreter: \"Sometimes we're afraid to ask questions, to ask how to follow up. Here, they always smile, they are always welcoming. You feel very comfortable asking questions.\"\nRecently, an 80-year-old woman arrived at the clinic just before closing time, asking to see a doctor. She said it was urgent, but when examined she would say only that she had been unable to sleep for about a week.\nUnder careful questioning, Dr. Lu said, she eventually revealed that her husband had died the previous week, and that she had been crying and having anxiety attacks, details that a Chinese woman her age might consider inappropriate to admit.\n\"When you know the culture, you know it's normal, but if you don't, as a practitioner, you can miss a significant problem,\" Dr. Lu said. \"She could easily have been turned away from the clinic that day.\"",

He is a member of one of the black African tribes now being hunted down by the Sudanese-sponsored janjaweed Arab militia, at first in Darfur alone and now in Chad as well.\nAfter the janjaweed attacked his village and shot his father, Ismail raced forward to cover his father\u2019s body with his own. That courage didn\u2019t move the janjaweed, who simply shot Ismail as well. \nThe genocide that started in Darfur in 2003 is now threatening to topple the governments of Chad and the Central African Republic. If these two countries collapse into chaos and civil war for years to come, then neighboring countries like Cameroon and Niger will be threatened as well \u2014 and the death toll triggered by the Darfur genocide will eventually number in the millions.\nNone of this was \u2014 or is \u2014 inevitable. In late 2003 and early 2004, some Republican appointees in the Bush administration (particularly in the Agency for International Development) were among the first to push for a government response to the slaughter in Darfur, but the White House wasn\u2019t interested. \nThen in 2004, Colin Powell boldly used the \u201cgenocide\u201d label to describe Darfur, over initial Pentagon and White House objections, and several of his aides drafted a set of policy options to confront the genocide. Those included pushing the French to use fighter aircraft from their base in Chad to intimidate the janjaweed, pushing Egypt to be more involved, recruiting peacekeeping troops from Pakistan and Bangladesh, and generally using American diplomatic muscle to push harder for a solution.\nNone of those things happened, partly because of reluctance from the White House and Pentagon, and partly because of resistance from France and other countries. So the genocide in Darfur has steadily expanded.\nArabs here in Chad repeatedly complain now that the black Africans steal their cattle, poison their wells, occupy their land, and shoot at them. I don\u2019t see much basis to those charges, for the Arabs have assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades (supplied by the Sudanese), while the black Africans have bows and arrows, but this narrative is widely held among Arabs.\n\u201cWe consider them our enemies and they consider us their enemies,\u201d said Brahim Wadia, the patriarch of a group of Arabs who were grazing their cattle on what had been a black African farm. \u201cSo each side will shoot the other and kill the other.\u201d\nMr. Brahim and most members of his entourage were light-skinned, and they were civil to me (considering it white solidarity?). But that same morning nearby, several black Africans who tried to recover food from their burned and abandoned village were shot dead.\nOne person in Mr. Brahim\u2019s party was a boy of about 13 with black skin who looked unlike the others. He appeared physically unable to speak, and it wasn\u2019t clear if he had been hired as a herdsman or captured in a raid and enslaved.\n The most common question I get from readers about Darfur is: What can I do? The simplest answer is to write or call the White House and members of Congress. (See how your representative does on the issue at www.darfurscores.org). Imagine if Mr. Bush had made Darfur an important issue at the Asian summit meeting last week, if he had returned via Cairo for a meeting with Arab leaders, if he had dispatched Condi Rice to Chad to shore it up.\nBeyond pushing our own government, we can write the embassies of countries like France and Egypt that could play especially crucial roles. The same is true of China, which provides Sudan the guns used to shoot children like Ismail. We in the news business, including Arab and European television networks, could use a few pokes to appreciate that genocide is newsworthy.\n The heroic efforts of aid groups in Darfur and Chad \u2014 13 aid workers have been killed in Darfur since May \u2014 deserve support as well. (I list some groups active in Darfur in my blog, nytimes.com/ontheground.) The aid workers risk their lives daily to try to save people, putting up with janjaweed, scorpions, camel spiders and pit toilets inhabited by bats. They can use our backup. \nIn case you missed it, here are some videos that accompanied my earlier columns about the Darfur crisis.",

    "text": "Today\u2019s Cause Finds Audience in Central Park\n2006-09-19T04:00:00.000Z\nIF you wanted to feel miserable about the state of the world, Central Park was the place to go on Sunday. There, among the usual cadre of joggers, in-line skaters, cyclists and buskers, some serious issues tried chipping their way into the city\u2019s weekend consciousness, a realm normally governed by questions no weightier than whether to order an egg-whites-only omelet at brunch.\nIn the East Meadow, thousands gathered to voice outrage over the carnage in the Darfur region of Sudan and to demand that United Nations troops be sent there to prevent more mass death.\nMost of the protesters were quite young. That had to encourage those among their elders who lament political lethargy in a generation that, to the oldsters anyway, seems more comfortable with gawking than with doing. It remains to be seen, though, if the expressions of anguish over Darfur are part of a sustained humanitarian outcry or a fashionable impulse of the moment.\nIf that sounds unduly cynical, you might ask yourself when was the last time you thought of Bangladesh as anything more than the spark for a really neat concert years ago at Madison Square Garden. When did you last wonder how things are going in the place that used to be called Biafra? If \u201cwhat\u2019s Biafra\u201d just crossed your lips, you answered the question.\nSome who went to the East Meadow rally also spent time on Cherry Hill, overlooking Central Park\u2019s lake. An exhibition made to resemble a refugee camp had been set up there by Doctors Without Borders, the Nobel-Peace-Prize-winning group also known as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.\n(It seems to be O.K. once again to mention things French without being deemed politically improper. Even Congress has returned to selling \u201cFrench fries\u201d in its cafeterias, abandoning the \u201cfreedom fries\u201d label imposed on the eve of the war in Iraq. Apparently, Capitol Hill came to realize that it had taken French leave of its senses.)\nThe purpose of the exhibition, which moves to Prospect Park in Brooklyn tomorrow, was to call attention to the plight of 33 million people around the world said to have been uprooted by war. They include many in Darfur.\n\u201cThere is nobody I have ever seen, even in the poorest country, who will move from his home if he doesn\u2019t have to,\u201d a doctor said as he guided visitors past displays of emergency food, medical care, canvas tents and makeshift latrines.\nPeople were led through the encampment in groups of 20 or so. Some had waited for as long as half an hour to get in.\nIt was a testament to New Yorkers\u2019 acceptance of queuing as a way of life. It makes no difference what is at stake: a movie, a restaurant table, an art exhibition, a play or a mock refugee camp. The capacity for standing in line seems infinite.\nIt was also hard not to notice that, on Sunday afternoon anyway, women outnumbered men at the Doctors Without Borders display by about three to one.\nWas this because so many children are among the world\u2019s refugees, and women are universally accepted as nurturers? Or does it mean that New York men can be counted on to be self-absorbed or preoccupied with less-than-cosmic pastimes like Sunday football games? Your choice.\nSUNDAY in the park with George \u2014 as in Bush, the president\u2019s name being invoked repeatedly, and unfavorably, by Darfur protesters \u2014 reaffirmed that Central Park is a destination for those concerned with big issues: nuclear proliferation, war, hunger. It is not where New Yorkers go to talk about important but relatively parochial topics like housing and subway fares.\nAdrian Benepe, the parks commissioner, said that organizers of the Darfur rally had told him that \u201cNew York is the big stage for your cause and Central Park is the big stage of New York.\u201d Of course, that also explains the agitated debate over strict limits that the city has placed on using the park\u2019s principal expanse, the Great Lawn.\nNot that events like Sunday\u2019s were for everyone.\nA young woman waiting to get into the refugee camp called a friend on her cellphone to say she would head next to the Darfur rally. The friend must have been clueless.\n\u201cDarfur,\u201d the woman repeated. \u201cDarfur? It\u2019s in the Sudan, where there\u2019s a dictatorship and people getting killed?\u201d\nFor some New Yorkers, chipping into that weekend consciousness may take time.",

    "text": "Billy Preston, 59, Soul Musician, Is Dead; Renowned Keyboardist and Collaborator\n2006-06-07T05:00:00.000Z\nCorrection Appended\nBilly Preston, the splashy gospel-rooted keyboardist whose career included No. 1 solo hits and work with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, died yesterday in Scottsdale, Ariz. He was 59.\nHe died after having been in a coma since November, his manager, Joyce Moore, told The Associated Press. He had voluntarily entered a drug rehabilitation clinic in Malibu, Calif., and suffered pericarditis there, leading to respiratory failure that left him in a coma.\nMr. Preston had an extensive career as a sideman, working with musicians from Little Richard to the Red Hot Chili Peppers. His own hits included the Grammy-winning instrumental \"Outa-Space\" in 1972 and the No. 1 pop singles \"Will It Go Round in Circles\" (1973) and \"Nothing From Nothing\" (1974). He also wrote (with Bruce Fisher) the ubiquitous \"You Are So Beautiful.\"\nBut his best-known performance was the afternoon he spent on a London rooftop with the Beatles in what was their last concert, which was filmed for \"Let It Be.\" In a 2001 interview, he recalled, \"They made me feel like a member of the band.\"\nWilliam Everett Preston was born in Houston on Sept. 9, 1946, and grew up in Los Angeles. He was a child prodigy who accompanied the gospel singer Mahalia Jackson when he was 10. In 1958, he played the young W. C. Handy in the film biography \"St. Louis Blues.\" Little Richard hired Mr. Preston for a European tour in 1962, and during that tour Mr. Preston met the fledgling Beatles -- who were Little Richard's opening act -- as well as Sam Cooke, who hired Mr. Preston for his band and signed him to his own label, SAR Records. After Mr. Cooke's death, Mr. Preston began recording instrumental albums with titles like \"The Wildest Organ in Town\" (1965) and \"The Most Exciting Organ Ever\" (1966).\nHe worked in the house band of the pop TV show \"Shindig,\" then joined Ray Charles' band for three years. George Harrison of the Beatles saw him with Charles' band, and brought him to work with the Beatles.\nMr. Preston was signed to the Beatles' label, Apple, and made two albums produced by Harrison: \"That's the Way God Planned It\" and \"Encouraging Words.\" He was invited to join the recording sessions that yielded \"Let It Be\" and \"Abbey Road,\" where he helped hold together the band. \"It was a struggle for them,\" Mr. Preston said in 2001. \"They were kind of despondent. They had lost the joy of doing it all.\"\nThe Beatles' 1969 single of \"Get Back\" is credited to \"The Beatles With Billy Preston,\" the only shared label credit in the Beatles' own career. Mr. Preston appeared at the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh that Mr. Harrison organized, and did studio work on solo projects by Mr. Harrison, John Lennon and Ringo Starr.\nMr. Preston's own career flourished in the early 1970's, when he had his major hits: synthesizer-topped instrumentals (\"Outa-Space\" and \"Space Race\") and jaunty soul songs (\"Will It Go Round in Circles\" and \"Nothing From Nothing\"). He worked in the studio with the Rolling Stones on their 1970's albums, among them \"Sticky Fingers\" and \"Exile on Main Street,\" and toured with them. He was also a studio musician on Sly and the Family Stone's \"There's a Riot Goin' On\" and on Bob Dylan's \"Blood on the Tracks.\"\nMr. Preston was the musical guest on the first \"Saturday Night Live,\" broadcast in 1975. He appeared in the 1978 Beatles-inspired film \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" as Sergeant Pepper In 1979 he had a hit duet with the singer Syreeta Wright, \"With You I'm Born Again.\"\nHe continued working as a studio sideman and making solo albums through the 1980's, and he toured with Ringo Starr's All-Starr Band in 1989. But a longtime drug problem caught up with him in 1992, when he pleaded no contest to charges of assault and cocaine possession and spent nine months at a drug rehabilitation center. He made gospel albums during the 1990's, including \"Minister of Music\" in 1995 and \"Words and Music,\" with Edna Tatum, in 1996. In 1997 he was sentenced to three years in prison for violating probation, and in 1998 he pleaded guilty to insurance fraud.\nAfter Mr. Preston was released from prison, he was welcomed as a musician. He appeared in the movie \"Blues Brothers 2000\" and performed at the 2002 Concert for George, a tribute organized by Eric Clapton a year after Harrison's death. He appears on Mr. Clapton's album \"Me and Mr. Johnson,\" and toured with Mr. Clapton. He was a studio musician on Neil Diamond's \"12 Songs\" and on the current Red Hot Chili Peppers album, \"Stadium Arcadium,\" and he was one of the guests on Ray Charles' final album, \"Genius Loves Company.\" He made a tribute album, \"Billy Preston's Beatles Salute,\" in 2004, and he performed on the season finale of \"American Idol\" in 2005. He played his final recording session in October, for a coming album by Sam Moore of Sam and Dave.\nHe is survived by his sister, Gwen Gooden, and two half sisters, Lettie Preston and Rodena Williams.\n\"When you're doing it you're just trying to do the best you can,\" Mr. Preston said in 2001. \"You don't know if you're doing something important, and whether it will make history has yet to be seen. Just the fact of being able to do it, and striving to do the best you can, was the accomplishment.\"\nCorrection: June 30, 2006, Friday An obituary on June 7 about the keyboard player Billy Preston included an erroneous credit. He did not play on Bob Dylan's album \"Blood on the Tracks.\"\nCorrection: March 27, 2008, Thursday An obituary on June 7, 2006, about the rock keyboardist Billy Preston misstated his date of birth. His Web site recently announced that he was born on Sept. 2, 1946 -- not Sept. 9, as was widely reported.",

Imagine if Mr. Bush had made Darfur an important issue at the Asian summit meeting last week, if he had returned via Cairo for a meeting with Arab leaders, if he had dispatched Condi Rice to Chad to shore it up.\nBeyond pushing our own government, we can write the embassies of countries like France and Egypt that could play especially crucial roles. The same is true of China, which provides Sudan the guns used to shoot children like Ismail. We in the news business, including Arab and European television networks, could use a few pokes to appreciate that genocide is newsworthy.\nThe heroic efforts of aid groups in Darfur and Chad -- 13 aid workers have been killed in Darfur since May -- deserve support as well. (I list some groups active in Darfur in my blog, nytimes.com/ontheground.) The aid workers risk their lives daily to try to save people, putting up with janjaweed, scorpions, camel spiders and pit toilets inhabited by bats. They can use our backup.",

    "text": "Today\u2019s Cause Finds Audience in Central Park\n2006-09-19T05:00:00.000Z\nIF you wanted to feel miserable about the state of the world, Central Park was the place to go on Sunday. There, among the usual cadre of joggers, in-line skaters, cyclists and buskers, some serious issues tried chipping their way into the city's weekend consciousness, a realm normally governed by questions no weightier than whether to order an egg-whites-only omelet at brunch.\nIn the East Meadow, thousands gathered to voice outrage over the carnage in the Darfur region of Sudan and to demand that United Nations troops be sent there to prevent more mass death.\nMost of the protesters were quite young. That had to encourage those among their elders who lament political lethargy in a generation that, to the oldsters anyway, seems more comfortable with gawking than with doing. It remains to be seen, though, if the expressions of anguish over Darfur are part of a sustained humanitarian outcry or a fashionable impulse of the moment.\nIf that sounds unduly cynical, you might ask yourself when was the last time you thought of Bangladesh as anything more than the spark for a really neat concert years ago at Madison Square Garden. When did you last wonder how things are going in the place that used to be called Biafra? If \"what's Biafra\" just crossed your lips, you answered the question.\nSome who went to the East Meadow rally also spent time on Cherry Hill, overlooking Central Park's lake. An exhibition made to resemble a refugee camp had been set up there by Doctors Without Borders, the Nobel-Peace-Prize-winning group also known as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.\n(It seems to be O.K. once again to mention things French without being deemed politically improper. Even Congress has returned to selling \"French fries\" in its cafeterias, abandoning the \"freedom fries\" label imposed on the eve of the war in Iraq. Apparently, Capitol Hill came to realize that it had taken French leave of its senses.)\nThe purpose of the exhibition, which moves to Prospect Park in Brooklyn tomorrow, was to call attention to the plight of 33 million people around the world said to have been uprooted by war. They include many in Darfur.\n\"There is nobody I have ever seen, even in the poorest country, who will move from his home if he doesn't have to,\" a doctor said as he guided visitors past displays of emergency food, medical care, canvas tents and makeshift latrines.\nPeople were led through the encampment in groups of 20 or so. Some had waited for as long as half an hour to get in.\nIt was a testament to New Yorkers' acceptance of queuing as a way of life. It makes no difference what is at stake: a movie, a restaurant table, an art exhibition, a play or a mock refugee camp. The capacity for standing in line seems infinite.\nIt was also hard not to notice that, on Sunday afternoon anyway, women outnumbered men at the Doctors Without Borders display by about three to one.\nWas this because so many children are among the world's refugees, and women are universally accepted as nurturers? Or does it mean that New York men can be counted on to be self-absorbed or preoccupied with less-than-cosmic pastimes like Sunday football games? Your choice.\nSUNDAY in the park with George -- as in Bush, the president's name being invoked repeatedly, and unfavorably, by Darfur protesters -- reaffirmed that Central Park is a destination for those concerned with big issues: nuclear proliferation, war, hunger. It is not where New Yorkers go to talk about important but relatively parochial topics like housing and subway fares.\nAdrian Benepe, the parks commissioner, said that organizers of the Darfur rally had told him that \"New York is the big stage for your cause and Central Park is the big stage of New York.\" Of course, that also explains the agitated debate over strict limits that the city has placed on using the park's principal expanse, the Great Lawn.\nNot that events like Sunday's were for everyone.\nA young woman waiting to get into the refugee camp called a friend on her cellphone to say she would head next to the Darfur rally. The friend must have been clueless.\n\"Darfur,\" the woman repeated. \"Darfur? It's in the Sudan, where there's a dictatorship and people getting killed?\"\nFor some New Yorkers, chipping into that weekend consciousness may take time.\nNYC E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com",

    "text": "Big Gulp\n2006-02-26T05:00:00.000Z\nEthos Water\nEthos Water comes in a tasteful bottle with a bold claim on the front: \"Helping children get clean water.\" This refers to the fact that 5 cents of every $1.80 (or so) bottle purchased is put toward water projects in underdeveloped regions. The target is the consumer with a conscience. \"One of the best questions we get from consumers is, How do I do more?\" says Jonathan Greenblatt, a founder. \"That's exactly what we want to hear.\" Last year, Ethos was bought by Starbucks, which touted the purchase as an important addition to its corporate social-responsibility efforts. To Greenblatt, this speaks volumes about what consumers want from companies these days: \"It's about being part of the global community and making a difference and enabling those consumers who want to, quote-unquote, do more.\"\nIt's true. Many of us do want to, quote-unquote, do more. And there is something striking about the way that Ethos addresses this desire. After all, the American consumer's insatiable thirst for what Tom Wolfe has called \"designer water\" has proved a durable symbol of silly conspicuous consumption. Americans spend billions of dollars on bottled water, and \"if we could divert just a small percentage of that, it would have an amazing impact,\" Greenblatt says. In 2005, Ethos sales resulted in $250,000 worth of investments in sustainable water programs in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India and elsewhere. The goal is to raise $10 million over five years.\nPeter Thum, the other Ethos founder, became familiar with third-world water access problems while working in Africa for McKinsey, the giant consulting firm. He and Greenblatt were inspired by the likes of socially responsible brands like Newman's Own and the Body Shop, but \"with a twist,\" the official Ethos history explains, \"uniquely linking the product to a related humanitarian cause.\" Informal focus groups with friends in their 20's and 30's found that buyers of Ben & Jerry's ice cream and Stonyfield Farms yogurt didn't necessarily connect those brands to particular issues. But they responded well to the Ethos pitch. \"That water-for-water link just seemed to click,\" Greenblatt says.\nThe first retailer to sell Ethos (which comes from natural springs) in August 2003 was Fred Segal in Santa Monica, a store more associated with $200 jeans than with activism; the founders were aiming for trend-setting customers. They later picked up some Whole Foods stores and others; Starbucks bought Ethos for $8 million in 2005, making it available in thousands of locations.\nThe water-for-water link draws a mixed reaction from some observers. The Green Guide, which positions itself as the Consumer Reports of ecologically sound consumption, generally frowns on bottled water of any kind. Mindy Pennybacker, the editor of the Green Guide, says that this is partly because tap water tends to be better regulated and at least as healthful as most bottled varieties and also because the bottles themselves have a \"huge environmental impact.\" (Recycling advocates contend that 90 percent of water bottles end up in landfills.) The Earth Policy Institute recently argued that producing the bottles to meet American demand consumes 1.5 million barrels of oil a year. You might at least wonder whether it wouldn't make more sense to donate $1.80 to one of the aid organizations Ethos backs and ask your barrista for tap water. Isn't this all a bit like an S.U.V. whose profits finance third-world alternative-energy projects?\nNeedless to say, Thum and Greenblatt see things differently. They have no position on recycling laws, since their focus is helping children around the world get clean water. Raising money, Thum says, is only part of that mission; the brand \"allows people to understand the world water crisis and feel as if they are connected to the solution.\" Sure, Starbucks had profits of half a billion dollars last year and could donate $10 million tomorrow, but writing a check, he says, is less effective in the long run than \"trying to build a movement to address this problem.\" To that end, he and Greenblatt are speaking to business-school groups about their mission and have planned Ethos promotions in connection with World Water Day on March 22 to raise awareness of a massive global problem and how buying Ethos can help. Ethos, as Greenblatt puts it, \"makes activism accessible.\"\nTHE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 2-26-06: CONSUMED E-mail: consumed@nytimes.com",

    "text": "Trading Up\n2006-06-26T05:00:00.000Z\nWASHINGTON - AFTER protests, walk-outs, missed deadlines and deadlock, trade negotiators in Geneva have been moving toward a deal on agricultural subsidies and tariffs that could clear the way for a world trade agreement. The deal negotiators are discussing goes much further than the last round of trade talks. But it will not spur significant growth in low-income economies, the ostensible intended beneficiaries of negotiations known, after all, as the Doha Development Round.\nHowever, a study completed this month by the International Food Policy Research Institute argues that, with two modest changes, the deal on the table in Geneva could bring about greater global economic growth and greater benefits for poor countries.\nThe United States and Europe oppose these changes. But instead of defending narrow commercial interests at exorbitant expense, they should embrace this opportunity to advance their larger strategic goals of promoting prosperity and stability among the world's poorest nations.\nAccording to the study, a deal similar to what is now on the table -- modest cuts in real tariffs, limited cuts in domestic support payments, full elimination of export subsidies and 97 percent duty- and quota-free access for exports from the poorest countries -- would create global gains of $54 billion per year. High-income countries, which have about 80 percent of world income, would get almost 60 percent of the $54 billion. Middle-income countries, which have almost 20 percent of world income, would get about 40 percent. Low-income countries, which have only 1.2 percent of world income, would get 1.9 percent of the gain.\nIn other words, years from now when the agreement is in full force, the low-income countries would still account for only a tiny percentage of growing global markets.\nBut the study went on to model two adjustments that would make the deal more meaningful for poor countries.\nThe first was to exempt from duties and quotas all exports from the least developed countries to the richest countries. If such exports were exempted, the benefits from the deal increase to $70 billion -- with nearly half of that gain going to the poorest countries.\nThe United States is justifiably proud that with an average applied tariff rate of 1.4 percent (in 2005), our economy is among the most open. But Washington wants still to exclude various items of clothing, footwear and agricultural products -- the very products that poor countries have to sell -- from any big cuts in duties, even for the poorest countries. The United States fears a surge of textile imports from places like Bangladesh and Cambodia. But isn't that the very point of a development round?\nAmerican politicians will argue that these protections are needed so that American workers are not asked to bear the brunt of bringing the world's poor into global markets. But the cost of protecting jobs in uncompetitive sectors through tariffs is foolishly high, with little of the benefits accruing to workers. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas reported in 2002 that saving a job in the sugar industry cost American consumers $826,000 in higher prices a year, saving a dairy industry job cost $685,000 per year and saving a job in the manufacturing of women's handbags cost $263,000. Wouldn't these workers choose not to hold an insecure job for another year or two if they had the option instead of getting more education and more training, which would enable them to find work in a growth industry, or health care, retirement and even a college education for their children?\nThe second change proposed by the International Food Policy Research Institute lowers the percentage of \"sensitive and special\" agricultural products that can carry high tariffs from 5 percent to 1 percent. This modification increases world income by $7.5 billion beyond the $54 billion. Because it applies to all countries, the benefits of this change are spread more evenly. But such a step would be particularly good for developing countries like Thailand, Vietnam and Zimbabwe for which agriculture is an important source of export revenue. Here Europe and Japan are fighting the change; they originally pushed for exemptions on 8 percent and 15 percent respectively of agricultural products.\nBy not showing more altruistic leadership in the trade talks, the United States and Europe are in serious danger of missing the chance to lead the world closer to a rules-based global system of markets, trade and finance built on the democratic norms and values both continents profess to support. And in particular, the United States is forgoing an opportunity to restore some luster to its public image overseas.\nBut making the trade deal truly benefit the world's poorest is not simply an act of charity or a public relations gesture. The extra increase in market potential could also enable the poorest countries to attract more investment in roads, ports and training, helping their businesses to grow and opening more opportunities for American and European companies. That's why two weeks ago more than 200 leading American companies, business associations and organizations sent a letter urging American trade negotiators not to accept a \"Doha-lite\" agreement.\nConversely, an unwillingness to make the hard decisions required for a successful Doha Round not only takes those economic benefits off the table, but sends a clear message that rich countries are unwilling to allow 90 percent of humanity access to the same opportunities they had to generate their unprecedented wealth.\nOp-Ed Contributor Susan Sechler, a former deputy director of economics at the Department of Agriculture, is the director of trade and development at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.

    "text": "U.S. Court Orders City to Ensure Aid for Battered Immigrants\n2006-08-30T04:00:00.000Z\n A federal judge yesterday ordered the city to stop illegally denying food stamps and other aid to battered immigrant women and children and to overhaul the error-plagued computer programs and training manuals that continue to lead welfare workers to turn them away.\nThe judge determined that high-level city policymakers had long been aware of the systemic problems, but did little or nothing to fix them until a group of battered women filed a lawsuit late last year. As a result, if the city and state continue to fight the lawsuit, the judge said, he will be highly likely to find them liable for \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to violations of the plaintiffs\u2019 federal and state rights.\n\u201cIt is not the policy of the United States, nor of the State of New York, to leave destitute the battered immigrant wives and children of lawful U.S. residents just because their abusive husbands are no longer supporting them or providing them with a basis for obtaining aid,\u201d the judge, Jed S. Rakoff of United States District Court in Manhattan, wrote in his 83-page decision. He certified the lawsuit as a class action and issued a preliminary injunction against the city and state.\nThe judge commended the city for fixing some of the problems since February, when he issued a partial injunction and held nine days of hearings in the case. But he added that problems persisted because of inadequate training, poor computer design and faulty directives.\n \u201cThe simple truth, moreover, is that the ameliorative actions now taken by the city and state defendants would not likely have been taken if this lawsuit had not been brought and had the court not issued its initial injunction,\u201d he wrote. \nThe decision is awkward for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who is preparing to unveil a plan for attacking poverty in the city, a central goal of his second term. The plan is expected to focus on children, young adults and the working poor.\nJane Tobey Momo, senior counsel for the city, said officials were reviewing the opinion to determine the city\u2019s next steps. \u201cWhile we are disappointed in the court\u2019s findings,\u201d she wrote in a statement, \u201cwe are pleased that the court recognized and commended the city for the extensive recent steps taken to ameliorate the difficulties in delivering benefits to noncitizen immigrants. \n \u201cThe difficult and changing federal and state statutes, regulations and policies present continuing challenges to the process,\u201d she added.\nWhen the lawsuit was filed in December by the New York Legal Assistance Group and the Legal Aid Society, the lawyers called it a last resort, saying that officials had failed to fix problems that forced hundreds of women to choose between staying safe and feeding their families, despite government policies aimed at supporting them until they can get on their feet.\nThe suit seeks back benefits that range from a few hundred dollars to one or two thousand dollars per family in the class. \u201cThat represents months of being able to get by,\u201d said Ronald Abramson, a partner at Hughes Hubbard & Reed, which worked on the case for months without charge, but is now likely to be able to collect more than a million dollars in legal fees from the city. \nAbout a dozen plaintiffs, mostly identified only by initials, include a woman from Senegal helping to prosecute the man accused of torturing her and murdering her sister; a Mexican mother of two whose husband chased her with a gun; and a Bangladeshi woman whose husband, since hospitalized for mental illness, kicked her in the abdomen while she was pregnant, cut up her clothes and threatened to kill her when she tried to go to work.\nSeveral fled to domestic violence shelters, only to find themselves unable to buy food or medicine for their children. In an affidavit, one breast-feeding mother wrote of going hungry and of feeling powerless as she and her young children lost weight. \nThe abuse, documented in orders of protection, police reports and letters from domestic violence shelters, was not in question. Nor was eligibility for aid, often affirmed through administrative \u201cfair hearings,\u201d only to be denied again or automatically cut off.\n One of the basic problems lay in the pull-down computer menu that caseworkers used when entering information about a noncitizen applying for aid. The list of eligible immigration categories mistakenly omitted \u201cbattered qualified alien,\u201d the category in which these women and children fit. \nThat problem was fixed recently, after Judge Rakoff\u2019s February order, but other deficiencies remain. The judge called the violations \u201cthe direct results of the flawed design of the city\u2019s computer system, the pervasive errors in the city\u2019s training materials and policy directives, and the widespread worker ignorance resulting from inadequate training of the city\u2019s employees.\u201d \n \u201cThe Court readily concludes that, given the pervasive and systemic nature of the various problems resulting in the unlawful denial of benefits to plaintiffs, plaintiffs have established a very high likelihood that the city will be found liable on all the plaintiffs claims,\u201d he wrote.\nIn 45 pages devoted to legal findings, he determined that the plaintiffs had established \u201can overwhelming likelihood of success on their contention that the city, in its failure to adequately train its employees, was \u2018deliberately indifferent\u2019 to the violation of plaintiffs\u2019 federal rights.\u201d He added that the state was \u201cvicariously liable\u201d because it supervises the city\u2019s provision of public aid and had failed to change its own programming problems and faulty directives.\nJason Brown, a spokesman for Gov. George E. Pataki, said state officials would not comment until they review the decision. \nMr. Abramson said even last winter, when the judge ordered the city to provide aid to the named plaintiffs, the city\u2019s lawyers returned to court saying their efforts had been stymied because the computer system \u201cerrored-out\u201d many of the cases. \nBut eventually all the families involved in the lawsuit received aid, said Caroline Jane Hickey, a lawyer with New York Legal Assistance Group. \u201cWe are thrilled with Judge Rakoff\u2019s decision to protect the rights of a population with almost no voice,\u201d she said. \nShe cited the case of the Mexican mother identified as J.Z. in the lawsuit, who has since been able to move into public housing in the Bronx with her two children. She has passed a high school equivalency test and found a job at her children\u2019s school.\n\u201cShe has managed to completely turn her life around,\u201d Ms. Hickey said. \u201cShe plans to be a nurse.\u201d",

    "text": "A Small Charity Takes Lead in Fighting a Disease\n2006-07-31T05:00:00.000Z\nPATNA, India - The drug that could have cured Munia Devi through a series of cheap injections was identified decades ago but then died in the research pipeline because there was no profit in it.\nSo Mrs. Devi lay limp in a hospital bed here recently, her spleen and liver bulging from under her rib cage as a bilious yellow liquid dripped into her thin arm. The treatment she was receiving can be toxic, and it costs $500. But it was her best hope to cure black fever, a disease known locally as kala azar, which kills an estimated half-million people worldwide each year, almost all of them poor like Mrs. Devi.\nSoon, however, all that may change. A small charity based in San Francisco has conducted the medical trials needed to prove that the drug is safe and effective. Now it is on the verge of getting final approval from the Indian government. A course of treatment with the drug is expected to cost just $10, and experts say it could virtually eliminate the disease.\nIf approval is granted as expected this fall, it will be the first time a charity has succeeded in ushering a drug to market.\nThis novel way of helping people whose needs have not been met by for-profit pharmaceutical companies is gaining traction. Several partnerships are working to develop drugs to fight neglected diseases, underwritten by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Doctors Without Borders and other groups. Another nonprofit agency, the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation, is searching for a means to prevent tuberculosis.\nFor its first project, the San Francisco charity, the Institute for OneWorld Health, focused on reclaiming the all but abandoned drug, paromomycin, which research found promising in the 1960's.\nThat was the easy part. Its hurdles lay elsewhere. The Internal Revenue Service at first denied the charity nonprofit status, concerned that it looked too much like a for-profit enterprise. The World Health Organization, which controlled the drug, was reluctant to hand over the data needed for further development. And OneWorld Health had to set up clinical trials matching United States and European standards in one of the poorest parts of the world.\nNor was it obvious where the money would come from. The idea of a nonprofit drug company struck many as folly when Dr. Victoria Hale, a former Genentech executive and Food and Drug Administration official, founded OneWorld Health in 2001. So Dr. Hale and her husband started the project using their own money, though they have since won support from the Gates foundation, among others.\n\"My colleagues and mentors in the pharmaceuticals industry told me it was a wild idea, that it would never work out, that I was jeopardizing my reputation,\" Dr. Hale said. \"I started this organization knowing our first project had to be a winner or we wouldn't survive.\"\nAn Ambitious Goal\nDr. Hale hopes to stamp out black fever eventually, a goal that many doctors regard as impossible. \"The last disease we truly eradicated was smallpox,\" she said. \"There's no urgency to eradicating diseases anymore. Why not?\"\nBlack fever is the second-largest parasitic killer in the world after malaria. It is spread by sand flies, and Banthu, the squalid village about an hour's drive from here that Mrs. Devi calls home, is an ideal breeding ground for them.\nThe flies multiply in the cow dung that Mrs. Devi uses as fuel for cooking. They relish the sap in the banana groves and bamboo stands, and they thrive in the thatch used to make the tiny houses. Flies that have bitten infected humans transmit the disease when they bite another person. Smaller than mosquitoes, they can pass through most netting.\nRoughly 90 percent of black fever cases worldwide are found here in Bihar State in India and in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sudan and northeastern Brazil.\nMrs. Devi's daughter was the first in the family to contract the disease, and she died from it. Then Mrs. Devi's youngest son, Rajesh, got it, and she brought him to the Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Science here, where he was treated and recovered. Now she, too, is receiving treatment.\nIt is at the Rajendra Institute, a government research facility, that OneWorld Health set up one of the trials needed to make paromomycin widely available.\nMany Early Battles\nDr. Hale first set her sights on the drug after she attended a conference in Belgium in 1999, where Dr. Shyam Sundar, an expert on black fever, was railing against the world's failure to fight the disease.\n\"The tragedy, maybe even the crime, is that we have known that this drug is an effective treatment for kala azar since the 1960's,\" said Dr. Sundar, whose free clinic in Muzaffarpur was also a site for a trial by OneWorld Health. \"We could do something, but we were choosing not to.\"\nAfter visiting Dr. Sundar's clinic in 2000, Dr. Hale, who was doing consulting work at the time, hired a law firm to help her get the tax exemption necessary to create a nonprofit drug company. The I.R.S. turned her down three times over 10 months, suspicious that her plan was a scheme by the drug industry to shelter profits. The tax agency challenged her to find an example of an existing charity that mirrored a for-profit business.\n\"It took me five days, and then at dinner, it hit me: N.P.R. and public television,\" she said. \"They look an awful lot like for-profit radio and television, but they serve a different audience with programs that their for-profit counterparts don't provide because they can't profit from them.\"\nTwo weeks later, OneWorld Health received I.R.S. approval and set out to tackle black fever.\nThe immediate challenge was financing. For a time, OneWorld Health survived on the largesse of Dr. Hale and her husband, Dr. Ahvie Herskowitz. They put up $100,000, signed a $315,000 promissory note, used the ground floor of their house as offices, and worked without pay for two years.\nThe Gates foundation, which at the time was primarily underwriting vaccines and other preventive strategies, eventually offered a grant of $4.2 million that grew to $47.2 million for the development of paromomycin. Dr. Hale also got help from others, including the Skoll Foundation, which has provided financing to underwrite salaries for new senior executives.\nAn Abandoned Drug\nAn initial, formal test of paromomycin, an antibiotic sold in some countries as an oral treatment for diarrhea and as a topical treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis, which causes lesions, was done in the late 1980's in Africa, two decades after it was identified as a simple, cheap, effective cure for black fever.\nThrough a series of company mergers it was consigned to the corporate shelf and forgotten, ending up with the World Health Organization, which lacked the money to develop it beyond the Phase II clinical trials.\nBut negotiations with the World Health Organization to hand over the data that would allow OneWorld Health to organize the Phase III clinical trials necessary for regulatory approval dragged on for almost two years. At the time, the W.H.O was developing another drug for black fever with Zentaris, a large pharmaceutical company, and the Indian government. That drug, miltefosine, has the advantage of being an oral treatment, while paromomycin is administered by injection.\nBut miltefosine, an anticancer drug, also has drawbacks. In trials, it caused gastrointestinal problems in one-third of the patients. And patients must be strictly supervised to ensure that they take the full 21-day course of treatment and that women of child-bearing age are using birth control. By contrast, paromomycin has shown almost no side effects in trials.\nWith a price of $100 to $200 a treatment, miltefosine is out of reach for most patients and government purchasing programs.\nDr. T. K. Jha, a specialist in black fever who oversaw one of the OneWorld Health trials, said the W.H.O. wanted to make sure miltefosine made it onto the market before handing over its data on paromomycin. \"Commerce got in the way,\" Dr. Jha said.\nBut Dr. Robert G. Ridley, director of the W.H.O.'s special program for research and training in tropical diseases, disputed that. Dr. Ridley wrote in an e-mail message that the \"time lag\" had to do with getting financing from the Gates foundation and the process of negotiating an agreement with OneWorld Health.\nThe subject of the commercial aspects of drugs is a difficult one for OneWorld Health, which is careful to avoid criticism of its for-profit cousins, as well as competition with them.\n\"We look a lot like each other,\" Dr. Herskowitz said. \"But we fill a gap pharma companies cannot because they have to make a profit.\"\nBut given the choice of paying more than $100 for Zentaris's miltefosine or $10 for paromomycin, governments and most patients will no doubt choose the cheaper drug.\nOneWorld Health does not intend to gain income from the drug. It has given a license to Gland Pharma, an Indian drug company that has agreed to manufacture the drug and sell it at cost when it is approved. But Dr. Hale can foresee a time when, say, a drug OneWorld Health hopes to develop to treat childhood diarrhea could be sold to travelers by a for-profit drug maker in exchange for royalties that would help sustain her organization's charitable work.\nStill More Difficulties\nApproval of paromomycin will not end OneWorld Health's challenges. Distribution looms as the next hurdle.\nIn Patepur, a somewhat more prosperous village than Mrs. Devi's, Dr. Syed Misbah Hassan, a clinical research coordinator for OneWorld Health, diagnosed kala azar in one boy after another.\nDilip Manjhi, who is about 15, lay listless on a string bed as Dr. Hassan examined his abdomen for the telltale signs of the disease, a swollen spleen and liver. Dilip's spleen extended eight centimeters below his rib cage and was rock hard. His liver protruded three centimeters below his ribs.\nGetting paromomycin to remote villages like Patepur at the end of pothole-pocked roads will be difficult. Dr. Hale is trying to enlist a British nonprofit group, Riders for Health, to help. The group uses motorcycles to connect poor people to medical services. In Zimbabwe, for instance, it has taken pregnant women in need of Caesarean sections to hospitals.\n\"My thinking,\" Dr. Hale said, \"is that we could equip a motorcycle with a cooler to transport the drug and equip the driver to give the injections and maintain records.\"\nBut first, the Bihar State government and India's central government must create a system that encompasses diagnosing the disease, buying and administering the drug, keeping records and spraying to reduce the sand fly population.\nSome experts wonder whether the government has the will to create such a system, when hundreds of thousands of Indian children die each year of measles, which can be prevented with a 15-cent vaccine. But Dr. C. P. Thakur, a former Indian health minister who oversaw a OneWorld Health trial of paromomycin, noted that black fever was one of five insect-borne diseases the Indian government had pledged to eliminate.\nIndia has also signed an agreement with the governments of Nepal and Bangladesh to eradicate the disease, and the Bihar State government has shown a willingness to work with OneWorld Health.\n\"The government will be the biggest challenge,\" Dr. Thakur said. \"But I believe the opportunities to end this disease have never been better, and also that the government's will has never been stronger.\"",

    "text": "Obituary: Billy Preston, 59, reknowned keyboardist - Arts & Leisure - International Herald Tribune\n2006-06-07T05:00:00.000Z\nNEW YORK \u2014 Billy Preston, the splashy gospel-rooted keyboardist whose career included No. 1 solo hits and work with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, died yesterday in Scottsdale, Ariz. He was 59.\nHe died after having been in a coma since November, his manager, Joyce Moore, told The Associated Press. He had voluntarily entered a drug rehabilitation clinic in Malibu, California, and suffered pericarditis there, leading to respiratory failure that left him in a coma.\nPreston had an extensive career as a sideman, working with musicians from Little Richard to the Red Hot Chili Peppers. His own hits included the Grammy-winning instrumental \"Outa-Space\" in 1972 and the No. 1 pop singles \"Will It Go Round in Circles\" (1973) and \"Nothing From Nothing\" (1974). He also wrote (with Bruce Fisher) the ubiquitous \"You Are So Beautiful.\"\nBut his best-known performance was the afternoon he spent on a London rooftop with the Beatles in what was their last concert, which was filmed for \"Let It Be.\" In a 2001 interview, he recalled, \"They made me feel like a member of the band.\"\nWilliam Everett Preston was born in Houston on Sept. 9, 1946, and grew up in Los Angeles. He was a child prodigy who accompanied the gospel singer Mahalia Jackson when he was 10. In 1958, he played the young W. C. Handy in the film biography \"St. Louis Blues.\" Little Richard hired Preston for a European tour in 1962, and during that tour Preston met the fledgling Beatles - who were Little Richard's opening act - as well as Sam Cooke, who hired Preston for his band and signed him to his own label, SAR Records. After Cooke's death, Preston began recording instrumental albums with titles like \"The Wildest Organ in Town\" (1965) and \"The Most Exciting Organ Ever\" (1966).\nHe worked in the house band of the pop TV show \"Shindig,\" then joined Ray Charles' band for three years. George Harrison of the Beatles saw him with Charles' band, and brought him to work with the Beatles.\nPreston was signed to the Beatles' label, Apple, and made two albums produced by Harrison: \"That's the Way God Planned It\" and \"Encouraging Words.\" He was invited to join the recording sessions that yielded \"Let It Be\" and \"Abbey Road,\" where he helped hold together the band. \"It was a struggle for them,\" Preston said in 2001. \"They were kind of despondent. They had lost the joy of doing it all.\"\nThe Beatles' 1969 single of \"Get Back\" is credited to \"The Beatles With Billy Preston,\" the only shared label credit in the Beatles' own career. Preston appeared at the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh that Harrison organized, and did studio work on solo projects by Harrison, John Lennon and Ringo Starr.\nPreston's own career flourished in the early 1970's, when he had his major hits: synthesizer-topped instrumentals (\"Outa-Space\" and \"Space Race\") and jaunty soul songs (\"Will It Go Round in Circles\" and \"Nothing From Nothing\"). He worked in the studio with the Rolling Stones on their 1970's albums, among them \"Sticky Fingers\" and \"Exile on Main Street,\" and toured with them. He was also a studio musician on Sly and the Family Stone's \"There's a Riot Goin' On\" and on Bob Dylan's \"Blood on the Tracks.\"\nPreston was the musical guest on the first \"Saturday Night Live,\" broadcast in 1975. He appeared in the 1978 Beatles-inspired film \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" as Sergeant Pepper In 1979 he had a hit duet with the singer Syreeta Wright, \"With You I'm Born Again.\"\nHe continued working as a studio sideman and making solo albums through the 1980's, and he toured with Ringo Starr's All-Starr Band in 1989. But a longtime drug problem caught up with him in 1992, when he pleaded no contest to charges of assault and cocaine possession and spent nine months at a drug rehabilitation center. He made gospel albums during the 1990's, including \"Minister of Music\" in 1995 and \"Words and Music,\" with Edna Tatum, in 1996. In 1997 he was sentenced to three years in prison for violating probation, and in 1998 he pleaded guilty to insurance fraud.\nAfter Preston was released from prison, he was welcomed as a musician. He appeared in the movie \"Blues Brothers 2000\" and performed at the 2002 Concert for George, a tribute organized by Eric Clapton a year after Harrison's death. He appears on Clapton's album \"Me and Mr. Johnson,\" and toured with Clapton. He was a studio musician on Neil Diamond's \"12 Songs\" and on the current Red Hot Chili Peppers album, \"Stadium Arcadium,\" and he was one of the guests on Ray Charles' final album, \"Genius Loves Company.\" He made a tribute album, \"Billy Preston's Beatles Salute,\" in 2004, and he performed on the season finale of \"American Idol\" in 2005. He played his final recording session in October, for a coming album by Sam Moore of Sam and Dave.\nHe is survived by his sister, Gwen Gooden, and two half sisters, Lettie Preston and Rodena Williams.\n\"When you're doing it you're just trying to do the best you can,\" Preston said in 2001. \"You don't know if you're doing something important, and whether it will make history has yet to be seen. Just the fact of being able to do it, and striving to do the best you can, was the accomplishment.\"",

    "text": "'My War at Home': A Muslim Woman's Critique of Custom\n2006-03-25T05:00:00.000Z\nCorrection Appended\nMasuda Sultan was 16 when her Afghan parents arranged for her to marry a doctor almost twice her age. She saw him just once before they were ritually joined, when she was 17, in an Islamic nikkah ceremony that was held in a hotel in Flushing, Queens.\nBy her account in her new memoir, \"My War at Home\" (Washington Square Press), the marriage was a blunder from the first. Although Ms. Sultan had grown up in New York, before the wedding night her mother asked her to follow an old custom: provide the new in-laws with a blood-stained cloth as evidence of her virginity. Once married, she writes, her husband rarely spoke to her, insisted she remain subservient and discouraged schooling beyond college. After three years, feeling despondent to the point of swallowing a bottle of his Valium, she walked away and returned to her parents' Queens home.\nAnd yet, Ms. Sultan, in an interview, said she wrote the book to enlighten outsiders about the virtues of an arranged marriage, like the confidence newlyweds have in a decision by their elders and the domestic bolstering a wife receives from her husband's family.\n\"It's upsetting that people see your culture as backward, who say to me 'You poor victim,' \" she said. \"I think Westerners have a simplistic idea about arranged marriage. Mine didn't work out, but that was not the case for everyone, and it's not necessarily backward to do that.\"\nThat contradiction captures how much Ms. Sultan, like many immigrants, oscillates between two worlds, in her case that of a traditional Afghan daughter and an urbane graduate of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government who has ventured to Afghanistan some 10 times to fight for the rights of women. She has great affection for Afghans, but also misgivings about some traditions. That conflict is her memoir's recurring leitmotif.\nIn telling her story, she has joined the growing ranks of Muslim women who are offering an insider's view of Muslim life at a post-9/11 moment when anxious Americans are curious, as Ms. Sultan says, about \"what drives Muslims, how do they operate behind closed doors.\"\nIn the memoir \"Reading Lolita in Tehran,\" Azar Nafisi describes a women's book club that debates the painful conflicts of living under Islamic law. In the novel \"Brick Lane,\" Monica Ali writes affectingly about a Bangladeshi in London in an arranged marriage whose sister elopes in a \"love marriage.\" And a former Wall Street Journal reporter, Asra Nomani, published \"Standing Alone in Mecca,\" about her pilgrimage to Islam's most holy site last year.\nMore are on their way: Shirin Ebadi, the Nobel Prize-winning Iranian human rights champion, will have a memoir out in May. And Ms. Ali's editor, Wendy Walker, is publishing a memoir in the fall by Mukhtar Mai, the Pakistani woman who was gang-raped by order of a tribal court to avenge her brother's supposed misconduct.\nDavid Ebershoff, an editor at large at Random House who edited Ms. Ebadi's book, said that these books have struck a chord with American readers because \"the personal is a prism into the larger geopolitical story.\" Americans, he said, also respond to the conflicts of women having to juggle their working lives with more traditional roles of wife and mother -- however perilous their experiences might be. In her memoir, Ms. Ebadi writes of the night that she was summoned to jail. On the way out the door she tells her daughters to order a pizza for dinner.\nMs. Sultan feels the Islamic faith has been distorted by some believers, often, as with suicide bombings, for political ends. She recalls studying the Koran at an after-school madrassa and \"having it shoved down your throat -- the students recite and don't know what it means.\"\n\"But the Prophet Muhammad encouraged questions, encouraged looking at other religions and coming to Islam because you think it is the best religion,\" she said.\nThat is why, in trying to expand rights of Afghan women, she works to unearth what she sees as neglected concepts in Islamic texts -- that a woman has a duty to be educated, that she can be paid for housework and that she can negotiate marriage contracts spelling out a husband's obligations.\nMs. Sultan, 27, who has long brown hair and fair skin that, she says, allows her to navigate easily in both Afghan and Western worlds, hails from the same Pashtun tribe, the Popalzai, as does Hamid Karzai, Afghanistan's president. She has at times worn a head scarf or a burka, but is more comfortable in jeans.\nHer family escaped Soviet-occupied Afghanistan in 1983 when she was 5 by hiring a car to spirit them across the treacherous Khojak Pass into Quetta, Pakistan. She grew up in Flatbush and Flushing, which has the city's largest Afghan enclave, and was a star student, though one not immune to newcomer foibles. Through high school, she writes drolly, she confused the words \"prostitute\" and \"Protestant\" and sometimes walked by a church with the nervous curiosity of someone passing a brothel.\nHer parents tried to keep her away from what they saw as the corruptions of American life. She didn't go to the movies until she married. While she passed the admissions test for Stuyvesant High School, her parents -- her father was a partner in a fried chicken restaurant, her mother a housewife -- wanted her closer to home, and she enrolled at Flushing High.\nTheir outlook explains why her parents wanted her to marry young. But, she notes, she was not forced to marry, as some Muslims are.\n\"Their argument was that this guy is really a good match and someone like him may not come again,\" she recalled.\nAfter she left her husband for the first time, the couple's families got them to reconcile, but Ms. Sultan soon found herself \"in real despair.\" Now, she said, \"I can't imagine hitting that low a point.\" She continued: \"I have more of a network now. Then I was very isolated.\" Yet, Ms. Sultan was firm in declaring that her failed marriage did not indispose her toward traditional Muslim men, whom she has often found to be loving.\n\"My father is a very affectionate man who oddly is always helping out around the house,\" she said. \"If my mother could change one thing, it would be to have him doing less in the kitchen.\"\nIn the book, she describes a return to Afghanistan in July 2001 and how enchanted she was with the clannish warmth and cooking smells she remembered from childhood.\n\"I knew that Afghanistan was the part of me I hadn't quite figured out yet,\" she writes with a congenial American vernacular. \"I was like a floating piece of a puzzle, and if I connected to the larger pieces, I might have a better sense of where I belonged.\"\nLater trips to Afghanistan sharpened her understanding of why Afghans are angry at Americans despite their liberation from Taliban rule. Her most searing example: losing 19 kinfolk in what she considers an indiscriminate American bombing of a village outside Kandahar.\n\"My cousin said, 'Is this not terrorism?' \" she said.\nWithin the United States, Afghans have been subversively transformed. Boys and girls court furtively or in Internet chat rooms. When suitors hit it off, they may ask parents to arrange the wedding, pretending they barely know each other. Still, Ms. Sultan said she would marry only a Muslim and might even allow her parents to introduce her to a prospective mate, though only on the condition that she get to know him.\n\"I have to believe there are people out there who can appreciate traditional values around family and community, but who can also appreciate me in my assertive, outspoken manner,\" she said.\nCorrection: March 29, 2006, Wednesday An article in The Arts on Saturday about Masuda Sultan, an Afghan-American writer who has published a memoir, referred incorrectly to her book editor, Wendy Walker. Ms. Walker's authors include Mukhtar Mai, who also offers an insider's view of Muslim life, but not Monica Ali, who writes about a Bangladeshi in London in an arranged marriage; Ms. Ali's editor is Nan Graham.",

    "text": "Questions for Peter Singer\n2006-12-24T13:12:00.000Z\nPeter Singer is the Ira W. DeCamp professor of bioethics at the Center for Human Values at Princeton University. He is the author of many books, including most recently \u201cThe Way We Eat: Why Our Food Choices Matter.\u201d Mr. Singer recently answered readers' questions about the ethics of billionaire spending and philanthropy.\n1. I am a middle school teacher and therefore don't make enough money to give even 10 percent of my income to charity. I justify my lack of donations in this way \u2014 I have given up earning potential to help society. Is this a moral justification? Or should I change careers say, and go into educational sales where I can triple my income and then contribute more money toward eliminating global poverty? \u2014 Annette, Petaluma, Calif.\nYou don't say much about who you are teaching, or what subject you teach, but you do seem to see a need to justify what you are doing. Perhaps you're teaching underprivileged children, opening their minds to possibilities that might otherwise never have occurred to them. Or maybe you're teaching the children of affluent families and opening their eyes to the big moral issues they will face in life \u2014 like global poverty, and climate change. If you're doing something like this, then stick with it. Giving money isn't the only way to make a difference. \n2. In an October article from The New Yorker on micro-enterprise, Muhammad Yunus and burgeoning social entreprenuers, the author looks at the difference between those who do good because they feel a sense of moral duty versus those who do good to make a profit. What are your thoughts on micro-enterprise as an approach to reducing poverty versus providing international aid? \u2014 Emily Webb, Lexington, Ky.\nI'm a pragmatist: whatever works.\n3. I've heard that you maintain a modest lifestyle, but no doubt it's luxurious compared to the circumstances of the world's poverty-stricken people. Without any criticism implied, I'm curious about how you decide that you've given enough, knowing that there are still people suffering in the world. How do you, personally, justify the purchase of a book or a meal or anything beyond the absolute necessities, when that money could have been saving lives? \u2014 Amy, Minneapolis, Minn.\nUltimately, I don't think my indulgences can be justified. I know that I'm very far from being a saint. I should spend less on myself and give away more of what I earn. Of course, I give much more than most. But I know that that isn't the right standard. As for deciding how much is enough, I just do a little better each year.\n4. Your thoughtful assessment of philanthropy and the effort to eliminate world poverty resonated with my own values. In your article, it seems that an underlying assumption is that money is able to remedy many problems associated with world poverty. I do not wish to dispute that fact, but it leads to an unavoidable question: Are the stewards of such large sums of money trustworthy?\nUndoubtedly, the Millenium Development Goals have great potential, but are the wealthy likely to donate large sums money to an organization that has in the past been accused of mis- and mal-administration of multi-billion dollar programs? Would not the next step forward, then, be at minimum to increase the financial transparency of such organizations, or at most, the establishment of a completely independent fund, governed in part by the largest donors? \u2014 Dean Shumway, Chicago, Ill.\nIf you are referring to the United Nations, then \u2014 without either agreeing or disagreeing with your characterization of that organization, I need to point out that I wasn't suggesting that people should donate to that organization. Though the Millennium Development Goals were set by world leaders meeting under the auspices of the UN, the goals can be furthered by donating directly to non-government organizations like Oxfam America (www.oxfamamerica.com) or Millennium Promise (www.millenniumpromise.org).\n5. When thinking about an individual and specific life, it's impossible for me to disagree with the idea of saving each and every child that we can possibly save \u2014 but when considered abstractly I wonder if saving lives is actually helpful to humanity as a whole. Aren't we pushing the world even further out of balance ecologically by increasing population? I know it sounds terrible, but in the long term, wouldn't we be bettter off if more were dying, rather than fewer? In the same vein, isn't there a point at which it becomes detrimental to extend life expectancy in developed countries by advancing medecine? \u2014 Miguel McKelvey, New York, NY\nIt not only sounds terrible, it is terrible. Thirty years ago, the ecologist Garrett Hardin proposed, for reasons very like those you have expressed, that the world should cut off aid to Bangladesh. Instead, in part because aid of many kinds, as well as the highly successful micro-credit schemes started by Muhammad Yunis, continued, Bangladesh is no longer among the world's most desperately poor nations. Moreover, its population growth has slowed. We don't need to wish for mass starvation to reduce population growth. Far, far better is to help other nations get to the point where improvements in health and education \u2014 especially the education of girls \u2014 begin to slow fertility. \n6. Thank you for your provocative analysis and willingness to take questions.\nA moderately affluent New Yorker already contributes approximately 40 percent of her pre-tax income to various government entities in support of public goods that sustain the social capital from which she derives advantage. How ought she reconcile the credible moral imperative to use her income to save lives in the developing world with the observation that a share of her income far greater than your proposed tithe is redirected by the government to domestic purposes that, while critical e.g., education, do not directly satisfy this imperative?\nConsider also that she likely also spends approximately 25 percent of her pre-tax income just on housing, and perhaps approximately 10 percent on basic food and medical expenses for herself and family. At the risk of overloading the question: should she argue for lower taxes for herself on the grounds that her income would be better spent abroad, assuming all lives are of equal value? In the absence of such a trade-off, your proposal seems rapidly to approach the conclusion that an individual should be satisfied with keeping approximately 10 of her income for discretionary spending. \u2014 Tim Kleiman, New York, NY\nWithout taxes, we would have no government, and would not be able to earn our present incomes. Plus, our taxes aid the poor in this country, and that is worth doing. So let's not argue for lower taxes. In view of how privileged moderately affluent New Yorkers are, compared to the poorest 20 percent of the world's people, I don't think it is unreasonable to suggest that they should be satisfied with keeping 10 percent of their income for discretionary purposes. But don't forget that their donations will be tax deductible, so they might end up with a little more.\n7a. Ought we to forget about the poverty that exist in the United States. Certainly, a great number of people are well off in America. But, there still exist a growing number of impoverished people in the United States. How might we integrate your suggestions with a solutions combating poverty in the US? \u2014Keith Lucas, Newark, N.J.\nAnd\n7b. Why is your call to action situated exclusively around poverty outside the U.S. when there is a serious poverty problem right here at home that has neither gotten the philanthropic interest of Gates and Buffett nor much coverage from the national news media? \u2014Ira Silver, Framingham, Mass.\nPoverty in the United States is a problem and we should be seeking to combat it. But there are two reasons why dealing with domestic poverty should not take priority over helping the poor in other country. First, poverty in the U.S. is mostly relative rather than absolute. The U.S. poor have access to social support that can take care of their most basic needs. The 1.2 billion people living on the purchasing power equivalent of less than $1 a day have no food stamps or medicaid schemes to fall back on. Second, a dollar goes much further in Malawi than it does in Mississippi. The costs of helping the U.S. to escape poverty are far higher than those of doing the same for the poor in developing countries.\n8. In your article you state that \"private donors can more easily avoid dealing with corrupt or wasteful governments. They can go directly into the field, working with local villages and grass-roots organizations.\" How big a donor must I be to qualify under this? I would like to educate/help care for children in a poor country, not just by contributing to a charitable organization.( I have about $200,000 to do it.) I would very much appreciate your answer! \u2014Susan Krcmar, New Jersey\nYour willingness to donate such a sum, and your do-it-yourself attitude is highly commendable, but you may find that trying to organize something yourself will chew up a larger portion of the funds you have available than would occur if you gave it to an organize that already has expertise in the developing world, and contact with grass roots organizations. You'll have to travel to developing countries to find the right place for your project, and the right local people to run it. You may have language problems, and not know how to deal with a very different culture. If you are inexperienced in this kind of work, you'll repeat the mistakes that everyone makes at first. \nMaybe a better solution would be to talk to an organization like Oxfam America and see if they already have projects of the kind you are interested in supporting \u2014 for instance, projects to educate or care for children in developing countries. With your generous donation, they will be able to fund more of them. And I'm sure they would be happy for you to go over to the country in which your funds were being used, and see what your money is doing. \n9. I worked in West Africa in the late 1980's and witnessed the inefficiency of the aid organizations. What assurances are provided today to ensure that donations find their way to the people in need i.e. percent delivered vs. percent devoured by administrative waste, inefficiency or worse, corruption? \u2014James Fiebelkorn, Houston, Tex.\nThe better organizations have learnt from the mistakes of the past \u2014 which doesn't mean that there are no mistakes now, but that waste and corruption are less common than they once were. Before you give, talk to the organization you are thinking of donating too, and see what you can find out about their work. If you are thinking of giving a large sum, you might ask about going to see some of their projects for yourself. \n10. Is it ethical for guys like Gates and Buffett to amass this much wealth in the first place? \u2014Sundeep, Peachtree City, Ga.\nThat's the way the system works. It isn't ideal, but we haven't discovered a better method of producing and distributing the goods that people need and want. So I'd say, yes, it is ethical for Gates and Buffett to become extremely rich, as long as they understand that the accumulation of such great wealth carries with it the responsibility to use it, or most of it, for good purposes.",

    "text": "India rising\n2006-02-27T05:00:00.000Z\n\nNEW DELHI \u2014 The glittering skyscrapers of Gurgaon, a satellite city that is home to much of India's outsourcing industry, rise incongruously from the flat dry plains outside Delhi.\nGenpact, the first and one of the largest back-office call centers in India, employs 13,000 mostly young people, processing credit applications and conducting market research for American corporations such as Pfizer and JC Penney. The company is recruiting new employees at a rate of 1,100 a month.\nThey work all night because of time zone differences; they are trained to \"neutralize\" their Indian accents, and some are even given such western- sounding names as Tom or Susan.\n\"The person who comes to work for us has never had a credit card, has never been to the U.S., and has never seen a JC Penney store,\" says Vivek Gour, Genpact's chief financial officer. \"We teach them a lot about the culture to whom they are talking.\"\nA group of journalists traveling to South Asia recently with the East-West Center, a cultural exchange program, found the call center associates enthusiastic about their working conditions. Most came from small towns and loved the adventure.\nBut all around Genpact's air-conditioned cubicles and conference rooms, it is still India. Water buffalo roam the streets, families live in tin shacks and cook on open fires, dusty children with no shoes beg for rupees, there is garbage everywhere, especially plastic bottles and bags, and the traffic is infernal.\nIndia's economy is growing at a vigorous 8 percent. It graduates 400,000 engineers every year, and half of its population is younger than 25, which officials forever promote as a national asset.\nBut it will need to sustain that level of growth and more if it is ever to solve its immense social problems, much less face down competition from China, the other billion-person powerhouse in Asia.\nIndia's advantages are many: an English-speaking population; an open, democratic society, and massive amounts of cheap labor. But the vastness of its numbers also creates vast problems: 400 million illiterates, at least 260 million people living on less than one dollar a day. Plus, a caste system that still prevents social mobility, a tradition of petty corruption, feather-bedding and whirling-fan bureaucracy, an overwhelmed infrastructureand intense pressures on water and energy resources all hobble India's progress.\nThe Congress Party, which took power in 2004 partly because of disaffection by the millions left out of India's boom, has passed an ambitious rural employment-guarantee program that promises to give government jobs to one able-bodied person per family, mostly on road, water, and sanitation projects.\nThe plan is being eyed warily by business, which fears it smacks too much of the socialism India left behind in 1991. \"The roads built by the government break down after the first monsoon,\" said Mohandas Pai, chief financial officer of Infosys Technologies in Bangalore, more than 1,200 miles south of Delhi.\nThe 80-acre Infosys headquarters is the national showcase of India's possibilities. It is a green oasis in a car-choked, drought-stricken city. It employs 16,000 people (average age 27)who ride communal bicycles or golf carts to get around. With its swimming pool, gym club, food courts and bookstore, it looks more like a college campus than a $2.1 billion corporation.\nInfosys founder and chairman Narayana Murthy has taken the company from 500 employees and $10 million to 50,000 employees worldwide and $2.1 billion in 11 years. Despite its obvious importance to India, 98 percent of Infosys revenue comes from other countries.\nRelations between India and the United States are getting stronger, fueled by such business opportunities, and by immigration. The United States issues more visas to Indians than to citizens of any other country except Mexico.\nWhen President George W. Bush visits India this week, there will be plenty to discuss with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh besides the nuclear agreement that would allow India to receive U.S. technology for its civilian nuclear industry while remaining outside the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. That agreement is hung up on details.\nStill, Nicholas Burns, the U.S. undersecretary of state who has been shuttling between Washington and New Delhi to iron out the differences, has said improving ties with India will be the most important foreign policy initiative of the Bush administration.\nWhen India gained independence from Britain in 1947, Winston Churchill predicted it would never hold together. With 1,640 languages and dialects, 75 political parties and countless religions, the idea of India-ness seems hard to fathom. India's relative stability may be its most admirable achievement.\nThat stability is forever being challenged by India's troubled neighborhood - Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal are all bordering countries - and by internal pressures exacerbated by a still-expanding population.\nEven Murthy of Infosys agrees that all those young people India presents as such a great resource could drag the country down if illiteracy, poverty, and disease are not reversed. \"The demographic dividend could become a demographic disaster,\" he said.\nOnly if India finds a way to reconcile growth and equity can its moment as a true world power arrive.\n(ReneA\u0303\u0083A\u0302\u00a9 Loth is the editorial page editor of The Boston Globe, where this article first appeared.) \n",

    "text": "A Small Charity Takes Lead in Fighting a Disease\n2006-07-31T04:00:00.000Z\nPATNA, India \u2014 The drug that could have cured Munia Devi through a series of cheap injections was identified decades ago but then died in the research pipeline because there was no profit in it. \nSo Mrs. Devi lay limp in a hospital bed here recently, her spleen and liver bulging from under her rib cage as a bilious yellow liquid dripped into her thin arm. The treatment she was receiving can be toxic, and it costs $500. But it was her best hope to cure black fever, a disease known locally as kala azar, which kills an estimated half-million people worldwide each year, almost all of them poor like Mrs. Devi. \nSoon, however, all that may change. A small charity based in San Francisco has conducted the medical trials needed to prove that the drug is safe and effective. Now it is on the verge of getting final approval from the Indian government. A course of treatment with the drug is expected to cost just $10, and experts say it could virtually eliminate the disease. \nIf approval is granted as expected this fall, it will be the first time a charity has succeeded in ushering a drug to market.\nThis novel way of helping people whose needs have not been met by for-profit pharmaceutical companies is gaining traction. Several partnerships are working to develop drugs to fight neglected diseases, underwritten by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Doctors Without Borders and other groups. Another nonprofit agency, the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation, is searching for a means to prevent tuberculosis. \nFor its first project, the San Francisco charity, the Institute for OneWorld Health, focused on reclaiming the all but abandoned drug, paromomycin, which research found promising in the 1960\u2019s. \nThat was the easy part. Its hurdles lay elsewhere. The Internal Revenue Service at first denied the charity nonprofit status, concerned that it looked too much like a for-profit enterprise. The World Health Organization, which controlled the drug, was reluctant to hand over the data needed for further development. And OneWorld Health had to set up clinical trials matching United States and European standards in one of the poorest parts of the world.\nNor was it obvious where the money would come from. The idea of a nonprofit drug company struck many as folly when Dr. Victoria Hale, a former Genentech executive and Food and Drug Administration official, founded OneWorld Health in 2001. So Dr. Hale and her husband started the project using their own money, though they have since won support from the Gates foundation, among others. \n\u201cMy colleagues and mentors in the pharmaceuticals industry told me it was a wild idea, that it would never work out, that I was jeopardizing my reputation,\u201d Dr. Hale said. \u201cI started this organization knowing our first project had to be a winner or we wouldn\u2019t survive.\u201d\nAn Ambitious Goal\nDr. Hale hopes to stamp out black fever eventually, a goal that many doctors regard as impossible. \u201cThe last disease we truly eradicated was smallpox,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no urgency to eradicating diseases anymore. Why not?\u201d\nBlack fever is the second-largest parasitic killer in the world after malaria. It is spread by sand flies, and Banthu, the squalid village about an hour\u2019s drive from here that Mrs. Devi calls home, is an ideal breeding ground for them. \nThe flies multiply in the cow dung that Mrs. Devi uses as fuel for cooking. They relish the sap in the banana groves and bamboo stands, and they thrive in the thatch used to make the tiny houses. Flies that have bitten infected humans transmit the disease when they bite another person. Smaller than mosquitoes, they can pass through most netting. \nRoughly 90 percent of black fever cases worldwide are found here in Bihar State in India and in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sudan and northeastern Brazil.\nMrs. Devi\u2019s daughter was the first in the family to contract the disease, and she died from it. Then Mrs. Devi\u2019s youngest son, Rajesh, got it, and she brought him to the Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Science here, where he was treated and recovered. Now she, too, is receiving treatment. \nIt is at the Rajendra Institute, a government research facility, that OneWorld Health set up one of the trials needed to make paromomycin widely available.\nMany Early Battles\nDr. Hale first set her sights on the drug after she attended a conference in Belgium in 1999, where Dr. Shyam Sundar, an expert on black fever, was railing against the world\u2019s failure to fight the disease.\n\u201cThe tragedy, maybe even the crime, is that we have known that this drug is an effective treatment for kala azar since the 1960\u2019s,\u201d said Dr. Sundar, whose free clinic in Muzaffarpur was also a site for a trial by OneWorld Health. \u201cWe could do something, but we were choosing not to.\u201d \nAfter visiting Dr. Sundar\u2019s clinic in 2000, Dr. Hale, who was doing consulting work at the time, hired a law firm to help her get the tax exemption necessary to create a nonprofit drug company. The I.R.S. turned her down three times over 10 months, suspicious that her plan was a scheme by the drug industry to shelter profits. The tax agency challenged her to find an example of an existing charity that mirrored a for-profit business. \n\u201cIt took me five days, and then at dinner, it hit me: N.P.R. and public television,\u201d she said. \u201cThey look an awful lot like for-profit radio and television, but they serve a different audience with programs that their for-profit counterparts don\u2019t provide because they can\u2019t profit from them.\u201d \nTwo weeks later, OneWorld Health received I.R.S. approval and set out to tackle black fever.\nThe immediate challenge was financing. For a time, OneWorld Health survived on the largesse of Dr. Hale and her husband, Dr. Ahvie Herskowitz. They put up $100,000, signed a $315,000 promissory note, used the ground floor of their house as offices, and worked without pay for two years. \nThe Gates foundation, which at the time was primarily underwriting vaccines and other preventive strategies, eventually offered a grant of $4.2 million that grew to $47.2 million for the development of paromomycin. Dr. Hale also got help from others, including the Skoll Foundation, which has provided financing to underwrite salaries for new senior executives. \nAn Abandoned Drug\nAn initial, formal test of paromomycin, an antibiotic sold in some countries as an oral treatment for diarrhea and as a topical treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis, which causes lesions, was done in the late 1980\u2019s in Africa, two decades after it was identified as a simple, cheap, effective cure for black fever. \nThrough a series of company mergers it was consigned to the corporate shelf and forgotten, ending up with the World Health Organization, which lacked the money to develop it beyond the Phase II clinical trials.\nBut negotiations with the World Health Organization to hand over the data that would allow OneWorld Health to organize the Phase III clinical trials necessary for regulatory approval dragged on for almost two years. At the time, the W.H.O was developing another drug for black fever with Zentaris, a large pharmaceutical company, and the Indian government. That drug, miltefosine, has the advantage of being an oral treatment, while paromomycin is administered by injection.\nBut miltefosine, an anticancer drug, also has drawbacks. In trials, it caused gastrointestinal problems in one-third of the patients. And patients must be strictly supervised to ensure that they take the full 21-day course of treatment and that women of child-bearing age are using birth control. By contrast, paromomycin has shown almost no side effects in trials. \nWith a price of $100 to $200 a treatment, miltefosine is out of reach for most patients and government purchasing programs.\nDr. T. K. Jha, a specialist in black fever who oversaw one of the OneWorld Health trials, said the W.H.O. wanted to make sure miltefosine made it onto the market before handing over its data on paromomycin. \u201cCommerce got in the way,\u201d Dr. Jha said. \nBut Dr. Robert G. Ridley, director of the W.H.O.\u2019s special program for research and training in tropical diseases, disputed that. Dr. Ridley wrote in an e-mail message that the \u201ctime lag\u201d had to do with getting financing from the Gates foundation and the process of negotiating an agreement with OneWorld Health. \nThe subject of the commercial aspects of drugs is a difficult one for OneWorld Health, which is careful to avoid criticism of its for-profit cousins, as well as competition with them. \n\u201cWe look a lot like each other,\u201d Dr. Herskowitz said. \u201cBut we fill a gap pharma companies cannot because they have to make a profit.\u201d\nBut given the choice of paying more than $100 for Zentaris\u2019s miltefosine or $10 for paromomycin, governments and most patients will no doubt choose the cheaper drug. \nOneWorld Health does not intend to gain income from the drug. It has given a license to Gland Pharma, an Indian drug company that has agreed to manufacture the drug and sell it at cost when it is approved. But Dr. Hale can foresee a time when, say, a drug OneWorld Health hopes to develop to treat childhood diarrhea could be sold to travelers by a for-profit drug maker in exchange for royalties that would help sustain her organization\u2019s charitable work. \nStill More Difficulties\nApproval of paromomycin will not end OneWorld Health\u2019s challenges. Distribution looms as the next hurdle. \nIn Patepur, a somewhat more prosperous village than Mrs. Devi\u2019s, Dr. Syed Misbah Hassan, a clinical research coordinator for OneWorld Health, diagnosed kala azar in one boy after another. \nDilip Manjhi, who is about 15, lay listless on a string bed as Dr. Hassan examined his abdomen for the telltale signs of the disease, a swollen spleen and liver. Dilip\u2019s spleen extended eight centimeters below his rib cage and was rock hard. His liver protruded three centimeters below his ribs. \nGetting paromomycin to remote villages like Patepur at the end of pothole-pocked roads will be difficult. Dr. Hale is trying to enlist a British nonprofit group, Riders for Health, to help. The group uses motorcycles to connect poor people to medical services. In Zimbabwe, for instance, it has taken pregnant women in need of Caesarean sections to hospitals. \n\u201cMy thinking,\u201d Dr. Hale said, \u201cis that we could equip a motorcycle with a cooler to transport the drug and equip the driver to give the injections and maintain records.\u201d\nBut first, the Bihar State government and India\u2019s central government must create a system that encompasses diagnosing the disease, buying and administering the drug, keeping records and spraying to reduce the sand fly population.\nSome experts wonder whether the government has the will to create such a system, when hundreds of thousands of Indian children die each year of measles, which can be prevented with a 15-cent vaccine. But Dr. C. P. Thakur, a former Indian health minister who oversaw a OneWorld Health trial of paromomycin, noted that black fever was one of five insect-borne diseases the Indian government had pledged to eliminate. \nIndia has also signed an agreement with the governments of Nepal and Bangladesh to eradicate the disease, and the Bihar State government has shown a willingness to work with OneWorld Health. \n\u201cThe government will be the biggest challenge,\u201d Dr. Thakur said. \u201cBut I believe the opportunities to end this disease have never been better, and also that the government\u2019s will has never been stronger.\u201d",

    "text": "Egyptian Mobile Phone Provider Treads Where Others Dare Not\n2006-02-13T05:00:00.000Z\nCAIRO - From an office on the 26th floor of his family's gold-domed twin towers overlooking the Nile, Naguib Sawiris, chief executive of Orascom Telecom, scans the world for opportunities to expand his telecommunications empire. He tends to find them in places others fear to tread.\nTake, for instance, Orascom's $160 million investment in Iraqna, the first mobile phone provider in Iraq. Iraqna operates in the volatile central provinces of Baghdad, Anbar and Diyala. Its employees have been kidnapped and its outlets have been attacked, pushing the company's annual security costs to $30 million.\nBut two years after it introduced service, Iraqna has 1.5 million subscribers, or 41 percent of the current Iraqi market. In the first nine months of 2005, the company generated $249 million in revenue.\n\"Wherever the risk is high, the profits are also high,\" said Mr. Sawiris, 50, the son of an Egyptian construction magnate. \"Soon we will reach two million subscribers in our network.\"\nThe only major difference between doing business in Iraq and any other place in the world, said Mr. Sawiris, is having to negotiate with kidnappers. \"We know that calm will come one day and Iraq will be a second Saudi Arabia,\" he said. \"In the mobile telecom business, we invest where the service is needed and we can create value.\"\nIraqna is just one example of a drive by Orascom into emerging markets in Asia and the Middle East. The company has a subscriber base of 30 million people in Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Tunisia and Zimbabwe, among other countries. Those countries represent a market of 460 million people, but on average only 11.5 percent of them have mobile phones.\nIn 2005, the company more than doubled its subscriber base, and it is on target to reach 50 million subscribers by the end of 2006. Orascom's net income was $298 million in 2004, up 184 percent from 2003. Income in the first half of 2005 was $296 million, up 49 percent from the same period a year earlier.\nMr. Sawiris said he approached each market the same way, through quick decisions and network-building. In 2003, the Coalition Provisional Authority, the United States-led civil administration in Iraq, awarded a two-year operating license to Orascom Telecom, one of three cellphone companies to receive licenses. Mr. Sawiris embarked on a network construction spree and an intensive advertising campaign, and dotted Iraqi cities with distributor outlets.\n\"He has the companies that sell the network,\" said Wael Zaida, a senior analyst with EFG-Hermes, a brokerage house based in Egypt. \"He has the companies that provide the handsets. All he needed is a license to start operations.\n\"Despite the high risk involved in putting an operation in Iraq, it is the Iraqi operation that has been doing fantastically well,\" Mr. Zaida said.\nOrascom has weathered its share of reversals, and Mr. Sawiris admits to having made some mistakes. He says that his business partner in Syria, a cousin of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, took over the partnership for his own benefit, prompting Orascom to pull up its stake and arbitrate the dispute, settling for $20 million. After similar problems in Yemen, Mr. Sawiris decided he would never again enter into partnerships with those who have close ties with a country's leadership.\nOrascom moved into 22 countries between 1999 and 2002, but that rapid expansion led to ballooning short-term debt. Mr. Sawiris decided to sell most of Orascom's African holdings as well as its Jordanian subsidiary, Fastlink, even though it had been performing well.\nIn May, Mr. Sawiris moved into the European market, paying $3.6 billion to take control of Wind, a leading phone company in Italy. To limit Orascom's debt burden, Mr. Sawiris made a leveraged purchase by fusing personal and family funds; he created a buyout vehicle called Weather Investments in partnership with Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the American buyout specialist, and Philippe Nguyen, a French financier.\nThe Wind deal \"was an opportunity to gain a foothold in Europe,\" Mr. Sawiris said. He has also shown interest in buying TIM Hellas Telecommunications, a Greek operator. \"I am convinced that telecoms will consolidate and I do not want to sell off my companies,\" Mr. Sawiris said. \"I want to be one of these players at the end of the game.\"\nIn December 2005, Orascom paid $1.3 billion for a 19.3 percent stake in Hutchison Telecommunications International, a unit of the Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa. Mr. Sawiris said the deal was part of an effort to take a slice of the Southeast Asian market, which he said he wished he had entered earlier.\nThough the strategy of investing in emerging markets is risky, other companies have taken the same path as Orascom. \"Those countries have more resources than you read, because of the gray economy and the cash economy,\" said Azmi T. Mikati, chief executive of Investcom Holding, a mobile communications provider that operates in countries like Sudan, Syria and Afghanistan. \"These countries are not as poor or as dangerous as they are portrayed.\"\nMr. Sawiris says that people do not fully understand the needs of his customers. \"Whether poor or rich, people still need to communicate,\" he said.",

    "text": "American World Order\n2006-03-05T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE CASE FOR GOLIATH\nHow America Acts as the World's\nGovernment in the Twenty-First Century.\nBy Michael Mandelbaum.\n283 pp. PublicAffairs. $26.\nMICHAEL MANDELBAUM has taken all the fun out of an ostensibly flippant but fundamentally serious diplomatic parlor game. Usually played late at night when the Americans have gone home to prepare for their puritanically early start to the day, the Europeans, Latin Americans and Asians take a second glass of Cognac and imagine how awful the world could be if someone else were to take the place of the United States as the global hegemon.\nEastern Europeans tell sad anecdotes about living under Russian dominance. Western Europeans shudder at the thought of Germans running the benign and virtual empire that the United States has maintained and expanded for the past 60 years. (And they murmur that within the European Union the French are already being difficult enough.) The Latin Americans have their hands full with the arrogance of next-door neighbors like Brazil without wanting to see it become even more dominant. The idea of a Chinese hegemony sends shivers down the backs of all, particularly the Japanese and Indians; somebody usually mentions the mournful example of Tibet. The Pakistanis, Sri Lankans and Bangladeshis react equally unhappily to the idea of India as superpower. As the diplomats prattle on, meanwhile, the British smile wryly and say they have been there, done that and are extremely glad to have lost the T-shirt.\nMandelbaum, the Christian A. Herter professor of American foreign policy at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, pulls aside the curtain of diplomatic civility to expose the crude and obvious reality that everyone prefers to ignore, at least in public. He explains coolly and clearly the various ways in which the United States now functions as a global government, offering the planet the services of physical security, commercial regulation, financial stability and legal recourse that are normally provided by national governments to their citizens. Non-Americans naturally do not like to admit this, even as they enjoy the results, and American leaders do not like to spell it out, least of all to the voters who pay for it. But the evidence is clear. The network of military alliances (like NATO) and trade pacts (like the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) and international organizations (like the United Nations and World Bank and Group of 8) that the United States was mainly responsible for bringing to life has become an American-led global management system. It is familiar, inclusive and fairly unobtrusive. Its institutions provide a reasonable role for lesser powers, which is why the NATO alliance of consent survived and expanded while the wretched conscripts of the Warsaw Pact rebelled.\nAbove all, this system has been a remarkable and seductive economic success. Having built the tripartite trading structure of the modern world (North America, Western Europe and Japan) to enrich its citizens and allies and sustain the cold war, the generous Americans have expanded it to include the Asian tigers and Eastern Europeans. Now 1.3 billion Chinese and 1.1 billion Indians are clambering up the food chain to prosperity. They deal in dollars, raise money in the New York and London financial markets, generate big trade surpluses with the United States and then send their brighter and most ambitious children to American graduate and business schools, where they are exposed to the creeping osmosis of the Western value system. This is a magnificently benign loop, and will continue to be so once those American-trained graduates figure out how the biosphere is going to handle tens of millions of Asians living the American lifestyle, with their own cars and air conditioning and fast food.\nThis international system, an improved and democratized version of the clunky British model that brought us the 19th-century wave of globalization, is designed to operate to American comfort and profit, while securing compliance by sharing security and prosperity with others. But it is no longer doing so quite as reliably as it once did. Trade imbalances and the Bush administration's fiscal policies are putting it in jeopardy. Mandelbaum says the American pattern of energy consumption is \"the worst 21st-century international offense of the United States.\" He adds that \"the greatest threat to the American role as the world's government comes not from the discontent it generates in other countries, or from the assaults of terrorists, but from the huge bill for social spending that the American public will have to pay in the 21st century, a responsibility that has the potential to transform American politics in other ways unfavorable to the continuation of that role.\"\nMoreover, traditional beneficiaries of the American system increasingly complain that the United States is no longer running it well. The first sign of the British system's global utility was its suppression of piracy in the 18th century and of the slave trade in the 19th. Even with the world's largest and most technologically advanced navy, the United States is no longer effectively policing the world's seas. Piracy is rife in the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean and around the Strait of Malacca, and America's stewardship is failing in important areas like climate change and drug trafficking. The global governor has some fairly basic global responsibilities, which include enforcing the rules that everyone has to obey, Americans included. That is why the rest of the world is angry at the Bush administration's rejection of the International Criminal Court, and its use of the aid weapon to punish small countries that refuse to grant Americans a waiver from the court's provisions.\nMandelbaum does not dwell overlong on the grisly intervention in Iraq, but he is confident that while the world grumbles, it will tolerate Goliath's occasional misadventures, so long as it retains a broader respect for the United States as the indispensable stabilizing power. America survived the ignominy of the 1960's, when Vietnam and Selma and Watts combined to discredit its international image and it became fashionable to talk of a moral equivalence between the United States and the Soviet Union. The country is undergoing a similar travail today, made the more offensive and glaring in foreign eyes by the Bush administration's clumsy abuse of power. The White House has crudely dispensed with the founding fathers' \"decent respect for the opinions of mankind\" to tell the inhabitants of the rest of the world that they are either with Washington or against it.\nNonetheless, as Mandelbaum argues, there is no credible alternative to the American role as linchpin and guarantor of the global system. Nobody else has the political will, the military and economic clout and the ability to generate sufficient international consent. Rising regional powers like China, Brazil and the European Union may be jostling to win some more room to maneuver, and the global crowd may be grousing more fiercely about the performance of the American Goliath, but as Mandelbaum shows, the most serious threats are being generated at home. This is what worries the players of the late-night parlor games, because however long the American-led system may last, they would most fervently agree with Mandelbaum's three closing predictions: \"They will not pay for it; they will continue to criticize it; and they will miss it when it is gone.\"\n'The Case for Goliath,' by Michael Mandelbaum Martin Walker is the editor of United Press International and a senior fellow of the World Policy Institute at the New School.",

    "text": "2006 ushered in across the world\n2006-01-01T05:00:00.000Z\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of New Year's revelers rang in 2006 from Times Square as the famous crystal ball dropped on the final seconds of the weary and battered old year.\n\"Now bring on peace and happiness!\" exclaimed Tarra Meaders, visiting from Arlington, Texas, as the crowd burst into cheers at the stroke of midnight.Londoners ignored a subway strike to welcome the New Year. Some Japanese climbed a snowcapped peak to see the first sunrise of 2006. GIs in Iraq got a year-end \"American Idol\" treat.\nNew Year's Celebrations like these spread throughout the world Saturday and early Sunday and were generally jubilant, a contrast with last year when the devastation of the Indian Ocean tsunami led many countries and individuals to cancel festivities.\nIn parts of Asia, the threat of terrorism loomed large, and a bombing at a market in Indonesia killed eight people and wounded 45.\nAs confetti rained down and the numbers 2006 lit up over Times Square, the massive crowd stretching more than 10 blocks up Broadway and the surrounding streets sang \"Auld Lang Syne\" as one voice.\nIn Boston, First Night celebration organizers estimated more than 1 million people were in the city to celebrate the new year.\nThe theme in Boston was Mardi Gras, in honor of hurricane-ravaged New Orleans. The \"Spirit of New Orleans\" parade featured carnival masks, and jazz bands joined in.\nNew Orleans itself started the New Year's celebration with a traditionally festive jazz funeral procession in memory of its hurricane victims. Despite the devastation, the city decided to welcome 2006 with concerts and a lowering of a giant gumbo pot to mark the start of the new year.\nRevelers were urged not to light fireworks out of fear that they would ignite dead vegetation and debris still piled throughout the city or the blue plastic tarps draped over thousands of damaged roofs.\nIn Los Angeles, a concert party expected to draw 20,000 revelers to six downtown blocks was canceled hours before it was scheduled to begin. Fire officials said they had safety concerns as a drenching storm moved through the region.\nThe Black Eyed Peas, Death Cab for Cutie and other groups were scheduled to perform; organizers said on their Web site they would hold a makeup event.Flooding from storms in the West forced Reno, Nevada, to move its New Year's Eve fireworks back a day to Monday, but the mayor still promised to lead a New Year's Eve countdown.\nLas Vegas, meanwhile, kept in character \u2014 everything to excess \u2014 with the Strip's drunken revelry, a mass simultaneous New Year's Eve toast, complete with 14,000 plastic cups and some 200 cases of Chardonnay, and an annual blowout billed as the largest New Year's Eve party outside New York.\nIn France, youths burned hundreds of cars in a traditional year-end form of vandalism, but the country appeared to have avoided a massive resurgence of the rioting that broke out this fall.\nBy 10 a.m. (0900 GMT) Sunday, police counted 425 vehicles burned \u2014 up from the 333 reported last year, police said. They also arrested 266 people, but it wasn't clear if the arrests were linked to the vandalism.\nHundreds of American soldiers in Iraq got a special show from \"American Idol\" singer Diana DeGarmo and other entertainers at Camp Victory in Baghdad.London saw many subway workers walk out at noon, but staff not affiliated with the striking RMT union kept much of the sprawling Tube network running.Thousands of partygoers gathered in Trafalgar Square and outside the Houses of Parliament, to hear Big Ben chime midnight. \"We wanted to come because it's a once in a lifetime thing,\" said Carol Joyce, 43, who traveled from northern England for the festivities and was unaffected by the strike.\nRevelers lined the banks of the River Thames to watch a massive fireworks display set against the backdrop of the giant, futuristic Ferris wheel, the London Eye.\nIn Australia, revelers jostled for vantage points around Sydney's harbor to watch a spectacular fireworks show at midnight.\n\"You can't beat the setting,\" said Andrew Coomer, a 21-year-old English tourist who camped with his family outside the Sydney Opera House for 12 hours to catch the fireworks.\nHundreds of thousands of Brazilians were jamming Rio de Janeiro's famed Copacabana Beach for the largest fireworks extravaganza in the city's history. Officials were setting off 25 tons of fireworks.\nA bomb thought to be the work of Islamic extremists ripped through a crowded market frequented by Christians in Palu on Indonesia's Sulawesi Island, killing eight people and wounding 45. The island has been plagued by religious violence and terrorism by radical Muslims.\nIn Bangladesh, 5,000 security officers searched cars and patrolled the streets of the capital to thwart possible violence in the wake of a series of bombings blamed on Islamic extremists that have killed at least 26 people.\nFor the millions left homeless by this year's South Asian quake, the new year was expected to begin with heavy snow and rain. Relief agencies warned that the harsh Himalayan winter could hamper aid deliveries and create conditions ripe for illnesses.\nPakistan's army and aid workers have been using helicopters, trucks and mules to get tents, clothes, food and other provisions to survivors since the Oct. 8 quake killed an estimated 87,000 people and destroyed the homes of 3.5 million others.\nIn Japan, police said thousands of people were climbing the 12,387-foot (3,716-meter), snowcapped Mount Fuji and other mountains before dawn to see the first sunrise of the new year.\nBut a new holiday pastime also has emerged among Japanese \u2014 watching professional wrestling on TV \u2014 and many rang people in the new year glued to their sets.\n",

    "text": "Villagers Cheer as Lebanese Army Marches South\n2006-08-19T04:00:00.000Z\nBEIRUT, Lebanon, Aug. 18 \u0097 Villagers danced in the streets and threw rice on Friday as the Lebanese Army\u2019s soldiers reached the southern border with Israel for the first time in decades, and Hezbollah volunteers handed out grants of $12,000 \u0097 in stacks of American dollars \u0097 as part of its vigorous campaign to help families whose houses were destroyed over the past month.\nMass funerals were held across southern Lebanon for hundreds of people killed in the bombings, including scores of Hezbollah fighters who were hailed as heroes and martyrs. Ambulances, sirens wailing, made way for funeral processions, and the stench of death pervaded the streets. In Tyre, almost 200 bodies were dug up from a temporary mass grave and reburied individually.\nThe funerals, mostly arranged by Hezbollah, illustrated the group\u2019s near-total power over southern Lebanon and underscored the uncertainty of the Lebanese Army\u2019s new mission there. Israel and the United States have said they expect the Lebanese Army to disarm Hezbollah under the terms of a United Nations Security Council resolution.\nBut even as southern residents cheered the arriving soldiers, Hezbollah banners waved nearby. The group\u2019s members have said they have no intention of giving up their weapons for now. Government officials have made clear that the 15,000 soldiers being sent to southern Lebanon will not search for weapons. The United Nations peacekeepers expected to join the Lebanese Army will not do any disarming either, United Nations officials say.\n[On Saturday morning, Israeli warplanes crisscrossed the skies above Lebanon\u2019s eastern Bekaa Valley, near the Hezbollah stronghold of Baalbek, security officials told The Associated Press. Reuters quoted a security source and Hezbollah radio as saying there had been an airstrike, but those reports were not confirmed and the Israeli Army had no immediate comment.[Such an assault would be the first aerial attack since a cease-fire took effect on Monday.]\nAt the United Nations on Friday, diplomats scrambled to meet a deadline to get the first 3,500-troop detachment of that force on the ground in 10 days, and Mark Malloch Brown, the deputy secretary general, appealed for more input from Europe.\n On Thursday, France committed 200 soldiers, far fewer than expected, while the countries offering frontline mechanized units were Bangladesh, Indonesia and Malaysia, all Muslim, and Nepal, which is largely Hindu.\n \u201cThat is enormously helpful and a major contribution,\u201d Mr. Malloch Brown said, \u201cbut we want this force that we deploy to have a kind of multinational, multilateral character so that it enjoys the confidence of both sides.\u201d\nWhatever the fate of its weapons, Hezbollah has already asserted itself across the south with aid ahead of international agencies. It took its program a step further on Friday, making good on a pledge of cash for displaced families. With more than 200,000 residents of the capital\u2019s Shiite southern suburbs already back in the area, the group began giving out the grants of $12,000 \u0097 a huge sum in Lebanon, where an apartment big enough for a small family can be rented for $300 a month.\nLebanese political figures have begun reacting to Hezbollah\u2019s new popularity, breaking the facade of national unity that largely held during the month of war with Israel. On Thursday, the Druse leader Walid Jumblatt, told reporters, \u201cHezbollah must decide once and for all whether it is a Lebanese organization or a tool of Syria and Iran.\u201d\nMr. Jumblatt, a leader of the fragile secular coalition that holds a narrow majority in the Lebanese Parliament, ridiculed the new arrangement in the south, saying it had not changed Hezbollah\u2019s role. \u201cAt any time Israel can launch a pre-emptive attack, and now, as the Lebanese state, we are responsible for the south,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the Lebanese Army in such a case will just vanish in a couple of hours.\u201d\nBut Mr. Jumblatt stopped short of forcefully calling for Hezbollah\u2019s disarmament, saying instead that he favored \u201cdialogue.\u201d That hesitation appeared to reflect the weakness of the secular majority and its vulnerability to accusations that it is too close to Israel and the United States.\nInstead, Mr. Jumblatt reserved his harshest words for Syria, as did Saad Hariri, the leader of the secular parliamentary majority. In a speech this week, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria suggested that Lebanon\u2019s secular leaders favored Israel.\nIn his own speech, to hundreds of supporters, Mr. Hariri, \u201cThe regime in Syria is trading in the blood of the children of Qana, the children of Gaza, and the children of Baghdad.\u201d \nIn a sense, the recriminations were among the signs that life was edging back toward normality, at least in the capital. A few civilian flights resumed Thursday at Beirut\u2019s international airport for the first time since July 13, when Israeli bombs punched holes in the runways. \nBeirut\u2019s downtown, largely vacant over the past month, now has a trickle of pedestrians during the day, and shops and restaurants are reopening.\n\u201cEverything is coming back to life,\u201d said Farah Ambriss, 24, as she walked to meet friends for lunch at an outdoor table on al Maarad Street. \u201cBut we are still afraid because Israeli troops are still in the south.\u201d\nNearby, the owner of Duo, a restaurant, stood outside its glass doors and sandstone pillars, greeting customers. The interior was almost full, but the outdoor tables were empty. \u201cI\u2019ve had 100 people a day for lunch since the cease-fire, said the owner, who gave only his first name, Pierre. \u201cUsually we get 500.\u201d\nMost people are pessimistic, he said. \u201cThe fighting could start again any time,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no clear solution; it\u2019s still gray, neither white nor black.\u201d\nIsrael Arrests Hamas Politician\nRAMALLAH, West Bank, Saturday, Aug. 19 (Reuters) \u0097 Israel seized the Palestinian deputy prime minister, Naser al-Shaer, a top official of the Hamas militant group, at his home on Saturday, the Israeli Army and his wife said.\nDozens of Hamas lawmakers have been in custody since late June.",

    "text": "States push past stalled U.S. minimum wage\n2006-01-02T05:00:00.000Z\nNEW YORK \u2014 With Congress refusingfor almost a decade to increase the national minimum wage in the United States, nearly half of the civilian labor force lives in states where minimums are higher than the one set by the U.S. government.\nSeventeen states and the District of Columbia have acted on their own to set minimum wages higher than the rate of $5.15 an hour set by the U.S. government. This year, lawmakers in many of the remaining states will debate raising their minimum wages. Some states that already have higher minimums than the federal rate will debate further increases and adjustments for inflation.\nThe U.S. minimum wage was last increased in 1997, when it went to the current $5.15 from $4.75 an hour. Since then, efforts in Congress to increase it further have been stymied, largely by Republican lawmakers and business groups arguing that a higher minimum wage would lead employers to cut jobs.\nThwarted by Congress, labor unions and community groups have increasingly focused efforts to obtain increases on the states, and the issue has received more attention there, said Bill Samuel, the legislative director of the national AFL-CIO labor federation.\nOpinion polls show wide public support for an increase in the U.S. minimum wage, which falls far short of the income needed to place a family above the poverty level. Even the chairman of Wal-Mart has endorsed an increase, saying that a worker who is paid the minimum wage cannot afford to shop at his stores.\n\"The public is way ahead of Washington,\" Samuel said. \"They see this as a matter of basic fairness, the underpinning of basic labor law in this country, a floor under wages so we're not competing with Bangladesh.\"\nThe minimum wage has been the subject of fierce ideological debate since it was first established in 1938 as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Fair Labor Standards Act.\nBusiness groups and conservative economists have argued that the minimum wage is an unwarranted government intrusion into the employer-employee relationship and a distortion of the marketplace for labor. An increase in the minimum wage, they say, drives labor costs up across the board and freezes unskilled and first-time workers out of the job market.\n\"Increasing the minimum wage is a bad move economically, philosophically and politically,\" said Marc Freedman, director of labor law policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\nHe said that the people who were supposed to benefit from increasing the minimum - low-skilled working adults - did not benefit. Freedman said that any minimum wage set by the national government was arbitrary and did not take into account the cost of labor in local markets.\n\"The bottom line is, we view it as an imposition of higher labor costs on businesses, particularly small businesses,\" he said.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about two million American workers, 2.7 percent of the overall work force, were paid the national minimum wage or less in 2004, the last year for which such statistics were available. Those workers were generally young and unmarried and had not received high school diplomas. Half were younger than 25 and a quarter were teenagers.\nAbout three-fifths of all workers paid the minimum wage or less worked in bars and restaurants, and many received tips to supplement their basic wages.\nAdvocates of an increase said inflation had so eroded the value of the minimum wage in the past nine years that it was worth less today in real terms than it had been at any other time since 1955.\nThey also cited studies that found increases in the minimum wage did not cause job losses.\nAccording to these studies, employers can absorb the higher labor costs through efficiencies, reduction in employee turnover and increased productivity.\nTim Nesbitt, the former president of the Oregon AFL-CIO, said that despite having one of the highest minimum wages in the country, at $7.25 an hour, Oregon had a job growth rate twice that of the rest of the country.\nThe 2006 battle over the minimum wage is expected to be particularly intense in Ohio, one of two states with minimum wages below the national level (the other is Kansas).\nThe minimum wage in Ohio since 1991 has been $4.25 an hour; it applies to small employers, some farms and most restaurants. Workers at larger enterprises are generally covered by the federal minimum wage.\nEfforts to get the state's Republican-run General Assembly to consider an increase have gone nowhere, so labor groups and the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now are planning a ballot initiative to put the issue to a popular vote in November.\nTim Burga, legislative director for the Ohio AFL-CIO, said that 92,000 workers in the state made less than the national minimum wage, some as little as $2 an hour. The proposed Ohio constitutional amendment would set the state minimum wage at $6.85 an hour and establish a link to future inflation, bringing an immediate raise to as many as 400,000 workers.\nLeading the opposition to the initiative will be the Ohio Restaurant Association, which like its parent group, the National Restaurant Association, closely monitors and vigorously opposes efforts to increase the minimum wage. The groups have argued that minimum wage increases hit owners of restaurants particularly hard.\nOne of those who would be affected by the increase is Rick Cassara, owner of John Q's Steakhouse in Cleveland. He said that while all of his 55 employees are paid more than the minimum wage, he opposed a mandated increase because it would drive up all of his labor costs.\n\"It exerts upward pressure on all wages and prices,\" Cassara said.\n\"If the minimum wage is $7 and I have to pay $8 or $9 to hire a dishwasher, then the cooks are going to say they want more.\n\"How much can I charge for that hamburger?\"",

    "text": "Young Woman Fears Deportation, and Mutilation\n2006-10-26T04:00:00.000Z\n Adama Bah\u2019s schoolmates were jubilant when she returned to 10th grade at Heritage High School in Manhattan in May 2005 after six weeks in a distant juvenile detention center. Her release put to rest the federal government\u2019s unexplained assertion that Adama, a popular 16-year-old who wore jeans under her Islamic garb, was a potential suicide bomber.\n But a year and a half later, with many of her friends planning proms and applying to college, Ms. Bah, now 18, was still wearing an electronic ankle bracelet and tethered to a 10 p.m. government curfew, restrictions that were conditions of her release. And she was still facing deportation to Guinea, where she has not lived since she was 2. \n Today, at a closed hearing in Manhattan\u2019s federal building, she will plead for political asylum from Guinea\u2019s entrenched practice of female genital mutilation, which has marked all the women in her extended family, including her mother. An immigration judge could decide her fate on the spot.\n \u201cI\u2019m worried about being sent back,\u201d Ms. Bah said on Tuesday in her first extended interview about the lasting consequences of a case that briefly became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in the debate over government vigilance and the protection of individual liberties. \u201cI\u2019m worried about being separated from my family. This is all I have left now \u2014 what hasn\u2019t been taken.\u201d\n Officially, she and a 16-year-old Bangladeshi girl arrested in Queens the same day were detained solely because their childhood visas were no longer valid. That remains the only reason Ms. Bah is in deportation proceedings, and the sole legal basis for an order last year that released the other girl, Tashnuba Hayder, on the condition that she leave the country immediately. \nEven now, Ms. Bah says she has no idea whether her slight acquaintance with Ms. Hayder was what caused agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to hold her for questioning. Though a document provided by a federal agent at the time said the F.B.I. considered the girls \u201can imminent threat\u201d to national security, it provided no evidence, and officials refused to discuss the matter.\n \u201cWhy me?\u201d she asked, before her volunteer lawyers warned that a judicial order limits what she can say about the experience. \u201cNobody answers, why me?\u201d\nShe has had little time to dwell on the question, however, because she has been struggling to replace her father as the family\u2019s primary breadwinner. Her father, a cabdriver who was arrested along with her and held on immigration violations, stayed in detention until his deportation last month. Her mother, illiterate and speaking little English, soon lost the family business, a trinket stand.\nBut under the strictures of the government\u2019s curfew, Ms. Bah found she could not continue her education and at the same time earn enough to feed her four younger siblings, all American citizens. Last year, she dropped out of Heritage High, where teachers had praised her intellectual curiosity and generous spirit, and took up office work at Bellevue Hospital Center for $6.75 an hour.\nHer income fell far short of needs.

    "text": "Young Woman Fears Deportation, and Mutilation\n2006-10-26T05:00:00.000Z\nAdama Bah's schoolmates were jubilant when she returned to 10th grade at Heritage High School in Manhattan in May 2005 after six weeks in a distant juvenile detention center. Her release put to rest the federal government's unexplained assertion that Adama, a popular 16-year-old who wore jeans under her Islamic garb, was a potential suicide bomber.\nBut a year and a half later, with many of her friends planning proms and applying to college, Ms. Bah, now 18, was still wearing an electronic ankle bracelet and tethered to a 10 p.m. government curfew, restrictions that were conditions of her release. And she was still facing deportation to Guinea, where she has not lived since she was 2.\nToday, at a closed hearing in Manhattan's federal building, she will plead for political asylum from Guinea's entrenched practice of female genital mutilation, which has marked all the women in her extended family, including her mother. An immigration judge could decide her fate on the spot.\n\"I'm worried about being sent back,\" Ms. Bah said on Tuesday in her first extended interview about the lasting consequences of a case that briefly became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in the debate over government vigilance and the protection of individual liberties. \"I'm worried about being separated from my family. This is all I have left now -- what hasn't been taken.\"\nOfficially, she and a 16-year-old Bangladeshi girl arrested in Queens the same day were detained solely because their childhood visas were no longer valid. That remains the only reason Ms. Bah is in deportation proceedings, and the sole legal basis for an order last year that released the other girl, Tashnuba Hayder, on the condition that she leave the country immediately.\nEven now, Ms. Bah says she has no idea whether her slight acquaintance with Ms. Hayder was what caused agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to hold her for questioning. Though a document provided by a federal agent at the time said the F.B.I. considered the girls \"an imminent threat\" to national security, it provided no evidence, and officials refused to discuss the matter.\n\"Why me?\" she asked, before her volunteer lawyers warned that a judicial order limits what she can say about the experience. \"Nobody answers, why me?\"\nShe has had little time to dwell on the question, however, because she has been struggling to replace her father as the family's primary breadwinner. Her father, a cabdriver who was arrested along with her and held on immigration violations, stayed in detention until his deportation last month. Her mother, illiterate and speaking little English, soon lost the family business, a trinket stand.\nBut under the strictures of the government's curfew, Ms. Bah found she could not continue her education and at the same time earn enough to feed her four younger siblings, all American citizens. Last year, she dropped out of Heritage High, where teachers had praised her intellectual curiosity and generous spirit, and took up office work at Bellevue Hospital Center for $6.75 an hour.\nHer income fell far short of needs. And though a few community agencies tried to help with diapers for the youngest and trips to a food pantry, she said, the financial crisis deepened. In the end, it was an Islamic political activist in Maryland who came through, taking three of Ms. Bah's siblings into his home for the summer, and paying $500 a month toward household expenses so she could attend summer school and re-enroll in Heritage this fall.\n\"We were looking for other options, but nothing was working out,\" Ms. Bah said.

    "text": "How to Fix the Global Economy\n2006-10-03T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE International Monetary Fund meeting in Singapore last month came at a time of increasing worry about the sustainability of global financial imbalances: For how long can the global economy endure America's enormous trade deficits -- the United States borrows close to $3 billion a day -- or China's growing trade surplus of almost $500 million a day?\nThese imbalances simply can't go on forever. The good news is that there is a growing consensus to this effect. The bad news is that no country believes its policies are to blame. The United States points its finger at China's undervalued currency, while the rest of the world singles out the huge American fiscal and trade deficits.\nTo its credit, the International Monetary Fund has started to focus on this issue after 15 years of preoccupation with development and transition. Regrettably, however, the fund's approach has been to monitor every country's economic policies, a strategy that risks addressing symptoms without confronting the larger systemic problem.\nTreating the symptoms could actually make matters worse, at least in the short run. Take, for instance, the question of China's undervalued exchange rate and the country's resulting surplus, which the United States Treasury suggests is at the core of the problem. Even if China strengthened its yuan relative to the dollar and eliminated its $114 billion a year trade surplus with the United States, and even if that immediately translated into a reduction in the American multilateral trade deficit, the United States would still be borrowing more than $2 billion a day: an improvement, but hardly a solution.\nOf course, it is even more likely that there would be no significant change in America's multilateral trade deficit at all. The United States would simply buy fewer textiles from China and more from Bangladesh, Cambodia and other developing countries.\nMeanwhile, because a stronger yuan would make imported American food cheaper in China, the poorest Chinese -- the farmers -- would see their incomes fall as domestic prices for agriculture dipped. China might choose to counter the depressing effect of America's huge agricultural subsidies by diverting money badly needed for industrial development into subsidies for its farmers. China's growth might accordingly be slowed, which would slow growth globally.\nAs it is, however, China knows well the terms of its hidden \"deal\" with the United States: China helps finance the American deficits by buying treasury bonds with the money it gets from its exports. If it doesn't, the dollar will weaken further, which will lower the value of China's dollar reserves (by the end of the year, these will exceed $1 trillion). Any country that might benefit from China's loss of export market share would put its money into a strong currency, like the euro, rather than the unstable and weakening dollar -- or it might choose to invest the money at home, rather than holding more reserves. In short, the United States would find it increasingly difficult to finance its deficits, and the world as a whole might face greater, not less, instability.\nNothing significant can be done about these global imbalances unless the United States attacks its own problems. No one seriously proposes that businesses save money instead of investing in expanding production simply to correct the problem of the trade deficit; and while there may be sermons aplenty about why Americans should save more -- certainly more than the negative amount households saved last year -- no one in either political party has devised a fail-proof way of ensuring that they do so. The Bush tax cuts didn't do it. Expanded incentives for saving didn't do it.\nIndeed, most calculations show that these actually reduce national savings, since the cost to the government in lost revenue is greater than the increased household savings. The common wisdom is that there is but one alternative: reducing the government's deficit.\nImagine that the Bush administration suddenly got religion (at least, the religion of fiscal responsibility) and cut expenditures. Assume that raising taxes is unlikely for an administration that has been arguing for further tax cuts. The expenditure cuts by themselves would lead to a weakening of the American and global economy. The Federal Reserve might try to offset this by lowering interest rates, and this might protect the American economy -- by encouraging debt-ridden American households to try to take even more money out of their home-equity loans to pay for spending. But that would make America's future even more precarious.\nThere is one way out of this seeming impasse: expenditure cuts combined with an increase in taxes on upper-income Americans and a reduction in taxes on lower-income Americans. The expenditure cuts would, of course, by themselves reduce spending, but because poor individuals consume a larger fraction of their income than the rich, the \"switch\" in taxes would, by itself, increase spending. If appropriately designed, such a combination could simultaneously sustain the American economy and reduce the deficit.\nNot surprisingly, these recommendations did not emerge from the International Monetary Fund meetings in Singapore. The United States retains a veto there, making it unlikely that the fund will recommend policies that aren't to the liking of the American administration.\nUnderlying the current imbalances are fundamental structural problems with the global reserve system. John Maynard Keynes called attention to these problems three-quarters of a century ago. His ideas on how to reform the global monetary system, including creating a new reserve system based on a new international currency, can, with a little work, be adapted to today's economy. Until we attack the structural problems, the world is likely to continue to be plagued by imbalances that threaten the financial stability and economic well-being of us all.\nOp-Ed Contributor Joseph E. Stiglitz, a professor of economics at Columbia and the author, most recently, of \"Making Globalization Work,\" was awarded the Nobel in economic science in 2001.",

And the Middle East was no exception. Like European art's dependence on court and church until the Renaissance, Islamic art from the seventh century until the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I was inseparable from political and religious systems of power.\nEven today, for instance, France is unblushingly courting good will in third world countries by devoting its new $295 million Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly to non-Western art. And, with its eye on Muslims at home and abroad, the Louvre is also spending $60 million on an ambitious new wing, scheduled to open in 2009, to house its Islamic collection.\nThe Victoria and Albert's aim is more modest: to tell the story of Islamic art in a concise and digestible fashion - without addressing the present.

    "text": "Villagers Cheer as Lebanese Army Marches South\n2006-08-19T05:00:00.000Z\nBEIRUT, Lebanon, Aug. 18 - Villagers danced in the streets and threw rice on Friday as the Lebanese Army's soldiers reached the southern border with Israel for the first time in decades, and Hezbollah volunteers handed out grants of $12,000 -- in stacks of American dollars -- as part of its vigorous campaign to help families whose houses were destroyed over the past month.\nMass funerals were held across southern Lebanon for hundreds of people killed in the bombings, including scores of Hezbollah fighters who were hailed as heroes and martyrs. Ambulances, sirens wailing, made way for funeral processions, and the stench of death pervaded the streets. In Tyre, almost 200 bodies were dug up from a temporary mass grave and reburied individually.\nThe funerals, mostly arranged by Hezbollah, illustrated the group's near-total power over southern Lebanon and underscored the uncertainty of the Lebanese Army's new mission there. Israel and the United States have said they expect the Lebanese Army to disarm Hezbollah under the terms of a United Nations Security Council resolution.\nBut even as southern residents cheered the arriving soldiers, Hezbollah banners waved nearby. The group's members have said they have no intention of giving up their weapons for now. Government officials have made clear that the 15,000 soldiers being sent to southern Lebanon will not search for weapons. The United Nations peacekeepers expected to join the Lebanese Army will not do any disarming either, United Nations officials say.\n[On Saturday morning, Israeli warplanes crisscrossed the skies above Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley, near the Hezbollah stronghold of Baalbek, security officials told The Associated Press. Reuters quoted a security source and Hezbollah radio as saying there had been an airstrike, but those reports were not confirmed and the Israeli Army had no immediate comment.[Such an assault would be the first aerial attack since a cease-fire took effect on Monday.]\nAt the United Nations on Friday, diplomats scrambled to meet a deadline to get the first 3,500-troop detachment of that force on the ground in 10 days, and Mark Malloch Brown, the deputy secretary general, appealed for more input from Europe.\nOn Thursday, France committed 200 soldiers, far fewer than expected, while the countries offering frontline mechanized units were Bangladesh, Indonesia and Malaysia, all Muslim, and Nepal, which is largely Hindu.\n\"That is enormously helpful and a major contribution,\" Mr. Malloch Brown said, \"but we want this force that we deploy to have a kind of multinational, multilateral character so that it enjoys the confidence of both sides.\"\nWhatever the fate of its weapons, Hezbollah has already asserted itself across the south with aid ahead of international agencies. It took its program a step further on Friday, making good on a pledge of cash for displaced families. With more than 200,000 residents of the capital's Shiite southern suburbs already back in the area, the group began giving out the grants of $12,000 -- a huge sum in Lebanon, where an apartment big enough for a small family can be rented for $300 a month.\nLebanese political figures have begun reacting to Hezbollah's new popularity, breaking the facade of national unity that largely held during the month of war with Israel. On Thursday, the Druse leader Walid Jumblatt, told reporters, \"Hezbollah must decide once and for all whether it is a Lebanese organization or a tool of Syria and Iran.\"\nMr. Jumblatt, a leader of the fragile secular coalition that holds a narrow majority in the Lebanese Parliament, ridiculed the new arrangement in the south, saying it had not changed Hezbollah's role. \"At any time Israel can launch a pre-emptive attack, and now, as the Lebanese state, we are responsible for the south,\" he said. \"And the Lebanese Army in such a case will just vanish in a couple of hours.\"\nBut Mr. Jumblatt stopped short of forcefully calling for Hezbollah's disarmament, saying instead that he favored \"dialogue.\" That hesitation appeared to reflect the weakness of the secular majority and its vulnerability to accusations that it is too close to Israel and the United States.\nInstead, Mr. Jumblatt reserved his harshest words for Syria, as did Saad Hariri, the leader of the secular parliamentary majority. In a speech this week, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria suggested that Lebanon's secular leaders favored Israel.\nIn his own speech, to hundreds of supporters, Mr. Hariri, \"The regime in Syria is trading in the blood of the children of Qana, the children of Gaza, and the children of Baghdad.\"\nIn a sense, the recriminations were among the signs that life was edging back toward normality, at least in the capital. A few civilian flights resumed Thursday at Beirut's international airport for the first time since July 13, when Israeli bombs punched holes in the runways.\nBeirut's downtown, largely vacant over the past month, now has a trickle of pedestrians during the day, and shops and restaurants are reopening.\n\"Everything is coming back to life,\" said Farah Ambriss, 24, as she walked to meet friends for lunch at an outdoor table on al Maarad Street. \"But we are still afraid because Israeli troops are still in the south.\"\nNearby, the owner of Duo, a restaurant, stood outside its glass doors and sandstone pillars, greeting customers. The interior was almost full, but the outdoor tables were empty. \"I've had 100 people a day for lunch since the cease-fire, said the owner, who gave only his first name, Pierre. \"Usually we get 500.\"\nMost people are pessimistic, he said. \"The fighting could start again any time,\" he said. \"There's no clear solution; it's still gray, neither white nor black.\"\nIsrael Arrests Hamas Politician\nRAMALLAH, West Bank, Saturday, Aug. 19 (Reuters) -- Israel seized the Palestinian deputy prime minister, Naser al-Shaer, a top official of the Hamas militant group, at his home on Saturday, the Israeli Army and his wife said.\nDozens of Hamas lawmakers have been in custody since late June.",

    "text": "Britain\u2019s Plans for Addressing Its Muslims\u2019 Concerns Lag\n2006-08-19T05:00:00.000Z\nLONDON, Aug. 18 - After four British Muslims blew up themselves and 52 others in a series of attacks here on July 7 last year, the British government convened a task force of prominent Muslims and pleaded for help in combating homegrown extremism.\nThe group's report came out just before Christmas, thick with recommendations and notable for its bold declaration that the war in Iraq had ignited Muslim anger. But since then, its members say, its ambitious plans have all but gathered dust. Sadiq Khan, a Labor member of Parliament and a member of the panel, said recently that only 3 of the 64 recommendations had been carried out.\nThe government retorted that the number was, in fact, 27. But the skirmish was all too familiar.\nFor years the government has been trying to engage the country's 1.6 million Muslims, and for years it has appeared to lurch from committee to committee, initiative to initiative and strategy to strategy without much to show for its troubles. And even as it has poured money into Muslim community centers, state-run Muslim schools and local Muslim programs, it has had little success in winning over an increasingly skeptical Muslim population.\nThe current Labor government would dearly like to know why, just as it would like to know why the two dozen suspects in what the police say was a terrorist plot to blow up trans-Atlantic airliners are born-and-bred British Muslims.\nIts political opponents, and many Muslims, say the problem comes not only from the government's failure to follow through on myriad initiatives, but also from its inability to understand the complexities of Britain's Muslim population.\n\"In dealing with terrorism, the government is happy to pursue grand, headline-grabbing gestures, and with it draconian and sometimes counterproductive legislation,\" David Davis, the home affairs spokesman for the opposition Conservative Party, said in an e-mail message. \"What it seems less willing, or equipped, to do is the grinding, difficult work of eradicating the root causes of this homegrown cancer in our society.\"\nOne of the problems is that many Muslims say their mistrust of Britain's policies in places like Iraq and Afghanistan has made them doubt the government, period.\n\"I used to go to a lot of consultation things with the government,\" said Joe Ahmed-Dobson, 30, a youth worker and convert to Islam who is the son of Frank Dobson, a former health secretary under Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\"I don't get involved any more, because I think it's complete rubbish,\" he said. \"It's all lip service, all this 'We have to take into account the views of the Muslim community.' The government well knows the opinions of the Muslim community, and it's not going to make a blind bit of difference, so why bother?\"\nAnother problem is that the Muslim leaders the government talks to -- members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, for instance, as well as heads of mosques and representatives of relatively mainstream groups like the Muslim Council of Britain -- are viewed with mistrust, even derision, by many Muslims.\nRoger Ballard, director of the Center for Applied South Asian Studies at the University of Manchester, said many Muslims felt that the so-called community leaders who advised Downing Street were \"feathering their nests and advancing their own special interests, rather than those of the common people.\"\nMr. Ballard said such leaders came from specific political traditions in the Muslim world and did not speak for huge numbers of Muslims, particularly not for the disaffected youths who are more vulnerable to extremism.\nBut such people, adept at telling the establishment what it wants to hear, serve as the benign face of British Islam, he said.\n\"Moderate, in the language of Tony Blair, is 'people who talk a language to us that we find totally acceptable,' \" Mr. Ballard said.\nThe roots of Muslim alienation, and of Britain's inability to address it, go back to the 1960's, when thousands of men from rural Pakistan and Bangladesh moved to Britain to take jobs in the textile mills of the north. Their families eventually followed, but the neighborhoods in which the original immigrants settled -- swaths of places like Burnley, Oldham and Bradford -- remained little pockets of the old country.\nThe government has tried and discarded any number of approaches in response. In 1968, Enoch Powell, then a member of the Conservative opposition in Parliament, set the tone for a generation with his notorious \"Rivers of Blood\" speech in which, arguing that Sikh bus drivers should not be allowed to wear their turbans to work, he said that \"to claim special communal rights leads to a dangerous fragmentation within society.\"\nBut successive governments gradually began pursuing a more tolerant policy of pluralism and multiculturalism, holding the view that having, for instance, separate schools with traditional Muslim attire for Muslim students was integral to Britain's live-and-let-live liberalism.\nIn 2001, Burnley and Oldham erupted in violent riots that exposed the anger of British-born young men of South Asian descent whose white neighbors still casually called them \"Pakis.\" A subsequent report ascribed much of their fury to the shocking extent of segregation and poverty in their neighborhoods.\nAfter the bombings last year the approach changed, as officials began to talk up the virtues of Britishness.

    "text": "Britain\u2019s Plans for Addressing Its Muslims\u2019 Concerns Lag\n2006-08-19T04:00:00.000Z\nLONDON, Aug. 18 \u2014 After four British Muslims blew up themselves and 52 others in a series of attacks here on July 7 last year, the British government convened a task force of prominent Muslims and pleaded for help in combating homegrown extremism. \nThe group\u2019s report came out just before Christmas, thick with recommendations and notable for its bold declaration that the war in Iraq had ignited Muslim anger. But since then, its members say, its ambitious plans have all but gathered dust. Sadiq Khan, a Labor member of Parliament and a member of the panel, said recently that only 3 of the 64 recommendations had been carried out. \nThe government retorted that the number was, in fact, 27. But the skirmish was all too familiar. \nFor years the government has been trying to engage the country\u2019s 1.6 million Muslims, and for years it has appeared to lurch from committee to committee, initiative to initiative and strategy to strategy without much to show for its troubles. And even as it has poured money into Muslim community centers, state-run Muslim schools and local Muslim programs, it has had little success in winning over an increasingly skeptical Muslim population. \nThe current Labor government would dearly like to know why, just as it would like to know why the two dozen suspects in what the police say was a terrorist plot to blow up trans-Atlantic airliners are born-and-bred British Muslims. \nIts political opponents, and many Muslims, say the problem comes not only from the government\u2019s failure to follow through on myriad initiatives, but also from its inability to understand the complexities of Britain\u2019s Muslim population. \n\u201cIn dealing with terrorism, the government is happy to pursue grand, headline-grabbing gestures, and with it draconian and sometimes counterproductive legislation,\u201d David Davis, the home affairs spokesman for the opposition Conservative Party, said in an e-mail message. \u201cWhat it seems less willing, or equipped, to do is the grinding, difficult work of eradicating the root causes of this homegrown cancer in our society.\u201d\nOne of the problems is that many Muslims say their mistrust of Britain\u2019s policies in places like Iraq and Afghanistan has made them doubt the government, period. \n\u201cI used to go to a lot of consultation things with the government,\u201d said Joe Ahmed-Dobson, 30, a youth worker and convert to Islam who is the son of Frank Dobson, a former health secretary under Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n \u201cI don\u2019t get involved any more, because I think it\u2019s complete rubbish,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all lip service, all this \u2018We have to take into account the views of the Muslim community.\u2019 The government well knows the opinions of the Muslim community, and it\u2019s not going to make a blind bit of difference, so why bother?\u201d\nAnother problem is that the Muslim leaders the government talks to \u2014 members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, for instance, as well as heads of mosques and representatives of relatively mainstream groups like the Muslim Council of Britain \u2014 are viewed with mistrust, even derision, by many Muslims. \nRoger Ballard, director of the Center for Applied South Asian Studies at the University of Manchester, said many Muslims felt that the so-called community leaders who advised Downing Street were \u201cfeathering their nests and advancing their own special interests, rather than those of the common people.\u201d \nMr. Ballard said such leaders came from specific political traditions in the Muslim world and did not speak for huge numbers of Muslims, particularly not for the disaffected youths who are more vulnerable to extremism. \nBut such people, adept at telling the establishment what it wants to hear, serve as the benign face of British Islam, he said. \n\u201cModerate, in the language of Tony Blair, is \u2018people who talk a language to us that we find totally acceptable,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Ballard said. \nThe roots of Muslim alienation, and of Britain\u2019s inability to address it, go back to the 1960\u2019s, when thousands of men from rural Pakistan and Bangladesh moved to Britain to take jobs in the textile mills of the north. Their families eventually followed, but the neighborhoods in which the original immigrants settled \u2014 swaths of places like Burnley, Oldham and Bradford \u2014 remained little pockets of the old country. \nThe government has tried and discarded any number of approaches in response. In 1968, Enoch Powell, then a member of the Conservative opposition in Parliament, set the tone for a generation with his notorious \u201cRivers of Blood\u201d speech in which, arguing that Sikh bus drivers should not be allowed to wear their turbans to work, he said that \u201cto claim special communal rights leads to a dangerous fragmentation within society.\u201d \nBut successive governments gradually began pursuing a more tolerant policy of pluralism and multiculturalism, holding the view that having, for instance, separate schools with traditional Muslim attire for Muslim students was integral to Britain\u2019s live-and-let-live liberalism.\n In 2001, Burnley and Oldham erupted in violent riots that exposed the anger of British-born young men of South Asian descent whose white neighbors still casually called them \u201cPakis.\u201d A subsequent report ascribed much of their fury to the shocking extent of segregation and poverty in their neighborhoods. \nAfter the bombings last year the approach changed, as officials began to talk up the virtues of Britishness. Trevor Phillips, chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, suggested that multiculturalism should be replaced with an emphasis on \u201ccommon values.\u201d \nThe Home Office began holding citizenship ceremonies for immigrants and said it would begin requiring new citizens to take tests on British culture and traditions. Hazel Blears, a government minister, said she found the notion of United States-style hyphenated identities \u2014 where people are known as, for instance, Korean-Americans \u2014 \u201cquite interesting.\u201d \nIf such statements appealed to traditional, white Britain, which already felt that multiculturalism had gone too far, thank you very much, it made Muslims feel even more marginalized. \nBut the prime minister\u2019s tone has hardened. He recently declared that the problem of Muslim extremism was not the government\u2019s to solve, despite all its efforts in the past. \n\u201cI profoundly disagree that the problem here is that the government hasn\u2019t acted,\u201d Mr. Blair told a parliamentary committee last month. \u201cYou cannot defeat this extremism through what a government does.

    "text": "In London, the Victoria and Albert\u2019s New Gallery Shows the Islamic World as Oasis, Not Caldron\n2006-08-09T05:00:00.000Z\nLONDON, Aug. 7 - It was not a happy coincidence that the Victoria and Albert Museum's splendidly refurbished Islamic art gallery opened here in late July, just as the Middle East was once again going up in flames.\nAfter all, one of the gallery's aims is to present a largely Western audience with a different image of the Islamic world, one that dwells on its artistic sophistication rather than on the radical stereotypes often reinforced by newspaper headlines.\nCertainly it was with this in mind that Mohammed Jameel, a wealthy Saudi, paid the $9.8 million bill for reinstalling the Victoria and Albert's Islamic collection for the first time in half a century. The display area on the museum's main floor has now been renamed the Jameel Gallery of Islamic Art in memory of Mr. Jameel's parents.\nYet political turmoil in Israel, Gaza, Lebanon, Iraq and beyond only underlines the challenge of using the past to illuminate the present. Put differently, can 400 carefully chosen objects, some dating to the 11th century, provide us with any fresh insight into what is happening in the Middle East today?\nThe question is pertinent because, notably since 9/11, many museums in Europe and the United States have begun highlighting collections and exhibitions of Islamic art as a way of promoting greater understanding and bridging the cultural gap between the Judeo-Christian and Muslim worlds.\nIn Western Europe this strategy also implies recognition that, because of heavy immigration from North Africa, Turkey, Pakistan and Bangladesh, Islam is now also a European religion, and it is therefore important both for Europeans to show respect for Islamic culture and for Muslim immigrants and their children to take pride in their past.\nBut are we asking too much of art, giving it too much political weight?\nClearly, culture has always served as a political tool. Like European art's dependence on court and church until the Renaissance, Islamic art from the seventh century until the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I was inseparable from political and religious systems of power.\nEven today, for instance, France is unblushingly courting goodwill in third world countries by devoting its new $295 million Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly to non-Western art. And with its eye on Muslims at home and abroad, the Louvre is also spending $60 million on an ambitious new wing, scheduled to open in 2009, to house its Islamic collection.\nThe Victoria and Albert's aim is more modest: to tell the story of Islamic art in a concise and digestible fashion, without addressing the present. Yet this approach is also instructive: through the peephole of art, we can see a more complex and subtle world than the rigid, oppressive and inward-looking theocracies promoted by some Muslim extremists today.\nDuring the construction of the Jameel Gallery, the Victoria and Albert showed part of its Islamic collection in the United States, Japan and northern England in a traveling exhibition called \"Palace and Mosque.\" And this title provides the conceptual framework of its new display here: serving both palace and mosque, Islamic art took secular as well as religious forms.\n\"The political character of Islamic art arose because, in the absence of a priesthood, the formative role in its development fell to those who were politically powerful,\" Tim Stanley, senior curator of Middle East collections at the Victoria and Albert, writes in a catalog accompanying \"Palace and Mosque.\" In other words, Islamic art always reflected political realities.\nThese variables included the world outside of Islam. After the death of the Prophet Muhammad in A.D. 632, Islamic art inherited two distinct artistic traditions: those of Christian Byzantium, to the west, and of the Sasanian empire, to the east. Then as the new Muslim empire swept west as far as Spain and, later, east into Asia, it absorbed new influences, notably from China.\nMost of all, though, Islamic art reflected the whims of successive regimes, from the early Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates to the later Safavid, Qajar and Ottoman dynasties. And at these courts, the perceived Islamic ban on figurative art was interpreted differently.\nReligious art invariably respected that rule, relying on calligraphic citations from the Koran and abstract, often geometric, ornamentation. But secular art, which included utilitarian objects like carpets, ceramic vases, ivory caskets, glass jugs and metalwork, frequently showed flora and fauna. Some Muslim rulers even commissioned portraits of themselves. And while calligraphy remained important, it rendered poetry as well as the Koran.\nSuch eclecticism is well illustrated in this small selection of the Victoria and Albert's 10,000-piece Islamic collection. The Jameel Gallery itself, though, has been designed around the so-called Ardabil carpet, which the museum describes as \"the world's oldest dated carpet.\" Measuring 36 by 16 feet and comprising 30 million hand-tied knots, it was made about 1539-40 for the Ardabil mosque in what is now northwest Iran.\nIn the past the carpet was hung vertically and was hard to appreciate. Now it has been laid out in the center of the gallery and placed inside a specially constructed case with appropriate lighting. As a carpet destined for religious use, it has an elaborate, nonfigurative design in 10 colors. In contrast, the so-called Chelsea carpet, hanging nearby, also from 16th-century Persia, is alive with flowers, fruits and animals, as if evoking earthly paradise.\nMore unexpected is a 17th-century Christian vestment portraying the Crucifixion, which was made in the style of Islamic art for the use of Armenian priests living in the Persian city of Isfahan. This is also a reminder that the Islamic world included large populations of Christians as well as Jews.\nOther objects require no explanation to be admired: an 11th-century rock crystal ewer from Egypt; a 16th-century Iznik pottery mosque lamp from Istanbul; a 15th-century bowl depicting a Portuguese sailing ship, made in Spain using the lusterware technique invented in Iraq centuries earlier; a 19-foot-high wooden minbar, or pulpit, made in the late 15th century for a Cairo mosque.\nThrough this display, then, a contemporary spotlight is thrown on a long-neglected culture.\nYet, for the Victoria and Albert, this is not exactly new: inspired by the aesthetics of this art, eager to learn from its exquisite designs, the museum acquired most of its collection in the 19th and early 20th centuries, long before the Middle East became a world trouble spot. The Prophet himself is quoted as saying: \"God is beautiful, and he loves beauty.\" In these ugly times, this too may be worth remembering.",

    "text": "Myanmar Is Left in Dark, an Energy-Rich Orphan\n2006-11-17T05:00:00.000Z\nSITTWE, Myanmar \u2014 In the balmy waters of the Bay of Bengal, just off the coast, an Asian energy rush is on. Huge pockets of natural gas have been found. China and India are jostling to sign deals. Plans are afoot to spend billions on new ports and pipelines. \nYet onshore, in towns like this one, not a light is to be seen \u2014 not a street lamp, not a glow in a window \u2014 as women crouch by the roadside at dawn, sorting by candlelight the vegetables they will sell for two cents a bunch at the morning market. \nParaffin and wood are major sources of light and heat. People receive two hours of electricity a day from a military government that is among the world\u2019s most repressive. \nBut attempts at outside pressure to prod the government to address its people\u2019s needs and curb abuses have faltered, in large part because China\u2019s thirst for resources has undermined nearly a decade of American economic sanctions. \nCritics say that Washington\u2019s policy has handed Myanmar, formerly Burma, to China. Still, as President Bush prepares to meet with leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Vietnam on Nov. 17, one topic on his agenda will be how to keep up the pressure. He is not likely to find cooperation, not from rivals like China and Russia, nor even countries like Singapore and Indonesia, which trade freely with Myanmar. \nThe Asian energy rush is the latest demonstration of how the hunt for oil and gas, and China\u2019s economic leverage, are reshaping international politics, often in ways that run counter to American preferences. \nIn many respects, with the rise of China\u2019s economic power and its unflagging support, the government here has become more entrenched than ever, people inside and outside the country say. \n \u201cWhat can we do about it?\u201d said a well educated man here, when asked about the plans to sell the gas abroad in the face of the deprivation at home. \u201cWhat good would it do to protest, what would we get?\u201d People were too afraid of the 400,000-member strong army supplied by China, Russia and Ukraine to complain, he said. \n In numerous encounters in Myanmar, where most speak with extreme caution to foreigners and almost always anonymously for fear of jail, people joked sardonically that China was the \u201cbig daddy\u201d and that soon it would \u201cown\u201d Myanmar. \u201cChina is a good friend of the government, not of the people,\u201d one woman said. \u201cThey are like brother and brother-in-law.\u201d \n The Bush administration has pledged that it will not let up on its sanctions against the government until it releases the opposition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been under house arrest for 11 of the past 17 years. \nMrs. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s political party won an overwhelming victory in elections in 1990, and Washington insists that the government recognize those results, and release an estimated 1,100 political prisoners. \n The Bush administration says it plans to file a Security Council resolution at the United Nations in coming weeks condemning the government for its human rights abuses, and tightening sanctions further. \n The United Nations under secretary general, Ibrahim Gambari, met with the junta leader, Gen. Than Shwe, on Nov. 11 in Myanmar and urged the government to mend its ways on forced labor and political prisoners. The meeting ended inconclusively, United Nations officials said. \nWith so much energy and other resources at stake, and given its preference to shun outside interference in internal politics, China\u2019s leaders are seemingly unbothered by what is happening inside Myanmar. \n China\u2019s National Development Reform Commission approved plans in April to build a pipeline that would carry China\u2019s Middle East oil from a deep water port off Sittwe across Myanmar to Yunnan, China\u2019s southern province. This would provide China with an alternative to the Strait of Malacca, which it now depends on for delivering its oil from the Middle East. \n Though no date has been announced for work on the new pipeline across Myanmar, the military appeared to be getting ready to build the deep sea port on the island of Ramree, to the south of here, local people said. \n In another sign of the importance of Myanmar to China, the chairman of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, Fu Chengyu, said in a speech this year that the company would focus its investment in the medium term on two countries: Myanmar and Nigeria. Engineers at the company, known as Cnooc, are currently exploring for oil on Ramree, and the company has rights to other oil deposits in central Myanmar, according to Myanmar government reports. \n India, thirsty for energy to fuel its own fast-growing economy, sees Myanmar as a place where it needs to contain China. In the late 1990s, democratic India switched its policy toward Myanmar from antagonism to friendship. \nAnd Thailand, Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy, spends about $1.2 billion a year for Myanmar\u2019s natural gas, giving the military government badly needed hard currency. \nIn conversations with people in a number of towns, a portrait emerged of a universally unpopular, deeply corrupt government. People told of worsening poverty, a collapsed education system and a health care system that could deal only with those who paid. Tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS were rampant, they said. \nThe government\u2019s budget for its AIDS program in 2004 was $22,000, according to a recent health survey by John Hopkins University Medical School.\nThe junta leader, Gen. Than Shwe, 73, whose early military training was in psychological warfare, was described by many here as a master manipulator of his minions. He insisted, apparently out of fear of a coup, that the capital be moved this year from Yangon, formerly Rangoon, to a new site in the jungle, Naypyidaw. \n The move, costing millions of scarce dollars, was in step with the general\u2019s belief that he marched in the footsteps of the old Burmese kings \u2014 the name of the new capital means \u201cRoyal City.\u201d Then, as now, there was a fierce line between the rulers and the ruled. \n For the first time, health workers said they were discovering severe malnutrition among children in urban centers, a true anomaly in a lush country that was once the world\u2019s biggest exporter of rice. \n In Mandalay, the second-biggest city, almost naked children with distended stomachs scrounged on the riverfront. In one village on the Thwande River on the west coast, nomadic families were too strapped for food to offer any to visitors, a traditional courtesy in Myanmar. \n \u201cWhy is there severe malnutrition in this Garden of Eden? Because people are poor,\u201d said Frank Smithuis, a physician who has worked in Myanmar since 1994 and heads the Doctors Without Borders, Holland, medical programs. \u201cPeople are going from three meals to two meals to one meal. One meal a day just isn\u2019t enough.\u201d\n In the village of Leat Pan Gyunt, south of Sittwe, villagers said they could afford to send their girls to school for only three years. The local school consisted of one dirt-floored room for all grades from first to eighth. The desks were planks of wood supported on two bricks. \n Afraid of protests by students, the government dispersed the University of Yangon to sites outside the capital. \n At the new Magway University, the medical students were learning surgery from books and videos, without working on human corpses because the government refused to pay for formaldehyde, two people familiar with the situation said. \n In contrast to the deepening poverty \u2014 Myanmar\u2019s per capita income is calculated at $175 a year, far below neighboring Bangladesh \u2014 the military leaders were amassing fortunes, people said. \n The latest evidence was a video leaked to a Web site, www.irrawaddy.org, based in Thailand, of the recent opulent wedding of General Than Shwe\u2019s daughter, Thandar Shwe. The video showed the bride, with her father alongside her, decked out in a necklace of six ropes of large diamonds, her hair looped with diamonds as well. \n For those educated people who want change, the path is treacherous.\n \u201cI don\u2019t want to waste myself in jail,\u201d said one woman, who had two relatives imprisoned. \u201cThey were not the same when they came out.\u201d \n In a similar vein to the dissidents in Eastern Europe in the 1980s, the woman said she believed change had to come from inside the country. But unlike Poland under Soviet rule, no unions are allowed in Myanmar, and most kinds of formal associations are considered suspect. \n She said she held classes at her home on how to be more confident, how to strategize. She was trying to spread her classes to Buddhist monasteries and Christian churches, she said. \n \u201cOnly education can change people because people don\u2019t know anything,\u201d she said. \u201cOnly about 10 percent of the people know what is going on.\u201d Sometimes she was in such despair, she said, that she believed that the only way to win against the government was \u201cto think like them.\u201d \n\u201cBut we can\u2019t think like them,\u201d she added, \u201cnobody thinks like them.\u201d \n Not all opposition groups that work outside the country believe that Washington\u2019s hard line is serving the best interests of Myanmar or the United States. \n With its policy of isolation, the Bush administration was allowing China, and to a lesser extent, India, to have a free hand in Myanmar to the exclusion of the United States, said Aung Naing Oo, who spent a year at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and who is the author of several books on Myanmar. \n \u201cThe geopolitical situation favors the Burmese military,\u201d he said. \u201cChina and India both want to support it, and the Asian nations have no teeth.\u201d \n Still, on a recent trip to Vietnam, a delegation of Myanmar officials heard something that astounded them, he said. They went to find out why Vietnam had become so suddenly prosperous. \n \u201cThe Vietnamese said one word: \u2018The Americans.\u2019 The Burmese could not believe that after fighting a war Vietnam was friendly with the United States.\u201d",

    "text": "In Glitter and Glory, the Rock of All Ages\n2006-11-18T05:00:00.000Z\n\u201cGold,\u201d a mostly riveting exhibition that opens today at the American Museum of Natural History, is the museum\u2019s latest show-and-tell about a precious natural material. Its predecessors have been devoted to amber, diamonds and pearls. Taken together, these exhibitions form a genre at which the museum excels. \nThe formula, executed here by James D. Webster, overseeing curator of the exhibition and chairman of the museum\u2019s division of earth and planetary sciences, and Charles S. Spencer, chairman of its division of anthropology, goes as follows:\n Using art, artifacts, natural samples, wall texts and mural-size photographs, weave together narratives about the material\u2019s formation, its effect on the course of history and its uses by artists and artisans. Lace with startling facts and fascinating vignettes (a link to Spanish sunken treasure, for example). Throw in a few comparative displays that verge on installation art. Lure visitors in one end and wait for them to emerge from the other with minds boggled and eyes dazzled. Greet them with a well-stocked museum shop. \nBut, really, nothing is as good as gold, and very little ranges so vigorously among function, symbol and frivolity. \n Today 78 percent of the gold mined annually is used for jewelry. It is also basic to such coveted inessentials as the Oscar, Emmy and Grammy statuettes and of course gold records (all included here, along with the Kentucky Derby trophy won by Venetian Way in 1960). \n Yet gold, an excellent conductor of electricity, is also used in computer technology, and it is arguably the world\u2019s best reflector of light. Not for imperial gleam did the two Apollo 11 astronauts who walked on the moon wear glass visors surfaced in gold. The gold coating kept the sun from burning their eyes. A helmet is here, along with a small gold replica of the lunar module. It is one of three commissioned from Cartier by the French newspaper Le Monde as gifts for the crew when they visited Paris. \nIn all, \u201cGold\u201d makes gold seem like the blood coursing through the world\u2019s veins \u2014 and that\u2019s not just because, as one cluster of charts demonstrates, its deposits form under volcanic, hydrothermal conditions involving water gushing through rock. \nIf despite the pirate stories and gold rush movies of your childhood, or more recently the HBO hit \u201cDeadwood,\u201d you remain innocent of gold\u2019s brute power to seduce and corrupt, this show has the cure. It presents gold in three states: raw, artistic and monetary. Raw and monetary provide most of the thrills and insights, as the displays suggest that human artisans have rarely been able to surpass the beauty of gold in its unadulterated natural form or in its straightforward, bankable form. \nBut if the art part of the exhibition seems relatively weak, consider the competition. To one side are several drop-dead vitrines in which crystallized gold erupts from quartz in fan-shaped flares or coiling plumes, like slightly rough-edged Art Nouveau bric-a-brac. To the other side are coins from an array of cultures and epochs, including a Wells Fargo strongbox apparently brimming with $20 double eagles. Also in the unadulterated category are the 27 United States Treasury gold ingots \u2014 each the size of an egg carton, each weighing around 27 pounds \u2014 protectively displayed in a vitrine with extra-thick Plexiglas. \nThe show\u2019s opening section may cause you to wonder about how the concepts of beauty, fetishism and value took shape in the mind of prehistoric man. Imagine that you are a hunter-gatherer living around 20,000 B.C. In a creek bed you discover a small nugget of gold, one of the few minerals that occur naturally in a nearly pure state. It glimmers, it glows, it doesn\u2019t tarnish; it is solid light, fire that doesn\u2019t burn. As the exhibition demonstrates, the shapes that gold takes in nature vary and lend themselves to interpretation. A sea horse. An imposing ring (Wagner, anyone?). The state of Texas. It must be magic. \nUnusually malleable and ductile, gold was probably the first metal humans worked with. For the record, one ounce can be pounded into enough gold leaf to cover the interior of a nine-foot cube, which is shown here, or drawn out into 50 miles of very thin wire, which is not. A series of small medallions illustrate the differences among yellow, pink, white, green and black gold \u2014 the results of what other metals are alloyed with gold, which is rarely used in its pure state .\nThe displays begin with a few simple but imposing chunks of the subject at hand: the large molten-looking nugget aptly named \u201cThe Boot of Cortez\u201d; the aggregate of shimmering granular crystals known as the Newmont Gold Mass; the clump of surprisingly regular cubes of the La Trobe Nugget. We learn that gold leaf and gold wire, in particular, can occur more or less naturally.\n The show segues into the history of mining, with a timeline of the world\u2019s gold rushes. Minerals are superseded by facts about minerals. You learn that 90 percent of the gold that has been mined has been brought out since 1848, when gold was discovered at Sutter\u2019s Mill in California, and that 40 percent of that total has come from South African mines \u2014 an industry memorably documented by the photographer Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado. \n\u201cGolden Ages,\u201d the section devoted to human creations in gold, is relatively small and consequently feels a bit perfunctory: a little Egyptian gold, a piece of Scythian gold, some African pieces (including a beautiful mask pendant from Ghana lent by the Brooklyn Museum), a Javanese dagger whose rippling blade is bisected by the rippling line of a snakelike dragon, a rattle from Tiffany & Company, some Japanese lacquer and a trove of radiant dowry jewelry from Bangladesh in 22-karat gold.\n The best and largest vitrine is devoted to pre-Columbian gold, one of the strengths of the museum\u2019s holdings. Here an embossed Cocl\u00e9 helmet looks a little like a brain, and a Cocl\u00e9 cast tumbaga pendant shows two finely worked hunters, carrying spears, clubs and trophy heads. One side of this four-sided vitrine displays little but a row of miniature tupu pins, used by Incan women to secure their clothing. The label points out that virtually all Incan gold, thought to be among \u201cthe greatest accumulation of gold in history,\u201d was melted down, much of it by the Incas when the Spanish ransomed their king, the rest by the Spanish, who took the ransom and killed the king. The boot of Cortez, indeed.\n Surveying the varieties of ingots in this exhibition\u2019s final gallery, you may wonder where all that Incan gold is today. ",

    "text": "Myanmar Is Left in Dark, an Energy-Rich Orphan\n2006-11-17T05:00:00.000Z\nCorrection Appended\nSITTWE, Myanmar - In the balmy waters of the Bay of Bengal, just off the coast, an Asian energy rush is on. Huge pockets of natural gas have been found. China and India are jostling to sign deals. Plans are afoot to spend billions on new ports and pipelines.\nYet onshore, in towns like this one, not a light is to be seen -- not a street lamp, not a glow in a window -- as women crouch by the roadside at dawn, sorting by candlelight the vegetables they will sell for two cents a bunch at the morning market.\nParaffin and wood are major sources of light and heat. People receive two hours of electricity a day from a military government that is among the world's most repressive.\nBut attempts at outside pressure to prod the government to address its people's needs and curb abuses have faltered, in large part because China's thirst for resources has undermined nearly a decade of American economic sanctions.\nCritics say that Washington's policy has handed Myanmar, formerly Burma, to China. Still, as President Bush prepares to meet with leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Vietnam on Nov. 17, one topic on his agenda will be how to keep up the pressure. He is not likely to find cooperation, not from rivals like China and Russia, nor even countries like Singapore and Indonesia, which trade freely with Myanmar.\nThe Asian energy rush is the latest demonstration of how the hunt for oil and gas, and China's economic leverage, are reshaping international politics, often in ways that run counter to American preferences.\nIn many respects, with the rise of China's economic power and its unflagging support, the government here has become more entrenched than ever, people inside and outside the country say.\n\"What can we do about it?\" said a well educated man here, when asked about the plans to sell the gas abroad in the face of the deprivation at home. \"What good would it do to protest, what would we get?\" People were too afraid of the 400,000-member strong army supplied by China, Russia and Ukraine to complain, he said.\nIn numerous encounters in Myanmar, where most speak with extreme caution to foreigners and almost always anonymously for fear of jail, people joked sardonically that China was the \"big daddy\" and that soon it would \"own\" Myanmar. \"China is a good friend of the government, not of the people,\" one woman said. \"They are like brother and brother-in-law.\"\nThe Bush administration has pledged that it will not let up on its sanctions against the government until it releases the opposition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been under house arrest for 11 of the past 17 years.\nMrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's political party won an overwhelming victory in elections in 1990, and Washington insists that the government recognize those results, and release an estimated 1,100 political prisoners.\nThe Bush administration says it plans to file a Security Council resolution at the United Nations in coming weeks condemning the government for its human rights abuses, and tightening sanctions further.\nThe United Nations under secretary general, Ibrahim Gambari, met with the junta leader, Gen. Than Shwe, on Nov. 11 in Myanmar and urged the government to mend its ways on forced labor and political prisoners. The meeting ended inconclusively, United Nations officials said.\nWith so much energy and other resources at stake, and given its preference to shun outside interference in internal politics, China's leaders are seemingly unbothered by what is happening inside Myanmar.\nChina's National Development Reform Commission approved plans in April to build a pipeline that would carry China's Middle East oil from a deep water port off Sittwe across Myanmar to Yunnan, China's southern province. This would provide China with an alternative to the Strait of Malacca, which it now depends on for delivering its oil from the Middle East.\nThough no date has been announced for work on the new pipeline across Myanmar, the military appeared to be getting ready to build the deep sea port on the island of Ramree, to the south of here, local people said.\nIn another sign of the importance of Myanmar to China, the chairman of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, Fu Chengyu, said in a speech this year that the company would focus its investment in the medium term on two countries: Myanmar and Nigeria. Engineers at the company, known as Cnooc, are currently exploring for oil on Ramree, and the company has rights to other oil deposits in central Myanmar, according to Myanmar government reports.\nIndia, thirsty for energy to fuel its own fast-growing economy, sees Myanmar as a place where it needs to contain China. In the late 1990s, democratic India switched its policy toward Myanmar from antagonism to friendship.\nAnd Thailand, Southeast Asia's largest economy, spends about $1.2 billion a year for Myanmar's natural gas, giving the military government badly needed hard currency.\nIn conversations with people in a number of towns, a portrait emerged of a universally unpopular, deeply corrupt government. People told of worsening poverty, a collapsed education system and a health care system that could deal only with those who paid. Tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS were rampant, they said.\nThe government's budget for its AIDS program in 2004 was $22,000, according to a recent health survey by John Hopkins University Medical School.\nThe junta leader, Gen. Than Shwe, 73, whose early military training was in psychological warfare, was described by many here as a master manipulator of his minions. He insisted, apparently out of fear of a coup, that the capital be moved this year from Yangon, formerly Rangoon, to a new site in the jungle, Naypyidaw.\nThe move, costing millions of scarce dollars, was in step with the general's belief that he marched in the footsteps of the old Burmese kings -- the name of the new capital means \"Royal City.\" Then, as now, there was a fierce line between the rulers and the ruled.\nFor the first time, health workers said they were discovering severe malnutrition among children in urban centers, a true anomaly in a lush country that was once the world's biggest exporter of rice.\nIn Mandalay, the second-biggest city, almost naked children with distended stomachs scrounged on the riverfront. In one village on the Thwande River on the west coast, nomadic families were too strapped for food to offer any to visitors, a traditional courtesy in Myanmar.\n\"Why is there severe malnutrition in this Garden of Eden? Because people are poor,\" said Frank Smithuis, a physician who has worked in Myanmar since 1994 and heads the Doctors Without Borders, Holland, medical programs. \"People are going from three meals to two meals to one meal. One meal a day just isn't enough.\"\nIn the village of Leat Pan Gyunt, south of Sittwe, villagers said they could afford to send their girls to school for only three years. The local school consisted of one dirt-floored room for all grades from first to eighth. The desks were planks of wood supported on two bricks.\nAfraid of protests by students, the government dispersed the University of Yangon to sites outside the capital.\nAt the new Magway University, the medical students were learning surgery from books and videos, without working on human corpses because the government refused to pay for formaldehyde, two people familiar with the situation said.\nIn contrast to the deepening poverty -- Myanmar's per capita income is calculated at $175 a year, far below neighboring Bangladesh -- the military leaders were amassing fortunes, people said.\nThe latest evidence was a video leaked to a Web site, www.irrawaddy.org, based in Thailand, of the recent opulent wedding of General Than Shwe's daughter, Thandar Shwe. The video showed the bride, with her father alongside her, decked out in a necklace of six ropes of large diamonds, her hair looped with diamonds as well.\nFor those educated people who want change, the path is treacherous.\n\"I don't want to waste myself in jail,\" said one woman, who had two relatives imprisoned. \"They were not the same when they came out.\"\nIn a similar vein to the dissidents in Eastern Europe in the 1980s, the woman said she believed change had to come from inside the country. But unlike Poland under Soviet rule, no unions are allowed in Myanmar, and most kinds of formal associations are considered suspect.\nShe said she held classes at her home on how to be more confident, how to strategize. She was trying to spread her classes to Buddhist monasteries and Christian churches, she said.\n\"Only education can change people because people don't know anything,\" she said. \"Only about 10 percent of the people know what is going on.\" Sometimes she was in such despair, she said, that she believed that the only way to win against the government was \"to think like them.\"\n\"But we can't think like them,\" she added, \"nobody thinks like them.\"\nNot all opposition groups that work outside the country believe that Washington's hard line is serving the best interests of Myanmar or the United States.\nWith its policy of isolation, the Bush administration was allowing China, and to a lesser extent, India, to have a free hand in Myanmar to the exclusion of the United States, said Aung Naing Oo, who spent a year at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and who is the author of several books on Myanmar.\n\"The geopolitical situation favors the Burmese military,\" he said. \"China and India both want to support it, and the Asian nations have no teeth.\"\nStill, on a recent trip to Vietnam, a delegation of Myanmar officials heard something that astounded them, he said. They went to find out why Vietnam had become so suddenly prosperous.\n\"The Vietnamese said one word: 'The Americans.' The Burmese could not believe that after fighting a war Vietnam was friendly with the United States.\"\nCorrection: November 21, 2006, Tuesday Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about the impact of the Asian energy rush on international policies and on Myanmar named the wrong country as having Southeast Asia's largest economy. Most major economic measurements indicate that it is Indonesia, not Thailand.",

    "text": "Racing to Know the Rarest of Rhinos, Before It\u0092s Too Late\n2006-07-11T05:00:00.000Z\nA two-ton rhinoceros measuring 5 feet tall and 10 feet long, with a fondness for browsing on low-lying shrubbery, hardly seems like a difficult animal to find. Unless there are fewer than 60 left on the planet.\nThat is the case with the Javan rhinoceros, often called the rarest large mammal on earth and perhaps the most endangered. Like its near -- and larger -- cousin the Indian rhinoceros, the Javan has only one horn, compared with two for Africa's black and white rhinos and the Sumatran of Asia. The Javan, like the Indian, also has large plates of folded skin that resemble armor but do not protect against guns.\nBecause they lead solitary, secretive lives in remote forests in Indonesia and Vietnam, these rhinos are very hard to study: images of them come from \"camera traps\" activated by movement in the forest, and biologists get DNA samples from dung or from the horns and hides of dead animals.\n\"It is totally amazing how little we know about these animals, their mating habits and social behavior,\" said Dr. Prithiviraj Fernando, director of the Center for Conservation and Research in Rajagiriya, Sri Lanka. \"Till a decade ago people were debating whether the females have horns.\" (They do.) Dr. Fernando was the lead author of a paper in the journal Conservation Genetics last month on the first detailed genetic study of the Javan rhino.\nNone of the rhinos exist in zoos. Without considerable luck and daring political leadership, the last Javan rhino will vanish from the Asian mainland in the next few years, leaving only those on the island of Java, whose forebears became isolated by rising sea levels 500,000 to a million years ago.\nEven its island redoubt is no guarantee against extinction, say Dr. Fernando and his co-authors, an international team of scientists and conservationists. They estimated that populations might be too small to sustain: 40 to 50 animals in Ujung Kulon, an Indonesian national park on the western end of Java, and just 3 to 8 in Cat Tien National Park in southern Vietnam, half the number a decade ago.\nThe plight of the Javan rhino is a direct result of human actions, especially habitat destruction and hunting, Dr. Fernando said. For millions of years, the animal flourished in lowland forests from eastern India and Bangladesh all the way to the islands of Java and Sumatra, now part of Indonesia. During periods of glacial advance and low sea levels, those islands formed a land mass, Sundaland, that was connected to the mainland.\nUnfortunately for the rhino, humans favored the same habitat and had little use for a large herbivore that raided their crops. Farmers regarded rhinos as agricultural pests and often killed them on sight. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the advent of colonialism and firearms drew hunters who slaughtered thousands. By 1934, the species was all but extinct on the Asian mainland.\nDevastated by the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883, the Ujung Kulon peninsula was later recolonized by rhinos and other animals but not by humans. It has since become a national park, and strong anti-poaching measures are in place. But perversely, the rhinos' numbers have barely budged since 1980; the lack of human disturbance means that mature forests and exotic plants are replacing the shrubby lowland vegetation the animal prefers.\nA further problem, the scientists say, is that the remaining rhino populations lack the genetic variation they need to combat disease, adapt to changing conditions and avoid the health and fertility problems that arise from inbreeding. The situation is especially desperate in Vietnam. But Dr. Fernando said in an e-mail message, \"There is still detectable genetic diversity within the Ujung Kulon animals, which tells us we can still save this population.\"\nThe task of saving the rhino is even more complicated because the Java and Vietnam populations represent different subspecies and should be managed separately to preserve any unique adaptations and mutations, said Don J. Melnick, a biologist at Columbia University and the project leader of the first Javan rhino genetic study through the university's Center for Environmental Research and Conservation. But Dr. Melnick added that it might be too late to preserve a distinct subspecies in Vietnam.\n\"Unless more individuals are brought into the Vietnam population,\" he said, \"it is hard to see how it survives.\"\nGert Polet, a co-author of the Conservation Genetics paper and an adviser to the World Wide Fund for Nature's program to protect Asian rhinos and elephants, says all may not be lost in Vietnam. Security there has improved, Mr. Polet said, and government officials and local residents are more sensitive to the rhinos' needs.\n\"It is not unthinkable that there is a male and breeding is taking place,\" he wrote in an e-mail message. Moreover, he added, the rhinos used to venture out only under cover of darkness; \"recently daytime pictures have been taken (the first ever as far as we know), indicating that the rhinos feel more at ease than before.\"\nThe Ujung Kulon rhinos face different problems, the scientists say, mainly habitat decline. But increasing the population is still their foremost aim. \"We have got to get to 100 animals in the Ujung Kulon population, as a short-term goal, to stabilize the erosion of genetic variation,\" Dr. Melnick said.\nThe Indonesian forestry department has decided to improve rhino habitat in Ujung Kulon by keeping out or removing competitor species, like the banteng, a wild cow, and invasive, exotic plants that crowd out the rhino's preferred food, Adhi Rachmat Hariyadi, site manager for the World Wide Fund for Nature's Ujung Kulon National Park project, wrote in an e-mail message.\nThe department is also proceeding with plans to establish a second rhino population in a site to be determined, he said. No program is planned to breed rhinos in captivity, but new genetic analyses by Dr. Melnick's team, now under way, will be used to identify good candidates for relocation.\nDr. Fernando, Dr. Melnick and their co-authors also discuss more active proposals to encourage reproduction, including establishing managed breeding centers in natural settings, a plan endorsed in 1997 by a specialist group of IUCN, also known as the World Conservation Union.\nNico J. van Strien, a coordinator for the International Rhino Foundation and a co-author of the IUCN report, said the Javan rhino recovery effort had been set back by the failure of a costly captive breeding program for the imperiled Sumatran rhino, in the 1980's and 90's.\nOccupying much the same range as the Javan rhino but preferring uplands to lowlands, the Sumatran rhino has two horns and hair and is slightly smaller. Although more numerous than the Javan, the Sumatran rhino is often considered more endangered, Dr. van Strien said, because its remaining habit is less secure from poachers and encroaching humans.\nIt is, he said, a fine and dubious distinction, since the goal is to save them both.\n\"Part of our purpose in writing this article was to call attention to the plight of the rhino,\" Dr. Fernando said. He and his colleagues hope conservation groups worldwide will help the local authorities deal with the conflicts and economic dislocation that will inevitably arise as efforts are made to expand rhino habitat in some of the most densely peopled parts of the world.\nTo his mind, those groups have no choice.\n\"Allowing a species such as a rhinoceros to go extinct in the 21st century,\" he writes, \"would be tragic and unpardonable.\"",

    "text": "Power and politics in Myanmar - Asia - Pacific - International Herald Tribune\n2006-11-16T05:00:00.000Z\nSITTWE, Myanmar \u2014 In the balmy waters of the Bay of Bengal, just off the coast, an Asian energy rush is on. Huge pockets of natural gas have been found. China and India are jostling to sign deals. Plans are afoot to spend billions on new ports and pipelines.\nYet onshore, in towns like this one, not a light is to be seen - not a street lamp, not a glow in a window - as women crouch on the roadside at dawn, sorting by candlelight the vegetables they will sell for two cents a bunch at the morning market. Paraffin and wood are major sources of light and heat. People receive two hours of electricity a day from a military government that is among the world's most closed and repressive.\nThe Burmese energy boom is the latest demonstration of how the hunt for oil and gas, and China's economic leverage in particular, is reshaping international politics, often in ways that run counter to goals of the United States.\nFor example, as President George W. Bush heads to Hanoi for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting this weekend, one topic on his agenda will be how to keep up pressure for democratic change in Myanmar. The United States has tried for nearly a decade to do so with economic sanctions.\nDespite the name of the forum, Bush is not likely to find cooperation over Myanmar - not from rivals like China, which values Myanmar for its strategic location on the Indian Ocean and its array of natural resources, or from allies like Singapore and Indonesia that trade freely with Myanmar.\nWith the backing of China, its main friend and economic benefactor, the military junta that rules Myanmar has long remained confident that it could stave off the calls for change. That confidence has grown in tandem with China's economic power. In many respects the government here has become more entrenched than ever, people inside and outside the country say.\nIn numerous encounters in Myanmar, where most speak with extreme caution to foreigners and almost always anonymously for fear of jail, people joked sardonically that China was the Big Daddy or that soon China would \"own\" Myanmar.\n\"What can we do about it?\" a well- educated man here said when asked about the plans to sell the gas abroad in the face of the deprivation at home. \"What good would it do to protest, what would we get?\" Because of the country's 400,000-strong army, which is supplied by China, Russia and Ukraine, people are too afraid to complain, he said.\nOne woman called China a good friend of the Burmese government, not its people. \"They are like brother and brother-in-law,\" she said of the two governments.\nThe Bush administration has pledged that it will not let up on its sanctions against Myanmar until its government releases Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader who has been under house arrest for 11 of the past 17 years.\nAung San Suu Kyi's political party won an overwhelming victory in elections in 1990. Washington demands that the government here recognize those results and release an estimated 1,100 political prisoners.\nThe Bush administration says it plans to propose a resolution at the United Nations Security Council in the coming weeks condemning Myanmar for human rights abuses and tightening sanctions even further.\nOn Nov. 11, Under Secretary General Ibrahim Gambari of the United Nations met in Myanmar with General Than Shwe, the junta leader, and urged the government to mend its ways on forced labor and political prisoners. The meeting ended inconclusively, United Nations officials said.\nWith so many resources at stake and given China's preference to shun interference in other countries' internal affairs, China's leaders are seemingly less bothered by what is happening inside Myanmar.\nChina's National Development Reform Commission approved plans in April to build a pipeline that would carry China's Middle East oil from a deep-water port off Sittwe across Myanmar to Yunnan, a southern Chinese province. This would give China an alternative route from the Malacca Straits, on which it now depends for delivering its oil from the Middle East.\nThough no date has been announced for work on the pipeline across Myanmar, the Burmese military appears to be getting ready to build the port on Ramree, an island south of Sittwe, local people said.\nIn another sign of the importance of Myanmar to China, Fu Chengyu, chairman of Cnooc, the Hong Kong subsidiary of China National Offshore Oil Corp., said in a speech this year that the company would focus its investment in the medium term on two countries: Myanmar and Nigeria.\nIndeed, Cnooc engineers are currently exploring for oil on Ramree Island, and the company has rights to other oil deposits in central Myanmar, according to Burmese government reports.\nIndia, thirsty for energy to fuel its own fast-growing economy, sees Myanmar as a place where it needs to contain China. In the late 1990s, democratic India, which will not be represented at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Hanoi, switched its policy toward Myanmar from antagonism to friendship.\nThailand, which has Southeast Asia's largest economy, spends about $1.2 billion a year for Myanmar's natural gas, providing badly needed hard currency.\nIn conversations with people in a number of Burmese towns, a portrait emerged of a universally unpopular, deeply corrupt regime. People told of worsening poverty, a collapsed education system and a health care system that could deal only with those who paid. Tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS were rampant, they said.\nThe junta leader, Than Shwe, 73, whose early military training was in psychological warfare, was described as a master manipulator of his minions. He had insisted, apparently out of fear of a coup, that the capital be moved this year from Yangon, formerly Rangoon, to a new site in the jungle, Naypyidaw.\nThe move, costing countless millions of scarce dollars, was in step with the general's belief that he marched in the footsteps of the old Burmese kings and their Buddhist faith, people in Yangon said. Then, as now, there was a brutal divide between the rulers and the ruled. The name of the new capital means Royal City.\nFor the first time, health workers said they were discovering severe malnutrition among children in urban centers, a true anomaly in a lush Garden of Eden that was once the world's biggest exporter of rice.\nIn Mandalay, the second-biggest city, almost naked children scrounged around on the riverfront with distended stomachs. In one village on the west coast along the Thwande River, nomadic families were too strapped to offer the traditional courtesy of food to visitors.\nFrank Smithius, a physician, has worked in Myanmar since 1994 and heads medical programs for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res Holland. \"Why is there severe malnutrition in this Garden of Eden?\" he asked. \"Because people are poor. You don't see the malnutrition. Why? Because the children don't walk around. Why don't they walk? Because they are too weak.\"\nIn Leat Pan Gyunt, a village south of Sittwe, villagers said they could afford only to send their girls to school for three years. The local school consists of one room with a dirt floor for all children from the first to eighth grades. The desks were planks of wood supported on two bricks. A 10-year-old girl in a torn yellow dress had left the school two years ago, her parents said, and was now doing household chores to help the family.\nAfraid of protests by students, the government dispersed the University of Yangon to other cities. At the new Magway University, the medical students were learning surgery from books and videos, without working on human corpses because the government refused to pay for formaldehyde, two people familiar with the situation said.\nEven those with close ties to the government, like a businessman who played golf with the local commander, described the leaders in less than flattering terms. \"They are very slow, very secretive,\" he said.\nIn contrast to the deepening poverty - Myanmar's per capita income is calculated at $175 a year, far below neighboring Bangladesh - the military leaders were amassing fortunes, people said.\nThe latest evidence was a video of the recent opulent wedding of Than Shwe's daughter, Thandar Shwe. The video, which was leaked to a Web site based in Thailand, Irrawaddy.org, showed the bride, with her father alongside, decked out in a necklace of six ropes of large diamonds, her hair looped with diamonds.\nFor those educated people who want change, the path is treacherous.\n\"I don't want to waste myself in jail,\" said one woman who has two relatives who were imprisoned. \"They were not the same when they came out.\"\nLike the dissidents in Eastern Europe in the 1980s, the woman said she believed change had to come from inside the country. But unlike Poland under Soviet rule, no unions are allowed in Myanmar and most kinds of formal associations are considered suspect.\nShe said she held classes at her home on how to be more confident, how to strategize. She was trying to spread her classes to Buddhist monasteries and Christian churches, she said.\n\"Only education can change people because people don't know anything,\" she said. \"Only about 10 percent of the people know what is going on.\" Sometimes she was in such despair, she said, that she believed that the only way to win against the government was \"to think like them.\"\n\"But we can't think like them,\" she quickly added. \"Nobody thinks like them.\"\nNot all opposition groups that work outside the country believe that Washington's hard line is serving the best interests of Myanmar or the United States.\nBy isolating Myanmar, the Bush administration is allowing China, and to a lesser extent India, to have a free hand to the exclusion of the United States, said Aung Naing Oo, who spent a year at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and is the author of several books on Myanmar.\n\"The geopolitical situation favors the Burmese military,\" he said. \"China and India both want to support it, and the Asian nations have no teeth.\"\nStill, on a recent trip to Vietnam, a delegation of Myanmar officials heard something that astounded them, Aung Naing Oo said. They went to find out why Vietnam had so suddenly become prosperous.\n\"The Americans\" was the answer, he said. \"The Burmese could not believe that after fighting a war, Vietnam was friendly with the United States.\"",

But Dr. Melnick added that it might be too late to preserve a distinct subspecies in Vietnam. \n\u201cUnless more individuals are brought into the Vietnam population,\u201d he said, \u201cit is hard to see how it survives.\u201d \nGert Polet, a co-author of the Conservation Genetics paper and an adviser to the World Wide Fund for Nature\u2019s program to protect Asian rhinos and elephants, says all may not be lost in Vietnam. Security there has improved, Mr. Polet said, and government officials and local residents are more sensitive to the rhinos\u2019 needs. \n\u201cIt is not unthinkable that there is a male and breeding is taking place,\u201d he wrote in an e-mail message. Moreover, he added, the rhinos used to venture out only under cover of darkness; \u201crecently daytime pictures have been taken (the first ever as far as we know), indicating that the rhinos feel more at ease than before.\u201d \nThe Ujung Kulon rhinos face different problems, the scientists say, mainly habitat decline. But increasing the population is still their foremost aim. \u201cWe have got to get to 100 animals in the Ujung Kulon population, as a short-term goal, to stabilize the erosion of genetic variation,\u201d Dr. Melnick said. \nThe Indonesian forestry department has decided to improve rhino habitat in Ujung Kulon by keeping out or removing competitor species, like the banteng, a wild cow, and invasive, exotic plants that crowd out the rhino\u2019s preferred food, Adhi Rachmat Hariyadi, site manager for the World Wide Fund for Nature\u2019s Ujung Kulon National Park project, wrote in an e-mail message. \nThe department is also proceeding with plans to establish a second rhino population in a site to be determined, he said. No program is planned to breed rhinos in captivity, but new genetic analyses by Dr. Melnick\u2019s team, now under way, will be used to identify good candidates for relocation.\nDr. Fernando, Dr. Melnick and their co-authors also discuss more active proposals to encourage reproduction, including establishing managed breeding centers in natural settings, a plan endorsed in 1997 by a specialist group of IUCN, also known as the World Conservation Union.\nNico J. van Strien, a coordinator for the International Rhino Foundation and a co-author of the IUCN report, said the Javan rhino recovery effort had been set back by the failure of a costly captive breeding program for the imperiled Sumatran rhino, in the 1980\u2019s and 90\u2019s.\nOccupying much the same range as the Javan rhino but preferring uplands to lowlands, the Sumatran rhino has two horns and hair and is slightly smaller. Although more numerous than the Javan, the Sumatran rhino is often considered more endangered, Dr. van Strien said, because its remaining habit is less secure from poachers and encroaching humans.\nIt is, he said, a fine and dubious distinction, since the goal is to save them both. \n\u201cPart of our purpose in writing this article was to call attention to the plight of the rhino,\u201d Dr. Fernando said. He and his colleagues hope conservation groups worldwide will help the local authorities deal with the conflicts and economic dislocation that will inevitably arise as efforts are made to expand rhino habitat in some of the most densely peopled parts of the world. \nTo his mind, those groups have no choice. \n\u201cAllowing a species such as a rhinoceros to go extinct in the 21st century,\u201d he writes, \u201cwould be tragic and unpardonable.\u201d ",

    "text": "A maid becomes a literary star in India - Asia - Pacific - International Herald Tribune\n2006-07-13T05:00:00.000Z\nNEW DELHI \u2014 Abandoned by her mother at 4, married off at 12 to an abusive husband, a mother herself at 13 - there is little in Baby Halder's traumatic childhood to suggest she would become an emerging star on India's literary horizon.\nA single mother at 25, struggling to feed her three children by working as a maid for a series of exploitative employers, Halder had no time to devote to reading or to contemplating the harsh reality of her existence - until she started work in the home of a sympathetic retired academic, who caught her browsing through his books when she was meant to be dusting the shelves. He discovered a latent interest in literature, gave her a child's notebook and pen and encouraged her to start writing.\nA \"Life Less Ordinary,\" this season's publishing sensation in New Delhi, is the result of her nighttime writing sessions, squeezed in after her housework duties were finished, when she poured raw memories of her early life into the lined exercise books.\nPrabodh Kumar, the retired anthropology professor who discovered her, was impressed with what he had read, and encouraged her to continue.\nAfter several months, he sat down with her and helped edit her text into book form. Translated into English earlier this year, Halder's autobiography has become a bestseller.\nIn content, this is an Indian \"Angela's Ashes\" - echoing Frank McCourt's Pulitzer prize-winning account of his miserable boyhood in Ireland with a story of a bleak upbringing in 1970s northeastern India.\nHalder's style will never win her literary prizes; even with Kumar's editing, the narrative is rough and the profusion of characters who flit in and out is bemusing; but despite this, the book provides a profoundly moving picture of how life is for millions of impoverished Indian women.\nHer book gives a voice to a group of people who, for reasons of tradition and education, are usually condemned to remain silent. It provides a fascinating insight into an unfamiliar side of Indian life, not usually the focus of novelists' attention.\nHalder's life story is written baldly, without a trace of self-pity. She starts out with a snapshot of how her mother - exhausted by her father's extended absences and his failure to provide for the family - goes out to the market and never returns.\nWith stark absence of sentimentality, she relates how her father beat her for telling a school friend that there was no food in the house, how one stepmother appears and then another, how intermittent spells of schooling are cut short by money shortages and domestic chaos, and how her elder sister is married off abruptly because her father can no longer keep her.\nShe was too young to understand the significance of the preparations for her own marriage, preferring to play with her friends in the street instead. After meeting her future husband, twice her age, the 12-year-old Baby tells a friend: \"It will be a good thing to be married. At least I will get to have a feast.\"\nEven in the hours before her wedding, \"I'd sing and jump about and play,\" she writes.\nA realization of the horror of her new married life comes suddenly. Soon she is pregnant, and barely understanding what has happened, finds herself being rebuked by the doctor for \"choosing\" at so young an age to have a child.\nTwo more children follow, then her husband splits her head open with a rock, and her elder sister is murdered by her own violent husband.\nHalder decides to walk out on her marriage. She flees on a train to Delhi, where, like many other desperate women, she seeks work as a cleaner in the homes of the capital's newly rich middle class.\nThere she escapes destitution by sending her eldest son out to become an illegal child domestic servant and by working herself for foul, selfish employers. Her bosses treat her without humanity, forcing her to lock her children in the attic all day while she works.\nShe writes of one employer: \"As soon as she sat down I'd offer her tea, water, sherbet, whatever she wanted. Then I had to massage her head or her feet or whatever: the work was never ending.\"\nShe never articulates her rage directly and rarely blames her father or husband for the cruelty meted out toward her, but the facts stand for themselves and make for a powerful account of suffering. This is a simple description of a grim existence which has no need of embellishment with literary tricks.\nIn an interview at Kumar's house, where she still works as a housekeeper, she seems initially more at ease with her role as maid than as writer, refusing to sit down until everyone is given water and offered tea.\nHalder, now 32, says she wrote once her tasks were finished and the children were asleep, up in the servants' quarters in the house in Gurgaon, a city just outside Delhi.\n\"When I wrote I felt like I was talking to someone and after writing I would feel lighter, as if I had taken some sort of revenge against my father, who never took care of me as a father should, and against my husband,\" she says. \"I never thought that other people might be interested in reading my story.\"\nKumar, however, was immediately struck by what she had written.\n\"I was amazed; I knew it was very special,\" he says. He photocopied it and sent it to friends in the publishing world.\n\"They liked it and said it reminded them of Anne Frank's writing - she was a girl who wrote a diary and died young,\" Halder adds. \"I was encouraged to write down everything, my whole life. I had no plan to start a book, I was just writing.\"\nHailed by Delhi's literary elite as a groundbreaking work, \"A Life Less Ordinary\" has been translated into several Indian languages and has found readers among women who have shared Halder's difficulties.\n\"This is not a book that can be read and tossed aside. It raises questions about the fate of the millions of domestic workers in our country and their ill treatment,\" a review in The Hindu newspaper concludes. \"Truly this is a story of courage under fire.\"\nThis is also a portrait of the way modern Indian society treats women who leave their husbands - stigmatizing them and pushing them to the margins of existence.\n\"It is the most difficult thing for a woman to do,\" Halder says. \"People in the villages say dirty things about you, but I wanted to give my children a better life, so I had no choice.\"\n\"One woman told me that this was precisely her story too, which made me very happy,\" she added. \"There are so many other women in India who have left home like me. There is no support for them - life is not easy, and they are not able to speak out. If I can give them some confidence then I will be satisfied.\"\nKumar explains how he helped his maid reorder the text so it became a chronological account of her life, removing a lot of repetition and fixing grammatical mistakes. He says that, initially, her spelling and handwriting were abysmal, but these mistakes swiftly improved and gradually she gained greater sophistication as a writer.\nHer later manuscripts show tidy handwritten Bengali, crushed into the lined pages of the notepad as if she were concerned not to waste the paper.\nDespite being embraced by Delhi's literary circles (a recent launch for the Bengali edition was hosted by the Bangladeshi writer, Taslima Nasreen), Halder has no plans to change her career as a cleaner. She is writing her second book in between domestic chores.\n\"I want to be a writer and I will continue to write, but for now I cannot leave Tatush, so I will go on working here,\" she says, disappearing to prepare lunch for her boss - Tatush, as she calls him.",

    "text": "Man-made miracle: Honest rural health care\n2006-01-08T05:00:00.000Z\nREAP, Cambodia \u2014 Sovan Sna had been in labor all night long. By the 16th hour of contractions, she was in trouble. The baby, her first, was not coming out. And she was so exhausted and in such pain she could barely speak.\nHer mind churned with fear. In the Khmer language, this most treacherous passage in a woman's life - childbirth - is called crossing the river. Her aunt had died giving birth to a first child, who perished in the womb. Sna wondered if she and her baby, too, would drown before reaching the other shore.\nNot long ago, Sna would have had little choice but to give birth at home, like her aunt, and risk both her life and her baby's. But on this morning, Sna's terrified husband hired a pony cart and was able to take his wife over a deeply rutted dirt road to a small, no-frills public hospital.\nIf childbirth is a miracle of nature, then the thriving, honestly run network of clinics and hospitals here is a human marvel, managed not by the government but by one of the nonprofit groups it has hired to run entire public health districts.\nThe approach is catching on in a growing number of poor countries around the world, in Bangladesh and Afghanistan, in Congo and Rwanda, in Bolivia and Guatemala, reaching tens of millions of people.\nThese contracted services have allowed international donors and concerned governments to cut through dysfunctional bureaucracies, or work around them, and to improve health care and efficiency at modest cost.\nHere in Cambodia, the nonprofit groups, all of them international, are instilling discipline and clarity of purpose in a health care system enfeebled by corruption, absenteeism and decades of war and upheaval. They have introduced incentives to draw Cambodia's own doctors and nurses back into the system. Patients, especially the poorest ones, have followed in droves.\n\"All the evidence is that this worked very well in a situation where nothing much else worked very well,\" said Shyam Bajpai, the representative here for the Asian Development Bank, which financed the original contracts.\nCambodia's health care system is still recovering from the traumas of the murderous reign of the Khmer Rouge, which in the 1970s singled out the educated for slaughter, decimating the ranks of medical professionals. Decades of war that drew to a close only in 1998 destroyed hospitals and deepened poverty.\nToday international donors provide about two-thirds of the public spending on health and over the years have financed the construction of hundreds of hospitals and clinics. But money and buildings alone were not enough to overcome a bureaucratic culture afflicted by favoritism and lackadaisical accountability.\nThe Health Ministry began testing the use of contractors in 1999. Then, the main hospital in the Pearaing district was a crumbling shell. It had fallen so far into disuse that termite mounds rose on the broken tile floors and farm animals rooted in the yard, chewing on mangy bits of grass.\n\"We saw more cows than patients,\" said Sopha Sum, a nurse then assigned to the hospital.\nSix years after turning it over to Health Net International, based in the Netherlands, Pearaing's hospitals and clinics now see thousands of patients a week. In just the first nine months of 2005, more than half the district's 200,000 people sought care.\nAnd the government and donors are spending only $4 a year per person on health care in the district.\nThe five nongovernmental organizations running parts of the health system - Health Net and Save the Children Australia, among them - are paid based on their performance in improving services, like childhood immunizations and the proportion of women getting prenatal care and delivering babies in a health center. With additional support from Britain and the World Bank, the government recently expanded the approach to cover 1 in 10 Cambodians.\nDistricts managed by the nongovernmental organizations have been much more successful in improving health services than districts run by the government, a World Bank study found, though both have made progress. The study randomly assigned districts to be managed by nonprofits, or by the government, then measured results through household surveys conducted in 1997 and 2003.\n\"There were fantastic improvements,\" said Michael Kremer, a Harvard economist.\nThose changes did not happen overnight. For years, Dr. Fred Griffiths, the 54-year old Pakistani who runs the Pearaing district for Health Net, said most of his operating budget from the Cambodian government was siphoned away as it made its way through layers of bureaucracy.\nSao Chhorn, who then monitored the contracted districts for the Health Ministry, said officials simply took the money through various corrupt practices.\n\"At least 40 percent of the budget just disappears,\" said Chhorn, who now works for a management consulting firm. \"And this is the best situation. In the worst situation, almost all of it disappears.\"\nGriffiths said he found himself in the worst of situations. \"We screamed at workshops and conferences, wherever there was a forum,\" he said.\nLast year, to his relief, the government began transferring the funds directly from the national treasury to the contractors, bypassing potential layers of graft.\nBut he said his toughest job was motivating the staff. Griffiths realized he would never get the system functioning unless he could improve the health workers' earnings.\nThe government paid poverty wages: $20 a month to a doctor, $15 for a nurse. The staff pocketed the paltry government salaries and spent almost all their time operating private practices.\nA hospital in Snay Pol, a three-hour ride from the capital, Phnom Penh, was like a stolen car stripped of its parts. Griffiths said the equipment had simply disappeared, probably into the staff members' private practices.\nThermometers, stethoscopes, speculums, obstetrical instruments - all were missing.\nGriffiths decided to use part of his contracting budget to supplement his staff's pay. Pearaing also introduced small fees, charging 25 cents to see a doctor and 75 cents for a day's stay at the hospital.\nHealth Net used the revenue to bolster the staff's incomes, paying incentives for punctuality and reaching targets to immunize children, and generally instilling a culture of accountability. Despite grumbling, most of the staff gave up their side jobs to work full-time and provide 24-hour coverage. Nurses now earn $60 to $200 a month depending on their qualifications and performance, while doctors make $200 to $250.\nBecause the district's fees are much lower than those charged by the drug sellers, quacks and government doctors who used to operate private practices, peasants have flocked to the public clinics and hospitals. Health Net covers the hospital costs of the poor, about 40 percent of the patients, out of its contracting budget.\nThe hospital under Health Net's management has gradually won people's trust. Not least, the district's newfound credibility, as well as the 24-hour availability of qualified midwives and doctors, has transformed childbirth habits across this rural landscape.\nAs far back as anyone can remember, the women here in the village of Reap have depended only on traditional birth attendants - village women with no formal medical training - to bring babies into the world. But now more than half the women in the district give birth in a health center, compared with less than 10 percent in Cambodia.\n\"All our parents delivered at home,\" said Sna's husband, Veasna Van. \"Now, nobody does. We believe the health care center can save lives if there is a problem.\"\nSna's birth attendant, Min Heng, 50, agreed. \"I have only my empty hands,\" she explained.\nWith Heng assisting at the clinic, the midwife began to worry that Sna's labor had reached a standstill and decided she should be taken to the hospital in Snay Pol, where surgeons and better equipment were available.\nVan gently picked up his wife and placed her in a cart. Her face crumpled when yet another contraction seized her belly.\nAs the cart jounced through the emerald green paddy fields along a road cratered by the monsoons, Sna moaned, her husband rubbed her lower back and Heng rested her hand on Sna's hip.\nA half-hour later, they trotted up to the maternity ward at the hospital. Sorny Kong hustled into the birthing room. She started Sna on a sugar drip to give her a bit of a lift, got out the vacuum extractor - operated with a foot pedal - and attached the suction cup to the crown of the baby's head.\nA half hour later, a healthy boy emerged into the world.",

    "text": "Lights Out\n2006-11-19T05:00:00.000Z\nONE evening late last month, Gary Dennis was striding around Movie Place, his video store on 105th Street near Broadway, with a cordless phone clamped to his ear. His graying hair was brushed back, and he spoke, as usual, out of the side of his mouth. \"No, I'm not going to be in this industry anymore,\" he told the caller. \"The industry's dying.\" He waited a beat, then added, \"I'm going to sell drugs to junior high schoolers.\"\nMovie Place, which occupies a pale yellow room in a second-floor storefront, has 24,000 titles, making it one of New York's best-stocked video stores; the average Blockbuster carries only about 5,000 films. Movie Place's holdings -- sealed in binders, arranged in wooden crates, shelved high on every wall -- include commercial hits but also the very obscure, from a 1984 self-help video starring Mr. T to a biopic of Karen Carpenter acted out with Barbie dolls.\nPresiding over this treasure house is Mr. Dennis, a fierce-browed, loose-jointed 45-year-old who fills the air with a giddy mix of film trivia, sharp asides and ribbing. \"He didn't like 'Arrested Development'!\" he shouted, pointing at a customer in mock outrage. \"Should we throw him out?\"\nCustomers go to Movie Place to be part of this banter, but they will not be doing so for much longer. Faced with a large rent increase, Mr. Dennis plans to close his 22-year-old shop on Nov. 30.\nSuch closings are increasingly common in New York and around the country. Like the movie theaters that preceded them, video stores are fast becoming relics, and their signs may soon join those unlighted movie marquees (with a vestigial letter or two) that dot various neighborhoods and remind passers-by of what once was.\nBut the decline of the video store is more than a story of small merchants undone by technological change. Like movie theaters, and unlike delis or drugstores, video shops in a city as film-saturated and film-savvy as New York emerged as centers of neighborhood life.\nTheir selections mirror the people they serve, and their proprietors, like Mr. Dennis, can be beloved figures with a deep knowledge not only of local inhabitants' film tastes, but also of other aspects of their lives.\n\"I came in here once, and I said, 'My husband just got his teeth pulled,' \" said Maxine McClintock, a longtime Movie Place customer. \"'What's a good movie to watch when your teeth are pulled?' \" Mr. Dennis recommended some screwball comedies, including \"Libeled Lady,\" a 1936 film with Spencer Tracy, William Powell and Myrna Loy.\nSalvatore Ierardo, the liquidation director for Video One Liquidators, a Florida company that sells off video stores' inventories on site, sees the deaths of these shops firsthand. The stores are like \"the guy that used to deliver ice,\" he said, adding, \"He worked hard and everything, but the refrigerator was working while he was sleeping.\" As for customers' reaction to the demise, Mr. Ierardo said: \"They know it's inevitable, but they don't feel comfortable. They know it's been there a long time standing.\"\nMom-and-Pops in Peril\nThe final scene in the story of Movie Place began last April, when its building was sold. Mr. Dennis had no lease, and his new landlord, Ralph Braha, offered him one at a monthly rent of $7,500, more than double what he was paying. Jay Litzman, a lawyer for Mr. Braha, said in an interview, \"When you're in a commercial setting and you don't have a lease and someone takes over, you expect that the market will be reached.\"\nIn the middle of last month, Mr. Dennis decided to fold his hand and close his store by Dec. 1. He does not plan to open a new one; business is too sluggish these days, he said, and his heart isn't in it.\n\"Starting again would be like going back to an old girlfriend,\" he said. \"I'd always be second-guessing myself.\"\nCompared with some other video stores, Movie Place has not fared badly. For years, it resisted the forces that have been sweeping away many of the city's other mom-and-pop video shops. Nationally, the number of privately owned video rental shops, as opposed to huge chains, fell to roughly 13,000 in 2005 from about 22,000 in 1996, according to Tom Adams, president of Adams Media Research, which tracks the entertainment industry.\nThe mom-and-pops were weakened by the rise of chains like Blockbuster, Hollywood Video and Movie Gallery, which together added almost 5,000 stores between 1996 and 2004, striking deals with the studios that gave them dozens of low-priced copies of hot new releases. Then the independents were buffeted by the arrival of cheap DVDs for sale, now a $16-billion-a-year business, along with the rise of Netflix and on-demand cable movies.\nThese trends have been especially harmful in New York, where rising rents are imperiling many small-margin businesses anyway. For New York, the list of casualties includes not only single-store video businesses but also small chains that have scaled back sharply or folded: Royal Video, Captain Video, Champagne Video.\nMr. Ierardo, the liquidation director, gets a knowing look from browsers when he is selling off a New York video store. \"Some people walk in and go, 'The rent, right?' \" he said.\nIn any event, the decline of these shops has left New York's many film lovers increasingly adrift. Until 2001, for example, the cognoscenti could hunt for Iranian or Bangladeshi films in the International Film and Video Center, an East Side store run by an Iranian film scholar. Until the mid-'90s, they could browse the sliding shelves at Video Shack, a pioneering sales-and-rental emporium near Times Square. Video Shack was such an early entrant to the business that it was selling videotapes before many customers knew what they were.\n\"People would come in one day, buy a video and then two days later, they'd bring it back because it didn't fit in their television,\" recalled the former owner, Arthur Morowitz. \"We had actually out-marketed the VCR.\"\nThe Corner Film Critic\nThe proprietors of many of the city's video stores often became film critics of last resort. North Heights Video in Brooklyn Heights, a defunct outlet run by the wry, hyper-opinionated Martin Arno, had a vast selection of obscure and foreign films (anyone for \"White Hell of Pitz Palu\" a 1929 silent about German mountaineering?). Mr. Arno was known to favor Hitchcock over Bergman. \"I watch a Bergman film,\" he once said, \"and I want to jump off a bridge.\"\nMr. Dennis of Movie Place, who named his 7-year-old daughter, Ava, in honor of Ava Gardner, has probably never been asked a film-related question he cannot answer. Once, a woman who was leaving her husband at home for the weekend asked Mr. Dennis, \"What are the movies he'd want to watch that I'd hate?\" Mr. Dennis's recommendations: \"U-571,\" a 2000 submarine thriller set during World War II, and \"The Seven-Ups,\" a 1973 police drama.\nBut the influence works both ways, with some shops coming to resemble their neighborhoods over the years, much as people and their pets are said to grow to look like each other.\nWorld of Video, still operating on Greenwich Avenue in the still heavily gay West Village, is known for its gay and lesbian collection. At Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que in Park Slope, the large number of local writers had a hand in determining what was on the shelves. Paul Auster, the novelist, repeatedly requested \"In a Lonely Place,\" a 1950 Humphrey Bogart movie about a hot-tempered screenwriter. Eventually, he got his wish.\nChannel Video, on Columbus Avenue on the Upper West Side, was shaped by its neighborhood of upscale cinephiles, people with highbrow but not obscure tastes. \"He had gathered a collection of art-house movies and Criterion DVDs and things the customers wanted,\" Mr. Ierardo said of David Cohn, the proprietor. \"They'd ask for something, he'd buy it.\"\nVideo stores are woven into the local fabric in other ways. A couple once asked Mr. Dennis if they could get married in his store. (He said no.) Some couples, among them Mr. Dennis and his wife, first met in the aisles. And last June, Mr. Dennis persuaded the city to give the name Humphrey Bogart Place to the block of 103rd Street west of Broadway, because the actor spent his early years there.\n\"I don't know how I'm going to live without it,\" John Reaves, a Movie Place patron, said the other day as he signed a petition to keep the store open. The petition was drafted by a local family, the Telushkins. Mr. Dennis was dubious about the petition's chances of success, but that did not keep Benjamin Telushkin, a 13-year-old Fellini fan, from sitting at a card table down the street with a giant oaktag sign and shouting, \"Save Movie Place!\"\nThe Frustrated 2,500\nThe Upper West Side is suffering through a spasm of late-stage gentrification, with many of its restaurants, shops and grocers replaced by bank branches and chain drugstores. Mr. Dennis himself drew loud applause at a meeting of Community Board 7 this month when he declared: \"Our neighborhood is becoming a punch line. You walk down Broadway, and it's a Flintstones background: Duane Reade, wireless place, Duane Reade, wireless place.\"\nUpper West Siders are particularly protective of all their institutions, but the demise of Movie Place seems to have touched a raw neighborhood nerve. With the help of his mother, Devorah, and sisters, Shira and Naomi, Benjamin Telushkin gathered 2,500 signatures on their petition.\nSuch local affection surfaced a few weeks ago when Matt Unger and Stephanie Ehrlich, the couple who had asked to be married at Movie Place, arrived at the store. They had just learned that it was closing.\nGrimacing, Mr. Unger said, \"That's one of these things that make you not want to live in New York anymore.\"\nMs. Ehrlich looked at her husband. \"What's Gary going to do?\" she asked.\n\"I don't know,\" Mr. Unger replied. \"He seems to only be good at one thing.\"\nIn fact, Mr. Dennis is making plans to sell off his inventory, perhaps to an online service. The only movies he wants to keep are \"Casablanca,\" \"A Night at the Opera\" and \"Orchestra Wives,\" a Glenn Miller musical. As for the rest, he said: \"Where are you going to keep it? My wife invented that phrase -- 'Oh, you're going to buy it? Where are you going to keep it?' New York's different.\" Besides, he added, \"this stuff'll show up on TV.\"\nHe spends part of every day fielding condolence calls, at least two dozen on a recent Monday. \"I'm available for parties and bar mitzvahs,\" he told one caller. Then, more gravely, he added: \"Don't worry. I'm chained to this neighborhood. They're going to bury me in Straus Park when the time comes.\" After shutting the store, Mr. Dennis may set up a movie Web site or, fittingly, write a book about defunct movie theaters.\nOne of the store's final visitors was Karen Young, an actress who plays an F.B.I. agent in \"The Sopranos\" and a romantic rival of Charlotte Rampling's in the 2006 film \"Heading South.\" Ms. Young, who lives two blocks from the store, raised her two children on slapstick Laurel and Hardy rented from Mr. Dennis, and she was shocked to hear of the closing. \"You know how hard those are to find?\" she said of those '30s comedies. \"This is awful.\"\n\"You can buy most of those on DVD now,\" Mr. Dennis said in a kind voice. Then he paused for a second. \"Not the shorts.\"\nThe Way They Were\" An unscientific sample of New York video stores that have closed shop, but live on in patrons' minds.\nChannel Video Columbus Avenue at 83rd Street 1987-2005 A cozy store with benches, a theater-style marquee, a popcorn machine and, for a time, a \"kid cave\" for children. Frequented by Upper West Side media and creative types, among them Peter Jennings, Kevin Bacon and Tony Randall.\nInternational Film And Video Center First Avenue near 54th Street 1981-2001 Strong on foreign films, some never released in the United States, and some not even viewable on American VCRs. Its vast two-floor selection was curated by Bahman Maghsoudlou, an Iranian film scholar, and many customers were diplomats from the nearby United Nations who were homesick for their native cinemas. Ad agencies and directors often used the collection as a stock house; an ad executive might ask for 100 videos about, say, Greece. A mail-order sales operation remains.\nVideo Shack 49th Street and Broadway 1978-1995 Flagship of a small rental and sale chain, this outlet ranked among the city's oldest and largest video stores. The sales arm printed thick, magazine-like catalogs and claimed to stock nearly every video ever distributed, while the rental store had special shelves that slid along each other, library style. Patrons included Woody Allen, Francis Ford Coppola and Brian De Palma. Directors and other notables autographed their film boxes there; when Duran Duran was signing a video in 1983, a near-riot broke out and mounted police officers were summoned. Thousands of fans had been waiting for hours, some of them shinnying up the nearby lampposts. Bought by RKO WarnerTheaters Video Inc. in 1986.\nNorth Heights Video Henry Street, Brooklyn Heights 1984-2005 Dingy carpeting, narrow aisles and an enormous selection. Known as Marty's for its sardonic, beloved owner, Martin Arno, who hated Ingmar Bergman, loved bad weather (good for business) and ran offbeat promotions like half-price \"dead-actress specials.\" Mr. Arno was the apparent inspiration for the main character in \"The Expense of Spirit,\" a well-reviewed Off Off Broadway play from 2004, about a good-hearted video store owner.\nVideo International Montague Street, Brooklyn Heights 1983-1993 This tiny second-floor store was lined floor to ceiling with videos. Its unparalleled TV section included items like all 17 episodes of \"The Prisoner,\" the cult British series from 1967. It had no listed phone number because the owners grew tired of paying someone to field inquiries full time.\nCin\u00e9math\u00e8que Seventh Avenue near Union Street, Park Slope 1993-2006 Well-stocked, fluorescent-lighted neighborhood store frequented by Park Slope's many writers and actors. John Turturro often dropped by -- his photo was on the wall -- as did Paul Auster, who said his wife was once addressed as \"Mrs. Turturro.\"\nVideo City Bath Avenue at 21st Avenue, Bensonhurst 1978-1998 One of Brooklyn's first video stores. Began with a 15-tape collection in the owner's apartment, back when VCRs cost $1,200 apiece, and labels had to be custom-made. (\"You couldn't buy VHS labels --'Please be kind, rewind,\"' said Phil Castellano, the former owner.) The first tape in the store's collection was \"Dirty Harry.\" According to Mr. Castellano, some customers cried when the place closed.\nVideo Station Metropolitan Avenue, Forest Hills 1979-2002 Perhaps Queens's largest video store, it offered the well-heeled local residents 16,000 films, including foreign movies such as the Russian version of \"Don Quixote.\" Some shelves were dedicated to certain directors, actors or nations; John Wayne, for instance, was represented by 50 titles. The store wasfamous for its special: 10 movies for $10 for 10 days. ALEX MINDLIN",

    "text": "States Take Lead in Push to Raise Minimum Wages\n2006-01-02T05:00:00.000Z\nDespite Congressional refusal for almost a decade to raise the federal minimum wage, nearly half of the civilian labor force lives in states where the pay is higher than the rate set by the federal government.\nSeventeen states and the District of Columbia have acted on their own to set minimum wages that exceed the $5.15 an hour rate set by the federal government, and this year lawmakers in dozens of the remaining states will debate raising the minimum wage. Some states that already have a higher minimum wage than the federal rate will be debating further increases and adjustments for inflation.\nThe last time the federal minimum wage was raised was in 1997 -- when it was increased from $4.75 an hour. Since then, efforts in Congress to increase the amount have been stymied largely by Republican lawmakers and business groups who argued that a higher minimum wage would drive away jobs.\nThwarted by Congress, labor unions and community groups have increasingly focused their efforts at raising the minimum wage on the states, where the issue has received more attention than in Republican-dominated Washington, said Bill Samuel, the legislative director of the national A.F.L.-C.I.O.\nOpinion polls show wide public support for an increase in the federal minimum wage, which falls far short of the income needed to place a family at the federal poverty level. Even the chairman of Wal-Mart has endorsed an increase, saying that a worker earning the minimum wage cannot afford to shop at his stores.\n\"The public is way ahead of Washington,\" Mr. Samuel said. \"They see this as a matter of basic fairness, the underpinning of basic labor law in this country, a floor under wages so we're not competing with Bangladesh.\"\nThe minimum wage has been the subject of fierce ideological debate since it was first established in 1938 under President Franklin D. Roosevelt as part of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Business groups and conservative economists have argued that the minimum wage is an unwarranted government intrusion into the employer-employee relationship and a distortion of the marketplace for labor. An increase in the minimum wage, they say, drives up labor costs across the board and freezes unskilled and first-time workers out of the job market.\n\"Increasing the minimum wage is a bad move economically, philosophically and politically,\" said Marc Freedman, director of labor law policy for the United States Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Freedman said that any minimum wage set by the federal government was completely arbitrary and did not take local labor market costs into account.\nAccording to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, about two million American workers, 2.7 percent of the overall work force, earned the minimum hourly wage of $5.15 or less in 2004, the last year for which such statistics were available. Those workers were generally young (half were under 25, and a quarter were teenagers), unmarried and had not earned a high school diploma. About three-fifths of all workers paid at or below the federal minimum wage worked in bars and restaurants, and many received tips to supplement their basic wages.\nAdvocates of an increase in the minimum wage said that inflation had so eroded the value of the minimum wage in the last nine years that it was worth less today in real terms than at any time since 1955. They also cited studies that found that raising the minimum wage did not cause job loss, as opponents argue. According to these studies, employers can absorb the higher labor costs through efficiencies, less employee turnover and higher productivity.\nTim Nesbitt, the former president of the Oregon A.F.L.-C.I.O., said that despite having one of the highest minimum wages in the country at $7.25 an hour, Oregon had had twice the rate of job growth as the rest of the country.\nThe 2006 battle over the minimum wage is expected to be particularly intense in Ohio, one of only two states that have a minimum wage below the federal level (the other is Kansas). The minimum wage in Ohio since 1991 has been $4.25 an hour, which applies to small employers, some farms and most restaurants. Workers at larger enterprises are generally covered by the federal minimum wage.\nEfforts to get the Republican-run General Assembly to consider raising Ohio's minimum wage have gone nowhere, so labor groups and the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, known as Acorn, an advocacy group for low-income individuals and families, are planning a ballot initiative to put the issue to a popular vote in November.\nTim Burga, legislative director for the Ohio A.F.L.-C.I.O., said that 92,000 workers in the state made less than the federal minimum wage, some as little as $2 an hour. The proposed Ohio Constitutional amendment would set the state minimum wage at $6.85 an hour, indexed to future inflation, bringing an immediate raise to as many as 400,000 workers.\nFormer Senator John Edwards, the 2004 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, said in an interview that he planned to help organize the minimum wage campaign in Ohio as part of his national campaign to alleviate poverty. He called the current minimum wage a moral disgrace and a national embarrassment.\n\"My view is it should be $7.50 an hour, and I can make a great argument for it being a lot higher than that,\" Mr. Edwards said. \"This is a perfect example of the Republican leadership in Congress, combined with the powerful presence of lobbies in Washington, thwarting the will of the people.\"\nLeading the opposition to the initiative will be the Ohio Restaurant Association, which like its parent organization, the National Restaurant Association, closely monitors and vigorously opposes efforts to raise the minimum wage.\n\"Restaurants are a low-margin business,\" said Geoff Hetrick, president of the Ohio Restaurant Association. \"A number of marginal operations which are more or less on the ragged edge right now might find this to be the straw that breaks the camel's back, especially in northern Ohio where they've had a significant loss in manufacturing employment that's taken a lot of disposable income out of the economy.\"\nOne of those who would be affected by the proposed minimum wage increase in Ohio is Rick Cassara, owner of John Q's Steakhouse in downtown Cleveland. He said that while all of his 55 employees currently earn more than the minimum wage, he opposed a mandated increase because it would drive up all of his labor costs. \"It exerts upward pressure on all wages and prices,\" Mr. Cassara said. \"If the minimum wage is $7 and I have to pay $8 or $9 to hire a dishwasher, then the cooks are going to say they want more. How much can I charge for that hamburger?\"\nAnother small employer, Dan Young, owner of Young's Jersey Dairy in Yellow Springs, a working farm and restaurant operation, said that more than half of his 300 workers were high school and college students, many of them in their first jobs. He said he paid many of them $5.25 an hour, just above the federal minimum wage, but most quickly won raises or earned far more than that in tips.\nMr. Young said that if Ohio enacted a Democratic proposal to raise the state's minimum wage by $1 an hour over the federal level, his labor costs would go up by $250,000 a year or more. \"When you do all the math,\" he said, \"I'll have to figure out a way to hire fewer workers, or raise prices, or both.\"\nIn 2004, voters in Nevada and Florida approved ballot initiatives raising the state minimum wage to $6.15 an hour, in both cases by more than a 2-to-1 margin. Nevada voters must vote on the measure again this year because it is a Constitutional amendment, but proponents are confident they will prevail. Lawmakers in California, which already has one of the highest rates in the nation at $6.75 an hour, approved a bill last year to increase the wage to $7.75 an hour in 2007, but Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed it, the second time he has rejected such legislation.\nMr. Schwarzenegger said then that he believed that low-wage California workers deserved a raise, but said the legislation, which contained automatic increases tied to inflation, would be too costly to employers.\nBut aides to Mr. Schwarzenegger said late last week that the governor would propose a $1-an-hour increase in the California minimum wage in his State of the State address this week. If approved, the proposal would take effect over the next 18 months and would not have an automatic inflation adjustment, the aides said. The move appears designed in part to pre-empt a ballot initiative that would raise the California hourly rate an additional $1, to $8.75 an hour, and include annual cost-of-living increases.\nInflation indexing is also an issue in Oregon, where the minimum wage is currently $7.25 an hour and adjusts every year for inflation under an initiative approved by voters in 2002. Each year since passage of that measure, the Oregon Restaurant Association and other business groups have pushed legislation to cancel the indexing provision or to exempt some workers from the wage law, but have so far failed. Gov. Theodore R. Kulongoski, a Democrat and former labor lawyer, has vowed to veto any such measure that reaches his desk.",

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.\nMuseums\n \u2605 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: \u2018GOLD,\u2019 through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100. (Roberta Smith)\n  \u2605 Bronx Museum of the Arts: \u2018Tropicalia: A Revolution in Brazilian Culture,\u2019 through Jan. 28. Tropicalia, or Tropicalism, wasn\u2019t a style or a movement as much as an atmosphere, a rush of youthful, cosmopolitan, liberating optimism that broke over Brazil in the late 1960s like a sun shower, and soaked into everything \u0097 art, music, film, theater and architecture \u0097 until a military government clamped down. This show is an attempt to recapture the moment\u2019s fugitive spirit, and with the presence of artists like Helio Oiticica and Lygia Clark, the architect Lina Bo Bardi, and musicians like Gilberto Gil, it comes close. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)\n BROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018ANNIE LEIBOVITZ: A PHOTOGRAPHER\u2019S LIFE, 1990-2005,\u2019 through Jan. 21. With photographs of her close-knit family and her companion, Susan Sontag; bits of photojournalism; and a pretentious foray into landscape photography, this large exhibition tells you more about Ms. Leibovitz than you probably want to know. The first-person text labels don\u2019t help. Not surprisingly, her well-known celebrity portraits are strongest, and at their best in a re-creation of the large pin-up boards on which she plotted the lavish book that accompanies the show. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Smith)\nBROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018RON MUECK,\u2019 through Feb. 4. So intensely lifelike are the fiberglass and silicone human figures made by the Australian sculptor Ron Mueck that you might almost converse with them. Ranging in size from an infant that is 10 and a quarter inches high to a woman in bed more than 21 feet long, they seem to embody, in one way or another, the perils and challenges of the human condition. The most affecting are \u201cDead Dad,\u201d a 40-inch rendering of the artist\u2019s father as a nude corpse, and \u201cMan in a Boat,\u201d in which a man a little more than two feet high sits naked and hapless toward the prow of a life-size rowboat. But Mr. Mueck stumbles when he gets into really exaggerated scale. The subject has not earned its monumentality, and its size distracts from its emotional intensity. Still, there are moments when you almost believe his subjects have lives. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) \n \u2605 FRICK COLLECTION: \u2018DOMENICO TIEPOLO (1727-1804): A NEW TESTAMENT,\u2019  through Jan. 7. The 60 ink drawings by Domenico Tiepolo, son of the Italian master painter Giambattist, have a funny kind of jitter. They look as if they were maybe woven from hair-fine brambles, or done on a ride over rough ground, or in a state of agitated elation. Illustrations of episodes from the four Gospels, they are among some 300 drawings the artist did in a project that seems to have been an extended exercise in personal piety. In them the Christian story of salvation becomes an operatic epic, gravely serious, but with notes of homely sweetness: Jesus in Gethsemane delivers his aria of mortal doubt and pain high up on a bare stage, all alone; the Virgin Mary\u2019s mother, Anna, aged and stooped, is cosseted by angel-nurses, who guide her every step. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter)\n \u2605 FRICK COLLECTION: \u2018MASTERPIECES OF EUROPEAN PAINTING FROM THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART,\u2019 through Jan. 28. This exhibition transcends the usual traveling masterpieces-from genre, with room to spare. The 14 paintings include almost always outstanding works by household names like Vel\u00e1zquez, Caravaggio, El Greco, Turner and Poussin, as well as Annibale Carracci, Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n and Andrea del Sarto. But the astute installation makes the most of all this star power, letting the works talk among themselves to a remarkable degree, illuminating their likenesses, differences and collective progress. Extending John Berger\u2019s famous title, the show might be called \u201cWays of Seeing Paintings.\u201d (See above.) (Smith)\n \u2605 SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018LUCIO FONTANA: VENICE/NEW YORK,\u2019  through Jan. 21. If the Italian artist Lucio Fontana (1899-1968) was dazzled by Venice, he was positively awestruck by New York, which he first visited in 1961. For each city he created a group of works that he felt expressed its individual spirit. For Venice, a group of richly sensual oil paintings, with his signature slashes and punctures, evoked his personal experience of the lagoon city in glowing colors during the passage of a day. For New York he chose shiny metal surfaces, slashed and pierced to give a semblance of the wired energy and architectural vivacity he saw as the essence of the futuristic metropolis. The two groups are united for the first time, and well attended by works and photographs of works that trace from 1949 the career of an artist seeking to transcend the boundaries of his era. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Glueck) \n \u2605 SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018SPANISH PAINTING FROM EL GRECO TO PICASSO,\u2019 through March 28. This show is spectacularly grand and avoids the familiar piety of the standard masterpiece potpourri by virtue of its eloquent installation in the museum\u2019s loopy ramp, still the weirdest-coolest place to look at art and at other people looking at art. It\u2019s carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Vel\u00e1zquezes and Zurbar\u00e1ns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dal\u00eds and Picassos, many famous, many not. I can\u2019t tell you how often I was stopped by a picture so good or unexpected that it made me do a double take. The show\u2019s big point, which has the simple virtue of being self-evident, is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) \n METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018AMERICANS IN PARIS: 1860-1900,\u2019 through Jan. 28. The Americanization of the world may be a done deal now, but not so long ago the United States was a buyer rather than a seller of cultural information, and France was a major source between the Civil War and World War I. That\u2019s the story told in this exhibition. The basic ideas, though undeveloped, are inherently interesting, and the art, with some notable exceptions, is conservative and staid, especially when compared with work in the Met\u2019s Vollard show, done at the same time. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter) \n THE MET: \u2018COAXING THE SPIRITS TO DANCE,\u2019 through Sept. 3, 2007. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted \u201cspirit boards\u201d made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area\u2019s traditional artworks. Their central designs typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (See above.) (Glueck) \n MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: \u2018FRAGONARD AND THE FRENCH TRADITION\u2019 AND \u2018MOZART AT 250: A CELEBRATION,\u2019 through Jan. 7. Memorializing Mozart\u2019s 250th birthday and the 200th anniversary of the death of the French painter Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, these small, paired shows reflect the elegance and brio of 18th-century culture. The Fragonard display consists only of his drawings and those of some compatriots; 40 works in all, drawn almost entirely from the Morgan\u2019s collection. The show effectively displays the virtuosity and variety of Fragonard\u2019s many styles, from his skills at depicting foliage-filled landscapes and the play of water in fountains and streams, to his keenness at capturing people, mythological scenes and ephemeral creatures. Although the works in the Mozart display \u0097 letters and musical scores \u0097 are in quite a different visual language, they go very happily with the Fragonard group. And you can hear excerpts from the manuscripts at two different listening stations in the show. 255 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Glueck)\n \u2605 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: \u2018MANET AND THE EXECUTION OF MAXIMILIAN,\u2019 through Jan. 29. This small, gripping, focused show remind us of Modernism\u2019s mutinous, myth-scouring origins. And it does so by bringing one of art\u2019s great path-cutters, Edouard Manet, onto the scene, wry, politically infuriated and painting like Lucifer. There\u2019s not a lot of him here: eight paintings, three on a single theme: the death by firing squad of the Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian in Mexico in 1867. But it\u2019s enough. Manet\u2019s images, surrounded here by a selection of prints and photographs, are electrifying, a new kind of history painting, that turned an art of pre-set ideals into one of mutable and unpredictable realities. (212) 708-9400. (Cotter)\n \u2605 MOMA: \u2018BRICE MARDEN: A RETROSPECTIVE OF PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS,\u2019 through Jan. 15. This quietly magnificent 40-year retrospective pays tribute to an artist who helped rebuild painting in the 1970s, working back from the brink of single-panel monochromes to elegant tangles of thick line on vibrant monochrome grounds that encompass a tremendous emotional range and sense of physical energy, and give the lie to the idea that any art can be purely formal or completely abstract. Mr. Marden converted the rule-ridden zone of Minimalist abstraction into a capacious yet disciplined place, pushing it toward landscape, the figure and its roots in Abstract Expressionism and beyond, in non-Western art. And he may have saved the best for last. (See above.) (Smith)\n \u2605 NEUE GALLERY: \u2018JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,\u2019 through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or \u201ctotal work of art,\u201d orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Many objects were executed by the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte, an artists\u2019 collaborative that insisted on the handmade component of good design, founded by him with the painter and designer Kolomon Moser. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. And there are photographs of many buildings he designed, including the Palais Stoclet in Brussels, an ultraluxurious home for a millionaire that he considered his best Gesamkunstwerk. Though focused on interiors, the show conveys the basic ideas of a designer immersed in a new vision. Neue Gallery, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)\n  NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: \u2018NEW YORK DIVIDED: SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR,\u2019 through Sept. 3. New York has a cosmopolitan pride in itself, but as this exhibition shows, it is not always well deserved. Even after slavery belatedly came to an end in New York State in 1827, New York City was a \u201chotbed of pro-slavery politics,\u201d inspired by close commercial links with the South and the international cotton trade. For every instance of abolitionist activity, there is another in which slavery is defended or supported. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historic objects, shows how divided the city was, even during the years of the Civil War. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery\u2019s horrific heritage. The exhibition brings to a close the Historical Society\u2019s multi-year exploration of slavery in New York. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400.(Edward Rothstein)\n \u2605 UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: \u2018CROSSROADS: MODERNISM IN UKRAINE, 1910-1930,\u2019 through March 11. Some of the great names in Modernist Russian art \u0097 Malevich, El Lissitsky, Rodchenko, Archipenko and Exter \u0097 were actually born, or identified themselves as, Ukrainian. And this show of more than 70 works by 21 artists , including many interesting lesser-knowns, informs us that their Ukrainian-ness made an impact on their contributions to the Modernist movements of the 20th century. Discoveries in the show include Vsevolod Maksymovych, a painter drawing on Symbolist sources, heavily influenced by classical themes and the campy erotica of the British graphic artist Aubrey Beardsley; and Anatol Petrytsky, a painter and creator of lighthearted, collagelike sketches for classical and avant-garde opera and ballet. Stressing as it does the importance of Ukrainian participation in Modernist art, the show is equally significant in its exposure to Americans of lively talents, largely unknown. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212) 228-0110, ukrainianmuseum.org. (Glueck)\n  \u2605 THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018ALBERS AND MOHOLY-NAGY: FROM THE BAUHAUS TO THE NEW WORLD,\u2019 through Jan. 21. This vigorously multimedia show traces the trajectories of two Modernist pioneers who overlapped as teachers at the Bauhaus in the 1920s and went on, separately, to influence postwar art and design in the United States. Ranging through painting, sculpture, film, design, prints and commercial art, it clarifies the Bauhaus debt to Russian Constructivism and includes works that presage the \u201cspecific objects\u201d of the 1960s. Given the peregrinations of young artists among multiple art media, the show could not be more pertinent. The less-known Moholy-Nagy looks especially adventuresome. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Smith) \n WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: KIKI SMITH: \u2018A GATHERING, 1980-2005,\u2019 through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float in \u201cKiki Smith\u201d: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum\u2019s black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith\u2019s art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed to its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th St, (212) 570-3676. (Cotter)\nGalleries: Chelsea\n STEVE MUMFORD: \u2018THE WAR IN IRAQ\u2019 Mr. Mumford this exhibition of paintings based on field drawings and sketches done in four trips to Iraq from April 2003 to October 2004, during which he was embedded with United States military units in Baghdad and the Sunni Triangle. His paintings function differently from news photographs and television images \u0097 they are not so mediated, which is one reason, perhaps, that they are so arresting. Some of his paintings combine drawings or photographs of events he witnessed and those that happened nearby, like his epic, cinematic work \u201cThe Battle of Baquba\u201d (2006). Postmasters Gallery, 459 West 19th Street, through Dec. 2, (212) 727 3323 or www.postmastersart.com. (Benjamin Genocchio)\n Last Chance\nERNESTO NETO: \u2018FROM WHAT WE ARE MADE\u2019 Mr. Neto presents his version of the miracle of human conception with a luminous white tent the shape of a rainbow, with a thick foam floor, filled with a pile of small, colorful soft sculptures made in pantyhose fabric and stuffed with buckwheat shells. As the viewer enters the space, the floor shifts and subsides, tossing the sculptures and making it hard to stay upright. It is like traversing a marshmallow or wading through a pool of jelly, though with the phantasmagoria of a funhouse in which we can climb and play. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Genocchio)\n \u2605 \u2018PHANTOM CAPTAIN: ART AND CROWDSOURCING\u2019 According to the curator Andrea Grover, \u201ccrowdsourcing\u201d is a new form of corporate outsourcing that parcels out work to armies of amateurs, and the concept is applied to art in this smart little show of ultracolloaborative projects. Harrell Fletcher and Miranda July posted project assignments on their Web site, www.learningtoloveyoumore.com, and present the work of the respondents. Davy Rothbart edits a magazine made up entirely of found notes, photos and letters contributed by readers; a wall full of such material is here.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.\nNINA KATCHADOURIAN This artist\u2019s recently installed \u201cOffice Semaphore\u201d in Lower Manhattan is a zesty homage to the maritime flag signaling systems used by ships to convey messages to one another. The work, an interactive Public Art Fund project, consists of an old-fashioned tourist telescope, above, at the corner of a plaza in the middle of the financial district, its lens trained on the window of an upper-floor office in a nearby skyscraper. Each day the man working in the office, or his assistant, arranges objects on his window sill. The combinations and order of objects \u2014 mostly office supplies and personal items and effects \u2014 convey a message, like a semaphore, which viewers down on the plaza can interpret using a key-chart on the telescope. Changed a few times a day, sometimes more frequently, the arrangements indicate the subject\u2019s mood, productivity and overall workplace conditions. The day I took a peek, the objects included a calculator, a potted plant and a jar filled with binder clips, code for \u201cI am drifting.\u201d If you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll even get to see the office subject \u2014 a middle-aged corporate lawyer whom the artist has asked to remain anonymous \u2014 at his desk, on the telephone or interacting with colleagues. It\u2019s like \u201cRear Window\u201d crossed with an episode of \u201cThe Office.\u201d (\u201cOffice Semaphore,\u201d 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, corner of Liberty and William Streets, through Jan. 14. Stairway entrance to the plaza is on William Street at Cedar Street. Information: www.publicartfund.org.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO\nMuseums\n \u2605 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: \u2018GOLD,\u2019 through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100. (Roberta Smith)\n  \nBROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018RON MUECK,\u2019 through Feb. 4. So intensely lifelike are the fiberglass and silicone human figures made by the Australian sculptor Ron Mueck that you might almost converse with them. Ranging in size from an infant that is 10 and a quarter inches high to a woman in bed more than 21 feet long, they seem to embody, in one way or another, the perils and challenges of the human condition. The most affecting are \u201cDead Dad,\u201d a 40-inch rendering of the artist\u2019s father as a nude corpse, and \u201cMan in a Boat,\u201d in which a man a little more than two feet high sits naked and hapless toward the prow of a life-size rowboat. But Mr. Mueck stumbles when he gets into really exaggerated scale. The subject has not earned its monumentality, and its size distracts from its emotional intensity. Still, there are moments when you almost believe his subjects have lives. 200 Eastern Parkway at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck)  BROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018WATERCOLORS BY WALTON FORD,\u2019 through Jan. 28. This show assembles more than 50 of Mr. Ford\u2019s large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora, all produced since the early 1990s. They frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images you merely sense that some horrible violence has occurred, or is about to happen. Though wonderfully lucid and dramatic, the moralizing of these images can become a little tedious. But this popular artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. (See above.) \n(Benjamin Genocchio)\n \u2605 FRICK COLLECTION: \u2018MASTERPIECES OF EUROPEAN PAINTING FROM THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART,\u2019 through Jan. 28. This exhibition transcends the usual traveling masterpieces-from genre, with room to spare. The 14 paintings include almost always outstanding works by household names like Vel\u00e1zquez, Caravaggio, El Greco, Turner and Poussin, as well as Annibale Carracci, Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n and Andrea del Sarto. But the astute installation makes the most of all this star power, letting the works talk among themselves to a remarkable degree, illuminating their likenesses, differences and collective progress. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Smith)\n \u2605 SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018SPANISH PAINTING FROM EL GRECO TO PICASSO,\u2019 through March 28. This show is spectacularly grand and avoids the familiar piety of the standard masterpiece potpourri by virtue of its eloquent installation in the museum\u2019s loopy ramp. It\u2019s carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Vel\u00e1zquezes and Zurbar\u00e1ns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dal\u00eds and Picassos, many famous, many not. The show\u2019s big point, which has the simple virtue of being self-evident, is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. \n(Michael Kimmelman) \n \u2605 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920S,\u2019 through Feb. 19. This show\u2019s 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic\u2019s porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) \n \u2605 THE MET: \u2018LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL \u2014 AN ARTIST\u2019S COUNTRY ESTATE,\u2019 through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound \u2014 and of the Tiffany residences preceding it \u2014 is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany\u2019s genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (See above.) (Smith)\n \u2605 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: \u2018MANET AND THE EXECUTION OF MAXIMILIAN,\u2019 through Jan. 29. This small, gripping, focused show remind us of Modernism\u2019s mutinous, myth-scouring origins. And it does so by bringing one of art\u2019s great path-cutters, Edouard Manet, onto the scene, wry, politically infuriated and painting like Lucifer. There\u2019s not a lot of him here \u2014 eight paintings, three on a single theme: the death by firing squad of the Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian in Mexico in 1867. But it\u2019s enough. Manet\u2019s images, surrounded by a prints and photographs, are electrifying, a new kind of history painting, that turned an art of pre-set ideals into one of mutable and unpredictable realities. (212) 708-9400. (Holland Cotter)\n \u2605 NEUE GALLERY: \u2018JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,\u2019 through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or \u201ctotal work of art,\u201d orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. Neue Gallery, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)\n  NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: \u2018NEW YORK DIVIDED: SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR,\u2019 through Sept. 3. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historic objects, shows how divided the city was, even during the years of the Civil War. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery\u2019s horrific heritage. It brings to a close the Historical Society\u2019s multi-year exploration of slavery in New York. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400. (Edward Rothstein)\n P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: \u2018JOHN LATHAM: TIME BASE AND THE UNIVERSE,\u2019 through Jan. 8. This retrospective of John Latham, who died this year at 84, suggests a series of nesting time capsules. It spans nearly 50 years of Mr. Latham\u2019s work, which is concerned with time, preservation and decay. Among the more idiosyncratic and interesting pieces are a series of \u201cCluster\u201d sculptures from the early 1990s, orbs of plaster embedded with books and suspended from the ceiling, which suggest cultural detritus preserved in celestial rock or geological magma. \u201cThe N-U Niddrie Heart\u201d (around 1990), in which \u201cThe Pregnancy Survival Manual\u201d and \u201cVanished Species\u201d are cut up and fitted into glass armatures, with sand scattered around their bases, explores human production (and reproduction) and the passage of time. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. \n(Martha Schwendener)\n STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: \u2018AFRICA COMICS,\u2019 through March 18. Intense is the word for the stealth-potency of this modest-size, first-time United States survey of original designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense, the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. The entertainment value is high. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids, and the schlumpy but wily character named Goorgoolou from Senegal. But more often than not, humor is sugar-coating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter) \n \u2605 UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: \u2018CROSSROADS: MODERNISM IN UKRAINE, 1910-1930,\u2019 through March 11. Some of the great names in Modernist Russian art \u2014 Malevich, El Lissitsky, Rodchenko, Archipenko and Exter \u2014 were actually born, or identified themselves as, Ukrainian. And this show of more than 70 works by 21 artists, including many interesting lesser-knowns, informs us that their Ukrainian-ness made an impact on their contributions to the Modernist movements of the 20th century. Discoveries in the show include Vsevolod Maksymovych, a painter drawing on Symbolist sources, heavily influenced by classical themes and the campy erotica of the British graphic artist Aubrey Beardsley; and Anatol Petrytsky, a painter and creator of lighthearted, collagelike sketches for classical and avant-garde opera and ballet. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212) 228-0110, ukrainianmuseum.org. (Glueck)\n  \u2605 THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018ALBERS AND MOHOLY-NAGY: FROM THE BAUHAUS TO THE NEW WORLD,\u2019 through Jan. 21. This vigorously multimedia show traces the trajectories of two Modernist pioneers who overlapped as teachers at the Bauhaus in the 1920s and went on, separately, to influence postwar art and design in the United States. Ranging through painting, sculpture, film, design, prints and commercial art, it clarifies the Bauhaus debt to Russian Constructivism and includes works that presage the \u201cspecific objects\u201d of the 1960s. Given the peregrinations of young artists among multiple art media, the show could not be more pertinent. The less-known Moholy-Nagy looks especially adventuresome. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Smith) \n WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: KIKI SMITH: \u2018A GATHERING, 1980-2005,\u2019 through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float in \u201cKiki Smith\u201d: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum\u2019s black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith\u2019s art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed to its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. (See above.) (Cotter)\nGalleries: Chelsea\nFRED W. MCDARRAH: \u2018ARTISTS AND WRITERS OF THE 60S AND 70S\u2019 This show of more than 100 photographs by the former Village Voice photographer and picture editor Fred W. McDarrah opens with a shot of Jack Kerouac and some frolicsome women at a 1958 New Year\u2019s Eve bash. It is hastily grabbed and opportunistic, like much of Mr. McDarrah\u2019s work, for he operated independently, rarely working on assignment. There are groupings of artists in their studios (Alice Neel, Philip Guston, Jasper Johns); actors (Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro on the set of \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d); and musicians (Janis Joplin, Bob Dylan). Mr. McDarrah\u2019s best-known image may be his 1965 close-up of Bob Dylan, dressed all in black and saluting, his countenance as earnest as that of a battle-hardened marine. It is an enduring symbol of the era\u2019s antiwar protests, rebellion and counterculture. Steven Kasher Gallery521 West 23rd Street, (212) 966-3978, stevenkasher.com, through Jan. 5. (Genocchio)\nOther Galleries\n \u2605 \u2018POLITICAL CARTOONS FROM NIGERIA\u2019 Most of the drawn and painted images here are single-panel lampoons of past and present social inequity and corruption in Nigeria. Nearly all are by Ghariokwu Lemi, famous for his 26 superb, incident-filled album covers for Fela Kuti. For the occasion, the artist introduces two younger colleagues, Comfort Jacobs and Lordwealth Ololade, to New York. Without at all resembling him in style, they follow his sharp commentarial lead. Southfirst, 60 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-4884, through Dec. 17. (Cotter)\nLast Chance\n STEVE MUMFORD: \u2018THE WAR IN IRAQ\u2019 This exhibition of paintings is based on Mr. Mumford\u2019s field drawings and sketches done in four trips to Iraq from April 2003 to October 2004. His paintings function differently from news photographs and television images \u2014 they are not so mediated, which is one reason, perhaps, that they are so arresting.

    "text": "Mothers of Nepal Vanquish a Killer of Children\n2006-04-30T05:00:00.000Z\nLO MANTHANG, Nepal - As dusk descended on this medieval walled city and its dirt lanes filled with horses cantering home from the mountains, the piercing voice of a woman could be heard over the pounding hooves.\n\"Come for the measles vaccination tomorrow!\" Deki Gurung shouted to a neighbor.\n\"I know, I know, I got the invitation,\" the neighbor replied with a roll of her eyes as she peered over her balcony.\nAcross the impoverished kingdom of Nepal, 50,000 mothers like Mrs. Gurung, most of them illiterate, are foot soldiers in one of the great unfolding public health triumphs of modern times: the global push to slash the number of children who die from complications of measles.\nNepal's first national measles vaccination campaign last year cut by 90 percent the country's measles-related deaths, usually about 5,000 per year, the United Nations Children's Fund estimates.\nBut remarkable as it is, that tremendous success is overshadowed by the grievous toll measles continues to take in neighboring India. Experts estimate that more than 100,000 children a year still die there from complications of measles for want of a 15 cent vaccine.\nThe contrast between the nations highlights both the extraordinary promise of measles control, and the tragedy of its unfulfilled potential.\nNepal's campaign shows that quick, deep inroads can be made against measles with the proper financing and national will, as well as a tested strategy for winning public trust of vaccines.\n\"Vaccinating children against measles is the greatest return on investment for child health that we have,\" said Dr. Mark Grabowsky, who for five years was the adviser to the Red Cross for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"It's the low-hanging fruit.\"\nStill, measles kills 450,000 children worldwide each year. India, which has more measles-related deaths than any other country, has not made it a national priority in the way Nepal, Bangladesh and countries across Africa have. It has instead focused on its drive to eradicate polio, building a stronger rural health care system and bolstering immunization generally, in hopes of protecting children from other diseases.\nTackling a Disease\nIndia's choice highlights a fierce but little noticed debate among international public health experts: whether it is better to attack a single disease with big campaigns or instead make long-term investments to improve public health systems.\nIndeed, the crux of measles control is strong routine immunization, which is best provided by a solidly run health care system.\nThe vaccine is 85-to-90-percent effective in the first year of life. But the airborne measles virus is so contagious that a second vaccination, given either routinely or in a mass campaign, is often needed. It is that second dose that India does not yet provide all its children.\nSuch second-dose campaigns, reaching into the world's most remote corners, have saved a million children since 1999, the World Health Organization says.\nThe strategy, first used in Latin America in 1994, eliminated measles from the Western Hemisphere by 2002. In Africa, the approach has more than halved measles-related deaths in just four years. Measles weakens children's immune systems, making them vulnerable to fatal complications from diarrhea, pneumonia and malnutrition.\nNepal used the same plan, but several other things went right here. Not only has Nepal's measles effort been unburdened by competition from polio, which was wiped out six years ago, but also for more than a decade Nepal has used a highly organized network of volunteer mothers to deliver simple health services in the lanes around their homes.\nLocal human rights workers, part of a broad alliance of civic groups supporting the campaign, also played a critical role. They mediated disputes between government officials and Maoist rebels who have led a decade-long insurrection. \"We have taken this campaign as an issue of national prestige,\" said Dr. Yasho Pradhan, Nepal's director of child health.\nNepal's crash campaign reduced the number of outbreaks to just one last year from 195 in 2004, Unicef reported. Vaccination teams combed the slums of Katmandu and trekked through treacherous mountain passes to reach every last child, 9 months to 14 years old.\n\"It was amazingly effective,\" said Dr. Suomi Sakai, the Unicef representative in Nepal.\nDisparate Approaches\nIn the jangling, chaotic lanes of places like Ghaziabad, just an hour's drive from the Indian capital, New Delhi, people call measles \"Mata,\" or mother, for the Hindu deity associated with the disease. The characteristic red rash is seen as a visitation of the goddess.\nOne morning last year, pushcart vendors, rickshaw drivers and laborers whose children had rashes or were recovering from them lined up in a small, dingy temple, tucked behind a candy shop.\nThe swami, Grishm Giri, 82, his long white beard hanging halfway down his stained tunic, explained that last year had brought twice the usual number of measles cases. He waved a staff of peacock feathers over each child and chanted prayers, collecting about 12 cents from each family.\nHis assistant, Niraj Giri, a middle-aged man in a saffron-colored shirt, measured the distance from the children's navels to their nipples with a string. \"We try to find out if the center of the navel is in the right place,\" the assistant said. \"If it is not, we correct it.\" He explained that this displacement of the center is the real cause of disease, a problem that can be fixed through the nerves by hitting the bottoms of a person's feet.\nAmong those waiting for help was Ram Pukar, a rickshaw driver, holding his 6-year-old daughter, Sujita, who was so sick her head lolled from side to side. Her long black hair hung like a matted screen across her face.\nMr. Pukar's wife, Lalita Devi, cradled their 18-month-old son, Bisnu, also limp in her arms. Both children had a rash. Mr. Pukar, who is illiterate, said Sujita and Bisnu had been given polio drops many times, but had never been vaccinated for measles.\nThe asymmetry in resources to tackle polio and measles in this country is striking.\nIndia, home to one-sixth of the world's population, spent $216 million last year in its last-ditch effort to eradicate polio, which paralyzed 66 children in 2005. There was no comparable war chest for a measles drive.\nThe Measles Partnership, a coalition that includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, the Red Cross, the W.H.O. and Unicef, has led the drive globally. Last year, the partnership asked the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, an umbrella group of donor countries and organizations, for $479 million to accelerate measles campaigns around the world, with the biggest chunk of the money for India.\nThe alliance has committed only $147 million, funds available only because Britain, France and other countries agreed to raise the money on the bond markets.\nIn India, 5-year-olds in the northern states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar may well have been immunized against polio more than 20 times, while the overwhelming majority have never once been vaccinated for measles.\nFrom 1998 to 2003, surveys found that the proportion of children fully immunized against measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus and other diseases actually declined in three-quarters of the Indian districts for which there was data.\nAn expert assessment sponsored by the Indian government pointed to a variety of culprits, among them poor supervision, inadequate training, vaccine shortages and the emphasis given to polio.\nDr. Jay Wenger, who manages the national polio surveillance project for the W.H.O., disputed the idea that the polio push is to blame for problems in routine immunization, which often reflect deeper problems of misgovernance.\n\"Clearly, a lot of time is being spent on polio,\" Dr. Wenger said. \"It would be silly to say it's not.\" Nonetheless, there is still plenty of time to do routine immunization for measles, he said.\nBut Indian managers in the field say their workers, already stretched thin, have too little time for other tasks because large parts of the year are devoted to polio. \"The big casualty is the routine immunization,\" said Dr. Sudha Yadav, who works at a small hospital in the city of Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh.\nFor now, India is hoping to reduce measles deaths by strengthening rural health care and routine immunization, developing a cadre of 250,000 village women dedicated, as in Nepal, to improving services.\nDr. Anbumani Ramadoss, India's health minister, said in a recent interview that he hopes India can turn to measles soon.\nJulian Lob-Levyt, executive secretary of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, defends India's approach. \"In the long term, building a stronger basic health system will benefit many more people of all ages in all parts of societies,\" he said.\nBut for a country like India, forgoing measles campaigns will have a high price in deaths, particularly in states like Uttar Pradesh. Where state governments fail to deliver basic public health services, people often rely on traditional practices, like those at the temple in Ghaziabad.\nAfter an outbreak in Ghaziabad last year, Dr. M. P. Singh, the chief medical officer in the district, conceded that many children had not been immunized for measles. \"Before this outbreak, measles shots weren't given,\" he said.\nTwo of the confirmed deaths in Ghaziabad were the sons of a laborer, Kishore Lal. \"The child was in my lap when he breathed his last,\" Mr. Lal said, tears spilling down his gaunt cheeks as he described the death of Ramjanak, 5, last April. Amit, the other dead son, was 3.\nA month after Amit's death, Mr. Lal and his wife squatted listlessly in front of their small hut. \"We don't feel like working,\" he said. \"We don't feel like eating.\"\nIn a nearby lane, Tuntun Paswan, 32, and his wife, Ramdhana Devi, 28, also mourned the death of their son, Karan, 2. He passed away in the middle of the night in his mother's arms.\nThey buried the toddler, with his rattle and plastic bat, by the Hindon River.\nA Nation's Dedication\nWhile the Indian parents were still immobilized by grief, three porters were huffing and puffing through the mountains of Nepal, each hauling 100 pounds of vaccines and other supplies. They scaled narrow, rocky trails that snaked along the deepest gorge on earth.\nWinds roared with oceanic force, curling around them like giant waves. The shifting boxes of supplies, held in place by straps around the men's foreheads, scraped the skin on their backs.\nIt was only through extraordinary efforts like these last summer that the last Nepalese children to be vaccinated were reached in the nearly inaccessible Upper Mustang region. Similar, if less dramatic, scenes played out around the country as a carefully choreographed measles campaign unfolded over nine months.\nOutsiders who came for the campaign, including health workers and monitors from Unicef, journeyed over desolate mountains, some rising more than 13,000 feet, into a time before cellphones and televisions.\nWhen they finally crested the last bone-colored peak, the walled town of Lo Manthang lay before them. Some 600 years ago, this small kingdom sat astride a major trans-Himalayan trading route. Conditions are still medieval. Horses and cows live on the first floor of people's homes. Toilets are just holes in the floor above the stables.\nYet despite Lo Manthang's isolation and primitive facilities, the townspeople mounted a meticulous, if homespun, measles campaign.\nThe women who volunteered, organized by the government down to the ward level, delivered invitations to each household by hand, then followed up the night before with a reminder visit, shouting their message like town criers.\nOver the years, they have distributed 2 cent doses of Vitamin A to children, an intervention that cuts child mortality by almost a quarter, studies have shown. They have handed out de-worming tablets that cost a penny and slash infant mortality. They have handed out packets of oral rehydration salts that cost only 6 cents to save the lives of children with diarrhea.\nAnd they have gone door to door to take children to the clinic for immunizations.\nIn a country where the status of women is low, these illiterate mothers say they willingly do a job that pays no salary because it gives them a way to contribute and win respect.\n\"If I didn't tell them about vaccination programs or medicines, they wouldn't know,\" said Doka Gurung, a 30-year-old mother of four who has volunteered for a decade. \"I do help them, and I feel good about that.\"\nBy 8 the morning of the campaign, parents and children were lining up at Lo Manthang's small, rustic clinic. The volunteers covered the eyes of children who howled in fear as health workers approached with needles, then hustled out to fetch the boys and girls who had not shown up.\nNot so many years ago, before routine immunization took hold, measles outbreaks were common. The disease spared no one, not even royalty.\nThe king of Mustang, Jigme Palbar Bista, 73, a direct descendant of the original, 15th-century monarch, offered his own memories of a time before modern medicine arrived.\nHe held court on the top floor of his medieval palace, reached by a steep, narrow wooden staircase. Bearish Tibetan mastiffs with bloodshot eyes paced menacingly, guarding him.\nFingering prayer beads, the king recalled that as a child he had had measles, but survived while many others died. \"I've seen myself, just 10, 15 years ago, three children in one family die within three days,\" he said.\nThe measles campaign in Lo Manthang, a bastion of Tibetan Buddhist culture, concluded this day at The Great Compassion Sakyapa Monastic School.\nThe principal, Wangdi Sangbo, 33, welcomed the vaccinators. He himself had almost died during a measles outbreak when he was 10 years old. \"There were no doctors, no vaccinations,\" he said.\nThe next generation of boys he hoped to protect, he said, with help from the community. They gathered in the school's courtyard, laughing and teasing one another.\nPhuntsok Sangbo, 13, was so scared he hid, but his friends tracked him down and led him back.

    "text": "Mothers of Nepal Vanquish a Killer of Children\n2006-04-30T05:00:00.000Z\nLO MANTHANG, Nepal - As dusk descended on this medieval walled city and its dirt lanes filled with horses cantering home from the mountains, the piercing voice of a woman could be heard over the pounding hooves.\n\"Come for the measles vaccination tomorrow!\" Deki Gurung shouted to a neighbor.\n\"I know, I know, I got the invitation,\" the neighbor replied with a roll of her eyes as she peered over her balcony.\nAcross the impoverished kingdom of Nepal, 50,000 mothers like Mrs. Gurung, most of them illiterate, are foot soldiers in one of the great unfolding public health triumphs of modern times: the global push to slash the number of children who die from complications of measles.\nNepal's first national measles vaccination campaign last year cut by 90 percent the country's measles-related deaths, usually about 5,000 per year, the United Nations Children's Fund estimates.\nBut remarkable as it is, that tremendous success is overshadowed by the grievous toll measles continues to take in neighboring India. Experts estimate that more than 100,000 children a year still die there from complications of measles for want of a 15 cent vaccine.\nThe contrast between the nations highlights both the extraordinary promise of measles control, and the tragedy of its unfulfilled potential.\nNepal's campaign shows that quick, deep inroads can be made against measles with the proper financing and national will, as well as a tested strategy for winning public trust of vaccines.\n\"Vaccinating children against measles is the greatest return on investment for child health that we have,\" said Dr. Mark Grabowsky, who for five years was the adviser to the Red Cross for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"It's the low-hanging fruit.\"\nStill, measles kills 450,000 children worldwide each year. India, which has more measles-related deaths than any other country, has not made it a national priority in the way Nepal, Bangladesh and countries across Africa have. It has instead focused on its drive to eradicate polio, building a stronger rural health care system and bolstering immunization generally, in hopes of protecting children from other diseases.\nTackling a Disease\nIndia's choice highlights a fierce but little noticed debate among international public health experts: whether it is better to attack a single disease with big campaigns or instead make long-term investments to improve public health systems.\nIndeed, the crux of measles control is strong routine immunization, which is best provided by a solidly run health care system.\nThe vaccine is 85-to-90-percent effective in the first year of life. But the airborne measles virus is so contagious that a second vaccination, given either routinely or in a mass campaign, is often needed. It is that second dose that India does not yet provide all its children.\nSuch second-dose campaigns, reaching into the world's most remote corners, have saved a million children since 1999, the World Health Organization says.\nThe strategy, first used in Latin America in 1994, eliminated measles from the Western Hemisphere by 2002. In Africa, the approach has more than halved measles-related deaths in just four years. Measles weakens children's immune systems, making them vulnerable to fatal complications from diarrhea, pneumonia and malnutrition.\nNepal used the same plan, but several other things went right here. Not only has Nepal's measles effort been unburdened by competition from polio, which was wiped out six years ago, but also for more than a decade Nepal has used a highly organized network of volunteer mothers to deliver simple health services in the lanes around their homes.\nLocal human rights workers, part of a broad alliance of civic groups supporting the campaign, also played a critical role. They mediated disputes between government officials and Maoist rebels who have led a decade-long insurrection. \"We have taken this campaign as an issue of national prestige,\" said Dr. Yasho Pradhan, Nepal's director of child health.\nNepal's crash campaign reduced the number of outbreaks to just one last year from 195 in 2004, Unicef reported. Vaccination teams combed the slums of Katmandu and trekked through treacherous mountain passes to reach every last child, 9 months to 14 years old.\n\"It was amazingly effective,\" said Dr. Suomi Sakai, the Unicef representative in Nepal.\nDisparate Approaches\nIn the jangling, chaotic lanes of places like Ghaziabad, just an hour's drive from the Indian capital, New Delhi, people call measles \"Mata,\" or mother, for the Hindu deity associated with the disease. The characteristic red rash is seen as a visitation of the goddess.\nOne morning last year, pushcart vendors, rickshaw drivers and laborers whose children had rashes or were recovering from them lined up in a small, dingy temple, tucked behind a candy shop.\nThe swami, Grishm Giri, 82, his long white beard hanging halfway down his stained tunic, explained that last year had brought twice the usual number of measles cases. He waved a staff of peacock feathers over each child and chanted prayers, collecting about 12 cents from each family.\nHis assistant, Niraj Giri, a middle-aged man in a saffron-colored shirt, measured the distance from the children's navels to their nipples with a string. \"We try to find out if the center of the navel is in the right place,\" the assistant said. \"If it is not, we correct it.\" He explained that this displacement of the center is the real cause of disease, a problem that can be fixed through the nerves by hitting the bottoms of a person's feet.\nAmong those waiting for help was Ram Pukar, a rickshaw driver, holding his 6-year-old daughter, Sujita, who was so sick her head lolled from side to side. Her long black hair hung like a matted screen across her face.\nMr. Pukar's wife, Lalita Devi, cradled their 18-month-old son, Bisnu, also limp in her arms. Both children had a rash. Mr. Pukar, who is illiterate, said Sujita and Bisnu had been given polio drops many times, but had never been vaccinated for measles.\nThe asymmetry in resources to tackle polio and measles in this country is striking.\nIndia, home to one-sixth of the world's population, spent $216 million last year in its last-ditch effort to eradicate polio, which paralyzed 66 children in 2005. There was no comparable war chest for a measles drive.\nThe Measles Partnership, a coalition that includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, the Red Cross, the W.H.O. and Unicef, has led the drive globally. Last year, the partnership asked the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, an umbrella group of donor countries and organizations, for $479 million to accelerate measles campaigns around the world, with the biggest chunk of the money for India.\nThe alliance has committed only $147 million, funds available only because Britain, France and other countries agreed to raise the money on the bond markets.\nIn India, 5-year-olds in the northern states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar may well have been immunized against polio more than 20 times, while the overwhelming majority have never once been vaccinated for measles.\nFrom 1998 to 2003, surveys found that the proportion of children fully immunized against measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus and other diseases actually declined in three-quarters of the Indian districts for which there was data.\nAn expert assessment sponsored by the Indian government pointed to a variety of culprits, among them poor supervision, inadequate training, vaccine shortages and the emphasis given to polio.\nDr. Jay Wenger, who manages the national polio surveillance project for the W.H.O., disputed the idea that the polio push is to blame for problems in routine immunization, which often reflect deeper problems of misgovernance.\n\"Clearly, a lot of time is being spent on polio,\" Dr. Wenger said. \"It would be silly to say it's not.\" Nonetheless, there is still plenty of time to do routine immunization for measles, he said.\nBut Indian managers in the field say their workers, already stretched thin, have too little time for other tasks because large parts of the year are devoted to polio. \"The big casualty is the routine immunization,\" said Dr. Sudha Yadav, who works at a small hospital in the city of Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh.\nFor now, India is hoping to reduce measles deaths by strengthening rural health care and routine immunization, developing a cadre of 250,000 village women dedicated, as in Nepal, to improving services.\nDr. Anbumani Ramadoss, India's health minister, said in a recent interview that he hopes India can turn to measles soon.\nJulian Lob-Levyt, executive secretary of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, defends India's approach. \"In the long term, building a stronger basic health system will benefit many more people of all ages in all parts of societies,\" he said.\nBut for a country like India, forgoing measles campaigns will have a high price in deaths, particularly in states like Uttar Pradesh. Where state governments fail to deliver basic public health services, people often rely on traditional practices, like those at the temple in Ghaziabad.\nAfter an outbreak in Ghaziabad last year, Dr. M. P. Singh, the chief medical officer in the district, conceded that many children had not been immunized for measles. \"Before this outbreak, measles shots weren't given,\" he said.\nTwo of the confirmed deaths in Ghaziabad were the sons of a laborer, Kishore Lal. \"The child was in my lap when he breathed his last,\" Mr. Lal said, tears spilling down his gaunt cheeks as he described the death of Ramjanak, 5, last April. Amit, the other dead son, was 3.\nA month after Amit's death, Mr. Lal and his wife squatted listlessly in front of their small hut. \"We don't feel like working,\" he said. \"We don't feel like eating.\"\nIn a nearby lane, Tuntun Paswan, 32, and his wife, Ramdhana Devi, 28, also mourned the death of their son, Karan, 2. He passed away in the middle of the night in his mother's arms.\nThey buried the toddler, with his rattle and plastic bat, by the Hindon River.\nA Nation's Dedication\nWhile the Indian parents were still immobilized by grief, three porters were huffing and puffing through the mountains of Nepal, each hauling 100 pounds of vaccines and other supplies. They scaled narrow, rocky trails that snaked along the deepest gorge on earth.\nWinds roared with oceanic force, curling around them like giant waves. The shifting boxes of supplies, held in place by straps around the men's foreheads, scraped the skin on their backs.\nIt was only through extraordinary efforts like these last summer that the last Nepalese children to be vaccinated were reached in the nearly inaccessible Upper Mustang region. Similar, if less dramatic, scenes played out around the country as a carefully choreographed measles campaign unfolded over nine months.\nOutsiders who came for the campaign, including health workers and monitors from Unicef, journeyed over desolate mountains, some rising more than 13,000 feet, into a time before cellphones and televisions.\nWhen they finally crested the last bone-colored peak, the walled town of Lo Manthang lay before them. Some 600 years ago, this small kingdom sat astride a major trans-Himalayan trading route. Conditions are still medieval. Horses and cows live on the first floor of people's homes. Toilets are just holes in the floor above the stables.\nYet despite Lo Manthang's isolation and primitive facilities, the townspeople mounted a meticulous, if homespun, measles campaign.\nThe women who volunteered, organized by the government down to the ward level, delivered invitations to each household by hand, then followed up the night before with a reminder visit, shouting their message like town criers.\nOver the years, they have distributed 2 cent doses of Vitamin A to children, an intervention that cuts child mortality by almost a quarter, studies have shown. They have handed out de-worming tablets that cost a penny and slash infant mortality. They have handed out packets of oral rehydration salts that cost only 6 cents to save the lives of children with diarrhea.\nAnd they have gone door to door to take children to the clinic for immunizations.\nIn a country where the status of women is low, these illiterate mothers say they willingly do a job that pays no salary because it gives them a way to contribute and win respect.\n\"If I didn't tell them about vaccination programs or medicines, they wouldn't know,\" said Doka Gurung, a 30-year-old mother of four who has volunteered for a decade. \"I do help them, and I feel good about that.\"\nBy 8 the morning of the campaign, parents and children were lining up at Lo Manthang's small, rustic clinic. The volunteers covered the eyes of children who howled in fear as health workers approached with needles, then hustled out to fetch the boys and girls who had not shown up.\nNot so many years ago, before routine immunization took hold, measles outbreaks were common. The disease spared no one, not even royalty.\nThe king of Mustang, Jigme Palbar Bista, 73, a direct descendant of the original, 15th-century monarch, offered his own memories of a time before modern medicine arrived.\nHe held court on the top floor of his medieval palace, reached by a steep, narrow wooden staircase. Bearish Tibetan mastiffs with bloodshot eyes paced menacingly, guarding him.\nFingering prayer beads, the king recalled that as a child he had had measles, but survived while many others died. \"I've seen myself, just 10, 15 years ago, three children in one family die within three days,\" he said.\nThe measles campaign in Lo Manthang, a bastion of Tibetan Buddhist culture, concluded this day at The Great Compassion Sakyapa Monastic School.\nThe principal, Wangdi Sangbo, 33, welcomed the vaccinators. He himself had almost died during a measles outbreak when he was 10 years old. \"There were no doctors, no vaccinations,\" he said.\nThe next generation of boys he hoped to protect, he said, with help from the community. They gathered in the school's courtyard, laughing and teasing one another.\nPhuntsok Sangbo, 13, was so scared he hid, but his friends tracked him down and led him back. He squeezed his eyes shut and blew out a breath as the needle went in.\nThe last in line was a bold 16-year-old named Karma Namgyal.\n\"They're going to give you the bigger needle,\" one of his friends taunted him.\nKarma just laughed and stuck out his arm, eager for the life-saving prick.\nThe Disease Highly contagious, measles is spread by coughing and sneezing.

    "text": "Leaving Stony Brook to Follow a Sheik\n2006-04-09T05:00:00.000Z\nCorrection Appended\nSIDNEY CENTER, N.Y. - ONE by one, their sons walked out -- out of Stony Brook University, out of their families' lives -- and moved to this hamlet in the Catskill Mountains over the last two years. The young men told their parents they were following an Islamic spiritual path that led to a charismatic teacher called Shaykh Abdul Kerim al-Kibrisi.\nThe parents of the three men -- Kevin Malley, Erdem Kahyaoglu and Abir Rahman -- say that the shaykh, a Turkish Cypriot whose legal name is Aydogan Fuat, is not a legitimate Islamic cleric at all, but a cult leader who led their sons astray. And they say their sons were recruited on the Stony Brook campus.\nA handful of current Stony Brook students are also among Mr. Fuat's followers, and sometimes spend weekends at his 50-acre farm near Sidney Center, in northwestern Delaware County.\n\"Other parents should know that one day, their kid could be a student at Stony Brook, and the next day he's changed his name to Salih Haqqani and is no longer their son,\" said Jeanne Marie Malley. Her son moved to Sidney Center in January 2005.\nPatrick Calabria, a spokesman for Stony Brook, said Mr. Fuat and his organization, the Osmanli Naks-i'bendi Hakkani Dergahi, had no connection to the university. He said a group called the Ottoman Students Association, which first invited Mr. Fuat to preach on campus in 2004, appeared to be inactive now.\nMr. Calabria said that, based on what the university now knows about Mr. Fuat, \"if he were present today, we would investigate the situation to ensure that no laws were being broken and take whatever action, as appropriate, to protect our students.\"\nThe group professes Sufism, regarded as a moderate and mystical strain of Islam. It operates a dergah -- a meeting place for Sufi Muslims -- in midtown Manhattan, as well as the farm in Sidney Center, where about two dozen followers tend sheep, grow vegetables, worship and study religious teachings.\nOn its Web site, Mr. Fuat's group says that he is a deputy of Grandshaykh Muhammad Nazim, the spiritual leader of the worldwide Naqshbandi-Haqqani Sufi Order. But Abdul Haqq, a spokesman for that order in North America, said he is not.\n\"He has made his own group,\" Mr. Haqq said.\nMr. Haqq added that while \"shaykh\" -- the Turkish equivalent of the Arab word sheik -- is a formal clerical title among Sufis that can be bestowed only by the grandshaykh, the word is also a common informal term of respect.\nStony Brook University has many Muslim students, and the university recognizes the Muslim Students Association, a chapter of a national collegiate group, as an important focus of spiritual life on campus, and provides it with some student-activity money. The group tries to minimize frictions by discouraging its members from identifying themselves by sect, according to the president, Ayman Sawas.\nBy contrast, the Ottoman Students Association was a small group that received no official recognition or support from the university, other than being allowed to hold meetings in a student activity center, according to Mr. Calabria.\nThe group organized an occasional \"Sufi Night,\" a social gathering for students interested in Sufism and the Ottoman Empire. At those meetings, Mr. Fuat's followers invited classmates to hear him at the Manhattan dergah and to visit the farm.\nWhen the group invited Mr. Fuat to speak on campus, \"I thought it was controversial, and other students were against him coming,\" said Sanaa Nadim, the university's Muslim chaplain. \"I try my level best to not let outside influences come to the university. But, at times, I don't have any control over it.\"\nIn an interview at the dergah, Mr. Fuat said the farm was both his home and a spiritual retreat for anyone interested in Sufism. And he said he is not a preacher.\n\"I talk,\" he said. \"People who want to listen can listen. People who want to leave can leave.\"\nThe parents of the three former Stony Brook students said they were angry that their sons had given up their studies or professional aspirations or family ties under Mr. Fuat's influence. Other than Ms. Malley, who is an American-born Roman Catholic, the parents are Muslim immigrants from Turkey and Bangladesh. They accused Mr. Fuat of misinterpreting the Koran.\n\"Islam is not about leaving your family,\" said Ahmet Kahyaoglu, whose son Erdem moved to the farm eight months ago. \"It's about making a strong family.\"\nMr. Fuat said in an interview that, far from telling the three men to isolate themselves, he had encouraged them to finish school and to remain close to their families. But he acknowledged that many of his followers' families object strongly to their involvement in his group.\nDuring a recent visit to his farm, surrounded by nine men and two women, he pointed to one after another of them and described the conflicts they had had with relatives.\n\"His brother, a policeman, threatened to remove him physically,\" Mr. Fuat said, pointing to one man.\nMr. Fuat, 49, is a naturalized United States citizen who once owned a Turkish restaurant in Manhattan. While visiting Turkey in 2001, he was arrested and charged with illegally preaching Sufism in the country, which has elaborate laws regulating religious activity. Human-rights groups protested the arrest. After six months in jail, he was acquitted, and he returned to New York.\nBut that may not be the end of the matter. Mr. Fuat showed a reporter a letter he received from Glenn T. Suddaby, the United States attorney for the Northern District of New York, ordering him to report to Mr. Suddaby's office in Syracuse on April 5, a date that was later postponed to April 19. Mr. Fuat said he got the letter because the Turkish authorities had reopened the 2001 case. In a telephone interview, Mr. Suddaby declined to say what prompted the letter or to otherwise discuss any pending cases.\nMr. Fuat has also attracted some law-enforcement attention in the United States. Several police agencies in Delaware County said they had investigated him and his group at various times; other than issuing one minor summons, they found no wrongdoing and took no action. F.B.I. agents interviewed Mr. Fuat and some of his followers in 2003 but made no arrests; a spokesman for the bureau's Albany office declined to say whether an investigation was open.\nMainstream Muslims disown Mr. Fuat and his group. \"They do not belong to any Naqshbandi order,\" said Nayyar Imam, the president of the Islamic Association of Long Island, whose Selden mosque is attended by many Stony Brook students. \"They have created their own thing.\" Mr. Imam is also a Suffolk County human rights commissioner.\n\"Those kids who join him have no idea what real Islam is,\" Mr. Imam said. \"They follow him because they have nothing to compare with, and they're searching for religion they don't get at home.\"\nStill, William C. Chittick, a Stony Brook professor of Persian literature and an expert on Sufism who had Mr. Malley and Mr. Kahyaoglu as students in his classes, said that prejudice against Sufis was widespread among mainstream Muslims.\nNoting that the parents of the three men \"are very ambitious for their children,\" Professor Chittick speculated that Mr. Fuat's profession of Sufism may play a role in how upset they are: \"One day their kid suddenly announces he's not going to become an engineer or a doctor, but is moving to some farm to pray. So they're outraged and they call it blasphemy.\"\nAbir Rahman, a Stony Brook graduate who quit law school after two semesters to follow Mr. Fuat, moved to a home near the farm last year. He said his parents are not devout Muslims, but he is.\n\"They forget that Islam came to my country through Sufi ways,\" Mr. Rahman said, referring to Bangladesh, where he was born.\nErdem Kahyaoglu said in a telephone interview that Ms. Nadim, the Stony Brook chaplain, was \"a huge factor\" in his decision to follow Mr. Fuat. But Ms. Nadim said she only encouraged him to study Naqshbandi Sufism. \"In my heart of hearts, I would not have told him to do what he did,\" she said.\nMr. Fuat said his followers try to assimilate into the rural community around Sidney Center; two, including Mr. Malley, have joined the local volunteer fire department.\n\"People don't want us to live here, but we have no intention of leaving,\" he said. \"This is our home and our place of worship. We are accepting the laws and the government. We are not breaking any laws.\"\nFormer followers dispute Mr. Fuat's benign description of his group's ways, saying that his teaching conflicts with Islam, that he takes financial advantage of his followers and that he drives wedges between them and their families.\nBridget Gilmore, who now lives in Sidney, a nearby village, said she joined Mr. Fuat's group three years ago with her husband, Hans Hass. She left after a year with the couple's three children, but her husband remained in the group; they are now divorcing.\nMs. Gilmore said Mr. Fuat discourages his followers from having any relationship other than with him. \"I felt I no longer had a husband, because he became obsessed with being around the shaykh,\" she said.\nAsked about family conflicts among Mr. Fuat's followers, Mr. Hass looked first at Mr. Fuat before responding. \"If our intention is good, it will work to our benefit in the end,\" he said.\nMr. Fuat said the women at the center are assigned traditional Muslim roles, although Mr. Fuat's wife, Meryem Brawley, is a consultant with I.B.M.\nClint Henderson, who followed Mr. Fuat for 15 years, said he and his wife broke away three years ago because Mr. Fuat's group had become \"a full-blown cult.\"\n\"I gave every last dollar I could possibly give\" Mr. Henderson said, adding that, like other followers, he gave $100 a week for years. \"But it got so ludicrous that I could not kiss his hand without putting a $20 bill into it.\"\nMr. Fuat said he does not ask his followers for money. Rather, he said, they sometimes contribute voluntarily to a fund for construction of a new masjid -- a mosque and study center -- at the farm.\nMr. Henderson said he had seen many breaks between followers and their families. \"He exploits that place where a young man is breaking with his father or doesn't have a father, and exploits a need during that transitional point in his life,\" Mr. Henderson said.\nMr. Fuat confirmed that many of his followers were young men from broken or troubled homes, but he denied trying to break up anyone's family.\nMainstream Muslim leaders like Faroque Ahmad Khan, chairman of the Islamic Center of Long Island in Westbury, said that cutting ties to one's family is a grave sin. \"This is not right,\" Mr. Khan said. \"This is not Islam.\"\nHoping to pry their sons loose from Mr. Fuat's group, the parents of the three men sought help from lawyers, but were told they had no recourse because their sons were of legal age.\nAmong the lawyers contacted was Robert J. Gaffney, the former Suffolk County executive and a former federal agent. He said Mr. Fuat's group seemed to be a typical cult, preying on vulnerable young people yearning for spirituality, and the fact that it happened to espouse Muslim beliefs had little relevance.\n\"We could be talking about Buddhism, or Hinduism, or Christianity,\" he said. \"This is far more like the Reverend Moon than Al Qaeda.\"\nIn interviews, neighbors of the farm in Sidney Center, where Mr. Fuat first arrived in 2002, expressed mixed views about him and his followers. \"Some people wave to them,\" said Steve Monosson, who lives up the road. \"Others think there's terror on their doorstep, and that's as far as they can think it through.\"\nNoting that many of Mr. Fuat's followers are of Turkish or Middle Eastern descent and wear traditional clothing, Mr. Monosson recalled driving by the farm one day and seeing a blonde woman standing at the farm entrance. \"She looked despondent,\" he said. \"And she didn't look like she belonged there.\"\nThe woman was Ms. Malley.\n\"My son told me I would understand in another life,\" she said in a telephone interview in February. \"I will never understand.\"\nOn a recent Friday night, 6 women and 22 men attended services at the group's Manhattan dergah. Many of the men wore dark green turbans over skullcaps, long maroon vests, baggy trousers and black leather slippers. Mr. Fuat spoke about self-discipline, absolute devotion and skepticism toward education.\n\"There is no knowledge today,\" he said, one hand pulling on his long gray beard. \"Lots of books. Lots of educated people. But education is getting people more miserable.\"\nWhen he was finished speaking, the lights were turned off and the men loudly chanted prayers for more than an hour. The smell of sweat mingled with incense as they rocked back and forth, seeking the hypnotic state that Sufism equates with spirituality purity.\nAfterward, several men, including Erdem Kahyaoglu, rushed to take Mr. Fuat food and water drawn from the farm's well, helped him out of his cloak and kissed his hand.\nMr. Fuat's teaching against education strikes Ms. Nadim, the Stony Brook Muslim chaplain, as strange. She said that Islam favors education and that Naqshbandi Sufis are particularly known as intellectuals. The global leader of the order, Grandshaykh Muhammad Nazim, is a chemical engineer, she said.\n\"How can you turn people away from earthly knowledge that strengthens them?\" Ms. Nadim said. \"I think this is madness.\"\nBut Abir Rahman, one of Mr. Fuat's followers, said in an interview that he quit law school after Mr. Fuat advised him that paying interest on a loan, even a student loan, would violate Islamic teaching. He said he now works in a mall as a salesclerk.\nHis father, Abdur Rahman, said Mr. Fuat \"brainwashed\" his son.\n\"He said Abir would be thrown into hell in the next world if he pays interest, but that's ridiculous,\" the elder Mr. Rahman said. \"Muslims have mortgages and car loans like everyone else. This shaykh does not want his fellows to become educated, because they will understand what he is, and maybe they will leave him.\"\nMr. Fuat acknowledged telling his followers that paying interest was sinful, but he denied brainwashing anyone. He said that the parents who accuse him of that simply do not understand the stability and peace that his followers find in Sufi beliefs and practices.\nSeveral parents said they had visited the farm over the past two years, hoping to persuade their sons to leave, without success. Quite the opposite, in fact: in March, Mr. Malley obtained a court order of protection barring his mother from the farm. Asked whether he was happy in Sidney Center, Mr. Malley hesitated and looked at Mr. Fuat. \"Yes, definitely,\" he said after a moment. \"Happiness is something I never really understood until now.\"\nLennon Stravato, a friend and classmate of Mr. Malley and Mr. Kahyaoglu at Stony Brook, said he visited the farm at the urging of his friends' parents, but came away with no evidence that anything was seriously amiss there.\n\"The great conflict is, it's hard to say what's religion and what isn't, and you can't read a man's mind to say what his intentions are,\" Mr. Stravato said. \"The shaykh doesn't seem to be well read, not grounded in the Koran, often misquotes it and shows a lack of knowledge. But living an unconventional life is not evidence of mind control.\"\n\"Anyway, they're grown-ups,\" he added. \"What can anyone do?\"\nLong Island Correction: April 30, 2006, Sunday An article April 9 about a group of people, some of them former Stony Brook students, who profess Sufi Muslim beliefs and live on a farm in Delaware County, N.Y., referred imprecisely to the three children of Bridget Gilmore, a former member of the group. Her husband, Hans Hass, who is still a member, is the father of two of the children, not all three; the oldest is from an earlier relationship of Ms. Gilmore's.",

    "text": "Mothers of Nepal Vanquish a Killer of Children\n2006-04-30T05:00:00.000Z\nLO MANTHANG, Nepal - As dusk descended on this medieval walled city and its dirt lanes filled with horses cantering home from the mountains, the piercing voice of a woman could be heard over the pounding hooves.\n\"Come for the measles vaccination tomorrow!\" Deki Gurung shouted to a neighbor.\n\"I know, I know, I got the invitation,\" the neighbor replied with a roll of her eyes as she peered over her balcony.\nAcross the impoverished kingdom of Nepal, 50,000 mothers like Mrs. Gurung, most of them illiterate, are foot soldiers in one of the great unfolding public health triumphs of modern times: the global push to slash the number of children who die from complications of measles.\nNepal's first national measles vaccination campaign last year cut by 90 percent the country's measles-related deaths, usually about 5,000 per year, the United Nations Children's Fund estimates.\nBut remarkable as it is, that tremendous success is overshadowed by the grievous toll measles continues to take in neighboring India. Experts estimate that more than 100,000 children a year still die there from complications of measles for want of a 15 cent vaccine.\nThe contrast between the nations highlights both the extraordinary promise of measles control, and the tragedy of its unfulfilled potential.\nNepal's campaign shows that quick, deep inroads can be made against measles with the proper financing and national will, as well as a tested strategy for winning public trust of vaccines.\n\"Vaccinating children against measles is the greatest return on investment for child health that we have,\" said Dr. Mark Grabowsky, who for five years was the adviser to the Red Cross for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"It's the low-hanging fruit.\"\nStill, measles kills 450,000 children worldwide each year. India, which has more measles-related deaths than any other country, has not made it a national priority in the way Nepal, Bangladesh and countries across Africa have. It has instead focused on its drive to eradicate polio, building a stronger rural health care system and bolstering immunization generally, in hopes of protecting children from other diseases.\nTackling a Disease\nIndia's choice highlights a fierce but little noticed debate among international public health experts: whether it is better to attack a single disease with big campaigns or instead make long-term investments to improve public health systems.\nIndeed, the crux of measles control is strong routine immunization, which is best provided by a solidly run health care system.\nThe vaccine is 85-to-90-percent effective in the first year of life. But the airborne measles virus is so contagious that a second vaccination, given either routinely or in a mass campaign, is often needed. It is that second dose that India does not yet provide all its children.\nSuch second-dose campaigns, reaching into the world's most remote corners, have saved a million children since 1999, the World Health Organization says.\nThe strategy, first used in Latin America in 1994, eliminated measles from the Western Hemisphere by 2002. In Africa, the approach has more than halved measles-related deaths in just four years. Measles weakens children's immune systems, making them vulnerable to fatal complications from diarrhea, pneumonia and malnutrition.\nNepal used the same plan, but several other things went right here. Not only has Nepal's measles effort been unburdened by competition from polio, which was wiped out six years ago, but also for more than a decade Nepal has used a highly organized network of volunteer mothers to deliver simple health services in the lanes around their homes.\nLocal human rights workers, part of a broad alliance of civic groups supporting the campaign, also played a critical role. They mediated disputes between government officials and Maoist rebels who have led a decade-long insurrection. \"We have taken this campaign as an issue of national prestige,\" said Dr. Yasho Pradhan, Nepal's director of child health.\nNepal's crash campaign reduced the number of outbreaks to just one last year from 195 in 2004, Unicef reported. Vaccination teams combed the slums of Katmandu and trekked through treacherous mountain passes to reach every last child, 9 months to 14 years old.\n\"It was amazingly effective,\" said Dr. Suomi Sakai, the Unicef representative in Nepal.\nDisparate Approaches\nIn the jangling, chaotic lanes of places like Ghaziabad, just an hour's drive from the Indian capital, New Delhi, people call measles \"Mata,\" or mother, for the Hindu deity associated with the disease. The characteristic red rash is seen as a visitation of the goddess.\nOne morning last year, pushcart vendors, rickshaw drivers and laborers whose children had rashes or were recovering from them lined up in a small, dingy temple, tucked behind a candy shop.\nThe swami, Grishm Giri, 82, his long white beard hanging halfway down his stained tunic, explained that last year had brought twice the usual number of measles cases. He waved a staff of peacock feathers over each child and chanted prayers, collecting about 12 cents from each family.\nHis assistant, Niraj Giri, a middle-aged man in a saffron-colored shirt, measured the distance from the children's navels to their nipples with a string. \"We try to find out if the center of the navel is in the right place,\" the assistant said. \"If it is not, we correct it.\" He explained that this displacement of the center is the real cause of disease, a problem that can be fixed through the nerves by hitting the bottoms of a person's feet.\nAmong those waiting for help was Ram Pukar, a rickshaw driver, holding his 6-year-old daughter, Sujita, who was so sick her head lolled from side to side. Her long black hair hung like a matted screen across her face.\nMr. Pukar's wife, Lalita Devi, cradled their 18-month-old son, Bisnu, also limp in her arms. Both children had a rash. Mr. Pukar, who is illiterate, said Sujita and Bisnu had been given polio drops many times, but had never been vaccinated for measles.\nThe asymmetry in resources to tackle polio and measles in this country is striking.\nIndia, home to one-sixth of the world's population, spent $216 million last year in its last-ditch effort to eradicate polio, which paralyzed 66 children in 2005. There was no comparable war chest for a measles drive.\nThe Measles Partnership, a coalition that includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, the Red Cross, the W.H.O. and Unicef, has led the drive globally. Last year, the partnership asked the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, an umbrella group of donor countries and organizations, for $479 million to accelerate measles campaigns around the world, with the biggest chunk of the money for India.\nThe alliance has committed only $147 million, funds available only because Britain, France and other countries agreed to raise the money on the bond markets.\nIn India, 5-year-olds in the northern states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar may well have been immunized against polio more than 20 times, while the overwhelming majority have never once been vaccinated for measles.\nFrom 1998 to 2003, surveys found that the proportion of children fully immunized against measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus and other diseases actually declined in three-quarters of the Indian districts for which there was data.\nAn expert assessment sponsored by the Indian government pointed to a variety of culprits, among them poor supervision, inadequate training, vaccine shortages and the emphasis given to polio.\nDr. Jay Wenger, who manages the national polio surveillance project for the W.H.O., disputed the idea that the polio push is to blame for problems in routine immunization, which often reflect deeper problems of misgovernance.\n\"Clearly, a lot of time is being spent on polio,\" Dr. Wenger said. \"It would be silly to say it's not.\" Nonetheless, there is still plenty of time to do routine immunization for measles, he said.\nBut Indian managers in the field say their workers, already stretched thin, have too little time for other tasks because large parts of the year are devoted to polio. \"The big casualty is the routine immunization,\" said Dr. Sudha Yadav, who works at a small hospital in the city of Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh.\nFor now, India is hoping to reduce measles deaths by strengthening rural health care and routine immunization, developing a cadre of 250,000 village women dedicated, as in Nepal, to improving services.\nDr. Anbumani Ramadoss, India's health minister, said in a recent interview that he hopes India can turn to measles soon.\nJulian Lob-Levyt, executive secretary of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, defends India's approach. \"In the long term, building a stronger basic health system will benefit many more people of all ages in all parts of societies,\" he said.\nBut for a country like India, forgoing measles campaigns will have a high price in deaths, particularly in states like Uttar Pradesh. Where state governments fail to deliver basic public health services, people often rely on traditional practices, like those at the temple in Ghaziabad.\nAfter an outbreak in Ghaziabad last year, Dr. M. P. Singh, the chief medical officer in the district, conceded that many children had not been immunized for measles. \"Before this outbreak, measles shots weren't given,\" he said.\nTwo of the confirmed deaths in Ghaziabad were the sons of a laborer, Kishore Lal. \"The child was in my lap when he breathed his last,\" Mr. Lal said, tears spilling down his gaunt cheeks as he described the death of Ramjanak, 5, last April. Amit, the other dead son, was 3.\nA month after Amit's death, Mr. Lal and his wife squatted listlessly in front of their small hut. \"We don't feel like working,\" he said. \"We don't feel like eating.\"\nIn a nearby lane, Tuntun Paswan, 32, and his wife, Ramdhana Devi, 28, also mourned the death of their son, Karan, 2. He passed away in the middle of the night in his mother's arms.\nThey buried the toddler, with his rattle and plastic bat, by the Hindon River.\nA Nation's Dedication\nWhile the Indian parents were still immobilized by grief, three porters were huffing and puffing through the mountains of Nepal, each hauling 100 pounds of vaccines and other supplies. They scaled narrow, rocky trails that snaked along the deepest gorge on earth.\nWinds roared with oceanic force, curling around them like giant waves. The shifting boxes of supplies, held in place by straps around the men's foreheads, scraped the skin on their backs.\nIt was only through extraordinary efforts like these last summer that the last Nepalese children to be vaccinated were reached in the nearly inaccessible Upper Mustang region. Similar, if less dramatic, scenes played out around the country as a carefully choreographed measles campaign unfolded over nine months.\nOutsiders who came for the campaign, including health workers and monitors from Unicef, journeyed over desolate mountains, some rising more than 13,000 feet, into a time before cellphones and televisions.\nWhen they finally crested the last bone-colored peak, the walled town of Lo Manthang lay before them. Some 600 years ago, this small kingdom sat astride a major trans-Himalayan trading route. Conditions are still medieval. Horses and cows live on the first floor of people's homes. Toilets are just holes in the floor above the stables.\nYet despite Lo Manthang's isolation and primitive facilities, the townspeople mounted a meticulous, if homespun, measles campaign.\nThe women who volunteered, organized by the government down to the ward level, delivered invitations to each household by hand, then followed up the night before with a reminder visit, shouting their message like town criers.\nOver the years, they have distributed 2 cent doses of Vitamin A to children, an intervention that cuts child mortality by almost a quarter, studies have shown. They have handed out de-worming tablets that cost a penny and slash infant mortality. They have handed out packets of oral rehydration salts that cost only 6 cents to save the lives of children with diarrhea.\nAnd they have gone door to door to take children to the clinic for immunizations.\nIn a country where the status of women is low, these illiterate mothers say they willingly do a job that pays no salary because it gives them a way to contribute and win respect.\n\"If I didn't tell them about vaccination programs or medicines, they wouldn't know,\" said Doka Gurung, a 30-year-old mother of four who has volunteered for a decade. \"I do help them, and I feel good about that.\"\nBy 8 the morning of the campaign, parents and children were lining up at Lo Manthang's small, rustic clinic. The volunteers covered the eyes of children who howled in fear as health workers approached with needles, then hustled out to fetch the boys and girls who had not shown up.\nNot so many years ago, before routine immunization took hold, measles outbreaks were common. The disease spared no one, not even royalty.\nThe king of Mustang, Jigme Palbar Bista, 73, a direct descendant of the original, 15th-century monarch, offered his own memories of a time before modern medicine arrived.\nHe held court on the top floor of his medieval palace, reached by a steep, narrow wooden staircase. Bearish Tibetan mastiffs with bloodshot eyes paced menacingly, guarding him.\nFingering prayer beads, the king recalled that as a child he had had measles, but survived while many others died. \"I've seen myself, just 10, 15 years ago, three children in one family die within three days,\" he said.\nThe measles campaign in Lo Manthang, a bastion of Tibetan Buddhist culture, concluded this day at The Great Compassion Sakyapa Monastic School.\nThe principal, Wangdi Sangbo, 33, welcomed the vaccinators. He himself had almost died during a measles outbreak when he was 10 years old. \"There were no doctors, no vaccinations,\" he said.\nThe next generation of boys he hoped to protect, he said, with help from the community. They gathered in the school's courtyard, laughing and teasing one another.\nPhuntsok Sangbo, 13, was so scared he hid, but his friends tracked him down and led him back. He squeezed his eyes shut and blew out a breath as the needle went in.\nThe last in line was a bold 16-year-old named Karma Namgyal.\n\"They're going to give you the bigger needle,\" one of his friends taunted him.\nKarma just laughed and stuck out his arm, eager for the life-saving prick.\nThe Disease Highly contagious, measles is spread by coughing and sneezing. Symptoms include high fever, cough and a bodywide rash. Complications include pneumonia, encephalitis and blindness. It is the leading cause of blindness among children in Africa and kills more than 450,000 children each year worldwide.\nOn the Brink\nThis is the last article in a series about five diseases -- polio, guinea worm, blinding trachoma, lymphatic filariasis and measles -- that are extinct in the developed world but stubbornly persistent in some poor nations.\nThe articles will remain online, with multimedia presentations, including an audio slide show with Celia W. Dugger, and the names and addresses of organizations that accept donations to help combat these diseases, at nytimes.com/health.",

    "text": "India develops its industrial strength - Business - International Herald Tribune\n2006-08-31T05:00:00.000Z\nPUNE, India \u2014 India's economic advancement no longer rests on telephone call centers and computer programmers.\nAmong villages with thatch-roofed huts and dirt roads on the outskirts of this city in west-central India, John Deere and LG have recently built factories turning out tractors and color television sets for sale in India and for export to the United States.\nIn Hazira, in northwestern India, where some residents still rely on camels as beasts of burden, Essar Group is making steel to be used for ventilation shafts in Philadelphia, high-rise structural beams in Chicago and car engine mountings in Detroit.\nFor decades, India had followed a very different route to economic development than Japan, South Korea or China. While its Asian rivals placed bets on manufacturing and exports, India focused on its domestic economy and grew more slowly with an emphasis on services.\nBut all that is starting to change.\nIndia's annual growth in manufacturing output, at 9 percent and accelerating, is close to catching growth in services, at 10 percent. Exports of manufactured goods to the United States are now rising faster in percentage terms than China's, although from a much smaller base. More than two-thirds of foreign investment in the past year has gone into manufacturing in India, not services.\n\"Saying we are a back office and China is a factory is a backhanded compliment,\" said India's minister of commerce and industry, Kamal Nath. \"It's not really correct.\"\nIn interviews at 18 Indian factories and other businesses in 10 cities and villages scattered across the nation, the picture that emerges is of a country that is being driven by advances in manufacturing to a much brisker pace of economic growth.\nA prime reason India is developing into the world's next big industrial power is that a number of global manufacturers are already looking ahead to a serious demographic crunch in China. Because of China's \"one child\" policy, family sizes have been shrinking since the 1980s, so fewer young people will be available soon for factory labor.\nIndia is not expected to pass China in population until 2030. But India will have more workers ages 20 to 24 by 2013; the International Labor Organization predicts that by 2020, India will have 116 million workers in this age bracket, compared with 94 million in China.\nIndia's young population will also make it a growing market for years to come, while the engineering and English skills of its elite will make it competitive across a wide range of industries.\nSo even though India remains a difficult place to do business - its roads are poor and power is often scarce - several multinationals have been placing big bets on India this year in hopes of taking advantage of this shifting global dynamic.\nGeneral Motors and Motorola are preparing to build plants in western and southern India. Posco, the South Korean steel maker, and Mittal Steel, the Dutch-based conglomerate, have each announced plans to erect giant mills in eastern India, where the Indian company Reliance will soon construct one of the world's largest coal-fired power plants.\nAnd they are finding India's labor force well suited to their goals. When LG wanted to fill 458 assembly line jobs at its factory here last year to make appliances at a starting wage of $90 a month, it required that each applicant have at least 15 years of education, which is usually high school plus a technical college.\nSeeking a young work force, the company decided that no more than 1 percent of the workers could have had any prior work experience. Despite the limitation, 55,000 young people met its criteria.\n\"In the villages there is little income,\" Siddu Matheapattu, 24, said in between applying sealant to refrigerator frames. \"Here I can earn more.\"\nBy contrast, cities in the southeastern Chinese province of Guangdong raised monthly minimum wages this summer by 18 percent to between $70 and $100 a month after factories reported having one million more jobs than workers to fill them. Factories elsewhere in China face fewer labor shortages, but they also are being pressured to raise wages.\nAs India has opened up its economy, output has gradually accelerated to a growth rate of 8 percent a year, feeding a national euphoria and a few hopes of someday even beating China's annual growth of more than 10 percent.\nPlenty of obstacles remain, however, notably India's weak infrastructure. China invests seven dollars on roads, ports, electricity and other backbones of a modern economy for every dollar spent by India - and it shows. Ports here are struggling to handle exports, blackouts are frequent and dirt roads are common even in Bangalore, the center of the country's computer programming industry.\nPervasive corruption has slowed many efforts to fix these problems. India's labor laws, little changed since independence in 1947, also continue to discourage companies from hiring workers because it is difficult to lay off employees even in a downturn.\nStill, a new optimism prevails in India, bordering at times on euphoria.\n\"The Chinese are very good at copying things, but Indians believe in quality work - we believe in meeting pollution norms,\" said S.S. Pathania, the assistant general manager of the Hero Honda motorcycle factory in Gurgaon. \"I think India will pass China very soon.\"\nNext to a gray tidal estuary, the scale of Essar Group's steel-making and power generation complex in Hazira is already impressive. Essar has its own port to bring in iron ore, its own large, gas-fired power plant for electricity and a steel mill. But the complex is just starting to grow. Essar is quintupling steel production and pushing forward a sevenfold increase in power generation, most of it for sale to a national grid desperately short of electricity.\nGrowth on that scale, especially in industries like steel and power but also in areas like car parts and household appliances, is what India has long lacked. Industrial production accounts for only a fifth of India's economic output, compared with two-fifths of China's.\nUntil recently, legislation effectively barred companies with over 100 people from competing in many of industries. The laws were intended to protect tiny businesses in villages, often employing women and minorities; high tariffs were placed on imports as well.\nOne result was hundreds of thousands of businesses too small to be competitive; India lags behind even Bangladesh in clothing exports. The Indian government has responded by narrowing the list of protected industries to 326 categories from 20,000 and has lowered tariffs.\nComparing factories in India to their competitors in China, many of the Indian factories are smaller but some appear more efficient.\nIndia's stronger financial system demands higher interest rates than China's state-owned banks, making it costlier to finance the small mountains of components awaiting assembly that are often seen in Chinese factories. The Confederation of Indian Industry, a trade group, has also successfully pushed companies to adopt the latest Japanese lean manufacturing techniques.\nThe drawback is that the nation's manufacturing boom, built on higher- quality goods made under more modern conditions than in China, is not likely to create as many factory jobs as India needs. The Essar steel mill, for example, has been replacing old, labor-intensive equipment with more modern gear.\n\"We were having it all done manually, but because the customers demand very high quality, we have to do it automatically,\" Rajesh Pandita, an Essar manager, yelled over the roar of a machine that was stretching a coil of steel the size of a minivan through rollers until it was little thicker than plastic kitchen wrap.\nThe Whirlpool factory in Pune uses machines, not people, to fold the steel exteriors of refrigerators together. It has some of the highest productivity per worker of any Whirlpool factory, with just 208 line workers producing up to 33,000 refrigerators a month.\nStill, labor laws discourage flexibility. They bar companies from allowing manufacturing workers to put in more than 54 hours of overtime in a three- month period even if the workers want to earn extra money. The legislation requires double wages and an equal number of hours of paid vacation later to make up for overtime.\n\"Companies think twice, 10 times before they hire new people,\" said Sunil Kant Munjal, chairman of Hero Group, one of the world's largest manufacturers of inexpensive motorcycles.\nHero in Gurgaon, on the southern outskirts of New Delhi, and its archrival, Lifan Group in Chongqing, China, produce comparable motorcycles but the similarity ends there. Hero markets heavily to the Indian market, protected from foreign competition by high tariffs, while China's Lifan emphasizes exports.\nWith scant ventilation, Lifan's factories are filled with diesel exhaust as workers test engines and ride finished bikes at breakneck speed out the doors, zigzagging past co-workers. Hero's factory in Gurgaon, where Honda holds a minority stake, has far better safety standards and excellent ventilation.\nThe Lifan factory pays less than $100 per month. The Hero factory, which is heavily unionized, pays $150 a month plus bonuses of up to $370 per month; nearly half the workers earn the top bonus, said Pathania, the assistant general manager .\nWhile Lifan's labor force is quiescent, would-be organizers of independent labor unions face long prison terms or worse in China. Hero's workers staged a successful nonviolent protest last year to call for more contract workers to be eligible for the bonuses as well.\nDespite such obstacles, India's manufacturing sector appears poised for further growth. In a country where the national symbol has shifted from government bureaucrats at aging desks to call center operators in cubicles, the next icon looks like it will be the laptop- toting engineer on a factory floor.\n\"The old philosophy was 'I should work in an office, come in at 10 and leave at 4,'\" said Nitin Kulkarni, 35, an engineer at the Hazira steel mill. But in recent years, he added, \"there has been a revolution.\"\nTomorrow: Obstacles to growth.",

The Yanks don't stand a chance. With his irresistibly mannered performance as a laconic doctor, Mr. Nighy mops the floor with Ms. Moore. Actually, he mops the floor with Mr. Hare's play (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called \"That 80s Show,\" this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\nOff Broadway\n'ALL TOO HUMAN' Henry Miller's one-man show about Clarence Darrow is far from scintillating theater, but it's relevant (1:35). 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates)\n'THE AMERICAN PILOT' The fate of an injured American soldier hangs in the balance when his plane crashes in territory held by rebels fighting a regime backed by the United States. David Greig's play strives for the topical and the universal, but mostly gets hold of the generic (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club's City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)\n'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing, offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Neil Genzlinger)\n'THE ATHEIST' Chris Pine stars in Ronan Noone's generally compelling if not always credible one-man drama about a reporter who casually ruins lives trying to make his reputation with a big story (1:30). Center Stage, 48 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)\n'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). The Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, ( 212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore)\n*'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)\n'DAI (ENOUGH)' Iris Bahr's unnerving one-woman show doesn't have much to add to the Middle East debate, but it sure leaves a lasting impression. Ms. Bahr plays an assortment of characters who have the misfortune of being in a Tel Aviv cafe that is about to be visited by the havoc common to such establishments. The attack is rendered in jarring fashion, repeatedly; you watch the play on pins and needles, waiting for the next burst. Gimmicky? Sure. But viscerally effective. Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Genzlinger)\n'DARK MATTERS' Elizabeth Marvel plays a rural housewife who may be consorting with extraterrestrials in Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa's risible new drama about space critters bent on beginning a new race. Pure hokum (2:00). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444). (Isherwood)\n'ESOTERICA' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)\n'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next \"Rocky Horror Show.\" To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00) New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)\n'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)\n* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, \"everything old is old again\" (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)\n'HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD AND FIND TRUE LOVE IN 90 MINUTES' This refreshing musical, born of the Fringe Festival, about a bookstore clerk, a slacker, a diplomat and a terrorist, has witty songs, wacky performances and an untethered sense of fun (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)\n'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)\n* 'KAOS' Martha Clarke's clever compaction of a lengthy 1984 film of the same title, by the Taviani Brothers, is based on short stories by Luigi Pirandello, set at the turn of the last century in his native Sicily. A beguiling if deadly serious blend of text, dance and music, adeptly performed and made more flavorful, if more exotic, by Ms. Clarke's decision to have the entire text spoken in Italian (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (John Rockwell)\n'THE MILLINER' Suzanne Glass's delicate play tells of a Jewish hat-maker who, after fleeing Germany and his beloved mother and business just before World War II, longs to return to Berlin. A vixenish cabaret singer is among the things beckoning him back. The lovely hats, both worn and used as scenery, will make the bare heads of 2006 long for the old days (2:30). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger)\n'MY NAME IS RACHEL CORRIE' A small, intense and loudly heralded one-woman drama that tells the true story of its title character, a pro-Palestinian activist killed in the Gaza strip by an Israeli Army bulldozer. Yet for all the political and emotional baggage carried by this production, adapted from Ms. Corrie's writings and starring Megan Dodds, it often feels dramatically flat, even listless (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)\n'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)\n'AN OAK TREE' Tim Crouch plays a hypnotist in this elusive puzzle of a play about grief and the power of suggestion (1:05). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)\n'POST MORTEM' A grievance list of a comedy by the indefatigable A. R. Gurney, set in the near future, about the unearthing of a world-shaking play called \"Post Mortem\" by A. R. Gurney. Jim Simpson directs this likable grab bag of insider jokes, polemical satire and cosmic lamentation (1:30). The Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)\n'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quip-meisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)\n'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this old comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). The SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger)\n'SCHOOL FOR WIVES' The Pearl Theater Company's production of Moli\u00e8re's satire about one misguided man's expectations of women is pleasant, occasionally quite funny and definitely on the side of common sense (1:55). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Gates)\n* 'STRIKING 12' A minimalist musical about an odd but rewarding New Year's Eve in the life of a guy who hates New Year's Eve. Performed by the indie pop band Groovelily, it's fresh and funny, and features a standout pop score (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)\n'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER' As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)\n'THE TIMEKEEPERS' Dan Clancy's play, which throws a Jewish artisan and a gay hustler together in a concentration camp, transcends standard Holocaust psychodrama on the strength of its characterizations and definitive performances by Seth Barrish and Eric Paeper (1:35). Barrow Group Theater, 312 West 36th Street, third floor, (212) 760-2615. (Rob Kendt)\n'25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)\n'TWO TRAINS RUNNING' Directed by Lou Bellamy, a rough-edged revival of August Wilson's 1992 play about the stark economics of life and death for African-Americans, set in a dying diner in Pittsburgh in the late 1960s. The pace drags in this production, but it remains a bracing reminder of Mr. Wilson's singular talent for making cold, hard numbers sing hot, molten blues (3:40). Signature Theater at Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)\nOff Off Broadway\n'THE FORTUNE TELLER' This morality tale for grown-ups is told through marvelously grotesque puppets and a cast, evoking Edward Gorey and Tim Burton. Written by Erik Sanko, it is an allegory of the Seven Deadly Sins, a lovely thing to look upon and listen to (the dark, brooding music is by Mr. Sanko and Danny Elfman), but for all its macabre grisliness, it needs more drama. The detailed puppets are hard to read even in this small theater, and not all of the vignettes live up to the show's initial promise. Still, there's a lot to like, starting with the narrator: an alligator named Silas Leech, voiced in the plummy tones of the musician and actor Gavin Friday (1:00). Here Arts Center, 145 Sixth Avenue, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101. (Anne Midgette)\n'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny. (1:00) Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)\nSpectacles\n'BIG APPLE CIRCUS' One terrific show (2:15). Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500 or (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)\n'RADIO CITY CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR' Mingles tradition and novelty to a festive fare-thee-well (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-1000. (Van Gelder)\nLong-Running Shows\n'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30).

(Brantley)\nLast Chance\n'BHUTAN' Daisy Foote's drama may not be working the freshest territory -- dead-end lives in a small town -- but it sure is well told and well acted. A widow and her two teenagers are struggling financially and feeling dislocated by their town's changing social alignments; Sarah Lord is especially good as the daughter whose fascination with a neighbor's trip to Bhutan gives the play its title and overarching metaphor (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)\n'DURANGO' In Julia Cho's tender-hearted comedy-drama, a Korean-American family takes to the road with a trunk full of emotional baggage in tow. The narrative mostly runs in familiar grooves, but Ms. Cho has a clear, honest voice, and Chay Yew's production sets it off elegantly (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)\n'HEARTBREAK HOUSE' A ripping revival of Shaw's comedy about the English gentry waltzing toward the abyss as the shadow of World War I looms. Philip Bosco, as the admirably sane madman Captain Shotover, and Swoosie Kurtz, as his swaggeringly romantic daughter, lead the superb cast, under the sharp direction of Robin Lefevre. Nearly a century after its composition, the play still sparkles with wit and sends a shiver down the spine too (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)\n'THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE' A slow, airless revival of Jay Presson Allen's 1966 play (adapted from Muriel Spark's novel) about a dangerous Scottish schoolteacher, directed by Scott Elliott and starring the wonderful (but miscast) Cynthia Nixon, who seems much too sane and centered as the deluded Miss Brody. (2:40). The Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Brantley)\n'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)\n'THE WHORE FROM OHIO' Hanoch Levin's black comedy about a 70-year-old beggar who hires a prostitute is vulgar but stylish, and at times an emotional revelation (1:30). La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 475-7710; closing on Sunday. (Gates)\nMovies\nRatings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.\n* 'THE AURA' (No rating, 138 minutes, in Spanish) A heist, a case of mistaken identity and a lonely, epileptic taxidermist are at the heart of this melancholy, deeply satisfying noir exercise, the second and last feature directed by the Argentine filmmaker Fabi\u00e1n Bielinsky, who died in June. (A. O. Scott)\n* 'BERGMAN ISLAND' (No rating, 101 minutes total running time, in Swedish and English) This documentary portrait of the great Swedish director, now 88 and living on the desolate Baltic Island of Faro, is extraordinarily revealing. In this extended interview, interwoven with fragments from his pictures, he recalls his life and loves and addresses his fear of death. The film underscores the intensely autobiographical nature of his art. (Stephen Holden)\n'BOBBY' (R, 111 minutes) Emilio Estevez's picture, which follows a score of characters through the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, is full of noble ambition. The day in question ended with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, an event that hovers over the movie, even though Kennedy himself is visible only in archival clips. A huge cast (including Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Lindsay Lohan and Mr. Estevez) labors to inject a collection of melodramatic anecdotes with portent and significance, but the individual parts of the film tend to be either overdone or vague and slight. (Scott)\n* 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN,' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Manohla Dargis)\n'CASINO ROYALE' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The latest James Bond vehicle finds the British spy leaner, meaner and now played by an attractive piece of blond rough named Daniel Craig. Zap, pow, ka-ching! (Dargis)\n'COME EARLY MORNING' (R, 97 minutes) Ashley Judd returns to the Southern, working-class milieu of her first screen triumph, \"Ruby in Paradise,\" to deliver her most natural screen performance since that film pushed her toward stardom in 1993. Aside from pungent local color, there's not much surrounding this portrait of an embittered barfly floundering through a succession of one-night stands. (Holden)\n* 'DAYS OF GLORY' (R, 120 minutes, in French) Rachid Bouchareb's tale of North African soldiers fighting to free their French colonial masters from German Occupation during World War II is a potent combat picture, and also a searching and complex political drama. (Scott)\n'DECK THE HALLS' (PG, 95 minutes) In the holiday tradition of stale fruitcake, ugly snowflake sweaters and food poisoning comes this piece of junk, in which Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito compete to see who can annoy the audience more. (Scott)\n'DHOOM 2' (No rating, 151 minutes, in Hindi) A slick and satisfying example of the new, thoroughly modern Bollywood, this cops-and-robbers tale is animated by old-fashioned star power. Hrithik Roshan plays the \"smartest and coolest thief alive,\" and Aishwarya Rai is the small-time crook who loves him. (Rachel Saltz)\n* 'FAST FOOD NATION' (R, 106 minutes) Richard Linklater has turned Eric Schlosser's journalistic expos\u00e9 of the American industrial food system into a thoughtful, occasionally rambling inquiry into the contradictions of contemporary American life. Three stories examine different parts of the capitalist food chain: illegal immigrants from Mexico work in terrible conditions in a meat-processing plant; a restaurant chain executive undergoes a crisis of conscience; and a teenage burger-slinger is drawn into political activism. Mr. Linklater covers a lot of ground, and the result is an unusually funny, moving and intellectually demanding movie. (Scott)\n* 'FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' (R, 132 minutes) Clint Eastwood raises the flag over Iwo Jima once more in a powerful if imperfect film about the uses of war and of the men who fight. The fine cast includes Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach, who delivers heartbreak by the payload. (Dargis)\n'FLANNEL PAJAMAS' (No rating, 124 minutes) The twin specters of Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen hover over this film, which might have been more accurately titled \"Scenes From a Mixed Marriage\" or \"Annie Hall Without Laughs.\" This smart, talky history of a relationship between two New Yorkers follows a Jewish theatrical promoter and an aspiring caterer from a Roman Catholic background from courtship to marriage to separation. (Holden)\n* 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (\"Wallace and Gromit,\" \"Chicken Run\") is completely delightful. (Scott)\n'THE FOUNTAIN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Darren Aronovsky's new film spans a thousand years, as Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman pursue undying love and eternal life in the 16th, 21st and 26th centuries. There is some lovely visual poetry, but the ideas are pure doggerel, an ungainly mixture of sci-fi overreach and earnest sentimentality. (Scott)\n'FOUR EYED MONSTERS' (No rating, 70 minutes) In this truly modern romance, a merging of reality and re-enacted scenes from reality, two young, creative Brooklynites who met online approach their developing relationship as an art project. (Laura Kern)\n'FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION' (PG-13, 86 minutes) This satire of pre-Oscar nomination buzz in Hollywood is far and away the broadest comedy Christopher Guest and his improvisatory company have made. It is also the flimsiest, and unlike Mr. Guest's earlier films, it has no airs of being a fake documentary. As farce trumps satire, the humor's subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, except for the brilliant exception of Catherine O'Hara. (Holden)\n'HAPPY FEET' (PG, 100 minutes) The director George Miller gets happy and snappy, then goes dark and deep, in a musical about an animated penguin who was born to dance. Take hankies. (Dargis)\n'HERMANAS' (No rating, 100 minutes, in Spanish) The ghost of 1970s Argentina haunts 1980s Texas in this perceptive and beautifully acted drama from the Argentine director Julia Solomonoff. After eight years of exile in Spain, Natalia (Ingrid Rubio) travels to Texas to visit her sister, Elena (Valeria Bertuccelli), a suburban wife and mother. Extensive flashbacks to the sisters' teenage years during the military dictatorship reveal a rich vein of familial guilt and long-suppressed resentment. But the movie is most successful in the rocky emotional spaces in which the women struggle to reconcile over a chasm of political discord and unanswered questions. (Jeannette Catsoulis)\n'THE HISTORY BOYS' (R, 104 minutes) The current of intellectual energy snapping through this engaging screen adaptation of Alan Bennett's Tony Award-winning play, set in a north England boys' school in 1983, feels like electrical brain stimulation. As two teachers jockey for the hearts and minds of eight teenage schoolboys preparing to apply to Oxford and Cambridge, their epigrams send up small jolts of pleasure and excitement. How to teach and interpret history is the question. (Holden)\n* 'INLAND EMPIRE' (No rating, 179 minutes) David Lynch's extraordinary, savagely uncompromised new film stars a dazzling Laura Dern as an actress who tumbles down rabbit holes inside rabbit holes inside rabbit holes. As cracked as Mad magazine, though generally more difficult to parse, the film has the power of nightmares and is one of the few this year that deserves to be called art. (Dargis)\n'NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VAN WILDER 2: THE RISE OF TAJ' (R, 98 minutes) Britain and India face off in this strained attempt to transplant the American campus comedy to more uptight shores. Now graduated from college -- and sidekick status -- Taj Mahal Badalandabad (Kal Penn) heads to Camford University in England to pursue a Ph.D. and a bad reputation. While the screenplay dives into British history, and the camera dives into every cleavage in sight, the director, Mort Nathan, harnesses smut and silliness to an oddly innocent tale of true love. (Catsoulis)\n'THE NATIVITY STORY' (PG, 100 minutes) Nothing earth-shaking, but a fine performance by Keisha Castle-Hughes as Mary offers a glimpse of an interesting movie tucked inside what is otherwise an unsurprising and tasteful Christmas pageant. (Scott)\n* 'SHUT UP & SING' (R, 93 minutes) Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck's revealing documentary follows the Dixie Chicks around for three years as the group deals with the consequences of a remark by its lead singer, Natalie Maines, who said from a London stage that they were ashamed that the president of the United States was from Texas. The movie is a fascinating study of the relationship between the media, politics and the music industry in an era in which pop musicians are marketed like politicians. (Holden)\n* '10 ITEMS OR LESS' (R, 82 minutes) A sweet and modest film by Brad Silberling, in which a fading actor (Morgan Freeman) and a supermarket checkout worker (Paz Vega) spend a day together not doing much of anything. (Scott)\n'TENACIOUS D IN THE PICK OF DESTINY' (R, 87 minutes) As it wobbles from one episode to the next, this rock 'n' roll comedy starring Jack Black is a garish mess, and some of it feels padded. But it has enough jokes to keep you smiling, and Mr. Black brings to it a fervent affection for the music he spoofs but obviously adores.

(Jon Pareles)\n* CORINNE BAILEY RAE (Wednesday) Even when she is singing about heartbreak and desperation, and griping that love is \"a type of loan with no dividends,\" it is hard not to be seduced by Ms. Bailey Rae, a 27-year-old British singer and guitarist who is this year's breakout soul star. In a sweet, tissue-thin voice that can recall Macy Gray or Sade, she sings of sisterly rituals, loves lost and her \"choux pastry heart.\" At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, the-townhall-nyc.org; $26.50.

(Sisario)\nCIARA (Sunday) This 21-year-old R&B singer had a big, flirty hit a few summers ago with \"Goodies,\" in which she turned away a suitor while teasingly declaring \"I'm no rookie\" over a steady synthesizer wolf whistle. She's back with a new album whose first single, \"Promise,\" has a less provocative message. \"I've been looking for somebody to talk to,\" she sings. \"Is that you?\" At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $35.

(He also reveals some maturity -- gasp! -- on slower, quieter songs.) Brand New pushes emo into the realm of Pink Floyd and U2, with tangles of explosive melody and rich, complex songs about spiritual crisis. At 7:30, Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $26.50 to $34.50. (Sisario)\nDONNA THE BUFFALO (Tonight) Donna the Buffalo is not named for its fiddler and singer, Tara Nevins.

At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $18.

(Pareles)\n* THE EX (Wednesday) Visits from this long-running Dutch band are too rare. Devoted to leftist political ideals, the group chocks its lyrics full of topical allusions and has been known to include 140-page books about the Spanish Revolution with its albums. Admirable, sure. But in concert the Ex is blessedly all about the beat: a brawny, anxious punk-funk that never releases its tension. The effect is unforgettably visceral. With Aloha and DJ/rupture. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $12. (Sisario)\nGOOD FOR THE JEWS (Thursday) The tree has been lighted in Rockefeller Center, and the department store window displays have gone up, which means that it's time for the annual ritual of comedians and rockers musing on the true meaning of being Jewish at Christmas.

(Sisario)\nWANDA JACKSON (Tomorrow) Wild boys weren't the whole story of 1950s rockabilly. Ms. Jackson, from Oklahoma, was out on the road too, belting songs like \"Fujiyama Mama\" (a big hit in Japan) and \"Mean Mean Man.\" In the '70s she became a Christian and turned to singing church music. But in 1996 one of her fans, the honky-tonk singer Rosie Flores, sought her out for duets, and since then Ms. Jackson has been reclaiming her crown as queen of rockabilly. With the Lustre Kings.

(Sisario)\nO'DEATH (Sunday and Wednesday) This New York band draws from the starkness and spiritual purity of Appalachian folk, the noisemongering of punk and the rowdy theatricality of Tom Waits.

(Sisario)\nPERNICE BROTHERS, ELVIS PERKINS (Tonight) Call it Kleenex rock: the sound is delicate, the voices soft and whispery, the mood really, really sad. The Pernice Brothers surround tales of woe with careful pop artistry that draws a little from country. The plaintive and tuneful songs of Elvis Perkins, from Providence, R.I., have been tapped for mood music on \"The OC.\" At 8:30, with Sono Oto, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $15.

(Sisario)\nSIZZLA (Monday) Like Buju Banton before him, Sizzla has figured out that idealism can be just as fearsome as nihilism. He's astonishingly prolific (he releases two or three albums a year) and versatile, equally at home with roots reggae grooves and digital dancehall beats. Whether he's singing an Afrocentric love song or screaming for revenge against \"Babylon,\" his fervent voice turns every lyric into a life-or-death struggle. At 8 p.m., B. B.

(Sisario)\n* WE ARE SCIENTISTS, OXFORD COLLAPSE, THE GRATES (Tomorrow) We Are Scientists and Oxford Collapse, both from New York, revive postpunk in different ways. We Are Scientists sings about bohemia and boredom (\"I'm sick of waking up on your floor/For the sixth or seventh night in a row\") over a spiky discopunk groove derived from Gang of Four, while Oxford Collapse looks to the tense jangle of Television and the Feelies. The Grates, from Australia, borrow their passionate, joyful amateurism from classic riot grrrl.

This week, as in the shows she recorded earlier this year for her album \"Live at the Blue Note\" (DRG), she leads a hushed band and uses the intimacy of the club to return to music she grew up on, particularly the bossa novas of Antonio Carlos Jobim: Brazilian classics sung with pure, knowing poise.

(Allan Kozinn)\nEFE BALTACIGIL (Tonight) This talented Turkish cellist has gained attention in a number of ways. He has won an Avery Fisher Career Grant and the Young Concert Artists auditions.

Tonight he appears as part of Carnegie Hall's Rising Stars series, with the pianist Anna Polonsky, in a program of Bach, Shostakovich, Ahmet Adnan Saygun and Franck.

Now the society has a new creative team -- the cellist David Finckel and his wife, the pianist Wu Han -- and it tells you something about its creative vitality that a centerpiece of its programming this season is a Baroque festival, performed on modern instruments and devoted entirely to crowd-pleasers. The opening program, inventively called \"Baroque Collection,\" includes music by Telemann, Bach, Marais and Vivaldi.

John Scott leads the church's choir of men and boys, accompanied by Concert Royal, a fine period-instrument orchestra. This year there is a twist: instead of performing one of several surviving Handel versions (he revised a lot), Mr. Scott is offering the work in Mozart's colorfully expansive orchestration. The soloists are Ava Pine, soprano; Kirsten Sollek, alto; Joseph Gaines, tenor; and Sumner Thompson, bass.

They frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images you merely sense that some horrible violence has occurred, or is about to happen. The moralizing of these images can become a little tedious. But this artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. 200 Eastern Parkway at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000. (Benjamin Genocchio)\n* SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso,' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Vel\u00e1zquezes and Zurbar\u00e1ns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dal\u00eds and Picassos, many famous, many not. The big point is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Vel\u00e1zquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman)\n* THE METropolitan museum of art: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s,' through Feb. 19. This show's 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)\n* THE MET: 'LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL -- AN ARTIST'S COUNTRY ESTATE,' through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound -- and of the Tiffany residences preceding it -- is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)\n* MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: \"SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,\" through March 4. A cartoonist-artist extraordinaire, Saul Steinberg (1914-99) was a veritable Leonardo of graphic drollery. His famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything -- Floridians, linguistic concepts, erotica, cowboys, Cubism, nature, architecture and women -- with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 Steinberg drawings, collages and constructions, arranged in chronological order, goes on, Steinberg's progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like \"Feet on Chair\" (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like \"Street War (Cadavre Exquisis)\" (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008. (Grace Glueck)\n* MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG'S NEW YORK,' through March 25. A very lively adjunct to the Morgan show, this smaller display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here in one incarnation, looming majestically over humble brownstones; in another, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg's eyes, could be monuments, too. And no one ever fully appreciated the impact of upscale New York women until Steinberg the misogynist came along. \"Fur Coats\" (1951), portrays four expensive baroque pelts wearing four women, and it's dead on. You may think you know Steinberg's work, but these two shows make it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672. (Glueck)\n* NEUE GALLERY: 'JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,' through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or \"total work of art,\" orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. Neue Gallery, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)\nP.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'John Latham: Time Base and the Universe,' through Jan. 8. This retrospective of John Latham spans nearly 50 years of Mr. Latham's work, which is concerned with time, preservation and decay. Among the more idiosyncratic and interesting pieces are a series of \"Cluster\" sculptures from the early 1990s, orbs of plaster embedded with books and suspended from the ceiling, which suggest cultural detritus preserved in celestial rock or geological magma. \"The N-U Niddrie Heart\" (around 1990), in which \"The Pregnancy Survival Manual\" and \"Vanished Species\" are cut up and fitted into glass armatures, with sand scattered around their bases, explores human production (and reproduction) and the passage of time. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Martha Schwendener)\nStudio Museum in Harlem: 'Africa Comics,' through March 18. Intense is the word for the stealth-potency of this modest-size, first-time United States survey of original designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense, the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. The entertainment value is high. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids, and the schlumpy but wily character named Goorgoolou from Senegal. But more often than not, humor is sugar-coating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Holland Cotter)\nWhitney Museum of American Art: Kiki Smith: 'A Gathering, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float in \"Kiki Smith\": men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed to its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Cotter)\nGalleries: Uptown\nSigmar Polke Painting is man's oldest conjuring trick, and Sigmar Polke is one of its reigning magicians. In this show new paintings and those from the 1980s, all two-sided and painted with resin, surround a small selection of German Baroque amber (Bernstein is German for amber) jewelry and exquisite tchotchkes. The show simulates a Wunderkammer, a darkened wonder cabinet of the 17th or 18th century. The paintings, made translucent by the resin, nearly defy deciphering. Doodles and abstract splashes of white paint overlay murky washes of glowing resin on both sides of their membranous support, then cast dim shadows on the wall behind, so that the pictures seem suspended in midair, floating. Michael Werner Gallery, 4 East 77th Street, Manhattan, (212) 988-1623, through Jan. 13. (Kimmelman)\nGalleries: Chelsea\nAric Obrosey Mr. Obrosey's fastidious graphite depictions of woven and knotted threads have a mesmerizing, meditative quality. Care in the making encourages care in looking. In close-up the motifs combine elements of straightforward trompe l'oeil. Each strand of these lacelike compositions behaves according to strict spatial and structural rules; they may twist and turn, conform or deviate eccentrically. But reality is respected, even when the strands coalesce at the center into a mandalalike circle or a wildly knotted disco ball. And the illusions go deeper: Each strand is something like a world unto itself, with distinct, chainlike structures or decorative patterns that suggest different cultures or other crafts. The strands pulse like arteries of tiny lights in a work dedicated to Felix Gonzalez-Torres. Greater than Mr. Obrosey's drawing skill is his ability to convert what might be called Conceptual content into visual terms. McKenzie Fine Art, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 989-5467, www.mckenziefineart.com, through Dec. 20. (Smith)\nOther Galleries\n* 'Looking Back' This inaugural edition of a new White Columns Annual is designed, like the old-time Whitney Biennial, to offer a recap of contemporary art of the immediate past, and in this case the art of a single New York gallery season past. It's a great idea, a chance to linger over shows seen in a rush, or entirely missed, or fondly remembered. The curator, Matthew Higgs, director of White Columns, has made satisfyingly unobvious choices, and any show that includes Klara Liden and Stuart Sherman is a winner. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street (entrance on Horatio Street), West Village, (212) 924-4212, through Dec. 20. (Cotter)\nPublic Art\nNINA KATCHADOURIAN: 'OFFICE SEMAPHORE' Ms. Katchadourian has borrowed marine flag signaling techniques to create an interactive art project consisting of an old-fashioned tourist telescope installed at the corner of a plaza in the middle of the financial district, its lens trained on the window of an upper-floor office in a nearby skyscraper. Each day the man working in the office, or his assistant, arranges objects on his widow sill. The combination and order of the objects represent a specific message, which viewers down on the plaza can interpret using a key-chart on the telescope. 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, corner of Liberty and William Streets; stairway entrance to the plaza is on William Street at Cedar Street; www.publicartfund.org, Jan. 14. (Genocchio)\nLast Chance\n* Asia society: 'ONE WAY OR ANOTHER: ASIAN AMERICAN ART NOW' Taking its name from a 1978 hit by Blondie, this lively exhibition finds a new vitality and freedom, especially where identity is involved, in Asian-American art. The artists' roots range from Iran to Korea. Keep a special eye out for Mari Eastman's wryly beautiful paintings; Mika Tajima's glamorous deconstruction of Minimalism; and the video-performance efforts of Patty Chang, Laurel Nakadate and Xavier Cha. An added bonus: 12, or 71 percent, of the show's 17 artists are women. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)\nChristian Jankowski: 'Us and them' This show is smart in its exploration of what might be called the banality of feigned evil, but it also feels predictable. Mr. Jankowsky gets closest to real emotion in the 11-minute \"Angels of Revenge,\" in which 12 costume contestants at a horror film convention walk slowly toward the camera while reciting their most dire revenge fantasies. A wolf man complains about having his cellphone stolen; a \"Night of the Living Dead\" type waves a chain saw; a man in a bloody chef's suit suggests a found-art Paul McCarthy video. It is hard to decide if the lameness of their efforts indicates that most people aren't violent, that horror buffs need to get a life, or that Mr. Jankowski's interventionism is temporarily in a rut. The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, thekitchen.org; closes tomorrow. (Smith)\nThe Met: 'New Orleans After the Flood: Photographs by Robert Polidori,' After Hurricane Katrina, Mr. Polidori went to New Orleans, where he lived years ago, to shoot photographs of the devastation for The New Yorker. He took hundreds of pictures with a large-format camera that produced wide, superbly detailed color photographs. Mr. Polidori is a connoisseur of chaos, and the beauty of his pictures -- they have a languid, almost underwater beauty -- entails locating order in bedlam. He also photographed signs of recovery: trailers and construction equipment; a few historic homes, stripped to their frames, shorn, on the verge of new life. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Kimmelman)\n* Futoshi Miyagi In his New York solo debut this young, gay, Japanese-born artist works toward self-assertion through self-effacement. He poses with strangers in their apartments for photographic records of illusional domesticity. In the gallery he recreates a picture-covered wall from his own bedroom, but includes only the tacks that held the pictures in place. He dissolves a portrait of himself, taken by a friend, in a bottle of bleach so that the features are erased. Daniel Reich Gallery, 537A West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-4949; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)\n'Moving Pictures: American Art and Early Film, 1880-1910' What's thought to be the first movie kiss, between May Irwin and John C. Rice, occurred in 1896, photographed by the Edison Manufacturing Company as the subject of a 19-second film shown at a New York music hall. It and dozens of other early movie treasures, along with fine art of the period, are shown in this engrossing if learned survey of the links -- both planned and happenstance -- between the earliest movies and other American visual art forms at the turn of the 20th century. Throughout the show, provocative juxtapositions are made of films and paintings by Thomas Eakins, Maurice Prendergast, Childe Hassam, George Bellows and John Sloan, among others. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, www.nyu.edu/greyart; closes tomorrow. (Glueck)\nBetty Parsons: 'Painted Sculpture' In the decade before she died in 1982, at 82, Ms. Parsons began cobbling together scraps of lumber, boats and signs that washed up on the beach near her summer house on the North Fork of Long Island. She added unobtrusive touches of color: mostly stripes that waver somewhere between Mondrian and festive war paint, but also circles and dabs, often in response to nail holes or the faded hues from the wood's earlier life. The resulting works qualify as an endearing yet somehow rigorous folk-modernism. Art Gallery of the Graduate Center, City University of New York, 365 Fifth Avenue, at 34th Street, www.gc.cuny.edu; closes tomorrow. (Smith)\nCatherine Yass: 'Lock' How big is the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River? Judging by the size of its locks, very. Their monumentality and what they tell us of nature's power and man's ability to harness it are the chief subjects of this imposing two-screen film installation. Shot from a crane high on a barge during passes through the dam's locks, the facing screens provide a fore and aft view of the journey, perfectly synched. The gallery feels like the barge's invisible middle section. You don't quite realize the immensity of the structures until you notice the tiny figures moving along gangways at the barges' edges. As a metaphor for the new China, it is pretty intimidating. Galerie LeLong, 528 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 315-0470, www.galerielelong.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)",

    "text": "The next industrial giant is ... India? - Business - International Herald Tribune\n2006-08-31T05:00:00.000Z\nPUNE, India \u2014 India's economic advancement no longer rests on telephone call centers and computer programmers.\nAmong villages with thatch-roofed huts and dirt roads on the outskirts of this city in west-central India, John Deere and LG have recently built factories turning out tractors and color television sets for sale in India and for export to the United States.\nIn Hazira, in northwestern India, where some residents still rely on camels as beasts of burden, Essar Group is making steel to be used for ventilation shafts in Philadelphia, high- rise structural beams in Chicago and car engine mountings in Detroit.\nFor decades, India had followed a very different route to economic development than Japan, South Korea or China. While its Asian rivals placed bets on manufacturing and exports, India focused on its domestic economy and grew more slowly with an emphasis on services.\nBut all that is starting to change.\nIndia's annual growth in manufacturing output, at 9 percent and accelerating, is close to catching up to growth in services, at 10 percent. Exports of manufactured goods to the United States are now rising faster in percentage terms than China's, although from a much smaller base. More than two-thirds of foreign investment in the past year has gone into manufacturing in India, not services.\n\"Saying we are a back office and China is a factory is a backhanded compliment,\" said the Indian minister of commerce and industry, Kamal Nath. \"It's not really correct.\"\nIn interviews at 18 Indian factories and other businesses in 10 cities and villages scattered across the nation, the picture that emerges is of a country that is being driven by advances in manufacturing to a much brisker pace of economic growth.\nA prime reason India is developing into the world's next big industrial power is that a number of global manufacturers are already looking ahead to a serious demographic crunch in China. Because of China's \"one child\" policy, family sizes have been shrinking since the 1980s, so fewer young people will be available soon for factory labor.\nIndia is not expected to pass China in population until 2030. But India will have more workers ages 20 to 24 by 2013; the International Labor Organization predicts that by 2020, India will have 116 million workers in this age bracket, compared with 94 million in China.\nIndia's young population will also make it a growing market for years to come, while the engineering and English skills of its elite will make it competitive across a wide range of industries.\nSo even though India remains a difficult place to do business - its roads are poor and power is often scarce - several multinational companies have been placing big bets on India this year in hopes of taking advantage of this shifting global dynamic.\nGeneral Motors and Motorola are preparing to build plants in western and southern India. Posco, the South Korean steel maker, and Mittal Steel, the Dutch- based conglomerate, have each announced plans to erect giant mills in eastern India, where the Indian company Reliance will soon construct one of the world's largest coal-fired power plants.\nAnd they are finding the Indian labor force well suited to their goals. When LG wanted to fill 458 assembly line jobs at its factory here last year to make appliances at a starting wage of $90 a month, it required that each applicant have at least 15 years of education, which is usually high school plus a technical college.\nSeeking a young work force, the company decided that no more than 1 percent of the workers could have had any prior work experience. Despite the limitation, 55,000 young people met its criteria.\n\"In the villages there is little income,\" Siddu Matheapattu, 24, said in between applying sealant to refrigerator frames. \"Here I can earn more.\"\nBy contrast, cities in the southeastern Chinese province of Guangdong raised monthly minimum wages this summer by 18 percent to between $70 and $100 a month after factories reported having one million more jobs than workers to fill them. Factories elsewhere in China face fewer labor shortages, but they also are being pressured to raise wages.\nAs India has opened up its economy, output has gradually accelerated to a growth rate of 8 percent a year, feeding a national euphoria and a few hopes of someday even beating China's annual growth of more than 10 percent.\nPlenty of obstacles remain, however, notably India's weak infrastructure. China invests $7 on roads, ports, electricity and other foundations of a modern economy for every $1 spent by India - and it shows. Ports here are struggling to handle exports, blackouts are frequent and dirt roads are common even in Bangalore, the center of the country's computer programming industry.\nPervasive corruption has slowed many efforts to fix these problems. India's labor laws, little changed since independence in 1947, also continue to discourage companies from hiring workers because it is difficult to lay off employees even in a downturn.\nStill, a new optimism prevails in India, bordering at times on euphoria.\n\"The Chinese are very good at copying things, but Indians believe in quality work - we believe in meeting pollution norms,\" said S.S. Pathania, the assistant general manager of the Hero Honda motorcycle factory in Gurgaon. \"I think India will pass China very soon.\"\nNext to a gray tidal estuary, the scale of Essar Group's steel-making and power generation complex in Hazira is already impressive. Essar has its own port to bring in iron ore, its own large, natural gas-fired power plant for electricity and a steel mill.\nBut the complex is just starting to grow. Essar is quintupling steel production and pushing forward a sevenfold increase in power generation, most of it for sale to a national grid desperately short of electricity.\nGrowth on that scale, especially in industries like steel and power but also in areas like car parts and household appliances, is what India has long lacked. Industrial production accounts for only a fifth of India's economic output, compared with two-fifths of China's.\nUntil recently, legislation effectively barred companies with over 100 people from competing in many industries. The laws were intended to protect tiny businesses in villages, often employing women and minorities; high tariffs were placed on imports as well.\nOne result was hundreds of thousands of businesses too small to be competitive; India lags behind even Bangladesh in clothing exports. The Indian government has responded by narrowing the list of protected industries to 326 categories from 20,000 and has lowered tariffs.\nComparing factories in India to their competitors in China, many of the Indian factories are smaller but some appear more efficient.\nIndia's stronger financial system demands higher interest rates than China's state-owned banks, making it costlier to finance the small mountains of components awaiting assembly that are often seen in Chinese factories.\nThe Confederation of Indian Industry, a trade group, has also successfully pushed companies to adopt the latest Japanese lean manufacturing techniques.\nThe drawback is that the nation's manufacturing boom, built on higher- quality goods made under more modern conditions than in China, is not likely to create as many factory jobs as India needs. The Essar steel mill, for example, has been replacing old, labor-intensive equipment with more modern gear.\n\"We were having it all done manually, but because the customers demand very high quality, we have to do it automatically,\" Rajesh Pandita, an Essar manager, yelled over the roar of a machine that was stretching a coil of steel the size of a minivan through rollers until it was little thicker than plastic kitchen wrap.\nThe Whirlpool factory in Pune uses machines, not people, to fold the steel exteriors of refrigerators together. It has some of the highest productivity per worker of any Whirlpool factory, with just 208 line workers producing up to 33,000 refrigerators a month.\nStill, labor laws discourage flexibility. They bar companies from allowing manufacturing workers to put in more than 54 hours of overtime in a three- month period even if the workers want to earn extra money. The legislation requires double wages and an equal number of hours of paid vacation later to make up for overtime.\n\"Companies think twice, 10 times before they hire new people,\" said Sunil Kant Munjal, chairman of Hero Group, one of the world's largest manufacturers of inexpensive motorcycles.\nHero in Gurgaon, on the southern outskirts of New Delhi, and its archrival, Lifan Group in Chongqing, China, produce comparable motorcycles but the similarity ends there. Hero markets heavily to the Indian market, protected from foreign competition by high tariffs, while China's Lifan emphasizes exports.\nWith scant ventilation, Lifan's factories are filled with diesel exhaust as workers test engines and ride finished bikes at breakneck speed out the doors, zigzagging past co-workers.\nHero's factory in Gurgaon, where Honda holds a minority stake, has far better safety standards and excellent ventilation.\nThe Lifan factory pays less than $100 per month. The Hero factory, which is heavily unionized, pays $150 a month plus bonuses of up to $370 per month; nearly half the workers earn the top bonus, said Pathania, the assistant general manager .\nWhile Lifan's labor force is quiescent, would-be organizers of independent labor unions face long prison terms or worse in China. Hero's workers staged a successful nonviolent protest last year to call for more contract workers to be eligible for the bonuses as well.\nDespite such obstacles, India's manufacturing sector appears poised for further growth. In a country where the national symbol has shifted from government bureaucrats at aging desks to call center operators in cubicles, the next icon looks like it will be the laptop- toting engineer on a factory floor.\n\"The old philosophy was 'I should work in an office, come in at 10 and leave at 4,'\" said Nitin Kulkarni, 35, an engineer at the Hazira steel mill. But in recent years, he added, \"there has been a revolution.\"",

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.\nMuseums\n \u2605 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: \u2018GOLD,\u2019 through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. \n(Roberta Smith)\n BROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018WATERCOLORS BY WALTON FORD,\u2019 through Jan. 28. This show assembles more than 50 of Mr. Ford\u2019s large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora. They frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images the sense is that some horrible violence has occurred or is about to happen. This artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.\n(Benjamin Genocchio)\n  COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM : \u2018DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,\u2019 through July 29. This ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design as a whole, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas, sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith) \n \u2605 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018SPANISH PAINTING FROM EL GRECO TO PICASSO,\u2019 through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Vel\u00e1zquezes and Zurbar\u00e1ns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dal\u00eds and Picassos, many famous, many not. The big point is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman) \n \u2605 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920S,\u2019 through Feb. 19. This show\u2019s 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic\u2019s porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) \n \u2605 THE MET: \u2018LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL \u0097 AN ARTIST\u2019S COUNTRY ESTATE,\u2019 through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house- museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound \u0097 and of the Tiffany residences preceding it \u0097 is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany\u2019s genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (See above.) (Smith)\n \u2605 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: \u2018SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,\u2019 through March 4. Saul Steinberg\u2019s famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything \u0097 Floridians, linguistic concepts, erotica, cowboys, Cubism, nature, architecture and women \u0097 with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 drawings, collages and constructions goes on, Steinberg\u2019s progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like \u201cFeet on Chair\u201d (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like \u201cStreet War (Cadavre Exquisis)\u201d (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Grace Glueck)\n \u2605 MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: \u2018A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG\u2019S NEW YORK,\u2019 through March 25. A very lively adjunct to the Morgan show, this smaller display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here looming majestically over brownstones and in another incarnation, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg\u2019s eyes, could be monuments, too. And no one ever fully appreciated the impact of upscale New York women until Steinberg the misogynist came along. \u201cFur Coats\u201d (1951) portrays four expensive baroque pelts wearing four women, and it\u2019s dead on. You may think you know Steinberg\u2019s work, but these shows make it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Glueck)\n \u2605 NEUE GALLERY: \u2018JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,\u2019 through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Mr. Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or \u201ctotal work of art,\u201d orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Glueck)\n \n QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018QUEENS INTERNATIONAL 2006: EVERYTHING ALL AT ONCE,\u2019 through Jan. 14. The 52 artists and two collaboratives in this exhibition are natives of various regions of North America, as well as Bosnia, China, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Peru and Venezuela. The only common ground, perhaps, is that they all live in Queens. Instead of arranging the work according to medium, ethnicity or generalized themes, the curators follow the edict of the exhibition\u2019s subtitle. The exhibition tries to balance the interests of the art crowd and local residents. Sometimes these concerns dovetail nicely, as in Sophia Peer\u2019s quick-cut video \u201cEveryday,\u201d which shows her aging parents moving around their cramped home in Queens like latter-day, empty-nest Bunkers. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, www.queensmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener) \n STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: \u2018AFRICA COMICS,\u2019 through March 18. Intense is the word for this modest-size first-time United States survey of designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense, the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. The entertainment value is high. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids, and the schlumpy but wily character named Goorgoolou from Senegal. But more often than not, humor is sugarcoating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. \n(Holland Cotter) \n WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018KIKI SMITH: A GATHERING, 1980-2005,\u2019 through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float here: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum\u2019s black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith\u2019s art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter)\nGalleries: Uptown\n \u2605 \u2018AMERICAN MASTERWORKS FROM THE MUNSON-WILLIAMS-PROCTOR ARTS INSTITUTE\u2019 This Utica, N.Y., institution, celebrating its educational alliance with New York City\u2019s Pratt Institute, is showing more than 75 paintings, drawings, sculptures and furniture pieces, from the 18th to the 20th centuries. A highlight is the original version of Thomas Cole\u2019s moving allegory \u201cThe Voyage of Life\u201d (1839-40), which in four monumental canvases compares the journey from childhood to old age with the winding course of a river. A smashing portrait of the Revolutionary War general Peter Gansevoort (about 1794) by Gilbert Stuart is a distinguished entry from the earlier part of the show. Post-World War II paintings by Pollock and Rothko add to the buzz. Hirschl & Adler, 21 East 70th Street, (212) 535-8810, hirschlandadler.com, through Dec. 29. (Glueck)\n \u2605 \u2018THE ODYSSEY CONTINUES: MASTERWORKS FROM THE NEW ORLEANS MUSEUM OF ART AND FROM PRIVATE NEW ORLEANS COLLECTIONS\u2019 Nearly 100 European and American objects covering six centuries, from the New Orleans Museum of Art but also from private lenders, are displayed. They range from the Venetian-born Lorenzo Lotto, whose forceful study of an authoritative figure, \u201cPortrait of a Bearded Man\u201d (1530-35), is a highlight, to works by contemporary Americans. A showstopper is a full-length portrait of Marie Antoinette (about 1788) by Elizabeth Vigee-Lebrun, in which the doomed French queen wears an enormous feathered concoction on the head she was eventually to lose. Sculptures by Rodin, Brancusi, Louise Bourgeois and Louise Nevelson are also part of the treasures on view. The show is a benefit for the New Orleans Museum, whose building \u0097 though not its art \u0097 was battered by Hurricane Katrina. Wildenstein, 19 East 64th Street, (212) 879-0500, wildenstein.com, through Feb. 9. (Glueck) \n  \nLast Chance\nDENNIS BALK: HASHISH Abstract Expressionism meets Graffiti photography. Cy Twombly in Cyberspace. Existential physics. The trajectories of car bombs. These phrases came to mind in front of Dennis Balk\u2019s garbled computer-generated drawings on canvas and digitally mixed color photographs. Randomness, violence and information overload are intimated with a handful of portrait-snapshots of Arab men, taken at a Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan, functioning as still points. Michael Steinberg Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-6232, michaelsteinbergfineart.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)\nDAVID BATES This Texas painter\u2019s 14th New York solo show since 1983 features still lifes that bristle like carpentered objects, bayou swampscapes that make nature seem both beautiful and doomed, and portraits of angry Gulf Coast residents (taken from television) who got the short end of the stick when Hurricane Katrina passed through. The residents bring into the open the smoldering aggression that always keeps Mr. Bates\u2019s canvases from sitting quietly on the wall and give it the force of immediate human emotions and events. D. C. Moore Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue near 57th Street, (212) 247-2111; closes today. (Smith)\nSLATER BRADLEY: \u2018THE ABANDONMENTS\u2019 This show features six new, contemplative video works. In \u201cDark Night of the Soul\u201d (2005-6), which invokes Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d a figure in a space suit is shown wandering through the exotic scenery of the American Museum of Natural History after hours, to the poetic sound of a flute. The chic, odd camera angles suggest detachment, making the suited figure seem as if he were visiting some strange, remote world. Team Gallery, 83 Grand Street, (212) 279-9219, teamgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Genocchio) \nNATHAN CARTER On the surface, Mr. Carter\u2019s work is all about communication, transportation and networks. Big, sprawling sculptures and rough collages recreate the hectic spaghetti of subway lines and the intricate wiring of radio circuitry. The work itself cultivates the look of the amateur, the hobbyist with a ham radio or a backyard workshop and a jigsaw churning out crudely built constructions that look as if they might topple over at any second. At the same time, there\u2019s an offhanded vapidity to these references that suggests they are little more than visual candy for the graphically attuned eye. Casey Kaplan, 525 West 21st Street, (212) 645-7335, caseykaplangallery.com; closes today. (Schwendener) \n \u2605 JOHN CURRIN The leading bad boy of figurative painting is trying his best to be even more provocative. While he usually paints in series, here he has many options under consideration: pornography, romance, still life, portraits of all kinds. The result is a Currin medley that functions as a kind of installation brought off with a new, somewhat vacuous facility. But the paintings with the most Currinesque goofiness and distortions are still the best. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313, gagosian.com; closes today. (Smith)\n CHRIS DUNCAN: THE CONTINUED EXPLORATION OF PINK AND BROWN In his New York debut, this young artist from Oakland, Calif., continues the tradition of men who draw (and glue) by sewing that dates back at least to Alan Shields. His richly colored, semi-abstract works on paper, sometimes sewn together into expansive surfaces, combine geometric structures with scattered drips, accrue into playful but quietly magnetic m\u00e9langes of decorative and mystical, and East and West. Jeff Bailey Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 989-0156, baileygallery.com; closes today. (Smith) \n ALLAN MCCOLLUM: THE SHAPES PROJECT Long interested in works that question notions of originality and invention, Mr. McCollum has devised a computer program that could eventually generate a unique abstract motif for everyone in the world. In the meantime, he has produced and framed 7,056 of them (at small scale) and arranged them on a floor-to-ceiling ramp with 98 steps. The effect \u0097 a stadium full of art looking at you, the viewer \u0097 is quite amazing. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 680-9467, petzel.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)\n \u2605 GEORGE ORTMAN: EARLY CONSTRUCTIONS, NEW SCULPTURE In the late 1950s and early \u201860s, Mr. Ortman combined paint, canvas, plaster and wood into geometric reliefs whose every element was physically discrete. Hailed as exemplary \u201cspecific objects\u201d by Donald Judd, they took some tips from Jasper Johns\u2019s flag and target paintings and gave others to Judd\u2019s own work. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 242-6242, mitchellalgus.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)\n STEPHEN PRINA: THE SECOND SENTENCE OF EVERYTHING I READ IS YOU A quietly delirious multimedia environmental listening lounge that incorporates on painting, sculpture, design, appropriation, music and performance as well as its own shipping crates. The choral music, written and recorded by the artist and incorporating phrases from writing on art and economics, is especially nice. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 680-9467, petzel.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)\n \u2605 TL SOLEIN: INSULATUS In these large, ingeniously made works on paper, which combine stenciling, bright cutout collage and washy fields of color, Mr. Solein brings his considerable pictorial sense to bear on \u201cMoby-Dick.\u201d He borrows from 19th-century illustration and folk art as well as personal memory, creating intimate stage-set-like scenes that can evoke anything from puppet shows to Cubism. The results frequently dazzle and sustain comparison with equally well-sourced but better-known paper wizards, from Donald Baechler to Jockum Nordstrom. Luise Ross Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 343-2161, luiserossgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)",

    "text": "Lights Out\n2006-11-19T05:00:00.000Z\nONE evening late last month, Gary Dennis was striding around Movie Place, his video store on 105th Street near Broadway, with a cordless phone clamped to his ear. His graying hair was brushed back, and he spoke, as usual, out of the side of his mouth. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to be in this industry anymore,\u201d he told the caller. \u201cThe industry\u2019s dying.\u201d He waited a beat, then added, \u201cI\u2019m going to sell drugs to junior high schoolers.\u201d\nMovie Place, which occupies a pale yellow room in a second-floor storefront, has 24,000 titles, making it one of New York\u2019s best-stocked video stores; the average Blockbuster carries only about 5,000 films. Movie Place\u2019s holdings \u2014 sealed in binders, arranged in wooden crates, shelved high on every wall \u2014 include commercial hits but also the very obscure, from a 1984 self-help video starring Mr. T to a biopic of Karen Carpenter acted out with Barbie dolls.\nPresiding over this treasure house is Mr. Dennis, a fierce-browed, loose-jointed 45-year-old who fills the air with a giddy mix of film trivia, sharp asides and ribbing. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like \u2018Arrested Development\u2019!\u201d he shouted, pointing at a customer in mock outrage. \u201cShould we throw him out?\u201d\nCustomers go to Movie Place to be part of this banter, but they will not be doing so for much longer. Faced with a large rent increase, Mr. Dennis plans to close his 22-year-old shop on Nov. 30. \nSuch closings are increasingly common in New York and around the country. Like the movie theaters that preceded them, video stores are fast becoming relics, and their signs may soon join those unlighted movie marquees (with a vestigial letter or two) that dot various neighborhoods and remind passers-by of what once was. \nBut the decline of the video store is more than a story of small merchants undone by technological change. Like movie theaters, and unlike delis or drugstores, video shops in a city as film-saturated and film-savvy as New York emerged as centers of neighborhood life. \nTheir selections mirror the people they serve, and their proprietors, like Mr. Dennis, can be beloved figures with a deep knowledge not only of local inhabitants\u2019 film tastes, but also of other aspects of their lives. \n\u201cI came in here once, and I said, \u2018My husband just got his teeth pulled,\u2019 \u201d said Maxine McClintock, a longtime Movie Place customer. \u201c\u2018What\u2019s a good movie to watch when your teeth are pulled?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Dennis recommended some screwball comedies, including \u201cLibeled Lady,\u201d a 1936 film with Spencer Tracy, William Powell and Myrna Loy.\n Salvatore Ierardo, the liquidation director for Video One Liquidators, a Florida company that sells off video stores\u2019 inventories on site, sees the deaths of these shops firsthand. The stores are like \u201cthe guy that used to deliver ice,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cHe worked hard and everything, but the refrigerator was working while he was sleeping.\u201d As for customers\u2019 reaction to the demise, Mr. Ierardo said: \u201cThey know it\u2019s inevitable, but they don\u2019t feel comfortable. They know it\u2019s been there a long time standing.\u201d \nMom-and-Pops in Peril\n The final scene in the story of Movie Place began last April, when its building was sold. Mr. Dennis had no lease, and his new landlord, Ralph Braha, offered him one at a monthly rent of $7,500, more than double what he was paying. Jay Litzman, a lawyer for Mr. Braha, said in an interview, \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a commercial setting and you don\u2019t have a lease and someone takes over, you expect that the market will be reached.\u201d \nIn the middle of last month, Mr. Dennis decided to fold his hand and close his store by Dec. 1. He does not plan to open a new one; business is too sluggish these days, he said, and his heart isn\u2019t in it. \n\u201cStarting again would be like going back to an old girlfriend,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d always be second-guessing myself.\u201d\nCompared with some other video stores, Movie Place has not fared badly. For years, it resisted the forces that have been sweeping away many of the city\u2019s other mom-and-pop video shops. Nationally, the number of privately owned video rental shops, as opposed to huge chains, fell to roughly 13,000 in 2005 from about 22,000 in 1996, according to Tom Adams, president of Adams Media Research, which tracks the entertainment industry. \nThe mom-and-pops were weakened by the rise of chains like Blockbuster, Hollywood Video and Movie Gallery, which together added almost 5,000 stores between 1996 and 2004, striking deals with the studios that gave them dozens of low-priced copies of hot new releases. Then the independents were buffeted by the arrival of cheap DVDs for sale, now a $16-billion-a-year business, along with the rise of Netflix and on-demand cable movies. \nThese trends have been especially harmful in New York, where rising rents are imperiling many small-margin businesses anyway. For New York, the list of casualties includes not only single-store video businesses but also small chains that have scaled back sharply or folded: Royal Video, Captain Video, Champagne Video. \nMr. Ierardo, the liquidation director, gets a knowing look from browsers when he is selling off a New York video store. \u201cSome people walk in and go, \u2018The rent, right?\u2019 \u201d he said. \n In any event, the decline of these shops has left New York\u2019s many film lovers increasingly adrift. Until 2001, for example, the cognoscenti could hunt for Iranian or Bangladeshi films in the International Film and Video Center, an East Side store run by an Iranian film scholar. Until the mid-\u201990s, they could browse the sliding shelves at Video Shack, a pioneering sales-and-rental emporium near Times Square. Video Shack was such an early entrant to the business that it was selling videotapes before many customers knew what they were. \n\u201cPeople would come in one day, buy a video and then two days later, they\u2019d bring it back because it didn\u2019t fit in their television,\u201d recalled the former owner, Arthur Morowitz. \u201cWe had actually out-marketed the VCR.\u201d\nThe Corner Film Critic\nThe proprietors of many of the city\u2019s video stores often became film critics of last resort. North Heights Video in Brooklyn Heights, a defunct outlet run by the wry, hyper-opinionated Martin Arno, had a vast selection of obscure and foreign films (anyone for \u201cWhite Hell of Pitz Palu\u201d a 1929 silent about German mountaineering?). Mr. Arno was known to favor Hitchcock over Bergman. \u201cI watch a Bergman film,\u201d he once said, \u201cand I want to jump off a bridge.\u201d \nMr. Dennis of Movie Place, who named his 7-year-old daughter, Ava, in honor of Ava Gardner, has probably never been asked a film-related question he cannot answer. Once, a woman who was leaving her husband at home for the weekend asked Mr. Dennis, \u201cWhat are the movies he\u2019d want to watch that I\u2019d hate?\u201d Mr. Dennis\u2019s recommendations: \u201cU-571,\u201d a 2000 submarine thriller set during World War II, and \u201cThe Seven-Ups,\u201d a 1973 police drama. \n But the influence works both ways, with some shops coming to resemble their neighborhoods over the years, much as people and their pets are said to grow to look like each other.\nWorld of Video, still operating on Greenwich Avenue in the still heavily gay West Village, is known for its gay and lesbian collection. At Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que in Park Slope, the large number of local writers had a hand in determining what was on the shelves. Paul Auster, the novelist, repeatedly requested \u201cIn a Lonely Place,\u201d a 1950 Humphrey Bogart movie about a hot-tempered screenwriter. Eventually, he got his wish. \nChannel Video, on Columbus Avenue on the Upper West Side, was shaped by its neighborhood of upscale cinephiles, people with highbrow but not obscure tastes. \u201cHe had gathered a collection of art-house movies and Criterion DVDs and things the customers wanted,\u201d Mr. Ierardo said of David Cohn, the proprietor. \u201cThey\u2019d ask for something, he\u2019d buy it.\u201d \nVideo stores are woven into the local fabric in other ways. A couple once asked Mr. Dennis if they could get married in his store. (He said no.) Some couples, among them Mr. Dennis and his wife, first met in the aisles. And last June, Mr. Dennis persuaded the city to give the name Humphrey Bogart Place to the block of 103rd Street west of Broadway, because the actor spent his early years there. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to live without it,\u201d John Reaves, a Movie Place patron, said the other day as he signed a petition to keep the store open. The petition was drafted by a local family, the Telushkins. Mr. Dennis was dubious about the petition\u2019s chances of success, but that did not keep Benjamin Telushkin, a 13-year-old Fellini fan, from sitting at a card table down the street with a giant oaktag sign and shouting, \u201cSave Movie Place!\u201d\nThe Frustrated 2,500\n The Upper West Side is suffering through a spasm of late-stage gentrification, with many of its restaurants, shops and grocers replaced by bank branches and chain drugstores. Mr. Dennis himself drew loud applause at a meeting of Community Board 7 this month when he declared: \u201cOur neighborhood is becoming a punch line. You walk down Broadway, and it\u2019s a Flintstones background: Duane Reade, wireless place, Duane Reade, wireless place.\u201d\n Upper West Siders are particularly protective of all their institutions, but the demise of Movie Place seems to have touched a raw neighborhood nerve. With the help of his mother, Devorah, and sisters, Shira and Naomi, Benjamin Telushkin gathered 2,500 signatures on their petition. \nSuch local affection surfaced a few weeks ago when Matt Unger and Stephanie Ehrlich, the couple who had asked to be married at Movie Place, arrived at the store. They had just learned that it was closing. \nGrimacing, Mr. Unger said, \u201cThat\u2019s one of these things that make you not want to live in New York anymore.\u201d \nMs. Ehrlich looked at her husband. \u201cWhat\u2019s Gary going to do?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. Unger replied. \u201cHe seems to only be good at one thing.\u201d\nIn fact, Mr. Dennis is making plans to sell off his inventory, perhaps to an online service. The only movies he wants to keep are \u201cCasablanca,\u201d \u201cA Night at the Opera\u201d and \u201cOrchestra Wives,\u201d a Glenn Miller musical. As for the rest, he said: \u201cWhere are you going to keep it? My wife invented that phrase \u2014 \u2018Oh, you\u2019re going to buy it? Where are you going to keep it?\u2019 New York\u2019s different.\u201d Besides, he added, \u201cthis stuff\u2019ll show up on TV.\u201d\nHe spends part of every day fielding condolence calls, at least two dozen on a recent Monday. \u201cI\u2019m available for parties and bar mitzvahs,\u201d he told one caller. Then, more gravely, he added: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m chained to this neighborhood. They\u2019re going to bury me in Straus Park when the time comes.\u201d After shutting the store, Mr. Dennis may set up a movie Web site or, fittingly, write a book about defunct movie theaters.\nOne of the store\u2019s final visitors was Karen Young, an actress who plays an F.B.I. agent in \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and a romantic rival of Charlotte Rampling\u2019s in the 2006 film \u201cHeading South.\u201d Ms. Young, who lives two blocks from the store, raised her two children on slapstick Laurel and Hardy rented from Mr. Dennis, and she was shocked to hear of the closing. \u201cYou know how hard those are to find?\u201d she said of those \u201930s comedies. \u201cThis is awful.\u201d\n\u201cYou can buy most of those on DVD now,\u201d Mr. Dennis said in a kind voice. Then he paused for a second. \u201cNot the shorts.\u201d",

    "text": "Cambodia Tries Nonprofit Path to Health Care\n2006-01-08T05:00:00.000Z\nCorrection Appended\nREAP, Cambodia - Sovan Sna had been in labor all night long. By the 16th hour of contractions, she was in trouble. The baby, her first, was not coming out. And she was so exhausted and in such pain she could barely speak.\nHer mind churned with fear. In the Khmer language, this most treacherous passage in a woman's life -- childbirth -- is called crossing the river. Her aunt had died giving birth to a first child who perished in the womb. Mrs. Sna wondered if she and her baby, too, would drown before reaching the other shore.\nNot long ago, Mrs. Sna would have had little choice but to give birth at home, like her aunt, and risk both her life and her baby's. But on this morning, Mrs. Sna's terrified husband hired a pony cart and was able to take his wife over a deeply rutted dirt road to a small, no-frills public hospital.\nIf childbirth is a miracle of nature, then the thriving, honestly run network of clinics and hospitals here is a human marvel, managed not by the government but by one of the nonprofit groups it has hired to run entire public health districts.\nThe approach is catching on in a growing number of poor countries around the world, from Bangladesh and Afghanistan to Congo and Rwanda, to Bolivia and Guatemala, reaching tens of millions of people.\nThese contracted services have allowed international donors and concerned governments to cut through dysfunctional bureaucracies -- or work around them, and to improve health care and efficiency at modest cost.\nHere in Cambodia, the nonprofit groups -- all of them international -- are instilling discipline and clarity of purpose in a health care system enfeebled by corruption, absenteeism and decades of war and upheaval. They have introduced incentives to draw Cambodia's own doctors and nurses back into the system. Patients, especially the poorest ones, have followed in droves.\n\"All the evidence is that this worked very well in a situation where nothing much else worked very well,\" said Shyam Bajpai, the representative here for the Asian Development Bank, which financed the original contracts.\nCambodia's health care system is still recovering from the traumas of the murderous reign of the Khmer Rouge, which in the 1970's singled out the educated for slaughter, decimating the ranks of medical professionals. Decades of war that completely drew to a close only in 1998 destroyed hospitals and deepened poverty.\nToday international donors provide about two-thirds of the public spending on health and over the years have financed the construction of hundreds of hospitals and clinics. But money and buildings alone were not enough to overcome a bureaucratic culture afflicted by favoritism and lackadaisical accountability.\nThe Health Ministry began testing the use of contractors in 1999. Then, the main hospital in the Pearaing district was a crumbling shell. It had fallen so far into disuse that termite mounds rose on the broken tile floors and farm animals rooted in the yard, chewing on mangy bits of grass.\n\"We saw more cows than patients,\" said Sopha Sum, a nurse then assigned to the hospital.\nSix years after the main hospital was turned over to Health Net International, based in the Netherlands, Pearaing's hospitals and clinics now see thousands of patients a week. In just the first nine months of 2005, more than half the district's 200,000 people sought care.\nAnd the government and donors are spending only $4 a year per person on health care in the district -- what a couple of aspirin tablets would cost in many American hospitals.\nThe five nongovernmental organizations running parts of the health system, Health Net and Save the Children Australia, among them, are paid based on their performance in improving services, like childhood immunizations and the proportion of women getting prenatal care and delivering babies in a health center. With additional support from the British and the World Bank, the government recently expanded the approach to cover one in 10 Cambodians.\nDistricts managed by the nongovernmental organizations have been much more successful in improving health services than districts run by the government, a World Bank study found, though both have made progress. The study randomly assigned districts to be managed by nonprofits, or by the government, then measured results through household surveys conducted in 1997 and 2003.\n\"There were fantastic improvements,\" said Michael Kremer, a Harvard economist.\nThose changes did not happen overnight. For years, Dr. Fred Griffiths, the 54-year old Pakistani who runs the Pearaing district for Health Net, said he saw most of his operating budget from the Cambodian government skimmed off as it made its way through layers of bureaucracy.\nSao Chhorn, who then monitored the contracted districts for the Health Ministry, said officials simply took the money through various corrupt practices. \"At least 40 percent of the budget just disappears,\" said Mr. Chhorn, who now works for a management consulting firm. \"And this is the best situation. In the worst situation, almost all of it disappears.\"\nDr. Griffiths found himself in the worst of situations. A trim man with a neatly clipped mustache and a no-nonsense style, he did not take it quietly. \"We screamed at workshops and conferences, wherever there was a forum,\" he said.\nLast year, to his relief, the government began transferring the funds directly from the national treasury to the contractors, bypassing potential layers of graft.\nBut his toughest job was motivating the staff. Dr. Griffiths realized he would never get the system functioning unless he could improve the health workers' earnings.\nThe government paid poverty wages: $20 a month to a doctor, $15 for a nurse. The staff pocketed the paltry government salaries and spent almost all their time operating private practices. Not surprisingly, there were almost no patients at the district hospital in Snay Pol, a bone-rattling three-hour drive from the capital, Phnom Penh.\nSokong Lim, 34, then a paramedic, said he saw only two patients come for treatment in the two years before Health Net arrived. But he also admitted that he was usually working at his own clinic near a ferry crossing on the Mekong River.\n\"Nobody was willing to work at that time,\" he said. \"Even the chief of the hospital had his own business. Nobody blamed anybody.\"\nThe hospital itself was like a stolen car stripped of its parts. Dr. Griffiths said the equipment had simply disappeared, probably into the staff members' private practices. Thermometers, stethoscopes, speculums, obstetrical instruments -- all were missing.\nDr. Griffiths decided to use part of his contracting budget to supplement his staff's pay. Pearaing also introduced small fees, charging 25 cents to see a doctor and 75 cents for a day's stay at the hospital.\nHealth Net used the revenues to bolster the staff's incomes, paying for incentives for punctuality and reaching targets to immunize children, and generally instilling a culture of accountability. Despite grumbling, most of the staff gave up their side jobs to work full-time and provide 24-hour coverage.\nNurses now earn $60 to $200 a month depending on their qualifications and performance, while doctors make $200 to $250.\nBecause the district's fees are much lower than those charged by the drug sellers, quacks and government doctors who used to operate private practices, peasants have flocked to the public clinics and hospitals. Health Net covers the hospital costs of the poor, about 40 percent of the patients, out of its contracting budget.\nOne recent afternoon, the beds at the hospital in Snay Pol were filled with peoplesuffering from the kinds of easily treated illnesses that kill millions in developing countries each year.\nSory Ros, a 45-year-old mother of eight, had gotten her 10-month-old twins, Boramey and Bon, to the hospital on an arduous, five-hour journey that began on a boat slipping through a rice field at dawn, continued on a bumpy horse cart and finished on a motorbike.\nThe babies, coughing and listless, had two potentially mortal ailments: diarrhea and acute respiratory infections. The mother watched anxiously as intravenous drips replaced their lost fluids, preventing their deaths from dehydration.\nThe hospital under Health Net's management has gradually won people's trust. Not least, the district's newfound credibility, as well as the 24-hour availability of qualified midwives and doctors, has transformed childbirth habits across this rural landscape.\nAs far back as anyone can remember, the women here in the village of Reap have depended only on traditional birth attendants -- village women with no formal medical training -- to bring babies into the world. But now more than half the women in the district give birth in a health center, compared with less than 10 percent in Cambodia.\n\"All our parents delivered at home,\" said Mrs. Sna's husband, Veasna Van. \"Now, nobody does. We believe the health care center can save lives if there is a problem.\"\nMrs. Sna's birth attendant, Min Heng, 50, agreed. \"I have only my empty hands,\" she explained.\nHealth Net turned women like Mrs. Heng into some of its best recruiters. It pays the clinic an extra $20 for every woman who gives birth there. The clinic, in turn, pays the attendants a bonus of $1.25 for each woman in labor they bring in, more than the 75 cents a family typically pays the attendant for delivering the baby by herself.\nWith Mrs. Heng assisting at the clinic, the midwife began to worry that Mrs. Sna's labor had reached a standstill and decided she should be taken to the hospital in Snay Pol, where surgeons and better equipment were available.\nPhat Yim, a pony cart driver who has built a good business getting women to the hospital, pulled in at the clinic. He filled his wooden cart with straw and lay a mat on top of it. Mr. Van gently picked up his wife and placed her in the cart. Her face crumpled when yet another contraction seized her belly.\nAs the cart jounced through the emerald green paddy fields along a road cratered by the monsoons, Mrs. Sna moaned, her husband rubbed her lower back and Mrs. Heng rested her hand on Mrs. Sna's hip.\nA half hour later, they trotted up to the maternity ward at the hospital. Dr. Sorny Kong hustled into the birthing room. She started Mrs. Sna on a sugar drip to give her a bit of a lift, got out the vacuum extractor -- operated with a foot pedal -- and attached the suction cup to the crown of the baby's head. A half hour later, a healthy boy emerged into the world.\nMoments later, Mrs. Sna lay on a bed in a row of new mothers, her baby swaddled beside her, a luminous smile on her face.\nCorrection: February 9, 2006, Thursday An article on Jan. 8 about the Cambodian government's contracts with nonprofit groups to manage public health districts referred incorrectly to remarks by a former official who said corruption consumed much of the money budgeted for health care. The former official, Sao Chhorn, has notified the writer that he was referring to developments before nonprofit groups took over, not after.",

    "text": "'The Ruling Caste'\n2006-04-30T05:00:00.000Z\n During their brief momentous period of collaboration, Joseph Stalin and Joachim von Ribbentrop agreed that it was absurd that so much of the world should be ruled by Great Britain. In particular, the Russian leader told the Nazi Foreign Minister, it was 'ridiculous ... that a few hundred Englishmen should dominate India'. He was referring to the men of the Indian Civil Service (ICS). \n\n The statistic alone seems ridiculous. In 1901, when Queen Victoria died, the 'few hundred' numbered just over a thousand, of whom a fifth were at any time either sick or on leave. Yet they administered directly (in British India) or indirectly (in the princely states) a population of nearly 300 million people spread over the territory of modern India, Pakistan, Burma and Bangladesh. \n Stalin's grumble contained perhaps a touch of tacit admiration. More explicit praise came from earlier foreign leaders who, like him, had been in search of empires to rule. Bismarck thought Britain's work in India would be 'one of its lasting monuments', while Theodore Roosevelt told the British they had done 'such marvellous things in India' that they might 'gradually, as century succeeds century ... transform the Indian population, not in blood, probably not in speech, but in government and culture, and thus leave [their] impress as Rome did hers on Western Europe'. \n It is not difficult to find foreign eulogies of British civil servants in India, from the French AbbA\u0303\u00a9 Dubois, who in 1822 extolled their 'uprightness of character, education and ability', to the Austrian Baron HA\u03031\u20444bner who in 1886 ascribed the 'miracles' of British administration to 'the devotion, intelligence, the courage, the perseverance, and the skill combined with an integrity proof against all temptation, of a handful of officials and magistrates who govern and administer the Indian Empire'. Similar tributes can also be found in unexpected places in Britain. Lloyd George, the Liberal leader, lauded the Service as 'the steel frame' that held everything together, while John Strachey, the Labour minister, judged it the 'least corruptible ... ablest and ... most respectable of all the great bureaucracies of the world'. \n The same words recur again and again, even from Indian nationalists and their newspapers at the end of the nineteenth century: impartial, high-minded, conscientious, incorruptible. The ICS may have had its critics-even within its own ranks-but about its elevated standards there was no argument. N.B. Bonarjee, a member of the Service but also an Indian nationalist, praised 'its rectitude, its sense of justice, its tolerance, its sense of public duty', as well as 'its high administrative ability'. After independence in 1947, the new nations of Pakistan and India each displayed pride in its traditions. While in Karachi a Government pamphlet proclaimed that the Pakistan Civil Service was the 'successor' of the ICS, 'the most distinguished Civil Service in the world', in Delhi the Home Minister, Vallabhbhai Patel, used it as a model for the Indian Administrative Service, a body that played a crucial role in the integration and unification of the new state. Even at the beginning of the twenty-first century retired members of the IAS were recalling the exploits of their British predecessors with almost embarrassing effusiveness. \n The high reputation of the ICS was never reflected in the literature of the country where most of its members were born. This was no doubt partly because civil servants do not make exciting characters in fiction, even when they do much of their work on horseback. During the existence of the Raj they sometimes appeared in the novels of largely forgotten authors such as Alexander Allardyce, Flora Annie Steel, W. W. Hunter, Edward Thompson and A. E. W. Mason. More recently they have featured in the fiction of three winners of the Booker Prize, although not in any leading role except in J. G. Farrell's The Siege of Krishnapur, a historical novel about the Indian Mutiny. In Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's Heat and Dust the civil servant is a hapless figure whose wife has an affair with the local nawab, while in Paul Scott's The Jewel in the Crown he is an uncomfortable liberal who disavows his predecessors and is limited to a brief appearance in a single volume of the Raj Quartet. \n Scott's work, criticized both by Indian nationalists and by British conservatives, is a brilliant portrait of the Raj in its closing years. Yet it is limited not only in time but also in the range of its British characters, who (apart from some missionaries) are nearly all connected to the Army. Rudyard Kipling painted a fuller and richer picture of the Raj at its zenith, but this too is restricted in scope, mainly because he lived nearly all his time in the Punjab and left India at the age of 23. He also took most of his characters from the military (with a preference for NCOs and Other Ranks), and distributed his civilians in professions as diverse as forestry and engineering. Some of Kipling's few civil servants are strong men, dedicated paternalists obsessed with duty and the welfare of Indians. But others are pedantic or frivolous or impractical. In his story 'Tod's Amendment' he gave a 6-year-old boy more understanding of agricultural tenancies than the Legal Member of the Viceroy's Council. \n Although Kipling was the principal chronicler of British India, the most enduring effigy of its administrators was carved by E. M. Forster in A Passage to India. The two writers approached the Subcontinent from angles that could hardly have been more different. Kipling was born in India and returned at the age of 16 to earn his living as a journalist in Lahore. Forster had already published most of his novels by the time he sailed for Bombay in search of India and Indian friendships. There was nothing in his background, character or outlook that predisposed him to look favourably on the Raj. Indeed several of his friends in the Bloomsbury Group had abandoned their traditional family links with imperial rule. They even persuaded one of their members, Rex Partridge, the son and nephew of ICS officials, to change his name to the less regal-sounding Ralph. \nA Passage to India is a subtle and in certain ways sensitive work, a well-crafted drama with an evocative sense of place and some plausible Indian characters. But its author's loathing of the British in India-a feeling he confessed to in private-turned it into a tendentious political novel, at any rate for many of his contemporary readers. Kipling was fascinated by other men's professions and wrote numerous stories about work; so was Scott, who diligently carried out research into how the British had administered India. But Forster was seldom interested in writing about work; he preferred portraying people at their leisure or in their domesticity in Florence and the Home Counties. He did not see civil servants inspecting hospitals or canals but witnessed them relaxing at 'the Club', where he judged them philistine and stupid. Then he turned them into caricatures. His District Officer, Turton, is pompous and absurd and wants 'to flog every native' in sight as soon as there is a crisis; his memsahibs are even worse, crude stereotypes, compounds of nothing but snobbery and racial prejudice. Their actions are seldom more credible than their characters. Forster makes them react to an obscure incident in a cave as if it had been a minor massacre. They gather at the club and make semi-hysterical suggestions about calling out the Army, 'clearing the bazaars' and sending the women and children to the hills. There is almost nothing believable about the scene at the club or about the arrest and trial of Aziz, where Forster's ignorance of administration and judicial procedure let him down again. Yet these events, described in fiction and depicted in film, form one of the most abiding images of British India. \n The principal historical portrait is a kinder one. Fifty years ago, a former civil servant, Philip Mason, published (under the pseudonym Philip Woodruff) his two volumes of The Men Who Ruled India, The Founders and The Guardians. They are the work of a wise man and a talented writer who wrote affectionately yet sometimes critically of a Service which had on the whole, he thought, justified its reputation for altruism and benevolent rule. Although regularly and unfairly denounced by post-colonial critics as hagiography, it is the work on the subject best known to non-academic readers. \n \n Two historiograpical developments in the late 1970s changed academic attitudes towards the Service. The most important was the publication in 1978 of Edward Said's Orientalism, a hugely influential book that spawned legions of disciples, in India and elsewhere, who took it for granted that colonial rule was always evil and colonialist motives were invariably bad. The other was a sudden interest shown by a number of North American historians in demolishing the reputation of the ICS. In 1976 Bradford Spangenberg published a thesis claiming that the Service was obsessed with status and promotion and declaring that, as a result of his 'scrutiny of the characteristics and motivations of British officials', he had destroyed the 'myths' of its efficiency and 'self-sacrificial esprit de corps'. Although his 'scrutiny' generally and curiously eschewed the examination of civil servants' private papers, it was welcomed by other historians equally eager to demonstrate the self-interest and lack of altruism in the Service. It soon became normal to read American studies of British India without finding a decent motive ascribed to officials who had spent a good part of their careers digging canals, fighting crime and organizing famine relief. Even the officers of the Indian Medical Service, men working (with a certain success) to combat malaria, plague and cholera, were accused of carrying out research 'driven by narrowly professional motives' and of trying 'to advance their careers at home by contributing to the advance of a universal medical science'. 10 How contributions to the advance of medical science can be regarded as inherently sinful is something of a mystery. Even odder is the implication that trying to advance one's career is an activity unknown to American historians. \n The most significant contributions to the subject since Woodruff are The District Officer by Roland Hunt and John Harrison, which is outside my period, and Clive Dewey's Anglo-Indian Attitudes, which just touches the end of it. Dewey's study concentrates on two very different figures in the ICS, Malcolm Darling, a friend of Forster who also befriended Indians, and Frank Lugard Brayne, an Evangelical who attempted to transform his district by enforcing sanitary and agricultural improvements. The author took the two men to represent the Cult of Friendship and the Gospel of Uplift, two contrasting outlooks which, he argued, alternated as the dominant British attitude to India between the governorship of Clive and the viceroyalty of Mountbatten. \n Paul Scott became so interested in the mechanics of the Raj that he even contemplated writing a non-fictional account of its working routines. He wished that the last British generation in India would stop reminiscing about tigers and elephants and the smell of dung fires, and tell him how their curious administration had functioned. 'How did it work?' There was 'nothing more maddening', he told a retired civil servant, 'than the lack of printed evidence of how men like you actually spent their day. From chota bazri to sundown. Minute by minute, hour by hour.' \n This book does not pretend to explain how the administration worked. That would require a study not only of Stalin's 'few hundred' but of the hundreds of thousands of Indian subordinates who were employed in the various different services. But it does aim to show what the senior men did, how they worked and how they lived from chota bazri to sundown, from apprenticeship to the Collector's bungalow and, in some cases, to Simla and Government House. It takes them from background and recruitment through their careers to their retirement; it describes their work and their ambitions, their thoughts and their beliefs, their leisure time and their domestic existences. I have attempted to explain why they went to India, what they did when they got there, and what they thought about it all. While mindful of recent post-colonial scholarship, I have tried to be unprejudiced in assessing their strengths and weaknesses, their successes and failures. If I have been incapable of doing so without irony, I hope at least that I have been fair. \n My approach has been an individual's on individuals, coming to the institution through its members, not the other way round. That is why some sections deal exclusively with a single official, notably Alfred Lyall, whose life is chronicled from training to retirement. I began doing research on the ICS fifteen years ago, while working on a biography of Lord Curzon, and since then I have come across hundreds of people writing or being written about in private papers. The experience has led me to appreciate the diversity within the structure. Despite my admiration for Dewey's work, I find that few of the people I have investigated fit comfortably into one or other of his categories: most of them have bits of both Darling and Brayne. \n No doubt this view places me in Dewey's categories of 'unreconstructed liberal' or empiricist who denies the importance of ideologies and the Zeitgeist. Of course I am aware that there was a civil service ethos imbibed at Haileybury or Oxford and later reinforced in the provincial capitals of Bombay, Lahore and elsewhere. Similar ideas percolated in the clubs and in the secretariats. But always there was the diversity encouraged by diverse circumstances. The experience of Madras was very different from that of the Punjab; men in obscure districts did not see things in the same way as their colleagues in Calcutta. Ultimately officials in India had to live on their own resources, their lives determined by individual temperaments, environment and experience- and by the eternal problems of human relationships. . . . \n\n",

    "text": "Translation: Is the Whole World Watching?\n2006-03-26T05:00:00.000Z\n\"HOW you see something,\" said Nigel Parsons, the managing director of Al Jazeera International, \"depends very much on where you're sitting.\"\nThose words could well serve as the manifesto for the channel, the English-language offspring of the polarizing pan-Arab network, which will make its debut in more than 40 million households in late May.\nAddressing hundreds of journalists and academics who had come to Doha, Qatar, for the second Al Jazeera Forum, Mr. Parsons promised that the new channel -- with its headquarters there and broadcast centers in Washington, London and Kuala Lumpur -- will cover the stories and people that the Western-owned news media overlook. \"We're not going to be another CNN, BBC or Sky,\" he told the attendees on the last day of January. \"If we were, there'd be no point.\" But, he added, \"It's not our position to tell viewers what to think.\"\nDuring a freewheeling question-and-answer session, the audience pressed him for details. With costs already surpassing a billion dollars, Al Jazeera is the most ambitious television network start-up in recent years. Will it be the first network to crack the Western monopoly on delivering news and opinion to a global audience? Will it provide an Arab and Muslim point of view to the rest of the world?\nMany at the forum hoped it would. But its top management is British, and its high-profile hires -- like the smooth interviewer David Frost and the former \"Nightline\" correspondent Dave Marash -- are hardly representative of the developing world. Will it then, the journalists wanted to know, just be colonialism in more modern garb?\nOutside of that crowded conference room, the pressure is just as great. In the Arab world, Al Jazeera has a reputation for tackling the thorny issues. But in the United States, where it is best known for showing tapes of Osama Bin Laden's tirades, one person's fearless reporting can quickly become another's dangerous propaganda. And the more widely it is viewed as a terrorist mouthpiece, the harder a time the channel will have getting a spot on the already-crowded American cable line-ups.\nMr. Parsons understands the need to reassure new viewers in the West without disappointing old ones in the Arab world. \"Essentially, it's about getting the balance right,\" he said.\nA little more than five minutes from the 1980's-era opulence of the vast Sheraton on the Doha's corniche -- if the traffic-clogged roundabouts thoughtfully bequeathed by the British do not double the commute time -- lies the headquarters of the Al Jazeera networks. To describe the exterior as nondescript would be giving the dusty compound of squat buildings and satellite transponders too much credit. But inside, another story unfolds.\nThe Arabic-channel's new newsroom, which opened last year, is an airy space filled with Aeron chairs, slick flat-screen LG and Samsung monitors and on-air sets whose color scheme (orangey green) morphs through the day. Next door, in a former parking lot, swarms of men in smocks -- imported cheap labor from Southeast Asia -- hurry to complete the English-language headquarters.\nEmployees at Al Jazeera International boast of having one of the largest plasma screens of any newsroom in the world. From the newsroom on the first floor, a glass spiral staircase will lead to a mezzanine of open-plan news desks for the Web site and glass-walled offices, a rarity in the Arab world, where executive suites are more often clubby, private affairs. A fiber-optic network will connect Doha to its broadcast centers and other bureaus. There will also be a prayer room, as is customary in Qatari workplaces. Over all, it's a far cry from the tiny newsroom of the channel's early years, the one that prompted the Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak to marvel during a 2000 visit, \"All this trouble from a matchbox like this.\"\nAl Jazeera's rapid growth over the last decade is primarily the doing of one man, the emir of Qatar, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani. Since bloodlessly overthrowing his father in 1995, Sheik Hamad has overseen the vast natural gas reserves of his country, a sandy spit of land about the size of Connecticut and Rhode Island combined that juts out of Saudi Arabia into the Persian Gulf.\nBut those reserves will not last forever, so he has used the profits to diversify. He has opened Qatar to the West, turning it into a regional education hub, setting off a building boom and loosening some political restrictions. In 1996, he issued a decree establishing Al Jazeera, and then bankrolled its first five years with a grant of $137 million. He is still footing the bulk of the channel's annual budget.\n\"He's thinking long-term,\" said Hugh Miles, the author of \"Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel That is Challenging the West\" (Grove Press). In a rough neighborhood, he wants to build \"an Arab version of Switzerland -- rich, neutral and secure,\" Mr. Miles said.\nMahmud Shammam, the Washington bureau chief of Al Watan newspaper and Newsweek in Arabic, as well as the emir's latest addition to Al Jazeera's board of directors, said Sheik Hamad hoped the network would be a countervailing force to some of the political and social trends in the Middle East. \"He wants Al Jazeera to be a force for democracy and modernization in the Arab world,\" Mr. Shammam said.\nCertainly the region has not been a haven for the free press. Owned or controlled by the state, the television channels in the region are often filled with dreary state receptions and handshakes of smiling kings and autocratic generals, breaking-news bulletins of the queen's latest ribbon cutting, and an avoidance of anything remotely controversial.\nBut since its debut in November 1996, Al Jazeera has offended multitudes with news and commentary that do not necessarily conform to the views of mullahs or kings. To the outrage of social conservatives, the host of a religion show said the Koran did not forbid fellatio. Guests have questioned the right of the Saud family to rule Saudi Arabia. At some time or another, nearly every country in the Middle East -- save Israel -- has banned or curtailed its reporters.\nMeanwhile Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has accused the network of \"vicious lies\" and of promoting an anti-American worldview. (An Al Jazeera journalist in Spain was sentenced last year in that country to seven years in prison for collaborating with Al Qaeda; Al Jazeera is appealing the verdict.)\nThe reality of what is on the channel is more nuanced. (See sidebar.) Just as the emir and Qatar play host to the American military while offering asylum to Saddam Hussein's wife, Al Jazeera offers a showcase for dissenting views -- such as Dr. Wafa Sultan, an Arab-American psychiatrist who recently denounced some Muslims for what she called their backwardness -- but a definite worldview dominates, one that is pro-Palestinian and skeptical of the West's intentions. Particularly America's intentions, post 9/11. Recently the administration has chosen to engage more with the channel; American officials, such as Condoleezza Rice, have occasionally appeared as guests.\n\"Al Jazeera has played a very important role in creating foundations for democracy and pluralism in the Middle East,\" said Marc Lynch, an associate professor of political science at Williams College and the author of \"Voices of a New Arab Public: Iraq, Al Jazeera and a Middle East Politics Today\" (Columbia University Press). \"It can also fan the flame of populism and anti-Americanism. And there's an ongoing struggle between these two forces.\"\nDealing with that struggle falls to Mr. Parsons, as he sets out to convince cable and satellite operators, politicians and curious prospective viewers that Al Jazeera International will not be biased against the West, but will nonetheless offer a needed alternative to CNN International and BBC World.\nThe son of a British military officer, Mr. Parsons, 54, grew up in countries like Singapore and Malaysia, and has spent 30 years working for news outlets ranging from BBC Radio to Associated Press Television News. When he was first approached about the position at Al Jazeera International, he was frustrated with the tenor of most English-language news. \"Especially the coverage of the Iraqi invasion,\" he said. \"Somehow it seemed to me that the Fourth Estate had got into bed with the third estate and the rest of us had been left outside the bedroom. So when this came along, it was blank sheet of paper and a chance to make a difference, and to do things differently.\"\nThe new English-language channel will have all of the standard accoutrements: interview programs, panels of political experts and critiques of the news media. \"Frost Over the World,\" for example, will showcase Mr. Frost's one-on-one skills with global newsmakers each Friday.\nBut Al Jazeera's main business program has the far-from-Wall-Street title \"People and Power,\" and its host, a former Economist correspondent, Dr. Shereen El Feki, pledges to cover the \"grassroots\" along with the executive suites. And \"Witness,\" the channel's daily documentary series out of London, will feature the films as well as conversations with their makers.\nAnd though Al Jazeera International's competitors have also laid claim to the think globally, act locally mentality (and dispute that Western ownership leads to Western-centric newscasts), the new channel is turning the idea into a physical reality. Its broadcasting day is expected to begin in Kuala Lumpur, 9 a.m. local time, and over the next four hours the journalists there will drive the report. The following 11 hours will come out of Doha, before the London broadcast center takes the reins for five. Then, for four hours beginning at 4 p.m. on the East Coast of the United States, Washington will gain its measure of control.\nThis setup, Al Jazeera International executives say, will differentiate the channel from its more centralized competitors and ensure that important regional stories do not get overlooked -- as Bangladesh's deadly typhoons did in the aftermath of Hurricane Rita, said Steve Clark, a former Sky News executive who is the new channel's director of news.\nSo do not expect much coverage of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the annual winter home for privileged white men (and Angelina Jolie) that is much adored by the Western news media. \"I don't think we'd have even gone there,\" Mr. Parsons said.\nJust how willingly an international audience will flock to this alternative news channel -- and whether that migration will reward the emir's huge wager -- is unclear. \"People are far more interested in the price of petrol at their local petrol station than they are in probably what's happening in Sudan,\" Mr. Parsons said. \"That's just a fact. But there is a hunger for international news. If you do it through human interest, people will always relate.\"\nThe fact that Al Jazeera International's target audience -- Arab and Asian expatriates, non Arabic-speaking Muslims and news hounds -- is so geographically diffuse only complicates matters. Al Jazeera also faces the same squeeze in the United States as other fledgling cable channels not backed by a media conglomerate: no room at the inn.\nExecutives do not want the channel relegated to a premium tier, as the Arabic-language channel is in this country, available only to subscribers of the Dish Network willing to pay an extra $26 to $40 a month. But mainstream tiers are already crowded, and newer channels devoted to murder mysteries (Sleuth) and conspicuous consumption (Fine Living) can be much more lucrative. And there's another competitor looming; BBC World has said it plans to bring its 24-hour news channel to the United States, and is working with Discovery Communications.\nSo far, Al Jazeera International has not found a cable or satellite provider. The search continues, and the channel says it has received offers across the United States, including a proposal from one major cable operator. And the channel is considering streaming the video over the Internet, so viewers can watch the network on computers. Either way, the emir's largess takes some of the pressure off. \"We'd love to have cable distribution,\" said Lindsay Oliver, the channel's commercial director, \"but it's not going to kill us if we don't.\"\nThe perception that despite the Middle Eastern base, Westerners once again are dictating the news could ultimately pose a much bigger threat to the channel. At the Al Jazeera forum in Doha, some employees of the Arabic-language channel joined the grumbling about the Western tilt in the top ranks.\nThe English-language channel has been filling out its staff with Arab and Muslim journalists, but even so, the complaints continue. \"Does the emir know,\" asked one post on the Friends of Al Jazeera blog, \"his money is being shared around a group of television people who would make Fox News proud? Fellow Arabs in Doha are not amused.\"\nAll told, Al Jazeera International expects to hire more than 500 people, of which more than 150 will be journalists. Although the new channel will be a separate entity, it will share some resources with its Arabic-language sibling, and to build camaraderie between the two staffs, movie nights and dinners have already been held.\nMr. Shammam of Al Watan said that while he understands why language requirements would limit the network's hiring pool, he would like to see more diversity. \"If it is international, it has to be international,\" he said.\nAnd any eventual success of Al Jazeera International will probably not be measured on the bottom line, but on the international battlefield of ideas. \"It has a chance of shifting slightly the agenda-setting decisions made by the media in New York, London and Atlanta,\" said Daoud Kuttab, the director of the Institute of Modern Media at Al Quds University in Ramallah.\nFor the emir of a tiny country striving to show the West \"the real Arab world, the real Muslim world,\" in the words of Mr. Shammam, that may be victory enough.",

    "text": "A Younger India Is Flexing Its Industrial Brawn\n2006-09-01T05:00:00.000Z\nPUNE, India - India's economic advancement no longer rests on telephone call centers and computer programmers.\nAmong villages with thatch-roofed huts and dirt roads on the outskirts of this city in central India, John Deere and LG Electronics have recently built factories turning out tractors and color television sets for sale in India and for export to the United States.\nIn Hazira, in northwestern India, where some residents still rely on camels to carry traders' goods, the Essar Group is making steel to be used for ventilation shafts in Philadelphia, high-rise structural beams in Chicago and car engine mountings in Detroit.\nFor decades, India followed a route to economic development strikingly different from that of countries like Japan, South Korea or China. While its Asian rivals placed their bets on manufacturing and exports, India focused on its domestic economy and grew more slowly with an emphasis on services.\nBut all that is starting to change.\nIndia's annual growth in manufacturing output, at 9 percent and accelerating, is close to catching growth in services, at 10 percent. Exports of manufactured goods to the United States are now rising faster in percentage terms than China's, although from a much smaller base. More than two-thirds of foreign investment in the last year has gone into manufacturing in India, not services.\n\"Saying we are a back office and China is a factory is a backhanded compliment,\" said Kamal Nath, India's minister of commerce and industry. \"It's not really correct.\"\nIndeed, in interviews at 18 Indian factories and other businesses in 10 cities and villages scattered across the length and breadth of the nation, the picture that emerges is of a country being driven by advances in manufacturing to a much brisker pace of economic growth.\nA prime reason India is now developing into the world's next big industrial power is that a number of global manufacturers are already looking ahead to a serious demographic squeeze facing China. Because of China's \"one child\" policy, family sizes have been shrinking there since the 1980's, so fewer young people will be available soon for factory labor.\nIndia is not expected to pass China in total population until 2030. But India will have more young workers aged 20 to 24 by 2013; the International Labor Organization predicts that by 2020, India will have 116 million workers in this age bracket to China's 94 million.\nIndia's young population will also make it a huge and growing market for years to come, while the engineering skills and English skills of its educated elite will make it competitive across a wide range of industries. So even though India remains a difficult place to do business, several multinationals have been placing big bets on India in hopes of taking advantage of this shifting global dynamic.\nGeneral Motors and Motorola are preparing to build plants in western and southern India. Posco of South Korea and Mittal Steel of the Netherlands have each announced plans to erect giant steel mills in eastern India, where Reliance of India will soon construct one of the world's largest coal-fired power plants.\nThey are finding India's labor force well suited to their goals. When LG set out in 2005 to fill 458 assembly line jobs at its factory here at a starting wage of $90 a month, it required that each applicant have at least 15 years of education -- usually high school plus technical college.\nSeeking a young work force, the company decided that no more than 1 percent of the workers could have had any prior work experience. Despite the limitation, 55,000 young people met its criteria for interviews.\n\"In the villages there is little income,\" said Siddu Matheapattu, 24, in between applying sealant to refrigerator frames. \"Here I can earn more.\"\nBy contrast, cities in the export-oriented Guangdong Province in southeastern China raised monthly minimum wages this summer by 18 percent, to $70 to $100 a month, after factories reported that they had one million more jobs than workers to fill them. Factories elsewhere in China face less severe labor shortages, but they also are being forced to raise wages.\nAs India has deregulated its economy, output has gradually accelerated to a growth rate of 8 percent a year, feeding a national euphoria and a few hopes of someday even beating China's annual growth of more than 10 percent.\nPlenty of obstacles remain, however, notably India's weak infrastructure. China invests $7 on roads, ports, electricity and other backbones of a modern economy for every dollar spent by India -- and it shows. Ports here are struggling to handle rising exports, blackouts are frequent and dirt roads are common even in Bangalore, the center of the country's sophisticated computer programming industry.\nPervasive corruption has slowed many efforts to fix these problems. India's labor laws, little changed since they were enacted just after independence in 1947, also continue to discourage companies from hiring workers, by making it very difficult to lay off employees even if a company's fortunes sour or the economy slows.\nStill, a new optimism prevails in India, bordering at times on euphoria.\n\"The Chinese are very good at copying things, but Indians believe in quality work, we believe in meeting pollution norms,\" said S. S. Pathania, the assistant general manager of the Hero Honda motorcycle factory in Gurgaon, 30 miles south of New Delhi. \"I think India will pass China very soon.\"\nAn Unexpected Boom In Manufacturing\nSprawling across more than a square mile next to a gray tidal estuary, the scale of the Essar Group's complex in Hazira is already impressive. Essar has its own port to bring in iron ore and its own large gas-fired power plant for electricity. At the steel mill, giant buckets pour 150 tons of molten metal at a time to form slabs 2 yards wide and up to 10 yards long.\nBut the complex is just starting to grow. Essar is quintupling steel production and pushing forward a sevenfold increase in power generation, most of it for sale to a national grid desperately short of electricity.\nGrowth on that scale, especially in industries like steel and power but also in areas like car parts and household appliances, is what India has long lacked. Industrial production accounts for only a fifth of India's economic output, compared with two-fifths of China's. But this ratio is starting to rise in India as manufacturing, led by exports, grows faster than agriculture and even some service industries.\nUntil recently, legislation effectively barred companies with more than 100 employees from competing in many industries. The laws were intended to protect tiny businesses in villages, often employing women and minorities; high tariffs were placed on imports as well.\nBut a result was hundreds of thousands of businesses too small to be competitive; India lags behind even the impoverished Bangladesh next door in exports of garments, a big creator of jobs for China. The Indian government has responded by narrowing the list of protected industries to 326 categories of goods from 20,000 and has lowered tariffs.\nComparing factories in India to their competitors in China, many of the Indian factories are smaller but some appear more efficient.\nIndia's stronger financial system demands higher interest rates than China's state-owned banks, making it costlier to hold the small mountains of components awaiting assembly that are often seen in Chinese factories. The Confederation of Indian Industry, a national trade group, has also been highly successful in pushing companies to adopt the latest Japanese lean manufacturing techniques.\nThe drawback is that the nation's manufacturing boom, built on higher-quality goods made under more modern conditions than in China, is not likely to create as many factory jobs as India needs.\nThe Essar steel mill, for example, has been replacing old, labor-intensive equipment with more modern gear. \"We were having it all done manually, but because the customers demand very high quality, we have to do it automatically,\" yelled Rajesh Pandita, an Essar manager, over the roar of a house-size machine that was stretching a minivan-size coil of steel back and forth through large rollers until it was little thicker than plastic kitchen wrap.\nThe Whirlpool factory in Pune uses machines, not people, to fold the steel exteriors of refrigerators. It has some of the highest productivity per worker of any Whirlpool factory in the world, with just 208 line workers producing up to 33,000 refrigerators a month.\nLabor laws, however, discourage flexibility. They still ban companies from allowing manufacturing workers to put in more than 54 hours of overtime in a three-month period even if the workers want to earn extra money. Firing workers is extremely difficult.\n\"Companies think twice, 10 times before they hire new people,\" said Sunil Kant Munjal, the chairman of the Hero Group, one of the world's largest manufacturers of inexpensive motorcycles.\nHero in Gurgaon, on the southern outskirts of New Delhi, and its archrival, the Lifan Group in Chongqing, a city in western China, produce comparable motorcycles but the similarity ends there. Hero markets heavily to its domestic market, protected from foreign competition by high import tariffs, while Lifan emphasizes exports.\nWith scant ventilation, Lifan's factories are filled with diesel exhaust as workers test engines and ride finished bikes at breakneck speed out the doors, zigzagging past co-workers. Hero's factory in Gurgaon, where Honda holds a minority stake, has far better safety standards and excellent ventilation.\nThe Lifan factory pays less than $100 a month. The heavily unionized Hero factory pays $150 a month plus bonuses of up to $370 a month; nearly half the workers earn the top bonus, Mr. Pathania said.\nLifan's labor force is quiescent -- would-be organizers of independent labor unions face long jail terms or worse in China. Hero's workers staged a successful nonviolent protest in 2005 to call for more contract workers to be eligible for the bonuses as well.\nBad Roads and Blackouts Take a Toll on Efficiency\nBut the biggest question mark hanging over the rise of manufacturing in India lies in whether the country has enough roads, ports and electricity-generating plants to move huge quantities of goods and power the factories that make them.\nCaptain Abhay Srivastava, an operations manager at India's busiest port, was on duty on a recent afternoon when a phone call suddenly came in from the docks below. An enormous container ship from Qatar needed to slide 35 feet backward along the privately managed dock at the Nhava Sheva port near Mumbai to allow another large vessel to squeeze into the dock in front of it.\nCaptain Srivastava grabbed his white hard hat and dashed for the elevator. As soon as he reached the water's edge, a dozen laborers in orange jumpsuits began straining to arrange a cat's cradle of heavy, five-inch-thick ropes that would allow the ship to use its powerful winches to pull itself out of the way.\n\"They are efficient people; they don't speak a lot,\" said Captain Srivastava, who has visited most of the world's major ports either as a ship captain or for port training exercises. \"You go to some places and they just stand around.\"\nThe efficiency of the Nhava Sheva port -- it approaches West Coast ports in the United States in the number of containers moved per hour -- shows that India is capable of producing world-class facilities.\nBut big as it is, Nhava Sheva is too small to handle the crush of traffic. John Deere tractors wait in a container at the dock for one to four days before being loaded on a ship.\n\"If this pace of growth continues, we will see more congestion at the port,\" said Raj Kalathur, the managing director and chief executive of Deere's operations in India.\nSimilar worries prevail in Chennai, formerly Madras. \"Another four or five years, we'll be choked,\" said M. Rafeeque Ahmed, the chairman of the Farida Group, a 9,000-employee shoe manufacturer in Chennai that needs the port for exports.\nInfrastructure improvements are particularly important because manufacturing companies are buying more and more components from far-flung suppliers. Making sure all those parts arrive on time requires a reliable transportation system.\n\"Manufacturing is no longer done all under one roof,\" said Victor Fung, the chairman of the Li & Fung Group, a large Hong Kong-based company that buys goods from factories across Asia for sale to retailers and wholesalers in the United States and Europe.\nIndian officials are talking about expansion. Planning is under way for new wharves at Nhava Sheva, but the years-long task of construction has not yet started.\nChina has faced capacity problems, too. A surge in steel production in early 2004 overwhelmed bulk cargo ports. Inflation quintupled in a year, to 5.3 percent, as bottlenecks at ports, highways, railroads and elsewhere in China drove up companies' costs.\nThe Chinese response was swift and decisive. The pace of port investment nearly tripled in six months. Work crews labored around the clock to erect more cranes and expand wharves.\nThe Chinese economy grew at a breathtaking pace of 11.3 percent in the second quarter of 2006, but consumer prices were just 1 percent higher in July than a year earlier.\nBy contrast, India is struggling with 8 percent inflation this summer as bottlenecks have appeared after three years of 8 percent growth.\nBelatedly, India's roads and ports are improving. Just four years ago, Sona Koyo Steering Systems, an auto parts manufacturer, incurred hefty financing costs to keep a month's inventory on hand in case deliveries were delayed. Now its factory in Gurgaon makes six deliveries a day to a nearby Maruti car assembly plant; the eight-mile drive takes an hour or more because of traffic jams, but the deliveries get through.\n\"I'm not going to deny infrastructure is bad,\" said Surinder Kapur, Sona's chairman and managing director. \"But a lot of our vendors are around us, a lot of our customers are close to us.\"\nIndia is also starting to address chronic power shortages. But it is still a serious problem in northern India, where Mr. Kapur has his steering systems factory. He receives electricity from the national grid just seven or eight hours a day. So the factory has three enormous diesel generators, one bigger than a typical Manhattan living room, operating at four times what an industrial user in the United States usually pays.\nDespite such obstacles, India's manufacturing sector appears poised for further growth. In a country where the national symbol has shifted from government bureaucrats at aging desks to call center operators in cubicles, it looks as if the next icon will be the laptop-toting engineer on a factory floor.\n\"The old philosophy was, 'I should work in an office, come in at 10 and leave at 4,' \" said Nitin Kulkarni, 35, an engineer at the Hazira steel mill. But in recent years, he added, \"there has been a revolution.\"",

    "text": "After Londonistan\n2006-06-25T05:00:00.000Z\nI.\n\"Behold!\" reads an official police notice on the waiting-room wall at the Bethnal Green police station, in the East London borough of Tower Hamlets. \"Fear from people should not prevent one from saying the truth if he knows it.\" It is a hadith saying of the Prophet Muhammad, stuck amid a row of posters urging Britons to do their civic duty and report any crimes they might get wind of. Tower Hamlets, which includes large Bengali and Somali communities, is a majority-minority borough. Someone there apparently felt that the hadith poster might help woo those for whom civic duty was an insufficient spur. Today, Britain has more than a million and a half Muslims. A million live in London, where they make up an eighth of the population. They are not just the refugees and tempest-tossed laborers of the developing world, large though those groups may be. London's West End is full of Saudi princes and financiers, and journalists and politicians from around the Arab world; its East End is home to erudite theologians from the Indian subcontinent, along with some unhinged ones. In the 1980's and 90's, a hands-off government allowed London to become a haven for radicals and a center for calls to jihad. Culturally and politically (and theologically and gastronomically), London ranks among the capitals of the Muslim world and is certainly its chief point of contact with the United States and the rest of the West. Since last July 7, when four young British Muslims used backpack bombs to take their own lives and those of 52 others on London's public-transport system, getting information out of the city's various Muslim communities has become a desperate preoccupation of British law enforcement.\nLord Carlile of Berriew, a Welshman who is Britain's independent reviewer of counterterrorism laws, has wide access to classified intelligence about terrorism plans. He is the last person you would expect to hype the dangers. For one thing, his party, the Liberal Democrats, has reaped electoral gains by opposing Tony Blair's war on terror, particularly Blair's belief that Iraq is a front in that war. For another, Lord Carlile has made a name for himself as a civil libertarian -- a champion of legal underdogs from the terminally ill to the transsexual -- and civil libertarians are the ones who have led the opposition to antiterror measures. \"How serious is it?\" he asked, sitting beside a conference-room table in his law chambers off the Strand on a sunny morning this spring. \"Very. Complacency, tempting though it is, is the worst possible attitude. We've been fortunate we haven't had more attacks. There will be more.\"\nBritish unease about terrorism has deepened in recent weeks. In early June, hundreds of London police officers, backed by chemical-weapons experts, raided a row house and shot a man in Forest Gate, a heavily South Asian neighborhood, reportedly acting on a tip that some kind of cyanide device was inside. They discovered nothing -- aside from hostile neighbors and the outrage of several influential Muslim organizations.\nNot long before, a report on last summer's bombings, issued by the Home Office, which is in charge of national law enforcement, told a disturbing story of normal English Muslim kids turning into terrorists. Three of the bombers were Englishmen of Pakistani descent from Beeston, a neighborhood in Leeds. One was a Jamaican-born Muslim convert from nearby Huddersfield. A few years ago, all of them would have been considered part of the new, multicultural England branded \"Cool Britannia\" in the press and bragged about by government and citizens alike. Especially demoralizing was the posthumous video message of 30-year-old Mohammad Sidique Khan, the ringleader, which was broadcast on Al Jazeera two months after his death. His claims that Muslims were being mistreated throughout the world were familiar enough from other suicide-bomber videos. But Khan's thick, native Yorkshire accent -- like something that had strayed out of a film adaptation of a Bront\u00eb novel, or a documentary about striking miners -- was disheartening to British viewers. By then, Khan's white childhood friends had made it known that they had called him Sid and had been really fond of him. One told the BBC, \"I just thought of him as a Beeston lad, and that's what he was -- a Beeston lad, born and bred.\"\nSeven or eight major plots were reportedly broken up between 2001 and the July 7 bombings. One involved a ricin attack on the Heathrow Express train planned by terrorists linked to a radical Algerian group. Since July 7, there have been four more serious terror plots -- including a widely reported incident last year on July 21 when four suicide bombs failed to detonate. The would-be terrorists were arrested days later, but not before a Brazilian on his way to work was mistaken for one of them and shot dead by the police in the Stockwell Underground station. Considering that Britain is less despised among the world's Islamist radicals than the United States, and that its Muslim communities are, by and large, smaller, better-integrated and more prosperous than those on the continent, this is a lot of activity.\nII.\n\"Let no one be in any doubt,\" Prime Minister Tony Blair told the country a month after last July's attacks. \"The rules of the game are changing.\" Britain has been adjusting its terror laws since the Blair government came to power in 1997. But Sept. 11, 2001, sparked calls for broad new government powers, and July 7, 2005, has created a consensus -- a fragile one, but a consensus nonetheless -- that even those are insufficient. The new rules Blair spoke of were to be found in a 12-point plan that included tighter enforcement of asylum and deportation, blacklists of extremist bookshops and bans on hard-line Islamist groups. Some of the measures were discarded as too punitive, but the ones that remain have dominated parliamentary and public debate ever since. After the bombings, Blair warned that those who do not \"share and support the values that sustain the British way of life,\" or who incite hatred against Britain and its people, \"have no place here.\" In February, he added that Islamist preachers who condone terrorism \"should not be in this country.\" It was tempting to assume that Blair was simply hardening his line, moving from Islam-Is-Peace to Love-It-or-Leave-It. But the government insists that it will do everything in consultation with the country's 1.6 million Muslims, half of whom are under 25, with the goal of winning their hearts and minds.\nWhether that kind of outreach is compatible with a hard line depends, of course, on Muslim sentiments. Identifying and influencing those sentiments -- promoting \"moderate Muslims\" is the way the challenge is usually framed -- is trickier than it sounds. What is a moderate Muslim? It could mean someone who's not very serious about his religion or someone who's quite serious about his religion but not very political about it. What of the common formulation that terrorism is \"not Islam\"? This could be a politically correct dodge or a hardheaded diagnosis that something more unholy is at work. The mainstream Islamic organizations, which unite Muslims around political grievances, are certainly a useful route into the British political system, but maybe they are whipping up those grievances in the first place. And nonbelievers are so numerous among people of immigrant background that dealing with religious leaders may be a wrongheaded strategy in the first place. Britain is working out its answers to these questions by trial and error.\nPotential terrorists now in Britain -- those worthy of being kept under careful watch -- may number in the several hundreds, as Blair said last year, or in the thousands, as a police official told me this spring. Britain's approach -- tightening up law enforcement for all its citizens, while trying to ensure that Muslims feel represented in every step of the process -- differs from that of both the United States, which has focused on border control and electronic eavesdropping, and France, which relies on infiltration and an aggressive investigative judiciary. But its basic problem in fighting terrorism is the same one that all Western countries face. Britain is trying to clamp down on its Muslim communities and empower them at the same time. Clamp down too hard, and you alienate the people you want to win over. Empower communities indiscriminately, and you give free rein to people it is foolish to trust.\nIII.\nJuliet Luswa, a police constable who grew up in Uganda, and Ahmed Asania, a Bangladeshi-English special police constable, see a lot of London when they walk the beat on a Friday afternoon in Shoreditch, Spitalfields and Whitechapel. The areas are both rich and poor, teeming with immigrants and encroached on by the booming banks and brokerages of the City of London nearby. They are both yuppie dining destinations and caldrons of deprivation.\nAsania visits a woman who runs a Middle Eastern-style hookah bar who has seen her bike, stolen the week before, being sold by a street dealer a block away. Among the worshipers leaving Friday prayers at the Jamia Masjid mosque -- which was built as a Huguenot church in the 18th century and served as a synagogue for most of the 20th -- they greet an elderly Liberal Democrat politician from somewhere in South Asia who has just won a seat on the local council, despite his unsteady English. Asania and Luswa point out the flats on Heneage Street where the most dangerous Caribbean gangs loiter and the podlike public toilets on Bethnal Green Road, which are going to be removed because heroin addicts barricade themselves inside with their works.\nBack on Brick Lane, a musclebound, slick-haired hood, loitering in front of a fried-chicken shop across the street, starts haranguing Luswa in Urdu, which she doesn't speak. The guy has a reputation for this sort of thing. His insults are probably misogynistic. A couple of people nearby snicker. You would need to know a lot about the neighborhood to say whether they're laughing out of sympathy, contempt or intimidation.\n\"He's in a boxing league,\" Asania mentions as the two walk away. \"He's really excellent.\" It seems to be an explanation of something.\nThe London Metropolitan Police have long had an official, national counterterrorist role and were prominent in the fight against the I.R.A. But there is not yet a consensus on what the police role ought to be in the fight against Islamist terrorism. Are they there to take the fight to the malefactors, assuming they can find them, through hard-edged tactics ranging from surveillance to raids? Or are they there to keep the peace and listen, particularly in minority neighborhoods, minimizing the discontent, insecurity and alienation on which terrorism feeds? \"Communities defeat terrorism\" has become the mantra of the police under Sir Ian Blair (no relation to the prime minister), who has been commissioner since early last year. Blair is undertaking big reforms in the police, even as adversaries inside and outside the force call on Tony Blair to fire him -- over the recent Forest Gate raid and the mistaken-identity killing in Stockwell last summer. By the end of this year, he hopes to have set up hundreds of Safer Neighborhoods teams, like the one Luswa and Asania serve on, which mix traditional bobby work with a bit of cultural translation. Commissioner Blair aspires to kill two birds with one stone -- enhancing police familiarity with the most intimate corners of dangerous neighborhoods while winning the trust of communities that often feel left out of the main current of British life. But, as in the London of Hogarth and Mayhew, the borderline between cultural variety and dangerous criminality can be a fuzzy one.\nThe British government has dropped broad hints that it is stepping up surveillance and infiltration. The percentage of intelligence resources devoted to terrorism has more than doubled in the last five years. Mosques are not off limits. \"Any cleric with radical ideas proselytizes at his peril,\" Lord Carlile told me. According to the Home Office, extremists are using mosques less and less -- and private homes more and more -- to carry out their activities.\nBut the inability of the police to spot what was happening in Leeds on the eve of the July 7 bombings has given rise to doubts over whether there is much surveillance at all -- or, if there is, whether it works. Beeston had a Muslim youth club, which Mohammad Sidique Khan helped manage; an Islamist bookstore; and a place known, even before July 7, as Al Qaeda gym, where Khan and two of his collaborators worked out. Nearly a year after the attacks, the Home Office admits that no one has yet given a clear account of what went on inside those places.\nAggressive information-gathering is also meeting steady community opposition. Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 lets the police designate areas where anyone can be stopped and searched without cause. Muslims say that Section 44 is being used to target them. It tends to be the first thing heads of Muslim organizations complain about if you bring up the war on terror. Liberty, the British equivalent of the American Civil Liberties Union, has accused the London Police of making virtually the entire city a Section 44 area. And other governmental organizations have put police antiterrorist operations under close scrutiny. After the raid in Forest Gate earlier this month, the Independent Police Complaints Commission arrived on the scene to respond to complaints that had been filed before the wider public even knew the purpose of the raid.\nIV.\nHow you go about gathering information on a community depends on whether you think the best intelligence is dug out by agents or volunteered by concerned citizens. This is a question on which police officers of the very highest rank are divided. Sir Ian's predecessor, Lord Stevens of Kirkwhelpington, champions traditional police skills. \"It helps when communities come out with information,\" he said in May. \"But most I.R.A. attacks were solved by fingerprints and other forensic police work. This is not just hearts and minds. You can never put all your eggs in that basket.\"\nSir Ian, speaking on a drizzly May afternoon in the Westminster police headquarters building called New Scotland Yard, puts himself in the camp of those who think that most useful information is volunteered. And that is no less true when dealing with Muslims than with any other religious group. \"After an atrocity of the scale of the 7th of July, it is impossible that we will not be more intrusive,\" explained Sir Ian, a ruddy and eloquent man with excitable eyes and a direct manner. \"But we can't do this to them, we can only do this with them. We start from a different place than we did with the Irish Republican Army, which had declared war against the British state. This is a far more difficult arena. We mustn't be seen to be attempting to infiltrate the entire Muslim community, 99.9 percent of which are entirely law-abiding.\" Safer Neighborhoods teams, in other words, are not spies. \"The whole deal here,\" he continued, \"is to engender the trust that one afternoon may allow one of those Islamic leaders to say to the sergeant, 'You know, I'm worried about young so-and-so.\"'\nIt takes no great leap of imagination to see how sensitive policing could prevent terrorism. The garbage man who serviced 18 Alexandra Grove in Leeds, where Khan and his friends made the bombs for the July 7 attacks, said that in the days before the explosions he collected something he had never seen before on the job: rubber cartons of peroxide in large quantities. That peroxide, used to make bombs, bleached the hair of the young men, to the consternation of their Pakistani parents, and killed the flowers in the boxes outside the window.\nBut community policing carries a big risk: in reaching out to people on the streets, the police may become overly dependent on them. At a local level, it can mean police collusion with whichever interest group makes the most credible threat of disruption. A year and a half ago, Sikhs in Birmingham rioted over the play \"Behzti\" (\"Dishonor\"), which many found offensive. Representatives of the theater and the community sat down with the police. The theater subsequently issued a statement saying that the safety of its patrons could not be guaranteed. As John Lloyd, a director of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford, recalls, \"The police decided they were more interested in not having a riot than in freedom of expression.\" The play closed. When the representative organizations in question are not Sikh groups but Muslim ones, which are more numerous and more visible, the likelihood of conflict increases a lot.\nV.\nWhat the police are doing on the street in East London is being replicated in other walks of life. The legislative packet Tony Blair outlined last August tries to balance two things: the harder line demanded by the public after July 7 and an unwillingness -- whether out of common decency, constitutional propriety or political correctness -- to single out Muslims. Proposals that didn't manage both things -- closing radical mosques, for instance, which clearly made targets of Muslims -- have been sidelined. But ensuring that all new laws were both tough and unbiased hasn't got Blair out of the woods. On the contrary, it has produced strange, new ad hoc coalitions against him. On one side are many Tories who have shed their traditional law-and-order views and now object to seeing law-abiding Middle Englanders scrutinized as if they were potential terrorists. On the other side are the left of his own party and the even more left-leaning Liberal Democrats.\nIn controversy after controversy, it has been New Labor versus everyone else. First, the government continued its fight -- started before July 7 -- to establish a new national identity card. The rationale has always been clear: to identify people who are in the country illegally, as a tool against both terrorism and welfare fraud. But the database established along with the card was wide-ranging enough to frighten civil libertarians. \"What if you've had an abortion, or been treated for a sexually transmitted disease?\" asks David Davis, who as the Tories' shadow home secretary formulates his party's terrorism policy. \"The government says this information can't be accessed by someone without your knowing about it. If not, then why the hell is it there?\" He has a point, but since July 7, the political alignment favors security over privacy, and the card is on track to be issued in two or three years.\nThe government also sought laws that would permit it to detain terrorist suspects for 90 days without charge. There was strong resistance, particularly from \"ancient rights\" Tories, who pointed out that habeas corpus has been enshrined in British law for 700 years. The government and the police replied that the evidentiary puzzles that arise when international terrorist networks, computers and tight deadlines meet were something entirely new. One case they like to mention involved inquiries abroad concerning 10 men with 860 false identities, using 2,500 different mobile-phone SIM cards and encrypted computers on which much of the data was in a Farsi dialect. The government did not get its 90 days, but it did get 28, a victory under the circumstances.\nIn a further initiative, the government sought to establish an offense of \"glorifying terrorism.\" The new crime was meant to catch the whipping-up of homicidal feeling, as when the group al-Muhajiroun publicized an event, on the second anniversary of the World Trade Center attacks, that would celebrate the 9/11 hijackers as \"the Magnificent 19.\" It was also meant to block recruitment. The home secretary at the time, Charles Clarke, suggested that saying \"Terrorists go straight to paradise when they die\" might be captured by the law. But what else might be captured? Some asked if an Irishman who celebrated the Easter Rising of 1916 would fall afoul of the statute. Not to mention Blair's own wife, the human rights lawyer Cherie Booth, who once said, with reference to the Palestinians, \"As long as young people feel that they have got no hope but to blow themselves up, you are never going to make progress.\" The law passed on an understanding of \"glorification\" that resembled Justice Potter Stewart's famed definition of hard-core pornography: as something that judges and the public would know when they saw it. The law has probably been too undermined by ridicule to serve for much.\nThe government also brought to a final vote a \"law against incitement to religious hatred\" that it had been discussing for five years. It is here that the intellectual underpinnings of the Blair approach were clearest. The law, which had been sought only by Muslims, was first demanded by the U.K. Action Committee on Islamic Affairs, a group formed to protest Salman Rushdie's portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad in \"The Satanic Verses.\" One argument for the law was that Anglicans, as worshipers in an established church, were already protected from certain insults by blasphemy laws, while Jews and Sikhs were protected from others by antiracism laws. But to the legislation's detractors, these were just post-facto rationalizations, for the law was unprecedented in its sweep. As drafted, it would have made it difficult to criticize anything that advanced itself in the name of religious belief or practice, since the law permitted prosecution of anybody who was \"reckless as to whether religious hatred would be stirred up\" by things he said or wrote.\nIt was a sort of horse trading with the principles of free speech, and it drove much of the country into a fury. The Daily Mail columnist Melanie Phillips later told me: \"The term 'politically correct' does not do justice to this sinister totalitarian project. It is against not just freedom of speech but also freedom of thought.\" She added that Britons were particularly vulnerable to such incursions: \"It's very British not to want to give offense. And political Islam is the world grievance culture par excellence. It's a perfect fit.\" Rowan Atkinson, the comedian, said that the law, if passed, would make it impossible to crack jokes involving religion.\nThe measure was clobbered in public opinion and was neutered by Parliament when it came to a vote in late January. David Blunkett -- the blind, hard-line, scandal-plagued home secretary from 2001 until 2004 and the architect of much of Britain's post-9/11 antiterror policy -- defended the bill to the bitter end. Many accused him of offering a sop to Muslim organizations in exchange for which they were supposed to accept the rest of the Blair antiterror program. Blunkett makes no bones about the law's having been meant mainly to protect Muslims. \"Yes, I do accept that,\" he said when we spoke in April. \"They were the primary beneficiaries because they would have been provided with a degree of certainty they didn't have before. But the debate got silly. It got distorted into whether people could make jokes about religion.\"\nIt didn't help the bill that it was scheduled for a vote in Parliament as the Danish cartoon affair was exploding across the Middle East. Gunmen raged in Gaza, and it wasn't long before protesters would hold up placards outside London's Danish Embassy calling for genocide against nonbelievers. Under such circumstances, limiting people's ability to criticize Islam looked not only cowardly but imprudent.\nVI.\nBritons have a strong rhetorical attachment to liberty, as something for which a certain price in danger and disorder is worth paying. When I asked Blunkett if he accepted the idea that terrorists had enjoyed too many freedoms in London in the 1990's, he said, \"Well, in the sense that Karl Marx moved to London, Britain has always had a tradition of taking in people oppressed in their own countries.\" This is a common view. Immigrant troublemakers are likened to Marx and Engels, and any difficulties welcoming whole groups are likened to those occasioned by the arrival of Russian Jews in the 19th century or of Huguenots in the 17th.\nThis freedom has another name, for those less willing to take it in stride: \"Londonistan.\" In January, at his trial for incitement to murder and other charges, the radical cleric Abu Hamza claimed that between 1997 and 2000, members of MI5, the British domestic security service, effectively O.K.'d his frequent incitements to jihad, on one occasion telling him: \"Well, it's freedom of speech. You don't have to worry as long as we don't see blood on the streets.\" Hamza is an Egyptian-born British citizen who was maimed during the Afghan war against the Soviet Union and who later ran the Finsbury Park mosque in North London. Foreign governments (including the United States') urged for years that Hamza be arrested, most loudly after he was accused of organizing a 1998 attack in Yemen -- in which his son was an assailant -- that killed four tourists. Hamza's mosque was also linked to a plot to construct a weapon using ricin. When the police raided it in 2003, they found guns, chemical-warfare suits, stolen passports and laminating equipment. Hamza was finally arrested in 2004.\nThe term \"Londonistan\" was first coined by French officials outraged at the British government's inability -- for the better part of a decade -- to extradite the Algerian Rachid Ramda, who had been charged in France with financing a series of attacks on public transport in Paris in 1995. Until Ramda was finally sent to France this past December, British courts held that he could not get a fair trial there. Other prominent jihadists -- the Syrian-born Omar Bakri Muhammed, who fled the country after July 7; the Syrian-Spanish Qaeda leader Abu-Musab al-Suri, captured by coalition forces in Pakistan last fall; and Abu Qatada, who led several European Qaeda cells and is now fighting deportation to his native Jordan -- found a safe haven in 90's London.\nThe government has lately worked hard to roll up the most brazen radicals. But a series of geostrategic accidents has complicated its efforts. The leaders of Al Qaeda -- a movement created by a Saudi and chased into exile in Sudan and then Afghanistan -- have apparently wound up in or near Pakistan, one of Britain's major sources of immigration since the 50's. A significant conclusion of the government investigation of the July 7 bombings was that two of the bombers -- Mohammad Sidique Khan and Shehzad Tanweer -- probably \"had some contact with Al Qaeda figures\" on a trip they made to Pakistan in 2004.\nLike most modern \"diaspora\" immigrants, the Pakistani-British visit their native country with little difficulty. There were 400,000 British visitors to Pakistan in 2004. All countries with large Muslim diasporas are vulnerable to the worldwide Wahhabi radicalization fomented at mosques and cultural centers financed by Saudi Arabia's government and its private charities. But on top of that, Britain is vulnerable to radicalizing trends of South Asia -- India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. These trends risk becoming Britain's own, particularly among its socially isolated minorities.\nFor many years, Britain has had a well-deserved reputation as the European country that best integrated its new arrivals. For one thing, it had rich immigrants as well as poor. Many Muslims -- not just Arabian playboys but also East African businessmen -- arrived with some capital, hired their fellow exiles and educated their families. Britain's tradition of local democratic institutions, like town and city councils, means that anywhere an immigrant population settles, a class of political leaders grows out of it. There are now several Muslims in Parliament and even in the House of Lords. The contrast with France, where 1 in 10 residents are Muslims but there are no Muslims among the 577 deputies in the National Assembly, is stark.\nBut over the past quarter-century, Britain has seen a dispiriting tendency toward segregation, or resegregation. Young newcomers have not found a niche in the service economy as easily as the arrivals of 40 and 50 years ago did in the industrial one. Others, born in Britain, have cast about for identities other than the British one they were raised with. In 2001, the northern industrial towns of Oldham, Burnley and Bradford experienced several days of violent racial mayhem between white and Asian gangs. A Home Office report issued in the wake of the riots found \"separate educational arrangements, community and voluntary bodies, employment, places of worship, language, social and cultural networks,\" producing living arrangements that \"do not seem to touch at any point.\" As one Pakistani Briton told the report's authors, \"When I leave this meeting with you, I will go home and not see another white face until I come back here next week.\" Last year, Trevor Phillips, chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, warned that much of Britain was \"sleepwalking its way toward segregation.\" And this segregation is especially entrenched among Muslims. The researchers Tariq Modood and Richard Berthoud have shown that only 1 percent of British Bangladeshis and Pakistanis have white partners, versus 20 percent of Afro-Carribeans. The percentage of South Asian Britons who return to Bangladesh and Pakistan to find wives or husbands is hard to measure, but some researchers place it above 50 percent, and a European demographer calls ethnic endogamy \"arrestingly high.\"\nIt is not just outward behaviors but also inward mentalities that are diverging. Through a familiar paradox, global media play a role in this divergence. London is one of six cities in which The Daily Jang, Pakistan's largest paper, is published, so the second-generation tube rider who 20 years ago would have been absorbed in the county cricket scores in his Evening Standard is now preoccupied with the conduct of India in Kashmir and with what Pakistani Muslims ought to do about it. Many South Asian immigrants get their news from Urdu television stations and, despite the language barrier, from Al Jazeera. Many more are likely to subscribe to Al Jazeera once its English-language service -- slated to have made its debut this spring, but delayed -- is up and running.\nSouth Asian religion has changed, too. The Islam that most immigrants took to Britain from the Indian subcontinent was a pious traditional Sufism, marked by great reverence for the Prophet Muhammad and an elaborate system of mentorship, under the control of various pirs, or holy men. Probably the majority of Britain's 1,500 or so mosques have their roots in Sufism. This kind of Islam has not been wiped out, but it has been losing ground in South Asia and Britain alike to simpler, more fashionable trends in Sunni Islam. The Deobandi school, which was founded in Pakistan in the 19th century, has grown increasingly conservative -- and distrustful of non-Islamic cultures -- under the influence of the Saudi Wahhabis. At least since the Afghan war in the 80's, hard-line Deobandi madrasas have spread throughout Pakistan. Jamaat-i-Islami, the sectarian and highly politicized movement started by the journalist Abu A'la Maududi, has grown since the 60's and is influential in the largest Muslim group in Britain, the Muslim Council of Britain (M.C.B.). While the M.C.B. has no official government status, it does claim to speak for much of the Muslim population and is the government's interlocutor of first resort when integration is at issue.\nAfzal Khan, an attorney who has just completed a term as lord mayor of Manchester, is a Labor member of the City Council and sits on the central working committee of the M.C.B. as well. Khan recently secured the financing that will help him realize his dream -- to build an Islamic cultural center in the city he moved to as a youth, where 125,000 Muslims now live. Since this project is about \"bridge building,\" he sees no need to apologize for having sought a great deal of the money for it from Saudi Arabia. \"My attitude is, if it's a good cause, everyone has a right to contribute,\" he told me in an empty conference room in Manchester's City Hall on his last day as mayor. \"If anyone in America wants to give a million, they have as much right as anyone else.\"\nAsked to address terrorism, Khan said: \"The real issue is taking a step back and looking at the whole issue in a wider context. One side's terrorist is another side's freedom fighter. How do we bring about a just and fair world, so there are not any causes for terrorism? You have the Middle East. Then America comes into the game, and that brings in petrol. Quite frankly, it has been appalling. They didn't give a damn about the suffering of people. That's one thing that winds people up.\n\"And another thing,\" he adds. \"There are many Muslims who have a question: How come America gets to decide who gets a nuclear weapon?\"\nWhen you talk to many Muslim leaders in Britain, you hear them focus almost obsessively on international politics, to the exclusion of religious, social and local political issues. The charitable way of looking at this is to say that it is a function of young people's burning to change the world -- for the median age of Muslims is more than a decade younger than that of other Britons, which is pushing into the early 40's. The uncharitable way is to say that even some mainstream religious leaders are practicing what the French Islamologist Olivier Roy calls \"neofundamentalism\" -- or what the Iranian journalist Amir Taheri calls \"a religion without a theology, a secular wolf disguised as a religious lamb.\"\nIf the \"religion\" causing problems is not really about religious things at all, then the risk of talking at cross-purposes is high. The \"national\" government wants to talk about local integration and facilities and role models, while \"local\" representatives want to talk about the West Bank. Sir Ian Blair, the police commissioner, has suggested broadening the interchange with Muslims following what he calls a \"traffic light\" system. The government will obviously speak to community leaders (green), and it obviously won't speak to terrorists (red), but it will speak to certain \"amber\" (yellow) interlocutors whom Americans might be reluctant to touch. Among those who fit in the amber category might be Yusuf Qaradawi, the telemufti of Qatar, who has issued several fatwas in support of suicide bombing. Lecturing in the United States recently, Commissioner Blair granted that Qaradawi \"has views on the Palestinian intifada that probably would not be very acceptable either here or in the U.K.,\" but also said that he was impressed that \"he can command an audience of 50,000 young people at the drop of a hat.\"\nSir Ian once said that \"there is nothing wrong with being a fundamentalist Muslim, any more than there is anything wrong with being a fundamentalist Christian.\" He was assailed in the press, but he had a point. What if terrorism does not come from a certain attitude toward religion but from a certain attitude toward politics? Pushing Muslim identity in a more \"fundamentalist\" direction could mean more contemplation of God and less contemplation of grievance. Pushing Muslim identity in a more \"mainstream\" direction could mean encouraging grandstanding and political ultimatums.\nThe Muslim Council of Britain now boycotts Holocaust Memorial Day every January, on the grounds that it focuses too exclusively on the genocide committed against the Jews. In response, Asim Siddiqui, the young leader of a London-based Muslim group called City Circle, organized a separate Holocaust memorial event. City Circle declares itself \"nonaligned to any overseas or established doctrinal organization.\" Siddiqui is clearly a courageous and independent man. Yet the M.C.B. still gets more invitations to governmental meetings and is accepted as the logical outlet for the community's demands after, say, an antiterrorist raid. It is a good example of how the \"traffic light\" strategy can fail. Its incentives drive community representatives toward radicalism. Strident political voices are not just admitted to conversation -- they are the preferred voices, because they are seen as more \"authentic.\" If the government's top priority is finding people with the street credibility to dissuade potential terrorists, then the ideal Muslim interlocutor is someone who shares the terrorists' goals while publicly condemning their means. Standing up for Holocaust victims and for fellowship among Britain's peoples is not much of a credential.\nVII.\nHow much sympathy do most Muslims have for radical extremists? \"Abu Hamza is in Belmarsh prison,\" says the Palestinian journalist Abdel Bari Atwan. \"Have you seen a demonstration for his release? A petition protesting his treatment?\"\nAtwan edits Al Quds al Arabi, an international Arabic-language daily. Its offices are upstairs from a housing authority in Hammersmith, where the redeveloped part of King Street peters out into hairdressers and used-clothing shops. Through a security-locked front door you enter a mini-newsroom of dusty carpets and a half-dozen old and mismatched computers. The walls are hung with Palestinian posters, and Arabic TV runs in the corner. Atwan's premises are modest, and his paper has a low profile locally. But it has a reputation throughout the Arab world for reporting the news without fear or favor. Atwan interviewed Osama bin Laden at his hideout in Afghanistan in 1996 and recently wrote an authoritative history of his movement. When Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the March 2004 Madrid bombings, it was to Atwan that the claim was faxed.\nThe problem, as Atwan sees it, is that the British and the Americans have always underestimated the intelligence and logic of Al Qaeda: \"For the British, it's a terrorist organization that did Sept. 11 and is linked to July 7, that kills indiscriminately. But they never try to understand what's behind it. They never look at the roots of the problem. It's a terrorist organization, yes! But why?\" Atwan's answer is that the United States and its allies pursue a foreign policy that includes military occupation -- in Israel, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Until that changes, he says, \"the current escalation of suicide attacks is unlikely to abate.\"\nTaji Mustafa, a charismatic and confrontational spokesman for the group Hizb ut-Tahrir, would agree. Hizb ut-Tahrir, like Al Qaeda, favors the re-establishment of the caliphate, the central Muslim authority disbanded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1924. Arguing that its doctrines can serve as a \"conveyor belt\" to terrorism, the British government has discussed banning the group, whose activities have already been banned in Germany. \"Ourselves, the vast majority unequivocally condemn terrorism,\" said Mustafa, who is the son of Nigerian parents, over a cup of tea in a hotel near Regent's Park. \"None of us justifies targeting civilians in London or Madrid.\" Nonviolence is the official Hizb ut-Tahrir position, although when it comes to Israel, Mustafa (in his conversation) and the organization (in its literature) are much less direct in their disavowal of violence.\nMustafa says that in talking up a ban on Hizb ut-Tahrir, the Blair government is expanding the definition of terrorism to cover nonterrorists. \"They're creating a thought crime,\" Mustafa said. \"If they ban Hizb ut-Tahrir, is it going to stop me as an individual from arguing for a caliphate?\" But worse, he says that the government is dodging a legitimate argument over its foreign policy and misrepresenting the wishes of British Muslims. Mustafa was particularly angered at a speech Blair gave nine days after the bombings last summer, in which he described the \"evil ideology\" of terrorists in a way that made it sound a lot like Hizb ut-Tahrir's ideology. \"They demand the elimination of Israel,\" Blair said, \"the withdrawal of all Westerners from Muslim countries. . .the establishment of effectively Taliban states and Shariah law in the Arab world en route to one caliphate of all Muslim nations. We don't have to wonder what type of country those states would be.\"\n\"Why didn't he take our views on?\" asked an indignant Mustafa. \"My challenge is, Go to Whitechapel and ask: Do you question the state of Israel? Do you believe in Shariah law?\"\nShariah does not quite command majority support among British Muslims. A poll in February in The Daily Telegraph showed that 40 percent of British Muslims favor the establishment of Islamic law -- but only piecemeal, and under certain circumstances. Even in heavily Muslim neighborhoods, there is no great public clamor to ban alcohol -- usually a telltale sign of pro-Shariah agitation. And Britain's relaxed laws regarding religious dress -- more akin to the American model than to the French -- have allowed it to avoid the controversies over the Muslim headscarf that have roiled the rest of Europe. But Mustafa's other claim -- that the vast majority of citizens in heavily Muslim Whitechapel sympathize viscerally and overwhelmingly with the radical position on Israel and, more generally, on foreign policy -- must be faced squarely. For Mustafa is unquestionably correct.\nPeople often talk about the \"diversity\" of the British Muslim population. This is fair if the dimension you are concerned about is skin color or per capita income or attitudes on the relative merits of Hanafi and Hanbali jurisprudence. But if the dimension is Western foreign policy, then there is really very little diversity at all. A Draft Report on Young Muslims and Extremism leaked from the Home Office in 2004 found that a main source of anger among youth was \"a perception of 'double standards' in British foreign policy, where democracy is preached but oppression of the 'Ummah' (the one nation of believers) is practiced or tolerated, e.g. in Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan, Kashmir, Chechnya.\" By overwhelming numbers, Muslims oppose all intervention in the Arab and Muslim world. Somewhere between 64 and 80 percent, depending on the poll you consult, opposed the recent Afghan war. \"Yes, we have a responsibility to encourage our children against extremism,\" I was told by Abdirahman Warsame, a Somali who was chosen by the Muslim Association of Britain to run the Finsbury Park mosque after Abu Hamza, \"but government has the responsibility to review its policy.\"\nForeign policy may be the only dimension on which moderates and radicals agree. But it happens to be the dimension the terrorists cite when they blow up buses. That harmony of worldview is a dire problem for Britain in general and Muslims in particular -- no matter how narrow the terrain on which it is built. It creates a climate in which a sympathetic hearing is guaranteed for any claim that the real cause of terrorism is Iraq or Israel or America's love of big oil. (And if you are hunting terrorists by, say, tapping phones, it makes terrorists impossible to identify solely through the politics they profess.)\nIn this light, Britain's participation in the war in Iraq opened a can of worms. A draft of a top-secret Joint Intelligence Committee report, leaked to The Observer this spring, found that \"Iraq is likely to be an important motivating factor for some time to come in the radicalization of British Muslims and for those extremists who view attacks against the U.K. as legitimate.\" John Denham, a Labor M.P. who resigned from the government over the Iraq invasion, says that such viewpoints are common. \"Iraq is one of the factors that feed the view that the government is casual to the point of unconcern about lives of Muslims,\" he told me in the cafeteria in Portcullis House, across the street from Parliament. \"By providing a focal point for Muslim anger, it was likely to bring a rise in world terrorism.\"\nWhether Iraq is a \"cause\" of terror or a mere pretext is a difficult question. Radical jihadists have threatened and attacked countries that opted out of the Iraq conflict. And if Iraq \"causes\" someone to become a suicide bomber, it is almost certainly not in the way Western liberals understand political causation. The terrorist may already hold jihadist views. He may be whipped into bloodlust by images on TV or the Internet. He may regard the invasion of Iraq as an incursion upon the prerogatives of the Ummah -- but the source of his anger is unlikely to be any supposed violation of international law. In the end, though, it may not matter if everyone means something different by \"Iraq.\" A shared opposition to the war tightens the identification between radical and nonradical Muslims, and between both those groups and some members of the non-Muslim Western left, and this muddies the terms with which the battle of ideas around terrorism is fought.\nThere is another problem. If the jihadists from all over the world who have gone to fight in Iraq follow the example of their Afghan forebears and carry on the jihad when they return home, then Britain is going to be very hard hit. Earlier this month, The Sunday Times reported that there is a \"British brigade\" of 150 radicals fighting coalition forces in Iraq. Shortly before the death of Abu-Musab al-Zarqawi in a U.S. bombing raid earlier this month, his Web site was running English-language recruitment messages reading, \"They are fighting; you should be too.\"\nA wave of arrests in the past few weeks has made clear how hard it is to separate the fight at home and the fight abroad. In the Yorkshire town of Dewsbury, not far from Beeston, the teenage grandson of a prominent British Muslim scholar was arrested for links to the 17-man bombing conspiracy in Ontario. The two brothers mistakenly arrested in Forest Gate appeared to have a half-brother involved in February's protest in front of the Danish Embassy after the cartoon controversy. Following the raid, Yvonne Ridley, a journalist who was seized by the Taliban in 2001, converted to Islam two years later and is now a leader of the anti-Iraq war Respect Party, called on Muslims to stop cooperating with the police. Muhammed Abdul Bari, the new leader of the Muslim Council of Britain, spoke of community anger and warned: \"Angry people can do anything. Angry people can even feel that they should take the law into their own hands, so anger has to be directed into positive action.\"\nVIII.\nOn a breezy evening in May, Denis MacShane, the Labor M.P. from the northern coal-and-steel town of Rotherham, sat on the parliamentary terrace overlooking the Thames, eating a dinner of bangers and mash that he had carried out on a tray from the commons cafeteria. Other members were drinking their pints and smoking their cigarettes. As the child of a Polish immigrant, MacShane expects newcomers to claim their voices in the British conversation quickly. In 2003, he came under fire from party leaders for calling on moderate Muslims to speak up more loudly against terror. After July 7, he organized Muslim and non-Muslim leaders in Rotherham to take out a newspaper ad condemning the bombings. MacShane has always been enamored of the freedom-fighting side of his country and the cold warriors in his party -- but he is realistic about the timetable of the current conflict. It is almost as if he expects to win the war on terror with the same patience that enables his fellow countrymen to stand in lines. \"You can't stop individuals doing violence,\" he told me. \"You need to wear down acceptance and approval. Asking Muslims to repudiate all these Muslim causes is like inviting the Galway peasant of the 1940's to support Churchill.\" It's tough to tell if he's stressing the nonnegotiability of such a demand or the recalcitrance with which it is likely to be met.\nMacShane is basically counseling patience, as many in Britain's government do. A month before the July 7 attacks, Britain's Joint Intelligence Committee made the judgment that \"there would probably be a successful attack of some sort in the U.K. in the next five years.\" Today, British authorities are not much more confident of thwarting all plots, so they have erected a line of defense that is absorptive, not pre-emptive. It rests on harmony between social groups and on the country's ability to suffer atrocities from time to time, as it did during the heyday of the I.R.A., without escalating unrest or oppression, or the rise of extremist parties. Britain is now betting that the country will retain its historically bottomless reserves of sang-froid in the face of a threat that is orders of magnitude more dangerous than the threat of the I.R.A.; that there is something in the makeup of Britons that makes them more stoical than, say, Americans in New York about bombs going off; that the quiet tenor of the British fight against Islamist terrorism thus far is a sign of good manners and forbearance, not of abject fright or sneaking sympathy; and that Britain in the age of the Diana funeral is the same country it was during the blitz.\nIt is a risky bet.\nChristopher Caldwell, a contributing writer, is at work on a book about immigration, Islam and Europe.",

    "text": "After Londonistan\n2006-06-25T04:00:00.000Z\nI.\n \"Behold!\" reads an official police notice on the waiting-room wall at the Bethnal Green police station, in the East London borough of Tower Hamlets. \"Fear from people should not prevent one from saying the truth if he knows it.\" It is a hadith saying of the Prophet Muhammad, stuck amid a row of posters urging Britons to do their civic duty and report any crimes they might get wind of. Tower Hamlets, which includes large Bengali and Somali communities, is a majority-minority borough. Someone there apparently felt that the hadith poster might help woo those for whom civic duty was an insufficient spur. Today, Britain has more than a million and a half Muslims. A million live in London, where they make up an eighth of the population. They are not just the refugees and tempest-tossed laborers of the developing world, large though those groups may be. London's West End is full of Saudi princes and financiers, and journalists and politicians from around the Arab world; its East End is home to erudite theologians from the Indian subcontinent, along with some unhinged ones. In the 1980's and 90's, a hands-off government allowed London to become a haven for radicals and a center for calls to jihad. Culturally and politically (and theologically and gastronomically), London ranks among the capitals of the Muslim world and is certainly its chief point of contact with the United States and the rest of the West. Since last July 7, when four young British Muslims used backpack bombs to take their own lives and those of 52 others on London's public-transport system, getting information out of the city's various Muslim communities has become a desperate preoccupation of British law enforcement.\nLord Carlile of Berriew, a Welshman who is Britain's independent reviewer of counterterrorism laws, has wide access to classified intelligence about terrorism plans. He is the last person you would expect to hype the dangers. For one thing, his party, the Liberal Democrats, has reaped electoral gains by opposing Tony Blair's war on terror, particularly Blair's belief that Iraq is a front in that war. For another, Lord Carlile has made a name for himself as a civil libertarian \u2014 a champion of legal underdogs from the terminally ill to the transsexual \u2014 and civil libertarians are the ones who have led the opposition to antiterror measures. \"How serious is it?\" he asked, sitting beside a conference-room table in his law chambers off the Strand on a sunny morning this spring. \"Very. Complacency, tempting though it is, is the worst possible attitude. We've been fortunate we haven't had more attacks. There will be more.\"\nBritish unease about terrorism has deepened in recent weeks. In early June, hundreds of London police officers, backed by chemical-weapons experts, raided a row house and shot a man in Forest Gate, a heavily South Asian neighborhood, reportedly acting on a tip that some kind of cyanide device was inside. They discovered nothing \u2014 aside from hostile neighbors and the outrage of several influential Muslim organizations. \nNot long before, a report on last summer's bombings, issued by the Home Office, which is in charge of national law enforcement, told a disturbing story of normal English Muslim kids turning into terrorists. Three of the bombers were Englishmen of Pakistani descent from Beeston, a neighborhood in Leeds. One was a Jamaican-born Muslim convert from nearby Huddersfield. A few years ago, all of them would have been considered part of the new, multicultural England branded \"Cool Britannia\" in the press and bragged about by government and citizens alike. Especially demoralizing was the posthumous video message of 30-year-old Mohammad Sidique Khan, the ringleader, which was broadcast on Al Jazeera two months after his death. His claims that Muslims were being mistreated throughout the world were familiar enough from other suicide-bomber videos. But Khan's thick, native Yorkshire accent \u2014 like something that had strayed out of a film adaptation of a Bront\u00eb novel, or a documentary about striking miners \u2014 was disheartening to British viewers. By then, Khan's white childhood friends had made it known that they had called him Sid and had been really fond of him. One told the BBC, \"I just thought of him as a Beeston lad, and that's what he was \u2014 a Beeston lad, born and bred.\"\nSeven or eight major plots were reportedly broken up between 2001 and the July 7 bombings. One involved a ricin attack on the Heathrow Express train planned by terrorists linked to a radical Algerian group. Since July 7, there have been four more serious terror plots \u2014 including a widely reported incident last year on July 21 when four suicide bombs failed to detonate. The would-be terrorists were arrested days later, but not before a Brazilian on his way to work was mistaken for one of them and shot dead by the police in the Stockwell Underground station. Considering that Britain is less despised among the world's Islamist radicals than the United States, and that its Muslim communities are, by and large, smaller, better-integrated and more prosperous than those on the continent, this is a lot of activity. \nII.\n\"Let no one be in any doubt,\" Prime Minister Tony Blair told the country a month after last July's attacks. \"The rules of the game are changing.\" Britain has been adjusting its terror laws since the Blair government came to power in 1997. But Sept. 11, 2001, sparked calls for broad new government powers, and July 7, 2005, has created a consensus \u2014 a fragile one, but a consensus nonetheless \u2014 that even those are insufficient. The new rules Blair spoke of were to be found in a 12-point plan that included tighter enforcement of asylum and deportation, blacklists of extremist bookshops and bans on hard-line Islamist groups. Some of the measures were discarded as too punitive, but the ones that remain have dominated parliamentary and public debate ever since. After the bombings, Blair warned that those who do not \"share and support the values that sustain the British way of life,\" or who incite hatred against Britain and its people, \"have no place here.\" In February, he added that Islamist preachers who condone terrorism \"should not be in this country.\" It was tempting to assume that Blair was simply hardening his line, moving from Islam-Is-Peace to Love-It-or-Leave-It. But the government insists that it will do everything in consultation with the country's 1.6 million Muslims, half of whom are under 25, with the goal of winning their hearts and minds. \nWhether that kind of outreach is compatible with a hard line depends, of course, on Muslim sentiments. Identifying and influencing those sentiments \u2014 promoting \"moderate Muslims\" is the way the challenge is usually framed \u2014 is trickier than it sounds. What is a moderate Muslim? It could mean someone who's not very serious about his religion or someone who's quite serious about his religion but not very political about it. What of the common formulation that terrorism is \"not Islam\"? This could be a politically correct dodge or a hardheaded diagnosis that something more unholy is at work. The mainstream Islamic organizations, which unite Muslims around political grievances, are certainly a useful route into the British political system, but maybe they are whipping up those grievances in the first place. And nonbelievers are so numerous among people of immigrant background that dealing with religious leaders may be a wrongheaded strategy in the first place. Britain is working out its answers to these questions by trial and error. \nPotential terrorists now in Britain \u2014 those worthy of being kept under careful watch \u2014 may number in the several hundreds, as Blair said last year, or in the thousands, as a police official told me this spring. Britain's approach \u2014 tightening up law enforcement for all its citizens, while trying to ensure that Muslims feel represented in every step of the process \u2014 differs from that of both the United States, which has focused on border control and electronic eavesdropping, and France, which relies on infiltration and an aggressive investigative judiciary. But its basic problem in fighting terrorism is the same one that all Western countries face. Britain is trying to clamp down on its Muslim communities and empower them at the same time. Clamp down too hard, and you alienate the people you want to win over. Empower communities indiscriminately, and you give free rein to people it is foolish to trust.\nIII.\nJuliet Luswa, a police constable who grew up in Uganda, and Ahmed Asania, a Bangladeshi-English special police constable, see a lot of London when they walk the beat on a Friday afternoon in Shoreditch, Spitalfields and Whitechapel. The areas are both rich and poor, teeming with immigrants and encroached on by the booming banks and brokerages of the City of London nearby. They are both yuppie dining destinations and caldrons of deprivation. \nAsania visits a woman who runs a Middle Eastern-style hookah bar who has seen her bike, stolen the week before, being sold by a street dealer a block away. Among the worshipers leaving Friday prayers at the Jamia Masjid mosque \u2014 which was built as a Huguenot church in the 18th century and served as a synagogue for most of the 20th \u2014 they greet an elderly Liberal Democrat politician from somewhere in South Asia who has just won a seat on the local council, despite his unsteady English. Asania and Luswa point out the flats on Heneage Street where the most dangerous Caribbean gangs loiter and the podlike public toilets on Bethnal Green Road, which are going to be removed because heroin addicts barricade themselves inside with their works. \nBack on Brick Lane, a musclebound, slick-haired hood, loitering in front of a fried-chicken shop across the street, starts haranguing Luswa in Urdu, which she doesn't speak. The guy has a reputation for this sort of thing. His insults are probably misogynistic. A couple of people nearby snicker. You would need to know a lot about the neighborhood to say whether they're laughing out of sympathy, contempt or intimidation. \n\"He's in a boxing league,\" Asania mentions as the two walk away. \"He's really excellent.\" It seems to be an explanation of something. \nThe London Metropolitan Police have long had an official, national counterterrorist role and were prominent in the fight against the I.R.A. But there is not yet a consensus on what the police role ought to be in the fight against Islamist terrorism. Are they there to take the fight to the malefactors, assuming they can find them, through hard-edged tactics ranging from surveillance to raids? Or are they there to keep the peace and listen, particularly in minority neighborhoods, minimizing the discontent, insecurity and alienation on which terrorism feeds? \"Communities defeat terrorism\" has become the mantra of the police under Sir Ian Blair (no relation to the prime minister), who has been commissioner since early last year. Blair is undertaking big reforms in the police, even as adversaries inside and outside the force call on Tony Blair to fire him \u2014 over the recent Forest Gate raid and the mistaken-identity killing in Stockwell last summer. By the end of this year, he hopes to have set up hundreds of Safer Neighborhoods teams, like the one Luswa and Asania serve on, which mix traditional bobby work with a bit of cultural translation. Commissioner Blair aspires to kill two birds with one stone \u2014 enhancing police familiarity with the most intimate corners of dangerous neighborhoods while winning the trust of communities that often feel left out of the main current of British life. But, as in the London of Hogarth and Mayhew, the borderline between cultural variety and dangerous criminality can be a fuzzy one. \nThe British government has dropped broad hints that it is stepping up surveillance and infiltration. The percentage of intelligence resources devoted to terrorism has more than doubled in the last five years. Mosques are not off limits. \"Any cleric with radical ideas proselytizes at his peril,\" Lord Carlile told me. According to the Home Office, extremists are using mosques less and less \u2014 and private homes more and more \u2014 to carry out their activities. \nBut the inability of the police to spot what was happening in Leeds on the eve of the July 7 bombings has given rise to doubts over whether there is much surveillance at all \u2014 or, if there is, whether it works. Beeston had a Muslim youth club, which Mohammad Sidique Khan helped manage; an Islamist bookstore; and a place known, even before July 7, as Al Qaeda gym, where Khan and two of his collaborators worked out. Nearly a year after the attacks, the Home Office admits that no one has yet given a clear account of what went on inside those places. \nAggressive information-gathering is also meeting steady community opposition. Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 lets the police designate areas where anyone can be stopped and searched without cause. Muslims say that Section 44 is being used to target them. It tends to be the first thing heads of Muslim organizations complain about if you bring up the war on terror. Liberty, the British equivalent of the American Civil Liberties Union, has accused the London Police of making virtually the entire city a Section 44 area. And other governmental organizations have put police antiterrorist operations under close scrutiny. After the raid in Forest Gate earlier this month, the Independent Police Complaints Commission arrived on the scene to respond to complaints that had been filed before the wider public even knew the purpose of the raid.\nIV.\nHow you go about gathering information on a community depends on whether you think the best intelligence is dug out by agents or volunteered by concerned citizens. This is a question on which police officers of the very highest rank are divided. Sir Ian's predecessor, Lord Stevens of Kirkwhelpington, champions traditional police skills. \"It helps when communities come out with information,\" he said in May. \"But most I.R.A. attacks were solved by fingerprints and other forensic police work. This is not just hearts and minds. You can never put all your eggs in that basket.\" \nSir Ian, speaking on a drizzly May afternoon in the Westminster police headquarters building called New Scotland Yard, puts himself in the camp of those who think that most useful information is volunteered. And that is no less true when dealing with Muslims than with any other religious group. \"After an atrocity of the scale of the 7th of July, it is impossible that we will not be more intrusive,\" explained Sir Ian, a ruddy and eloquent man with excitable eyes and a direct manner. \"But we can't do this to them, we can only do this with them. We start from a different place than we did with the Irish Republican Army, which had declared war against the British state. This is a far more difficult arena. We mustn't be seen to be attempting to infiltrate the entire Muslim community, 99.9 percent of which are entirely law-abiding.\" Safer Neighborhoods teams, in other words, are not spies. \"The whole deal here,\" he continued, \"is to engender the trust that one afternoon may allow one of those Islamic leaders to say to the sergeant, 'You know, I'm worried about young so-and-so.\"' \nIt takes no great leap of imagination to see how sensitive policing could prevent terrorism. The garbage man who serviced 18 Alexandra Grove in Leeds, where Khan and his friends made the bombs for the July 7 attacks, said that in the days before the explosions he collected something he had never seen before on the job: rubber cartons of peroxide in large quantities. That peroxide, used to make bombs, bleached the hair of the young men, to the consternation of their Pakistani parents, and killed the flowers in the boxes outside the window. \nBut community policing carries a big risk: in reaching out to people on the streets, the police may become overly dependent on them. At a local level, it can mean police collusion with whichever interest group makes the most credible threat of disruption. A year and a half ago, Sikhs in Birmingham rioted over the play \"Behzti\" (\"Dishonor\"), which many found offensive. Representatives of the theater and the community sat down with the police. The theater subsequently issued a statement saying that the safety of its patrons could not be guaranteed. As John Lloyd, a director of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford, recalls, \"The police decided they were more interested in not having a riot than in freedom of expression.\" The play closed. When the representative organizations in question are not Sikh groups but Muslim ones, which are more numerous and more visible, the likelihood of conflict increases a lot. \nV.\nWhat the police are doing on the street in East London is being replicated in other walks of life. The legislative packet Tony Blair outlined last August tries to balance two things: the harder line demanded by the public after July 7 and an unwillingness \u2014 whether out of common decency, constitutional propriety or political correctness \u2014 to single out Muslims. Proposals that didn't manage both things \u2014 closing radical mosques, for instance, which clearly made targets of Muslims \u2014 have been sidelined. But ensuring that all new laws were both tough and unbiased hasn't got Blair out of the woods. On the contrary, it has produced strange, new ad hoc coalitions against him. On one side are many Tories who have shed their traditional law-and-order views and now object to seeing law-abiding Middle Englanders scrutinized as if they were potential terrorists. On the other side are the left of his own party and the even more left-leaning Liberal Democrats. \nIn controversy after controversy, it has been New Labor versus everyone else. First, the government continued its fight \u2014 started before July 7 \u2014 to establish a new national identity card. The rationale has always been clear: to identify people who are in the country illegally, as a tool against both terrorism and welfare fraud. But the database established along with the card was wide-ranging enough to frighten civil libertarians. \"What if you've had an abortion, or been treated for a sexually transmitted disease?\" asks David Davis, who as the Tories' shadow home secretary formulates his party's terrorism policy. \"The government says this information can't be accessed by someone without your knowing about it. If not, then why the hell is it there?\" He has a point, but since July 7, the political alignment favors security over privacy, and the card is on track to be issued in two or three years. \nThe government also sought laws that would permit it to detain terrorist suspects for 90 days without charge. There was strong resistance, particularly from \"ancient rights\" Tories, who pointed out that habeas corpus has been enshrined in British law for 700 years. The government and the police replied that the evidentiary puzzles that arise when international terrorist networks, computers and tight deadlines meet were something entirely new. One case they like to mention involved inquiries abroad concerning 10 men with 860 false identities, using 2,500 different mobile-phone SIM cards and encrypted computers on which much of the data was in a Farsi dialect. The government did not get its 90 days, but it did get 28, a victory under the circumstances.\nIn a further initiative, the government sought to establish an offense of \"glorifying terrorism.\" The new crime was meant to catch the whipping-up of homicidal feeling, as when the group al-Muhajiroun publicized an event, on the second anniversary of the World Trade Center attacks, that would celebrate the 9/11 hijackers as \"the Magnificent 19.\" It was also meant to block recruitment. The home secretary at the time, Charles Clarke, suggested that saying \"Terrorists go straight to paradise when they die\" might be captured by the law. But what else might be captured? Some asked if an Irishman who celebrated the Easter Rising of 1916 would fall afoul of the statute. Not to mention Blair's own wife, the human rights lawyer Cherie Booth, who once said, with reference to the Palestinians, \"As long as young people feel that they have got no hope but to blow themselves up, you are never going to make progress.\" The law passed on an understanding of \"glorification\" that resembled Justice Potter Stewart's famed definition of hard-core pornography: as something that judges and the public would know when they saw it. The law has probably been too undermined by ridicule to serve for much. \nThe government also brought to a final vote a \"law against incitement to religious hatred\" that it had been discussing for five years. It is here that the intellectual underpinnings of the Blair approach were clearest. The law, which had been sought only by Muslims, was first demanded by the U.K. Action Committee on Islamic Affairs, a group formed to protest Salman Rushdie's portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad in \"The Satanic Verses.\" One argument for the law was that Anglicans, as worshipers in an established church, were already protected from certain insults by blasphemy laws, while Jews and Sikhs were protected from others by antiracism laws. But to the legislation's detractors, these were just post-facto rationalizations, for the law was unprecedented in its sweep. As drafted, it would have made it difficult to criticize anything that advanced itself in the name of religious belief or practice, since the law permitted prosecution of anybody who was \"reckless as to whether religious hatred would be stirred up\" by things he said or wrote.\nIt was a sort of horse trading with the principles of free speech, and it drove much of the country into a fury. The Daily Mail columnist Melanie Phillips later told me: \"The term 'politically correct' does not do justice to this sinister totalitarian project. It is against not just freedom of speech but also freedom of thought.\" She added that Britons were particularly vulnerable to such incursions: \"It's very British not to want to give offense. And political Islam is the world grievance culture par excellence. It's a perfect fit.\" Rowan Atkinson, the comedian, said that the law, if passed, would make it impossible to crack jokes involving religion.\nThe measure was clobbered in public opinion and was neutered by Parliament when it came to a vote in late January. David Blunkett \u2014 the blind, hard-line, scandal-plagued home secretary from 2001 until 2004 and the architect of much of Britain's post-9/11 antiterror policy \u2014 defended the bill to the bitter end. Many accused him of offering a sop to Muslim organizations in exchange for which they were supposed to accept the rest of the Blair antiterror program. Blunkett makes no bones about the law's having been meant mainly to protect Muslims. \"Yes, I do accept that,\" he said when we spoke in April. \"They were the primary beneficiaries because they would have been provided with a degree of certainty they didn't have before. But the debate got silly. It got distorted into whether people could make jokes about religion.\" \nIt didn't help the bill that it was scheduled for a vote in Parliament as the Danish cartoon affair was exploding across the Middle East. Gunmen raged in Gaza, and it wasn't long before protesters would hold up placards outside London's Danish Embassy calling for genocide against nonbelievers. Under such circumstances, limiting people's ability to criticize Islam looked not only cowardly but imprudent.\nVI.\nBritons have a strong rhetorical attachment to liberty, as something for which a certain price in danger and disorder is worth paying. When I asked Blunkett if he accepted the idea that terrorists had enjoyed too many freedoms in London in the 1990's, he said, \"Well, in the sense that Karl Marx moved to London, Britain has always had a tradition of taking in people oppressed in their own countries.\" This is a common view. Immigrant troublemakers are likened to Marx and Engels, and any difficulties welcoming whole groups are likened to those occasioned by the arrival of Russian Jews in the 19th century or of Huguenots in the 17th. \nThis freedom has another name, for those less willing to take it in stride: \"Londonistan.\" In January, at his trial for incitement to murder and other charges, the radical cleric Abu Hamza claimed that between 1997 and 2000, members of MI5, the British domestic security service, effectively O.K.'d his frequent incitements to jihad, on one occasion telling him: \"Well, it's freedom of speech. You don't have to worry as long as we don't see blood on the streets.\" Hamza is an Egyptian-born British citizen who was maimed during the Afghan war against the Soviet Union and who later ran the Finsbury Park mosque in North London. Foreign governments (including the United States') urged for years that Hamza be arrested, most loudly after he was accused of organizing a 1998 attack in Yemen \u2014 in which his son was an assailant \u2014 that killed four tourists. Hamza's mosque was also linked to a plot to construct a weapon using ricin. When the police raided it in 2003, they found guns, chemical-warfare suits, stolen passports and laminating equipment. Hamza was finally arrested in 2004.\nThe term \"Londonistan\" was first coined by French officials outraged at the British government's inability \u2014 for the better part of a decade \u2014 to extradite the Algerian Rachid Ramda, who had been charged in France with financing a series of attacks on public transport in Paris in 1995. Until Ramda was finally sent to France this past December, British courts held that he could not get a fair trial there. Other prominent jihadists \u2014 the Syrian-born Omar Bakri Muhammed, who fled the country after July 7; the Syrian-Spanish Qaeda leader Abu-Musab al-Suri, captured by coalition forces in Pakistan last fall; and Abu Qatada, who led several European Qaeda cells and is now fighting deportation to his native Jordan \u2014 found a safe haven in 90's London.\nThe government has lately worked hard to roll up the most brazen radicals. But a series of geostrategic accidents has complicated its efforts. The leaders of Al Qaeda \u2014 a movement created by a Saudi and chased into exile in Sudan and then Afghanistan \u2014 have apparently wound up in or near Pakistan, one of Britain's major sources of immigration since the 50's. A significant conclusion of the government investigation of the July 7 bombings was that two of the bombers \u2014 Mohammad Sidique Khan and Shehzad Tanweer \u2014 probably \"had some contact with Al Qaeda figures\" on a trip they made to Pakistan in 2004. \nLike most modern \"diaspora\" immigrants, the Pakistani-British visit their native country with little difficulty. There were 400,000 British visitors to Pakistan in 2004. All countries with large Muslim diasporas are vulnerable to the worldwide Wahhabi radicalization fomented at mosques and cultural centers financed by Saudi Arabia's government and its private charities. But on top of that, Britain is vulnerable to radicalizing trends of South Asia \u2014 India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. These trends risk becoming Britain's own, particularly among its socially isolated minorities.\nFor many years, Britain has had a well-deserved reputation as the European country that best integrated its new arrivals. For one thing, it had rich immigrants as well as poor. Many Muslims \u2014 not just Arabian playboys but also East African businessmen \u2014 arrived with some capital, hired their fellow exiles and educated their families. Britain's tradition of local democratic institutions, like town and city councils, means that anywhere an immigrant population settles, a class of political leaders grows out of it. There are now several Muslims in Parliament and even in the House of Lords. The contrast with France, where 1 in 10 residents are Muslims but there are no Muslims among the 577 deputies in the National Assembly, is stark.\nBut over the past quarter-century, Britain has seen a dispiriting tendency toward segregation, or resegregation. Young newcomers have not found a niche in the service economy as easily as the arrivals of 40 and 50 years ago did in the industrial one. Others, born in Britain, have cast about for identities other than the British one they were raised with. In 2001, the northern industrial towns of Oldham, Burnley and Bradford experienced several days of violent racial mayhem between white and Asian gangs. A Home Office report issued in the wake of the riots found \"separate educational arrangements, community and voluntary bodies, employment, places of worship, language, social and cultural networks,\" producing living arrangements that \"do not seem to touch at any point.\" As one Pakistani Briton told the report's authors, \"When I leave this meeting with you, I will go home and not see another white face until I come back here next week.\" Last year, Trevor Phillips, chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, warned that much of Britain was \"sleepwalking its way toward segregation.\" And this segregation is especially entrenched among Muslims. The researchers Tariq Modood and Richard Berthoud have shown that only 1 percent of British Bangladeshis and Pakistanis have white partners, versus 20 percent of Afro-Carribeans. The percentage of South Asian Britons who return to Bangladesh and Pakistan to find wives or husbands is hard to measure, but some researchers place it above 50 percent, and a European demographer calls ethnic endogamy \"arrestingly high.\" \nIt is not just outward behaviors but also inward mentalities that are diverging. Through a familiar paradox, global media play a role in this divergence. London is one of six cities in which The Daily Jang, Pakistan's largest paper, is published, so the second-generation tube rider who 20 years ago would have been absorbed in the county cricket scores in his Evening Standard is now preoccupied with the conduct of India in Kashmir and with what Pakistani Muslims ought to do about it. Many South Asian immigrants get their news from Urdu television stations and, despite the language barrier, from Al Jazeera. Many more are likely to subscribe to Al Jazeera once its English-language service \u2014 slated to have made its debut this spring, but delayed \u2014 is up and running. \nSouth Asian religion has changed, too. The Islam that most immigrants took to Britain from the Indian subcontinent was a pious traditional Sufism, marked by great reverence for the Prophet Muhammad and an elaborate system of mentorship, under the control of various pirs, or holy men. Probably the majority of Britain's 1,500 or so mosques have their roots in Sufism. This kind of Islam has not been wiped out, but it has been losing ground in South Asia and Britain alike to simpler, more fashionable trends in Sunni Islam. The Deobandi school, which was founded in Pakistan in the 19th century, has grown increasingly conservative \u2014 and distrustful of non-Islamic cultures \u2014 under the influence of the Saudi Wahhabis. At least since the Afghan war in the 80's, hard-line Deobandi madrasas have spread throughout Pakistan. Jamaat-i-Islami, the sectarian and highly politicized movement started by the journalist Abu A'la Maududi, has grown since the 60's and is influential in the largest Muslim group in Britain, the Muslim Council of Britain (M.C.B.). While the M.C.B. has no official government status, it does claim to speak for much of the Muslim population and is the government's interlocutor of first resort when integration is at issue. \nAfzal Khan, an attorney who has just completed a term as lord mayor of Manchester, is a Labor member of the City Council and sits on the central working committee of the M.C.B. as well. Khan recently secured the financing that will help him realize his dream \u2014 to build an Islamic cultural center in the city he moved to as a youth, where 125,000 Muslims now live. Since this project is about \"bridge building,\" he sees no need to apologize for having sought a great deal of the money for it from Saudi Arabia. \"My attitude is, if it's a good cause, everyone has a right to contribute,\" he told me in an empty conference room in Manchester's City Hall on his last day as mayor. \"If anyone in America wants to give a million, they have as much right as anyone else.\"\nAsked to address terrorism, Khan said: \"The real issue is taking a step back and looking at the whole issue in a wider context. One side's terrorist is another side's freedom fighter. How do we bring about a just and fair world, so there are not any causes for terrorism? You have the Middle East. Then America comes into the game, and that brings in petrol. Quite frankly, it has been appalling. They didn't give a damn about the suffering of people. That's one thing that winds people up. \n\"And another thing,\" he adds. \"There are many Muslims who have a question: How come America gets to decide who gets a nuclear weapon?\"\nWhen you talk to many Muslim leaders in Britain, you hear them focus almost obsessively on international politics, to the exclusion of religious, social and local political issues. The charitable way of looking at this is to say that it is a function of young people's burning to change the world \u2014 for the median age of Muslims is more than a decade younger than that of other Britons, which is pushing into the early 40's. The uncharitable way is to say that even some mainstream religious leaders are practicing what the French Islamologist Olivier Roy calls \"neofundamentalism\" \u2014 or what the Iranian journalist Amir Taheri calls \"a religion without a theology, a secular wolf disguised as a religious lamb.\" \nIf the \"religion\" causing problems is not really about religious things at all, then the risk of talking at cross-purposes is high. The \"national\" government wants to talk about local integration and facilities and role models, while \"local\" representatives want to talk about the West Bank. Sir Ian Blair, the police commissioner, has suggested broadening the interchange with Muslims following what he calls a \"traffic light\" system. The government will obviously speak to community leaders (green), and it obviously won't speak to terrorists (red), but it will speak to certain \"amber\" (yellow) interlocutors whom Americans might be reluctant to touch. Among those who fit in the amber category might be Yusuf Qaradawi, the telemufti of Qatar, who has issued several fatwas in support of suicide bombing. Lecturing in the United States recently, Commissioner Blair granted that Qaradawi \"has views on the Palestinian intifada that probably would not be very acceptable either here or in the U.K.,\" but also said that he was impressed that \"he can command an audience of 50,000 young people at the drop of a hat.\" \nSir Ian once said that \"there is nothing wrong with being a fundamentalist Muslim, any more than there is anything wrong with being a fundamentalist Christian.\" He was assailed in the press, but he had a point. What if terrorism does not come from a certain attitude toward religion but from a certain attitude toward politics? Pushing Muslim identity in a more \"fundamentalist\" direction could mean more contemplation of God and less contemplation of grievance. Pushing Muslim identity in a more \"mainstream\" direction could mean encouraging grandstanding and political ultimatums. \nThe Muslim Council of Britain now boycotts Holocaust Memorial Day every January, on the grounds that it focuses too exclusively on the genocide committed against the Jews. In response, Asim Siddiqui, the young leader of a London-based Muslim group called City Circle, organized a separate Holocaust memorial event. City Circle declares itself \"nonaligned to any overseas or established doctrinal organization.\" Siddiqui is clearly a courageous and independent man. Yet the M.C.B. still gets more invitations to governmental meetings and is accepted as the logical outlet for the community's demands after, say, an antiterrorist raid. It is a good example of how the \"traffic light\" strategy can fail. Its incentives drive community representatives toward radicalism. Strident political voices are not just admitted to conversation \u2014 they are the preferred voices, because they are seen as more \"authentic.\" If the government's top priority is finding people with the street credibility to dissuade potential terrorists, then the ideal Muslim interlocutor is someone who shares the terrorists' goals while publicly condemning their means. Standing up for Holocaust victims and for fellowship among Britain's peoples is not much of a credential.\nVII.\nHow much sympathy do most Muslims have for radical extremists? \"Abu Hamza is in Belmarsh prison,\" says the Palestinian journalist Abdel Bari Atwan. \"Have you seen a demonstration for his release? A petition protesting his treatment?\" \nAtwan edits Al Quds al Arabi, an international Arabic-language daily. Its offices are upstairs from a housing authority in Hammersmith, where the redeveloped part of King Street peters out into hairdressers and used-clothing shops. Through a security-locked front door you enter a mini-newsroom of dusty carpets and a half-dozen old and mismatched computers. The walls are hung with Palestinian posters, and Arabic TV runs in the corner. Atwan's premises are modest, and his paper has a low profile locally. But it has a reputation throughout the Arab world for reporting the news without fear or favor. Atwan interviewed Osama bin Laden at his hideout in Afghanistan in 1996 and recently wrote an authoritative history of his movement. When Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the March 2004 Madrid bombings, it was to Atwan that the claim was faxed. \nThe problem, as Atwan sees it, is that the British and the Americans have always underestimated the intelligence and logic of Al Qaeda: \"For the British, it's a terrorist organization that did Sept. 11 and is linked to July 7, that kills indiscriminately. But they never try to understand what's behind it. They never look at the roots of the problem. It's a terrorist organization, yes! But why?\" Atwan's answer is that the United States and its allies pursue a foreign policy that includes military occupation \u2014 in Israel, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Until that changes, he says, \"the current escalation of suicide attacks is unlikely to abate.\"\nTaji Mustafa, a charismatic and confrontational spokesman for the group Hizb ut-Tahrir, would agree. Hizb ut-Tahrir, like Al Qaeda, favors the re-establishment of the caliphate, the central Muslim authority disbanded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1924. Arguing that its doctrines can serve as a \"conveyor belt\" to terrorism, the British government has discussed banning the group, whose activities have already been banned in Germany. \"Ourselves, the vast majority unequivocally condemn terrorism,\" said Mustafa, who is the son of Nigerian parents, over a cup of tea in a hotel near Regent's Park. \"None of us justifies targeting civilians in London or Madrid.\" Nonviolence is the official Hizb ut-Tahrir position, although when it comes to Israel, Mustafa (in his conversation) and the organization (in its literature) are much less direct in their disavowal of violence. \nMustafa says that in talking up a ban on Hizb ut-Tahrir, the Blair government is expanding the definition of terrorism to cover nonterrorists. \"They're creating a thought crime,\" Mustafa said. \"If they ban Hizb ut-Tahrir, is it going to stop me as an individual from arguing for a caliphate?\" But worse, he says that the government is dodging a legitimate argument over its foreign policy and misrepresenting the wishes of British Muslims. Mustafa was particularly angered at a speech Blair gave nine days after the bombings last summer, in which he described the \"evil ideology\" of terrorists in a way that made it sound a lot like Hizb ut-Tahrir's ideology. \"They demand the elimination of Israel,\" Blair said, \"the withdrawal of all Westerners from Muslim countries. . .the establishment of effectively Taliban states and Shariah law in the Arab world en route to one caliphate of all Muslim nations. We don't have to wonder what type of country those states would be.\" \n\"Why didn't he take our views on?\" asked an indignant Mustafa. \"My challenge is, Go to Whitechapel and ask: Do you question the state of Israel? Do you believe in Shariah law?\"\nShariah does not quite command majority support among British Muslims. A poll in February in The Daily Telegraph showed that 40 percent of British Muslims favor the establishment of Islamic law \u2014 but only piecemeal, and under certain circumstances. Even in heavily Muslim neighborhoods, there is no great public clamor to ban alcohol \u2014 usually a telltale sign of pro-Shariah agitation. And Britain's relaxed laws regarding religious dress \u2014 more akin to the American model than to the French \u2014 have allowed it to avoid the controversies over the Muslim headscarf that have roiled the rest of Europe. But Mustafa's other claim \u2014 that the vast majority of citizens in heavily Muslim Whitechapel sympathize viscerally and overwhelmingly with the radical position on Israel and, more generally, on foreign policy \u2014 must be faced squarely. For Mustafa is unquestionably correct. \nPeople often talk about the \"diversity\" of the British Muslim population. This is fair if the dimension you are concerned about is skin color or per capita income or attitudes on the relative merits of Hanafi and Hanbali jurisprudence. But if the dimension is Western foreign policy, then there is really very little diversity at all. A Draft Report on Young Muslims and Extremism leaked from the Home Office in 2004 found that a main source of anger among youth was \"a perception of 'double standards' in British foreign policy, where democracy is preached but oppression of the 'Ummah' (the one nation of believers) is practiced or tolerated, e.g. in Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan, Kashmir, Chechnya.\" By overwhelming numbers, Muslims oppose all intervention in the Arab and Muslim world. Somewhere between 64 and 80 percent, depending on the poll you consult, opposed the recent Afghan war. \"Yes, we have a responsibility to encourage our children against extremism,\" I was told by Abdirahman Warsame, a Somali who was chosen by the Muslim Association of Britain to run the Finsbury Park mosque after Abu Hamza, \"but government has the responsibility to review its policy.\" \nForeign policy may be the only dimension on which moderates and radicals agree. But it happens to be the dimension the terrorists cite when they blow up buses. That harmony of worldview is a dire problem for Britain in general and Muslims in particular \u2014 no matter how narrow the terrain on which it is built. It creates a climate in which a sympathetic hearing is guaranteed for any claim that the real cause of terrorism is Iraq or Israel or America's love of big oil. (And if you are hunting terrorists by, say, tapping phones, it makes terrorists impossible to identify solely through the politics they profess.) \nIn this light, Britain's participation in the war in Iraq opened a can of worms. A draft of a top-secret Joint Intelligence Committee report, leaked to The Observer this spring, found that \"Iraq is likely to be an important motivating factor for some time to come in the radicalization of British Muslims and for those extremists who view attacks against the U.K. as legitimate.\" John Denham, a Labor M.P. who resigned from the government over the Iraq invasion, says that such viewpoints are common. \"Iraq is one of the factors that feed the view that the government is casual to the point of unconcern about lives of Muslims,\" he told me in the cafeteria in Portcullis House, across the street from Parliament. \"By providing a focal point for Muslim anger, it was likely to bring a rise in world terrorism.\" \nWhether Iraq is a \"cause\" of terror or a mere pretext is a difficult question. Radical jihadists have threatened and attacked countries that opted out of the Iraq conflict. And if Iraq \"causes\" someone to become a suicide bomber, it is almost certainly not in the way Western liberals understand political causation. The terrorist may already hold jihadist views. He may be whipped into bloodlust by images on TV or the Internet. He may regard the invasion of Iraq as an incursion upon the prerogatives of the Ummah \u2014 but the source of his anger is unlikely to be any supposed violation of international law. In the end, though, it may not matter if everyone means something different by \"Iraq.\" A shared opposition to the war tightens the identification between radical and nonradical Muslims, and between both those groups and some members of the non-Muslim Western left, and this muddies the terms with which the battle of ideas around terrorism is fought. \nThere is another problem. If the jihadists from all over the world who have gone to fight in Iraq follow the example of their Afghan forebears and carry on the jihad when they return home, then Britain is going to be very hard hit. Earlier this month, The Sunday Times reported that there is a \"British brigade\" of 150 radicals fighting coalition forces in Iraq. Shortly before the death of Abu-Musab al-Zarqawi in a U.S. bombing raid earlier this month, his Web site was running English-language recruitment messages reading, \"They are fighting; you should be too.\"\nA wave of arrests in the past few weeks has made clear how hard it is to separate the fight at home and the fight abroad. In the Yorkshire town of Dewsbury, not far from Beeston, the teenage grandson of a prominent British Muslim scholar was arrested for links to the 17-man bombing conspiracy in Ontario. The two brothers mistakenly arrested in Forest Gate appeared to have a half-brother involved in February's protest in front of the Danish Embassy after the cartoon controversy. Following the raid, Yvonne Ridley, a journalist who was seized by the Taliban in 2001, converted to Islam two years later and is now a leader of the anti-Iraq war Respect Party, called on Muslims to stop cooperating with the police. Muhammed Abdul Bari, the new leader of the Muslim Council of Britain, spoke of community anger and warned: \"Angry people can do anything. Angry people can even feel that they should take the law into their own hands, so anger has to be directed into positive action.\" \nVIII.\nOn a breezy evening in May, Denis MacShane, the Labor M.P. from the northern coal-and-steel town of Rotherham, sat on the parliamentary terrace overlooking the Thames, eating a dinner of bangers and mash that he had carried out on a tray from the commons cafeteria. Other members were drinking their pints and smoking their cigarettes. As the child of a Polish immigrant, MacShane expects newcomers to claim their voices in the British conversation quickly. In 2003, he came under fire from party leaders for calling on moderate Muslims to speak up more loudly against terror. After July 7, he organized Muslim and non-Muslim leaders in Rotherham to take out a newspaper ad condemning the bombings. MacShane has always been enamored of the freedom-fighting side of his country and the cold warriors in his party \u2014 but he is realistic about the timetable of the current conflict. It is almost as if he expects to win the war on terror with the same patience that enables his fellow countrymen to stand in lines. \"You can't stop individuals doing violence,\" he told me. \"You need to wear down acceptance and approval. Asking Muslims to repudiate all these Muslim causes is like inviting the Galway peasant of the 1940's to support Churchill.\" It's tough to tell if he's stressing the nonnegotiability of such a demand or the recalcitrance with which it is likely to be met. \nMacShane is basically counseling patience, as many in Britain's government do. A month before the July 7 attacks, Britain's Joint Intelligence Committee made the judgment that \"there would probably be a successful attack of some sort in the U.K. in the next five years.\" Today, British authorities are not much more confident of thwarting all plots, so they have erected a line of defense that is absorptive, not pre-emptive. It rests on harmony between social groups and on the country's ability to suffer atrocities from time to time, as it did during the heyday of the I.R.A., without escalating unrest or oppression, or the rise of extremist parties. Britain is now betting that the country will retain its historically bottomless reserves of sang-froid in the face of a threat that is orders of magnitude more dangerous than the threat of the I.R.A.; that there is something in the makeup of Britons that makes them more stoical than, say, Americans in New York about bombs going off; that the quiet tenor of the British fight against Islamist terrorism thus far is a sign of good manners and forbearance, not of abject fright or sneaking sympathy; and that Britain in the age of the Diana funeral is the same country it was during the blitz. \nIt is a risky bet.",

    "text": "'Clash of civilizations': Who's to blame? - - International Herald Tribune\n2006-06-22T05:00:00.000Z\nBRITAIN\nFrom John Morrison\n++++++\nAli Abbas, 31, a Pakistani economist from Lahore who is completing a doctorate at Hertford College, Oxford University and will shortly be going to Washington to work for the International Monetary Fund.\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (61 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nIt's hard to pin the blame on anyone. The problem with the Muslims in Britain, certainly the South Asian community, is they came from very low social backgrounds, from villages in Pakistan. The intellectual elite in Pakistan - none of them migrated here. These people had no other option but to ghettoize, and that's what happened. The gap between civilizations was so great that they could not meaningfully integrate. The second generation was born and went gone to school here, and they suffer from a quite serious inferiority complex. Here are these young men, full of energy and aspirations, but it takes a while to integrate into the upper echelons of any society. I think there is a lot of frustration among a group which feels it has not been able to get where it could have or should have. And at the same time there is injustice against Muslims in the world.\nThe problem is that Muslims don't realize that it has also happened against other people. Injustice has happened to Christians and to Jews. The problem - and this is something the Jewish community is equally guilty of - is that when you are being persecuted you feel that that is the only persecution that has happened. The Jews feel that there is no greater tragedy than the Holocaust. The Muslims feel that the crimes perpetrated in Palestine and Iraq are the biggest crimes that are happening. What they don't realize is that if these crimes came to an end, Muslims would still have a serious problem of reform. Sixty percent of our population is still illiterate; women are totally marginalized in many of these societies. You've got a long, long way to reform. What worries me is that issues such as Palestine have been turned from a political problem into a religious problem. People feel that if only we get Jerusalem back we will have God on our side again.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Britain (70 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nI don't think there is a lack of prosperity in the Muslim world. There are some pretty big oil producers in the Muslim world. I think it's more of a question of how they have channeled this money. We all know about Saudi money lost in casinos. That's what's been happening to the oil money that these countries have been earning. It would be wrong to think that Muslims are fundamentally disadvantaged. It's more of a problem of how they have managed their resources.\nIt's also a failure of the Muslims to come up with a meaningful organization to bring them together. It's only now that Saudi Arabia and others have started thinking about investing in other Muslim countries. All their money used to be going into U.S. banks and European banks. Now they have burned their fingers in the United States after 9/11, and they have begun to put their money into Pakistan and other East Asian countries. It's not entirely the West's fault.\nIn all the institutions that matter, the Security Council and the G8, Muslims are not properly represented. The Jewish community wields a lot of influence, particularly in the United States, but the Muslims don't have commensurate influence in the corridors of power. Perhaps there needs to be a seat in the UN Security Council for a Muslim nation - perhaps Indonesia or Malaysia, not necessarily a military power. Muslims do have a perception that they are marginalized from the forces shaping the world.\n3) A majority of Muslims in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (67 percent) and greedy (63 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of non-Muslims in your country (58 percent) do not view Muslims as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nThe imperative of reform remains in Islam. Reform happened in Christianity in stages, and the Jewish community reformed in the 18th century. The Muslim community has reformed in the 20th century but they have not been able to break through the inertia of tradition. Sometimes the reformers themselves have taken directions which have become highly intolerant.\nI think the reform that is needed in Muslim society is very much in progress and will probably take another fifty years. Other civilizations have the same need for reform - look at the Hindus and their extremist problem. There are problems of reform in many societies, not just Islam. Muslims don't take things lying down. So you get the jihad and all of that. There is a violent dimension. They feel resentful because they have not been able to penetrate the mainstream in the West. They have shops and they are taxi drivers, but there are not enough journalists out there. This is the gap that exists.\nIf the Muslims invested in education they would discover that this is a society that doesn't discriminate. It is a merit-based society. If you do well at university you will get a good grade. After my doctorate I am going to Washington to work with the IMF. When the IMF looked at me, they weren't looking at my beard or whether I was a practicing Muslim or not, which I hope I am. They were looking for a good economist.\nTo that extent I think Muslims do have to realize there is a long road ahead. It can't be done by sudden violence, a \"Twin Towers Strategy.\" The problem with bin Laden is that he feels that this kind of shock treatment will solve the problem in Muslim countries. It will not.\n++++++\nShahedah Vawda, 33, a health scientist who lectures at London's South Bank University and is involved with the City Circle, a networking and debating group of young Muslim professionals that is trying to create a modern British Muslim identity. She lives in Tower Hamlets, the most deprived area of east London, with a high Muslim population. Originally from South Africa and has lived for 10 years in Britain.\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (61 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nI think that there is no point in allocating blame. We are where we are at the moment - we have two sides that don't understand each other particularly well. And I think both are equally responsible.\nI think the Muslims need to be introspective and look at their community from within and put their house in order. We do have a serious issue in terms of the mis-education of youth about Islamic practices, what's acceptable and what is not. We have to look at the importation of foreign imams, which I believe is being tackled by the Muslim Council of Britain and other organizations, and we must look at general education and socioeconomic deprivation.\nFor me, a lot of the misunderstanding comes from social and economic problems. For example, up north it's a totally different situation from London. When you go up there - I am originally South African; I have been here 10 years and am married to an Englishman - I was shocked and flabbergasted by the extent of the divide between north and south, and I think you can't expect a man to talk politics if he doesn't have a job. There is a total lack of opportunity for Muslim youths, as in any ghetto, and that is the primary source of the problem. You have teenagers wanting to get back at the world, and they will fall prey to people inciting them to violence and hatred.\nAs for Iraq, it's a ritual humiliation every day for me as a Muslim when I see Guant\u00e1namo Bay, when I see the desecration of the Koran and the three suicides this week, and when I read it described as \"a coordinated attack and this is warfare.\" I'm saddened, and I think this shows a lack of humanity. People always use religion, nationalism and hate. That's why I continue to live in London - it's a unique place. After the bombings on July 7 last year, I was surprised by how fantastic Londoners were and how many people were able to look beyond what had happened. Of course it's not a perfect society, but I was expecting the backlash to be a lot worse.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Britain (70 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nThis is really an economic question. I remember seeing a television documentary on the House of Saud, which makes me think that some Muslim countries have colluded with the West against their own populations. Yes, they should be better off; it's partly their government's fault and partly trade barriers - look at Egypt, for example.\n3) A majority of Muslims in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (67 percent) and greedy (63 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of non-Muslims in your country (58 percent) do not view Muslims as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nI don't think it's all myth, but it is people who perpetuate the myths. We had a debate at City Circle on whether liberalism was incompatible with Islam. The producers of Radio Four put a speaker forward - she didn't have a very good understanding of Islam, her criticisms were very superficial, she didn't understand the basic terminology for the fundamentals of faith. To me that indicates there are people out there who are not willing to bridge that divide.\nPeople who say liberalism is incompatible with Islam are actually joining forces with Al Qaeda in an unholy alliance. It's saying there is only one interpretation of Islam and it's intolerant and oppressive to women. People turn on their TV screens and see the raid in Forest Gate and believe Muslims are being victimized, and to an extent they are, but as Muslims we need to try to look beyond that.\n++++++\nProfessor Humayun Ansari from Royal Holloway College, University of London. He is 58, originally comes from Pakistan but has been in Britain on and off since 1962. He is professor of Islamic and cultural diversity, and director of the Centre for Ethnic Minority Studies.\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (61 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nIt depends on who you are talking to. Iraq is a running sore, there is no doubt about that. I would have thought the friction goes back further than that. The situation in the Middle East has been less than comfortable for a very long time. The establishment of the state of Israel was the starting point, because it is the source of the perceptions in the Middle East on how that came about. I personally feel it's a moving situation, it's dynamic.\nOne can't talk about Muslim communities in Britain as being fixed, trapped in time. What you find is that there are conjunctural factors that impinge on how they see themselves in Britain and in the wider world. Some aspects have to do with their structural existences, their backgrounds and the evolution they have gone through and the way they have experienced British society. I think there has been quite a lot of hype about multiculturalism having failed. I don't subscribe to that thesis. In some parts of Britain you have de facto monoculturalism, separate communities concentrated with very little integration taking place. Hence the riots and disturbances in the spring of 2001 and since.\nTo talk of multiculturalism as the bogey is missing the point. It's much more separatism. There has been mistaken talk about us \"sleepwalking into segregation,\" but the social geographers dug up data to suggest there was less segregation now than in 1991. I am not a total pessimist, far from it. There are two things happening. There is quite a lot of activity in terms of government policy, a twin-track approach with a lot more consultation with communities taking place. There's a lot of legislation that has come through on a more practical level. Since the bombings on July 7 there has been a lot of intense debate within the Muslim communities themselves. It was a sort of wake-up call in some ways. The open space that was available to the radical and extremist strains of Islamism in these communities is certainly being squeezed. People are realizing that it's very damaging.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Britain (70 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nI think is a mixture of the two. One can't ignore the phenomenon of globalization and the contradictions of development. It's not entirely the West's fault, although as the dominant economic force there is a lot they can do. Also, the structures which have become quite entrenched - it will take a considerable time for reform to take place and set aside the legacy of colonialism. These countries themselves could do quite a bit more.\n3) A majority of Muslims in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (67 percent) and greedy (63 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of non-Muslims in your country (58 percent) do not view Muslims as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nI think this is the kind of clash-of-civilizations thesis in a different kind of garb. People who have very closed minds believe that there is a clash of fundamental values that has always been there and will continue. I can't understand this. All these different monotheistic faiths come from the same Abrahamic stable and fundamentally agree. I don't think that people see themselves as part of one and excluded from the other. We all live relatively materialist lives, the Muslims too. Historically they came here for better lives, to live better materially. As for tolerance, I think you would find sections of the Christian population that are equally intolerant - evangelicals, for example. You need to contextualize these views in terms of who these people are, how they view the world. You can't lump all Muslims together.\n++++++\nHojjat Ramzy is Iranian-born but has lived in Britain for 27 years and is 52.

Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nRelations are bad, for two reasons - one political, one spiritual. The political one is all about oil. The East has the oil and the West hasn't. They want it. Our countries are very weak. Iraq has made a big difference to opinion, particularly in Britain. They want to bring the oil price down. It's all about greed. As for the spiritual aspects, I respect Christianity and Judaism absolutely but they are heading toward secularism. There is not enough respect for the spiritual side of life. People in this country describe themselves as Christian, but then you ask them, When was the last time you went to church?\n3) A majority of Muslims in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (67 percent) and greedy (63 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of non-Muslims in your country (58 percent) do not view Muslims as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nAre people in the West selfish and greedy? Absolutely. People are greedy, yes. The Muslims are tolerant - it is a part of Islam to be tolerant to other religions. We had a peace walk here in Oxford with 700 people, with Christians and Jews. I am part of the committee. We went from the synagogue to the church and to the mosque. Buddhists and Hindus were also welcome. We are trying to get the Abrahamic religions back together again. The problem is between religious people on the one side and secular greed on the other. As for tolerance and intolerance, any religion has got its extremists though they say they are not terrorists. The Ten Commandments are exactly the same as for Christians and Jews and Islam. I would like to see all three religions on top.\n++++++\nBaroness Pola Uddin, born in what is now Bangladesh, aged 46, the first Muslim woman member of the House of Lords, nominated in 1998 by Prime Minister Tony Blair. A social worker, community leader and campaigner for women's rights in east London, and a local government leader in the Labor Party before entering Parliament.\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (61 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nMy perception is that when you get down and talk to people, there isn't a great clash of civilizations. Particularly from a women's point of view. I have just come back from Saudi Arabia, and I was struck by the fact that women have so much in common in what they want to change. Now where some of the Muslim women are is different from where we think we are. There isn't a clash, as such; perhaps a difference of opinion. In Saudi Arabia you see a women's elite developing, very similar to the kind of elite that changed feminism and the women's movement in Britain. So the clash of civilizations isn't necessarily true.\nThere is an assumption that one set of people is superior to another - and both sides think this. But there is more in common than people realize. We have got to go beyond the rhetoric. Rather than contributing to the frenzy, we should concentrate on what we have in common. If Iraq hadn't happened, the process of this discussion would have been much slower in the West. People are now talking about things up front. People are talking about oil and double standards. Iraq has made the Muslim world very assertive. The mayhem and mess in Iraq is so obvious.\nOn the other hand, people say a clash was inevitable, but people-to-people, there is much more understanding than there is division. We in government have very severe responsibilities for allowing separate ghettos to happen. It is our failure that has occurred. We go around blaming communities, but we have to be more ambitious. No communities choose to live deliberately in a ghetto or poor-quality housing. We have to be more open and honest about economic deprivation. It's not because people feel more secure. I use the word responsibility, not blame.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Britain (70 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nIn my early 20's I simply blamed the West for dividing countries against each other. But in my 30's and 40's I have seen more about the reality of government, and I now feel that these countries haven't done themselves many favors. Poverty has become so ingrained that corruption has flourished. I became involved in the flood relief for Bangladesh, where I'm now a visitor. I can see the politics there and that corruption is a huge problem. Where there is wealth, as in Saudi Arabia, there is equal discontent. People do believe that some countries are being left alone because they are cozy with America. It's a very complex situation.\nI agree that Islam can hold up modernization. Our Western countries have propped up some regimes that are not propagating true Islam. Tony Blair was the first prime minister to say Islam was a good thing, but subsequently our actions in Iraq have lost any good that might have come out of that.\n3) A majority of Muslims in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (67 percent) and greedy (63 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of non-Muslims in your country (58 percent) do not view Muslims as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nIf people believe these things, it isn't all myth. There is a bit of truth in both. Some Muslim countries believe greed for oil is the motivation for Western countries. People believe Iraq is about to be colonized again. As for personal values, I don't think Muslims see the West as valueless. It would be very foolish for Muslims who came here for material security to see others as morally bankrupt. I think the Muslim religion is tolerant, but there are people who are wrongly given platforms on TV.\nMy sons knew these two young men who were arrested in Forest Gate, and they were very angry and I was petrified that they might be stopped and arrested, too. I am very worried for our sons. If they are criminalized in this way - look at the lost generation of black kids, and there is a risk our kids will go the same way.\nEGYPT\nFrom Abeer Allam\n++++++\nMuhammad Kamal, a member of the Shura Council, the upper house of the Egyptian Parliament, and senior leader in the policies secretariat of the ruling National Democratic Party, Cairo\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (58 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nI don't blame any specific group for the current condition of relations between the West and the Muslim world, or the lack of Muslim prosperity, or viewing Westerners as greedy, selfish or intolerant. I blame all that on the lack of communication and understanding between the Muslim people and people in the West. The lack of proper dialogue has led to increasing suspicions and fear on both sides.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Egypt (83 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nThere is no such thing as the Muslim world. Bangladesh is an Islamic country and United Arab Emirates is an Islamic country. One is very poor and the other is very rich. You cannot talk about one Muslim world - income varies, level of development varies. You can not just say the whole Muslim world is backward or exploited or underdeveloped.\nAnd when we talk about the West what do we mean? Some countries like France or Britain colonized Arab countries; others, like the Nordic countries, did not have a problem with the Arab world, the Mediterranean countries. There is a combination of reasons for lack of prosperity in certain areas. You cannot exclude the external factor. The Arab-Israeli conflict played a role in hindering economic development, but you cannot blame only the outside factor. There are other domestic factors, like deterioration of education, bad economic policy planning. It is a combination of factors.\nThere has been foreign exploitation but we should not exaggerate that. Many countries were dependent on the role of the central government in the economy but discovered recently that it does not help the economy. We should blame the wrong economic orientation. Now many countries are giving the private sector more space. But the main reasons for lack of prosperity is lack of qualified human resources and deterioration of the education system.\n3) A majority of people in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (63 percent) and greedy (70 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of people in your country (65 percent) do not view Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nThe media and Hollywood movies are responsible for such an image. This is the production for some people who never lived abroad or interacted with the Western individual. They do not understand the individualistic theory, they explain it as selfish or greedy from the part of the West as opposed to more collective view of life where family is strong rather than the individual. They misunderstand individualism as a philosophy or concept and consider it a selfish or greedy attitude.\n++++++\nHesham Youssef, chief of staff at the secretary general's office of the Arab League, Cairo\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (58 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nI would agree that generally the relations between the West and the Muslim world are bad, but it is not an issue of pointing figures at each other. We are both to blame; we should be doing better than that. In the Arab and Islamic worlds and on the Western side, we have not done enough to try to approach each other to explain our position to one another. We have not tried to have a coherent dialogue. This is a mistake that we both share.\nOne of the examples of the lack of proper dialogue was the recent question of caricature of the prophet. The West looked at this issue from the perspective of freedom of expression and was not ready to listen to the view in relation to how this was insulting to us. Many people in the Islamic and Arab worlds also asked for dialogue, but some reacted in a violent way, which was counterproductive. This takes us back to the main issue: We should not be pointing fingers at each other but working together to deal with the problems we have because of perception. But at the same time, it is not only about perception, there are real issues, real problems between the two worlds. Partly because of the American way of addressing situations in the Middle East. And Muslims have an image problem; we have to polish our image. But also it is not only image - there are real differences and real difficulties that require solutions, real solutions, dialogue and deep discussion.\nFor example, the issue of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The American stance is not benefiting how people view America. In relation to Iraq, the way the Americans deal with it is a real concern. Moreover, the issue of weapons of mass destruction in the region. When it comes to Israel, America does not care, but when it comes to Iran, or other Islamic or Arab countries, the way the West deals with it is different. These problems require dialogue. So I do not like labeling the West or the Muslims in a certain way because it is not all the West or all the Islamic world. The West is extremely diversified and the Islamic world is extremely different, diversified and vast.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Egypt (83 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nWe are absolutely responsible for lack of prosperity in the Islamic world. It is mainly our responsibility, but it is also the responsibility of the international community.\nIt is our responsibility because reforming our countries is a great mission, but our efforts of reform are not up to the standards or the proper levels. We need we have a faster pace of reform. We need to accelerate, deepen and widen our reform. The reform needs to address not only politics, but also social, cultural and economic problems. We need to widen our agenda for reform. We need to have a wider scope not to focus on one aspect and neglect others. We need to have our priorities straight. This is our responsibility. But it is also the responsibility of the international community. They should provide help, and not just financial assistance. Just like the U.S. helped reconstruct Germany after World War II with the Marshall Plan, the international community has responsibility to provide similar assistance to the Islamic world to help put these economies on the right track.\nI would also say that the process of reform has started. But the international community has to provide the right environment for growth. We cannot achieve the potential of this region without solving the problems that destabilize this region. These are not preconditions for reform, but for this region to reach its potentials we have to solve the Palestinian issue, the situation in Iraq. Investors do not want to come to an unstable region. If you want to attract money, the region has to be stable. If you want to attract trade and partnership, then you need an environment that attracts tourists and investors, who are afraid to approach the region because of the increasing instability.\n3) A majority of people in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (63 percent) and greedy (70 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of people in your country (65 percent) do not view Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nI do not think that this is accurate. I do not think the West in general is selfish or greedy - maybe they should be more generous though. I personally would not characterize it as selfish and greedy; this is part of the aspect of misconception that needs to be addressed. Misconception about each side is the biggest problem.\nI firmly believe there is a rise in the level of intolerance in the world in general. This does not only apply only to the West but applies as general phenomenon in the world. The whole world has to wake up and address this issue. We see acts of intolerance against foreigners in many places around, violence against tourists around the world, not to speak of terrorism alone. The virtue of tolerance has to be worked on in a much more serious way because this rise in the level of intolerance is an additional destabilizing force in many places around the world. We have to learn from countries that were able to achieve tolerance within their own communities or within their own region.\nFor example, Canada, Malaysia and Norway are good examples of countries that have worked on promoting tolerance and have been making a lot of efforts. But the world is not doing enough effort to combat intolerance. The question of intolerance is an international phenomenon that has to be addressed. We see intolerance flaring quickly for the same incidents that did not cause the same reaction only few years ago.\nFear is one reason for intolerance, if it is resulting from terrorism. When people are afraid of each other, they tend to become more intolerant. Once you see person who is intolerant toward you, you too become intolerant and it causes chain reaction of intolerance. We have to face it together in order for it to subside. And there is a role here to be played not only by politicians - it is the responsibility of religious leaders, thinkers, public figures. They all have to speak against intolerance in a much more forceful way. We have to stop believing that your loss is my gain and my gain is your loss.\n++++++\nAbeer Ali Muhmmad, 38, a fitness trainer in Giza\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (58 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nBoth are to blame for the misunderstanding. Some Muslims give a bad image or bad impression about Islam, and then the Western world generalizes and says, 'Look, this is what all Muslims are like.' If a Muslim smells bad, Westerners say Muslims are dirty. If one Muslim took a bribe, suddenly all Muslims are labeled as corrupt - and not only that but Westerners blame it on the teachings of the religion as if this person becomes the embodiment of Islam.\nThe problem is that people in the West think they are gods - perfect, clever, intelligent, and everyone else who does not look like them is lazy, stupid and a liar. All of us are labeled as such.\nThe problem is Muslims are very passive, they do not challenge their image and they are frozen and stagnant, they do not want to change. They talk and they do not act, so anyone outside here could reach the conclusion he wants. Some of them have never been to any Muslim country, but they are ready and eager to believe any negative thing about Muslims.\nWestern foreign policy is also to blame. We see them coming here occupying our countries, taking the oil. Muslim countries are rich in natural resources, enjoy the best weather. That is why Western governments want to control us and take over our wealth. Look what they did in Iraq, Afghanistan and what they are doing now in Sudan. They just want an excuse to interfere in Sudan and stay there and never leave.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Egypt (83 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nMuslims are responsible for their lack of prosperity. Muslims do not follow the teachings of their religion. If they work hard, cooperate and pay their charity, there will be no poor government. But rich people are selfish. Governments are corrupt and they do not do any good planning to benefit from their countries' wealth. Distribution of wealth is unfair, there is no fair judicial system. Everybody here wants to leave, they do not think about building their own country. Look at Saudi Arabia with all the oil wealth wasted on short-term projects. Rich Muslim countries show off. They waste their money on the wrong causes. If they were true Muslims, they would not have done that.\n3) A majority of people in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (63 percent) and greedy (70 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of people in your country (65 percent) do not view Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nRegarding selfishness, based on the foreign policy of Western countries, yes, they might be. But I do not think only the West is to blame for that. We have to take responsibility for our problems and stop blaming others.\nI do not believe Westerners are intolerant, but maybe it is a reflection of how Muslims feel about others. Maybe because, when they meet Westerners, they feel they (Westerners) are more practical and they explain this as intolerance. I really do not know.\n++++++\nMohsen Hamed Hassan, 43, a physician in Cairo\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (58 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nBoth are to blame because each side does not try to approach or understand the other side. They both have prepackaged ideas about the other side and they enjoy them and do not want to change or correct them (ideas) because it makes them feel good about themselves and that they are better than the \"other side.\" The West plans its policy based on misconceptions; so do the Muslims. And nothing changes or improve because they turn their backs on each other.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Egypt (83 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nMuslim countries are not prosperous because of lack of democracy. Political corruption and dictatorship lead to economic corruption and deterioration. In countries where there is no accountability, politicians plan the economy to serve themselves and their clique. All projects, economic plans and decisions are shaped to serve the small corrupt clique, and they can get away with it because there is no democracy.\n3) A majority of people in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (63 percent) and greedy (70 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of people in your country (65 percent) do not view Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nI believe the American foreign policy is responsible for the greedy image. They support dictatorships because they want their oil and, if they just invade them, what would people think? But on the other hand, I do not believe Western people are intolerant. We see them engaged in humanitarian causes. While many Westerners took to the street to protest wars or mistreatment of minorities, people in Egypt or other Muslim places do not do anything.\nFRANCE\nFrom Katrin Bennhold and Avis Bohlen\n++++++\nCatherine de Wenden, immigration specialist and research director at the Center for International Studies and Research, Paris\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (66 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nThere is first of all the international context: Muslims feel very stigmatized, especially in the context of the Gulf war. The negative connotations attached to Islam today are felt as an additional humiliation to the problems of discrimination and poverty experienced by many in everyday life. Some Muslim countries actively reinforce this by using the occupation in Iraq as a scapegoat to distract from how badly their own countries are run. Another important factor is the media. Television channels like Al Jazeera, which have a strong Muslim identification and focus a lot on the conflicts like Iraq and Israel-Palestine, have an enormous influence on Muslim attitudes, and that polarizes opinions. Most Muslims are moderate, but the radicalization at the margins is strong and that is what is most visible.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including France (86 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nThere is a governance crisis in Muslim countries. The leaders of countries with very high oil receipts have not used that income to improve living standards of the population. Muslim countries have never developed the concept of a welfare state that we are used to in Europe. There is not a lot of economic solidarity from rich to poor Muslim countries. What you see is some religious solidarity, with some mosques receiving funds but no commitment to fight poverty.\n3) A majority of Muslims in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (51 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of non-Muslims in your country (55 percent) do not view Muslims as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nMost Muslims in France feel very French - but they feel that the French don't see them that way, because they may look Arab or black. There is the feeling that the French are racist, given the frequent identity checks by the police and the problems finding housing or a job. Surveys suggest that Muslims are generally more conservative, for example on issues such as sexuality and marriage, and that French Muslim girls practice their religion more than French Muslim boys and French Catholic girls. But you shouldn't overestimate the community identities this highlights. The fraction of Muslims actively practicing their religion in France is only 10 percent, which is very similar to that of practicing Catholics.\n++++++\nDalil Boubakeur, president of France's Muslim Council and head of the Paris Mosque\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (66 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nThe blame lies neither with your average Muslim or your average Westerner, but with extremists. Look at the conflict in Israel and Palestine. In this conflict extremists are making decisions on both sides. The other problem is that people generalize. French people, like other Westerners, sometimes make the mistake of thinking of Islam and Muslims as something linked to extremism and terrorism. At the same time you have disadvantaged French Muslims, who identify with Muslims in Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan. All this has created a lack of comprehension and communication between Muslims and the West that became very obvious during the controversy over the cartoons.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including France (86 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nOn the one hand you have Muslim nations that need to rise to the challenge of modernity, even though fundamentalists are doing everything to stop them. Muslim countries have resources, many of them have a lot of oil, for example. But in too many countries these resources are annexed by a small ruling minority that is not concerned about democratically sharing out this wealth. The West has also a role to play. Western countries often back or at least tolerate these autocratic governments. The West could also do more to cooperate with Muslim countries and share technologies that would help solve some of the more urgent problems they face related to water shortages, poverty and overpopulation. We are on the verge of social and political explosion in many of these countries and it would be in the interest of Western countries to avoid allowing that tension to grow because it fuels violence and even revolt. We need from Western countries a nonracist, brotherly way of looking at Muslim countries.\n3) A majority of Muslims in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (51 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of non-Muslims in your country (55 percent) do not view Muslims as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nThe really interesting result is not so much the 51 percent of Muslims who have a negative view of Westerners, but the 49 percent who don't. That suggests that quite a large fraction of the Muslim community in France have positive views of non-Muslims and are presumably quite well integrated. My guess is that those who see Westerners as selfish suffer from social exclusion and see themselves as victims of social and economic discrimination. Of course, there are many Muslims who are in this situation, but the fact that so many have a more favorable view is a happy surprise for me.\n++++++\nAzouz Begag, minister for equal opportunity, French government\n2)A majority of people questioned in France (66 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries or both? Why?\nIt is caricatures, simplifications and misrepresentations of each other, among Muslims and Westerners, that are at the origin of misunderstanding and incomprehension between the two groups. The reality of living side by side in European cities is of course always much more complex. By improving equality for all, we can improve dialogue and tolerance.\n3) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including France (86 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nThe notions of profit, of \"interest,\" are not natural in Muslim culture and are even frowned upon. But economic development alone - in other words without the solidarity with the poorest, an essential cultural value in Muslim countries - will not be enough to achieve prosperity.\n3) A majority of Muslims in France say they see people in Western countries as selfish (51 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of non-Muslims in your country (55 percent) do not view Muslims as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nThe cultural, social and political reference point for Muslims is traditionally the village, religion and the community, not the individual, as in the West. For Muslims, individuality is often seen as individualism which, if it's misunderstood, can be perceived as a form of selfishness. If many French people see Muslims as intolerant it is because the images they get from the Muslim world are unfortunately often associated with fanaticism, group violence and discrimination against women.\n++++++\nM'hand Chabbi, 29, of Moroccan origin, works in a central Paris market selling Moroccan specialties\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (66 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nRelations between Muslims and Westerners may be bad between governments; I don't actually think they are bad between people. But the people don't really get a chance to get to know each other. Since the Sept. 11 attacks there have been a lot of misunderstandings between Muslims and Westerners. I think the mass media has played a big role in this. It's not objective on either side, and that leads to false stereotypes.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including France (86 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nArab countries are rich countries, but the people are poor. There is a problem of democracy. But it's also the fault of multinational Western companies that take a lot from the countries without giving that much back. Since the days of colonialization, I think Western countries have a responsibility. They never actually left - before that they were colonial masters and now they own big companies and back governments that do business with them.\n3) A majority of Muslims in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (51 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of non-Muslims in your country (55 percent) do not view Muslims as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nThe French are selfish - they would probably say so themselves! I don't think Muslims are intolerant, except for a small minority. There is an intolerant minority in all communities, also among the French. But when it comes to Muslims a lot of people generalize, the French often mix up Islam with political Islam, but there is a big difference.\n++++++\nPierre-Etienne Issoulie, 22, architect, Paris\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (66 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nWhen you see your Muslim friends on a daily basis you don't think that relations with Muslims are bad. But if all you do is watch television, most of what you see are extreme examples of Islam. Islam is not the religion of terror. But people are afraid of terrorism and too often religion is mixed up in the debate.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including France (86 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nColonialization has to take part of the blame, certainly in the North African countries where France was. Western countries exploited those countries and focused on certain economic sectors, and that has left its traces. Maybe it's also a bit a question of mentality - perhaps people in those countries don't share the Western drive to produce more wealth the whole time.\n3) A majority of Muslims in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (51 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of non-Muslims in your country (55 percent) do not view Muslims as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nThat does not surprise me. Most French people live outside of Paris and in provincial towns, and the countryside people are still very prejudiced against Muslims - in part because they come in less contact with them. All their information comes from the media, and as a result they only see the most extreme examples. They hear about Islamic terrorists and about extremely conservative women wanting to wear a head scarf. But they don't see everyday life. A lot of it is lack of interaction, that's why in Paris it works maybe a bit better.\n++++++\nJeannine Pil\u00e9, 33, housewife and mother, Paris\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (66 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nIt's true that relations are bad, but to go from there to saying who's wrong? I think everyone bears some responsibility. On the Muslim side, it's too much religion, religion, religion, and they don't want to open up to others. Personally, I think Muslims are a bit aggressive and they neither accept nor respect the religion of others. As though everything has to go their way. In the end, the others don't respect them either. No one is making an effort.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including France (86 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nThey're less prosperous because they prefer to stay among themselves, in their own countries with their own laws.\n3) A majority of Muslims in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (51 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of non-Muslims in your country (55 percent) do not view Muslims as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nMuslims are not tolerant. Not at all, not at all. This is the fault of religion. It's a shame.\n++++++\nWahid Chekhar, 34, actor, Paris\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (66 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nThat depends. There are a lot of people who don't like each other, Europeans and Muslims, because of religion, but that's not always why. There are a lot of Muslims who are much more open, who don't pray regularly - that's what I see in France. What happens in other countries I don't know. From what I see it's half and half in France. There are some who are super-cool, who are not practicing, who are very open to France, and others who are less. I would say half and half.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including France (86 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nI think that there's less of an economy in the countries of Africa, and that a lot of Western countries take all the resources in Africa and don't share them, and there's a lot of corruption. That's why they're not developing.\n3) A majority of Muslims in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (51 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of non-Muslims in your country (55 percent) do not view Muslims as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nFor the first question, they are a little selfish, it's true. They are very focused on themselves, they are very individualist, in every Western country. You see that in France, but I think in England it's worse, and in the United States it must be even worse. They're very superficial. Regarding tolerance, I couldn't tell you. I haven't been to Africa enough to be able to tell you, but I do know that in Africa Muslims are much warmer. Here in the West, they're much more in the Western mold. They've been assimilated.\nGERMANY\nFrom Judy Dempsey\n++++++\nCem Ozdemir, 40, a member of the European Parliament for Germany's Green party.\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (70 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nFirst of all, being a Muslim and a Westerner are not necessarily mutually exclusive. The problem is, we need more middle-class Muslims in the West. Successful middle-class Muslims should be winning the respect of other Westerners, but instead their accomplishments compete in shaping public opinion against violence, honor killings and forced marriages, which is how Islam is often portrayed in Western countries.\nThe negative, inaccurate stereotypes of Islam overwhelm the positive opinions other Westerners should be forming about their everyday Muslim neighbors, like the other parents at the kindergarten, the local banker, policeman or shopkeeper.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Germany (73 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nThe authors of the Arab Human Development Report made clear that religion itself is not a reason for the weakness of Arab-Muslim countries. Rather it is a mix of economic, political, social and cultural factors. The lack of participation of women due to discrimination in many Muslim countries and authoritarian regimes which fail to modernize their education systems, leaving their younger generations at a huge disadvantage, clearly result in a lack of prosperity.\n3) A majority of Muslims in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (57 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of non-Muslims in your country (75 percent) do not view Muslims as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nMuslims sometimes misinterpret Western individualism as selfishness, just as non-Muslims sometimes overlook the positives of Muslim society, like respect toward families and the elderly or helping your neighbors. I think both sides can learn from each other.\n++++++\nHeinz Kramer, 61, head of the Islamic Studies department at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, Berlin.\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (70 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nI think this feeling is the result of a perception of world politics in the past five years as being mainly ideologically/religiously driven - a perception that is constantly corroborated by media presentation of important international conflicts, especially those in which the United States are involved. As a result, many people really tend to believe that \"Islam\" is at war with \"the West.\"\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Germany (73 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nThere are mainly two reasons: a) Many Muslim countries, especially in Asia and Africa, have for a long time been part of European colonial empires which denied them basic opportunities for economic development. Furthermore, colonial heritage often led to political misdevelopment that prevented economically functional political structures to become embedded in these countries after decolonialization.\nb) In many parts of the Arab world, a long-standing quasi-monopoly of oil resources led to serious distortions of economic development which undermined the ability of these societies to build up a healthy platform for a broad-based non-oil-dependent economy. This situation was aggravated by the silent coalition between the ruling elites and traditional religious leadership, which both cemented their respective prerogatives by preventing the development of modern societies - an indispensable prerequisite for economic development.\n3) A majority of Muslims in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (57 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of non-Muslims in your country (75 percent) do not view Muslims as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nModern European societies put a high emphasis on the individual and its liberties. This contrasts sharply with the much more community-oriented value system of many Muslims. This cleavage is a result of substantial differences with regard to the degree of secularization of the different groups in West European societies.\nIn general, a functioning religious belief system - of any of the three religious offsprings of the Near East - tends to prefer community orientation to individualism. The same holds true the other way round: In a strongly individualistic society, the upholding of community-oriented values and habits unavoidably provokes the reproach of intolerance. Add to this the feeling of not really being welcome because of your otherness due to your alien religion, and you have a fertile ground for self-protection, i.e., intolerance toward your environment.\n++++++\nAndreas von Radetzky, 50, taxi driver and part-time teacher, Berlin.\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (70 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nIt is difficult to speak about who is guilty. The Western world lacks an understanding of the Muslim world. You can't blame the Muslim world. The regimes are authoritarian. The state structures are very strong.\nRelations are also poor for another reason. Attempts at integrating Muslims in Germany have been inadequate. There is insufficient support for integration. In some ways, some Muslims remain susceptible to propaganda and fundamentalism. Another reason is what happened in Spain and the U.K. The terrorists were home-grown. It is very worrying.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Germany (73 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nThe structures of the state are too strong. The connection between leadership and religion play a big role. Too often, qualified people have few opportunities. It is very difficult for well-educated people. They want more space to move socially and more freedom to live. It is not easy for them. This has an impact on the economies of the region.\n3) A majority of Muslims in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (57 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of non-Muslims in your country (75 percent) do not view Muslims as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nI speak as a German. It is a cultural aspect. Yes, I think we are egocentric. There is another reason for this. Unemployment and lack of security. People tend to look after themselves and think about themselves. Regarding tolerance, I have to stress that so much depends on education, if they are German citizens, and how they are influenced by their parents.\n++++++\nStefanie Mates, 42, psychotherapist, Berlin.\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (70 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nIt is very difficult to say who is to blame. Remember the dispute over the cartoons on Muhammed. Its about respect for each other's culture and values. Both have different norms and values.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Germany (73 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nThere is very little room for individualism. If you go to school and university, how far can you go with that education? If you have no education and where illiteracy is rising, what chances do you have? You can see the huge poverty in these countries. So much is concentrated in the clans and families.\n3) A majority of Muslims in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (57 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of non-Muslims in your country (75 percent) do not view Muslims as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nYes, we are egocentric. But that is about individualism. It can be positive; it can be negative. Clans don't exist for us. The social structures are less rigid than before. We are much more mobile.\nRegarding tolerance, generally they are not tolerant. But then, which religion is? It is about having respect for how we live, without imposing it on others.\nEducation and integration is the key. Being able to speak German is essential for integration and understanding the culture and values. Learning the language is so important. Yet so many live in tightly organized families who do not speak German.\nINDIA\nFrom Anand Giridharadas\n++++++\nWajahat Habibullah, 60, a retired senior bureaucrat and now India's chief information commissioner, with responsibility for implementing India's Right to Information Act, New Delhi. He is a Muslim and a well-known authority on Kashmir, and he has been relied upon by successive governments as a troubleshooter there because of his extensive local contacts.\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (85 percent) said they were concerned about the rise of Islamic extremism around the world these days. Please comment.\nWhat has fed this kind of thing is the propaganda worldwide which is projecting Muslims as intolerant, projecting 9/11 as a conspiracy against the west because Muslims are against the west. Because of the penetration of TV into urban areas, this is the kind of propaganda that would be fed into their thinking. If you have the rise in extremism around the world, you're going to have the development of these kinds of attitudes. You have this calculated effort to make them feel they're part of one community. The whole relationship between communities is undergoing a transformation. Muslims are feeling part of a larger Muslim whole rather than a distinct Indianness. The relationship between communities in India is not under threat. But it is under pressure, because of these various developments. Democracy was doing a good job in India. It was the free play and strengthening of the democratic structure which has made people feel more comfortable and settled. And that is under pressure.\n++++++\nMohammad Arif, 40, owner of a small business with a printing company that employs 20 people and prints things like calendars for companies, Mumbai. A Muslim, he volunteers as a part-time senior official of the Raza Academy, an Islamic group that organizes protests and has earned a reputation for a hard-line, fundamentalist interpretation of Islam.\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (85 percent) said they were concerned about the rise of Islamic extremism around the world these days. Please comment.\nAmerica and other countries are trying to make this picture of Islam. Nowadays, we keep hearing the news. Always there is some news about Islamic terrorism. The media is in the hands of Israel and America, and they have planned to prove that Islam is terrorism. In India, there are regular blasts in Kashmir, so the Indians feel insecure. And they feel that if we support Islam, then maybe we will get overrun, so it's better to oppose Islam and support America.\n2) A majority of non-Muslims in your country say they see Muslims as selfish (64 percent) and greedy (55 percent). How do you explain this?\nThese views will be what people read or see. Maybe they have not personally met Muslims, because Islam never teaches selfishness and greed. Or maybe some Muslims have become only for this world; they have forgotten their teachings.\n++++++\nChunibhai Vaidya, 88, a social worker in Ahmedabad, in western Gujarat state. He calls himself a Gandhian, dressing in the handspun cloth that Mahatma Gandhi wore and living in the Ashram that Gandhi established in Ahmedabad. He is intimately versed in Hindu-Muslim relations, because after the 2002 sectarian riots in Ahmedabad he worked to rehabilitate more than 1,000 displaced Muslims. He is a Hindu.\n2) A majority of non-Muslims in your country say they see Muslims as selfish (64 percent) and greedy (55 percent). How do you explain this?\nEveryone is selfish. No use calling them selfish alone. They are poor, so there is no doubt they are aggressive. Maybe that can be considered selfishness, but did you provide them food? If you don't provide them social security, then they may turn out to be anti-social.\n3) A majority of non-Muslims in your country (64 percent) do not view Muslims as tolerant. How do you explain this?\n'You segregate certain people, keep them without things, then you say they say they are intolerant. Out of fear, they leave and go away. Segregation happens, and then the Hindus complain it is a little Pakistan they have created.\n++++++\nFather Cedric Prakash, 54, a Jesuit priest based in Ahmedabad. He is a human-rights activist who has fought for the Muslims of Ahmedabad and against the Hindu-nationalist government that he alleges to have willfully murdered Muslims. He is the director of an NGO called Prashant, and he was recently awarded Chevalier de la Legion d' Honneur by President Jacques Chirac of France for his work in defending human rights in India.\n2) A majority of non-Muslims in your country say they see Muslims as selfish (64 percent) and greedy (55 percent). How do you explain this?\nHow do you say that a Muslim is selfish when a Muslim cannot buy an apartment in the Western side of this city? You are pushing him to the brink, and calling him selfish? You are not admitting him to good schools, then blaming him for going to the madrasa? You tell a lie a thousand times and people believe it. Everyone says all Muslims are breeding too many children. I ask people to find me one with more than three wives. They cannot.\n++++++\nManish Goenka, 31, heads the marketing division at Icons, which produces speech-recognition software in Mumbai.\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (85 percent) said they were concerned about the rise of Islamic extremism around the world these days. Please comment.\n2) A majority of non-Muslims in your country say they see Muslims as selfish (64 percent) and greedy (55 percent). How do you explain this?\nIt's basically what the politicians are trying to put into the minority communities. No individual gets up and says we want this, we want that. It's the political parties who say we want to do something for Muslims. Everybody has a little greed in them. Because we see these people getting more rights, because the government obliges them with more benefits, people feel this way. The major cause of all these problems is the political community in India. The second problem is the lack of literacy in the Muslim community. If you have a community that is not well-educated in general, if they're not getting jobs, what do they do? They have to live. They have to take care of the family. So they come out and fight. That's why people see them like this.\n3) A majority of non-Muslims in your country (64 percent) do not view Muslims as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nYou're making them poor, and you're labeling them as greedy. You have to give them education. You have to give a flat playing field for every community. Once they get better jobs, nobody would become fundamentalist.\nOver the years, I see attitudes changing. Religion has taken a back seat. Now, it's more like what caliber you are. People will not ask you about your last name first. What is more important today is how educated you are. What is your qualification? Where do you excel? When we hire people, we see first qualification, not what religion is a person is. In the new businesses, it's the brain which you need. You don't need manpower. You need the best brains you can get, and that best brain can be Ram or Ali or Michael. You don't care.\nINDONESIA\nFrom Peter Gelling\n++++++\nAtiyatul Izzah, 21, university student, Yogyakarta\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (53 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nThe media is mostly to blame for the clash between Muslims and Westerners. Media perpetuate the conflict through biased and disproportionate news coverage.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Indonesia (91 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nMuslims right now are too distracted to learn from the glory of the past. In the Koran, Allah said to Muhammad, \"I won't change somebody's fate unless they're trying\" - meaning, if Muslims want to be more prosperous, they must be willing to learn from the past, be open to criticism, be willing to learn new things and also help each other. There should be a stronger Muslim international organization that promotes bonds between Muslim countries, which would function like the United Nations. I know that capitalism adds to the deterioration of developing countries, but I'm ashamed to always use that as an excuse.\n3) A majority of people in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (81 percent) and greedy (76 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of people in your country (60 percent) do not view Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nWe shouldn't generalize about Westerners. This idea that all Westerners are greedy is a negative stereotype arising from false perceptions, like when fundamentalist Islam always refers to Westerners as infidels.\n++++++\nImam Karyadi Aryant, 25, fashion designer, Yogyakarta\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (53 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nWhat I have learned since I was a kid was that there have always been wars between Muslims and Christians or Catholics. They are labeled as religious wars. But the truth is that these wars were fought, and are fought, for political and economic interests. The religion is not the problem, it's the people behind the religion. In my opinion, both Muslims and Westerners contributed equally to worsen the misunderstanding between the two groups. Unfortunately, religion has always been politicized for political and economical interests.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Indonesia (91 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nCapitalism created a big gap among rich and poor people. This has not only happened in Muslim nations but in most developing countries as well. The local government should issue regulations that minimize dependency, that support workers and protect them from exploitation. In my opinion, if Muslims nations want to be more prosperous, they have to stop using violence as a solution and start building business. Islam needs to change in order to achieve glory.\n3) A majority of people in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (81 percent) and greedy (76 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of people in your country (60 percent) do not view Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nI don't think Westerners are greedy as individuals. Western governments and international corporations that have hidden political and economic agendas in developing countries are selfish and intolerant.\n++++++\nMarwanto, 35, farmer, Yogyakarta\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (53 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nThe bad relationship between Muslims and Westerners emerged from a misunderstanding that was aggravated by parties wanting to take advantage of the conflict.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Indonesia (91 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nIf Muslims perform the necessary charity outlined in the Koran, prosperity would be easier to achieve. But the fact is, Muslims themselves are sometimes greedy, stingy, and selfish. In order to be a wealthy nation, we have to be willing to help each other.\n3) A majority of people in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (81 percent) and greedy (76 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of people in your country (60 percent) do not view Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nIn my opinion, Westerners are greedy. If we look at the history, Westerners were always imperialist and now they have transformed that into capitalism.\n++++++\nRahmawati Husein, 40, professor, Yogyakarta\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (53 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nWorld politicians and the media are mostly to blame for the bad relationship between the West and Muslim countries. But especially Western politicians from superpower countries because they often issue double-standard regulations that hurt Muslims - i.e., the Gulf War, the Iraq invasion, Israel and Palestine, etc. And the Western media often aggravates these conflicts with disproportionate and biased news coverage.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Indonesia (91 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nThe Western world, with its modernization, created dependency among developing countries. Globalism has both good and bad effects, but capitalism is destroying developing nations. But another factor that causes poverty in Muslim nations is corrupted government.\n3) A majority of people in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (81 percent) and greedy (76 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of people in your country (60 percent) do not view Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nWe shouldn't generalize about Westerners. But Western governments, with their foreign policy and imperialist ways, are definitely greedy, selfish and intolerant.\n++++++\nSujarwo Putra, 37, artist, Yogyakarta\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (53 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nBoth Muslim and Westerners contributed to the misunderstanding between them. A lack of prosperity has caused discontent among Muslims that has led to a negative perception of Westerners. Western governments also promote foreign policy that is hurtful to Muslims. Big and developed Western countries should be more sensible and wise.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Indonesia (91 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nCapitalism has broadened the prosperity gap and exploited workers.\n3) A majority of people in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (81 percent) and greedy (76 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of people in your country (60 percent) do not view Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nI think it's not Westerners as individuals, but the ideology of capitalism that is greedy.\n++++++\nDin Syamsuddin, chairman of Muhammidiyah, Indonesia's second largest Muslim organization with 35 million members, Jakarta\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (53 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nThe main cause of this poor relationship is because the West connects Islam to terrorism. But my feeling is that the relationship is beginning to change in Indonesia. This might be in part because the U.S. foreign policy toward Indonesia recently has been to look at Indonesia, being a large Muslim country, as a friend and strategic partner instead of an enemy and a threat. It is changing now because there is a lot of cooperation between many U.S. agencies with Muslim organizations, like my organization, in Indonesia. We have been working together. We are now engaged in a partnership.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Indonesia (91 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nI think that the Western world has treated Muslim countries unfairly economically, contributing to this lack of prosperity. The economic situation of Muslim countries is in part because of the economic domination and pressure from Western countries, from global capitalism. If Muslims want their respective countries to be prosperous, Western countries must not disturb them economically and politically.\n3) A majority of people in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (81 percent) and greedy (76 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of people in your country (60 percent) do not view Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nThe perception that Westerners are greedy or selfish is because of the West's culture of capitalism and individualism. It seems to me it is true that this perception persists in Indonesia. It is why we must work together. That's my concern - how we can work together to overcome these misperceptions. If such negative perceptions continue, it is not good for our agenda of cooperation between civilizations. Both sides have to work together to solve this problem, otherwise these feelings may transform into feelings that encourage a dangerous clash of civilizations.\nJORDAN\nFrom Mona El-Naggar\n++++++\nAdnan Abu Odeh, 73, former political adviser to King Hussein of Jordan, now a member of the board of trustees of the International Crisis Group.\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in Jordan (54 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nIn the first place, I don't think that this is what is meant. What it means is that more than 50 percent of Arabs or Muslims don't like the West. I think it is the West to blame because people usually reduce the West into American foreign policy. I mean, to them, the West is what the Americans usually do. To them it is the American foreign policy. When people are asked they don't go into details. Yeah, Muslims are against the West. But why? I believe the reason is this - it is a sort of reflection of Muslim dissatisfaction with the Western foreign policies, especially on two issues: the Palestinian issue and now Iraq. These are the apparent issues, which people talk about day and night. And which the news focuses on day and night. And they come to the eyes and ears of the audience, of the Muslims who have been surveyed, daily in the bloodiest way - it's killing, women screaming and yelling, and soldiers frowning. So this picture which has been going on and on and on for years has now given this impression that it is the Western foreign policies in the Middle East that they don't like. Because other Western things they do like. If you look at the queues of the people in front of embassies, applying for immigration, that's a sign. So what they hate is American foreign policy, and they see the Europeans as sort of succumbing to the Americans.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Jordan (85 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nWell, mostly it is their economic, political, and social systems that fail to make them prosperous. Mainly, the political system and the economic system they have failed to make them prosperous despite what's perceived as rich resources in the Arab and Muslim world. Of course this failure has not helped education, has opened the way for corruption, and to even simply what you see in the Muslim world as this new phenomenon of marriage between wealth and power, which is dangerous. This wedding of wealth and power produced corruption.\n3) A majority of people in Jordan say they see people in Western countries as selfish (73 percent) and greedy (73 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of people in Jordan (66 percent) do not view Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nThat's partly, I think, related to the post-Sept. 11 American policies as to what people read in the press and hear in the media about the difficulties that Muslims encounter as residents whether as students or whatever in the West. And how they are being discriminated against. So I guess this is a new phenomenon and a new judgment about the West. It did not exist before Sept. 11. It is one of the post-Sept. 11 effects. They found the West as being more tolerant than their own countries before Sept. 11. Before Sept. 11, generally speaking, people in our part of the world viewed the West as very tolerant, perhaps more tolerant than their own societies. But as I said, this is a new perception that came afterward due to what the media brought to their conscience about the behavior of Western governments toward Muslim and Arabs who live or go to the West. Selfish and greedy, this is, I think, mostly political. Meaning, I think it is emanating from old convictions that all the West is after in the Middle East is its oil. These are old convictions. The war on Iraq has set, nourished this conviction. Because the majority believes that this whole war on Iraq has been steered and motivated toward grasping the oil resources in Iraq and other places around. So this is the idea and that is greediness to them. Greediness to them is when the majority of Arabs or Muslims do not feel that they have benefited from the wealth that should come from oil. On the contrary they believe that it is the West that exploits oil fields. And that's greediness to them. To them, they think, 'Why are you greedy? You are rich countries, you have high tech, you are developed, but you are after our countries to take more oil and leave us without benefiting from it.' This is the sort of thinking. And again, it's an old conviction, but it has been nourished recently because of the war on Iraq.\n++++++\nSaleh Al Kallab, 59, daily columnist for the newspaper Al Ra'y, former Jordanian minister of information, Amman\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in Jordan (54 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nThere is a shared responsibility. People in Western countries and Muslims bear the responsibility. The West should understand the issues of the Muslims and should realize the truth of their religious and political sentiments, but this did not happen. What happened is there occurred a blind bias for Israel in the Palestinian issue, which is one of the most important Arab issues up till now. As for the Muslims, they made a big mistake with the claims of some of their thinkers or theorists that raised the slogan of the \"clash of civilizations.\" The Muslims should have understood the West for what it is as it is, not only a group of parties and political leaders that are partial against the Palestinian people. The West, and this includes the United States, has many beautiful values and has a great culture. And it shares with the Muslims many common factors related to human rights, related to justice, related to the rejection of one man inflicting harm upon another. Unfortunately, this did not happen - neither the West understood the East, that is, the Muslims, nor did the Muslims understand the West. Hence, a kind of misunderstanding occurred which is being used by the terrorists and some racists to escalate the clash of civilizations and confrontation between the Christian West and Muslim East, and this is not in the in the interest of either and will be an affliction on the whole of humanity.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Jordan (85 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nThis is primarily the responsibility of the ruling regimes. Corruption has proliferated in some of these countries and national oversight is very far from the behaviors of the authorities. There is an absence of national oversight and in some countries there is stealing and embezzlement in every meaning of the word. This is why we find these tragic economics conditions and this corruption that is gnawing at the bones of most of the Muslim countries.\n3) A majority of people in Jordan say they see people in Western countries as selfish (73 percent) and greedy (73 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of people in Jordan (66 percent) do not view Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nThis is ignorance about the reality of the West. Those who voted in this survey saying the West is selfish and greedy are ignorant about the West. I think the regimes are selfish but the people in the West are kind and tolerant people, and are not selfish. But those who voted hold this view because they do not know and do not sense but the behaviors of the Western states and regimes. They feel that the American Army came to Iraq not to rid the Iraqi people of a brutal regime, Saddam Hussein's regime, and not to establish democracy in Iraq, but for oil and to control the economy of the region. Another example is in how the United States came closer to Colonel Qaddafi and forgot about all that he had committed of crimes against the Libyans, and against the Western people, and the Arabs. And it forgot that he is still running a totalitarian dictatorship and is leading the Libyan people with steel and fire. Instead, it came closer to him for the sake of obtaining the oil wells. And there are many more examples. There is room here for Syria as well. The United States allowed Syria to occupy Lebanon completely and to oppress the Lebanese people and to confiscate their freedom and sovereignty in return for Syria's participation in the second Gulf War. They allowed the Syrian intelligence to control Lebanon and the Lebanese and to divide the Lebanese intellectuals in all places in return for Syria's role in the second Gulf War. This is selfish. The problem in the Middle East is that people breathe politics like they breath air. This is not the case in the United States. It is somewhat changing in the U.S. now, but in the Middle East people are politicized by nature. Regarding tolerance, it is the same answer. An Arab can forgive someone who runs his kid over by a car. He can let go and forgive if someone came to him and begged him. He can forgive someone who steals from him. Only when it comes to intentional killing that they may not forgive so easily. But the West is not easygoing when it comes to these matters. A ticket attendant on a bus will not accept if someone tells him, 'Sorry I didn't have time to get a ticket.' This, the West, does not understand. But in the East there is tolerance for it.\n++++++\nNadia Abou Darwish, 50, housewife, formerly taught Arabic in high school, Amman\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in Jordan (54 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nI think both parties are responsible, but I think that the affront originally came from the West. Why is the Muslims' relationship with the West bad? The Muslims were initially peaceful and they spread their message, Islam, among the world in a different manner, and they didn't go to the extent of brutality or committing crimes that we see today. But also we, as Muslims, apart from policies, are not able to show people in the West, whether in Europe or the United States, that we as people feel like the West has done an injustice upon us. Why do they call Muslims terrorists? Why did we amount to this? Did it happen just like that, or is it because there was an aggression made on us, and so we tried to defend our rights, our positions, our history, our civilization, our culture, our identity as Arabs and Muslims because both are tightly related. So if the Arab people ever see any attempt made by the West that would be in our favor, that has any kind of justice, our reaction would definitely be positive. We would see that they began to understand that our land is occupied, that our sacred shrines are occupied, that as Muslims we are being humiliated and stepped over all over the world using Western and American means and force - using all kinds of weapons, intellectual or actual destructive weapons. But if we see that there is no way to achieve this understanding peacefully, we would undoubtedly start using means that the West and that even we don't find to be humanitarian or legitimate. And this is the fundamentalism that we see here and there. I place the responsibility historically primarily on the West because they are the stronger party, they occupied these lands. When we became independent, we didn't succeed as we should have. And like the Arabs historically stood with the West in several circumstances - like in the World War, they allied themselves with them and in the war against the Turks, the Arabs allied themselves with the West. But instead, they created an unnatural body for us, Israel, which is the main and fundamental reason behind the bad relationship.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Jordan (85 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nLet's say that Arab countries especially, and they are a part of the Muslim world, enjoy having many resources, like oil. But the reason we don't enjoy the expected economic prosperity is because for a start, we were occupied for half or maybe more than half a century. If the Arab wealth is managed by an Arab will - but I put the blame on the regimes managing this wealth. If they managed this wealth in a just way, and if it is taken into consideration that this wealth shouldn't be monopolized or kept for only select regions, because there are areas that enjoy this prosperity and have achieved high standards, but they are few and this prosperity is limited to few areas. Either some regimes in the Arab countries have devoted all their resources to the military side at the cost of the economic one, and hence affected the general standard of living. Or the West is just not allowing many Arab countries to manage its wealth except in a very calculated and planned manner that they can't trespass. If they trespass, there is a red line. You can't own this, or have that. And so the wealth is being spent on certain projects whereby the prosperity does not amount to a national prosperity but the return goes to only certain individuals or groups. The responsibility also falls on us, as people, because at the end of the day, we are responsible for our leaders and regimes. The people are the ones who chose, or the ones to accept and not accept.\n3) A majority of people in Jordan say they see people in Western countries as selfish (73 percent) and greedy (73 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of people in Jordan (66 percent) do not view Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nThe reasons for this are all tied together. Generation after generation, we have seen the presence of Israel and the absolute Western endorsement of Israel, with absolutely no support for us. Even if they do give us some aid, it is at the cost of our dignity, our existence. It is conditional. This of course generates a certain feeling for the people here that even if they do give us something, which they can afford to do since they have wealth, still, it is the strong dominating the weak. And this makes people here feel a certain injustice. When the weak lose hope that the strong may support them, it creates a kind of bitterness and hatred for the stronger party. That they are not tolerant, maybe here in Jordan there is a part that says that the envy between us historical. That at one point, we as Arab nations, had invaded them with an Islamic civilization. Then there was a historical struggle - that is, the crusades. And this is a reason that may not show its real face, they may not show it, they may appear with the face of tolerance and humanity, but at the same time they still hold onto that. The West may still hold some kind of historical grudge that at some point these people were able to invade our world and culture. But at the same time, there are those who are educated in the West and are aware of what the Muslims contributed and don't have this envy. But the policymakers may still hold onto the idea that some day the Muslims were at the top and we were below and may now have a strong desire to switch this around. Perhaps this is a reason that factors into the decision-making process. They are greedy because we feel like they know we are weaker and they are trying to seize and form some hegemony over the oil. This is a kind of greediness. I think we tend to mix the concepts of greediness and hegemony. They act upon their interest and we interpret it as greediness.\n++++++\nYaqoub Rashed, 36, chief of the shareholder department at the International Tobacco and Cigarettes Company, Amman\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in Jordan (54 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nThe problem is the image of Muslims in the West. Primarily the Muslims should be able to portray the correct image of Islam for the West. I think that the media tarnished the image of Muslims in the West. It made them into Bedouins on a camel, in the desert and a tent. This is the image of Muslims in the West. Of course it is a result of the media. And it is a because of the Muslims' shortcoming in showing Islam for what it really is to the West. So I place the responsibility on the Western media in the first place, and on the Muslims themselves in the second. You don't find Muslims, you find some, but you don't really find Muslims showing what Islam is, the basis upon which it is built. You don't find this. You find Muslims tarnishing the picture of Islam - that it is killing, slaying, that it is about women walking around veiled. This is the image - that the Muslims are fundamentalists - camel, tent, and someone treading in the desert. This is it.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Jordan (85 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nThere are oil-producing Gulf countries. I think their people live in relative prosperity compared to other countries like Jordan, Egypt, or Sudan. But their economy is built on oil revenues only. I think the prevalent idea is that we are a consumer society in general. And this is what was intended for us to be so that we can be dependent on the West in the end - this is my belief. Not that we should build a factory or produce a car, but we should import the car. It is a result of calculated policies. Many factors are responsible for this, internal and external. For example, Saudi Arabia started producing wheat. It started a large-scale project to become self-sufficient in wheat production. And even though it was a successful project, it was never completed. They planted in the desert and made an irrigation system. Why was it discontinued? Why? And wheat is a very strategic crop, especially for the United States. Why was it discontinued? So that we can continue to be dependent on this or that country.\n3) A majority of people in Jordan say they see people in Western countries as selfish (73 percent) and greedy (73 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of people in Jordan (66 percent) do not view Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nPerhaps it is a result of miscommunication or the lack of communication between societies. When people see people in Europe, for example, living in prosperity but then watching people in Sudan or Ethiopia people dying of hunger. They see them throwing tomatoes at each other when this can be used to feed people elsewhere. The European and American people are kind, but there are the economic factors and the inability to communicate their culture to one another. I don't see why they would be perceived as intolerant. But maybe it is because of the way they discriminate in their treatment of things like with that Palestinian girl, whose father passed away today on the beach in Gaza. If she were a Jewish girl, what would have happened? There would have been an uprising. But look at the response of the European countries, or from the United States - they are merely 'sorry.' And Israel is defending itself. This kind of talk generates a feeling that they hate us.\n++++++\nReem Sandarussi, 26, advertising account manager, Amman\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in Jordan (54 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nDefinitely, because they think that all Arabs are terrorists and that they want to kill, and that the Muslims want to kill Christians. So definitely there is a problem there. I blame the people in the West definitely. The media portrays Islam as terrorism. So definitely the people who watch these things and don't mingle with Arabs, they will come to think that Arabs are terrorists. So the media definitely plays a role. When something blows up in Israel, all over the world, they show them saying, 'Look what the Arabs did to us.' This makes for a kind of exposure that shows Muslims as terrorists. They advertise terrorism as something Arab. So when it comes to this issue, the media definitely plays a role in showing the Arabs as terrorists.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Jordan (85 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nBecause we depend on everything coming from the outside; we don't produce anything. We should have the ability to be self-dependent. If they stopped things coming from abroad, we would eat air. In everything - clothes, food - everything. This makes a difference. And this is the case with all Arab countries, maybe not so much with Syria. They manage to be somewhat more self-sufficient. But here, for example, we depend on everything coming from abroad. All brands from abroad, all food from abroad - 85 percent, maybe more. We don't have many resources, too. But Gulf countries do, but they still depend on the outside. Even when they start projects, experts come from abroad, materials from abroad. What is responsible is that our mentality is becoming more influenced by the West. We take things from them. But we don't take their development, their ambition, and their self-sufficiency. We take the bad characteristics, not the good ones.\n3) A majority of people in Jordan say they see people in Western countries as selfish (73 percent) and greedy (73 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of people in Jordan (66 percent) do not view Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nPerhaps because there are certain resources that they don't have so they have an ambition to control it. I don't know.\n++++++\nHassan Omar Abdel Rahman, 70, unemployed, Amman. He is a Palestinian Jordanian who previously worked as a pharmacist in Kuwait but got expelled around the time of the Gulf War of 1990.\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in Jordan (54 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nAll our life, all of us, Muslims, Christians, Catholics and the whole world were one nation. We never used to think about it. I even had a neighbor, he was Christian, and I never knew he was Christian till after a long time. We used to eat, drink and sleep in our place. This is all a result of a Zionist plot: divide and conquer. They are dividing our nations and people. And I blame the West because they are biased toward Israel. And the whole West is pressuring us by supporting Israel at our cost and with no right or legitimacy. What is right for Israel is wrong for us. They are slaughtering us in Palestine, and they are slaughtering the citizens. If we kill only one of them, they call us terrorists. But they are occupying our homes. If someone occupies your home, Mr. Bush, wouldn't you fight him and kill him? You went and fought in Iraq - how come? If we fight and kill he who occupies our home, do we become terrorists? This is the doing of the West. So of course the West should hold responsibility.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Jordan (85 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nThere is no prosperity because the United States has seized all our products, all our oil, and all our wealth. All of it goes to the United States and the West. It is not about the internal politics. Look at Saddam, you see what happened to him - did he come out with anything? No, it is the politics of the strong, the way the West deals with us. This is American policy, which pressures nations, politically and economically, so that they can carry out that which they desire. So it embezzled all of our wealth, in oil and everything else.\n3) A majority of people in Jordan say they see people in Western countries as selfish (73 percent) and greedy (73 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of people in Jordan (66 percent) do not view Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nPeople think this because the West goes against our people. They don't give them their freedom or their rights. How? All their policies are against us. Go to Israel and you see how they give all their wealth to Israel. What they give us, on the other hand, is conditional and we are forced to succumb to them. This is all Zionism controlling the West. It is Zionism that is after Iran. In Lebanon, it is Zionism that is after Lebanon and Syria so that they can step all over us. Europeans have also succumbed to Zionism. Under what right should Europe boycott the Palestinian government that was elected by the people?! By what right? Isn't this discrimination? So this is Zionism controlling the world.\nNIGERIA\nFrom Senan Murray\n++++++\nSaleh Bayeri, 43, a politician and Muslim community leader in Jos, Plateau State, central Nigeria\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (63 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nIt is true that relations between Muslims around the world and the West in have not been particularly warm in recent times. And the reason is simple: Sept. 11 pitched the West against the Muslim world. Al Qaeda became a synonym for Islam, and America's so-called war on terror effectively - and some will say conveniently - became a war on Islam.\nCould you explain what you mean when you say \"war on terror conveniently became a war on Islam?\"\nVery good. What I mean is this. You see, since the war on terror began in the Middle East - never mind that there are terror groups in other parts of the world; ETA is not in the Middle East - but as I said, since President Bush started his war on terror, the battle ground has been the Middle East and the target has been Muslims. Muslims are generally labeled 'fundamentalist' and 'terrorist' and this provides them an excuse to persecute Muslims. I can tell you that if I travel to say, London, for instance, because my name is Saleh, they will take time and be thorough in clearing me through the immigrations because, as far as they are concerned, I could be concealing a bomb somewhere. That is how bad it is. They will search you more thoroughly because you are a Muslim and you cannot help noticing that Islam is being made to seem like a burden on some of us. That is why resentment against the West is high in Muslim countries. Westerners are scared of Muslims and Muslims are now scared of Westerners and so one is always plotting the destruction of the other. It's a cat and dog relationship.\nBut who is to blame for lack of trust between Westerners and Muslims?\nThe problem is both religious and ethnic in nature, but more religious. You see, Muslims generally see Westerners as supporters of the Jews - Israel. As a friend of the Jews, you are automatically an enemy in the eyes of most Muslims. Whenever the Israelis strike the Palestinians, the international community and the UN turn a blind eye or keep quiet. But when the Palestinians launch a counterattack, it is condemned by America, UK and other friends of Israel as a terror attack. That is the problem. It shows that the West is biased in dealing with Muslims. That is the truth my friend. That is the truth.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Nigeria (95 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nReligious imbalance in favor of the capitalist West. It's only now that some Muslim countries are beginning to embrace market economy policies in places like Dubai and Qatar. But even then, the rules of international trade are biased against these Muslim countries. I'm sure you followed the Dubai Ports deal that America rejected more from fear than genuine economic concerns. Such deliberate policies of shutting out the Muslim countries from equal participation in the global market are responsible for the weak economies on most of these countries.\nAnother factor - I'm going to be very honest with you - is the absence of democracy in these Muslim countries. These Muslim countries know that Western investors will only engage with them in a democratic climate, yet they hold on the old practices of non-liberal monarchies and feudal domination and these arrangements make Westerners uncomfortable and this scares them from really making forays into the economies of these countries. The truth is that whichever Muslim country you see receiving Western favors today owes such goodwill to oil. Pure and simple!\n3) A big majority of non-Muslims in Nigeria say they see Muslims as fanatical, while a slim majority of Muslims in Nigeria see Westerners as fanatical. How do you explain this?\nIt is historical, my friend. Unfortunately, the present generation of world leaders have not made any efforts to heal the wounds left by the crusades and jihads of the past. Sadly, the words crusade and jihad are still fashionable to many Muslims and Christians today. We are still living with these wounds today. People still see the war on terror as a Christian crusade being spearheaded by an American president who does not even pretend about his fundamentalist Christian beliefs. Therefore, the tendency is for Muslims to react in a jihadist manner. As long as Muslims perceive that they are being persecuted, they'll always react as though they are in a jihad to save their religion, their culture, their civilizations and their lives. But the truth is that neither the Muslims nor the Westerners can do without each other. They have to find a way around this fanaticism. Maybe true globalization might help the relations.\n++++++\nNankin Bagudu, 43, a lawyer and executive director of the League for Human Rights, a human rights advocacy organization with special interest in the rights of Nigeria's minority ethnic groups, Jos, Plateau State, central Nigeria\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (63 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nMany people believe that high-handedness by the Americans in their war on international terrorism is responsible for the bad relations between Westerners, and indeed Christians all over the world, and Muslims. I mean America is uncritically labeling all Muslims terrorists, is going around bombing Muslim countries, killing them and even violating some their sacred sites. Sadly, some of us, living worlds away from America, are made to pay the price on behalf of America. You'll remember the spate of religious conflicts that have occurred here in Plateau and other parts of Nigeria, almost as a direct reaction to America's highhandedness. When the Americans began their campaigns in Afghanistan, Nigerian Muslims reacted by staging street protests in Kano, which is a predominantly Muslim state where the Shariah legal code operates. When the bombings moved to Iraq, we saw the same protests. Many, in fact most, Muslims in Nigeria perceive America as backing Israel against the Palestinians and as far as the Nigerian Muslims are concerned, Israel is a child of the West and symbolizes Christianity while Palestine symbolizes Islam and Israeli actions in Palestine are seen as the actions of the West and Christianity against Islam.\nAdd that to the fact that the Americans are busy trying to protect the American way of life and shutting out non-Westerners from this way of life. The natural result is antagonism to America and the rest of the West.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Nigeria (95 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nLack of democracy, which also means lack of accountability and transparency in government. And these countries have royal families that feed fat on the state just for being born into these families. This creates a big gap between the ordinary people and their governments in these Muslim countries. These royal families cannot be held to account because those countries are not democracies. And to make the situation worse, members of these royal families take monies from the countries and go invest it in the West instead of making their societies attractive to foreign direct investment.\nAnd the only way to prosperity for these countries is democracy. And, of course, the West must be sincere in its support for democracy in these countries. What I mean is that you don't tolerate a monarchy in Saudi Arabia while insisting that Saddam's dictatorship in Iraq must be overthrown. In any case, we have seen that the masterminds of 9/11 were actually the 'friendly' Saudis.\n3) A big majority of non-Muslims in Nigeria say they see Muslims as fanatical, while a slim majority of Muslims in Nigeria see Westerners as fanatical. How do you explain this?\nYou see, we have had a lot of religious crises in this part of Nigeria (northern and central Nigeria) between Christians and Muslims. But I think the majority of Muslims in Nigeria, who are mostly uneducated and extremely poor, are just being manipulated by their elite, especially politicians. But ordinarily I wouldn't think Muslims in Nigeria are just outright fanatical and neither are the Christians either, and I really think this fanaticism people talk about is just the result of elitist manipulation of the poor and ignorant Muslims, who are the ones that usually get killed when these religious crises occur.\n++++++\nAbdul Oroh, 46, deputy chairman of the Nigerian House of Representatives' Committee on Human Rights, interviewed in Abuja, Nigeria\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (63 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nI wouldn't want to blame the people of Western countries or the Muslims. I will rather blame the political leadership of those countries.\nWhy?\nWell, because they have programs, I can say, some kind of crusading project that tends to stigmatize Muslims and portray Islam as violent and Muslims as uncivilized, you know. But I also want to blame the fanatics, the Muslim fundamentalists who adopt violence, especially terrorism, as a response to what they perceive to be the oppression of Muslims or the stigmatization of Islam. It is not the people themselves that are the problem because the people, the East and West, generally, they relate well. In Nigeria here, the Christians and Muslims, we have lived together for many years, hundreds of years. In my family, for instance, there are Christians and Muslims and I'm Muslim. That is the way it should be: Christians and Muslims tolerating each other and recognizing the fundamental right of another human to believe in whatever or whoever they choose.\nBut who is to blame for the poor relations between the West and Muslims?\nThe main problem is in the Middle East, which is the problem of the Palestinians. Unless the problem is resolved - because the Western world is perceived to be supporting Israel against the oppressed Palestinian people - so if that problem can be dealt with, where a Palestinian state is created where they can live and develop their society and give hope to their own people, the relations will definitely improve.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Nigeria (95 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nIt is a question of history, I think, because you have to look at history and the resources available to them. Of course, the question of democracy is a valid one, as Nigerians can testify. But poverty is not about one's religious or one's geographical location, but about the right system of government and the rule of law and respect for fundamental human rights and the right policies. China is not a Western country, neither are India and Indonesia, but they are doing well because of the systems and economic policies they operate. So, the question of development is not a racial thing; it's not a regional thing.\n3) A big majority of non-Muslims in Nigeria say they see Muslims as fanatical, while a slim majority of Muslims in Nigeria see Westerners as fanatical. How do you explain this?\nThe problem is that of political manipulation of religion to serve a particular end. That is simply it. It's so easy and convenient to simply say Muslims think Westerners are fanatical and vice versa, but it's more complex than that. I am a Muslim and I don't consider Westerners, or Christians for that matter, as fanatical. The elite simply take advantage of the poverty and ignorance of their people and manipulate them for their own gains. Otherwise, these people are busy trying to survive and hardly have time to spare for forming perceptions about foreigners.\nBut why do Nigerian Muslims take to the street because the U.S. is bombing far-away Iraq or Afghanistan, or Israel going after Hamas militants, or cartoons in a Danish newspaper? That surely does sound like fanaticism or intolerance, doesn't it?\nNo, it's manipulation. Poor and uneducated Nigerian Muslims were simply being manipulated in those instances by politicians for personal reasons. It's manipulation. Nigerian Muslims don't hate Westerners. Westerners live and work even in some northern Nigerian states that have adopted Shariah as their legal system. So, it's not tolerance. I can't remember any Westerner being assaulted or harassed in Nigeria by Muslims for simply being American or British or French or German and what have you.\n++++++\nLumumba Dah Adeh, 44, special assistant to President Olusegun Obasanjo on legislative matters, interviewed in Abuja, Nigeria\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (63 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nIt's difficult to give you a straight answer there. But I think the blame lies with the leaders of Western and Muslim countries who don't to trust each other. I mean, Bush won't trust Iran with any nuclear substance and ulterior motives are read into cartoons in a Danish newspaper and British metro police are raiding the homes of Asians and Africans in East London to retrieve non-existent chemical weapons and Saudis flying aircraft loaded with explosives into American buildings. All these actions reinforce that mutual suspicion between these two groups. Thank God, I don't belong to either of the two groups.\nSeriously, though. I think the problem has its roots in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, which has been going on for as long as I can remember without any solution in sight. Sadly, Western and Muslim interests have taken sides in the conflict and this rubs off on their countries.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Nigeria (95 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nWe have learned in Nigeria that if a country is poor, it's because of the political and economic systems it chooses. You cannot sincerely blame the West for every problem in the Muslim countries. If they adopt democracy, which to this day remains the best system of government because it encourages transparency and accountability and guarantees and protects human rights and the rule of law, and if they adopt the right economic policies, they will overcome poverty. Of course, there are other questions about international trade policies, but these issues are residual.\n3) A big majority of non-Muslims in Nigeria say they see Muslims as fanatical, while a slim majority of Muslims in Nigeria see Westerners as fanatical. How do you explain this?\nWesterners definitely perceive most Muslims these days, especially after Sept. 11 as fanatical. But I don't really agree that most Muslims perceive Westerners as fanatical. I think the Muslims rather perceive Westerners as oppressors. After all, how many Westerners are still Christians these days? It is more fashionable for most of them to be atheists these days. So, the West sees every Muslim as a potential Al Qaeda militant and relates with these guys like that, sometimes without even realizing that that is what they are actually doing. But these Muslims notice and respond in a hostile manner. Unfortunately, politicians in Nigeria often manipulate the situation for their own selfish interests.\n++++++\nMurtala Mohammed, 28, a political science student at the University of Jos\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (63 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nYes, it's true that the relationship between Muslims and Westerners is that of mutual mistrust. If you follow the issues, you begin to see that the Westerners are always plotting one discriminatory policy or the other against Muslims. This was the situation even before Sept. 11, but it only became more pronounced after Sept. 11. And if you are asking me where the blame should go, I will say the Western countries are to blame.\nWhy blame the Western countries?\nBecause they create situations that encourage fundamentalists. I am a Muslim, I will defend my faith and practice my faith no matter what, but I also recognize the fact that the next has the right to practice and defend his faith. So, you see, I'm not a fundamentalist even though I love my religion. But when they call all Muslims terrorists and call us fundamentalists or fanatics and then begin to oppress us in the name of fighting terrorism, then you see people reacting in desperate ways, including violence. So these violent people are actually a creation of the West. After all, we all know that America necessitated the creation of Al Qaeda and similar groups.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Nigeria (95 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nNo, I won't blame the West for lack of economic prosperity in Muslim countries. These Muslim countries are independent sovereign countries, which mean that they are responsible for their own political systems and policies. So, if they allow one king or sultan to have all the money while the rest of their country suffers, that is their fault. They cannot blame the West for that one. Our poverty in Nigeria was caused by us. Or, do you want to tell me that it is America that is causing the war in Sudan or Somalia? These are Muslim countries. And they know that war leads to poverty and yet they keep fighting. That is their own fault.\n3) A big majority of non-Muslims in Nigeria say they see Muslims as fanatical, while a slim majority of Muslims in Nigeria see Westerners as fanatical. How do you explain this?\nIt is not true that we see Westerners as fanatical. Rather, it is the Westerners who see every Muslim as a fanatic. And this sort of generalization is very unfortunate because it will only worsen the situation. For instance, I'll be very sad if someone calls me a fanatical Muslim because I know I'm not. So, I cannot take that and my reaction to whoever is labeling me like that is not likely to be particularly friendly.\n++++++\nThe Rev. David Koboyamba, 34, interviewed by telephone from Bauchi, northeastern Nigeria.\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (63 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nThat feeling is certainly there. The West is finding it increasingly difficult to trust Muslim countries and the Western countries are as much to blame as are those countries you refer to as Muslim countries. To be quite honest, I think whatever attitude these Muslim countries adopt in their relationship with the West, I think the explanation is to be found in issues surrounding the war on terror and the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. I'm not in a position to say whether they are right or wrong, but the perception of the Muslims seem to be that the West is taking sides in the conflict, that is the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, and supporting Israel and, as a result, most Muslims in other parts of the world feel threatened and the reaction is sometimes that of hostility towards the West. But is it a right perception on the part of our Muslim brothers and sisters? Is the West really persecuting the Muslim countries? I think most times, the answer depends on who you are asking. I'm sure you'll understand that I cannot give a straight answer to the question.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Nigeria (95 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nDo you also need to blame someone for this one? I think it is a governance question and a sovereign state is responsible for its own decisions on how it is governed. If a county chooses to allow a few members of a royal family to make all the decisions, you cannot have the best results in terms of good governance. I think if a country makes the right decisions, it can be prosperous. We cannot pull a conspiracy theory out of every situation in these countries. Do they now also want to blame the Western countries? No, that can't be honest. The Western countries are prosperous because they have systems of government that encourage accountability and transparency, where there are also involved in decision making, deciding who governs them, deciding on the laws to govern them, deciding on the micro- and macroeconomic policies their countries adopt and so on and so forth. So, I think whichever country is not prosperous should look inwards for an explanation.\n3) A big majority of non-Muslims in Nigeria say they see Muslims as fanatical, while a slim majority of Muslims in Nigeria see Westerners as fanatical. How do you explain this?\nChristians are hardly fanatical on any issue. People have protested against Dan Brown's \"The Da Vinci Code\" for instance, but no fatwa has been passed on the author despite his spirited effort to rubbish the very foundation of the Christian faith. Before him, there was \"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\" and, again, no death sentence was announced by some council of senior Christian clerics. Christianity teaches us to turn the other cheek, to be tolerant. But others, their religion teaches them the very opposite - an eye for an eye, a life for a life. So, you know who is fanatical.\nLet me, however, quickly point out that some Christian leaders, like President Bush, are allowing their religious beliefs to get in the way of political decision making. I may be wrong, but that is the perception. I think he sees himself as a modern day crusader and that worsens, rather than improves, the perception of Christianity among Muslims.\nPAKISTAN\nFrom Salman Masood\n++++++\nFazal-ur-Rahman, 46, director of the East Asia Institute of Strategic Studies, Islamabad\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, 30 percent of people questioned in Pakistan said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally good, while 25 percent said relations were generally bad. In every other country surveyed the majority saw relations as bad. Why do you think Pakistanis were more positive than others around the world about the state of Muslim-Western relations?\nAfter 9/11 Pakistan became a partner of the West's war against terrorism. In the process a lot of new opportunities were created in terms of enhancing economic relations. The majority of Pakistanis feel that the causes of their bad relations with the West are: a) the West's support to Israel; b) Western nations' indifference to the Kashmiri's sufferings at the hands of Indian security forces. Pakistanis generally have a more moderate and positive attitude toward the West given the orientation of the country toward the West since its inception. More than 70 percent of Pakistan's trade is with the West.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Pakistan (87 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nThe causes of economic underdevelopment are: low level of education, lack of democracy, inefficient political and governmental institutions, inconsistency of the socio-economic policies beside rampant corruption.\n3) A majority of people in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (54 percent). How do you explain this? Only 13 percent of people in your country see Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nThe perceptions of the Pakistani people regarding the selfishness of the Western people are primarily driven by cultural differences \u0096 people here fail to understand Western pragmatism. The other reason is the past experiences of dealing with the West, especially with the U.S. The general perception is that the West engages when they need to and abandons once their interests are over -- the case in point is Afghanistan.\n++++++\nReem Khan, 25, writer and managing editor of Gen Y magazine, Lahore\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, 30 percent of people questioned in Pakistan said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally good, while 25 percent said relations were generally bad. In every other country surveyed the majority saw relations as bad. Why do you think Pakistanis were more positive than others around the world about the state of Muslim-Western relations?\nMore like a pragmatic relationship than anything else, Pakistan and the West have a love-hate sort of a thing going on with each other. With more people in Pakistan responding in the positive, it really depends on whom you were asking! Many perceive this bond with the West and America especially as not just important but necessary; that the alternatives are all much worse and that an alliance with America can yield important economic and societal benefits for Pakistan. Pakistan is also extremely reliant on projecting its 'clean' and untainted 'positive' image to the Western world at large, and so the apparent exhibition of overt friendliness.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Pakistan (87 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nMuslim countries lack the fundamental support and governance of visionary leaders, those educated and far-sighted enough to make some sort of a difference. Most Muslim nations severely lag behind in anything even remotely close to education. Add to that the fact that most governments have done nothing rather than bleed the country dry through corruption as a right of passage, not much is going to happen to increase any sort of prosperity, be it economic or otherwise. Again, citing Pakistan as a premier example, the present ruling hierarchy evidently lavishes preference on army personnel, be they retired or in office, for the occupancy of designations that would be much better handled by those civilians who are educated and trained in that particular vocation. However, as the custom of obligation and preferential treatment plays a more than obvious role, these things go unheeded and we end up entertaining many incompetent ninnies where other, more intellectual people could serve and do justice, thus bringing some sort of turnaround to this current status quo.\n3) A majority of people in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (54 percent). How do you explain this? Only 13 percent of people in your country see Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nThree issues that confront Muslim society worldwide are, namely, the security threat, illiteracy and poverty. Political leaders from all over the world are seen as targeting them socially, educationally, economically and politically to preserve their own standing. Many people in Pakistan perceive selfishness on the part of Westerners because we're still very dependent on them for everything, from monetary aid to development. Muslims are not a monolithic entity, nor are their problems simply about the mosque or personal law; rather they are more concerned about basic human rights. With sanctions slapped upon them at almost anything deemed 'incorrect' by Western nations, Muslims perceive this as an infringement of their basic rights, especially when we remain only in the position to accept help and not offer any sort of defense. Still very much a bonded nuclear family with small-town mentality, we haven't branched out to embrace independence and hence our predicament remains unsolved.\n++++++\nSadia Omar, 34, housewife, Rawalpindi\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, 30 percent of people questioned in Pakistan said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally good, while 25 percent said relations were generally bad. In every other country surveyed the majority saw relations as bad. Why do you think Pakistanis were more positive than others around the world about the state of Muslim-Western relations?\nI dont think the relations are good at all. Look, on the state level, I don't think we stand anywhere, but on a person-to-person interaction it's much better. First of all, we need to take into account that even if relations are good, they are good on our side, not from the Western side. They perceive Muslims as terrorists. Secondly, the West has an expansionist policy and they want to get hold of this portion of the world. And it's the rule of nature that you befriend people who are similar to you. They can't treat Muslims equally and will never be friends with us.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Pakistan (87 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nWe have our own weaknesses. Lack of proper leadership. Depending on the West from Day One. This dependence has created a vacuum in everything. We have no proper infrastructure. Again dependence on the West. They provide us loans and it is a vicious circle now. We lag behind in many things. It is sad but true.\n3) A majority of people in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (54 percent). How do you explain this? Only 13 percent of people in your country see Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nI think everyone is selfish and tolerant at the same time. We can't blame them for that. Selfish people can be found any where. It is a personal trait. I dont want to blame anyone. If someone is tolerant toward us, great, thanks a lot!\n++++++\nMuhammad Adnan, 37, government employee, Islamabad\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, 30 percent of people questioned in Pakistan said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally good, while 25 percent said relations were generally bad. In every other country surveyed the majority saw relations as bad. Why do you think Pakistanis were more positive than others around the world about the state of Muslim-Western relations?\nI would want to know who were the recipients of the survey? Like, if it were taken at an educational institution then it makes sense. The majority saying relations are good doesn't sound very true. But I think we have always been keen to take credit for building bridges between Islam and the West. That's probably why we feel it's important to have good relations because we feel that is the only bargaining chip we have to gain international significance -- as a moderate Islamic state that enjoys good relations with the U.S. and Western Europe.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Pakistan (87 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nI think it is the lack of cohesion and therefore of complementarity among the Muslim economies. Lets face it, the Saudis would rather import clothes from the US rather than from Pakistan. Similarly the UAE would rather import fish from Europe than Bangladesh.If we don't help each other's trade, the West is surely not going to protect our interests either. What we need is an assessment of what our economic strengths are, and how they can be consumed to the best advantage of the poor Islamic states.\n3) A majority of people in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (54 percent). How do you explain this? Only 13 percent of people in your country see Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nI think blaming the West for being selfish is unfair. If you analyze things from human behavior, the West is only talking of what suits it best. We in the Islamic world talk of fairness only because we are at the receiving end. The truth is that human beings have an intrinsic drive for self preservation. That is what we see echoing in the actions of the West today. Had human beings been tolerant, we would never have had the terrible wars of the 20th century.\n++++++\nMuhammad Nasir, 24, student of international relations, Islamabad\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, 30 percent of people questioned in Pakistan said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally good, while 25 percent said relations were generally bad. In every other country surveyed the majority saw relations as bad. Why do you think Pakistanis were more positive than others around the world about the state of Muslim-Western relations?\nPakistanis have never been virulently anti-West. The occasional periods of acrimony towards the West were short-lived. Most of the Pakistani leaders have had good relations with the Western countries and this translates into a more amenable opinion in the masses. Also, currently, President Pervez Musharraf is riding a tide of global praise. He has been praised by both the U.S. and Europe for his role against terror. So I guess people see that as a good sign.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Pakistan (87 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nLots of factors. Lack of institutions. Lack of democracy. Lack of consistent policies. Most of the Muslim countries are gripped by dictatorships or they are kingdoms. Societies have not functioned properly, are dysfunctional. I think lack of progress in science is a key factor too. Muslims lag far behind in science and technology and this hinders their capability to flourish. We have the raw materials, we have the labor but we do not have the technology. Then, there is corruption, nepotism. Also, there is a feeling that West is exploiting our resources and we are incapacitated to counter Western domination.\n3) A majority of people in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (54 percent). How do you explain this? Only 13 percent of people in your country see Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nI guess this comes from the perception that the West has an expedient and self-serving policy. Since the notion that Western policies are intrinsically anti-Islamic is widespread, any act by West is scrutinized deeply and more often than not is perceived to be biased and prejudiced towards the Muslims. Also, many would say that the West itself has double standards. It preaches tolerance but bans the scarf in France, for example. Muslims generally live under fear. One terrorist turns out to be a Muslim, and then the whole community is castigated.\nRUSSIA\nFrom Sophia Kishkovsky\n++++++\nAleksei Malashenko, 55, scholar-in-residence, Carnegie Moscow Center, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He co-chairs the Religion, Society and Security Program and is an expert on Islam in former Soviet Union.\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (53 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nI will try to be objective. I think the situation is to blame. Determining who is more or less to blame is a favorite pastime in the West and in the Muslim East and each blames the other. It is an interesting statistic. From 72 to 75 percent in Europe have a negative attitude to Islamic countries. The situation is best of all in Poland. Fifty-one percent think negatively of Muslims and immigrants. I think the situation is to blame. Both sides were not ready for this. There's no doubt that radicalism will grow. Reform in the Muslim world on a nationalist basis has failed. The nationalist basis has failed and been replaced by Islam. In the process of globalization, the Muslim world has lost to the West. What is happening is compensation. We can't repeat your path, so we'll build our own. We don't like that you crush Muslims in Iraq, Iran and Palestine. This is a symmetrical answer. What we're observing is an inferiority complex. We can't catch up with you, so we'll punish you. Since America is the main country, it is punished first of all. Also the Iraq, Palestine conflicts have a deep Islamic subtext, Islamic resistance, Hamas. Before it was Arafat -- he failed. Islamic resistance is being formed in Iraq, Uzbekistan. We can't stop this tendency. So aside from battle, we must negotiate. Islam is different from the West.\n2) A majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Russia, think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nPoverty is absence of reform. The Gulf and other countries are comparable to Russia. Money is not enough. You have to have a market economy, move away from government control. Turkmenistan is a prime example. You can't be richer -- or poorer -- than that. If you go there, you'll see. Economic reform without political reform is utopia. The Muslim world isn't ready for political reform. Everyone is for democracy. In Egypt 70 percent are for democracy. Even in Saudi Arabia they are for democracy. But when actual elections are held, it turns out they are controlled by the state or the ruling elite. They won't go for real democracy. However paradoxical it may seem, where there is a lot of democracy there is a big chance for radicals. Look at Iran. Ahmadinejad won almost honestly. So did Hamas.\n3) A majority of non-Muslims in your country (72 percent) view Muslims as fanatical. How do you explain this?\nI don't know where you got this number 72 percent. In Russia, 25-30 percent have an extremely negative view, think they are fanatical, and in 2005 another 25-30 percent thought they are more likely to be fanatical. So the negative view is about 50 percent. I'm working with these numbers. There are the following interesting examples. There was a question, would you object to your daughter marrying a Muslim. I think 39 percent said they would object. If their son were to marry a Muslim, 25 percent said they would object. The attitude to Islam in Russia is not clear. There are extremely varying numbers. As for Chechnya, in 2004 only 4 percent thought that terrorism there stemmed from Islam. Most people think its revenge against federal forces. However, they do think that the attitude of Islam to the Orthodox Church is even worse than that of the Catholics to Orthodoxy. In the last 10 years the attitude towards Islam in Russia is more tolerant than in the West. The numbers here change from month to month. Last winter 35 percent thought that Islamic terrorism is the main enemy. In the fall it was 58 percent. It's hard to say why. Maybe the events in Nalchik.\n++++++\nSergei Markov, 48, director of the Institute of Political Studies and deputy chairman of the Public Chamber Commission on International Cooperation and Public Diplomacy, a Kremlin-organized \"civil society\" body.\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (53 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nThe answer is general. When a pedestrian and car crash, who to blame? Even if pedestrian did something wrong, the driver always wrong because he is stronger. When weak and strong collide, the strong one is wrong. We should have built a system where there is no conflict. The strong West is to blame. To be concrete, the thing is that the West built such a system of relations that leads people to work the same, let's say, in the Arab world and West, but consumption in Western world is many times higher. This egotistical national policy worked as normal colonial policy 100 years ago, but in the modern global world it doesn't work. The modern world is more general. The same situation has arisen that existed within Western countries 100 years ago. That is, the elite has huge resources under its control and the working class has very low standards of consumption and almost no political rights. Then this led to rebellion and social, communist revolutions. It gave rise to society of equal rights. Arab and other poor countries demand the same. The people demand this, not the emirs, who are more part of Western world. Not presidents. They more part of Western world. But these people, they demand a new world order like that in the West: normal protection of labor, real electoral freedoms, health care guarantees. All those things that poor European workers demanded 100 years ago are now demanded by poor Arab countries. The result is the same. First the rich reject the demands, and will say this is pure terrorism. We will decide this by war. They will fight by military means, like they imprisoned socialists in Europe. Then by measure of how demands gain strength, by the damage to Western countries, they will negotiate. Peace can't be sustained if it's unjust. It's clear that distribution is not fair, but the amount of work is equal. What, don't people work in the Arab world? They may work more. It's very unequal. Any supporter of the current world order will give you a million arguments, and say that legally all is right. But the fundamental fact remains. The level of income of presidents and sheikhs, they are in the Western world. The population's income is much less than that in countries of the Western so-called golden billion. They demand much more equality, not just material, but socio-cultural. Today's direct propaganda of Western mass culture is unfair. At times it is direct propaganda of vice.\n2) A majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Russia, think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nThe main reason is that their elite thinks how to steal rather than rule. Their elite ois more connected with West than with their people. Their systems are deeply undemocratic, with economic exploitation. But economic exploitation is not main thing. The main thing is that the West won't help find an effective model of development, like it helped find for South Korea and Japan. They're not fighting with the West. They need to be help to find models of development. Europe and the U.S. are lucky in history. They found a good model of development earlier. But instead of helping other countries find more effective models of development, they're trying to use ideology of free flow of capital as instrument of pumping income to their countires. That is the main sin. It's apparent. I am a full supporter of the leading states not leaving Arab countries, but maximally coming into them, establishing effective regimes. Not full liberal economic regimes. Completely liberal economies gives all resources to strong corporations. The main criteria should be the growth of well-being of the population. Not a less active but a more active policy is needed, to help find more effective models of development.\n3) A majority of non-Muslims in your country (72 percent) view Muslims as fanatical. How do you explain this?\nI explain this by the fact that on TV screens see mostly fanatical Muslims. The majority, not fanatics remain off TV screens. That's the main reason. The second reason is that Islam is politically going through a period of seething, of political development. It took the niche of the political ideology of poor, deprived nations -- The role that communism and socialism played 100, 150 years ago. This political drive leads not just to some people radicalizing, but large numbers radicalizing. It's known that Muslims wear the hijab. This is evidence of radicalism. Now Islam is politicized. So when people say that Muslims are more radical than Catholics, Protestants, Orthodox, Buddhists, Confucians, this is true, but not because Islam is different, but because Islam in last 20 years has a particular political role. As for Russia, Muslims are more religious than Orthodox, Catholics, Buddhists and so forth. But the radicalism of Russian Muslims much lower than the radicalism of Muslims of other countries. This is connected first of all with the fact that Russian Muslims don't live worse than peasants. In the Mediterranean it's clear that they live worse than peasants. There's another reason to which for some reason few pay attention. Russian has huge experience with peaceful cooperation of Christianity and Islam. Few write of this. I would call on Bush, Blair, Chirac, Schroeder to ask Putin to organize seminars on cooperation of Christians and Islam. The West, if it wants a good experience, must study very carefully example of cooperation. In Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, most of the Northern Caucasus, relations are not bad. On the whole it's very positive. The Volga Muslims of Russia for today is a unique expample.\"\n++++++\nRafik Moukhametshin, 50, director of the Department of Islamic Studies of the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences of Tatarstan, Kazan.\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (53 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nI think that the question, to say who is to blame, is not quite correct. I'll explain why. We're talking about two civilizations, Muslim and Western European. They always developed independently. They have their own values. It's natural that today they are maybe not opposite, but don't completely understand each other. The process of globalization means it's natural that relations between the Muslim world and Western Europe are all closer and closer, so mutual irritation growing. In this case, to say that Muslims or W. Europe to blame us not completely correct. Simply, as representatives of two civilizations, they sometimes don't understand each other. Sometimes they don't want to. It's the way of life, mentality. Subjective factor exists. Maybe in conditions of globalization, there should be more tolerance. In this case objective side, the standoff of civilizations predominates. So the world itself is to blame. Any civilization is self-sufficient. So as to defend its values, it has to resist. This is an objective so as to defend values, tries to protivostoyak. This objective. It's natural. I can't say that it's an artificially created situation.\n2) A majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Russia, think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nI think I can formulate who to blame in this process. Western. Europe is relatively well off from an economic point of view. Muslim countries are less well off. The problem was not created today. Almost all Muslim countries were colonies. West negatively affected their development. The backwardness of countries is connected to colonial past. As a Muslim I think this shouldn't be all blamed on external factors. We Muslims sometimes say the West is to blame, that it's aggressive. Of course this is so. We see this with the example of Iraq, the attempts to regulate the Iran question by forceful means. There is interference. But you have to look at what is happening internally. The question is not simple. I think in this case, maybe some Muslims won't understand me. This is my point of view. Religion is self-sufficient. Any religion, including Islam, is conservative. It's focused on preserving its main dogmatic values. Any religion must be conservative. Society is a political and social institute. Society must be mobile. In connection with this, there is a contradiction. In the Muslim world, there is no clear division between religious and secular. Religion determines both the theological and political. Religion is directed at preserving the fundamental bases. But society must develop. From this point of view I think the Muslim world is experiencing crisis. I think that the Muslim world has not developed a model of development, what was solved in the West in the 19th century, the French Revolution, the bourgeois revolutions. They chose a secular model. Religion is not pushed out of society, but its sphereis clearly defined. It is the spiritual. This model turned out to be quite productive. This enabled the quite effective social and economic development of the West. In Islam its almost impossible to use, since Islam doesn't recognize the division between spiritual and secular. Aside from external factors that play a great role in Islam, need to think of internal factors that out a break on development.\n3) A majority of non-Muslims in your country (72 percent) view Muslims as fanatical. How do you explain this?\nThat's an illusion created in the whole world that Muslims are fanatics. Here it's not quite so. Although Muslims, Muslim civilization, Muslim world in difficult socio-economic situation, spiritual situation. Muslims react very painfully to processes in Muslim world. Such a reaction may be an inferiority complex, the fact that many social problems are not solved. This results in Muslims using religion as an instrument to solve their probs. For Muslims, religion is in first place in solving social and political problems. I think this is not completely correct, since to solve social and political problems one must use social and political instruments. Muslims try to solve problems using the religious factor, so religion is often in the first plan. So, it seems that Muslims are fanatics. I think that the external factor plays a role here too. Muslim countries are relatively backward. Muslims try to use all socio-economic and religious factors in solving problems. When that is not enough, then there is an emotional reaction, and this is shown in religion. In the Muslim world. This creates an illusion that Muslims are fanatics. What fanatics? My understanding is that a fanatic is a person who uses religion to solve problems. I think objectively that Muslims, not finding other means, are forced to rely on religion. This is always case when society has no other way out. It turns to religion. The West doesn't use religion in this way. I think that in Russia there has been no process yet of division between Muslims of Russia and Muslims of the rest of the world. I think that what they see in Iraq they apply to Russia. There is talk of an Islamic revival in Russia. The Islamic revival in Russias is chaotic. The revival has taken place with the values that exist in Saudia Arabia. Today's Muslims were trained by teachers from there, then students went to study there. Russian Muslims are more tolerant, but Russian Islam still doesn't have its clear face. Although it did have one before the revolution. There was Russian Islam with traditional values. Unfortunately many traditions have been lost. Unfortunately tolerant tendencies are returning very slowly. I understand those non-Muslims who associate Muslims of Russia with all Muslims. So their answer is to some extent justified. I think they don't see a difference between Muslims of Russia and of the world. If they think they are fanatics, they think they are fanatics everywhere, so in Russia too.'\n++++++\nKarina Cherniak, 57, Orthodox Church youth worker, Moscow\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (53 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nI would probably say it's hard to answer this question. I don't have a specific answer. There are historic subtexts. As always in such situations probably both sides have grievances against the other, painful historical memory. If one speaks of conflicts on the territory of the former Soviet Union, I think these are echoes of Stalin's policies. It's hard to speak of the whole world, of U.S. policies. Here, I think Chechnya is the result of Stalin's horrible deportation of people. There is hatred from their side because of this. There wasn't a bad attitude to them before the first and second Chechen war. Was anti-Semitism, as you know. Now no such anti-Semitism, aside from skinheads. Now bad attitude to people from the Caucasus, but they're not just Muslims. They're hungry. They come here to work, like many people from the Soviet Union let for West. Then there are always such things as prejudices. It's hard to find objective reasons. I wouldn't speak of such reasons here, aside from Stalin's extermination of people.\n2) A majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Russia, think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nIf we speak of oil, it never belongs to the people. To speak of oil-rich countries having to be richer, oil never belongs to the people. If you say that oil magnates should work with people, in such countries they never worry so much about the well being of people, unemployment. Also there is a high birth rate. In some places, there are the results of British supremacy. Of course it would be ideal if oil companies gave more to health care and education. It's not like this in all countries. As far as I know, the Arab emirates have a high standard of living. The situation varies.\n3) A majority of non-Muslims in your country (72 percent) view Muslims as fanatical. How do you explain this?\nWhat period of time does this regard?. Historically, we can speak of Armenian genocide, the policy of Turkey to neighboring countries, if we speak of Turkey. Then why not speak of the Soviet Union and Hitler's Germany? Unfortunately there are such waves of aggression. Yes, there was Soviet ideology, fascist ideology. It doesn't necessarily go to the roots. Their faith is very Islamocentric. It wasn't always like that. It was tolerant before. In the 20th century this aggressive tendency has grown. It is used as an instrument. Die for Allah. Such heroism is rewarded. This doesn't necessarily mean attack. It can mean defense of the Muslim state. In Russia, we also had ideas like give you life for the tsar, for the Soviet state. This was encouraged by this state. In Muslim societies, religion functions as ideology. It's hard to say when religion started to work as ideology. This has penetrated deeply. It's hard to separate from religious doctrine. I have a friend. His son is an active Orthodox Christian. The father is an active Muslim. He became aggressive. We were friends in youth. He became an aggressive Muslim. He's Tatar. He's engaged in politics. He's aggressive to others. It's sad. The views in the family have diverged, with friends. But I can also say that my relations with those who have became ultra-Orthodox Christians have worsened.\n++++++\nTamara Kantayeva, 49, Chechen refugee in Moscow, school teacher\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (53 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nYou know, it's such a complicated question, but I think that Western countries, whatever the situation may be, they still support Muslims. They help them, receive them in their countries. Give those people who ask humanitarian help. Every country has its social problems. Maybe not every Muslim can find what they're looking for. In terms of attitude to people, Western countries try to observe their rights, help them. I think that any faith, true faith, doesn't got over into politics. It shouldn't be political. It should be in people's souls. Any church and mosque should encourage good relations. I think that this lack of understanding between peoples, that supposedly from Muslims you can expect anything. although pure Muslim faith doesn't bring terror, it's purely political. There are different customs, different social conditions. Ihink there should be some dialogue so people understand each other. There needs to be dialogue between these countries. If things are done openly, people understand. If it's done in the shadows, hisprovokes people. Such political questions, behavior, provoke people. That's what I think. It's hard to answer.\n2) A majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Russia, think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nIndeed, many Muslim countries are located in good geographical conditions. They have either oil, or natural resources. Those rulers who are in these countries, they simply don't work for the good of the people. The people get impoverished because of this. They don't spiritually develop the people. If they did, they would understand that people could be just and loyal everywhere. The authorities there don't disbribute resources, don't encourage spiritual growth. Those who are in power, who are close to resources, they encircle themeselves in wealth. There are children, very poor people, no attention is paid to them. They see on TV that everything is different, that they can educate their children, find progress in other countries. They flee to other countries. There are examples in history of what war leads to. Many innocent people affected. We need to find other methods, to fight this. Take the example of Chechnya: some authority comes, then another, but there's anarchy, because there is no authority that would rule people. People act each on their own. It can be hard to establish unified law, very hard to establish.\n3) A majority of non-Muslims in your country (72 percent) view Muslims as fanatical. How do you explain this?\nI would say that young people are not educated. Young people are not educated in a moral spirit that says that religion is the culture of the people. That's why they behave like this, and will. Skinheads. This all explained to them like this. They look at Muslims like fanatics. They're not spiritually ready, morally. School doesn't give them this today. The goal is simply to finish school. The goal of graduating thinking people is almost absent. In families too. That's why they look at us like fanatics. They think that it is a faith the brings death and violence, that the Koran says the infidels must be killed. There is nothing on television that would should two people, a Christian and someone from a mosque, that would give them spiritual understanding. Education gives a lot to people. People would calm down and not look at each other with hatred. That's how I educated my children about how treat other people. I think human life is the main value. We must value person and their spirituality.\nSPAIN\nFrom Renwick McLean\n++++++\nInocencio Arias, Spain's consul general in Los Angeles and its former ambassador to the United Nations\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (61 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nUntil recently the Spaniards would not have defined the relations as \"bad.\" Several terrorist attacks in different places carried out by fundamentalist Islamic people have changed completely the perception in Spain.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Spain (81 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nSpain has the same gross national product as all the Arab countries combined. Most of them reached independence two generations ago, so it is difficult to blame the Western world, or imperialism, for the economic stagnation. Their sociological system, their laws, their education are to blame. It is a pity because if you know them you realize that from the human point of view their potential is enormous.\n3) A majority of Muslims in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (50 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of non-Muslims in your country (70 percent) do not view Muslims as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nThey are right. Western societies are somewhat selfish. But don't urban and developed Islamic societies incur in the same sin? Regarding tolerance, they (non-Muslims) read in the newspapers that in school books in Saudi Arabia the Jews or Christians and considered pigs. They learn that the day Iran won a qualifying match for the World Cup women danced in the streets and \"dared to uncover their heads,\" or that there is a fatwa against a writer for writing something that here is completely harmless. They see in some countries that Christian buildings are forbidden and Western women are obliged to wear a veil. My countrymen read these stories and think it represents the whole of Islamic society. This is very unfortunate, because these stories do not represent all of Islamic society.\n++++++\nAmira Ru\u00edz, 24, student in international business from Barcelona who converted from Catholicism to Islam a year ago.\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (61 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nIn Spain we are never taught about Islam, so the clich\u00e9s build and build. We hear that Islam is bad, that it's intolerant and represses women. People here don't really know what Islam is. There is a huge difference between Islam and the Islamic traditions of tyrannical governments in Islamic countries. But Spaniards don't distinguish between the two. Also Islam doesn't say women can't work. It just says that family and children should be a woman's main responsibility. If she can take care of her family and work too, there is no problem.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Spain (81 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nThere are two main reasons for this. The tyrannical governments in the Muslim world are a big reason. Those who rise to power stay there, and they accumulate the wealth for themselves. So the wealth goes to a very few. The problem of tyrannical governments is something the Muslims have to solve for themselves. The West has also exploited these countries. These countries are often rich in natural resources, in diamonds, in oil. But the profits go to the West.\n3) A majority of Muslims in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (50 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of non-Muslims in your country (70 percent) do not view Muslims as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nWesterners can seem very individualist to Muslims. Spain is actually one of the countries where family and friends matter most compared to other places in Europe. But the idea is still that you have to succeed on your own. Muslims are always looking out for others. They are always offering you something. They offer you food even if they're hungry, they offer you their bed even if they have only one. The idea is that what you give to others you get back in return many times over. Regarding the view that Muslims are not tolerant, I think again they are confusing Islam with the policies of the tyrannical Arab governments. When I converted to Islam, people said, \"How can you choose a religion that obligates you to wear a veil and let's men beat their wives?\" But these are government policies, not Islam. Veils are required by governments, but Islam doesn't say I have to wear a veil if I don't want to. If I wear a veil or cover my skin, it's because I don't want to be looked at as a sexual object. I want to be looked at by a man because I am speaking to him, not because I am a sexual object with an open shirt and short pants that are going to get his attention.\n++++++\nAhmed el Abdellaoui, 40, a translator who lives in Madrid but is originally from Morocco.\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (61 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nIslam is so close to Christianity as a religion that from the beginning the church has been worried that it could draw away some of its faithful. So the church campaigned against Islam because it presented a threat to the church. And they still haven't done much to reverse that. Because of this, people in the West do not understand Islam. People in the West grab the little parts that do not fit with their view of the world, and they focus on them as proof that Islam and the West don't go together.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Spain (81 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nEssentially these are internal problems. The Muslim world hasn't been able to organize its societies in a modern way. Our governments lack a clear separation of powers in the modern sense, for example. Assistance from the West would be more effective if it did not come with so many strings attached. They often ask us to change our culture to get more assistance. They want us to adopt democracy, to give religion less prominence. But Muslim countries are not willing to give up their culture.\n3) A majority of Muslims in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (50 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of non-Muslims in your country (70 percent) do not view Muslims as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nIt depends what you mean by tolerant. If it means you have to give up your ways and take up the ways of the West, Muslims don't want to do that. Spaniards also say that the Chinese are not tolerant. They say that immigrants from Latin America are tolerant because they have the same religion, the same language, similar cultures. But the Chinese and the Muslims are considered not tolerant because we are from different cultures. They don't understand us, so they say that we have no interest in knowing Spain, that we are intolerant of the way things are in Spain. Regarding the view that the West is selfish, the reason for that is probably that the concept of individualism doesn't exit in Muslim countries. If you are alone in the Muslim world, you are nothing; family ties are sacred. In Spain, it is much more every man for himself.\n++++++\nManuela Aparicio, 58, a publishing executive in Madrid\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (61 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nI think first we have to look at ourselves. It's as if people were ashamed of our roots. Some people in Spain want to forget that we were a Muslim country for nearly 800 years. But you cannot deny your roots, and we all have Islamic roots.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Spain (81 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nThe political leaders take the money and keep it. That keeps the West from sending more aid than it does, and makes economic growth difficult.\n3) A majority of Muslims in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (50 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of non-Muslims in your country (70 percent) do not view Muslims as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nRegarding the view that the West is selfish, that could be just an expression of the fact that they don't feel welcome here, so they think we only care about ourselves. Regarding tolerance, well that's the way a lot of people see their religion. They may just be practicing their religion, and to Westerners that seems intolerant. Just because they don't accept our religion, it doesn't mean they are intolerant. They have also faced rejection here, so they may be bitter towards the West.\n+++++\nZaida D\u00edaz, 33, an accountant from Madrid.\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (61 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nI don't think anyone is it to blame. I think it's that the peoples don't understand each other. Spain has good relations with a lot of the governments in the Muslim world, but the peoples don't always seem to trust each other. It could be that they have trouble getting past the stereotypes.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Spain (81 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nThe West could help more, but the problems I think are mostly internal. Their religion is antiquated, and the governments are often corrupt. The societies are still in the Middle Ages, and that holds back their economies.\n3) A majority of Muslims in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (50 percent). How do you explain this? A majority of non-Muslims in your country (70 percent) do not view Muslims as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nI'd say this shows that the two groups don't interact. The Muslim community here is very isolated, so they don't understand the rest of Spain, and Spaniards don't understand them. Perceptions are based mostly on stereotypes.\nTURKEY\nFrom Sebnem Arsu\n++++++\nVolkan Aytar, 35, program officer, Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation, Istanbul. The foundation is a think-tank group that conducts extensive social and economic studies in Turkey, especially in relation with the EU.\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (64 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nI think both sides have some share of the blame in this particular perception problem, but perhaps the West has the largest part, in the sense that historically there has been a Western attitude of Orientalism whereby the West chose to speak for the Orient and made assumptions about the Orient that are not always correct. The Western rhetoric that defined the Orient as backward, traditionalist and more emotionally driven for many years has excluded the Muslim East as a political subject that has its own political will.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Turkey (90 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nI think it's more because of Western colonialism and global inequality in the economic world. Because of the colonial heritage, the East did not develop its own economic infrastructure, and if there was an economic infrastructure to talk about, like in Gulf countries such as the Emirates or Saudi Arabia, they were authoritarian countries that the West chose to support because they were sympathetic to the U.S. and Western interests. Those, on the other hand, who were more critical to the West, couldn't build any kind of infrastructure and remained weak. And after the trend of globalization in 1990s, the distribution of economic wealth has been very unequal on the global scale.\n3) A majority of people in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (69 percent) and greedy (67 percent). How do you explain this? Only 27 percent view Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nI think it has to do with the more nonmaterialistic approach in Muslim countries like Turkey - if there is such a thing. The Western lifestyle is based on materialist things, versus the community-oriented life in the East. Muslim Eastern countries consider materialism as a bad thing, but for a better future they have to respect individualism more. So, there is confusion there. In their eyes, individualism is not good in itself, but not all communitarian values are good either. Communitarian lifestyles are oppressive on people. They see Western individualism as just being greedy, which is not the case. The Eastern people have to be more critical of themselves. This can also be partly a way of expressing jealousy for the economic welfare in the West. Westerners may be labeled as greedy and selfish because they are richer. In other words, there is a lack of understanding when it comes to the qualities that make the Western world. The understanding of the West as selfish and greedy may have roots even in Western morals, which are very relaxed, therefore not good in many Eastern people's eyes. Men and women are just too close to each other.\n++++++\nMustafa Karaduman, 51, owner of Tekbir, a Turkish fashion brand that manufactures clothing for devout Muslim women, Istanbul. He is the founder of this alternative female Islamic clothing line and has 22 stores around Turkey.\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (64 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nBoth sides are responsible. Muslims trust the West more than necessary, and see the West as their savior. While bossing about human rights, the West did absolutely nothing to protect the Bosnians while Serbs massacred them in the heart of Europe. Bosnians were not considered as Europeans because they were Muslims. There have been many more situations like that in the world. In Turkey, on the other hand, when the criminal law was reformed in alignment with the standards in the European Union member states, many people - including Kurdish politicians who were jailed in violation of the freedom of speech - were freed. The Muslims, on the other hand, who hoped to receive the European support for a better status of religious schools in Turkey or for lifting the ban on head scarves in schools, were very much disappointed by the dismissive attitude of the European Human Rights Court. The court dropped the charges against the Turkish state and betrayed the support of millions in Turkey. Muslims in Turkey are also responsible because they didn't question the ruling Justice and Development Party government for not keeping their promises as they vowed to solve the head scarf problem before elections. People here trusted the EU more than necessary, but the results are satisfying in the sense that they finally recognized the EU's double standards.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Turkey (90 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nIran has the richest natural gas reserves after Russia and is improving its nuclear technology; Malaysia is strong in the automotive sector; Indonesia builds the best planes; no need to mention the petrol reserves in the Arabic world; and last but not the least, Turkey has the largest mine reserves in the world for Bor and Torium minerals, next-generation alternative energy resources. If these states can eliminate U.S. oppression on the petrol-rich countries and unite Muslim countries, there is a huge market potential. Their weakness comes from the lack of interaction between them. We're talking about a 1.5 billion population, which can be the leading power in the world only if they realize that they do not need the U.S. or any other organization but togetherness to grow richer. Turkey should opt to become their unifying leader.\n3) A majority of people in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (69 percent) and greedy (67 percent). How do you explain this? Only 27 percent view Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nI think 27 percent of the people who voted for Western tolerance have not yet realized that the concept of tolerance does not exist in the West, which they identify as the EU. These people grow with a blind dedication to the EU, and are taught to trust the EU without questioning it, at all costs. Media plays a big role in painting a wrong picture about the EU, and they believe in whatever appears in the mainstream papers. If the Westerners had been tolerant, the EU would have recognized the Turkish part of Cyprus, instead of the Greek Cypriot government, which slaughtered the Turks on the island before the Turkish Army interfered in 1974. The survey sounds right in terms of greediness and selfishness in the West. They do not recognize anything than their own interests. What they wish for themselves does not apply to Muslims. Westerners' approach in social rights and human rights is perfect, but when those have to apply to Muslims, they have double standards. I tried almost every country to get a student visa for my son, who now does his PhD in the U.K. I submitted every possible document to prove that he had no other intention. The U.S. rejected him; so did other countries, without any excuse. These figures in the survey would have been different if they respected us the same way they expect to be respected. Westerners are greedy, that's also true. As part of the reform laws, the EU asks every possible sacrifice from Turkey but gives very little, if not nothing, in return. Well, what to expect, if our prime minister openly says, \"We're not becoming a member to be a burden, but to lift the burdens\" - and this is just unacceptable.\n++++++\nProfessor Nilufer Narli, sociologist, vice president of Bahcesehir University in Istanbul\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (64 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nThere is no party to be blamed, but I think there are misperceptions or distortions, and lack of dialogue between two communities. The image of the Muslim has been distorted in the West after the Sept. 11 attacks, and with the rise of global terrorist networks like Al Qaeda, in many people's eyes a Muslim has become someone extremely religious, fanatical, ready to take violent action in the name of religion, so also dubious. But I should also say that there is a similar misperception of the West in the Muslim world. Their image is also distorted, and very often Muslims think that the West doesn't care for Muslim people, the West is biased against Muslim people or doesn't want to share its wealth and know-how with the Muslim East.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Turkey (90 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nThe first problem is underdevelopment. When I look at many other Muslim countries, there are very low figures pointing out poverty, illiteracy levels - especially among women except in places like Malaysia - in the Arab world. The level of socio-economic and human development is much lower when it comes to Muslim countries. And in the human development comparison between man and woman, there is also a large gender gap. Another reason why Muslim countries are not doing as well as their Western counterparts is that in many Muslim countries the social and political relations evolve around family and kinship, which makes it difficult to develop trust and cooperate with other global and domestic businesses. Because the level of trust and the level of social capital are low, it prevents proper, stable production and professional business. They tend to form business relations with family companies, and this creates problems of institutionalizing and transparency. Such companies cannot expand and form international global and business connections.\n3) A majority of people in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (69 percent) and greedy (67 percent). How do you explain this? Only 27 percent view Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nIn Turkey, the distorted picture of the West has roots in the former confrontation between Ottoman Empire and West European countries and the bitter memories of the Independence War. Based on these memories, according to many Turks, West Europeans have only one interest, which is to divide Turkey like they tried to do during the Independence War, and therefore they are seen as a threat. The West, in their eyes, is selfish and not trustworthy. But on the other hand, 70 percent in Turkey still want to be a part of the European Union. As for tolerance, it is an ambiguous question. We do not know the issues that tolerance was rated on. If they mean gender issues, I think the results can be explained using a sociology term, \"the mirror image.\" There are many studies that show the level of tolerance in Turkey on many issues as very low. When it comes to single women living alone, or flirtation between the sexes, the tolerance is low. So, the public projects its own low level of tolerance on other societies, and creates a \"mirror image.\" Another reason can be the ongoing xenophobia in Turkey, which is again still strong combined with Independence War memories that lead to the distorted image of Westerners in Turkey.\n++++++\nHasan Karaer, 42, head waiter at the Kardesler Restaurant in Istanbul\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (64 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nWesterners do not like us and we do not like them, either. We cannot catch up with their lifestyle because our moral values are different. We belong to different worlds, different traditions. We have all seen what they have done in Iraq; they simply do not have conscience. I do not favor the EU, also. They will never accept us inside because we're Muslims. Only if we, Muslims, got together we would make up a much stronger group than the EU. Otherwise, this EU is only a big game. God knows whether the grandchild of a grandchild would ever be able to see Turkey as a member there.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Turkey (90 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nThere are rich nations but very poor, also. I don't think wealth is important. The important thing is your inner beauty, the richness in your soul. Who has so far succeeded to take along their riches to the other world? \"The kefen\" - the cloth in which Muslims wrap the dead for a funeral - \"does not have a pocket,\" we say, and should live accordingly. We should think about the other world and stop being greedy.\n3) A majority of people in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (69 percent) and greedy (67 percent). How do you explain this? Only 27 percent view Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nI do not know many Westerners to say more about this. But if we look at the EU, and their way of treating us, asking for more and more, they are very good in selfishness and greediness; there is no sincerity. If there is one thing they're good at, it's playing games.\n++++++\nOzlem Ozer, 30, assistant architect, Istanbul\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (64 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nI don't think these results are genuine. It's the media and the government links behind almost every matter that determines people's way of thinking in Turkey - as well as in many parts of the world. Media cannot inform the public free of the interests of the political parties. When you go to a remote town in Anatolia, where there is less media bombardment, you would see people feeling friendlier toward the West. But the more media gets involved in people's lives and distorts the realities, the results of such surveys feel less reliable.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Turkey (90 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nNeither the West nor the Muslims are to blame for the lack of wealth in these Muslim countries. Responsibility rests only with the major economic powers, which do not have religion or nationality. There are many inequalities in the world. Especially, the Gulf countries are very rich in natural resources, and the Middle East region could have done much better, but we have to check how large is the profit share of the power groups over there. There is the answer.\n3) A majority of people in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (69 percent) and greedy (67 percent). How do you explain this? Only 27 percent view Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nIt is enough to look at the economic imbalances to see why people think badly about Westerners. The United States, France, England, Germany and many other countries have become what they are by exploiting either the natural resources or manpower of other countries. Therefore Westerners, in this ongoing system based on exploitation, will always remain selfish and greedy. Because they have been always ahead of us, and succeeded in all this wealth through exploitation, they had the chance to grant more rights and better lives to their own people. When one looks from outside and sees all the benefits that the Westerners give to their people, they may at first think that Westerners are tolerant. But in a closer analysis, it's not hard to see that they mostly look out for their own race while distributing their wealth and understanding. Migrant workers in many Western countries are treated badly and suffer injustice, although they are the ones that keep those countries on their strong feet. Colonialism might have ended in one form but continues in another in the West.\n++++++\nMustafa Umranyildizli, 39, taxi driver, Istanbul\n1) In a recent global opinion survey, a majority of people questioned in your country (64 percent) said they felt relations between Muslims and Westerners around the world were generally bad. Who do you think is to blame for this, Muslims or people in Western countries? Why?\nBecause Muslims are generally not honest. It is hard to find someone to trust in Muslim communities.\n2) A large majority of people in 10 countries around the world, including Turkey (90 percent), think Muslim nations should be more economically prosperous than they are today. What do you believe is responsible for Muslim nations' lack of prosperity? Please explain.\nOf course they will be poor. How many of them are educated people? What are they actually producing? Most of the people here try to live beyond their means, in debt most of the time. In Saudi Arabia and Gulf countries they wouldn't have been so rich if they hadn't had any petrol resources. Name me a single Muslim country that has become rich by hard working. You cannot.\n3) A majority of people in your country say they see people in Western countries as selfish (69 percent) and greedy (67 percent). How do you explain this? Only 27 percent view Westerners as tolerant. How do you explain this?\nI don't know enough Westerners to judge why. Muslims, however, do not want to become like Westerners. The West in my eyes represents a civilized life. A hard-liner Muslim does not want to become civilized, or live like a Westerner, so instead prefers to blame Westerners for being greedy and selfish in order to stay away from them.",

    "text": "A Younger India Is Flexing Its Industrial Brawn\n2006-09-01T04:00:00.000Z\nPUNE, India \u2014 India\u2019s economic advancement no longer rests on telephone call centers and computer programmers.\nAmong villages with thatch-roofed huts and dirt roads on the outskirts of this city in central India, John Deere and LG Electronics have recently built factories turning out tractors and color television sets for sale in India and for export to the United States.\nIn Hazira, in northwestern India, where some residents still rely on camels to carry traders\u2019 goods, the Essar Group is making steel to be used for ventilation shafts in Philadelphia, high-rise structural beams in Chicago and car engine mountings in Detroit.\nFor decades, India followed a route to economic development strikingly different from that of countries like Japan, South Korea or China. While its Asian rivals placed their bets on manufacturing and exports, India focused on its domestic economy and grew more slowly with an emphasis on services.\nBut all that is starting to change.\nIndia\u2019s annual growth in manufacturing output, at 9 percent and accelerating, is close to catching growth in services, at 10 percent. Exports of manufactured goods to the United States are now rising faster in percentage terms than China\u2019s, although from a much smaller base. More than two-thirds of foreign investment in the last year has gone into manufacturing in India, not services.\n\u201cSaying we are a back office and China is a factory is a backhanded compliment,\u201d said Kamal Nath, India\u2019s minister of commerce and industry. \u201cIt\u2019s not really correct.\u201d\nIndeed, in interviews at 18 Indian factories and other businesses in 10 cities and villages scattered across the length and breadth of the nation, the picture that emerges is of a country being driven by advances in manufacturing to a much brisker pace of economic growth.\nA prime reason India is now developing into the world\u2019s next big industrial power is that a number of global manufacturers are already looking ahead to a serious demographic squeeze facing China. Because of China\u2019s \u201cone child\u201d policy, family sizes have been shrinking there since the 1980\u2019s, so fewer young people will be available soon for factory labor.\nIndia is not expected to pass China in total population until 2030. But India will have more young workers aged 20 to 24 by 2013; the International Labor Organization predicts that by 2020, India will have 116 million workers in this age bracket to China\u2019s 94 million.\nIndia\u2019s young population will also make it a huge and growing market for years to come, while the engineering skills and English skills of its educated elite will make it competitive across a wide range of industries. So even though India remains a difficult place to do business, several multinationals have been placing big bets on India in hopes of taking advantage of this shifting global dynamic.\nGeneral Motors and Motorola are preparing to build plants in western and southern India. Posco of South Korea and Mittal Steel of the Netherlands have each announced plans to erect giant steel mills in eastern India, where Reliance of India will soon construct one of the world\u2019s largest coal-fired power plants.\nThey are finding India\u2019s labor force well suited to their goals. When LG set out in 2005 to fill 458 assembly line jobs at its factory here at a starting wage of $90 a month, it required that each applicant have at least 15 years of education \u2014 usually high school plus technical college.\nSeeking a young work force, the company decided that no more than 1 percent of the workers could have had any prior work experience. Despite the limitation, 55,000 young people met its criteria for interviews.\n\u201cIn the villages there is little income,\u201d said Siddu Matheapattu, 24, in between applying sealant to refrigerator frames. \u201cHere I can earn more.\u201d\nBy contrast, cities in the export-oriented Guangdong Province in southeastern China raised monthly minimum wages this summer by 18 percent, to $70 to $100 a month, after factories reported that they had one million more jobs than workers to fill them. Factories elsewhere in China face less severe labor shortages, but they also are being forced to raise wages.\nAs India has deregulated its economy, output has gradually accelerated to a growth rate of 8 percent a year, feeding a national euphoria and a few hopes of someday even beating China\u2019s annual growth of more than 10 percent.\nPlenty of obstacles remain, however, notably India\u2019s weak infrastructure. China invests $7 on roads, ports, electricity and other backbones of a modern economy for every dollar spent by India \u2014 and it shows. Ports here are struggling to handle rising exports, blackouts are frequent and dirt roads are common even in Bangalore, the center of the country\u2019s sophisticated computer programming industry.\nPervasive corruption has slowed many efforts to fix these problems. India\u2019s labor laws, little changed since they were enacted just after independence in 1947, also continue to discourage companies from hiring workers, by making it very difficult to lay off employees even if a company\u2019s fortunes sour or the economy slows.\nStill, a new optimism prevails in India, bordering at times on euphoria.\n\u201cThe Chinese are very good at copying things, but Indians believe in quality work, we believe in meeting pollution norms,\u201d said S. S. Pathania, the assistant general manager of the Hero Honda motorcycle factory in Gurgaon, 30 miles south of New Delhi. \u201cI think India will pass China very soon.\u201d\nAn Unexpected Boom In Manufacturing\nSprawling across more than a square mile next to a gray tidal estuary, the scale of the Essar Group\u2019s complex in Hazira is already impressive. Essar has its own port to bring in iron ore and its own large gas-fired power plant for electricity. At the steel mill, giant buckets pour 150 tons of molten metal at a time to form slabs 2 yards wide and up to 10 yards long.\nBut the complex is just starting to grow. Essar is quintupling steel production and pushing forward a sevenfold increase in power generation, most of it for sale to a national grid desperately short of electricity.\nGrowth on that scale, especially in industries like steel and power but also in areas like car parts and household appliances, is what India has long lacked. Industrial production accounts for only a fifth of India\u2019s economic output, compared with two-fifths of China\u2019s. But this ratio is starting to rise in India as manufacturing, led by exports, grows faster than agriculture and even some service industries.\nUntil recently, legislation effectively barred companies with more than 100 employees from competing in many industries. The laws were intended to protect tiny businesses in villages, often employing women and minorities; high tariffs were placed on imports as well.\nBut a result was hundreds of thousands of businesses too small to be competitive; India lags behind even the impoverished Bangladesh next door in exports of garments, a big creator of jobs for China. The Indian government has responded by narrowing the list of protected industries to 326 categories of goods from 20,000 and has lowered tariffs.\nComparing factories in India to their competitors in China, many of the Indian factories are smaller but some appear more efficient. \nIndia\u2019s stronger financial system demands higher interest rates than China\u2019s state-owned banks, making it costlier to hold the small mountains of components awaiting assembly that are often seen in Chinese factories. The Confederation of Indian Industry, a national trade group, has also been highly successful in pushing companies to adopt the latest Japanese lean manufacturing techniques.\nThe drawback is that the nation\u2019s manufacturing boom, built on higher-quality goods made under more modern conditions than in China, is not likely to create as many factory jobs as India needs. \nThe Essar steel mill, for example, has been replacing old, labor-intensive equipment with more modern gear. \u201cWe were having it all done manually, but because the customers demand very high quality, we have to do it automatically,\u201d yelled Rajesh Pandita, an Essar manager, over the roar of a house-size machine that was stretching a minivan-size coil of steel back and forth through large rollers until it was little thicker than plastic kitchen wrap.\nThe Whirlpool factory in Pune uses machines, not people, to fold the steel exteriors of refrigerators. It has some of the highest productivity per worker of any Whirlpool factory in the world, with just 208 line workers producing up to 33,000 refrigerators a month.\nLabor laws, however, discourage flexibility. They still ban companies from allowing manufacturing workers to put in more than 54 hours of overtime in a three-month period even if the workers want to earn extra money. Firing workers is extremely difficult.\n\u201cCompanies think twice, 10 times before they hire new people,\u201d said Sunil Kant Munjal, the chairman of the Hero Group, one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of inexpensive motorcycles.\nHero in Gurgaon, on the southern outskirts of New Delhi, and its archrival, the Lifan Group in Chongqing, a city in western China, produce comparable motorcycles but the similarity ends there. Hero markets heavily to its domestic market, protected from foreign competition by high import tariffs, while Lifan emphasizes exports.\nWith scant ventilation, Lifan\u2019s factories are filled with diesel exhaust as workers test engines and ride finished bikes at breakneck speed out the doors, zigzagging past co-workers. Hero\u2019s factory in Gurgaon, where Honda holds a minority stake, has far better safety standards and excellent ventilation.\nThe Lifan factory pays less than $100 a month. The heavily unionized Hero factory pays $150 a month plus bonuses of up to $370 a month; nearly half the workers earn the top bonus, Mr. Pathania said.\nLifan\u2019s labor force is quiescent \u2014 would-be organizers of independent labor unions face long jail terms or worse in China. Hero\u2019s workers staged a successful nonviolent protest in 2005 to call for more contract workers to be eligible for the bonuses as well.\nBad Roads and Blackouts Take a Toll on Efficiency \nBut the biggest question mark hanging over the rise of manufacturing in India lies in whether the country has enough roads, ports and electricity-generating plants to move huge quantities of goods and power the factories that make them.\nCaptain Abhay Srivastava, an operations manager at India\u2019s busiest port, was on duty on a recent afternoon when a phone call suddenly came in from the docks below. An enormous container ship from Qatar needed to slide 35 feet backward along the privately managed dock at the Nhava Sheva port near Mumbai to allow another large vessel to squeeze into the dock in front of it.\nCaptain Srivastava grabbed his white hard hat and dashed for the elevator. As soon as he reached the water\u2019s edge, a dozen laborers in orange jumpsuits began straining to arrange a cat\u2019s cradle of heavy, five-inch-thick ropes that would allow the ship to use its powerful winches to pull itself out of the way.\n\u201cThey are efficient people; they don\u2019t speak a lot,\u201d said Captain Srivastava, who has visited most of the world\u2019s major ports either as a ship captain or for port training exercises. \u201cYou go to some places and they just stand around.\u201d\nThe efficiency of the Nhava Sheva port \u2014 it approaches West Coast ports in the United States in the number of containers moved per hour \u2014 shows that India is capable of producing world-class facilities.\nBut big as it is, Nhava Sheva is too small to handle the crush of traffic. John Deere tractors wait in a container at the dock for one to four days before being loaded on a ship.\n\u201cIf this pace of growth continues, we will see more congestion at the port,\u201d said Raj Kalathur, the managing director and chief executive of Deere\u2019s operations in India.\nSimilar worries prevail in Chennai, formerly Madras. \u201cAnother four or five years, we\u2019ll be choked,\u201d said M. Rafeeque Ahmed, the chairman of the Farida Group, a 9,000-employee shoe manufacturer in Chennai that needs the port for exports.\nInfrastructure improvements are particularly important because manufacturing companies are buying more and more components from far-flung suppliers. Making sure all those parts arrive on time requires a reliable transportation system.\n\u201cManufacturing is no longer done all under one roof,\u201d said Victor Fung, the chairman of the Li & Fung Group, a large Hong Kong-based company that buys goods from factories across Asia for sale to retailers and wholesalers in the United States and Europe. \nIndian officials are talking about expansion. Planning is under way for new wharves at Nhava Sheva, but the years-long task of construction has not yet started.\nChina has faced capacity problems, too. A surge in steel production in early 2004 overwhelmed bulk cargo ports. Inflation quintupled in a year, to 5.3 percent, as bottlenecks at ports, highways, railroads and elsewhere in China drove up companies\u2019 costs.\nThe Chinese response was swift and decisive. The pace of port investment nearly tripled in six months. Work crews labored around the clock to erect more cranes and expand wharves.\nThe Chinese economy grew at a breathtaking pace of 11.3 percent in the second quarter of 2006, but consumer prices were just 1 percent higher in July than a year earlier.\nBy contrast, India is struggling with 8 percent inflation this summer as bottlenecks have appeared after three years of 8 percent growth.\nBelatedly, India\u2019s roads and ports are improving. Just four years ago, Sona Koyo Steering Systems, an auto parts manufacturer, incurred hefty financing costs to keep a month\u2019s inventory on hand in case deliveries were delayed. Now its factory in Gurgaon makes six deliveries a day to a nearby Maruti car assembly plant; the eight-mile drive takes an hour or more because of traffic jams, but the deliveries get through.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to deny infrastructure is bad,\u201d said Surinder Kapur, Sona\u2019s chairman and managing director. \u201cBut a lot of our vendors are around us, a lot of our customers are close to us.\u201d\nIndia is also starting to address chronic power shortages. But it is still a serious problem in northern India, where Mr. Kapur has his steering systems factory. He receives electricity from the national grid just seven or eight hours a day. So the factory has three enormous diesel generators, one bigger than a typical Manhattan living room, operating at four times what an industrial user in the United States usually pays.\nDespite such obstacles, India\u2019s manufacturing sector appears poised for further growth. In a country where the national symbol has shifted from government bureaucrats at aging desks to call center operators in cubicles, it looks as if the next icon will be the laptop-toting engineer on a factory floor.\n\u201cThe old philosophy was, \u2018I should work in an office, come in at 10 and leave at 4,\u2019 \u201d said Nitin Kulkarni, 35, an engineer at the Hazira steel mill. But in recent years, he added, \u201cthere has been a revolution.\u201d",

    "text": "What Should a Billionaire Give \u0096 and What Should You?\n2006-12-17T05:00:00.000Z\nWhat is a human life worth? You may not want to put a price tag on a it. But if we really had to, most of us would agree that the value of a human life would be in the millions. Consistent with the foundations of our democracy and our frequently professed belief in the inherent dignity of human beings, we would also agree that all humans are created equal, at least to the extent of denying that differences of sex, ethnicity, nationality and place of residence change the value of a human life.\nWith Christmas approaching, and Americans writing checks to their favorite charities, it's a good time to ask how these two beliefs -- that a human life, if it can be priced at all, is worth millions, and that the factors I have mentioned do not alter the value of a human life -- square with our actions. Perhaps this year such questions lurk beneath the surface of more family discussions than usual, for it has been an extraordinary year for philanthropy, especially philanthropy to fight global poverty.\nFor Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, the ideal of valuing all human life equally began to jar against reality some years ago, when he read an article about diseases in the developing world and came across the statistic that half a million children die every year from rotavirus, the most common cause of severe diarrhea in children. He had never heard of rotavirus. \"How could I never have heard of something that kills half a million children every year?\" he asked himself. He then learned that in developing countries, millions of children die from diseases that have been eliminated, or virtually eliminated, in the United States. That shocked him because he assumed that, if there are vaccines and treatments that could save lives, governments would be doing everything possible to get them to the people who need them. As Gates told a meeting of the World Health Assembly in Geneva last year, he and his wife, Melinda, \"couldn't escape the brutal conclusion that -- in our world today -- some lives are seen as worth saving and others are not.\" They said to themselves, \"This can't be true.\" But they knew it was.\nGates's speech to the World Health Assembly concluded on an optimistic note, looking forward to the next decade when \"people will finally accept that the death of a child in the developing world is just as tragic as the death of a child in the developed world.\" That belief in the equal value of all human life is also prominent on the Web site of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, where under Our Values we read: \"All lives -- no matter where they are being led -- have equal value.\"\nWe are very far from acting in accordance with that belief. In the same world in which more than a billion people live at a level of affluence never previously known, roughly a billion other people struggle to survive on the purchasing power equivalent of less than one U.S. dollar per day. Most of the world's poorest people are undernourished, lack access to safe drinking water or even the most basic health services and cannot send their children to school. According to Unicef, more than 10 million children die every year -- about 30,000 per day -- from avoidable, poverty-related causes.\nLast June the investor Warren Buffett took a significant step toward reducing those deaths when he pledged $31 billion to the Gates Foundation, and another $6 billion to other charitable foundations. Buffett's pledge, set alongside the nearly $30 billion given by Bill and Melinda Gates to their foundation, has made it clear that the first decade of the 21st century is a new \"golden age of philanthropy.\" On an inflation-adjusted basis, Buffett has pledged to give more than double the lifetime total given away by two of the philanthropic giants of the past, Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, put together. Bill and Melinda Gates's gifts are not far behind.\nGates's and Buffett's donations will now be put to work primarily to reduce poverty, disease and premature death in the developing world. According to the Global Forum for Health Research, less than 10 percent of the world's health research budget is spent on combating conditions that account for 90 percent of the global burden of disease. In the past, diseases that affect only the poor have been of no commercial interest to pharmaceutical manufacturers, because the poor cannot afford to buy their products. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), heavily supported by the Gates Foundation, seeks to change this by guaranteeing to purchase millions of doses of vaccines, when they are developed, that can prevent diseases like malaria. GAVI has also assisted developing countries to immunize more people with existing vaccines: 99 million additional children have been reached to date. By doing this, GAVI claims to have already averted nearly 1.7 million future deaths.\nPhilanthropy on this scale raises many ethical questions: Why are the people who are giving doing so? Does it do any good? Should we praise them for giving so much or criticize them for not giving still more? Is it troubling that such momentous decisions are made by a few extremely wealthy individuals? And how do our judgments about them reflect on our own way of living?\nLet's start with the question of motives. The rich must -- or so some of us with less money like to assume -- suffer sleepless nights because of their ruthlessness in squeezing out competitors, firing workers, shutting down plants or whatever else they have to do to acquire their wealth. When wealthy people give away money, we can always say that they are doing it to ease their consciences or generate favorable publicity. It has been suggested -- by, for example, David Kirkpatrick, a senior editor at Fortune magazine -- that Bill Gates's turn to philanthropy was linked to the antitrust problems Microsoft had in the U.S. and the European Union. Was Gates, consciously or subconsciously, trying to improve his own image and that of his company?\nThis kind of sniping tells us more about the attackers than the attacked. Giving away large sums, rather than spending the money on corporate advertising or developing new products, is not a sensible strategy for increasing personal wealth. When we read that someone has given away a lot of their money, or time, to help others, it challenges us to think about our own behavior. Should we be following their example, in our own modest way? But if the rich just give their money away to improve their image, or to make up for past misdeeds -- misdeeds quite unlike any we have committed, of course -- then, conveniently, what they are doing has no relevance to what we ought to do.\nA famous story is told about Thomas Hobbes, the 17th-century English philosopher, who argued that we all act in our own interests. On seeing him give alms to a beggar, a cleric asked Hobbes if he would have done this if Christ had not commanded us to do so. Yes, Hobbes replied, he was in pain to see the miserable condition of the old man, and his gift, by providing the man with some relief from that misery, also eased Hobbes's pain. That reply reconciles Hobbes's charity with his egoistic theory of human motivation, but at the cost of emptying egoism of much of its bite. If egoists suffer when they see a stranger in distress, they are capable of being as charitable as any altruist.\nFollowers of the 18th-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant would disagree. They think an act has moral worth only if it is done out of a sense of duty. Doing something merely because you enjoy doing it, or enjoy seeing its consequences, they say, has no moral worth, because if you happened not to enjoy doing it, then you wouldn't do it, and you are not responsible for your likes and dislikes, whereas you are responsible for your obedience to the demands of duty.\nPerhaps some philanthropists are motivated by their sense of duty. Apart from the equal value of all human life, the other \"simple value\" that lies at the core of the work of the Gates Foundation, according to its Web site, is \"To whom much has been given, much is expected.\" That suggests the view that those who have great wealth have a duty to use it for a larger purpose than their own interests. But while such questions of motive may be relevant to our assessment of Gates's or Buffett's character, they pale into insignificance when we consider the effect of what Gates and Buffett are doing. The parents whose children could die from rotavirus care more about getting the help that will save their children's lives than about the motivations of those who make that possible.\nInterestingly, neither Gates nor Buffett seems motivated by the possibility of being rewarded in heaven for his good deeds on earth. Gates told a Time interviewer, \"There's a lot more I could be doing on a Sunday morning\" than going to church. Put them together with Andrew Carnegie, famous for his freethinking, and three of the four greatest American philanthropists have been atheists or agnostics. (The exception is John D. Rockefeller.) In a country in which 96 percent of the population say they believe in a supreme being, that's a striking fact. It means that in one sense, Gates and Buffett are probably less self-interested in their charity than someone like Mother Teresa, who as a pious Roman Catholic believed in reward and punishment in the afterlife.\nMore important than questions about motives are questions about whether there is an obligation for the rich to give, and if so, how much they should give. A few years ago, an African-American cabdriver taking me to the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington asked me if I worked at the bank. I told him I did not but was speaking at a conference on development and aid. He then assumed that I was an economist, but when I said no, my training was in philosophy, he asked me if I thought the U.S. should give foreign aid. When I answered affirmatively, he replied that the government shouldn't tax people in order to give their money to others. That, he thought, was robbery. When I asked if he believed that the rich should voluntarily donate some of what they earn to the poor, he said that if someone had worked for his money, he wasn't going to tell him what to do with it.\nAt that point we reached our destination. Had the journey continued, I might have tried to persuade him that people can earn large amounts only when they live under favorable social circumstances, and that they don't create those circumstances by themselves. I could have quoted Warren Buffett's acknowledgment that society is responsible for much of his wealth. \"If you stick me down in the middle of Bangladesh or Peru,\" he said, \"you'll find out how much this talent is going to produce in the wrong kind of soil.\" The Nobel Prize-winning economist and social scientist Herbert Simon estimated that \"social capital\" is responsible for at least 90 percent of what people earn in wealthy societies like those of the United States or northwestern Europe. By social capital Simon meant not only natural resources but, more important, the technology and organizational skills in the community, and the presence of good government. These are the foundation on which the rich can begin their work. \"On moral grounds,\" Simon added, \"we could argue for a flat income tax of 90 percent.\" Simon was not, of course, advocating so steep a rate of tax, for he was well aware of disincentive effects. But his estimate does undermine the argument that the rich are entitled to keep their wealth because it is all a result of their hard work. If Simon is right, that is true of at most 10 percent of it.\nIn any case, even if we were to grant that people deserve every dollar they earn, that doesn't answer the question of what they should do with it. We might say that they have a right to spend it on lavish parties, private jets and luxury yachts, or, for that matter, to flush it down the toilet. But we could still think that for them to do these things while others die from easily preventable diseases is wrong. In an article I wrote more than three decades ago, at the time of a humanitarian emergency in what is now Bangladesh, I used the example of walking by a shallow pond and seeing a small child who has fallen in and appears to be in danger of drowning. Even though we did nothing to cause the child to fall into the pond, almost everyone agrees that if we can save the child at minimal inconvenience or trouble to ourselves, we ought to do so. Anything else would be callous, indecent and, in a word, wrong. The fact that in rescuing the child we may, for example, ruin a new pair of shoes is not a good reason for allowing the child to drown. Similarly if for the cost of a pair of shoes we can contribute to a health program in a developing country that stands a good chance of saving the life of a child, we ought to do so.\nPerhaps, though, our obligation to help the poor is even stronger than this example implies, for we are less innocent than the passer-by who did nothing to cause the child to fall into the pond. Thomas Pogge, a philosopher at Columbia University, has argued that at least some of our affluence comes at the expense of the poor. He bases this claim not simply on the usual critique of the barriers that Europe and the United States maintain against agricultural imports from developing countries but also on less familiar aspects of our trade with developing countries. For example, he points out that international corporations are willing to make deals to buy natural resources from any government, no matter how it has come to power. This provides a huge financial incentive for groups to try to overthrow the existing government. Successful rebels are rewarded by being able to sell off the nation's oil, minerals or timber.\nIn their dealings with corrupt dictators in developing countries, Pogge asserts, international corporations are morally no better than someone who knowingly buys stolen goods -- with the difference that the international legal and political order recognizes the corporations, not as criminals in possession of stolen goods but as the legal owners of the goods they have bought. This situation is, of course, beneficial for the industrial nations, because it enables us to obtain the raw materials we need to maintain our prosperity, but it is a disaster for resource-rich developing countries, turning the wealth that should benefit them into a curse that leads to a cycle of coups, civil wars and corruption and is of little benefit to the people as a whole.\nIn this light, our obligation to the poor is not just one of providing assistance to strangers but one of compensation for harms that we have caused and are still causing them. It might be argued that we do not owe the poor compensation, because our affluence actually benefits them. Living luxuriously, it is said, provides employment, and so wealth trickles down, helping the poor more effectively than aid does. But the rich in industrialized nations buy virtually nothing that is made by the very poor. During the past 20 years of economic globalization, although expanding trade has helped lift many of the world's poor out of poverty, it has failed to benefit the poorest 10 percent of the world's population. Some of the extremely poor, most of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa, have nothing to sell that rich people want, while others lack the infrastructure to get their goods to market. If they can get their crops to a port, European and U.S. subsidies often mean that they cannot sell them, despite -- as for example in the case of West African cotton growers who compete with vastly larger and richer U.S. cotton producers -- having a lower production cost than the subsidized producers in the rich nations.\nThe remedy to these problems, it might reasonably be suggested, should come from the state, not from private philanthropy. When aid comes through the government, everyone who earns above the tax-free threshold contributes something, with more collected from those with greater ability to pay. Much as we may applaud what Gates and Buffett are doing, we can also be troubled by a system that leaves the fate of hundreds of millions of people hanging on the decisions of two or three private citizens. But the amount of foreign development aid given by the U.S. government is, at 22 cents for every $100 the nation earns, about the same, as a percentage of gross national income, as Portugal gives and about half that of the U.K. Worse still, much of it is directed where it best suits U.S. strategic interests -- Iraq is now by far the largest recipient of U.S. development aid, and Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan and Afghanistan all rank in the Top 10. Less than a quarter of official U.S. development aid -- barely a nickel in every $100 of our G.N.I. -- goes to the world's poorest nations.\nAdding private philanthropy to U.S. government aid improves this picture, because Americans privately give more per capita to international philanthropic causes than the citizens of almost any other nation. Even when private donations are included, however, countries like Norway, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands give three or four times as much foreign aid, in proportion to the size of their economies, as the U.S. gives -- with a much larger percentage going to the poorest nations. At least as things now stand, the case for philanthropic efforts to relieve global poverty is not susceptible to the argument that the government has taken care of the problem. And even if official U.S. aid were better-directed and comparable, relative to our gross domestic product, with that of the most generous nations, there would still be a role for private philanthropy. Unconstrained by diplomatic considerations or the desire to swing votes at the United Nations, private donors can more easily avoid dealing with corrupt or wasteful governments. They can go directly into the field, working with local villages and grass-roots organizations.\nNor are philanthropists beholden to lobbyists. As The New York Times reported recently, billions of dollars of U.S. aid is tied to domestic goods. Wheat for Africa must be grown in America, although aid experts say this often depresses local African markets, reducing the incentive for farmers there to produce more. In a decision that surely costs lives, hundreds of millions of condoms intended to stop the spread of AIDS in Africa and around the world must be manufactured in the U.S., although they cost twice as much as similar products made in Asia.\nIn other ways, too, private philanthropists are free to venture where governments fear to tread. Through a foundation named for his wife, Susan Thompson Buffett, Warren Buffett has supported reproductive rights, including family planning and pro-choice organizations. In another unusual initiative, he has pledged $50 million for the International Atomic Energy Agency's plan to establish a \"fuel bank\" to supply nuclear-reactor fuel to countries that meet their nuclear-nonproliferation commitments. The idea, which has been talked about for many years, is widely agreed to be a useful step toward discouraging countries from building their own facilities for producing nuclear fuel, which could then be diverted to weapons production. It is, Buffett said, \"an investment in a safer world.\" Though it is something that governments could and should be doing, no government had taken the first step.\nAid has always had its critics. Carefully planned and intelligently directed private philanthropy may be the best answer to the claim that aid doesn't work. Of course, as in any large-scale human enterprise, some aid can be ineffective. But provided that aid isn't actually counterproductive, even relatively inefficient assistance is likely to do more to advance human wellbeing than luxury spending by the wealthy.\nThe rich, then, should give. But how much should they give? Gates may have given away nearly $30 billion, but that still leaves him sitting at the top of the Forbes list of the richest Americans, with $53 billion. His 66,000-square-foot high-tech lakeside estate near Seattle is reportedly worth more than $100 million. Property taxes are about $1 million. Among his possessions is the Leicester Codex, the only handwritten book by Leonardo da Vinci still in private hands, for which he paid $30.8 million in 1994. Has Bill Gates done enough? More pointedly, you might ask: if he really believes that all lives have equal value, what is he doing living in such an expensive house and owning a Leonardo Codex? Are there no more lives that could be saved by living more modestly and adding the money thus saved to the amount he has already given?\nYet we should recognize that, if judged by the proportion of his wealth that he has given away, Gates compares very well with most of the other people on the Forbes 400 list, including his former colleague and Microsoft co-founder, Paul Allen. Allen, who left the company in 1983, has given, over his lifetime, more than $800 million to philanthropic causes. That is far more than nearly any of us will ever be able to give. But Forbes lists Allen as the fifth-richest American, with a net worth of $16 billion. He owns the Seattle Seahawks, the Portland Trailblazers, a 413-foot oceangoing yacht that carries two helicopters and a 60-foot submarine. He has given only about 5 percent of his total wealth.\nIs there a line of moral adequacy that falls between the 5 percent that Allen has given away and the roughly 35 percent that Gates has donated? Few people have set a personal example that would allow them to tell Gates that he has not given enough, but one who could is Zell Kravinsky. A few years ago, when he was in his mid-40s, Kravinsky gave almost all of his $45 million real estate fortune to health-related charities, retaining only his modest family home in Jenkintown, near Philadelphia, and enough to meet his family's ordinary expenses. After learning that thousands of people with failing kidneys die each year while waiting for a transplant, he contacted a Philadelphia hospital and donated one of his kidneys to a complete stranger.\nAfter reading about Kravinsky in The New Yorker, I invited him to speak to my classes at Princeton. He comes across as anguished by the failure of others to see the simple logic that lies behind his altruism. Kravinsky has a mathematical mind -- a talent that obviously helped him in deciding what investments would prove profitable -- and he says that the chances of dying as a result of donating a kidney are about 1 in 4,000. For him this implies that to withhold a kidney from someone who would otherwise die means valuing one's own life at 4,000 times that of a stranger, a ratio Kravinsky considers \"obscene.\"\nWhat marks Kravinsky from the rest of us is that he takes the equal value of all human life as a guide to life, not just as a nice piece of rhetoric. He acknowledges that some people think he is crazy, and even his wife says she believes that he goes too far. One of her arguments against the kidney donation was that one of their children may one day need a kidney, and Zell could be the only compatible donor. Kravinsky's love for his children is, as far as I can tell, as strong as that of any normal parent. Such attachments are part of our nature, no doubt the product of our evolution as mammals who give birth to children, who for an unusually long time require our assistance in order to survive. But that does not, in Kravinsky's view, justify our placing a value on the lives of our children that is thousands of times greater than the value we place on the lives of the children of strangers. Asked if he would allow his child to die if it would enable a thousand children to live, Kravinsky said yes. Indeed, he has said he would permit his child to die even if this enabled only two other children to live. Nevertheless, to appease his wife, he recently went back into real estate, made some money and bought the family a larger home. But he still remains committed to giving away as much as possible, subject only to keeping his domestic life reasonably tranquil.\nBuffett says he believes in giving his children \"enough so they feel they could do anything, but not so much that they could do nothing.\" That means, in his judgment, \"a few hundred thousand\" each. In absolute terms, that is far more than most Americans are able to leave their children and, by Kravinsky's standard, certainly too much. (Kravinsky says that the hard part is not giving away the first $45 million but the last $10,000, when you have to live so cheaply that you can't function in the business world.) But even if Buffett left each of his three children a million dollars each, he would still have given away more than 99.99 percent of his wealth. When someone does that much -- especially in a society in which the norm is to leave most of your wealth to your children -- it is better to praise them than to cavil about the extra few hundred thousand dollars they might have given.\nPhilosophers like Liam Murphy of New York University and my colleague Kwame Anthony Appiah at Princeton contend that our obligations are limited to carrying our fair share of the burden of relieving global poverty. They would have us calculate how much would be required to ensure that the world's poorest people have a chance at a decent life, and then divide this sum among the affluent. That would give us each an amount to donate, and having given that, we would have fulfilled our obligations to the poor.\nWhat might that fair amount be? One way of calculating it would be to take as our target, at least for the next nine years, the Millennium Development Goals, set by the United Nations Millennium Summit in 2000. On that occasion, the largest gathering of world leaders in history jointly pledged to meet, by 2015, a list of goals that include:\nReducing by half the proportion of the world's people in extreme poverty (defined as living on less than the purchasing-power equivalent of one U.S. dollar per day).\nReducing by half the proportion of people who suffer from hunger.\nEnsuring that children everywhere are able to take a full course of primary schooling.\nEnding sex disparity in education.\nReducing by two-thirds the mortality rate among children under 5.\nReducing by three-quarters the rate of maternal mortality.\nHalting and beginning to reverse the spread of H.I.V./AIDS and halting and beginning to reduce the incidence of malaria and other major diseases.\nReducing by half the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water.\nLast year a United Nations task force, led by the Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs, estimated the annual cost of meeting these goals to be $121 billion in 2006, rising to $189 billion by 2015. When we take account of existing official development aid promises, the additional amount needed each year to meet the goals is only $48 billion for 2006 and $74 billion for 2015.\nNow let's look at the incomes of America's rich and superrich, and ask how much they could reasonably give. The task is made easier by statistics recently provided by Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, economists at the Acole Normale Suparieure, Paris-Jourdan, and the University of California, Berkeley, respectively, based on U.S. tax data for 2004. Their figures are for pretax income, excluding income from capital gains, which for the very rich are nearly always substantial. For simplicity I have rounded the figures, generally downward. Note too that the numbers refer to \"tax units,\" that is, in many cases, families rather than individuals.\nPiketty and Saez's top bracket comprises 0.01 percent of U.S. taxpayers. There are 14,400 of them, earning an average of $12,775,000, with total earnings of $184 billion. The minimum annual income in this group is more than $5 million, so it seems reasonable to suppose that they could, without much hardship, give away a third of their annual income, an average of $4.3 million each, for a total of around $61 billion. That would still leave each of them with an annual income of at least $3.3 million.\nNext comes the rest of the top 0.1 percent (excluding the category just described, as I shall do henceforth). There are 129,600 in this group, with an average income of just over $2 million and a minimum income of $1.1 million. If they were each to give a quarter of their income, that would yield about $65 billion, and leave each of them with at least $846,000 annually.\nThe top 0.5 percent consists of 575,900 taxpayers, with an average income of $623,000 and a minimum of $407,000. If they were to give one-fifth of their income, they would still have at least $325,000 each, and they would be giving a total of $72 billion.\nComing down to the level of those in the top 1 percent, we find 719,900 taxpayers with an average income of $327,000 and a minimum of $276,000. They could comfortably afford to give 15 percent of their income. That would yield $35 billion and leave them with at least $234,000.\nFinally, the remainder of the nation's top 10 percent earn at least $92,000 annually, with an average of $132,000. There are nearly 13 million in this group. If they gave the traditional tithe -- 10 percent of their income, or an average of $13,200 each -- this would yield about $171 billion and leave them a minimum of $83,000.\nYou could spend a long time debating whether the fractions of income I have suggested for donation constitute the fairest possible scheme. Perhaps the sliding scale should be steeper, so that the superrich give more and the merely comfortable give less. And it could be extended beyond the Top 10 percent of American families, so that everyone able to afford more than the basic necessities of life gives something, even if it is as little as 1 percent. Be that as it may, the remarkable thing about these calculations is that a scale of donations that is unlikely to impose significant hardship on anyone yields a total of $404 billion -- from just 10 percent of American families.\nObviously, the rich in other nations should share the burden of relieving global poverty. The U.S. is responsible for 36 percent of the gross domestic product of all Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations. Arguably, because the U.S. is richer than all other major nations, and its wealth is more unevenly distributed than wealth in almost any other industrialized country, the rich in the U.S. should contribute more than 36 percent of total global donations. So somewhat more than 36 percent of all aid to relieve global poverty should come from the U.S. For simplicity, let's take half as a fair share for the U.S. On that basis, extending the scheme I have suggested worldwide would provide $808 billion annually for development aid. That's more than six times what the task force chaired by Sachs estimated would be required for 2006 in order to be on track to meet the Millennium Development Goals, and more than 16 times the shortfall between that sum and existing official development aid commitments.\nIf we are obliged to do no more than our fair share of eliminating global poverty, the burden will not be great. But is that really all we ought to do? Since we all agree that fairness is a good thing, and none of us like doing more because others don't pull their weight, the fair-share view is attractive. In the end, however, I think we should reject it. Let's return to the drowning child in the shallow pond. Imagine it is not 1 small child who has fallen in, but 50 children. We are among 50 adults, unrelated to the children, picnicking on the lawn around the pond. We can easily wade into the pond and rescue the children, and the fact that we would find it cold and unpleasant sloshing around in the knee-deep muddy water is no justification for failing to do so. The \"fair share\" theorists would say that if we each rescue one child, all the children will be saved, and so none of us have an obligation to save more than one. But what if half the picnickers prefer staying clean and dry to rescuing any children at all? Is it acceptable if the rest of us stop after we have rescued just one child, knowing that we have done our fair share, but that half the children will drown? We might justifiably be furious with those who are not doing their fair share, but our anger with them is not a reason for letting the children die. In terms of praise and blame, we are clearly right to condemn, in the strongest terms, those who do nothing. In contrast, we may withhold such condemnation from those who stop when they have done their fair share. Even so, they have let children drown when they could easily have saved them, and that is wrong.\nSimilarly, in the real world, it should be seen as a serious moral failure when those with ample income do not do their fair share toward relieving global poverty. It isn't so easy, however, to decide on the proper approach to take to those who limit their contribution to their fair share when they could easily do more and when, because others are not playing their part, a further donation would assist many in desperate need. In the privacy of our own judgment, we should believe that it is wrong not to do more. But whether we should actually criticize people who are doing their fair share, but no more than that, depends on the psychological impact that such criticism will have on them, and on others. This in turn may depend on social practices. If the majority are doing little or nothing, setting a standard higher than the fair-share level may seem so demanding that it discourages people who are willing to make an equitable contribution from doing even that. So it may be best to refrain from criticizing those who achieve the fair-share level. In moving our society's standards forward, we may have to progress one step at a time.\nFor more than 30 years, I've been reading, writing and teaching about the ethical issue posed by the juxtaposition, on our planet, of great abundance and life-threatening poverty. Yet it was not until, in preparing this article, I calculated how much America's Top 10 percent of income earners actually make that I fully understood how easy it would be for the world's rich to eliminate, or virtually eliminate, global poverty. (It has actually become much easier over the last 30 years, as the rich have grown significantly richer.) I found the result astonishing. I double-checked the figures and asked a research assistant to check them as well. But they were right. Measured against our capacity, the Millennium Development Goals are indecently, shockingly modest. If we fail to achieve them -- as on present indications we well might -- we have no excuses. The target we should be setting for ourselves is not halving the proportion of people living in extreme poverty, and without enough to eat, but ensuring that no one, or virtually no one, needs to live in such degrading conditions. That is a worthy goal, and it is well within our reach.\nPeter Singer is the Ira W. DeCamp professor of bioethics at the Center for Human Values at Princeton University. He is the author of many books, including most recently \"The Way We Eat: Why Our Food Choices Matter.\"",

    "text": "U.S. Muslim Clerics Seek a Modern Middle Ground\n2006-06-18T04:00:00.000Z\nEvery seat in the auditorium at the University of Houston was taken, and the crowd was standing in the back and spilling out into the lobby, straining to hear. The two men onstage began to speak to the crowd in Arabic, with such flawless accents and rarefied Koranic grammar that some audience members gaped when they heard the Arabic equivalent of the king's English coming from the mouths of two Americans. \nSheik Hamza Yusuf, in a groomed goatee and sports jacket, looked more like a hip white college professor than a Middle Eastern sheik. Imam Zaid Shakir, a lanky African-American in a long brown tunic, looked as if he would fit in just fine on the streets of Damascus. \nBoth men are converts to Islam who spent years in the Middle East and North Africa being mentored by formidable Muslim scholars. They have since become leading intellectual lights for a new generation of American Muslims looking for homegrown leaders who can help them learn how to live their faith without succumbing to American materialism or Islamic extremism. \n\"This is the wealthiest Muslim community on earth,\" Mr. Shakir told the crowd, quickly adding that \"the wealth here has been earned\" \u2014 unlike, he said, in the oil-rich Middle East. As the audience laughed at Mr. Shakir's flattery, he chided them for buying Lexuses \u2014 with heated leather seats they would never need in Houston \u2014 and Jaguars, and made them laugh again by pronouncing it \"Jaguoooaah,\" like a stuffy Anglophile. \nAnd then he issued a challenge: \"Where are the Muslim Doctors Without Borders? Spend six months here, six months in the Congo. Form it!\"\nMost American mosques import their clerics from overseas \u2014 some who preach extremism, some who cannot speak English, and most who cannot begin to speak to young American Muslims growing up on hip-hop and in mixed-sex chat rooms. Mr. Yusuf, 48, and Mr. Shakir, 50, are using their clout to create the first Islamic seminary in the United States, where they hope to train a new generation of imams and scholars who can reconcile Islam and American culture.\nThe seminary is still in its fledgling stages, but Mr. Yusuf and Mr. Shakir have gained a large following by being equally at home in Islamic tradition and modern American culture. Mr. Yusuf dazzles his audiences by weaving into one of his typical half-hour talks quotations from St. Augustine, Patton, Eric Erikson, Jung, Solzhenitsyn, Auden, Robert Bly, Gen. William C. Westmoreland and the Bible. He is the host of a TV reality show that is popular in the Middle East, in which he takes a vanload of Arabs on a road trip across the United States to visit people who might challenge Arab stereotypes about Americans, like the antiwar protesters demonstrating outside the Republican National Convention.\n Mr. Shakir mixes passages from the Koran with a few lines of rap, and channels accents from ghetto to Valley Girl. Some of his students call him the next Malcolm X \u2014 out of his earshot, because he so often preaches the importance of humility. \nBoth men draw overflow crowds in theaters, mosques and university auditoriums that seat thousands. Their books and CD's are pored over by young Muslims in study groups. As scholars and proselytizers of the faith, they have a much higher profile than most imams, as Muslim clerics who are usually in charge of mosques are known. Their message is that both Islam and America have gone seriously astray, and that American Muslims have a responsibility to harness their growing numbers and economic power to help set them straight. \nThey say that Islam must be rescued from extremists who selectively cite Islamic scripture to justify terrorism. Though Mr. Yusuf and Mr. Shakir do not denounce particular scholars or schools of thought, their students say the two are challenging the influence of Islam's more reactionary sects, like Wahhabism and Salafism, which has been spread to American mosques and schools by clerics trained in Saudi Arabia. Where Wahhabism and Salafism are often intolerant of other religions \u2014 even of other streams within Islam \u2014 Mr. Yusuf and Mr. Shakir teach that Islam is open to a diversity of interpretations honed by centuries of scholars. \nMr. Yusuf told the audience in Houston to beware of \"fanatics\" who pluck Islamic scripture out of context and say, \"We're going to tell you what God says on every single issue.\"\n\"That's not Islam,\" Mr. Yusuf said. \"That's psychopathy.\"\nHe asked the audience to pray for the victims of kidnappers in Iraq, saying that kidnapping is just as bad as American bombings in which the military dismisses the civilians killed as \"collateral damage.\"\n\"They're both sinister, as far as I'm concerned,\" he said. \"One is efficient, the other is pathetic.\"\nBoth Mr. Shakir and Mr. Yusuf have a history of anti-American rhetoric, but with age, they have tempered their views. Mr. Shakir told the Houston audience that they are blessed to live in a country that is stable and safe, and in which they have thrived.\nWhen it came time for questions, one young man stepped to the microphone and asked: \"You said we have an obligation to humanity. Did you mean to Muslims, or to everyone?\" \nMr. Shakir responded: \"The obligation is to everyone. All of the people are the dependents of Allah.\"\nWhen Mr. Shakir and Mr. Yusuf stepped off the stage, they were mobbed by a crowd that personified the breadth of their following. There were students in college sweatshirts, doctors and limousine drivers in suits. There were immigrants from Asia, the Middle East and Africa, and the grown children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the immigrant generation. There were plenty of African-Americans (as many as a third of American Muslims are black), and a sprinkling of white and Hispanic converts. There were women in all kinds of head scarves, and women without.\nMr. Yusuf and Mr. Shakir posed for pictures and signed their CD's, books and DVD's \u2014 the two men combined have more than 80 items on the market. A young couple thanked Mr. Yusuf for his CD set on Muslim marriage, saying it had saved theirs. A family from Indonesia asked him to interpret a dream. An older woman from Iraq begged him to contact Muslim scholars in her homeland and correct their misguided teaching. \nAfter waiting for more than an hour to greet the scholars, Sohail Ansari, an information technology specialist originally from India, marveled, \"I was born a Muslim, and these guys are so far ahead of us.\" \nEncouraging Tolerance\nMr. Yusuf lives on a cul-de-sac in Danville, a Northern California suburb, in a house with a three-car garage. The living room is spread with Persian rugs; it is mostly bare of furniture. He held a dinner with guests in traditional Arab style \u2014 on the floor, while the smallest of his five sons curled up in the rugs and fell asleep. His wife, Liliana, tired from a day of home-schooling and driving the boys to karate lessons, passed around take-out curry. She converted to Islam after meeting Mr. Yusuf in college, to the chagrin of her Catholic Hispanic parents. The couple married outdoors, in a redwood grove. \nMr. Yusuf received the Arabic title of sheik from his teachers in Mauritania, in West Africa. There the honorific is usually given to old men with a deep knowledge of Islam who serve their communities as wise oracles, but Mr. Yusuf was only 28. His given name was Mark Hanson, and he was raised Greek Orthodox in a bohemian but affluent part of Marin County, just north of San Francisco. \nHe converted to Islam after a near-fatal car accident in high school sent him on an existential journey. He said that the simplicity of \"no God but Allah\" made far more sense to him than the Trinity, and he found the five daily prayers a constant call to awe about everything from the sun to his capillaries. \nThe American seminary was Mr. Yusuf's idea. His diagnosis of the problem with Islam today is that its followers lack \"religious knowledge.\" Islam, like Judaism, is based in scripture and law that has been interpreted, reinterpreted and debated for centuries by scholars who inspired four schools of Islamic jurisprudence. Mr. Yusuf laments that many of the seminaries that once flourished in the Muslim world are now either gone or intellectually dead. Now, he said, the sharpest Muslim students go into technical fields like engineering, not religion. \nHe said he believed that if more Muslims were schooled in their faith's diverse intellectual streams and had a holistic understanding of their religion, they would not be so susceptible to the Osama bin Ladens who tell them that suicide bombers are martyrs.\n\"Where you don't have people who have strong intellectual capacity, you get demagoguery,\" he said.\nMr. Yusuf once was a source of the kind of zealous rhetoric he now denounces. He said in 1995 that Judaism was based on the belief that \"God has this bias to this small little tribe in the middle of the desert,\" which makes it \"a most racist religion.\" On Sept. 9, 2001, he said the United States \"stands condemned\" for invading Muslim lands. \nHe has since changed his tune \u2014 not for spin, he says, but on principle. \"Our community has failed, and I include myself in that,\" he told an audience in a downtown theater in Elizabeth, N.J., this year. \"When I started speaking in the early 90's, our discourse was not balanced.\n\"We were focused so often on what was negative about this country,\" he said. \"We ended up alienating some people. I've said some things about other religions that I regret now. I think they were incorrect.\" \nHe added: \"A tree grows. If you're staying the same, something is wrong. You're not alive.\"\nAn Enthusiastic Following\nMr. Yusuf named his school the Zaytuna Institute \u2014 Arabic for olive tree, and also the name of a renowned Islamic university in Tunisia. The site, adjacent to a busy boulevard in Hayward, Calif., is an unlikely oasis, the air scented by jasmine bushes and flowering vines. \nFive times a day, starting around 5 a.m., a teacher or a student stands outside the prayer hall and warbles the call to prayer. In the mornings, few respond, but by evening, the hall is filled with the rustling of men and women dropping to their knees, divided by a wooden screen. \nThe prayer hall was once a church. There is also a yurt and a high backboard used as a target for archery, because the Prophet Muhammad recommended it as an athletic activity. (The backboard will soon come down to avoid alarming neighbors who might balk at seeing Muslims with bows and arrows). \nOn a sunny day, one student, Ousmane Bah, sat outside the yurt, washing the ink off a polished wooden slate on which he had written his lesson for the past week, which he had committed to memory. The lesson, written in Arabic poetry, was about what makes a fair trade. Near the yurt, BART trains sped by. \n\"The United States is the capital of modernity,\" Mr. Bah said, \"and you have this very traditional Islam, which is 1,400 years old, being taught in this modern world.\" \nMany American universities have Islamic studies departments, and a program at Hartford Seminary accredits Muslim chaplains. But there is no program in the United States like Zaytuna.\nHundreds of Muslims come to Zaytuna for evening and weekend classes on the Prophet Muhammad, the Koran and the Arabic language. The institute's full-time seminary program is in the pilot phase, with only six students. It is expected to double its enrollment next fall.\nBesides Mr. Bah, there are two women \u2014 one a former software engineer, the other a former prenatal genetic counselor \u2014 and three men \u2014 a former jazz musician from Maryland, a motorcycle mechanic from Atlanta and a son of Bangladeshi immigrants in New York City who chose Zaytuna over the Ivy League.\n\"Sheik Hamza and Imam Zaid have grown up here after having studied abroad, and you can really connect with them,\" said the New Yorker, Ebadur Rahman, who is 19. \"The scholars who come from abroad, they can't connect with the people. They're ignorant of life here.\"\nIslamic studies experts say that what Mr. Yusuf and Mr. Shakir are teaching is traditional orthodox Islam, and that it is impossible to characterize their theology as either conservative or liberal. They encourage but do not require women in class to cover their heads. They have hired a female scholar, who teaches only women. Last year, Mr. Shakir published a rebuttal to a group of progressive American Muslims who argue that Islamic law allows women to lead men in prayer. \nMr. Yusuf says he has become too busy to teach regularly at his own school. He writes books, translates Arabic poetry, records CD's, tapes his television show. He meets with rabbis, ministers and the Dalai Lama, and travels annually to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \nMr. Yusuf's fame grew after he was invited to the White House nine days after the Sept. 11 attacks, making him the only Muslim leader along with five other religious leaders who were called to meet with President Bush. He suggested that Mr. Bush change the name of the military's impending operation in Afghanistan, \"Infinite Justice,\" because it would offend Muslims, who believe the only source of infinite justice is God. Mr. Bush responded by changing the operation's name to \"Operation Enduring Freedom,\" and in the news media Mr. Yusuf gained a title other than sheik: \"adviser to the president.\" \nMr. Yusuf, however, said that Mr. Bush since then \"hasn't taken any of my advice.\" \nPersuasion Over Violence\nThree years ago, Mr. Yusuf invited Mr. Shakir to teach at Zaytuna as a scholar in residence. Mr. Shakir had recently returned from his second stint of studying Islam abroad \u2014 a total of seven years in Syria and Morocco. \nOne recent Sunday afternoon, Mr. Shakir had 50 students in his Zaytuna class on marriage and family. The women brought their babies and their knitting, and everyone munched on homemade cookies brought for a cookie-baking contest. \n\"It's going to be hard to beat this oatmeal raisin,\" Mr. Shakir said between swigs of organic milk. \nThe real topic at hand was whether polygamy, which is permitted in Islam, is appropriate in the modern context. Mr. Shakir mediated a heated debate between the men and women who sparred across the wooden divider that separated them. \nOne man said that having more than one wife was good because some women are so \"career orientated\" that \"they don't want to be cleaning up all the time behind the man.\" At that, one woman shouted out, \"Get a maid!\" and everyone dissolved in laughter. \nMr. Shakir told the students that Islam allows polygamy because it was a \"practical\" and \"compassionate\" solution in some cases, as when women are widowed in war. But in the modern context, he said, \"a lot of harm ensues.\"\nMr. Shakir said afterward that he still had trouble believing how a boy from the projects could have become an Islamic scholar with students who are willing to move across the country to study with him.\n He and his wife, Saliha, became Muslims in the Air Force. He had joined the military as a teenager in the lull after Vietnam because his mother had died and he had no means. His name was Ricky Mitchell, and his mother had raised him and his siblings in housing projects in Georgia \u2014 where he remembers going to his grandparents' farm and picking cotton \u2014 and in New Britain, Conn.\nA Goal for America\nWhile leading a mosque in New Haven in 1992, Mr. Shakir wrote a pamphlet that cautioned Muslims not to be co-opted by American politics. He wrote, \"Islam presents an absolutist political agenda, or one which doesn't lend itself to compromise, nor to coalition building.\" \nWhile he did not denounce Muslims who take part in politics, he pointed out the effectiveness of \"extrasystemic political action\" \u2014 like the \"armed struggle\" that brought about the rule of the Taliban in Afghanistan. A copy of the pamphlet was found in the apartment of a suspect in the first World Trade Center bombing, in 1993. Mr. Shakir says he was questioned by the F.B.I., but had no link to the man, and that was the end of it. \nWhile studying in Syria a few years later, he visited Hama, a city that had tried to revolt against the Syrian ruler, Hafez al-Assad. Mr. Shakir said he saw mass graves and bulldozed neighborhoods, and talked with widows of those killed. He gave up on the idea of armed struggle, he said, \"just seeing the reality of where revolution can end.\"\nAsked now about his past, he said, \"To be perfectly honest, I don't regret anything I've done or said.\"\nHe added, \"I had to go through that stage to become the person that I am, and I'm not willing to negate my past.\" \nHe said he still hoped that one day the United States would be a Muslim country ruled by Islamic law, \"not by violent means, but by persuasion.\" \n\"Every Muslim who is honest would say, I would like to see America become a Muslim country,\" he said. \"I think it would help people, and if I didn't believe that, I wouldn't be a Muslim. Because Islam helped me as a person, and it's helped a lot of people in my community.\" ",

Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100. (Roberta Smith)\n BROOKLYN MUSEUM: \u2018WATERCOLORS BY WALTON FORD,\u2019 through Jan. 28. This show assembles more than 50 of Mr. Ford\u2019s large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora, produced since the early \u201990s. They frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images the sense is that some horrible violence has occurred or is about to happen. This artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000.\n (Benjamin Genocchio)\n \u2605 FRICK COLLECTION: \u2018DOMENICO TIEPOLO (1727-1804): A NEW TESTAMENT,\u2019 through Jan. 7. The 60 ink drawings by Domenico Tiepolo, son of the Italian master painter Giambattista, have a funny kind of jitter. They look as if they were maybe woven from hair-fine brambles, or done on a ride over rough ground, or in a state of agitated elation. Illustrations of episodes from the four Gospels, they are among some 300 drawings the artist did on subject in a project that seems to have been an extended exercise in personal piety. In them the Christian story of salvation becomes an operatic epic, gravely serious but with notes of homely sweetness: Jesus in Gethsemane delivers his aria of mortal doubt and pain high up on a bare stage, all alone; the Virgin Mary\u2019s mother, Anna, aged and stooped, is cosseted by angel-nurses who guide her every step. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter)\n \u2605 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: \u2018SPANISH PAINTING FROM EL GRECO TO PICASSO,\u2019 through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Vel\u00e1zquezes and Zurbar\u00e1ns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dal\u00eds and Picassos, many famous, many not. The big point is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman) \n \u2605 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920S,\u2019 through Feb. 19. This show\u2019s 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic\u2019s porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) \n \u2605 THE MET: \u2018LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL \u2014 AN ARTIST\u2019S COUNTRY ESTATE,\u2019 through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house- museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound \u2014 and of the Tiffany residences preceding it \u2014 is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany\u2019s genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)\n \u2605 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: \u2018SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,\u2019 through March 4. Saul Steinberg\u2019s famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything \u2014 Floridians, linguistic concepts, erotica, cowboys, Cubism, nature, architecture and women \u2014 with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 drawings, collages and constructions, arranged in chronological order, goes on, Steinberg\u2019s progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like \u201cFeet on Chair\u201d (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like \u201cStreet War (Cadavre Exquisis)\u201d (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008. (Grace Glueck)\n \u2605 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: \u2018MANET AND THE EXECUTION OF MAXIMILIAN,\u2019 through Jan. 29. This small, gripping, focused show reminds us of Modernism\u2019s mutinous, myth-scouring origins. And it does so by bringing one of art\u2019s great path-cutters, Edouard Manet, onto the scene, wry, politically infuriated and painting like Lucifer. There\u2019s not a lot of him here \u2014 eight paintings, three on a single theme: the death by firing squad of the Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian in Mexico in 1867. But it\u2019s enough. Manet\u2019s images, surrounded here by a riveting selection of prints and photographs, are electrifying, a new kind of history painting that turned an art of pre-set ideals into one of mutable and unpredictable realities. (212) 708-9400. \n(Cotter)\n \u2605 MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: \u2018A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG\u2019S NEW YORK,\u2019 through March 25. A very lively adjunct to the Morgan show, this smaller display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here looming majestically over humble brownstones and in another incarnation, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg\u2019s eyes, could be monuments, too. And no one ever fully appreciated the impact of upscale New York women until Steinberg the misogynist came along. \u201cFur Coats\u201d (1951), portrays four expensive baroque pelts wearing four women, and it\u2019s dead on. You may think you know Steinberg\u2019s work, but these shows make it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672. (Glueck)\n \u2605 NEUE GALLERY: \u2018JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,\u2019 through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Mr. Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or \u201ctotal work of art,\u201d orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. Neue Gallery, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)\n  \u2605 NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: \u2018LEGACIES: CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS REFLECT ON SLAVERY,\u2019 through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn\u2019t really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the \u201960s, a century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the \u201cEmancipation Approximation,\u201d as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show. 2 West 77th Street, Manhattan, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Cotter)\n STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: \u2018AFRICA COMICS,\u2019 through March 18. Intense is the word for this modest-size, first-time United States survey of designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense, the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. The entertainment value is high. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids, and the schlumpy but wily character named Goorgoolou from Senegal. But more often than not, humor is sugarcoating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter) \n WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: KIKI SMITH: \u2018A GATHERING, 1980-2005,\u2019 through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float in \u201cKiki Smith\u201d: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum\u2019s black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith\u2019s art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Cotter)\nGalleries: Uptown\n \u2605 \u2018AMERICAN MASTERWORKS FROM THE MUNSON-WILLIAMS-PROCTOR ARTS INSTITUTE\u2019 This Utica, N.Y., institution, celebrating its educational alliance with New York City\u2019s Pratt Institute, is showing more than 75 paintings, drawings, sculptures and furniture pieces, from the 18th to the 20th centuries. A highlight is the original version of Thomas Cole\u2019s moving allegory \u201cThe Voyage of Life\u201d (1839-40), which in four monumental canvases compares the journey from childhood to old age with the winding course of a river. A smashing portrait of the Revolutionary War general Peter Gansevoort (about 1794) by Gilbert Stuart and a luscious still life of a steak and with a cabbage and a carrot by Raphaelle Peale (1816-17) are distinguished entries from the earlier part of the show. Post-World War II paintings by Pollock and Rothko add to the buzz. Hirschl & Adler, 21 East 70th Street, (212) 535-8810, through Dec. 29. (Glueck)\n \u2605 JOHN CURRIN The leading bad boy of figurative painting is trying his best to be even more provocative. While he usually paints in series, here he has many options under consideration: pornography, romance, still life, portraits of all kinds. The result is a Currin medley that functions as a kind of installation brought off with a new, somewhat vacuous facility. But the paintings with the most Currinesque goofiness and distortions are still the best. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313, through Dec. 22. (Smith)\n \u2605 \u2018THE ODYSSEY CONTINUES: MASTERWORKS FROM THE NEW ORLEANS MUSEUM OF ART AND FROM PRIVATE NEW ORLEANS COLLECTIONS\u2019 Nearly 100 European and American objects covering six centuries, from the New Orleans Museum of Art but also from private lenders, are displayed, ranging from the Venetian-born Lorenzo Lotto whose forceful study of an authoritative figure, \u201cPortrait of a Bearded Man\u201d (1530-35) is a highlight, to works by contemporary Americans. A showstopper is a full-length portrait of Marie Antoinette (about 1788), by Elizabeth Vigee-Lebrun, in which the doomed French queen wears an enormous feathered concoction on the head she was eventually to lose. Sculptures by Rodin, Brancusi, Louise Bourgeois and Louise Nevelson are also part of the treasures on view. The show is a benefit for the New Orleans Museum, whose building \u2014 though not its art \u2014 was battered by Hurricane Katrina. Wildenstein, 19 East 64th Street, (212) 879-0500, through Feb. 9. (Glueck) \nSIGMAR POLKE Painting is man\u2019s oldest conjuring trick, and Sigmar Polke is one of its reigning magicians. In this show, new paintings and those from the 1980s, all two-sided and painted with resin, surround a small selection of German Baroque amber (Bernstein is German for amber) jewelry and exquisite tchotchkes. The paintings, made translucent by the resin, nearly defy deciphering. Doodles and abstract splashes of white paint overlay murky washes of glowing resin on both sides of their membranous support, then cast dim shadows on the wall behind, so that the pictures seem suspended in midair, floating. Michael Werner Gallery, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623, through Jan. 13. \n(Kimmelman) \n  \nGalleries: SoHo\nSLATER BRADLEY: \u2018THE ABANDONMENTS\u2019 This show features six new, contemplative video works by this 31-year old artist. In \u201cDark Night of the Soul\u201d (2005-6), which invokes Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d a figure in a space suit is shown wandering through the exotic scenery of the American Museum of Natural History after hours, to the poetic sound of a flute. The chic, odd camera angles suggest detachment, making the suited figure seem as if he were visiting some strange, remote world. Team Gallery, 83 Grand Street, (212) 279-9219, teamgallery.com, through Dec. 23. (Genocchio) \nGalleries: Chelsea\n  NATHAN CARTER On the surface, Mr. Carter\u2019s work is all about communication, transportation and networks. Big, sprawling sculptures and rough collages recreate the hectic spaghetti of subway lines and the intricate wiring of radio circuitry. The work itself cultivates the look of the amateur, the hobbyist with a ham radio or a backyard workshop and a jigsaw churning out crudely built constructions that look as if they might topple over at any second. At the same time, there\u2019s an offhanded vapidity to these references that suggests that they are little more than visual candy for the graphically attuned eye. Casey Kaplan, 525 West 21st Street, (212) 645-7335; caseykaplangallery.com, through Dec. 22. (Martha Schwendener) \n CHRIS DUNCAN: THE CONTINUED EXPLORATION OF PINK AND BROWN In his New York debut, this young artist from Oakland, Calif., continues the tradition of men who draw (and glue) by sewing that dates back at least to Alan Shields. His richly colored, semi-abstract works on paper, sometimes sewn together into expansive surfaces, combine geometric structures with scattered drips, accrue into playful but quietly magnetic m\u00e9langes of decorative and mystical, and East and West. Jeff Bailey Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 989-0156, through Dec. 22. (Smith) \n \u2605 GEORGE ORTMAN: EARLY CONSTRUCTIONS, NEW SCULPTURE In the late 1950s and early \u201960s, Mr. Ortman combined paint, canvas, plaster and wood into geometric reliefs whose every element was physically discrete. Hailed as exemplary \u201cspecific objects\u201d by Donald Judd, they took some tips from Jasper Johns\u2019s flag and target paintings and gave others to Judd\u2019s own work. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 242-6242, through Dec. 23. (Smith)\n \u2605 TL SOLEIN: INSULATUS In these large, ingeniously-made works on paper, which combine stenciling, bright cutout collage and washy fields of color, Mr. Solein brings his considerable pictorial sense to bear on \u201cMoby-Dick.\u201d He borrows from 19th-century illustration and folk art as well as personal memory, creating intimate stage-set-like scenes that can evoke anything from puppet shows to Cubism. The results frequently dazzle and sustain comparison with equally well-sourced but better-known paper wizards, from Donald Baechler to Jockum Nordstrom. Luise Ross Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 343-2161, through Dec. 23. (Smith)\nLast Chance\n LUCIAN FREUD The latest efforts of this British painter conform to a certain Freudian formula. Whether nudes or portraits, most paintings make palpable the claustrophobia of the studio and its harsh light, the dead weight of the people posing and the continuous effort on the painter\u2019s part to get things right. As usual there are occasional forays into the outside world and a rather startling self-portrait. \u201cThe Painter Surprised by a Naked Admirer\u201d shows the artist with a naked female model clinging to his leg as he stands (clothed) poised to work on the very painting we are looking at. Acquavella Galleries, 18 East 79th Street, Manhattan, (212) 734-6300, closes Wednesday. (Smith)\n \u2605 RICHARD HAMILTON This British artist, born in 1922, is famous for having coined the term Pop Art and for pioneering the aesthetic it defined. Yet he remains little known here. The Dickinson and Roundell show is his first New York career survey since 1973. Given its small scale, it can\u2019t help but be a scrappy affair, but it is a piece of history. Dickinson Roundell, 19 East 66th Street, Manhattan, (212) 772-8083, closes today. (Cotter) \n PAUL LEE Queer coding has long been a protective necessity, a cultural binder and a source of pleasure, in art no less than in life. Paul Lee, born in London and in his early 30s, explores it in his fragile sculptures and gently prods its mechanisms without fully exposing or demythologizing them. He gives us the props associated with erotically charged environments \u2014 back rooms, baths, parks \u2014 but also preserves a quality of hiddenness, mystery. Massimo Audiello, 526 West 26th Street, No. 519, Chelsea, (212) 675-9082 , massimoaudiello.com, closes tomorrow. (Cotter)\n \u2605 THE MUSEUM AT F.I.T.: \u2018LOVE AND WAR: THE WEAPONIZED WOMAN.\u2019 From a museum known for elucidating both the erotic and architectural nature of clothing design, this characteristically handsome exhibition examines the influence of garments of love and seduction (lingerie) and of war (armor and military uniforms) on modern and contemporary couturiers. The Museum at F.I.T., Fashion Institute of Technology, Seventh Avenue at 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 217-5800, fitnyc.edu/museum, closes tomorrow. (Smith) \n ARIC OBROSEY In these fastidious graphite drawings of woven and knotted threads, all the strands behave according to strict spatial and structural rules, even as they coalesce at the center into mandala-like circles or a wildly knotted disco ball. As they twist and turn they also evoke different cultures, materials and crafts. Care in making encourages care in looking. McKenzie Fine Art Inc., 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-5467, closes Wednesday. (Smith)\nJEFF PERRONE Mr. Perrone was a charter member of Pattern and Decoration, the 1970s movement that officially turned craft into art and elevated visual extravagance to a high place. Compared to the ornamental painting and fabric pieces he is best known for, though, the work in this show is Minimalist plain: 46 small earthenware plaques hung edge-to-edge in a row, each painted flat turquoise blue with modest yellow border designs and hand-printed texts, many of them bitingly topical. Silo, 1 Freeman Alley, off Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 505-9156, closes tomorrow. (Cotter)\n \u2605 \u2018POLITICAL CARTOONS FROM NIGERIA\u2019 Most of the drawn and painted images in this show are single-panel lampoons of past and present social inequity and governmental corruption in Nigeria. Nearly all are by Ghariokwu Lemi, who is famous for having painted 26 superb, incident-filled album covers for the Afrobeat idol and political rebel Fela Kuti. For the occasion, Mr. Ghariokwu also introduces two of his younger colleagues, Comfort Jacobs and Lordwealth Ololade, to New York. Without resembling him in style, they follow his sharp commentarial lead. Southfirst, 60 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-4884, closes Sunday. (Cotter)",

This ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas, sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu.

Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Glueck)\n \n QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018QUEENS INTERNATIONAL 2006: EVERYTHING ALL AT ONCE,\u2019 through Jan. 14. The 52 artists and two collaboratives in this exhibition are natives of various regions of North America, as well as of Bosnia, China, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Peru and Venezuela. The only common ground, perhaps, is that they all live in Queens. Instead of arranging the work according to medium, ethnicity or generalized themes, the curators follow the edict of the exhibition\u2019s subtitle. The show tries to balance the interests of the art crowd and local residents. Sometimes these concerns dovetail nicely, as in Sophia Peer\u2019s quick-cut video \u201cEveryday,\u201d which shows her aging parents moving around their cramped home in Queens like latter-day, empty-nest Bunkers. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, www.queensmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener) \n STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: \u2018AFRICA COMICS,\u2019 through March 18. Intense is the word for this modest-size first-time United States survey of designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense, the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. The entertainment value is high. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids, and the schlumpy but wily character named Goorgoolou from Senegal. But more often than not, humor is sugarcoating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. \n(Holland Cotter) \n WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: \u2018KIKI SMITH: A GATHERING, 1980-2005,\u2019 through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float here: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum\u2019s black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith\u2019s art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter)\n Galleries: Chelsea\n\u2605 ATELIER VAN LIESHOUT: SLAVECITY In this only partly satirical show, architectural scale models, drawings, sculpture, a map and an extensive business plan propose a highly efficient, completely self-sufficient city whose \u201cparticipants\u201d each have a desk job, a farm job and very little time off. The tyranny of it all is brought home in the second gallery, which contains the \u201cMidi Disciplinator,\u201d a cell built to accommodate 18 people working in shifts, filing logs into sawdust for no good reason. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, through Jan. 6. (Smith)\n \u2605 NOAH FISCHER, \u2018RHETORIC MACHINE\u2019 This young, Brooklyn-based artist has a winner of a first New York solo: a two-room, Rube-Goldbergesque kinetic environment set to a score of clips from doom-threatening speeches by United States presidents, ardent pop love songs and the baseline sound of jets and bombs. In sync with the soundtrack, low-tech, handmade light-projecting machines whir and jerk into life, turning the show into a combination of modernist ballet m\u00e9canique and gothic danse macabre. Technically ingenious and full of ideas, the show takes approximately 10 minutes to complete one sound-and-motion cycle. Oliver Kamm/5BE, 621 West 27th Street, (212) 255-0979, 5begallery.com, through Jan. 6. (Cotter)\n\n \n\u2605 CANDIDA HOFER In large color photographs of the different galleries of the Louvre, taken on Tuesdays when the museum is closed, both the long, vaulted spaces and the painting and sculpture they contain speak of different times and styles. Equally effecting, if not a little frightening, is the lavish, timeless grandeur of these vistas. A palace that became a museum, the Louvre is also a precursor of the barrel-vaulted arcades that sprang up in Paris in the first half of the 19th century. Most of them are gone, but the Louvre\u2019s arcades live on. Sort of. Sonnabend Gallery, 536 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-1018. (Smith)\n\n\u2605 CHEYNEY THOMPSON: \u2018QUELQUES ASPECTS DE L\u2019ART BOURGEOIS: LA NON-INTERVENTION\u2019 A teasing, tantalizing, subtly beautiful show by one of the sharper young artists of the moment explores the tensions between street and studio, skill and skepticism, painting and nonpainting and culture and commerce with seemingly abstract canvases, photographs framed by folding street-vendor tables and tinted off-set lithographs of the gallery\u2019s storage shelves. The title translates as \u201cCertain Aspects of Bourgeois Art: Non-Intervention.\u201d Andrew Kreps, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 741-8849, through Jan. 6. (Smith)\n \u2605 \u2018WHEN THE REVOLUTION COMES\u2019 The artist Michael St. John has brought some interesting people together in this scrappy, savory group show. It\u2019s great to revisit Nancy Grossman\u2019s leather-bound heads, looking as radical as they did 30 years ago, and Holt Quentel\u2019s distressed gray banners from the 1980s, out of view since but looking right, right now. Strong young artists like Nate Lowman, Joshua Weintraub and Josh White sustain growing reputations, and a bevy of less familiar figures \u2014 Jamal Cyrus, A. J. Bocchino, Alex McQuilkan and Ellwyn Palmerton \u2014 look good. Also in the gallery: a small solo of vivacious, minutely detailed drawings by Josedgardo Granados that bring pre-Columbian and post-Columbian worlds together in a cultural and psychic revolution still in progress. Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts, 508 West 26th Street, Suite 5A, (212) 463-8500, kathleencullenfinearts.com, through Jan. 6. (Cotter) \nOther Galleries\n \u2605 \u2018NOVEMBER\u2019  The Los Angeles- based curator Jeffrey Uslip put together this obliquely topical group show, which includes several young West Coast-based artists. In a Babel-ish moment in art, language, scrambled and obscured, is one of the themes here, with Kara Tanaka\u2019s listening-booth sculpture transmuting past conversations into a melancholic music. Landscape as poisoned terrain is another. Surrealism, art\u2019s 21st-century Esperanto, is the prevailing language. Harris Lieberman, 89 Vandam Street, between Greenwich and Hudson, South Village, (212) 206-1290, harrislieberman.com, through Jan. 6. (Cotter) \nLast Chance\n \u2605 \u2018AMERICAN MASTERWORKS FROM THE MUNSON-WILLIAMS-PROCTOR ARTS INSTITUTE\u2019 This Utica, N.Y., institution, celebrating its educational alliance with the Pratt Institute in New York City, is showing more than 75 paintings, drawings, sculptures and furniture pieces, from the 18th to the 20th centuries. A highlight is the original version of Thomas Cole\u2019s moving allegory \u201cThe Voyage of Life\u201d (1839-40), which in four monumental canvases compares the journey from childhood to old age to the winding course of a river. A smashing portrait of the Revolutionary War general Peter Gansevoort (about 1794), by Gilbert Stuart, is a distinguished entry from the earlier part of the show. Post-World War II paintings by Pollock and Rothko add to the buzz. Hirschl & Adler, 21 East 70th Street, (212) 535-8810, hirschlandadler.com; closes today. (Glueck)\n \u2605 ASIA SOCIETY: \u2018GILDED SPLENDOR: TREASURES OF CHINA\u2019S LIAO EMPIRE (907-1125)\u2019 The first major display of Liao objects outside China, this show gives the lie to the idea of the Khitan as cultural nobodies. Among the more exotic exhibits are those that reveal Khitan burial customs for royal personages: the corpse was first embalmed and then carefully wrapped in silk, and the adornments included a whole-body netting, a metal mask of gold or lesser material, a burial suit and an overcoat. The Khitan taste for jewelry, too, is evident in the elaborate, exquisitely worked examples on display. Ceramics, wood carvings, painted screens and belts and other personal objects; bronze mirrors that studded the outside of the White Pagoda; writing instruments, embroidered fabrics, miniature pagodas used as containers for Buddhist scriptures; and even an ancient spittoon add to the bite and flavor of this show. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org; closes on Sunday. (Glueck) \u2605 DAHESH MUSEUM OF ART: \u2018NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT\u2019 Napoleon\u2019s invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of \u201cDescription de l\u2019\u00c9gypte.\u201d Examples of the book\u2019s prints form the backbone of this engrossing if somewhat strange show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606, daheshmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith) \u2605 FRICK COLLECTION: \u2018CIMABUE AND EARLY ITALIAN DEVOTIONAL PAINTING\u2019 Weighing in at 6 works of art, with about 20 images among them, this is one of the most stupendous very small exhibitions most of us are likely to see. It reunites two small, beautiful, newly attributed panels by the Italian master Cimabue, whose turn toward naturalism increased the sense of space, gesture and feeling in Florentine painting, and helped set the Renaissance in motion. The panels, which depict a Virgin and Child Enthroned and a Flagellation and may be from the same altarpiece, are flanked by related works that highlight Cimabue\u2019s radicalness without letting it completely steal the show. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700; closes on Sunday. (Smith)\n MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: \u2018EYE ON EUROPE: PRINTS, BOOKS & MULTIPLES, 1960 TO NOW\u2019 This is a woolly, at times idiosyncratic assemblage of more than 350 prints and multiple editions by 118 European artists. Although they are still often considered secondary mediums, the show charts how prints and multiple editions rose to prominence in the 1960s as an essentially democratic strategy, having largely to do with accessibility and affordability, as artists explored alternatives to conventional painting and sculpture. Following this are displays of artwork by contemporary artists working in these mediums. (212) 708-9400, www.moma.org; closes on Monday. (Genocchio)\n NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: \u2018LUMINIST HORIZONS: THE ART AND COLLECTION OF JAMES A. SUYDAM, 1819-1865\u2019 This show is the first museum survey of the career of this 19th-century American painter and is accompanied by a weighty monograph. His early works were painted in a smooth Luminist style compatible with his material, pleasantly detached scenes of rural tranquillity or calm seas beneath hazy skies. His masterwork, \u201cParadise Rocks, Newport\u201d (1860), is an expansive, low-tide view of a wide, flat beach, meadow and distant rising rocks along the Rhode Island shoreline. The paintings in this show remind us that Mr. Suydam \u2014 and his fellow Luminists \u2014 were a talented group who helped bring a measure of sensitivity, subtlety and poetry to the American landscape tradition. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org; closes on Sunday. (Genocchio) PARRISH ART MUSEUM: \u2018ROY LICHTENSTEIN: AMERICAN INDIAN ENCOUNTERS\u2019 Lichtenstein is more popularly associated with his Pop paintings, often based on comic book images, than with the works here. But in the 1950s, using a somewhat Cubist style, he explored mythic characters like medieval knights or cowboys and Indians. \u201cChief Before Teepee,\u201d an abstract oil painting, and \u201cTwo Wild Indians,\u201d a drawing, both from 1952, were unearthed by the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation for the show\u2019s run at the Montclair Art Museum last year. Parrish Art Museum, 25 Job\u2019s Lane, Southampton, N.Y., (631) 283-2118, Ext. 32, parrishart.org; closes on Sunday. (Carol Vogel) \n \u2018REPLANTING THE COMMUNITY GARDEN\u2019 Organized by the artist Michael Tong, this show consists of two environmental pieces. William Meyer, a professional landscape designer, contributes an \u201cUrban Air Scrubber,\u201d a closet-size smoker\u2019s lounge filled with air-purifying plants. A wood construction by Adam Brent is made of shelves holding miniature plants; it\u2019s a model for real plant holders and shelters that might be built in tight urban spaces, an idea that makes particular sense at this venerable, financially vulnerable gallery in a neighborhood where grass-roots empty-lot gardens have long been a source of local pride. Tribes Gallery, 285 East Third Street, East Village, (212) 674-3778, www.tribes.org; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)\n WADSWORTH ATHENEUM: \u2018AMERICAN SPLENDOR: HUDSON RIVER SCHOOL MASTERWORKS FROM THE WADSWORTH ATHENEUM\u2019 Back from a two-and-a-half-year tour at six other American museums, the Wadsworth\u2019s formidable collection of 19th-century Hudson River School paintings is on display in this homecoming show. Not every Hudson River collection can boast 11 works by Frederic Edwin Church, 13 by Thomas Cole and 5 by Albert Bierstadt, a leading painter of the American West, along with powerful examples by other artists of the school. They are among the more than 60 paintings on display here. It\u2019s rare that you see these ultrafamiliar paintings in such concentration; their combined presence gives the show a synergistic sparkle and energy that you don\u2019t get when you see them in smaller groupings. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org; closes on Sunday. (Glueck)\n PAUL MCCARTHY: \u2018BETWEEN BEAUTY AND THE BEAST\u2019 Despite the scattershot nature of this show, mostly of work from around 1990 to 2004, Mr. McCarthy\u2019s signature moves and gestures are all here. His scatological side is represented by a selection of drawings featuring crude, sexualized doodles and misspelled messages, unpublishable here, that recall graffiti in public restrooms. In \u201cMasks\u201d (1994), the abject and uncanny are explored in a suite of large-scale color photographs of soiled silicon masks that mix fear with surprising pathos. His work also continues to reveal itself as a corrective, or perhaps an addendum, to more antiseptic strains of 1960s Pop. Rather than celebrating or criticizing popular images, Mr. McCarthy plays the role of analyst, musing on the creepy cheerfulness of cartoon characters and their incarnations as amusement park mascots. The seven bright-hued sculptures of \u201cDwarf Head\u201d (2000) borrow from Walt Disney\u2019s \u201cSnow White.\u201d Only here the dwarfs look decapitated and cryogenically preserved, their cuteness transformed into an eternal, chilling blankness. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy Park South, Suite 8D, (212) 955-1785, nyehaus.com; closes tomorrow. (Schwendener)",

    "text": "U.S. Muslim Clerics Seek a Modern Middle Ground\n2006-06-18T05:00:00.000Z\nEvery seat in the auditorium at the University of Houston was taken, and the crowd was standing in the back and spilling out into the lobby, straining to hear. The two men onstage began to speak to the crowd in Arabic, with such flawless accents and rarefied Koranic grammar that some audience members gaped when they heard the Arabic equivalent of the king's English coming from the mouths of two Americans.\nSheik Hamza Yusuf, in a groomed goatee and sports jacket, looked more like a hip white college professor than a Middle Eastern sheik. Imam Zaid Shakir, a lanky African-American in a long brown tunic, looked as if he would fit in just fine on the streets of Damascus.\nBoth men are converts to Islam who spent years in the Middle East and North Africa being mentored by formidable Muslim scholars. They have since become leading intellectual lights for a new generation of American Muslims looking for homegrown leaders who can help them learn how to live their faith without succumbing to American materialism or Islamic extremism.\n\"This is the wealthiest Muslim community on earth,\" Mr. Shakir told the crowd, quickly adding that \"the wealth here has been earned\" -- unlike, he said, in the oil-rich Middle East. As the audience laughed at Mr. Shakir's flattery, he chided them for buying Lexuses -- with heated leather seats they would never need in Houston -- and Jaguars, and made them laugh again by pronouncing it \"Jaguoooaah,\" like a stuffy Anglophile.\nAnd then he issued a challenge: \"Where are the Muslim Doctors Without Borders? Spend six months here, six months in the Congo. Form it!\"\nMost American mosques import their clerics from overseas -- some who preach extremism, some who cannot speak English, and most who cannot begin to speak to young American Muslims growing up on hip-hop and in mixed-sex chat rooms. Mr. Yusuf, 48, and Mr. Shakir, 50, are using their clout to create the first Islamic seminary in the United States, where they hope to train a new generation of imams and scholars who can reconcile Islam and American culture.\nThe seminary is still in its fledgling stages, but Mr. Yusuf and Mr. Shakir have gained a large following by being equally at home in Islamic tradition and modern American culture. Mr. Yusuf dazzles his audiences by weaving into one of his typical half-hour talks quotations from St. Augustine, Patton, Eric Erikson, Jung, Solzhenitsyn, Auden, Robert Bly, Gen. William C. Westmoreland and the Bible. He is the host of a TV reality show that is popular in the Middle East, in which he takes a vanload of Arabs on a road trip across the United States to visit people who might challenge Arab stereotypes about Americans, like the antiwar protesters demonstrating outside the Republican National Convention.\nMr. Shakir mixes passages from the Koran with a few lines of rap, and channels accents from ghetto to Valley Girl. Some of his students call him the next Malcolm X -- out of his earshot, because he so often preaches the importance of humility.\nBoth men draw overflow crowds in theaters, mosques and university auditoriums that seat thousands. Their books and CD's are pored over by young Muslims in study groups. As scholars and proselytizers of the faith, they have a much higher profile than most imams, as Muslim clerics who are usually in charge of mosques are known. Their message is that both Islam and America have gone seriously astray, and that American Muslims have a responsibility to harness their growing numbers and economic power to help set them straight.\nThey say that Islam must be rescued from extremists who selectively cite Islamic scripture to justify terrorism. Though Mr. Yusuf and Mr. Shakir do not denounce particular scholars or schools of thought, their students say the two are challenging the influence of Islam's more reactionary sects, like Wahhabism and Salafism, which has been spread to American mosques and schools by clerics trained in Saudi Arabia. Where Wahhabism and Salafism are often intolerant of other religions -- even of other streams within Islam -- Mr. Yusuf and Mr. Shakir teach that Islam is open to a diversity of interpretations honed by centuries of scholars.\nMr. Yusuf told the audience in Houston to beware of \"fanatics\" who pluck Islamic scripture out of context and say, \"We're going to tell you what God says on every single issue.\"\n\"That's not Islam,\" Mr. Yusuf said. \"That's psychopathy.\"\nHe asked the audience to pray for the victims of kidnappers in Iraq, saying that kidnapping is just as bad as American bombings in which the military dismisses the civilians killed as \"collateral damage.\"\n\"They're both sinister, as far as I'm concerned,\" he said. \"One is efficient, the other is pathetic.\"\nBoth Mr. Shakir and Mr. Yusuf have a history of anti-American rhetoric, but with age, they have tempered their views. Mr. Shakir told the Houston audience that they are blessed to live in a country that is stable and safe, and in which they have thrived.\nWhen it came time for questions, one young man stepped to the microphone and asked: \"You said we have an obligation to humanity. Did you mean to Muslims, or to everyone?\"\nMr. Shakir responded: \"The obligation is to everyone. All of the people are the dependents of Allah.\"\nWhen Mr. Shakir and Mr. Yusuf stepped off the stage, they were mobbed by a crowd that personified the breadth of their following. There were students in college sweatshirts, doctors and limousine drivers in suits. There were immigrants from Asia, the Middle East and Africa, and the grown children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the immigrant generation. There were plenty of African-Americans (as many as a third of American Muslims are black), and a sprinkling of white and Hispanic converts. There were women in all kinds of head scarves, and women without.\nMr. Yusuf and Mr. Shakir posed for pictures and signed their CD's, books and DVD's -- the two men combined have more than 80 items on the market. A young couple thanked Mr. Yusuf for his CD set on Muslim marriage, saying it had saved theirs. A family from Indonesia asked him to interpret a dream. An older woman from Iraq begged him to contact Muslim scholars in her homeland and correct their misguided teaching.\nAfter waiting for more than an hour to greet the scholars, Sohail Ansari, an information technology specialist originally from India, marveled, \"I was born a Muslim, and these guys are so far ahead of us.\"\nEncouraging Tolerance\nMr. Yusuf lives on a cul-de-sac in Danville, a Northern California suburb, in a house with a three-car garage. The living room is spread with Persian rugs; it is mostly bare of furniture. He held a dinner with guests in traditional Arab style -- on the floor, while the smallest of his five sons curled up in the rugs and fell asleep. His wife, Liliana, tired from a day of home-schooling and driving the boys to karate lessons, passed around take-out curry. She converted to Islam after meeting Mr. Yusuf in college, to the chagrin of her Catholic Hispanic parents. The couple married outdoors, in a redwood grove.\nMr. Yusuf received the Arabic title of sheik from his teachers in Mauritania, in West Africa. There the honorific is usually given to old men with a deep knowledge of Islam who serve their communities as wise oracles, but Mr. Yusuf was only 28. His given name was Mark Hanson, and he was raised Greek Orthodox in a bohemian but affluent part of Marin County, just north of San Francisco.\nHe converted to Islam after a near-fatal car accident in high school sent him on an existential journey. He said that the simplicity of \"no God but Allah\" made far more sense to him than the Trinity, and he found the five daily prayers a constant call to awe about everything from the sun to his capillaries.\nThe American seminary was Mr. Yusuf's idea. His diagnosis of the problem with Islam today is that its followers lack \"religious knowledge.\" Islam, like Judaism, is based in scripture and law that has been interpreted, reinterpreted and debated for centuries by scholars who inspired four schools of Islamic jurisprudence. Mr. Yusuf laments that many of the seminaries that once flourished in the Muslim world are now either gone or intellectually dead. Now, he said, the sharpest Muslim students go into technical fields like engineering, not religion.\nHe said he believed that if more Muslims were schooled in their faith's diverse intellectual streams and had a holistic understanding of their religion, they would not be so susceptible to the Osama bin Ladens who tell them that suicide bombers are martyrs.\n\"Where you don't have people who have strong intellectual capacity, you get demagoguery,\" he said.\nMr. Yusuf once was a source of the kind of zealous rhetoric he now denounces. He said in 1995 that Judaism was based on the belief that \"God has this bias to this small little tribe in the middle of the desert,\" which makes it \"a most racist religion.\" On Sept. 9, 2001, he said the United States \"stands condemned\" for invading Muslim lands.\nHe has since changed his tune -- not for spin, he says, but on principle. \"Our community has failed, and I include myself in that,\" he told an audience in a downtown theater in Elizabeth, N.J., this year. \"When I started speaking in the early 90's, our discourse was not balanced.\n\"We were focused so often on what was negative about this country,\" he said. \"We ended up alienating some people. I've said some things about other religions that I regret now. I think they were incorrect.\"\nHe added: \"A tree grows. If you're staying the same, something is wrong. You're not alive.\"\nAn Enthusiastic Following\nMr. Yusuf named his school the Zaytuna Institute -- Arabic for olive tree, and also the name of a renowned Islamic university in Tunisia. The site, adjacent to a busy boulevard in Hayward, Calif., is an unlikely oasis, the air scented by jasmine bushes and flowering vines.\nFive times a day, starting around 5 a.m., a teacher or a student stands outside the prayer hall and warbles the call to prayer. In the mornings, few respond, but by evening, the hall is filled with the rustling of men and women dropping to their knees, divided by a wooden screen.\nThe prayer hall was once a church. There is also a yurt and a high backboard used as a target for archery, because the Prophet Muhammad recommended it as an athletic activity. (The backboard will soon come down to avoid alarming neighbors who might balk at seeing Muslims with bows and arrows).\nOn a sunny day, one student, Ousmane Bah, sat outside the yurt, washing the ink off a polished wooden slate on which he had written his lesson for the past week, which he had committed to memory. The lesson, written in Arabic poetry, was about what makes a fair trade. Near the yurt, BART trains sped by.\n\"The United States is the capital of modernity,\" Mr. Bah said, \"and you have this very traditional Islam, which is 1,400 years old, being taught in this modern world.\"\nMany American universities have Islamic studies departments, and a program at Hartford Seminary accredits Muslim chaplains. But there is no program in the United States like Zaytuna.\nHundreds of Muslims come to Zaytuna for evening and weekend classes on the Prophet Muhammad, the Koran and the Arabic language. The institute's full-time seminary program is in the pilot phase, with only six students. It is expected to double its enrollment next fall.\nBesides Mr. Bah, there are two women -- one a former software engineer, the other a former prenatal genetic counselor -- and three men -- a former jazz musician from Maryland, a motorcycle mechanic from Atlanta and a son of Bangladeshi immigrants in New York City who chose Zaytuna over the Ivy League.\n\"Sheik Hamza and Imam Zaid have grown up here after having studied abroad, and you can really connect with them,\" said the New Yorker, Ebadur Rahman, who is 19. \"The scholars who come from abroad, they can't connect with the people. They're ignorant of life here.\"\nIslamic studies experts say that what Mr. Yusuf and Mr. Shakir are teaching is traditional orthodox Islam, and that it is impossible to characterize their theology as either conservative or liberal. They encourage but do not require women in class to cover their heads. They have hired a female scholar, who teaches only women. Last year, Mr. Shakir published a rebuttal to a group of progressive American Muslims who argue that Islamic law allows women to lead men in prayer.\nMr. Yusuf says he has become too busy to teach regularly at his own school. He writes books, translates Arabic poetry, records CD's, tapes his television show. He meets with rabbis, ministers and the Dalai Lama, and travels annually to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\nMr. Yusuf's fame grew after he was invited to the White House nine days after the Sept. 11 attacks, making him the only Muslim leader along with five other religious leaders who were called to meet with President Bush. He suggested that Mr. Bush change the name of the military's impending operation in Afghanistan, \"Infinite Justice,\" because it would offend Muslims, who believe the only source of infinite justice is God. Mr. Bush responded by changing the operation's name to \"Operation Enduring Freedom,\" and in the news media Mr. Yusuf gained a title other than sheik: \"adviser to the president.\"\nMr. Yusuf, however, said that Mr. Bush since then \"hasn't taken any of my advice.\"\nPersuasion Over Violence\nThree years ago, Mr. Yusuf invited Mr. Shakir to teach at Zaytuna as a scholar in residence. Mr. Shakir had recently returned from his second stint of studying Islam abroad -- a total of seven years in Syria and Morocco.\nOne recent Sunday afternoon, Mr. Shakir had 50 students in his Zaytuna class on marriage and family. The women brought their babies and their knitting, and everyone munched on homemade cookies brought for a cookie-baking contest.\n\"It's going to be hard to beat this oatmeal raisin,\" Mr. Shakir said between swigs of organic milk.\nThe real topic at hand was whether polygamy, which is permitted in Islam, is appropriate in the modern context. Mr. Shakir mediated a heated debate between the men and women who sparred across the wooden divider that separated them.\nOne man said that having more than one wife was good because some women are so \"career orientated\" that \"they don't want to be cleaning up all the time behind the man.\" At that, one woman shouted out, \"Get a maid!\" and everyone dissolved in laughter.\nMr. Shakir told the students that Islam allows polygamy because it was a \"practical\" and \"compassionate\" solution in some cases, as when women are widowed in war. But in the modern context, he said, \"a lot of harm ensues.\"\nMr. Shakir said afterward that he still had trouble believing how a boy from the projects could have become an Islamic scholar with students who are willing to move across the country to study with him.\nHe and his wife, Saliha, became Muslims in the Air Force. He had joined the military as a teenager in the lull after Vietnam because his mother had died and he had no means. His name was Ricky Mitchell, and his mother had raised him and his siblings in housing projects in Georgia -- where he remembers going to his grandparents' farm and picking cotton -- and in New Britain, Conn.\nA Goal for America\nWhile leading a mosque in New Haven in 1992, Mr. Shakir wrote a pamphlet that cautioned Muslims not to be co-opted by American politics. He wrote, \"Islam presents an absolutist political agenda, or one which doesn't lend itself to compromise, nor to coalition building.\"\nWhile he did not denounce Muslims who take part in politics, he pointed out the effectiveness of \"extrasystemic political action\" -- like the \"armed struggle\" that brought about the rule of the Taliban in Afghanistan. A copy of the pamphlet was found in the apartment of a suspect in the first World Trade Center bombing, in 1993. Mr. Shakir says he was questioned by the F.B.I., but had no link to the man, and that was the end of it.\nWhile studying in Syria a few years later, he visited Hama, a city that had tried to revolt against the Syrian ruler, Hafez al-Assad. Mr. Shakir said he saw mass graves and bulldozed neighborhoods, and talked with widows of those killed. He gave up on the idea of armed struggle, he said, \"just seeing the reality of where revolution can end.\"\nAsked now about his past, he said, \"To be perfectly honest, I don't regret anything I've done or said.\"\nHe added, \"I had to go through that stage to become the person that I am, and I'm not willing to negate my past.\"\nHe said he still hoped that one day the United States would be a Muslim country ruled by Islamic law, \"not by violent means, but by persuasion.\"\n\"Every Muslim who is honest would say, I would like to see America become a Muslim country,\" he said. \"I think it would help people, and if I didn't believe that, I wouldn't be a Muslim. Because Islam helped me as a person, and it's helped a lot of people in my community.\"",

    "text": "U.S. Muslim clerics seek a modern middle ground - Americas - International Herald Tribune\n2006-06-18T05:00:00.000Z\nEvery seat in the auditorium at the University of Houston was taken, and the crowd was standing in the back and spilling out into the lobby, straining to hear. The two men onstage began to speak to the crowd in Arabic, with such flawless accents and rarefied Koranic grammar that some audience members gaped when they heard the Arabic equivalent of the king's English coming from the mouths of two Americans.\nSheik Hamza Yusuf, in a groomed goatee and sports jacket, looked more like a hip white college professor than a Middle Eastern sheik. Imam Zaid Shakir, a lanky African-American in a long brown tunic, looked as if he would fit in just fine on the streets of Damascus.\nBoth men are converts to Islam who spent years in the Middle East and North Africa being mentored by formidable Muslim scholars. They have since become leading intellectual lights for a new generation of American Muslims looking for homegrown leaders who can help them learn how to live their faith without succumbing to American materialism or Islamic extremism.\n\"This is the wealthiest Muslim community on earth,\" Shakir told the crowd, quickly adding that \"the wealth here has been earned\" - unlike, he said, in the oil-rich Middle East. As the audience laughed at Shakir's flattery, he chided them for buying Lexuses - with heated leather seats they would never need in Houston - and Jaguars, and made them laugh again by pronouncing it \"Jaguoooaah,\" like a stuffy Anglophile.\nAnd then he issued a challenge: \"Where are the Muslim Doctors Without Borders? Spend six months here, six months in the Congo. Form it!\"\nMost American mosques import their clerics from overseas - some who preach extremism, some who cannot speak English, and most who cannot begin to speak to young American Muslims growing up on hip-hop and in mixed-sex chat rooms.\nYusuf, 48, and Shakir, 50, are using their clout to create the first Islamic seminary in the United States, where they hope to train a new generation of imams and scholars who can reconcile Islam and American culture.\nThe seminary is still in its fledgling stages, but Yusuf and Shakir have gained a large following by being equally at home in Islamic tradition and modern American culture. Yusuf dazzles his audiences by weaving into one of his typical half-hour talks quotations from St. Augustine, Patton, Eric Erikson, Jung, Solzhenitsyn, Auden, Robert Bly, Gen. William C. Westmoreland and the Bible. He is the host of a TV reality show that is popular in the Middle East, in which he takes a vanload of Arabs on a road trip across the United States to visit people who might challenge Arab stereotypes about Americans, like the antiwar protesters demonstrating outside the Republican National Convention.\nShakir mixes passages from the Koran with a few lines of rap, and channels accents from ghetto to Valley Girl. Some of his students call him the next Malcolm X - out of his earshot, because he so often preaches the importance of humility.\nBoth men draw overflow crowds in theaters, mosques and university auditoriums that seat thousands. Their books and CD's are pored over by young Muslims in study groups. As scholars and proselytizers of the faith, they have a much higher profile than most imams, as Muslim clerics who are usually in charge of mosques are known. Their message is that both Islam and America have gone seriously astray, and that American Muslims have a responsibility to harness their growing numbers and economic power to help set them straight.\nThey say that Islam must be rescued from extremists who selectively cite Islamic scripture to justify terrorism. Though Yusuf and Shakir do not denounce particular scholars or schools of thought, their students say the two are challenging the influence of Islam's more reactionary sects, like Wahhabism and Salafism, which has been spread to American mosques and schools by clerics trained in Saudi Arabia. Where Wahhabism and Salafism are often intolerant of other religions - even of other streams within Islam - Yusuf and Shakir teach that Islam is open to a diversity of interpretations honed by centuries of scholars.\nYusuf told the audience in Houston to beware of \"fanatics\" who pluck Islamic scripture out of context and say, \"We're going to tell you what God says on every single issue.\"\n\"That's not Islam,\" Yusuf said. \"That's psychopathy.\"\nHe asked the audience to pray for the victims of kidnappers in Iraq, saying that kidnapping is just as bad as American bombings in which the military dismisses the civilians killed as \"collateral damage.\"\n\"They're both sinister, as far as I'm concerned,\" he said. \"One is efficient, the other is pathetic.\"\nBoth Shakir and Yusuf have a history of anti-American rhetoric, but with age, they have tempered their views. Shakir told the Houston audience that they are blessed to live in a country that is stable and safe, and in which they have thrived.\nWhen it came time for questions, one young man stepped to the microphone and asked: \"You said we have an obligation to humanity. Did you mean to Muslims, or to everyone?\"\nShakir responded: \"The obligation is to everyone. All of the people are the dependents of Allah.\"\nWhen Shakir and Yusuf stepped off the stage, they were mobbed by a crowd that personified the breadth of their following. There were students in college sweatshirts, doctors and limousine drivers in suits. There were immigrants from Asia, the Middle East and Africa, and the grown children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the immigrant generation. There were plenty of African-Americans (as many as a third of American Muslims are black), and a sprinkling of white and Hispanic converts. There were women in all kinds of head scarves, and women without.\nYusuf and Shakir posed for pictures and signed their CD's, books and DVD's - the two men combined have more than 80 items on the market. A young couple thanked Yusuf for his CD set on Muslim marriage, saying it had saved theirs. A family from Indonesia asked him to interpret a dream. An older woman from Iraq begged him to contact Muslim scholars in her homeland and correct their misguided teaching.\nAfter waiting for more than an hour to greet the scholars, Sohail Ansari, an information technology specialist originally from India, marveled, \"I was born a Muslim, and these guys are so far ahead of us.\"\n<b>Encouraging Tolerance</B>\nYusuf lives on a cul-de-sac in Danville, a Northern California suburb, in a house with a three-car garage. The living room is spread with Persian rugs; it is mostly bare of furniture. He held a dinner with guests in traditional Arab style - on the floor, while the smallest of his five sons curled up in the rugs and fell asleep. His wife, Liliana, tired from a day of home-schooling and driving the boys to karate lessons, passed around take-out curry. She converted to Islam after meeting Yusuf in college, to the chagrin of her Catholic Hispanic parents. The couple married outdoors, in a redwood grove.\n\n\nYusuf received the Arabic title of sheik from his teachers in Mauritania, in West Africa. There the honorific is usually given to old men with a deep knowledge of Islam who serve their communities as wise oracles, but Yusuf was only 28. His given name was Mark Hanson, and he was raised Greek Orthodox in a bohemian but affluent part of Marin County, just north of San Francisco.\nHe converted to Islam after a near-fatal car accident in high school sent him on an existential journey. He said that the simplicity of \"no God but Allah\" made far more sense to him than the Trinity, and he found the five daily prayers a constant call to awe about everything from the sun to his capillaries.\nThe American seminary was Yusuf's idea. His diagnosis of the problem with Islam today is that its followers lack \"religious knowledge.\" Islam, like Judaism, is based in scripture and law that has been interpreted, reinterpreted and debated for centuries by scholars who inspired four schools of Islamic jurisprudence.\nYusuf laments that many of the seminaries that once flourished in the Muslim world are now either gone or intellectually dead. Now, he said, the sharpest Muslim students go into technical fields like engineering, not religion.\nHe said he believed that if more Muslims were schooled in their faith's diverse intellectual streams and had a holistic understanding of their religion, they would not be so susceptible to the Osama bin Ladens who tell them that suicide bombers are martyrs.\n\"Where you don't have people who have strong intellectual capacity, you get demagoguery,\" he said.\nYusuf once was a source of the kind of zealous rhetoric he now denounces. He said in 1995 that Judaism was based on the belief that \"God has this bias to this small little tribe in the middle of the desert,\" which makes it \"a most racist religion.\" On Sept. 9, 2001, he said the United States \"stands condemned\" for invading Muslim lands.\nHe has since changed his tune - not for spin, he says, but on principle. \"Our community has failed, and I include myself in that,\" he told an audience in a downtown theater in Elizabeth, N.J., this year. \"When I started speaking in the early 90's, our discourse was not balanced.\n\"We were focused so often on what was negative about this country,\" he said. \"We ended up alienating some people. I've said some things about other religions that I regret now. I think they were incorrect.\"\nHe added: \"A tree grows. If you're staying the same, something is wrong. You're not alive.\"\n<b>An Enthusiastic Following</b>\nYusuf named his school the Zaytuna Institute - Arabic for olive tree, and also the name of a renowned Islamic university in Tunisia. The site, adjacent to a busy boulevard in Hayward, Calif., is an unlikely oasis, the air scented by jasmine bushes and flowering vines.\nFive times a day, starting around 5 a.m., a teacher or a student stands outside the prayer hall and warbles the call to prayer. In the mornings, few respond, but by evening, the hall is filled with the rustling of men and women dropping to their knees, divided by a wooden screen.\nThe prayer hall was once a church. There is also a yurt and a high backboard used as a target for archery, because the Prophet Muhammad recommended it as an athletic activity. (The backboard will soon come down to avoid alarming neighbors who might balk at seeing Muslims with bows and arrows).\nOn a sunny day, one student, Ousmane Bah, sat outside the yurt, washing the ink off a polished wooden slate on which he had written his lesson for the past week, which he had committed to memory. The lesson, written in Arabic poetry, was about what makes a fair trade. Near the yurt, BART trains sped by.\n\"The United States is the capital of modernity,\" Bah said, \"and you have this very traditional Islam, which is 1,400 years old, being taught in this modern world.\"\nMany American universities have Islamic studies departments, and a program at Hartford Seminary accredits Muslim chaplains. But there is no program in the United States like Zaytuna.\nHundreds of Muslims come to Zaytuna for evening and weekend classes on the Prophet Muhammad, the Koran and the Arabic language. The institute's full-time seminary program is in the pilot phase, with only six students. It is expected to double its enrollment next fall.\nBesides Bah, there are two women - one a former software engineer, the other a former prenatal genetic counselor - and three men - a former jazz musician from Maryland, a motorcycle mechanic from Atlanta and a son of Bangladeshi immigrants in New York City who chose Zaytuna over the Ivy League.\n\"Sheik Hamza and Imam Zaid have grown up here after having studied abroad, and you can really connect with them,\" said the New Yorker, Ebadur Rahman, who is 19. \"The scholars who come from abroad, they can't connect with the people. They're ignorant of life here.\"\nIslamic studies experts say that what Yusuf and Shakir are teaching is traditional orthodox Islam, and that it is impossible to characterize their theology as either conservative or liberal. They encourage but do not require women in class to cover their heads. They have hired a female scholar, who teaches only women. Last year, Shakir published a rebuttal to a group of progressive American Muslims who argue that Islamic law allows women to lead men in prayer.\nYusuf says he has become too busy to teach regularly at his own school. He writes books, translates Arabic poetry, records CD's, tapes his television show. He meets with rabbis, ministers and the Dalai Lama, and travels annually to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\nYusuf's fame grew after he was invited to the White House nine days after the Sept. 11 attacks, making him the only Muslim leader along with five other religious leaders who were called to meet with President Bush. He suggested that Bush change the name of the military's impending operation in Afghanistan, \"Infinite Justice,\" because it would offend Muslims, who believe the only source of infinite justice is God. Bush responded by changing the operation's name to \"Operation Enduring Freedom,\" and in the news media Yusuf gained a title other than sheik: \"adviser to the president.\"\nYusuf, however, said that Bush since then \"hasn't taken any of my advice.\" Persuasion Over Violence\nThree years ago, Yusuf invited Shakir to teach at Zaytuna as a scholar in residence. Shakir had recently returned from his second stint of studying Islam abroad - a total of seven years in Syria and Morocco.\nOne recent Sunday afternoon, Shakir had 50 students in his Zaytuna class on marriage and family. The women brought their babies and their knitting, and everyone munched on homemade cookies brought for a cookie-baking contest. \"It's going to be hard to beat this oatmeal raisin,\" Shakir said between swigs of organic milk.\nThe real topic at hand was whether polygamy, which is permitted in Islam, is appropriate in the modern context. Shakir mediated a heated debate between the men and women who sparred across the wooden divider that separated them. One man said that having more than one wife was good because some women are so \"career orientated\" that \"they don't want to be cleaning up all the time behind the man.\" At that, one woman shouted out, \"Get a maid!\" and everyone dissolved in laughter.\nShakir told the students that Islam allows polygamy because it was a \"practical\" and \"compassionate\" solution in some cases, as when women are widowed in war. But in the modern context, he said, \"a lot of harm ensues.\" Shakir said afterward that he still had trouble believing how a boy from the projects could have become an Islamic scholar with students who are willing to move across the country to study with him.\nHe and his wife, Saliha, became Muslims in the Air Force. He had joined the military as a teenager in the lull after Vietnam because his mother had died and he had no means. His name was Ricky Mitchell, and his mother had raised him and his siblings in housing projects in Georgia - where he remembers going to his grandparents' farm and picking cotton - and in New Britain, Conn.\n<b>A Goal for America</b>\nWhile leading a mosque in New Haven in 1992, Shakir wrote a pamphlet that cautioned Muslims not to be co-opted by American politics. He wrote, \"Islam presents an absolutist political agenda, or one which doesn't lend itself to compromise, nor to coalition building.\"\nWhile he did not denounce Muslims who take part in politics, he pointed out the effectiveness of \"extrasystemic political action\" - like the \"armed struggle\" that brought about the rule of the Taliban in Afghanistan. A copy of the pamphlet was found in the apartment of a suspect in the first World Trade Center bombing, in 1993. Shakir says he was questioned by the F.B.I., but had no link to the man, and that was the end of it.\nWhile studying in Syria a few years later, he visited Hama, a city that had tried to revolt against the Syrian ruler, Hafez al-Assad. Shakir said he saw mass graves and bulldozed neighborhoods, and talked with widows of those killed. He gave up on the idea of armed struggle, he said, \"just seeing the reality of where revolution can end.\"\nAsked now about his past, he said, \"To be perfectly honest, I don't regret anything I've done or said.\"\nHe added, \"I had to go through that stage to become the person that I am, and I'm not willing to negate my past.\"\nHe said he still hoped that one day the United States would be a Muslim country ruled by Islamic law, \"not by violent means, but by persuasion.\"\n\"Every Muslim who is honest would say, I would like to see America become a Muslim country,\" he said. \"I think it would help people, and if I didn't believe that, I wouldn't be a Muslim.

    "text": "An Elephant Crackup?\n2006-10-08T04:00:00.000Z\n\"We\u2019re not going anywhere,\u2019\u2019 my driver, Nelson Okello, whispered to me one morning this past June, the two of us sitting in the front seat of a jeep just after dawn in Queen Elizabeth National Park in southwestern Uganda. We\u2019d originally stopped to observe what appeared to be a lone bull elephant grazing in a patch of tall savanna grasses off to our left. More than one \u2018\u2018rogue\u2019\u2019 had crossed our path that morning \u2014 a young male elephant that has made an overly strong power play against the dominant male of his herd and been banished, sometimes permanently. This elephant, however, soon proved to be not a rogue but part of a cast of at least 30. The ground vibrations registered just before the emergence of the herd from the surrounding trees and brush. We sat there watching the elephants cross the road before us, seeming, for all their heft, so light on their feet, soundlessly plying the wind-swept savanna grasses like land whales adrift above the floor of an ancient, waterless sea. \nThen, from behind a thicket of acacia trees directly off our front left bumper, a huge female emerged \u2014 \u2018\u2018the matriarch,\u2019\u2019 Okello said softly. There was a small calf beneath her, freely foraging and knocking about within the secure cribbing of four massive legs. Acacia leaves are an elephant\u2019s favorite food, and as the calf set to work on some low branches, the matriarch stood guard, her vast back flank blocking the road, the rest of the herd milling about in the brush a short distance away. \nAfter 15 minutes or so, Okello started inching the jeep forward, revving the engine, trying to make us sound as beastly as possible. The matriarch, however, was having none of it, holding her ground, the fierce white of her eyes as bright as that of her tusks. Although I pretty much knew the answer, I asked Okello if he was considering trying to drive around. \u2018\u2018No,\u2019\u2019 he said, raising an index finger for emphasis. \u2018\u2018She\u2019ll charge. We should stay right here.\u2019\u2019 \nI\u2019d have considered it a wise policy even at a more peaceable juncture in the course of human-elephant relations. In recent years, however, those relations have become markedly more bellicose. Just two days before I arrived, a woman was killed by an elephant in Kazinga, a fishing village nearby. Two months earlier, a man was fatally gored by a young male elephant at the northern edge of the park, near the village of Katwe. African elephants use their long tusks to forage through dense jungle brush. They\u2019ve also been known to wield them, however, with the ceremonious flash and precision of gladiators, pinning down a victim with one knee in order to deliver the decisive thrust. Okello told me that a young Indian tourist was killed in this fashion two years ago in Murchison Falls National Park, north of where we were. \nThese were not isolated incidents. All across Africa, India and parts of Southeast Asia, from within and around whatever patches and corridors of their natural habitat remain, elephants have been striking out, destroying villages and crops, attacking and killing human beings. In fact, these attacks have become so commonplace that a new statistical category, known as Human-Elephant Conflict, or H.E.C., was created by elephant researchers in the mid-1990\u2019s to monitor the problem. In the Indian state of Jharkhand near the western border of Bangladesh, 300 people were killed by elephants between 2000 and 2004. In the past 12 years, elephants have killed 605 people in Assam, a state in northeastern India, 239 of them since 2001; 265 elephants have died in that same period, the majority of them as a result of retaliation by angry villagers, who have used everything from poison-tipped arrows to laced food to exact their revenge. In Africa, reports of human-elephant conflicts appear almost daily, from Zambia to Tanzania, from Uganda to Sierra Leone, where 300 villagers evacuated their homes last year because of unprovoked elephant attacks. \nStill, it is not only the increasing number of these incidents that is causing alarm but also the singular perversity \u2014 for want of a less anthropocentric term \u2014 of recent elephant aggression. Since the early 1990\u2019s, for example, young male elephants in Pilanesberg National Park and the Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Game Reserve in South Africa have been raping and killing rhinoceroses; this abnormal behavior, according to a 2001 study in the journal Pachyderm, has been reported in \u2018\u2018a number of reserves\u2019\u2019 in the region. In July of last year, officials in Pilanesberg shot three young male elephants who were responsible for the killings of 63 rhinos, as well as attacks on people in safari vehicles. In Addo Elephant National Park, also in South Africa, up to 90 percent of male elephant deaths are now attributable to other male elephants, compared with a rate of 6 percent in more stable elephant communities. \nIn a coming book on this phenomenon, Gay Bradshaw, a psychologist at the environmental-sciences program at Oregon State University, notes that in India, where the elephant has long been regarded as a deity, a recent headline in a leading newspaper warned, \u2018\u2018To Avoid Confrontation, Don\u2019t Worship Elephants.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Everybody pretty much agrees that the relationship between elephants and people has dramatically changed,\u2019\u2019 Bradshaw told me recently. \u2018\u2018What we are seeing today is extraordinary. Where for centuries humans and elephants lived in relatively peaceful coexistence, there is now hostility and violence. Now, I use the term \u2018violence\u2019 because of the intentionality associated with it, both in the aggression of humans and, at times, the recently observed behavior of elephants.\u2019\u2019 \nFor a number of biologists and ethologists who have spent their careers studying elephant behavior, the attacks have become so abnormal in both number and kind that they can no longer be attributed entirely to the customary factors. Typically, elephant researchers have cited, as a cause of aggression, the high levels of testosterone in newly matured male elephants or the competition for land and resources between elephants and humans. But in \u2018\u2018Elephant Breakdown,\u2019\u2019 a 2005 essay in the journal Nature, Bradshaw and several colleagues argued that today\u2019s elephant populations are suffering from a form of chronic stress, a kind of species-wide trauma. Decades of poaching and culling and habitat loss, they claim, have so disrupted the intricate web of familial and societal relations by which young elephants have traditionally been raised in the wild, and by which established elephant herds are governed, that what we are now witnessing is nothing less than a precipitous collapse of elephant culture. \nIt has long been apparent that every large, land-based animal on this planet is ultimately fighting a losing battle with humankind. And yet entirely befitting of an animal with such a highly developed sensibility, a deep-rooted sense of family and, yes, such a good long-term memory, the elephant is not going out quietly. It is not leaving without making some kind of statement, one to which scientists from a variety of disciplines, including human psychology, are now beginning to pay close attention. \nOnce the matriarch and her calf were a comfortable distance from us that morning, Okello and I made the 20-minute drive to Kyambura, a village at the far southeastern edge of the park. Back in 2003, Kyambura was reportedly the site of the very sort of sudden, unprovoked elephant attack I\u2019d been hearing about. According to an account of the event in the magazine New Scientist, a number of huts and fields were trampled, and the townspeople were afraid to venture out to surrounding villages, either by foot or on their bikes, because elephants were regularly blocking the road and charging out at those who tried to pass. \nPark officials from the Uganda Wildlife Authority with whom I tried to discuss the incident were reluctant to talk about it or any of the recent killings by elephants in the area. Eco-tourism is one of Uganda\u2019s major sources of income, and the elephant and other wildlife stocks of Queen Elizabeth National Park are only just now beginning to recover from years of virtually unchecked poaching and habitat destruction. Tom Okello, the chief game warden at the park (and no relation to my driver), and Margaret Driciru, Queen Elizabeth\u2019s chief veterinarian, each told me that they weren\u2019t aware of the attack in Kyambura. When I mentioned it to the executive director of the wildlife authority, Moses Mapesa, upon my initial arrival in the capital city, Kampala, he eventually admitted that it did happen, but he claimed that it was not nearly as recent as reported. \u2018\u2018That was 14 years ago,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018We have seen aggressive behavior from elephants, but that\u2019s a story of the past.\u2019\u2019 \nKyambura did look, upon our arrival, much like every other small Ugandan farming community I\u2019d passed through on my visit. Lush fields of banana trees, millet and maize framed a small town center of pastel-colored single-story cement buildings with corrugated-tin roofs. People sat on stoops out front in the available shade. Bicyclers bore preposterously outsize loads of bananas, firewood and five-gallon water jugs on their fenders and handlebars. Contrary to what I had read, the bicycle traffic along the road in and out of Kyambura didn\u2019t seem impaired in the slightest. \nBut when Okello and I asked a shopkeeper named Ibrah Byamukama about elephant attacks, he immediately nodded and pointed to a patch of maize and millet fields just up the road, along the edges of the surrounding Maramagambo Forest. He confirmed that a small group of elephants charged out one morning two years earlier, trampled the fields and nearby gardens, knocked down a few huts and then left. He then pointed to a long orange gash in the earth between the planted fields and the forest: a 15-foot-deep, 25-foot-wide trench that had been dug by the wildlife authority around the perimeter of Kyambura in an attempt to keep the elephants at bay. On the way out of town, Okello and I took a closer look at the trench. It was filled with stacks of thorny shrubs for good measure. \n \u2018\u2018The people are still worried,\u2019\u2019 Byamukama said, shaking his head. \u2018\u2018The elephants are just becoming more destructive. I don\u2019t know why.\u2019\u2019 \nThree years ago, Gay Bradshaw, then working on her graduate degree in psychology at Pacifica Graduate Institute outside Santa Barbara, Calif., began wondering much the same thing: was the extraordinary behavior of elephants in Africa and Asia signaling a breaking point? With the assistance of several established African-elephant researchers, including Daphne Sheldrick and Cynthia Moss, and with the help of Allan Schore, an expert on human trauma disorders at the department of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at U.C.L.A., Bradshaw sought to combine traditional research into elephant behavior with insights about trauma drawn from human neuroscience. Using the few remaining relatively stable elephant herds in places like Amboseli National Park in Kenya as control groups, Bradshaw and her colleagues analyzed the far more fractious populations found in places like Pilanesberg in South Africa and Queen Elizabeth National Park in Uganda. What emerged was a portrait of pervasive pachyderm dysfunction. \nElephants, when left to their own devices, are profoundly social creatures. A herd of them is, in essence, one incomprehensibly massive elephant: a somewhat loosely bound and yet intricately interconnected, tensile organism. Young elephants are raised within an extended, multitiered network of doting female caregivers that includes the birth mother, grandmothers, aunts and friends. These relations are maintained over a life span as long as 70 years. Studies of established herds have shown that young elephants stay within 15 feet of their mothers for nearly all of their first eight years of life, after which young females are socialized into the matriarchal network, while young males go off for a time into an all-male social group before coming back into the fold as mature adults. \nWhen an elephant dies, its family members engage in intense mourning and burial rituals, conducting weeklong vigils over the body, carefully covering it with earth and brush, revisiting the bones for years afterward, caressing the bones with their trunks, often taking turns rubbing their trunks along the teeth of a skull\u2019s lower jaw, the way living elephants do in greeting. If harm comes to a member of an elephant group, all the other elephants are aware of it. This sense of cohesion is further enforced by the elaborate communication system that elephants use. In close proximity they employ a range of vocalizations, from low-frequency rumbles to higher-pitched screams and trumpets, along with a variety of visual signals, from the waving of their trunks to subtle anglings of the head, body, feet and tail. When communicating over long distances \u2014 in order to pass along, for example, news about imminent threats, a sudden change of plans or, of the utmost importance to elephants, the death of a community member \u2014 they use patterns of subsonic vibrations that are felt as far as several miles away by exquisitely tuned sensors in the padding of their feet. \nThis fabric of elephant society, Bradshaw and her colleagues concluded, had effectively been frayed by years of habitat loss and poaching, along with systematic culling by government agencies to control elephant numbers and translocations of herds to different habitats. The number of older matriarchs and female caregivers (or \u2018\u2018allomothers\u2019\u2019) had drastically fallen, as had the number of elder bulls, who play a significant role in keeping younger males in line. In parts of Zambia and Tanzania, a number of the elephant groups studied contained no adult females whatsoever. In Uganda, herds were often found to be \u2018\u2018semipermanent aggregations,\u2019\u2019 as a paper written by Bradshaw describes them, with many females between the ages of 15 and 25 having no familial associations. \nAs a result of such social upheaval, calves are now being born to and raised by ever younger and inexperienced mothers. Young orphaned elephants, meanwhile, that have witnessed the death of a parent at the hands of poachers are coming of age in the absence of the support system that defines traditional elephant life. \u2018\u2018The loss of elephant elders,\u2019\u2019 Bradshaw told me, \u2018\u2018and the traumatic experience of witnessing the massacres of their family, impairs normal brain and behavior development in young elephants.\u2019\u2019 \nWhat Bradshaw and her colleagues describe would seem to be an extreme form of anthropocentric conjecture if the evidence that they\u2019ve compiled from various elephant resesarchers, even on the strictly observational level, weren\u2019t so compelling. The elephants of decimated herds, especially orphans who\u2019ve watched the death of their parents and elders from poaching and culling, exhibit behavior typically associated with post-traumatic stress disorder and other trauma-related disorders in humans: abnormal startle response, unpredictable asocial behavior, inattentive mothering and hyperaggression. Studies of the various assaults on the rhinos in South Africa, meanwhile, have determined that the perpetrators were in all cases adolescent males that had witnessed their families being shot down in cullings. It was common for these elephants to have been tethered to the bodies of their dead and dying relatives until they could be rounded up for translocation to, as Bradshaw and Schore describe them, \u2018\u2018locales lacking traditional social hierarchy of older bulls and intact natal family structures.\u2019\u2019 \nIn fact, even the relatively few attempts that park officials have made to restore parts of the social fabric of elephant society have lent substance to the elephant-breakdown theory. When South African park rangers recently introduced a number of older bull elephants into several destabilized elephant herds in Pilanesburg and Addo, the wayward behavior \u2014 including unusually premature hormonal changes among the adolescent elephants \u2014 abated. \nBut according to Bradshaw and her colleagues, the various pieces of the elephant-trauma puzzle really come together at the level of neuroscience, or what might be called the physiology of psychology, by which scientists can now map the marred neuronal fields, snapped synaptic bridges and crooked chemical streams of an embattled psyche. Though most scientific knowledge of trauma is still understood through research on human subjects, neural studies of elephants are now under way. (The first functional M.R.I. scan of an elephant brain, taken this year, revealed, perhaps not surprisingly, a huge hippocampus, a seat of memory in the mammalian brain, as well as a prominent structure in the limbic system, which processes emotions.) Allan Schore, the U.C.L.A. psychologist and neuroscientist who for the past 15 years has focused his research on early human brain development and the negative impact of trauma on it, recently wrote two articles with Bradshaw on the stress-related neurobiological underpinnings of current abnormal elephant behavior. \n \u2018\u2018We know that these mechanisms cut across species,\u2019\u2019 Schore told me. \u2018\u2018In the first years of humans as well as elephants, development of the emotional brain is impacted by these attachment mechanisms, by the interaction that the infant has with the primary caregiver, especially the mother. When these early experiences go in a positive way, it leads to greater resilience in things like affect regulation, stress regulation, social communication and empathy. But when these early experiences go awry in cases of abuse and neglect, there is a literal thinning down of the essential circuits in the brain, especially in the emotion-processing areas.\u2019\u2019 \nFor Bradshaw, these continuities between human and elephant brains resonate far outside the field of neuroscience. \u2018\u2018Elephants are suffering and behaving in the same ways that we recognize in ourselves as a result of violence,\u2019\u2019 she told me. \u2018\u2018It is entirely congruent with what we know about humans and other mammals. Except perhaps for a few specific features, brain organization and early development of elephants and humans are extremely similar. That\u2019s not news. What is news is when you start asking, What does this mean beyond the science? How do we respond to the fact that we are causing other species like elephants to psychologically break down? In a way, it\u2019s not so much a cognitive or imaginative leap anymore as it is a political one.\u2019\u2019 \nEve Abe says that in her mind, she made that leap before she ever left her mother\u2019s womb. An animal ethologist and wildlife-management consultant now based in London, Abe (pronounced AH-bay) grew up in northern Uganda. After several years of studying elephants in Queen Elizabeth National Park, where decades of poaching had drastically reduced the herds, Abe received her doctorate at Cambridge University in 1994 for work detailing the parallels she saw between the plight of Uganda\u2019s orphaned male elephants and the young male orphans of her own people, the Acholi, whose families and villages have been decimated by years of civil war. It\u2019s work she proudly proclaims to be not only \u2018\u2018the ultimate act of anthropomorphism\u2019\u2019 but also what she was destined to do. \n \u2018\u2018My very first encounter with an elephant was a fetal one,\u2019\u2019 Abe told me in June in London as the two of us sipped tea at a cafe in Paddington Station. I was given Abe\u2019s contact numbers earlier in the spring by Bradshaw, who is currently working with Abe to build a community center in Uganda to help both elephants and humans in their recovery from violence. For more than a month before my departure from New York, I had been trying without luck to arrange with the British Home Office for Abe, who is still waiting for permanent residence status in England, to travel with me to Uganda as my guide through Queen Elizabeth National Park without fear of her being denied re-entry to England. She was to accompany me that day right up to the departure gate at Heathrow, the two of us hoping (in vain, as it turned out) for a last-minute call that would have given her leave to use the ticket I was holding for her in my bag. \n \u2018\u2018My dad was a conservationist and a teacher,\u2019\u2019 explained Abe, a tall, elegant woman with a trilling, nearly girlish voice. \u2018\u2018He was always out in the parks. One of my aunts tells this story about us passing through Murchison park one day. My dad was driving. My uncle was in the front seat. In the back were my aunt and my mom, who was very pregnant with me. They suddenly came upon this huge herd of elephants on the road, and the elephants just stopped. So my dad stopped. He knew about animals. The elephants just stood there, then they started walking around the car, and looking into the car. Finally, they walked off. But my father didn\u2019t start the car then. He waited there. After an hour or more, a huge female came back out onto the road, right in front of the car. It reared up and trumpeted so loudly, then followed the rest of the herd back into the bush. A few days later, when my mom got home, I was born.\u2019\u2019 \nAbe began her studies in Queen Elizabeth National Park in 1982, as an undergraduate at Makerere University in Kampala, shortly after she and her family, who\u2019d been living for years as refugees in Kenya to escape the brutal violence in Uganda under the dictatorship of Idi Amin, returned home in the wake of Amin\u2019s ouster in 1979. Abe told me that when she first arrived at the park, there were fewer than 150 elephants remaining from an original population of nearly 4,000. The bulk of the decimation occurred during the war with Tanzania that led to Amin\u2019s overthrow: soldiers from both armies grabbed all the ivory they could get their hands on \u2014 and did so with such cravenness that the word \u2018\u2018poaching\u2019\u2019 seems woefully inadequate. \u2018\u2018Normally when you say \u2018poaching,\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Abe said, \u2018\u2018you think of people shooting one or two and going off. But this was war. They\u2019d just throw hand grenades at the elephants, bring whole families down and cut out the ivory. I call that mass destruction.\u2019\u2019 \nThe last elephant survivors of Queen Elizabeth National Park, Abe said, never left one another\u2019s side. They kept in a tight bunch, moving as one. Only one elderly female remained; Abe estimated her to be at least 62. It was this matriarch who first gathered the survivors together from their various hideouts on the park\u2019s forested fringes and then led them back out as one group into open savanna. Until her death in the early 90\u2019s, the old female held the group together, the population all the while slowly beginning to rebound. In her yet-to-be-completed memoir, \u2018\u2018My Elephants and My People,\u2019\u2019 Abe writes of the prominence of the matriarch in Acholi society; she named the park\u2019s matriarchal elephant savior Lady Irene, after her own mother. \u2018\u2018It took that core group of survivors in the park about five or six years,\u2019\u2019 Abe told me, \u2018\u2018before I started seeing whole new family units emerge and begin to split off and go their own way.\u2019\u2019 \nIn 1986, Abe\u2019s family was forced to flee the country again. Violence against Uganda\u2019s people and elephants never completely abated after Amin\u2019s regime collapsed, and it drastically worsened in the course of the full-fledged war that developed between government forces and the rebel Lord\u2019s Resistance Army. For years, that army\u2019s leader, Joseph Kony, routinely \u2018\u2018recruited\u2019\u2019 from Acholi villages, killing the parents of young males before their eyes, or sometimes having them do the killings themselves, before pressing them into service as child soldiers. The Lord\u2019s Resistance Army has by now been largely defeated, but Kony, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for numerous crimes against humanity, has hidden with what remains of his army in the mountains of Murchison Falls National Park, and more recently in Garamba National Park in northern Congo, where poaching by the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army has continued to orphan more elephants. \n \u2018\u2018I started looking again at what has happened among the Acholi and the elephants,\u2019\u2019 Abe told me. \u2018\u2018I saw that it is an absolute coincidence between the two. You know we used to have villages. We still don\u2019t have villages. There are over 200 displaced-people\u2019s camps in present-day northern Uganda. Everybody lives now within these camps, and there are no more elders. The elders were systematically eliminated. The first batch of elimination was during Amin\u2019s time, and that set the stage for the later destruction of northern Uganda. We are among the lucky few, because my mom and dad managed to escape. But the families there are just broken. I know many of them. Displaced people are living in our home now. My mother said let them have it. All these kids who have grown up with their parents killed \u2014 no fathers, no mothers, only children looking after them. They don\u2019t go to schools. They have no schools, no hospitals. No infrastructure. They form these roaming, violent, destructive bands. It\u2019s the same thing that happens with the elephants. Just like the male war orphans, they are wild, completely lost.\u2019\u2019 \nOn the ride from Paddington that afternoon out to Heathrow, where I would catch a flight to Uganda, Abe told me that the parallel between the plight of Ugandans and their elephants was in many ways too close for her to see at first. It was only after she moved to London that she had what was, in a sense, her first full, adult recognition of the entwinement between human and elephant that she says she long ago felt in her mother\u2019s womb. \n \u2018\u2018I remember when I first was working on my doctorate,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018I mentioned that I was doing this parallel once to a prominent scientist in Kenya. He looked amazed. He said, \u2018How come nobody has made this connection before?\u2019 I told him because it hadn\u2019t happened this way to anyone else\u2019s tribe before. To me it\u2019s something I see so clearly. Most people are scared of showing that kind of anthropomorphism. But coming from me it doesn\u2019t sound like I\u2019m inventing something. It\u2019s there. People know it\u2019s there. Some might think that the way I describe the elephant attacks makes the animals look like people. But people are animals.\u2019\u2019 \nShortly after my return from Uganda, I went to visit the Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee, a 2,700-acre rehabilitation center and retirement facility situated in the state\u2019s verdant, low-rolling southern hill country. The sanctuary is a kind of asylum for some of the more emotionally and psychologically disturbed former zoo and circus elephants in the United States \u2014 cases so bad that the people who profited from them were eager to let them go. Given that elephants in the wild are now exhibiting aberrant behaviors that were long observed in captive elephants, it perhaps follows that a positive working model for how to ameliorate the effects of elephant breakdown can be found in captivity. \nOf the 19 current residents of the sanctuary, perhaps the biggest hard-luck story is that of a 40-year-old, five-ton Asian elephant named Misty. Originally captured as a calf in India in 1966, Misty spent her first decade in captivity with a number of American circuses and finally ended up in the early 80\u2019s at a wild-animal attraction known as Li on Country Safari in Irvine, Calif. It was there, on the afternoon of July 25, 1983, that Misty, one of four performing elephants at Lion Country Safari that summer, somehow managed to break free of her chains and began madly dashing about the park, looking to make an escape. When one of the park\u2019s zoologists tried to corner and contain her, Misty killed him with one swipe of her trunk. \nThere are, in the long, checkered history of human-elephant relations, countless stories of lethal elephantine assaults, and almost invariably of some gruesomely outsize, animalistic form of retribution exacted by us. It was in the very state of Tennessee, back in September 1916, that another five-ton Asian circus elephant, Mary, was impounded by a local sheriff for the killing of a young hotel janitor who\u2019d been hired to mind Mary during a stopover in the northeast Tennessee town of Kingsport. The janitor had apparently taken Mary for a swim at a local pond, where, according to witnesses, he poked her behind the left ear with a metal hook just as she was reaching for a piece of floating watermelon rind. Enraged, Mary turned, swiftly snatched him up with her trunk, dashed him against a refreshment stand and then smashed his head with her foot. \nWith cries from the townspeople to \u2018\u2018Kill the elephant!\u2019\u2019 and threats from nearby town leaders to bar the circus if \u2018\u2018Murderous Mary,\u2019\u2019 as newspapers quickly dubbed her, remained a part of the show, the circus\u2019s owner, Charlie Sparks, knew he had to do something to appease the public\u2019s blood lust and save his business. (Among the penalties he is said to have contemplated was electrocution, a ghastly precedent for which had been set 13 years earlier, on the grounds of the nearly completed Luna Park in Coney Island. A longtime circus elephant named Topsy, who\u2019d killed three trainers in as many years \u2014 the last one after he tried to feed her a lighted cigarette \u2014 became the largest and most prominent victim of Thomas Edison, the father of direct-current electricity, who had publicly electrocuted a number of animals at that time using his rival George Westinghouse\u2019s alternating current, in hopes of discrediting it as being too dangerous.) \nSparks ultimately decided to have Mary hanged and shipped her by train to the nearby town of Erwin, Tenn., where more than 2,500 people gathered at the local rail yard for her execution. Dozens of children are said to have run off screaming in terror when the chain that was suspended from a huge industrial crane snapped, leaving Mary writhing on the ground with a broken hip. A local rail worker promptly clambered up Mary\u2019s bulk and secured a heavier chain for a second, successful hoisting. \nMisty\u2019s fate in the early 80\u2019s, by contrast, seems a triumph of modern humanism. Banished, after the Lion Safari killing, to the Hawthorn Corporation, a company in Illinois that trains and leases elephants and tigers to circuses, she would continue to lash out at a number of her trainers over the years. But when Hawthorn was convicted of numerous violations of the Animal Welfare Act in 2003, the company agreed to relinquish custody of Misty to the Elephant Sanctuary. She was loaded onto a trailer transport on the morning of Nov. 17, 2004, and even then managed to get away with one final shot at the last in her long line of captors. \n \u2018\u2018The details are kind of sketchy,\u2019\u2019 Carol Buckley, a founder of the Elephant Sanctuary, said to me one afternoon in July, the two of us pulling up on her all-terrain four-wheeler to a large grassy enclosure where an extremely docile and contented-looking Misty, trunk high, ears flapping, waited to greet us. \u2018\u2018Hawthorn\u2019s owner was trying to get her to stretch out so he could remove her leg chains before loading her on the trailer. At one point he prodded her with a bull hook, and she just knocked him down with a swipe of her trunk. But we\u2019ve seen none of that since she\u2019s been here. She\u2019s as sweet as can be. You\u2019d never know that this elephant killed anybody.\u2019\u2019 \nIn the course of her nearly two years at the Elephant Sanctuary \u2014 much of it spent in quarantine while undergoing daily treatment for tuberculosis \u2014 Misty has also been in therapy, as in psychotherapy. Wild-caught elephants often witness as young calves the slaughter of their parents, just about the only way, shy of a far more costly tranquilization procedure, to wrest a calf from elephant parents, especially the mothers. The young captives are then dispatched to a foreign environment to work either as performers or laborers, all the while being kept in relative confinement and isolation, a kind of living death for an animal as socially developed and dependent as we now know elephants to be. \nAnd yet just as we now understand that elephants hurt like us, we\u2019re learning that they can heal like us as well. Indeed, Misty has become a testament to the Elephant Sanctuary\u2019s signature \u2018\u2018passive control\u2019\u2019 system, a therapy tailored in many ways along the lines of those used to treat human sufferers of post-traumatic stress disorder. Passive control, as a sanctuary newsletter describes it, depends upon \u2018\u2018knowledge of how elephants process information and respond to stress\u2019\u2019 as well as specific knowledge of each elephant\u2019s past response to stress. Under this so-called nondominance system, there is no discipline, retaliation or withholding of food, water and treats, which are all common tactics of elephant trainers. Great pains are taken, meanwhile, to afford the elephants both a sense of safety and freedom of choice \u2014 two mainstays of human trauma therapy \u2014 as well as continual social interaction. \nUpon her arrival at the Elephant Sanctuary, Misty seemed to sense straight off the different vibe of her new home. When Scott Blais of the sanctuary went to free Misty\u2019s still-chained leg a mere day after she\u2019d arrived, she stood peaceably by, practically offering her leg up to him. Over her many months of quarantine, meanwhile, with only humans acting as a kind of surrogate elephant family, she has consistently gone through the daily rigors of her tuberculosis treatments \u2014 involving two caretakers, a team of veterinarians and the use of a restraining chute in which harnesses are secured about her chest and tail \u2014 without any coaxing or pressure. \u2018\u2018We\u2019ll shower her with praise in the barn afterwards,\u2019\u2019 Buckley told me as Misty stood by, chomping on a mouthful of hay, \u2018\u2018and she actually purrs with pleasure. The whole barn vibrates.\u2019\u2019 \nOf course, Misty\u2019s road to recovery \u2014 when viewed in light of her history and that of all the other captive elephants, past and present \u2014 is as harrowing as it is heartening. She and the others have suffered, we now understand, not simply because of us, but because they are, by and large, us. If as recently as the end of the Vietnam War people were still balking at the idea that a soldier, for example, could be physically disabled by psychological harm \u2014 the idea, in other words, that the mind is not an entity apart from the body and therefore just as woundable as any limb \u2014 we now find ourselves having to make an equally profound and, for many, even more difficult leap: that a fellow creature as ostensibly unlike us in every way as an elephant is as precisely and intricately woundable as we are. And while such knowledge naturally places an added burden upon us, the keepers, that burden is now being greatly compounded by the fact that sudden violent outbursts like Misty\u2019s can no longer be dismissed as the inevitable isolated revolts of a restless few against the constraints and abuses of captivity. \nThey have no future without us. The question we are now forced to grapple with is whether we would mind a future without them, among the more mindful creatures on this earth and, in many ways, the most devoted. Indeed, the manner of the elephants\u2019 continued keeping, their restoration and conservation, both in civil confines and what\u2019s left of wild ones, is now drawing the attention of everyone from naturalists to neuroscientists. Too much about elephants, in the end \u2014 their desires and devotions, their vulnerability and tremendous resilience \u2014 reminds us of ourselves to dismiss out of hand this revolt they\u2019re currently staging against their own dismissal. And while our concern may ultimately be rooted in that most human of impulses \u2014 the preservation of our own self-image \u2014 the great paradox about this particular moment in our history with elephants is that saving them will require finally getting past ourselves; it will demand the ultimate act of deep, interspecies empathy. \nOn a more immediate, practical level, as Gay Bradshaw sees it, this involves taking what has been learned about elephant society, psychology and emotion and inculcating that knowledge into the conservation schemes of researchers and park rangers. This includes doing things like expanding elephant habitat to what it used to be historically and avoiding the use of culling and translocations as conservation tools. \u2018\u2018If we want elephants around,\u2019\u2019 Bradshaw told me, \u2018\u2018then what we need to do is simple: learn how to live with elephants. In other words, in addition to conservation, we need to educate people how to live with wild animals like humans used to do, and to create conditions whereby people can live on their land and live with elephants without it being this life-and-death situation.\u2019\u2019 \nThe other part of our newly emerging compact with elephants, however, is far more difficult to codify. It requires nothing less than a fundamental shift in the way we look at animals and, by extension, ourselves. It requires what Bradshaw somewhat whimsically refers to as a new \u2018\u2018trans-species psyche,\u2019\u2019 a commitment to move beyond an anthropocentric frame of reference and, in effect, be elephants. Two years ago, Bradshaw wrote a paper for the journal Society and Animals, focusing on the work of the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust in Kenya, a sanctuary for orphaned and traumatized wild elephants \u2014 more or less the wilderness-based complement to Carol Buckley\u2019s trauma therapy at the Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee. The trust\u2019s human caregivers essentially serve as surrogate mothers to young orphan elephants, gradually restoring their psychological and emotional well being to the point at which they can be reintroduced into existing wild herds. The human \u2018\u2018allomothers\u2019\u2019 stay by their adopted young orphans\u2019 sides, even sleeping with them at night in stables. The caretakers make sure, however, to rotate from one elephant to the next so that the orphans grow fond of all the keepers. Otherwise an elephant would form such a strong bond with one keeper that whenever he or she was absent, that elephant would grieve as if over the loss of another family member, often becoming physically ill itself. \nTo date, the Sheldrick Trust has successfully rehabilitated more than 60 elephants and reintroduced them into wild herds. A number of them have periodically returned to the sanctuary with their own wild-born calves in order to reunite with their human allomothers and to introduce their offspring to what \u2014 out on this uncharted frontier of the new \u2018\u2018trans-species psyche\u2019\u2019 \u2014 is now being recognized, at least by the elephants, it seems, as a whole new subspecies: the human allograndmother. \u2018\u2018Traditionally, nature has served as a source of healing for humans,\u2019\u2019 Bradshaw told me. \u2018\u2018Now humans can participate actively in the healing of both themselves and nonhuman animals. The trust and the sanctuary are the beginnings of a mutually benefiting interspecies culture.\u2019\u2019 \nOn my way back to New York via London, I contacted Felicity de Zulueta, a psychiatrist at Maudsley Hospital in London who treats victims of extreme trauma, among them former child soldiers from the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army. De Zulueta, an acquaintance of Eve Abe\u2019s, grew up in Uganda in the early 1960\u2019s on the outskirts of Queen Elizabeth National Park, near where her father, a malaria doctor, had set up camp as part of a malaria-eradication program. For a time she had her own elephant, orphaned by poaching, that local villagers had given to her father, who brought it home to the family garage, where it immediately bonded with an orphan antelope and dog already residing there. \n \u2018\u2018He was doing fine,\u2019\u2019 de Zulueta told me of the pet elephant. \u2018\u2018My mother was loving it and feeding it, and then my parents realized, How can we keep this elephant that is going to grow bigger than the garage? So they gave it to who they thought were the experts. They sent him to the Entebbe Zoo, and although they gave him all the right food and everything, he was a lonely little elephant, and he died. He had no attachment.\u2019\u2019 \nFor de Zulueta, the parallel that Abe draws between the plight of war orphans, human and elephant, is painfully apt, yet also provides some cause for hope, given the often startling capacity of both animals for recovery. She told me that one Ugandan war orphan she is currently treating lost all the members of his family except for two older brothers. Remarkably, one of those brothers, while serving in the Ugandan Army, rescued the younger sibling from the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army; the older brother\u2019s unit had captured the rebel battalion in which his younger brother had been forced to fight. \nThe two brothers eventually made their way to London, and for the past two years, the younger brother has been going through a gradual process of recovery in the care of Maudsley Hospital. Much of the rehabilitation, according to de Zulueta, especially in the early stages, relies on the basic human trauma therapy principles now being applied to elephants: providing decent living quarters, establishing a sense of safety and of attachment to a larger community and allowing freedom of choice. After that have come the more complex treatments tailored to the human brain\u2019s particular cognitive capacities: things like reliving the original traumatic experience and being taught to modulate feelings through early detection of hyperarousal and through breathing techniques. And the healing of trauma, as de Zulueta describes it, turns out to have physical correlatives in the brain just as its wounding does. \n\u2018\u2018What I say is, we find bypass,\u2019\u2019 she explained. \u2018\u2018We bypass the wounded areas using various techniques. Some of the wounds are not healable. Their scars remain. But there is hope because the brain is an enormous computer, and you can learn to bypass its wounds by finding different methods of approaching life. Of course there may be moments when something happens and the old wound becomes unbearable. Still, people do recover. The boy I\u2019ve been telling you about is 18 now, and he has survived very well in terms of his emotional health and capacities. He\u2019s a lovely, lovely man. And he\u2019s a poet. He writes beautiful poetry.\u2019\u2019 \nOn the afternoon in July that I left the Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee, Carol Buckley and Scott Blais seemed in particularly good spirits. Misty was only weeks away from the end of her quarantine, and she would soon be able to socialize with some of her old cohorts from the Hawthorn Corporation: eight female Asians that had been given over to the sanctuary. I would meet the lot of them that day, driving from one to the next on the back of Buckley\u2019s four-wheeler across the sanctuary\u2019s savanna-like stretches. Buckley and Blais refer to them collectively as the Divas. \nBuckley and Blais told me that they got word not long ago of a significant breakthrough in a campaign of theirs to get elephants out of entertainment and zoos: the Bronx Zoo, one of the oldest and most formidable zoos in the country, had announced that upon the death of the zoo\u2019s three current elephant inhabitants, Patty, Maxine and Happy, it would phase out its elephant exhibit on social-behavioral grounds \u2014 an acknowledgment of a new awareness of the elephant\u2019s very particular sensibility and needs. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re really taking the lead,\u2019\u2019 Buckley told me. \u2018\u2018Zoos don\u2019t want to concede the inappropriateness of keeping elephants in such confines. But if we as a society determine that an animal like this suffers in captivity, if the information shows us that they do, hey, we are the stewards. You\u2019d think we\u2019d want to do the right thing.\u2019\u2019 \nFour days later, I received an e-mail message from Gay Bradshaw, who consults with Buckley and Blais on their various stress-therapy strategies. She wrote that one of the sanctuary\u2019s elephants, an Asian named Winkie, had just killed a 36-year-old female assistant caretaker and critically injured the male caretaker who\u2019d tried to save her. \nPeople who work with animals on a daily basis can tell you all kinds of stories about their distinct personalities and natures. I\u2019d gotten, in fact, an elaborate breakdown from Buckley and Blais on the various elephants at the sanctuary and their sociopolitical maneuverings within the sanctuary\u2019s distinct elephant culture, and I went to my notebook to get a fix again on Winkie. A 40-year-old, 7,600-pound female from Burma, she came to the sanctuary in 2000 from the Henry Vilas Zoo in Madison, Wisc., where she had a reputation for lashing out at keepers. When Winkie first arrived at the sanctuary, Buckley told me, she used to jump merely upon being touched and then would wait for a confrontation. But when it never came, she slowly calmed down. \u2018\u2018Has never lashed out at primary keepers,\u2019\u2019 my last note on Winkie reads, \u2018\u2018but has at secondary ones.\u2019\u2019 \nBradshaw\u2019s e-mail message concludes: \u2018\u2018A stunning illustration of trauma in elephants. The indelible etching.\u2019\u2019 \nI thought back to a moment in Queen Elizabeth National Park this past June. As Nelson Okello and I sat waiting for the matriarch and her calf to pass, he mentioned to me an odd little detail about the killing two months earlier of the man from the village of Katwe, something that, the more I thought about it, seemed to capture this particularly fraught moment we\u2019ve arrived at with the elephants. Okello said that after the man\u2019s killing, the elephant herd buried him as it would one of its own, carefully covering the body with earth and brush and then standing vigil over it. \nEven as we\u2019re forcing them out, it seems, the elephants are going out of their way to put us, the keepers, in an ever more discomfiting place, challenging us to preserve someplace for them, the ones who in many ways seem to regard the matter of life and death more devoutly than we. In fact, elephant culture could be considered the precursor of our own, the first permanent human settlements having sprung up around the desire of wandering tribes to stay by the graves of their dead. \u2018\u2018The city of the dead,\u2019\u2019 as Lewis Mumford once wrote, \u2018\u2018antedates the city of the living.\u2019\u2019 \nWhen a group of villagers from Katwe went out to reclaim the man\u2019s body for his family\u2019s funeral rites, the elephants refused to budge. Human remains, a number of researchers have observed, are the only other ones that elephants will treat as they do their own. In the end, the villagers resorted to a tactic that has long been etched in the elephant\u2019s collective memory, firing volleys of gunfire into the air at close range, finally scaring the mourning herd away.

Theaters are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/theater.\nPreviews and Openings\n'THE SCENE' In previews; opens on Jan. 11. A buzz-maker at the Humana Festival, Theresa Rebeck's new play is about an out-of-work actor who doesn't solve his problems by having an affair. Tony Shalhoub (\"Monk\") and Patricia Heaton (\"Everybody Loves Raymond\") star (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422.\n'TRANSLATIONS' Previews start on Thursday; opens on Jan. 25. Brian Friel's drama about a British officer in 19th-century rural Ireland deals with themes of language, imperialism and culture clash. Garry Hynes directs (1:55). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200.\nBroadway\n'THE APPLE TREE' The amazing Kristin Chenoweth gives Imax-screen-size life to three curvaceous doodles who by rights shouldn't be any larger than figures in the Sunday funnies. Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's 1966 musical, directed by Gary Griffin, shows its age but is given theatrical verve by Ms. Chenoweth, Brian d'Arcy James and Marc Kudisch (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Ben Brantley)\n'BUTLEY' In this uneasy revival of Simon Gray's portrait of a toxic English professor, directed by Nicholas Martin, Nathan Lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with \"Made in Britain\" engraved on them. A less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n* 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA: VOYAGE' The exhilarating first two installments of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century Russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, these productions pulse with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. Jack O'Brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast that includes Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n* 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's \"Sweeney Todd,\" this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)\n* 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make \"Grey Gardens\" an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n* 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of \"Hairspray\" fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)\n'LES MIS\u00c9RABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n* 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)\n'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)\n'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance. With his irresistibly mannered performance as a laconic doctor, Mr. Nighy mops the floor with Ms. Moore. Actually, he mops the floor with Mr. Hare's play (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\nOff Broadway\n'BECOMING ADELE' Eric Houston's one-woman show about a young Brooklyn waitress's journey to self-actualization imagines a New York where fairy tales are possible even for the very ordinary. The sentiment is heavy and thick, but Kimberly Stern's performance burrows through it to deliver moving moments (1:40). Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Ginia Bellafante)\n'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore)\n*'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)\n'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next \"Rocky Horror Show.\" To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)\n'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)\n'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)\n'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates)\n'MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS' This musical is too big for its stage, but the young turn-of-the-last-century sweethearts have great chemistry, and there are four terrific songs (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Gates)\n'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)\n'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)\n'AN OAK TREE' Tim Crouch plays a hypnotist in this elusive puzzle of a play about grief and the power of suggestion (1:05). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)\n'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quipmeisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)\n'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Neil Genzlinger)\n'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER' As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)\n'25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)\n'TWO TRAINS RUNNING' Directed by Lou Bellamy, a rough-edged revival of August Wilson's 1992 play about the stark economics of life and death for African-Americans, set in a dying diner in Pittsburgh in the late 1960s. The pace drags in this production, but it remains a bracing reminder of Mr. Wilson's singular talent for making cold, hard numbers sing hot, molten blues (3:40). Signature Theater at Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)\n* 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)\nOff Off Broadway\n'STRINGS' Keir Dullea stars in Carole Bugg\u00e9's intelligent but ultimately unsuccessful \"Copenhagen\"-inspired drama about three scientists on a train (1:45). 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, (212) 362-0329. (Gates)\n'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny. (1:00) Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)\n'TRUE WEST' This perfectly pleasant new version of Sam Shepard's sibling rivalry drama tries something new: understatement (1:35). Big Little Theater, 141 Ridge Street, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)\nSpectacles\n'BIG APPLE CIRCUS' One terrific show (2:15). Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500 or (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)\nLong-Running Shows\n'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)\n'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)\n'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)\n'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)\n'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)\n'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)\n'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' \"A Chorus Line\" with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)\n'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)\nLast Chance\n'THE AMERICAN PILOT' The fate of an injured American soldier hangs in the balance when his plane crashes in territory held by rebels fighting a regime backed by the United States. David Greig's play strives for the topical and the universal, but mostly gets hold of the generic (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club's City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)\n'ANNIE' Daddy Warbucks and some elating musical numbers are the real stars of this holiday season extravaganza about the beauty, fashion and socioecomic makeover of an eternally optimistic little orphaned redhead (2:30); closing tomorrow. The Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 307-4100. (Gates)\n'CARRIE' This deliberately cheesy comedy version of Stephen King's prom night horror story has an absurdist attitude, on-target performances and puppets that bleed (1:40). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Gates)\n'CIRCUS OZ' Welcome holiday entertainment (2:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Van Gelder)\n'A CRAZY SOUND' The Italian avant-gardist Dario D'Ambrosi offers a jaunty, unexpectedly feel-good musical about the mentally ill (1:15). La MaMa's Annex Theater, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closing tomorrow. (Zinoman)\n'ESOTERICA' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing tomorrow. (Gates)\n'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)\n'DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS: THE MUSICAL' The beloved holiday classic in a new musical version that honors the spirit and the letter of the original. (The two immortal Albert Hague-Dr. Seuss songs from the television special are included.) It's bloated at 90 minutes, but the kids didn't seem to mind (1:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100; closing on Tuesday. (Isherwood)\n'HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD AND FIND TRUE LOVE IN 90 MINUTES' This refreshing musical, born of the Fringe Festival, about a bookstore clerk, a slacker, a diplomat and a terrorist, has witty songs, wacky performances and an untethered sense of fun (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Gates)\n* 'KAOS' Martha Clarke's clever compaction of a lengthy 1984 film of the same title, by the Taviani brothers, is based on short stories by Luigi Pirandello, set at the turn of the last century in his native Sicily. A beguiling if deadly serious blend of text, dance and music, adeptly performed and made more flavorful, if more exotic, by Ms. Clarke's decision to have the entire text spoken in Italian (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (John Rockwell)\n'MURDER MYSTERY BLUES' This musical adaptation of classic Woody Allen short stories comes off like a collection of loose parts (2:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)\n'RADIO CITY CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR' Mingles tradition and novelty to a festive fare-thee-well (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-1000; closing tomorrow. (Van Gelder)\n* 'STRIKING 12' A minimalist musical about an odd but rewarding New Year's Eve in the life of a guy who hates New Year's Eve. Performed by the indie pop band Groovelily, it's fresh and funny, and features a standout pop score (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)\n' 'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE' Five prominent writers -- Christopher Durang, Mac Wellman, Elizabeth Swados, Roger Rosenblatt and Len Jenkin -- toss off short plays inspired by this Christmas poem, and the Flea Theater's troupe of young actors attack them with verve. The Swados piece, \"Holiday Movies,\" is as wacky as they come (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)\n'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called \"That 80s Show,\" this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)\nMovies\nRatings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.\n'APOCALYPTO' (R, 138 minutes, in Maya) More blood from Mel Gibson, but more \"Braveheart\" than \"Passion of the Christ.\" Ultraviolent entertainment, well executed (so to speak) but not very surprising in the end. (A. O. Scott)\n'AUTOMATONS' (No rating, 83 minutes) Shot in silvery black and white with old eight-millimeter cameras, this shameless ode to '60s sci-fi depicts a blasted future in which the few remaining humans wage a remorseless war of competing beliefs. With its retro look, cautionary theme and endearingly unsophisticated effects, \"Automatons\" leaves us with the comforting notion that the end of the world will look a lot like the beginning of television. (Jeannette Catsoulis)\n'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (Scott)\n'BLACK CHRISTMAS' (R, 100 minutes) It's been more than 30 years since the original \"Black Christmas\" revealed how much fun it could be to unleash a psycho in a sorority house. Glen Morgan's disastrous remake not only sidelines the original's hilariously obscene phone calls but also drags its unseen killer, and his psychoses, into the light. Smothering terror beneath a blanket of unnecessary information, the movie is no more than a dismal Christmas card to its predecessor. (Catsoulis)\n'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn human misery into entertainment. (Manohla Dargis)\n'BOBBY' (R, 111 minutes) Emilio Estevez's picture, which follows a score of characters through the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, is full of noble ambition. The day in question ended with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, an event that hovers over the movie, even though Kennedy himself is visible only in archival clips. A huge cast (including Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Lindsay Lohan and Mr. Estevez) labors to inject a collection of melodramatic anecdotes with portent and significance, but the individual parts of the film tend to be either overdone or vague and slight. (Scott)\n* 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Dargis)\n'CASINO ROYALE' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The latest James Bond vehicle finds the British spy leaner, meaner and now played by an attractive piece of blond rough named Daniel Craig. Zap, pow, ka-ching! (Dargis)\n'CHARLOTTE'S WEB' (G, 113 minutes) Gary Winick's adaptation of E. B. White's great children's novel is faithful to the wit and feeling of the source. The celebrity-voiced animals are charming, and Julia Roberts is in fine form as the heroic spider, whose writing ability saves the life of a pig. (Scott)\n* 'CHILDREN OF MEN' (R, 100 minutes) The end is nigh in this superbly directed political thriller by Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n about a nervously plausible future. Based on the P. D. James book, the film stars an excellent Clive Owen and features equally sterling support from the actors Michael Caine, Danny Huston and Chiwetel Ejiofior, among others, as well as the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. (Dargis)\n'COPYING BEETHOVEN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) The director Agnieszka Holland and her star Ed Harris bring intelligence and passion to a fictional account about the creation of the Ninth Symphony. Diane Kruger also stars. (Dargis)\n'CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER' (R, 114 minutes, in Mandarin) The Chinese director Zhang Yimou aims for Shakespeare and winds up with Jacqueline Susann in this Tang dynasty melodrama roiling with incest, fraternal rivalry and madness-inducing fungus. As an emperor and empress fighting for control of their three sons, Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li lend the film a core of marital toxicity that's deliciously unstable. Directing with operatic delirium, Mr. Zhang has created a movie in which the line between tragedy and black comedy has been all but erased. (Catsoulis)\n'DEATH OF A PRESIDENT' (No rating, 93 minutes) This fake-umentary, the subject of much hyperventilation since it was shown at the 2006 Toronto Film Festival, imagines what might happen if George W. Bush were assassinated. Condemned as irresponsible wishful thinking by some, hailed as a brave artistic statement by others, the movie, directed by Gabriel Range, is far too banal to merit such strong responses. Its formal cleverness wears thin and after a while exposes a lazy, pretentious form of provocation. (Scott)\n'DECK THE HALLS' (PG, 95 minutes) In the holiday tradition of stale fruitcake, ugly snowflake sweaters and food poisoning comes this piece of junk, in which Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito compete to see who can annoy the audience more. (Scott)\n'D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU' (PG-13, 125 minutes) In Tony Scott's preposterous action flick, with Denzel Washington, the gaudy pyrotechnics are nowhere near as jaw-dropping as the screenplay that name-checks not one, not two, but three national tragedies. (Dargis)\n* 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller \"Infernal Affairs,\" it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis)\n'ERAGON' (PG, 99 minutes) This lad-and-his-dragon fantasy set in a land bristling with Tolkienesque nomenclature and earnest British actors is as lacking in fresh ideas as Tim Allen's manager. Directed by the wonderfully named Stefen Fangmeier, it boasts the usual genre lineup: an evil king (John Malkovich), a whey-faced hero (Edward Speleers) and a serene warrior-maiden (Sienna Guillory), as well as the required rebel hordes and bucolic landscapes. Some of the characters won't be returning for the sequel, but no matter. In all likelihood, neither will the audience. (Catsoulis)\n* 'FAST FOOD NATION' (R, 106 minutes) Richard Linklater has turned Eric Schlosser's journalistic expos\u00e9 of the American industrial food system into a thoughtful, occasionally rambling inquiry into the contradictions of contemporary American life. Three stories examine different parts of the capitalist food chain: illegal immigrants from Mexico work in terrible conditions in a meat-processing plant; a restaurant chain executive undergoes a crisis of conscience; and a teenage burger-slinger is drawn into political activism. Mr. Linklater covers a lot of ground, and the result is an unusually funny, moving and intellectually demanding movie. (Scott)\n* '51 BIRCH STREET' (No rating, 88 minutes) The mysteries of ordinary life drive this moving, engrossing documentary, in which the director, Doug Block, tries to figure out his parents' 54-year marriage. (Scott)\n* 'FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' (R, 132 2:12 minutes) Clint Eastwood raises the flag over Iwo Jima once more in a powerful if imperfect film about the uses of war and of the men who fight. The fine cast includes Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach, who delivers heartbreak by the payload. (Dargis)\n'FLANNEL PAJAMAS' (No rating, 124 minutes) The twin specters of Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen hover over this film, which might have been more accurately titled \"Scenes From a Mixed Marriage\" or \"Annie Hall Without Laughs.\" This smart, talky history of a relationship between two New Yorkers follows a Jewish theatrical promoter and an aspiring caterer with a Roman Catholic background from courtship to marriage to separation. (Stephen Holden)\n* 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (\"Wallace and Gromit,\" \"Chicken Run\") is completely delightful. (Scott)\n'FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION' (PG-13, 86 minutes) This satire of pre-Oscar-nomination buzz in Hollywood is far and away the broadest comedy Christopher Guest and his improvisatory company have made. It is also the flimsiest, and unlike Mr. Guest's earlier films, it has no airs of being a fake documentary. As farce trumps satire, the humor's subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, with the brilliant exception of Catherine O'Hara. (Holden)\n'THE GOOD SHEPHERD' (R, 157 minutes) This chilly film about a spy trapped in the cold of his own heart, seeks to put a tragic human face on the Central Intelligence Agency, namely that of Matt Damon. The story more or less begins and ends at the Bay of Pigs. Although the film seems true in broad outline and scrupulous detail, there is something ungraspable and unknowable about this world, even if it is also one we ourselves have helped create. (Dargis)\n'THE GOOD GERMAN' (R, 102 minutes) In his adaptation of the Joseph Kanon novel, Steven Soderbergh tries to resurrect the magic of classical Hollywood, principally by sucking out all the air, energy and pleasure from his own filmmaking. It's no wonder George Clooney, who stars alongside a vamping Cate Blanchett, looks confused. (Dargis)\n'HAPPY FEET' (PG, 100 minutes) The director George Miller gets happy and snappy, then goes dark and deep, in a musical about an animated penguin who was born to dance. Take hankies. (Dargis)\n'THE HISTORY BOYS' (R, 104 minutes) The current of intellectual energy snapping through this ferociously engaging screen adaptation of Alan Bennett's Tony Award-winning play, set in a north England boys' school in 1983, feels like electrical brain stimulation. As two teachers jockey for the hearts and minds of eight teenage schoolboys preparing to apply to Oxford and Cambridge, their epigrams send up small jolts of pleasure and excitement. How to teach and interpret history is the question. (Holden)\n* 'INLAND EMPIRE' (No rating, 179 minutes) David Lynch's extraordinary, savagely uncompromised new film stars a dazzling Laura Dern as an actress who tumbles down rabbit holes inside rabbit holes inside rabbit holes. As cracked as Mad magazine, though generally more difficult to parse, the film has the power of nightmares and is one of the few this year that deserve to be called art. (Dargis)\n'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis)\n* 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott)\n* 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on \"Madame Bovary\" against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)\n'MATTHEW BARNEY: NO RESTRAINT' (No rating, 72 minutes) Alison Chernick's aptly titled documentary takes us aboard a Japanese whaling vessel to witness the filming of the artist Matthew Barney's \"Drawing Restraint 9,\" a love story in which he and his partner, Bj\u00f6rk, dress up, drink tea and transform into whales. But after a meager 72 minutes, the man who stretched an obsession with testicles into a five-film cycle remains as much of an enigma as ever. (Catsoulis)\n'THE NATIVITY STORY' (PG, 100 minutes) Nothing earthshaking, but a fine performance by Keisha Castle-Hughes as Mary offers a glimpse of an interesting movie tucked inside what is otherwise an unsurprising and tasteful Christmas pageant. (Scott)\n'NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM' (PG, 108 minutes) This season's answer to \"Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas,\" it's an overstuffed grab bag in which lumps of coal are glued together with melted candy. (Holden)\n'THE PAINTED VEIL' (PG-13, 125 minutes) Nicely directed by John Curran, this version of the W. Somerset Maugham novel draws you in by turning a distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance with Naomi Watts and Edward Norton. (Dargis)\n'THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) How you respond to this fairy tale in realist drag may depend on whether you find Will Smith's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. (Dargis)\n'ROCKY BALBOA' (PG, 102 minutes) Surprisingly, the sixth installment of this franchise is no embarrassment. Like its forerunners, it goes the distance almost in spite of itself. It's all heart and no credibility, except as a raw-boned fable. From the very beginning, Rocky Balboa was about as lifelike a character as Popeye pumped up with spinach. But that may be the point of a series that peddles the notion that if you dream it hard enough, you can live it. (Holden)\n'UNACCOMPANIED MINORS' (PG, 89 minutes) The title doubles as an advisory. Your kids may like it; pick them up when it's over. (Scott)\n'VENUS' (R, 91 minutes) A modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest -- avuncular and also erotic -- of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great Peter O'Toole. (Scott)\n* 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almod\u00f3var, with Pen\u00e9lope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott)\nFilm Series\nTHE COMPLETE JACQUES RIVETTE (Tonight through Sunday) The Museum of the Moving Image's 22-film retrospective of Jacques Rivette, the innovative French New Wave director, concludes this weekend with two features.

The series winds up today and tomorrow with three features. Arnaud Desplechin's drama \"La Vie des Morts\" (1991), about a family's reaction to a suicide attempt, will be shown with Laurent Cantet's short about high school students, \"Tous \u00e0 la Manif\" (1994). \"Maine-Oc\u00e9an\" (1986) is Jacques Rozier's comedy about train passengers.

This weekend's features include \"Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown\" (1988), Mr. Almod\u00f3var's raucous portrait of the rejected and the high-strung; \"The Flower of My Secret\" (1995), about a romance novelist with creative and personal problems; and \"All About My Mother\" (1999), in which Pen\u00e9lope Cruz plays a pregnant nun. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.org; $10 (but $20 buys a pass to all eight movies). (Gates)\nFRANZ WAXMAN: MUSIC FOR THE CINEMA (Tonight through Sunday, and Wednesday and Thursday) The Museum of Modern Art is honoring Waxman (1906-1967), the German composer, with a 21-film retrospective. This weekend's films include \"Sayonara\" (1957), which employed a mix of American and Asian musical styles; \"Rebecca\" (1940), Hitchcock's haunting translation of the du Maurier romance; and \"Old Acquaintance\" (1943), starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins as longtime friends and rivals.

(Gates)\nPop\nFull reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.\nA-BONES, SWINGIN' NECKBREAKERS (Sunday) Meaty, beaty, big and retro: the brawny sounds of gourmet 1960s-style garage-rock. The A-Bones' take on this sound is brusque and raw, while the Swingin' Neckbreakers play a more controlled version that recalls the Flamin' Groovies, the 1970s band that was perhaps the first (and best) in a long line of '60s garage revivalists. At 8 p.m., Magnetic Field, 97 Atlantic Avenue, between Henry and Hicks Streets, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 834-0069, magneticbrooklyn.com; $15. (Ben Sisario)\nSANDRA BERNHARD (Tonight through Sunday) Expect outrageous comedy, but also expect some oddly dull music from Sandra Bernhard, like her colorless recent holiday song, \"Miracle of Lights,\" or her cover of the late-period Cheap Trick song \"The Flame,\" which is thankfully tucked into a hilarious routine about rescuing her daughter from a bad boyfriend. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7 and 9:30, Sunday at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $45 tonight and tomorrow; $100 Sunday at 7:30, $150 at 10:30. (Sisario)\nBLACK LIPS (Tonight and Sunday) Sounding like a nightmarish variant of the 13th Floor Elevators or the Troggs, the Black Lips, from Atlanta, play a grisly version of 1960s garage-rock that is deliberately damaged.

(Sisario)\nBRAZILIAN GIRLS (Tonight and Sunday) Electronica, a live rhythm section and a wildly cosmopolitan spirit meet a charismatic and unpredictable singer, Sabina Sciubba, in the Brazilian Girls.

(Jon Pareles)\nELECTRIC SIX (Tomorrow and Sunday) Electric Six looks fondly back to the early 1980s merger of rock guitars, disco beats and electro blips, with arch and gleefully overblown songs about dancing and romance, like \"Danger! High Voltage\" and \"Nuclear War\" (\"on the dance floor\"). With the Dansettes on Sunday.

(Pareles)\n* MICHAEL FEINSTEIN (Tonight through Sunday) The strongest incarnation so far of this singer and pianist's annual holiday bash, \"Home for the Holidays,\" a live variety show featuring a six-member band and three backup vocalists, is a perfect showcase for Mr. Feinstein to balance his two sides: a gregarious stand-up entertainer and an intimate crooner dreaming out loud. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11, Sunday night at 9, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095, feinsteinsattheregency.com; $75 cover and $40 minimum tonight and tomorrow night, $650 on Sunday.

(Pareles)\nGLASSJAW (Tonight) This tough-as-nails Long Island band was a big player in the dissonant, tantrum-prone punk subgenre sometimes called screamo or post-hardcore, which peaked in the early years of this decade. A revolving door of lineup changes kept the band from moving forward, but Glassjaw is now reportedly working on a new album.

Or, for that matter, with \"Breaking Free,\" the PG-rated climax from \"High School Musical,\" the Disney Channel phenomenon whose soundtrack is the best-selling album of the year? Performing the songs from this tween \"Grease,\" to the accompaniment of many thousands of squeals, will be the cast of the movie, or at least most of it: Zac Efron, who played the heartthrob, Troy, is replaced here by Drew Seeley, who supplied many of Troy's vocals on the soundtrack. Tonight at 7, Sunday afternoon at 3, Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nassaucoliseum.com; sold out tonight, $35.50 to $55.50 on Sunday.

(Sisario)\nJAMES HUNTER (Tomorrow) After years honing his style in London pubs, this dapper British singer has emerged with \"People Gonna Talk\" (Go/Rounder), recreating with care and affection the smooth, slithery R&B of early-1960s American singers like Sam Cooke and Little Willie John.

Berger and Tony Oursler on a live puppet opera called \"Don't Trust Anyone Over 30.\" But perhaps even more impressive, Japanther has also provided musical accompaniment for a synchronized-swimming performance. Anyone who has witnessed synchronized swimming knows that can't be easy. At 8 p.m., Europa, 98 Meserole Avenue, at Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-5723, europaclub.com; $8. (Sisario)\nMOE (Tomorrow and Sunday) One chord is all Moe needs to start one of its nimble, quick-fingered jams. Its music starts with the Grateful Dead-Allman Brothers hybrids that most jam bands use, and from there it takes off toward Southern rock, spacy interludes or the borderline of funk.

(Sisario)\n* SPOON (Tomorrow) Led by Britt Daniel, one of the best songwriters ever to get stuck with the meaningless appellation \"indie,\" Spoon, from Austin, Tex., accomplishes a lot with a little. Its tight, jabby songs, influenced equally by minimalist post-punk and sentimental white soul, are beguiling miniatures that seem to end just when you think you've figured them out. As a result, you must listen again and again and again. With Benjy Ferree, a rising singer-songwriter from Washington.

Or, at least, bands that sound an awful lot like them, such as the Sword, an Austin, Tex., group that seems to have most of what made Black Sabbath great. Fuzzy, decelerated blues-rock riffs? Check. Sasquatch tempo? Check. Songs about vague industrial-age catastrophes and medieval monsters? Check (\"The Horned Goddess,\" \"Iron Swan\"). Ozzy Osbourne? Well, no, even retro-rock has its limits.

Tom Erdelyi, better known as Tommy Ramone, the band's first drummer (and only surviving original member), plays a mean mandolin in this acoustic duo, singing tautly written numbers -- kind of like Ramones songs, but with tenderness -- about the comforts and subtle politics of home life.

(Nate Chinen)\nBALLIN' THE JACK (Thursday) This midsize ensemble, led by the clarinetist and saxophonist Matt Darriau, customarily spikes a swing-era repertory with madcap irreverence.

(Chinen)\n* SAL MOSCA (Monday) Mr. Mosca has largely based his piano style -- and, to a considerable extent, his career -- on the heady legacy of the pianist-composer Lennie Tristano. But at 79, he assuredly has an improvisational voice of his own; he also has a cult following, chiefly among his former students. He performs infrequently, but that's only one reason that this trio engagement is a noteworthy event.

His current iteration of the group, as heard on the 2004 album \"Horizon Reassembled\" (Palmetto), consists of Terell Stafford on trumpet, Edward Simon on piano, Essiet Essiet on bass and Victor Lewis on drums.

(Chinen)\nClassical\nFull reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.\nOpera\n'THE FIRST EMPEROR' (Tonight and Tuesday night) The excitement of a world premiere at the Met, combined with widespread public interest in the composer Tan Dun, who won an Oscar for his film score for \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\" have resulted in a sold-out run for \"The First Emperor.\" Alas, though the story of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China, who unified the country through brutality and conquest, is compelling, Mr. Tan's ponderous score is a huge disappointment. There are gripping moments, especially some propulsive orchestra passages that incorporate Chinese instruments. But the opera's lyrical flights are slow-moving and sometimes cloying. Mr. Tan has tried to meld Chinese melody and Italianate lyricism. But his music seems caught in some nowhere land between \"Crouching Tiger\" and Puccini's \"Turandot.\" Even the great Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, bravely taking on the challenging title role, cannot save the show. The colorful production is by the Chinese film director Zhang Yimou (\"House of Flying Daggers\"). Mr. Tan conducts. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini)\n'DIE FLEDERMAUS' (Tonight through Sunday night) Now in its 59th season, the Amato Opera continues to stage productions in its tiny quarters on the Bowery. Now offered is Strauss's merry \"Fledermaus,\" with a rotating cast. The quality often varies, but the spirit is usually there. At 7:30, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200, amato.org; $35; $28 for students and 65+, $125 for the New Year's Eve gala. (Vivien Schweitzer)\n'THE MAGIC FLUTE' (Today through Tuesday, and Thursday) Julie Taymor's whimsical, puppet-filled production has gone even more child-friendly, abridged by the director into a 100-minute version with a new English text by J. D. McClatchy. But the Met hasn't skimped on the casts. Today Matthew Polenzani sings Tamino, and Nathan Gunn is a lively, entertaining Papageno; they will be joined tomorrow by the fantastic German bass Ren\u00e9 Pape as Sarastro. James Levine conducts today through Sunday, and Jens Georg Bachmann conducts on Tuesday and Thursday. Today, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday at 1 p.m.; tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out.

(Schweitzer)\n'DIE ZAUBERFL\u00d6TE' (Monday and Thursday) This revival of Julie Taymor's production continues tomorrow at the Metropolitan Opera, complete with the magical puppets and stage effects that made it an audience hit when it opened in 2004. Isabel Bayrakdarian, who sings with a clear, bright, expressive soprano, is a radiant and convincing Pamina. James Levine conducts a cast that also includes Ren\u00e9 Pape as Sarastro, Christoph Strehl as Tamino, Rodion Pogossov as Papageno and Cornelia G\u00f6tz as Queen of the Night. On Thursday Scott Bergeson conducts, and Lisa Milne is Pamina. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $175 to $375 tickets remain for Monday, and $15 to $175 for Thursday. (Schweitzer)\nClassical Music\nAMOR ARTIS (Sunday) Johannes Somary and his fine chamber orchestra and choir have made their New Year's Eve Bach concert a tradition over the past two decades. This performance, the 22nd installment, includes three Cantatas -- Nos. 137, 191 and 200 -- as well as the \"Brandenburg\" Concertos Nos. 3 and 5. At 9 p.m., St. Jean Baptiste Church, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 874-4513, amorartis.org; $40. (Allan Kozinn)\nARTEK (Tomorrow) This period-instrument group offers one of the last celebrations of the waning Mozart year, commemorating the 250th anniversary of the composer's birth. Enrico Gatti, an Italian violinist, leads the orchestra in \"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik,\" \"Serenata Notturno\" and arias from \"Don Giovanni,\" \"Il Re Pastore,\" \"La Clemenza di Tito\" and others, with Jessica Tranzillo, a soprano; Barbara Hollinshead, a mezzo-soprano; Drew Minter, a countertenor; and Philip Anderson, a tenor.

(Schweitzer)\nNEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Thursday) Zubin Mehta returns to the Philharmonic next week. The opening work will be Beethoven's Violin Concerto, with Mr. Mehta's old friend the violinist Pinchas Zukerman as soloist, followed after intermission by Stravinsky's \"Rite of Spring.\" Mr. Mehta's tenure as music director of the Philharmonic has its defenders and detractors. But this Stravinsky score was a specialty of his back then. At 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; sold out. (Tommasini)\nVASSILY PRIMAKOV AND KONSTANTIN SOUKHOVETSKI (Sunday) These two young pianists from the former Soviet Union, both in their 20s, play an interesting program of Beethoven, Czerny, John Corigliano and Tchaikovsky.

(Bernard Holland)\n'THE VERY LEAST OF P. D. Q. BACH' (Tuesday) Skewering the traditions of the classical music world is one thing; finding the comedic opportunities inherent in the music itself is another, and that is Peter Schickele's art. His canvas is the life and work of P. D. Q. Bach, the fictional \"last and least\" of J. S. Bach's progeny. With Mr. Schickele as guide and commentator, Xian Zhang will lead the New York Philharmonic in a program that includes the \"Desecration of the House\" Overture, the \"1712\" Overture, \"Eine Kleine Kiddiemusik,\" the Prelude to \"Einstein on the Fritz\" and a venerable P. D. Q. classic, the \"Pervertimento\" for bagpipes, bicycle, balloons and strings. At 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $30 to $90.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.\nMuseums\n* American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Roberta Smith)\nBROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'Tigers of Wrath: Watercolors by Walton Ford,' through Jan. 28. This show assembles more than 50 of Mr. Ford's large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora. They frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images the sense is that some horrible violence has occurred or is about to happen. This artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.(Benjamin Genocchio)\nCooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,' through July 29. This ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas, sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith)\n* GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso, TIME, TRUTH, AND HISTORY' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Vel\u00e1zquezes and Zurbar\u00e1ns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dal\u00eds and Picassos, many famous, many not. The big point is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Vel\u00e1zquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman)\n* THE METropolitan museum of art: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s,' through Feb. 19. This show's 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)\n* THE MET: 'LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL -- AN ARTIST'S COUNTRY ESTATE,' through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound -- and of the Tiffany residences preceding it -- is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (See above.) (Smith)\n* MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,' through March 4. Saul Steinberg's famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 drawings, collages and constructions goes on, Steinberg's progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like \"Feet on Chair\" (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like \"Street War (Cadavre Exquisis)\" (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Grace Glueck)\n* MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG'S NEW YORK,' through March 25. A very lively adjunct to the Morgan show, this smaller display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here looming majestically over brownstones and in another incarnation, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg's eyes, could be monuments, too. And no one ever fully appreciated the impact of upscale New York women until Steinberg the misogynist came along. \"Fur Coats\" (1951) portrays four expensive baroque pelts wearing four women, and it's dead on. You may think you know Steinberg's work, but these shows make it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Glueck)\n* NEUE GALLERY: 'JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,' through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Mr. Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or \"total work of art,\" orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Glueck)\nQueens Museum of Art: 'Queens International 2006: Everything All at Once,' through Jan. 14. The 52 artists and two collaboratives in this exhibition are natives of various regions of North America, as well as of Bosnia, China, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Peru and Venezuela. The only common ground, perhaps, is that they all live in Queens. Instead of arranging the work according to medium, ethnicity or generalized themes, the curators follow the edict of the exhibition's subtitle. The show tries to balance the interests of the art crowd and local residents. Sometimes these concerns dovetail nicely, as in Sophia Peer's quick-cut video \"Everyday,\" which shows her aging parents moving around their cramped home in Queens like latter-day, empty-nest Bunkers. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, www.queensmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)\nStudio Museum in Harlem: 'Africa Comics,' through March 18. Intense is the word for this modest-size first-time United States survey of designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense, the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. The entertainment value is high. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids, and the schlumpy but wily character named Goorgoolou from Senegal. But more often than not, humor is sugarcoating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)\nWhitney Museum of American Art: 'Kiki Smith: A Gathering, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float here: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter)\nGalleries: Chelsea\n* ATELIER VAN LIESHOUT: SLAVECITY In this only partly satirical show, architectural scale models, drawings, sculpture, a map and an extensive business plan propose a highly efficient, completely self-sufficient city whose \"participants\" each have a desk job, a farm job and very little time off. The tyranny of it all is brought home in the second gallery, which contains the \"Midi Disciplinator,\" a cell built to accommodate 18 people working in shifts, filing logs into sawdust for no good reason. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, through Jan. 6. (Smith)\n* Noah Fischer, 'Rhetoric Machine' This young, Brooklyn-based artist has a winner of a first New York solo: a two-room, Rube-Goldbergesque kinetic environment set to a score of clips from doom-threatening speeches by United States presidents, ardent pop love songs and the baseline sound of jets and bombs. In sync with the soundtrack, low-tech, handmade light-projecting machines whir and jerk into life, turning the show into a combination of modernist ballet m\u00e9canique and gothic danse macabre. Technically ingenious and full of ideas, the show takes approximately 10 minutes to complete one sound-and-motion cycle. Oliver Kamm/5BE, 621 West 27th Street, (212) 255-0979, 5begallery.com, through Jan. 6. (Cotter)\n* CANDIDA HOFER In large color photographs of the different galleries of the Louvre, taken on Tuesdays when the museum is closed, both the long, vaulted spaces and the painting and sculpture they contain speak of different times and styles. Equally effecting, if not a little frightening, is the lavish, timeless grandeur of these vistas. A palace that became a museum, the Louvre is also a precursor of the barrel-vaulted arcades that sprang up in Paris in the first half of the 19th century. Most of them are gone, but the Louvre's arcades live on. Sort of. Sonnabend Gallery, 536 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-1018. (Smith)\n* CHEYNEY THOMPSON: 'QUELQUES ASPECTS DE L'ART BOURGEOIS: LA NON-INTERVENTION' A teasing, tantalizing, subtly beautiful show by one of the sharper young artists of the moment explores the tensions between street and studio, skill and skepticism, painting and nonpainting and culture and commerce with seemingly abstract canvases, photographs framed by folding street-vendor tables and tinted off-set lithographs of the gallery's storage shelves. The title translates as \"Certain Aspects of Bourgeois Art: Non-Intervention.\" Andrew Kreps, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 741-8849, through Jan. 6. (Smith)\n* 'When the Revolution Comes' The artist Michael St. John has brought some interesting people together in this scrappy, savory group show. It's great to revisit Nancy Grossman's leather-bound heads, looking as radical as they did 30 years ago, and Holt Quentel's distressed gray banners from the 1980s, out of view since but looking right, right now. Strong young artists like Nate Lowman, Joshua Weintraub and Josh White sustain growing reputations, and a bevy of less familiar figures -- Jamal Cyrus, A. J. Bocchino, Alex McQuilkan and Ellwyn Palmerton -- look good. Also in the gallery: a small solo of vivacious, minutely detailed drawings by Josedgardo Granados that bring pre-Columbian and post-Columbian worlds together in a cultural and psychic revolution still in progress. Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts, 508 West 26th Street, Suite 5A, (212) 463-8500, kathleencullenfinearts.com, through Jan. 6. (Cotter)\nOther Galleries\n* 'November' The Los Angeles- based curator Jeffrey Uslip put together this obliquely topical group show, which includes several young West Coast-based artists. In a Babel-ish moment in art, language, scrambled and obscured, is one of the themes here, with Kara Tanaka's listening-booth sculpture transmuting past conversations into a melancholic music. Landscape as poisoned terrain is another. Surrealism, art's 21st-century Esperanto, is the prevailing language. Harris Lieberman, 89 Vandam Street, between Greenwich and Hudson, South Village, (212) 206-1290, harrislieberman.com, through Jan. 6. (Cotter)\nLast Chance\n* 'AMERICAN MASTERWORKS FROM THE MUNSON-WILLIAMS-PROCTOR ARTS INSTITUTE' This Utica, N.Y., institution, celebrating its educational alliance with the Pratt Institute in New York City, is showing more than 75 paintings, drawings, sculptures and furniture pieces, from the 18th to the 20th centuries. A highlight is the original version of Thomas Cole's moving allegory \"The Voyage of Life\" (1839-40), which in four monumental canvases compares the journey from childhood to old age to the winding course of a river. A smashing portrait of the Revolutionary War general Peter Gansevoort (about 1794), by Gilbert Stuart, is a distinguished entry from the earlier part of the show. Post-World War II paintings by Pollock and Rothko add to the buzz. Hirschl & Adler, 21 East 70th Street, (212) 535-8810, hirschlandadler.com; closes today. (Glueck)\n* Asia Society: 'Gilded Splendor: Treasures of China's Liao Empire (907-1125)' The first major display of Liao objects outside China, this show gives the lie to the idea of the Khitan as cultural nobodies. Among the more exotic exhibits are those that reveal Khitan burial customs for royal personages: the corpse was first embalmed and then carefully wrapped in silk, and the adornments included a whole-body netting, a metal mask of gold or lesser material, a burial suit and an overcoat. The Khitan taste for jewelry, too, is evident in the elaborate, exquisitely worked examples on display. Ceramics, wood carvings, painted screens and belts and other personal objects; bronze mirrors that studded the outside of the White Pagoda; writing instruments, embroidered fabrics, miniature pagodas used as containers for Buddhist scriptures; and even an ancient spittoon add to the bite and flavor of this show. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org; closes on Sunday. (Glueck)\n* Dahesh Museum of Art: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT' Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of \"Description de l'\u00c9gypte.\" Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this engrossing if somewhat strange show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606, daheshmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)\n* Frick Collection: 'CIMABUE AND EARLY ITALIAN DEVOTIONAL PAINTING' Weighing in at 6 works of art, with about 20 images among them, this is one of the most stupendous very small exhibitions most of us are likely to see. It reunites two small, beautiful, newly attributed panels by the Italian master Cimabue, whose turn toward naturalism increased the sense of space, gesture and feeling in Florentine painting, and helped set the Renaissance in motion. The panels, which depict a Virgin and Child Enthroned and a Flagellation and may be from the same altarpiece, are flanked by related works that highlight Cimabue's radicalness without letting it completely steal the show. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700; closes on Sunday. (Smith)\nMuseum of Modern Art: 'Eye on Europe: Prints, Books & Multiples, 1960 to Now' This is a woolly, at times idiosyncratic assemblage of more than 350 prints and multiple editions by 118 European artists. Although they are still often considered secondary mediums, the show charts how prints and multiple editions rose to prominence in the 1960s as an essentially democratic strategy, having largely to do with accessibility and affordability, as artists explored alternatives to conventional painting and sculpture. Following this are displays of artwork by contemporary artists working in these mediums. (212) 708-9400, www.moma.org; closes on Monday. (Genocchio)\nNational Academy Museum: 'Luminist Horizons: The Art and Collection of James A. Suydam, 1819-1865' This show is the first museum survey of the career of this 19th-century American painter and is accompanied by a weighty monograph. His early works were painted in a smooth Luminist style compatible with his material, pleasantly detached scenes of rural tranquillity or calm seas beneath hazy skies. His masterwork, \"Paradise Rocks, Newport\" (1860), is an expansive, low-tide view of a wide, flat beach, meadow and distant rising rocks along the Rhode Island shoreline. The paintings in this show remind us that Mr. Suydam -- and his fellow Luminists -- were a talented group who helped bring a measure of sensitivity, subtlety and poetry to the American landscape tradition. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org; closes on Sunday. (Genocchio)\nParrish Art Museum: 'Roy Lichtenstein: American Indian Encounters' Lichtenstein is more popularly associated with his Pop paintings, often based on comic book images, than with the works here. But in the 1950s, using a somewhat Cubist style, he explored mythic characters like medieval knights or cowboys and Indians. \"Chief Before Teepee,\" an abstract oil painting, and \"Two Wild Indians,\" a drawing, both from 1952, were unearthed by the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation for the show's run at the Montclair Art Museum last year. Parrish Art Museum, 25 Job's Lane, Southampton, N.Y., (631) 283-2118, Ext. 32, parrishart.org; closes on Sunday. (Carol Vogel)\n'Replanting the Community Garden' Organized by the artist Michael Tong, this show consists of two environmental pieces. William Brent, a professional landscape designer, contributes an \"Urban Air Scrubber,\" a closet-size smoker's lounge filled with air-purifying plants. A wood construction by Adam Brent is made of shelves holding miniature plants; it's a model for real plant holders and shelters that might be built in tight urban spaces, an idea that makes particular sense at this venerable, financially vulnerable gallery in a neighborhood where grass-roots empty-lot gardens have long been a source of local pride. Tribes Gallery, 285 East Third Street, East Village, (212) 674-3778, www.tribes.org; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)\nWadsworth Atheneum: 'American Splendor: Hudson River School Masterworks From the Wadsworth Atheneum' Back from a two-and-a-half-year tour at six other American museums, the Wadsworth's formidable collection of 19th-century Hudson River School paintings is on display in this homecoming show. Not every Hudson River collection can boast 11 works by Frederic Edwin Church, 13 by Thomas Cole and 5 by Albert Bierstadt, a leading painter of the American West, along with powerful examples by other artists of the school. They are among the more than 60 paintings on display here. It's rare that you see these ultrafamiliar paintings in such concentration; their combined presence gives the show a synergistic sparkle and energy that you don't get when you see them in smaller groupings. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org; closes on Sunday. (Glueck)\nPaul McCarthy: 'Between Beauty and the Beast' Despite the scattershot nature of this show, mostly of work from around 1990 to 2004, Mr. McCarthy's signature moves and gestures are all here. His scatological side is represented by a selection of drawings featuring crude, sexualized doodles and misspelled messages, unpublishable here, that recall graffiti in public restrooms. In \"Masks\" (1994), the abject and uncanny are explored in a suite of large-scale color photographs of soiled silicon masks that mix fear with surprising pathos. His work also continues to reveal itself as a corrective, or perhaps an addendum, to more antiseptic strains of 1960s Pop. Rather than celebrating or criticizing popular images, Mr. McCarthy plays the role of analyst, musing on the creepy cheerfulness of cartoon characters and their incarnations as amusement park mascots. The seven bright-hued sculptures of \"Dwarf Head\" (2000) borrow from Walt Disney's \"Snow White.\" Only here the dwarfs look decapitated and cryogenically preserved, their cuteness transformed into an eternal, chilling blankness. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy ZPark South, Suite 8D, (212) 955-1785, nyehaus.com; closes tomorrow. (Schwendener)\nCorrection: December 30, 2006, Saturday A jazz listing yesterday in Weekend for the Bill McHenry/Ethan Iverson Quartet at the Fat Cat in the West Village included outdated information. After the section went to press, the shows scheduled for yesterday and tonight were canceled.\nCorrection: January 4, 2007, Thursday An art entry in the Listings pages of Weekend on Friday misstated the surname of the artist whose \"Urban Air Scrubber\" was at the Tribes Gallery on East Third Street in the East Village. He is William Meyer, not Brent. (Adam Brent is the artist who made another work that was on display.)",

Eric Houston's solo comedy about the coming of age of a Brooklynite (1:40). Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200.\n'EXTRAORDINARY DECEPTIONS: A MAGICAL HOLIDAY EXTRAVAGANZA' Starts performances on Tuesday. Get sawed in half at this holiday magic show (1:00). Lion Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4100.\n'THE SCENE' In previews; opens on Jan. 11. A buzz-maker at the Humana Festival, Theresa Rebeck's new play is about an out-of-work actor who doesn't solve his problems by having an affair. Tony Shalhoub (\"Monk\") and Patricia Heaton (\"Everybody Loves Raymond\") star (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422.\nBroadway\n'BUTLEY' In this uneasy revival of Simon Gray's portrait of a toxic English professor, directed by Nicholas Martin, Nathan Lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with \"Made in Britain\" engraved on them. A less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)\n'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n* 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA: VOYAGE' The exhilarating first installment of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century Russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, this production pulses with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. Jack O'Brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast, led by Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n* 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's \"Sweeney Todd,\" this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n* 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make \"Grey Gardens\" an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n* 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)\n'LES MIS\u00c9RABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n* 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)\n'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance. With his irresistibly mannered performance as a laconic doctor, Mr. Nighy mops the floor with Ms. Moore. Actually, he mops the floor with Mr. Hare's play (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\nOff Broadway\n'THE AMERICAN PILOT' The fate of an injured American soldier hangs in the balance when his plane crashes in territory held by rebels fighting a regime backed by the United States. David Greig's play strives for the topical and the universal, but mostly gets hold of the generic (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club's City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)\n'ANNIE' Daddy Warbucks and some elating musical numbers are the real stars of this holiday-season extravaganza about the beauty, fashion and socioecomic makeover of an eternally optimistic little orphaned redhead (2:30). The Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 307-4100. (Anita Gates)\n'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore)\n'CARRIE' This deliberately cheesy comedy version of Stephen King's prom-night horror story has an absurdist attitude, on-target performances and puppets that bleed (1:40). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Gates)\n*'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)\n'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next \"Rocky Horror Show.\" To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00) New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)\n'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)\n* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, \"everything old is old again\" (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)\n* 'HOME' Almost nothing happens in David Storey's \"Home\" -- except to those lucky enough to be in the audience, who are likely to find themselves profoundly touched by this portrait of four lost souls in a home for the mentally challenged or disturbed. The play hasn't been seen much since it was on Broadway in 1970, but the Actors Company Theater's production makes you wonder why. The performances by the four leads, Simon Jones, Larry Keith, Cynthia Harris and Cynthia Darlow, are simply exquisite. Samuel Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger)\n'HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD AND FIND TRUE LOVE IN 90 MINUTES' This refreshing musical, born of the Fringe Festival, about a bookstore clerk, a slacker, a diplomat and a terrorist, has witty songs, wacky performances and an untethered sense of fun (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)\n'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates)\n* 'KAOS' Martha Clarke's clever compaction of a lengthy 1984 film of the same title, by the Taviani brothers, is based on short stories by Luigi Pirandello, set at the turn of the last century in his native Sicily. A beguiling if deadly serious blend of text, dance and music, adeptly performed and made more flavorful, if more exotic, by Ms. Clarke's decision to have the entire text spoken in Italian (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (John Rockwell)\n'MURDER MYSTERY BLUES' This musical adaptation of classic Woody Allen short stories comes off like a collection of loose parts (2:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman)\n'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)\n'AN OAK TREE' Tim Crouch plays a hypnotist in this elusive puzzle of a play about grief and the power of suggestion (1:05). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)\n'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quipmeisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)\n'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this old comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). The SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger)\n* 'STRIKING 12' A minimalist musical about an odd but rewarding New Year's Eve in the life of a guy who hates New Year's Eve. Performed by the indie pop band Groovelily, it's fresh and funny, and features a standout pop score (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)\n'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER' As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)\n'THAT TIME OF YEAR' Who would have thought that fruitcake jokes could still be funny? But three singing fruitcakes are among the daffy high points of this original musical revue, which surprises repeatedly by getting laughs from standard-issue seasonal themes both Jewish and Christian. There are clunkers, but you leave feeling that the season's a bit brighter (2:00). Theater at St. Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 935-5820. (Genzlinger)\n'25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)\n'TWO TRAINS RUNNING' Directed by Lou Bellamy, a rough-edged revival of August Wilson's 1992 play about the stark economics of life and death for African-Americans, set in a dying diner in Pittsburgh in the late 1960s. The pace drags in this production, but it remains a bracing reminder of Mr. Wilson's singular talent for making cold, hard numbers sing hot, molten blues (3:40). Signature Theater at Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)\n'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50).

(Isherwood)\nOff Off Broadway\n'NEVER MISSED A DAY' A well-observed and sometimes funny play about a group of co-workers who are giving their souls to the company, and one who has lived to regret it.

(Brantley)\nLast Chance\n'ALL THE WAY HOME' The play won a Pulitzer Prize, but in this revival by the Transport Group it is Sandra Goldmark's simple, striking set that first gets your attention, and then keeps refocusing it during a show that runs almost three hours. Amid her doll-size houses, the human actors seem like giants, but as the play progresses, it becomes apparent that the characters they play are anything but. The acting is excellent, though the play, centered on a small domestic tragedy, doesn't have the punch it once did (1:35).

(Isherwood)\n'HEARTBREAK HOUSE' A ripping revival of Shaw's comedy about the English gentry waltzing toward the abyss as the shadow of World War I looms. Philip Bosco, as the admirably sane madman Captain Shotover, and Swoosie Kurtz, as his swaggeringly romantic daughter, lead the superb cast, under the sharp direction of Robin Lefevre. Nearly a century after its composition, the play still sparkles with wit and sends a shiver down the spine too (2:30).

(Genzlinger)\n'MY NAME IS RACHEL CORRIE' A small, intense and loudly heralded one-woman drama that tells the true story of its title character, a pro-Palestinian activist killed in the Gaza Strip by an Israeli Army bulldozer. Yet for all the political and emotional baggage carried by this production, adapted from Ms. Corrie's writings and starring Megan Dodds, it often feels dramatically flat, even listless (1:30).

(Brantley)\n'TWO SEPTEMBER' Mac Wellman calls a halt to his usual brainy wordplay in this surprisingly sober (and rather dry) historical drama that tells two tangentially related stories.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.\n'APOCALYPTO' (R, 138 minutes, in Maya) More blood from Mel Gibson, but more \"Braveheart\" than \"Passion of the Christ.\" Ultraviolent entertainment, well executed (so to speak) but not very surprising in the end. (A. O. Scott)\n* 'THE AURA' (No rating, 138 minutes, in Spanish) A heist, a case of mistaken identity and a lonely, epileptic taxidermist are at the heart of this melancholy, deeply satisfying noir exercise, the second and last feature directed by the Argentine filmmaker Fabi\u00e1n Bielinsky, who died in June. (Scott)\n'AUTOMATONS' (No rating, 83 minutes) Shot in silvery black and white with old eight-millimeter cameras, this shameless ode to '60s sci-fi depicts a blasted future where the few remaining humans wage a remorseless war of competing beliefs. With its retro look, cautionary theme and endearingly unsophisticated effects, \"Automatons\" leaves us with the comforting notion that the end of the world will look a lot like the beginning of television. (Jeannette Catsoulis)\n* 'BERGMAN ISLAND' (No rating, 101 minutes, in Swedish and English) This documentary portrait of the great Swedish director, now 88 and living on the desolate Baltic Island of Faro, is extraordinarily revealing. In this extended interview, interwoven with fragments from his pictures, he recalls his life and loves and discusses his fear of death. The film underscores the intensely autobiographical nature of his art. (Stephen Holden)\n'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn human misery into entertainment. (Manohla Dargis)\n'BOBBY' (R, 111 minutes) Emilio Estevez's picture, which follows a score of characters through the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, is full of noble ambition. The day in question ended with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, an event that hovers over the movie, even though Kennedy himself is visible only in archival clips. A huge cast (including Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Lindsay Lohan and Mr. Estevez) labors to inject a collection of melodramatic anecdotes with portent and significance, but the individual parts of the film tend to be either overdone or vague and slight. (Scott)\n* 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Dargis)\n'CASINO ROYALE' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The latest James Bond vehicle finds the British spy leaner, meaner and now played by an attractive piece of blond rough named Daniel Craig. Zap, pow, ka-ching! (Dargis)\n'DECK THE HALLS' (PG, 95 minutes) In the holiday tradition of stale fruitcake, ugly snowflake sweaters and food poisoning comes this piece of junk, in which Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito compete to see who can annoy the audience more. (Scott)\n'D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU' (PG-13, 125 minutes) In Tony Scott's preposterous action flick, with Denzel Washington, the gaudy pyrotechnics are nowhere near as jaw-dropping as the screenplay that name-checks not one, not two, but three national tragedies. (Dargis)\n'DHOOM 2' (No rating, 151 minutes, in Hindi) A slick and satisfying example of the new, thoroughly modern Bollywood, this cops-and-robbers tale is animated by old-fashioned star power. Hrithik Roshan plays the \"smartest and coolest thief alive,\" and Aishwarya Rai is the small-time crook who loves him. (Rachel Saltz)\n'FAMILY LAW' (No rating, 102 minutes, in Spanish) Exploratory variations on that old saw, \"Like father, like son,\" are the thematic heart of this third installment of the Argentine filmmaker Daniel Burman's semiautobiographical trilogy of films about fatherhood. The delicate, bittersweet comedy about the relationship of father-and-son lawyers prepares you for an eruption of high drama that never arrives. (Holden)\n* 'FAST FOOD NATION' (R, 106 minutes) Richard Linklater has turned Eric Schlosser's journalistic expos\u00e9 of the American industrial food system into a thoughtful, occasionally rambling inquiry into the contradictions of contemporary American life. Three stories examine different parts of the capitalist food chain: illegal immigrants from Mexico work in terrible conditions in a meat-processing plant; a restaurant chain executive undergoes a crisis of conscience; and a teenage burger-slinger is drawn into political activism. Mr. Linklater covers a lot of ground, and the result is an unusually funny, moving and intellectually demanding movie. (Scott)\n* '51 BIRCH STREET' (No rating, 88 minutes) The mysteries of ordinary life drive this moving, engrossing documentary, in which the director, Doug Block, tries to figure out his parents' 54-year marriage. (Scott)\n'FLANNEL PAJAMAS' (No rating, 124 minutes) The twin specters of Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen hover over this film, which might have been more accurately titled \"Scenes From a Mixed Marriage\" or \"Annie Hall Without Laughs.\" This smart, talky history of a relationship between two New Yorkers follows a Jewish theatrical promoter and an aspiring caterer with a Roman Catholic background from courtship to marriage to separation. (Holden)\n* 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (\"Wallace and Gromit,\" \"Chicken Run\") is completely delightful. (Scott)\n'FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION' (PG-13, 86 minutes) This satire of pre-Oscar-nomination buzz in Hollywood is far and away the broadest comedy Christopher Guest and his improvisatory company have made. It is also the flimsiest, and unlike Mr. Guest's earlier films, it has no airs of being a fake documentary. As farce trumps satire, the humor's subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, with the brilliant exception of Catherine O'Hara. (Holden)\n'THE FOUNTAIN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Darren Aronovsky's new film spans a thousand years, as Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman pursue undying love and eternal life in the 16th, 21st and 26th centuries. There is some lovely visual poetry, but the ideas are pure doggerel, an ungainly mixture of sci-fi overreach and earnest sentimentality. (Scott)\n'HAPPY FEET' (PG, 100 minutes) The director George Miller gets happy and snappy, then goes dark and deep, in a musical about an animated penguin who was born to dance. Take hankies. (Dargis)\n'HERMANAS' (No rating, 100 minutes, in Spanish) The ghost of 1970s Argentina haunts 1980s Texas in this perceptive and beautifully acted drama from the Argentine director Julia Solomonoff. After eight years of exile in Spain, Natalia (Ingrid Rubio) travels to Texas to visit her sister, Elena (Valeria Bertuccelli), a suburban wife and mother. Extensive flashbacks to the sisters' teenage years during the military dictatorship reveal a rich vein of familial guilt and long-suppressed resentment. But the movie is most successful in the rocky emotional spaces in which the women struggle to reconcile over a chasm of political discord and unanswered questions. (Catsoulis)\n'THE HISTORY BOYS' (R, 104 minutes) The current of intellectual energy snapping through this engaging screen adaptation of Alan Bennett's Tony Award-winning play, set in a north England boys' school in 1983, feels like electrical brain stimulation. As two teachers jockey for the hearts and minds of eight teenage schoolboys preparing to apply to Oxford and Cambridge, their epigrams send up small jolts of pleasure and excitement. How to teach and interpret history is the question. (Holden)\n* 'INLAND EMPIRE' (No rating, 179 minutes) David Lynch's extraordinary, savagely uncompromised new film stars a dazzling Laura Dern as an actress who tumbles down rabbit holes inside rabbit holes inside rabbit holes. As cracked as Mad magazine, though generally more difficult to parse, the film has the power of nightmares and is one of the few this year that deserve to be called art. (Dargis)\n* 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 2:10 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on \"Madame Bovary\" against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)\n* 'MARIE ANTOINETTE' (PG-13, 123 minutes) In this elaborate, bittersweet confection, Sofia Coppola imagines the last pre-revolutionary queen of France (played with wit and charm by Kirsten Dunst) as a bored, pleasure-seeking teenager trapped in a world of artifice and rigid protocol. Dreamy and decadent, the film is also touching, funny and bracingly modern. (Scott)\n'NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VAN WILDER 2: THE RISE OF TAJ' (R, 98 minutes) Britain and India face off in this strained attempt to transplant the American campus comedy to more uptight shores. Now graduated from college -- and sidekick status -- Taj Mahal Badalandabad (Kal Penn) heads to Camford University in England to pursue a Ph.D. and a bad reputation. While the screenplay dives into British history, and the camera dives into every cleavage in sight, the director, Mort Nathan, harnesses smut and silliness to an oddly innocent tale of true love. (Catsoulis)\n'THE NATIVITY STORY' (PG, 100 minutes) Nothing earthshaking, but a fine performance by Keisha Castle-Hughes as Mary offers a glimpse of an interesting movie tucked inside what is otherwise an unsurprising and tasteful Christmas pageant. (Scott)\n'RUNNING WITH SCISSORS' (R, 116 minutes) From Augusten Burroughs's best-selling memoir, this movie is a showcase of high-quality acting (especially from Annette Bening) without much in the way of dramatic coherence or emotional power. (Scott)\n'THE SANTA CLAUSe 3: THE ESCAPE CLAUSE' (G, 98 minutes) Ho, ho, ho? No, no, no. (Dargis)\n* 'SHUT UP & SING' (R, 93 minutes) Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck's revealing documentary follows the Dixie Chicks around for three years as the group deals with the consequences of a remark by its lead singer, Natalie Maines, who said from a London stage that they were ashamed the president of the United States was from Texas. The movie is a fascinating study of the relationship between the media, politics and the music industry in an era in which pop musicians are marketed like politicians. (Holden)\n'TURISTAS' (R, 89 minutes) If stupidity were a crime, the nitwits in this cheap horror flick would be doing time in Attica. (Dargis)\n'UNACCOMPANIED MINORS' (PG, 89 minutes) The title doubles as an advisory. Your kids may like it; pick them up when it's over. (Scott)\n* 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almod\u00f3var, with Pen\u00e9lope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott)\nFilm Series\nTHE COMPLETE JACQUES RIVETTE (Tomorrow through Dec. 31) The Museum of the Moving Image's 22-film retrospective of the innovative French New Wave director continues this weekend with four features.

In a sweet, tissue-thin voice that can recall Macy Gray or Sade, she sings of sisterly rituals, loves lost and her \"choux pastry heart.\" Mr. Devine, once of the band Miracle of 86, has carved out a niche as a singer-songwriter in the Elliott Smith mold.

(Ben Sisario)\nBOGMEN (Thursday) The fence-mending reunion thing worked well for '90s alternative giants like the Pixies and Dinosaur Jr., so what about the littler guys? A decade ago, the Bogmen were one of the biggest local draws in New York, mingling cynical lyrics with propulsive guitar riffs and the occasional funk rhythm. It was textbook alt-rock, but the Bogmen struggled to find a national audience and disbanded in 1999. The band's three-day revival begins Thursday at Webster Hall. At 8 p.m., 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $50. (Sisario)\nCHAVEZ (Tomorrow) Did somebody say '90s New York alt-rock reunion? A decade ago Chavez's hefty, dissonant guitars and shy vocals fit right in with the music of Pavement, Archers of Loaf and Sebadoh. Now, with a new double album, \"Better Days Will Haunt You\" (Matador), collecting the complete works of the band -- it lasted only three years -- Chavez returns for this concert at Warsaw.

(Sisario)\nMARSHALL CRENSHAW (Wednesday) Mr. Crenshaw's songs seem to roll off the guitar in a casual blend of pre-1970s styles -- folk-rock, surf-rock, country and above all the Beatles -- that put melody first. With his winsome tenor, he delves into the ways love goes right and goes wrong, from distant yearning to the aftermath of infidelity, hiding turmoil within the chiming tunes. With Matt Keating.

(Jon Pareles)\n* THE EX (Tonight) Visits from this long-running Dutch band are too rare. Devoted to leftist political ideals, the group chocks its lyrics full of topical allusions and has been known to include 140-page books about the Spanish Civil War with its albums. Admirable, sure. But in concert the Ex is blessedly all about the beat: a brawny, anxious punk-funk that never releases its tension. The effect is unforgettably visceral. With Arbouretum and DJ/rupture.

(Stephen Holden)\nGOGOL BORDELLO (Thursday) With an untamed stage persona a bit like Iggy Pop and a bit like a paranoid Kafka protagonist, the singer-contortionist Eugene Hutz leads a cultural mash-up of dirty punk, raucous Gypsy music and vaudevillian theatrics.

Also on the program are two Debussy works, \"La Mer\" and excerpts from \"Le Martyre de St. S\u00e9bastien,\" and Sibelius's \"Night Ride and Sunrise.\" At 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $28 to $96. (Kozinn)\nORATORIO SOCIETY OF NEW YORK (Monday) Early-music specialists may slim down their \"Messiahs,\" but the Victorians liked their Handel large and loud, and this venerable amateur chorus keeps that particular flame alive: it has sung \"Messiah\" at Carnegie Hall every year but one since the hall opened in 1891. Kent Tritle, a widely respected organist and choral conductor who is almost as ubiquitous as \"Messiah\" itself on New York stages, took over the group's leadership last year, and will conduct. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $17 to $75. (Midgette)\nTRINITY CHOIR (Sunday and Tuesday) \"Messiahs\" in the New York holiday season are as ubiquitous as Salvation Army Santas. But Trinity Church offers one of the city's best. It features the relatively lean forces of its own choir, suitable to the smallish church, and the Rebel Baroque Orchestra, all conducted by the choir's director, Owen Burdick. Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday at 6 p.m., Trinity Church, Broadway at Wall Street, Lower Manhattan, (866) 468-7619, trinitywallstreet.org; $30 to $50. (Midgette)\nVIENNA CHOIR BOYS (Sunday) Founded in 1498 and counting Haydn, Schubert and the conductor Hans Richter among their illustrious graduates, the Vienna Choir Boys are still going strong. Here the talented young musicians, with pure, treble voices, offer a program of \"spiritual music\" from around the world, including a 13th-century Gregorian chorale, Mozart's \"Ave Verum Corpus,\" Charles Hubert Hastings Parry's \"Jerusalem,\" an Uzbek folk tune, a Peruvian/Quechuan hymn and Andy Icochea Icochea's \"Psalm 61.\" At 7 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $19 to $70. (Schweitzer)\nWEST-EASTERN DIVAN ORCHESTRA (Tuesday) Daniel Barenboim's mixed youth orchestra from Israel, Middle Eastern Arab countries and Spain practices its musical metaphor for peace and cooperation with music by Beethoven, Mozart and Brahms. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $18 to $48. (Holland)\nOXANA YABLONSKAYA (Tonight) The Chopin Society of New York presents an all-Chopin evening with this pianist. She will be joined by the cellist Dmitry Yablonsky, the soprano Inna Dukach and the flutist Sarah Brady. The program includes the Grand Duo on themes from Meyerbeer's \"Robert le Diable\" for flute and piano, four songs, five mazurkas, the Cello Sonata (Op. 65) and the \"Polonaise Brillante.\" At 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $35, $15 for students and 65+.

And Tuesday will mark the first performance of the revival of \"Pas de Duke\" in its original duet form, after the one-shot version with three couples seen at the season-opening gala. Tonight, tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m., tomorrow and Wednesday at 2 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m. and 7:30 p.m., Tuesday at 7 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, alvinailey.org; $25 to $150. (John Rockwell)\nLes Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo (Tuesday through Thursday) The Trocks, as fans call this long-established group, are men in tights -- and tutus and pointe shoes. They can be very funny, but they have also won a reputation for real technical ability and knowledgeable restagings of ballet classics. Highlights of the two programs on offer this year are L\u00e9onide Massine's \"Ga\u00eet\u00e9 Parisienne,\" created for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1938, and Jerome Robbins's \"Cage,\" a chilling portrait of a female devouring its male prey that should be perfect fodder for this company.

Today and tomorrow at 8 p.m., tomorrow at 2 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Sosnoff Theater in the Fisher Center, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7900, bard.edu/fishercenter; $25 to $65. (Rockwell)\nRichard Move/MoveOpolis! (Tuesday through Thursday) Richard Move is best known for channeling Martha Graham, but he also makes more serious dance-theater pieces. This program is a chance to see some of his older works in this vein, as well as \"Toward the Delights of the Exquisite Corpse,\" first shown at the Jacob's Pillow festival this summer. It combines several famous talents -- the visual artist Charles Atlas, the writer Hilton Als, the designer Patricia Fields -- and a bunch of talented dancers.

(Sulcas)\n* NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, Tuesday through Thursday) George Balanchine's prototypical \"Nutcracker\" continues until Dec. 30, with nine performances this week alone. It may be hard on its rotating casts of dancers, not to speak of the orchestra and the stagehands, but it's magic for the audience. Sunday afternoon will offer a cast full of younger dancers in their roles for the first time, including Ana Sophia Scheller as the Sugarplum Fairy, Tyler Angle as her Cavalier and Sara Mearns as Dewdrop. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, tomorrow and Wednesday at 2 p.m., Sunday at 1 and 5 p.m., Tuesday though Thursday at 6 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, nycballet.com; $15 to $110.

(Dunning)\nArt\nMuseums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.\nMuseums\nAmerican Folk Art Museum: 'A Deaf Artist in Early America: The Worlds of John Brewster Jr.,' through Jan. 7. Few Early American artists painted more incisive and empathetic likenesses than John Brewster Jr. (1766-1854), the subject of a fine traveling show at the American Folk Art Museum. And few worked under such potentially limiting circumstances: Mr. Brewster was born deaf in an era before remedial help or a common sign language existed. The case the show makes for Mr. Brewster's physical condition's being reflected in his art is inconclusive, but the paintings are wonderful. 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 265-1040. (Holland Cotter)\n* American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100. (Roberta Smith)\nBROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'Watercolors by Walton Ford,' through Jan. 28. This show assembles more than 50 of Mr. Ford's large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora, produced since the early '90s. They frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images the sense is that some horrible violence has occurred or is about to happen. This artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000. (Benjamin Genocchio)\n* Frick Collection: 'Domenico Tiepolo (1727-1804): A New Testament,' through Jan. 7. The 60 ink drawings by Domenico Tiepolo, son of the Italian master painter Giambattista, have a funny kind of jitter. They look as if they were maybe woven from hair-fine brambles, or done on a ride over rough ground, or in a state of agitated elation. Illustrations of episodes from the four Gospels, they are among some 300 drawings the artist did on subject in a project that seems to have been an extended exercise in personal piety. In them the Christian story of salvation becomes an operatic epic, gravely serious but with notes of homely sweetness: Jesus in Gethsemane delivers his aria of mortal doubt and pain high up on a bare stage, all alone; the Virgin Mary's mother, Anna, aged and stooped, is cosseted by angel-nurses who guide her every step. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter)\n* GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso,' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Vel\u00e1zquezes and Zurbar\u00e1ns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dal\u00eds and Picassos, many famous, many not. The big point is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Vel\u00e1zquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman)\n* THE METropolitan museum of art: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s,' through Feb. 19. This show's 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)\n* THE MET: 'LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL -- AN ARTIST'S COUNTRY ESTATE,' through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound -- and of the Tiffany residences preceding it -- is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)\n* MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,' through March 4. Saul Steinberg's famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything -- Floridians, linguistic concepts, erotica, cowboys, Cubism, nature, architecture and women -- with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 drawings, collages and constructions, arranged in chronological order, goes on, Steinberg's progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like \"Feet on Chair\" (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like \"Street War (Cadavre Exquisis)\" (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008. (Grace Glueck)\n* Museum of Modern Art: 'Manet and the Execution of Maximilian,' through Jan. 29. This small, gripping, focused show reminds us of Modernism's mutinous, myth-scouring origins. And it does so by bringing one of art's great path-cutters, Edouard Manet, onto the scene, wry, politically infuriated and painting like Lucifer. There's not a lot of him here -- eight paintings, three on a single theme: the death by firing squad of the Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian in Mexico in 1867. But it's enough. Manet's images, surrounded here by a riveting selection of prints and photographs, are electrifying, a new kind of history painting that turned an art of pre-set ideals into one of mutable and unpredictable realities. (212) 708-9400. (Cotter)\n* MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG'S NEW YORK,' through March 25. A very lively adjunct to the Morgan show, this smaller display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here looming majestically over humble brownstones and in another incarnation, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg's eyes, could be monuments, too. And no one ever fully appreciated the impact of upscale New York women until Steinberg the misogynist came along. \"Fur Coats\" (1951), portrays four expensive baroque pelts wearing four women, and it's dead on. You may think you know Steinberg's work, but these shows make it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672. (Glueck)\n* NEUE GALLERY: 'JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,' through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Mr. Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or \"total work of art,\" orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. Neue Gallery, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)\n* New-York Historical Society: 'Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery,' through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the '60s, a century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the \"Emancipation Approximation,\" as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show. 2 West 77th Street, Manhattan, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Cotter)\nStudio Museum in Harlem: 'Africa Comics,' through March 18. Intense is the word for this modest-size, first-time United States survey of designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense, the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. The entertainment value is high. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids, and the schlumpy but wily character named Goorgoolou from Senegal. But more often than not, humor is sugarcoating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter)\nWhitney Museum of American Art: Kiki Smith: 'A Gathering, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float in \"Kiki Smith\": men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Cotter)\nGalleries: Uptown\n* 'AMERICAN MASTERWORKS FROM THE MUNSON-WILLIAMS-PROCTOR ARTS INSTITUTE' This Utica, N.Y., institution, celebrating its educational alliance with New York City's Pratt Institute, is showing more than 75 paintings, drawings, sculptures and furniture pieces, from the 18th to the 20th centuries. A highlight is the original version of Thomas Cole's moving allegory \"The Voyage of Life\" (1839-40), which in four monumental canvases compares the journey from childhood to old age with the winding course of a river. A smashing portrait of the Revolutionary War general Peter Gansevoort (about 1794) by Gilbert Stuart and a luscious still life of a steak and with a cabbage and a carrot by Raphaelle Peale (1816-17) are distinguished entries from the earlier part of the show. Post-World War II paintings by Pollock and Rothko add to the buzz. Hirschl & Adler, 21 East 70th Street, (212) 535-8810, through Dec. 29. (Glueck)\n* JOHN CURRIN The leading bad boy of figurative painting is trying his best to be even more provocative. While he usually paints in series, here he has many options under consideration: pornography, romance, still life, portraits of all kinds. The result is a Currin medley that functions as a kind of installation brought off with a new, somewhat vacuous facility. But the paintings with the most Currinesque goofiness and distortions are still the best. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313, through Dec. 22. (Smith)\n* 'THE ODYSSEY CONTINUES: MASTERWORKS FROM THE NEW ORLEANS MUSEUM OF ART AND FROM PRIVATE NEW ORLEANS COLLECTIONS' Nearly 100 European and American objects covering six centuries, from the New Orleans Museum of Art but also from private lenders, are displayed, ranging from the Venetian-born Lorenzo Lotto whose forceful study of an authoritative figure, \"Portrait of a Bearded Man\" (1530-35) is a highlight, to works by contemporary Americans. A showstopper is a full-length portrait of Marie Antoinette (about 1788), by Elizabeth Vigee-Lebrun, in which the doomed French queen wears an enormous feathered concoction on the head she was eventually to lose. Sculptures by Rodin, Brancusi, Louise Bourgeois and Louise Nevelson are also part of the treasures on view. The show is a benefit for the New Orleans Museum, whose building -- though not its art -- was battered by Hurricane Katrina. Wildenstein, 19 East 64th Street, (212) 879-0500, through Feb. 9. (Glueck)\nSigmar Polke Painting is man's oldest conjuring trick, and Sigmar Polke is one of its reigning magicians. In this show, new paintings and those from the 1980s, all two-sided and painted with resin, surround a small selection of German Baroque amber (Bernstein is German for amber) jewelry and exquisite tchotchkes. The paintings, made translucent by the resin, nearly defy deciphering. Doodles and abstract splashes of white paint overlay murky washes of glowing resin on both sides of their membranous support, then cast dim shadows on the wall behind, so that the pictures seem suspended in midair, floating. Michael Werner Gallery, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623, through Jan. 13. (Kimmelman)\nGalleries: SoHo\nSLATER BRADLEY: 'THE ABANDONMENTS' This show features six new, contemplative video works by this 31-year old artist. In \"Dark Night of the Soul\" (2005-6), which invokes Stanley Kubrick's \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" a figure in a space suit is shown wandering through the exotic scenery of the American Museum of Natural History after hours, to the poetic sound of a flute. The chic, odd camera angles suggest detachment, making the suited figure seem as if he were visiting some strange, remote world. Team Gallery, 83 Grand Street, (212) 279-9219, teamgallery.com, through Dec. 23. (Genocchio)\nGalleries: Chelsea\nNathan Carter On the surface, Mr. Carter's work is all about communication, transportation and networks. Big, sprawling sculptures and rough collages recreate the hectic spaghetti of subway lines and the intricate wiring of radio circuitry. The work itself cultivates the look of the amateur, the hobbyist with a ham radio or a backyard workshop and a jigsaw churning out crudely built constructions that look as if they might topple over at any second. At the same time, there's an offhanded vapidity to these references that suggests that they are little more than visual candy for the graphically attuned eye. Casey Kaplan, 525 West 21st Street, (212) 645-7335; caseykaplangallery.com, through Dec. 22. (Martha Schwendener)\nCHRIS DUNCAN: THE CONTINUED EXPLORATION OF PINK AND BROWN In his New York debut, this young artist from Oakland, Calif., continues the tradition of men who draw (and glue) by sewing that dates back at least to Alan Shields. His richly colored, semi-abstract works on paper, sometimes sewn together into expansive surfaces, combine geometric structures with scattered drips, accrue into playful but quietly magnetic m\u00e9langes of decorative and mystical, and East and West. Jeff Bailey Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 989-0156, through Dec. 22. (Smith)\n* GEORGE ORTMAN: EARLY CONSTRUCTIONS, NEW SCULPTURE In the late 1950s and early '60s, Mr. Ortman combined paint, canvas, plaster and wood into geometric reliefs whose every element was physically discrete. Hailed as exemplary \"specific objects\" by Donald Judd, they took some tips from Jasper Johns's flag and target paintings and gave others to Judd's own work. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 242-6242, through Dec. 23. (Smith)\n* TL SOLEIN: INSULATUS In these large, ingeniously-made works on paper, which combine stenciling, bright cutout collage and washy fields of color, Mr. Solein brings his considerable pictorial sense to bear on \"Moby-Dick.\" He borrows from 19th-century illustration and folk art as well as personal memory, creating intimate stage-set-like scenes that can evoke anything from puppet shows to Cubism. The results frequently dazzle and sustain comparison with equally well-sourced but better-known paper wizards, from Donald Baechler to Jockum Nordstrom. Luise Ross Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 343-2161, through Dec. 23. (Smith)\nLast Chance\nLUCIAN FREUD The latest efforts of this British painter conform to a certain Freudian formula. Whether nudes or portraits, most paintings make palpable the claustrophobia of the studio and its harsh light, the dead weight of the people posing and the continuous effort on the painter's part to get things right. As usual there are occasional forays into the outside world and a rather startling self-portrait. \"The Painter Surprised by a Naked Admirer\" shows the artist with a naked female model clinging to his leg as he stands (clothed) poised to work on the very painting we are looking at. Acquavella Galleries, 18 East 79th Street, Manhattan, (212) 734-6300, closes Wednesday.

    "text": "What\u2019s Wrong With Profit?\n2006-11-13T05:00:00.000Z\nCorrection Appended\nTHIS year, as never before, the line between philanthropy and business is blurring. A new generation of philanthropists has stepped forward, for the most part young billionaires who have reaped the benefits of capitalism and believe that it can be applied in the service of charity. They are \"philanthropreneurs,\" driven to do good and have their profit, too.\nAmong them are eBay's founder, Pierre Omidyar, who wants to use investment capital as well as donations to expand the microloan industry, and Stephen M. Case, the co-founder of America Online, who is investing $250 million in companies that help consumers gain control of their health care.\nYoung companies are involved, too: when Google announced its philanthropic effort this year, it unveiled a venture-capital fund rather than a foundation.\nThe approach of these philanthropreneurs reflects the culture of the business that brought them their wealth: information technology, with its ethos that everyone should have access to information. By their way of thinking, the marketplace can have the same level-the-playing-field impact, and supply the world's poor with basic needs like food, sanitation and shelter.\n\"More and more people are asking who else is going to finance doing good if government isn't,\" said Alan Abramson, director of the nonprofit sector and philanthropy program at the Aspen Institute, a public policy think tank in Washington. \"These guys have firsthand knowledge of the market's power, and they're asking themselves why they can't make money and tackle some of the problems once addressed primarily by government at the same time.\"\nIt sounds simple, but the idea of such hybrid philanthropy is upsetting long-held conventions. These new philanthropists view the current foundation model, built on the fortunes of earlier industrial titans like Carnegie and Rockefeller, as hidebound and often ineffective. They have an urge to change the world, and argue that in some cases only the speed of capitalism is fast enough.\n\"We need to be open to bigger, bolder reform because the hard truth is Philanthropy 1.0 hasn't worked well enough,\" Mr. Case told a group of foundation executives in January. \"If you'll forgive the computer metaphors, our system needs an upgrade.\"\nAn upgrade had been in the works courtesy of Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, who had already leveraged the power of the information technology industry in creating the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, with its tens of billions of dollars in assets from him and, more recently, from the investor Warren E. Buffett. The Gates Foundation has led the way in focusing on problems of the underdeveloped world, like disease. But its impact is as much from its size as its way of doing business: it is mostly a traditional philanthropy, writ large.\nWhat the philanthropreneurs have in mind is something different, and it is producing some confusion, as evidenced by an exchange in September on \"Late Show With David Letterman\" between Mr. Letterman and Ted Turner, the founder of CNN and a man who knows something about melding business and philanthropy.\nMr. Letterman asked his guest about a plan announced earlier that day by another philanthropreneur, Sir Richard Branson, to \"donate,\" as Mr. Letterman put it, $3 billion to develop greener fuels.\nMr. Turner cut him off: \"It's not a donation.\"\nRather, he said, it was an investment. \"He's probably going to make more off that investment than he has in everything else,\" he said.\nExperts in philanthropy are not so confused, but they are not bowled over, either -- at least not yet.\n\"I come at this from at least a wonderment of what are the advantages the melded or hybrid model brings,\" said Mark Rosenman, a professor at the Union Institute and University in Cincinnati and an expert on nonprofit matters. \"Though I have no problem with philanthropy and socially responsible business being joined, I do have one with a for-profit enterprise being called philanthropy.\"\n\"I see no clear reasons to begin to develop corporate structures that need to consider themselves more closely aligned with philanthropic purposes,\" Mr. Rosenman added.\nHe said such structures already exist, citing businesses like the Body Shop, which uses its stores and products to inform consumers about human rights and environmental issues and trades with indigenous peoples for supplies and materials.\nMr. Case points to the National Geographic Society, a nonprofit group that is sustained by sales of everything from magazines to toys.\n\"It has basically become a billion-dollar business set up as a nonprofit,\" he said. \"It doesn't have to focus on collecting money or holding black-tie balls to raise money because its sales are sustaining its mission of educating the world about the world.\"\nSo far, there is little criticism of the hybrid proponents, perhaps because they seem to have little interest in capitalizing on the tax benefits of their philanthropy. Google, for example, will pay taxes should its new fund produce returns, and Mr. Omidyar foregoes about $1 million in tax benefits by mixing his philanthropy with business.\nMr. Turner is a relatively old hand at ground-breaking philanthropy, having stunned the world in 1997 with a $1 billion pledge to the United Nations, the largest single pledge ever at the time. But he shares the philanthropreneurs' impatience with the lines drawn by legal, regulatory and tax regimes between business and philanthropy.\n\"There's no way you can invest in polio vaccines and make money,\" he said. \"But developing solar panels, that has profit potential and it's good for the environment. Certain areas of making the world better do lend themselves very comfortably to for-profit operations. Why should we be afraid of that?\"\nHere are profiles of four who are not afraid.\nJeffrey S. Skoll\nAlmost every philanthropreneur starts with a foundation, and Jeffrey S. Skoll, the 41-year-old former president of eBay, was no exception. He worked on the creation of the eBay Foundation, which introduced him to a \"certain breed of nonprofit leader that really appealed to me,\" and creating a foundation to back them with his own money just made sense, Mr. Skoll said.\n\"I had gone from living in a house with five other guys and eating leftovers to all of a sudden having financial resources beyond belief,\" he said. \"It seemed like a good way to put it to productive use.\"\nHe said his dream as a youth was to become a writer who would inspire people and inform them about the world's problems, but he got sidetracked and became a billionaire instead. So he created the Skoll Foundation in 1999 and over time has put $613 million into it, some $90 million of which has been committed to social entrepreneurs and their nonprofits, like the Institute for OneWorld Health, a nonprofit drug company, and KickStart, a nonprofit business that develops low-tech agricultural machines.\nA year later, he started a personal investment fund, Capricorn, and in 2004, he started a film production company, Participant, that has quickly gained prominence for films like \"Syriana,\" \"Good Night, and Good Luck\" and \"An Inconvenient Truth.\"\nHe also has a social networking affiliate, participate.net, which offers users ways to participate in various social movements by helping them send letters to Congress, obtain coupons for low-energy lighting and compare the fuel efficiency of cars, among other things.\n\"The heart of eBay, what made it so successful, wasn't so much the buying and the selling, which was its economic side, but the facilitation of these relationships in its public forums and question-and-answer areas,\" Mr. Skoll said. \"I think these days, people want to join with other people to make change. It's about leverage.\"\nHis nonprofit and for-profit ventures leverage and support each other in the same way. \"An Inconvenient Truth\" examines global warming and climate change, and his foundation supports Ceres, a nonprofit group that works to persuade investors to factor environmental stewardship into their analysis of businesses.\nThrough Capricorn, Mr. Skoll has invested in Falcon Waterfree Technologies, maker of a waterless urinal and known among the Skoll entities as the \"yuck investment.\" Falcon says that one of its urinals saves 40,000 gallons of water a year and reduces wastewater treatment costs. The urinals can be found everywhere from schools in Florida to the Taj Mahal in India.\n\"The idea is that everything, all the resources I have, go into doing good,\" Mr. Skoll said. \"Ultimately, most of the money I make through Capricorn or Participant will go to the foundation, but in the meantime, there's no reason they can't do good, too.\"\nStephen M. Case\nOne would think Stephen M. Case, who is 48, would avoid anything blended or hybrid after the experience he had as part of the team that knit America Online and Time Warner together, one of the messiest mergers in corporate history.\nBut he has become one of the biggest proponents of hybrid philanthropy. \"I think where the lines blur is where it's most interesting,\" Mr. Case said.\nThe Case Foundation recently put $5 million into PlayPumps International, a nonprofit group that has developed a new approach to increasing access to clean water in African villages. In a nutshell, a merry-go-round installed in a schoolyard pumps water from the ground into a holding tank, and families draw water from the tank.\nLike any charity, PlayPumps raises money to buy the equipment. Governments contribute by handing over boreholes and wells. A for-profit company, Roundabout Outdoors, places ads on the sides of the water tanks, which generates the money needed to maintain the system.\n\"There have been many well-intentioned projects related to water in Africa, but what typically happens is that after the initial investment is made, no money comes in to sustain them and they break down and that's that,\" Mr. Case said. \"If all PlayPumps did was install 10 million water pumps by 2020, it would be a great accomplishment, but we've gone the extra step and created Roundabout to build a revenue stream that will ensure those pumps keep working.\"\nSeeking to replicate the model in another area, he founded Revolution in 2005. Its mission is to invest in companies that give consumers more choice and control over everything from health care to car ownership.\nOne such company is FlexCar, which links consumers who want to share a car rather than own one. A member signs up for one of FlexCar's plans and then can reserve a car for pick-up at a specific time and place. Started in 1999 as a public-private partnership involving the city of Seattle and King County, Wash., FlexCar has expanded to Portland, Ore.; San Francisco; Los Angeles; San Diego; Washington, D.C.; and Atlanta.\nThe attractions for Mr. Case are twofold. FlexCar gives consumers an alternative to car ownership at the same time it helps reduce traffic, pollution and energy consumption.\nThe company is turning a profit in its most-established markets, and revenues are growing, according to a spokesman for Mr. Case.\nThen there is Accelerate Brain Cancer Cure, or abc2, a nonprofit the Case family started six years ago in hopes of accelerating research to find a cure for brain cancer, which killed his brother Daniel in 2002. Abc2 has underwritten research on brain cancer therapies and fostered collaboration between researchers, companies and government.\nMr. Case has also created a venture capital fund, Braintrust Accelerator, to invest in companies working to develop brain cancer cures. A share of any profits it realizes will go to abc2.\n\"I'm aiming for a more flexible tool box, not just looking at things through the prism of philanthropy or the prism of business but a fresh creative approach that uses the best of both,\" Mr. Case said.\nPierre Omidyar\nPierre Omidyar is just 39, but in some ways, he is the granddaddy of philanthropreneurs.\nDissatisfied with the momentum and impact of money he distributed through a traditional foundation created in 1999, Mr. Omidyar all but yanked the plug on it in 2004, when he started the Omidyar Network. The Network is the vehicle through which he runs his for-profit investments and nonprofit gifts, as well as a place where the online public can network.\n\"We tried what I would call active philanthropy, where we were working through the foundation with nonprofits to improve their ability to execute, provide guidance, help with professional development,\" Mr. Omidyar said, \"and we learned a lot of lessons, some good and some not so good.\"\nAs he worked through that process, he began to see eBay and the 200 million people using it in a new way.\n\"I could see regular people coming in and saying, 'eBay changed my life because now I feel I contribute to the household's finances,' \" Mr. Omidyar said. \"There was a sense of empowerment even in those early days, and it increasingly became clear to me that eBay has had a huge social impact in the process of running its core business, and it wasn't a philanthropy.\"\nHe has turned his foundation into a roughly $200 million fund to invest in nonprofit ventures and paired it with a similar amount of money dedicated to investment in for-profit ventures. About $21 million in philanthropic money has been invested so far in organizations like Rare, which trains local conservationists around the globe who it hopes to link online, and Youth Noise, a social network for young people interested in social causes.\nWhile those organizations are structured as charities, in many cases they are similar in feel to some of the companies in which the Omidyar Network has made investments, like Prosper, an online person-to-person lending business, and the Enthusiast Group, which works to build online communities of fans of sports and other activities.\nNowhere is the distinction between Mr. Omidyar's for-profit and nonprofit activities more muted than in the area of microfinance, where he has invested more than $33 million, half of it philanthropic.\n\"If you look at the Grameen Bank, that is a business, you can't call it anything else,\" he said, referring to the bank that makes small loans to the poor in Bangladesh. \"Its revenues are greater than its expenses, and it is tremendously effective in pulling people out of poverty. It is proof that you can have it both ways.\"\nIn addition to putting $4 million into Grameen's nonprofit arm, the Grameen Foundation, Omidyar Network has supported nonprofit groups like Unitus, which works to develop microfinance institutions and the International Development Law Institute, for its work on developing law to support the growth of the microfinance industry.\nOn the for-profit side, it has invested in BlueOrchard Microfinance Securities, which packages loans made by microfinance institutions and sells them to institutional investors, and the Global Commercial Microfinance Consortium, an investment fund aimed at increasing the ties between banks and microfinance groups.\nOn top of that, Mr. Omidyar and his wife, Pam, gave Tufts University $100 million that must be spent on developing microfinance. Thus, private capital, philanthropic capital and investment capital are directed toward a single over-arching goal, the creation and expansion of microfinance. \"We're trying to take what a physicist might call a systems-level view and look at how all the sectors, government, business, nonprofit, are interacting and how they can work together for social benefit,\" he said.\nSir Richard Branson\nSir Richard Branson, who is 56, has long mixed it up, building his Virgin Group business empire to encompass airlines, cellphones, record stores, credit cards and pet insurance. In that context, his announcement that he would invest $3 billion in the development of alternative fuels was par for the course, right down to the hubbub that surrounded it.\n\"We have two separate arms, Virgin Unite, the charitable foundation, which is pure giving, and then this hybrid thing, which is our venture capital-charitable unit,\" Sir Richard said. \"It may be giving, it may not be giving, depending on how things turn out.\"\nThe promised investment in alternative energy is an example of what that venture-capital unit is doing, deploying the entrepreneurial flair and skills that have made Sir Richard a billionaire to tackle major global issues like poverty and climate change. \"Although it's very risky capital, hopefully it won't be wasted,\" he said.\nHe considers Virgin Nigeria, the airline he started in 2004 to serve West Africa, another example of such a for-benefit business because, he said, an airline is crucial to wealth creation. \"We may fall flat on our face,\" he said, \"but we're trying to do good and make money.\"\nSir Richard was on the way to Mozambique to explore the possibility of extending the sugar production so abundant across the border in South Africa to that war-scarred country. His idea is to rid the fields of mines planted during Mozambique's civil war from late 1970s to the early 1990s and plant sugar that could be converted into ethanol, tasks that would in turn put thousands of people to work.\n\"There are number of challenges all rolled in to one, but that's why I like it,\" he said.\nVirgin is also working to create businesses that have the socially beneficial aspects of a charity but produce income to sustain themselves, perhaps with a little help from philanthropy. It has teamed up with Anglo Coal, a subsidiary of the big South African conglomerate, Anglo American PLC, and the United States government, to open a clinic in South Africa that provides basic health care for a fee -- and drugs to treat H.I.V. and AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria free. The hope is that the fees generated will cover the costs of the basic services.\n\"The hospital cost $1.5 million,\" Sir Richard said. \"If it saves 60,000 lives, that's good entrepreneurialism as well as good charity work.\"\nHe said he would not try to defend Virgin's efforts from charges that they are really thinly veiled marketing tactics.\n\"If I'm 90 years old and people look to the Virgin brand and say that's the brand they respect most in the world, I would be happy,\" he said. \"Now, if we can in my lifetime come up with a fuel that is a clean fuel and does something to help save the world from global warming, that will be good for the brand, something everyone who works for Virgin can be proud of, but it will also be a good thing for world, too.\"\nA FRESH APPROACH Correction: November 20, 2006, Monday An article in the special Giving section last Monday about philanthropists who want to use for-profit companies in the service of charity quoted incorrectly from a comment by Steven M. Case, the co-founder of America Online, whose foundation has supported a nonprofit group, PlayPumps International. Mr. Case referred to a goal of PlayPumps, which supplies water-pumping children's merry-go-rounds to African villages, of installing 4,000 pumps by 2010, which would give about 10 million people access to water. He did not refer to installing 10 million pumps by 2020.",

    "text": "An Elephant Crackup?\n2006-10-08T05:00:00.000Z\n'We're not going anywhere,\" my driver, Nelson Okello, whispered to me one morning this past June, the two of us sitting in the front seat of a jeep just after dawn in Queen Elizabeth National Park in southwestern Uganda. We'd originally stopped to observe what appeared to be a lone bull elephant grazing in a patch of tall savanna grasses off to our left. More than one \"rogue\" crossed our path that morning -- a young male elephant that has made an overly strong power play against the dominant male of his herd and been banished, sometimes permanently. This elephant, however, soon proved to be not a rogue but part of a cast of at least 30. The ground vibrations registered just before the emergence of the herd from the surrounding trees and brush. We sat there watching the elephants cross the road before us, seeming, for all their heft, so light on their feet, soundlessly plying the wind-swept savanna grasses like land whales adrift above the floor of an ancient, waterless sea.\nThen, from behind a thicket of acacia trees directly off our front left bumper, a huge female emerged -- \"the matriarch,\" Okello said softly. There was a small calf beneath her, freely foraging and knocking about within the secure cribbing of four massive legs. Acacia leaves are an elephant's favorite food, and as the calf set to work on some low branches, the matriarch stood guard, her vast back flank blocking the road, the rest of the herd milling about in the brush a short distance away.\nAfter 15 minutes or so, Okello started inching the jeep forward, revving the engine, trying to make us sound as beastly as possible. The matriarch, however, was having none of it, holding her ground, the fierce white of her eyes as bright as that of her tusks. Although I pretty much knew the answer, I asked Okello if he was considering trying to drive around. \"No,\" he said, raising an index finger for emphasis. \"She'll charge. We should stay right here.\"\nI'd have considered it a wise policy even at a more peaceable juncture in the course of human-elephant relations. In recent years, however, those relations have become markedly more bellicose. Just two days before I arrived, a woman was killed by an elephant in Kazinga, a fishing village nearby. Two months earlier, a man was fatally gored by a young male elephant at the northern edge of the park, near the village of Katwe. African elephants use their long tusks to forage through dense jungle brush. They've also been known to wield them, however, with the ceremonious flash and precision of gladiators, pinning down a victim with one knee in order to deliver the decisive thrust. Okello told me that a young Indian tourist was killed in this fashion two years ago in Murchison Falls National Park, just north of where we were.\nThese were not isolated incidents. All across Africa, India and parts of Southeast Asia, from within and around whatever patches and corridors of their natural habitat remain, elephants have been striking out, destroying villages and crops, attacking and killing human beings. In fact, these attacks have become so commonplace that a whole new statistical category, known as Human-Elephant Conflict, or H.E.C., was created by elephant researchers in the mid-1990's to monitor the problem. In the Indian state Jharkhand near the western border of Bangladesh, 300 people were killed by elephants between 2000 and 2004. In the past 12 years, elephants have killed 605 people in Assam, a state in northeastern India, 239 of them since 2001; 265 elephants have died in that same period, the majority of them as a result of retaliation by angry villagers, who have used everything from poison-tipped arrows to laced food to exact their revenge. In Africa, reports of human-elephant conflicts appear almost daily, from Zambia to Tanzania, from Uganda to Sierra Leone, where 300 villagers evacuated their homes last year because of unprovoked elephant attacks.\nStill, it is not only the increasing number of these incidents that is causing alarm but also the singular perversity -- for want of a less anthropocentric term -- of recent elephant aggression. Since the early 1990's, for example, young male elephants in Pilanesberg National Park and the Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Game Reserve in South Africa have been raping and killing rhinoceroses; this abnormal behavior, according to a 2001 study in the journal Pachyderm, has been reported in \"a number of reserves\" in the region. In July of last year, officials in Pilanesberg shot three young male elephants who were responsible for the killings of 63 rhinos, as well as attacks on people in safari vehicles. In Addo Elephant National Park, also in South Africa, up to 90 percent of male elephant deaths are now attributable to other male elephants, compared with a rate of 6 percent in more stable elephant communities.\nIn a coming book on this phenomenon, Gay Bradshaw, a psychologist at the environmental-sciences program at Oregon State University, notes that in India, where the elephant has long been regarded as a deity, a recent headline in a leading newspaper warned, \"To Avoid Confrontation, Don't Worship Elephants.\" \"Everybody pretty much agrees that the relationship between elephants and people has dramatically changed,\" Bradshaw told me recently. \"What we are seeing today is extraordinary. Where for centuries humans and elephants lived in relative peaceful coexistence, there is now hostility and violence. Now, I use the term 'violence' because of the intentionality associated with it, both in the aggression of humans and, at times, the recently observed behavior of elephants.\"\nFor a number of biologists and ethologists who have spent their careers studying elephant behavior, the attacks have become so abnormal in both number and kind that they can no longer be attributed entirely to the customary factors. Typically, elephant researchers have cited, as a cause of aggression, the high levels of testosterone in newly matured male elephants or the competition for land and resources between elephants and humans. But in \"Elephant Breakdown,\" a 2005 essay in the journal Nature, Bradshaw and several colleagues argued that today's elephant populations are suffering from a form of chronic stress, a kind of species-wide trauma. Decades of poaching and culling and habitat loss, they claim, have so disrupted the intricate web of familial and societal relations by which young elephants have traditionally been raised in the wild, and by which established elephant herds are governed, that what we are now witnessing is nothing less than a precipitous collapse of elephant culture.\nIt has long been apparent that every large, land-based animal on this planet is ultimately fighting a losing battle with humankind. And yet entirely befitting of an animal with such a highly developed sensibility, a deep-rooted sense of family and, yes, such a good long-term memory, the elephant is not going out quietly. It is not leaving without making some kind of statement, one to which scientists from a variety of disciplines, including human psychology, are now beginning to pay close attention.\nOnce the matriarch and her calf were a comfortable distance from us that morning, Okello and I made the 20-minute drive to Kyambura, a village at the far southeastern edge of the park. Back in 2003, Kyambura was reportedly the site of the very sort of sudden, unprovoked elephant attack I'd been hearing about. According to an account of the event in the magazine New Scientist, a number of huts and fields were trampled, and the townspeople were afraid to venture out to surrounding villages, either by foot or on their bikes, because elephants were regularly blocking the road and charging out at those who tried to pass.\nPark officials from the Uganda Wildlife Authority with whom I tried to discuss the incident were reluctant to talk about it or any of the recent killings by elephants in the area. Eco-tourism is one of Uganda's major sources of income, and the elephant and other wildlife stocks of Queen Elizabeth National Park are only just now beginning to recover from years of virtually unchecked poaching and habitat destruction. Tom Okello, the chief game warden at the park (and no relation to my driver), and Margaret Driciru, Queen Elizabeth's chief veterinarian, each told me that they weren't aware of the attack in Kyambura. When I mentioned it to the executive director of the wildlife authority, Moses Mapesa, upon my initial arrival in the capital city, Kampala, he eventually admitted that it did happen, but he claimed that it was not nearly as recent as reported. \"That was 14 years ago,\" he said. \"We have seen aggressive behavior from elephants, but that's a story of the past.\"\nKyambura did look, upon our arrival, much like every other small Ugandan farming community I'd passed through on my visit. Lush fields of banana trees, millet and maize framed a small town center of pastel-colored single-story cement buildings with corrugated-tin roofs. People sat on stoops out front in the available shade. Bicyclers bore preposterously outsize loads of bananas, firewood and five-gallon water jugs on their fenders and handlebars. Contrary to what I had read, the bicycle traffic along the road in and out of Kyambura didn't seem impaired in the slightest.\nBut when Okello and I asked a shopkeeper named Ibrah Byamukama about elephant attacks, he immediately nodded and pointed to a patch of maize and millet fields just up the road, along the edges of the surrounding Maramagambo Forest. He confirmed that a small group of elephants charged out one morning two years earlier, trampled the fields and nearby gardens, knocked down a few huts and then left. He then pointed to a long orange gash in the earth between the planted fields and the forest: a 15-foot-deep, 25-foot-wide trench that had been dug by the wildlife authority around the perimeter of Kyambura in an attempt to keep the elephants at bay. On the way out of town, Okello and I took a closer look at the trench. It was filled with stacks of thorny shrubs for good measure.\n\"The people are still worried,\" Byamukama said, shaking his head. \"The elephants are just becoming more destructive. I don't know why.\"\nThree years ago, Gay Bradshaw, then working on her graduate degree in psychology at the Pacifica Graduate Institute outside Santa Barbara, Calif., began wondering much the same thing: was the extraordinary behavior of elephants in Africa and Asia signaling a breaking point? With the assistance of several established African-elephant researchers, including Daphne Sheldrick and Cynthia Moss, and with the help of Allan Schore, an expert on human trauma disorders at the department of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at U.C.L.A., Bradshaw sought to combine traditional research into elephant behavior with insights about trauma drawn from human neuroscience. Using the few remaining relatively stable elephant herds in places like Amboseli National Park in Kenya, as control groups, Bradshaw and her colleagues analyzed the far more fractious populations found in places like Pilanesberg in South Africa and Queen Elizabeth National Park in Uganda. What emerged was a portrait of pervasive pachyderm dysfunction.\nElephants, when left to their own devices, are profoundly social creatures. A herd of them is, in essence, one incomprehensibly massive elephant: a somewhat loosely bound and yet intricately interconnected, tensile organism. Young elephants are raised within an extended, multitiered network of doting female caregivers that includes the birth mother, grandmothers, aunts and friends. These relations are maintained over a life span as long as 70 years. Studies of established herds have shown that young elephants stay within 15 feet of their mothers for nearly all of their first eight years of life, after which young females are socialized into the matriarchal network, while young males go off for a time into an all-male social group before coming back into the fold as mature adults.\nWhen an elephant dies, its family members engage in intense mourning and burial rituals, conducting weeklong vigils over the body, carefully covering it with earth and brush, revisiting the bones for years afterward, caressing the bones with their trunks, often taking turns rubbing their trunks along the teeth of a skull's lower jaw, the way living elephants do in greeting. If harm comes to a member of an elephant group, all the other elephants are aware of it. This sense of cohesion is further enforced by the elaborate communication system that elephants use. In close proximity they employ a range of vocalizations, from low-frequency rumbles to higher-pitched screams and trumpets, along with a variety of visual signals, from the waving of their trunks to subtle anglings of the head, body, feet and tail. When communicating over long distances -- in order to pass along, for example, news about imminent threats, a sudden change of plans or, of the utmost importance to elephants, the death of a community member -- they use patterns of subsonic vibrations that are felt as far as several miles away by exquisitely tuned sensors in the padding of their feet.\nThis fabric of elephant society, Bradshaw and her colleagues concluded, had effectively been frayed by years of habitat loss and poaching, along with systematic culling by government agencies to control elephant numbers and translocations of herds to different habitats. The number of older matriarchs and female caregivers (or \"allomothers\") had drastically fallen, as had the number of elder bulls, who play a significant role in keeping younger males in line. In parts of Zambia and Tanzania, a number of the elephant groups studied contained no adult females whatsoever. In Uganda, herds were often found to be \"semipermanent aggregations,\" as a paper written by Bradshaw describes them, with many females between the ages of 15 and 25 having no familial associations.\nAs a result of such social upheaval, calves are now being born to and raised by ever younger and inexperienced mothers. Young orphaned elephants, meanwhile, that have witnessed the death of a parent at the hands of poachers are coming of age in the absence of the support system that defines traditional elephant life. \"The loss of elephants elders,\" Bradshaw told me, \"and the traumatic experience of witnessing the massacres of their family, impairs normal brain and behavior development in young elephants.\"\nWhat Bradshaw and her colleagues describe would seem to be an extreme form of anthropocentric conjecture if the evidence that they've compiled from various elephant resesarchers, even on the strictly observational level, wasn't so compelling. The elephants of decimated herds, especially orphans who've watched the death of their parents and elders from poaching and culling, exhibit behavior typically associated with post-traumatic stress disorder and other trauma-related disorders in humans: abnormal startle response, unpredictable asocial behavior, inattentive mothering and hyperaggression. Studies of the various assaults on the rhinos in South Africa, meanwhile, have determined that the perpetrators were in all cases adolescent males that had witnessed their families being shot down in cullings. It was common for these elephants to have been tethered to the bodies of their dead and dying relatives until they could be rounded up for translocation to, as Bradshaw and Schore describe them, \"locales lacking traditional social hierarchy of older bulls and intact natal family structures.\"\nIn fact, even the relatively few attempts that park officials have made to restore parts of the social fabric of elephant society have lent substance to the elephant-breakdown theory. When South African park rangers recently introduced a number of older bull elephants into several destabilized elephant herds in Pilanesburg and Addo, the wayward behavior -- including unusually premature hormonal changes among the adolescent elephants -- abated.\nBut according to Bradshaw and her colleagues, the various pieces of the elephant-trauma puzzle really come together at the level of neuroscience, or what might be called the physiology of psychology, by which scientists can now map the marred neuronal fields, snapped synaptic bridges and crooked chemical streams of an embattled psyche. Though most scientific knowledge of trauma is still understood through research on human subjects, neural studies of elephants are now under way. (The first functional M.R.I. scan of an elephant brain, taken this year, revealed, perhaps not surprisingly, a huge hippocampus, a seat of memory in the mammalian brain, as well as a prominent structure in the limbic system, which processes emotions.) Allan Schore, the U.C.L.A. psychologist and neuroscientist who for the past 15 years has focused his research on early human brain development and the negative impact of trauma on it, recently wrote two articles with Bradshaw on the stress-related neurobiological underpinnings of current abnormal elephant behavior.\n\"We know that these mechanisms cut across species,\" Schore told me. \"In the first years of humans as well as elephants, development of the emotional brain is impacted by these attachment mechanisms, by the interaction that the infant has with the primary caregiver, especially the mother. When these early experiences go in a positive way, it leads to greater resilience in things like affect regulation, stress regulation, social communication and empathy. But when these early experiences go awry in cases of abuse and neglect, there is a literal thinning down of the essential circuits in the brain, especially in the emotion-processing areas.\"\nFor Bradshaw, these continuities between human and elephant brains resonate far outside the field of neuroscience. \"Elephants are suffering and behaving in the same ways that we recognize in ourselves as a result of violence,\" she told me. \"Elephant behavior is entirely congruent with what we know about humans and other mammals. Except perhaps for a few specific features, brain organization and early development of elephants and humans are extremely similar. That's not news. What is news is when you start asking, What does this mean beyond the science? How do we respond to the fact that we are causing other species like elephants to psychologically break down? In a way, it's not so much a cognitive or imaginative leap anymore as it is a political one.\"\nEve Abe says that in her mind, she made that leap before she ever left her mother's womb. An animal ethologist and wildlife-management consultant now based in London, Abe (pronounced AH-bay) grew up in northern Uganda. After several years of studying elephants in Queen Elizabeth National Park, where decades of poaching had drastically reduced the herds, Abe received her doctorate at Cambridge University in 1994 for work detailing the parallels she saw between the plight of Uganda's orphaned male elephants and the young male orphans of her own people, the Acholi, whose families and villages have been decimated by years of civil war. It's work she proudly proclaims to be not only \"the ultimate act of anthropomorphism\" but also what she was destined to do.\n\"My very first encounter with an elephant was a fetal one,\" Abe told me in June in London as the two of us sipped tea at a cafe in Paddington Station. I was given Abe's contact numbers earlier in the spring by Bradshaw, who is currently working with Abe to build a community center in Uganda to help both elephants and humans in their recovery from violence. For more than a month before my departure from New York, I had been trying without luck to arrange with the British Home Office for Abe, who is still waiting for permanent residence status in England, to travel with me to Uganda as my guide through Queen Elizabeth National Park without fear of her being denied re-entry to England. She was to accompany me that day right up to the departure gate at Heathrow, the two of us hoping (in vain, as it turned out) for a last-minute call that would have given her leave to use the ticket I was holding for her in my bag.\n\"My dad was a conservationist and a teacher,\" explained Abe, a tall, elegant woman with a trilling, nearly girlish voice. \"He was always out in the parks. One of my aunts tells this story about us passing through Murchison park one day. My dad was driving. My uncle was in the front seat. In the back were my aunt and my mom, who was very pregnant with me. They suddenly came upon this huge herd of elephants on the road, and the elephants just stopped. So my dad stopped. He knew about animals. The elephants just stood there, then they started walking around the car, and looking into the car. Finally, they walked off. But my father didn't start the car then. He waited there. After an hour or more, a huge female came back out onto the road, right in front of the car. It reared up and trumpeted so loudly, then followed the rest of the herd back into the bush. A few days later, when my mom got home, I was born.\"\nAbe began her studies in Queen Elizabeth National Park in 1982, as an undergraduate at Makerere University in Kampala, shortly after she and her family, who'd been living for years as refugees in Kenya to escape the brutal violence in Uganda under the dictatorship of Idi Amin, returned home in the wake of Amin's ouster in 1979. Abe told me that when she first arrived at the park, there were fewer than 150 elephants remaining from an original population of nearly 4,000. The bulk of the decimation occurred during the war with Tanzania that led to Amin's overthrow: soldiers from both armies grabbed all the ivory they could get their hands on -- and did so with such cravenness that the word \"poaching\" seems woefully inadequate. \"Normally when you say 'poaching,' \" Abe said, \"you think of people shooting one or two and going off. But this was war. They'd just throw hand grenades at the elephants, bring whole families down and cut out the ivory. I call that mass destruction.\"\nThe last elephant survivors of Queen Elizabeth National Park, Abe said, never left one another's side. They kept in a tight bunch, moving as one. Only one elderly female remained; Abe estimated her to be at least 62. It was this matriarch who first gathered the survivors together from their various hideouts on the park's forested fringes and then led them back out as one group into open savanna. Until her death in the early 90's, the old female held the group together, the population all the while slowly beginning to rebound. In her yet-to-be-completed memoir, \"My Elephants and My People,\" Abe writes of the prominence of the matriarch in Acholi society; she named the park's matriarchal elephant savior Lady Irene, after her own mother. \"It took that core group of survivors in the park about five or six years,\" Abe told me, \"before I started seeing whole new family units emerge and begin to split off and go their own way.\"\nIn 1986, Abe's family was forced to flee the country again. Violence against Uganda's people and elephants never completely abated after Amin's regime collapsed, and it drastically worsened in the course of the full-fledged war that developed between government forces and the rebel Lord's Resistance Army. For years, that army's leader, Joseph Kony, routinely \"recruited\" from Acholi villages, killing the parents of young males before their eyes, or sometimes having them do the killings themselves, before pressing them into service as child soldiers. The Lord's Resistance Army has by now been largely defeated, but Kony, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for numerous crimes against humanity, has hidden with what remains of his army in the mountains of Murchison Falls National Park, and more recently in Garamba National Park in northern Congo, where poaching by the Lord's Resistance Army has continued to orphan more elephants.\n\"I started looking again at what has happened among the Acholi and the elephants,\" Abe told me. \"I saw that it is an absolute coincidence between the two. You know we used to have villages. We still don't have villages. There are over 200 displaced people's camps in present-day northern Uganda. Everybody lives now within these camps, and there are no more elders. The elders were systematically eliminated. The first batch of elimination was during Amin's time, and that set the stage for the later destruction of northern Uganda. We are among the lucky few, because my mom and dad managed to escape. But the families there are just broken. I know many of them. Displaced people are living in our home now. My mother said let them have it. All these kids who have grown up with their parents killed -- no fathers, no mothers, only children looking after them. They don't go to schools. They have no schools, no hospitals. No infrastructure. They form these roaming, violent, destructive bands. It's the same thing that happens with the elephants. Just like the male war orphans, they are wild, completely lost.\"\nOn the ride from Paddington that afternoon out to Heathrow, where I would catch a flight to Uganda, Abe told me that the parallel between the plight of Ugandans and their elephants was in many ways too close for her to see at first. It was only after she moved to London that she had what was, in a sense, her first full, adult recognition of the entwinement between human and elephant that she says she long ago felt in her mother's womb.\n\"I remember when I first was working on my doctorate,\" she said. \"I mentioned that I was doing this parallel once to a prominent scientist in Kenya. He looked amazed. He said, 'How come nobody has made this connection before?' I told him because it hadn't happened this way to anyone else's tribe before. To me it's something I see so clearly. Most people are scared of showing that kind of anthropomorphism. But coming from me it doesn't sound like I'm inventing something. It's there. People know it's there. Some might think that the way I describe the elephant attacks makes the animals look like people. But people are animals.\"\nShortly after my return from Uganda, I went to visit the Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee, a 2,700-acre rehabilitation center and retirement facility situated in the state's verdant, low-rolling southern hill country. The sanctuary is a kind of asylum for some of the more emotionally and psychologically disturbed former zoo and circus elephants in the United States -- cases so bad that the people who profited from them were eager to let them go. Given that elephants in the wild are now exhibiting aberrant behaviors that were long observed in captive elephants, it perhaps follows that a positive working model for how to ameliorate the effects of elephant breakdown can be found in captivity.\nOf the 19 current residents of the sanctuary, perhaps the biggest hard-luck story was that of a 40-year-old, five-ton Asian elephant named Misty. Originally captured as a calf in India in 1966, Misty spent her first decade in captivity with a number of American circuses and finally ended up in the early 80's at a wild-animal attraction known as Lion Country Safari in Irvine, Calif. It was there, on the afternoon of July 25, 1983, that Misty, one of four performing elephants at Lion Country Safari that summer, somehow managed to break free of her chains and began madly dashing about the park, looking to make an escape. When one of the park's zoologists tried to corner and contain her, Misty killed him with one swipe of her trunk.\nThere are, in the long, checkered history of human-elephant relations, countless stories of lethal elephantine assaults, and almost invariably of some gruesomely outsize, animalistic form of retribution exacted by us. It was in the very state of Tennessee, back in September 1916, that another five-ton Asian circus elephant, Mary, was impounded by a local sheriff for the killing of a young hotel janitor who'd been hired to mind Mary during a stopover in the northeast Tennessee town of Kingsport. The janitor had apparently taken Mary for a swim at a local pond, where, according to witnesses, he poked her behind the left ear with a metal hook just as she was reaching for a piece of floating watermelon rind. Enraged, Mary turned, swiftly snatched him up with her trunk, dashed him against a refreshment stand and then smashed his head with her foot.\nWith cries from the townspeople to \"Kill the elephant!\" and threats from nearby town leaders to bar the circus if \"Murderous Mary,\" as newspapers quickly dubbed her, remained a part of the show, the circus's owner, Charlie Sparks, knew he had to do something to appease the public's blood lust and save his business. Among the penalties he is said to have contemplated was electrocution, a ghastly precedent for which had been set 13 years earlier, on the grounds of the nearly completed Luna Park in Coney Island. A longtime circus elephant named Topsy, who'd killed three trainers in as many years -- the last one after he tried to feed her a lighted cigarette -- would become the largest and most prominent victim of Thomas Edison, the father of direct-current electricity, who had publicly electrocuted a number of animals at that time using his rival George Westinghouse's alternating current, in hopes of discrediting it as being too dangerous.\nSparks ultimately decided to have Mary hanged and shipped her by train to the nearby town of Erwin, Tenn., where more than 2,500 people gathered at the local rail yard for her execution. Dozens of children are said to have run off screaming in terror when the chain that was suspended from a huge industrial crane snapped, leaving Mary writhing on the ground with a broken hip. A local rail worker promptly clambered up Mary's bulk and secured a heavier chain for a second, successful hoisting.\nMisty's fate in the early 80's, by contrast, seems a triumph of modern humanism. Banished, after the Lion Safari killing, to the Hawthorn Corporation, a company in Illinois that trains and leases elephants and tigers to circuses, she would continue to lash out at a number of her trainers over the years. But when Hawthorn was convicted of numerous violations of the Animal Welfare Act in 2003, the company agreed to relinquish custody of Misty to the Elephant Sanctuary. She was loaded onto a trailer transport on the morning of Nov. 17, 2004, and even then managed to get away with one final shot at the last in her long line of captors.\n\"The details are kind of sketchy,\" Carol Buckley, a founder of the Elephant Sanctuary, said to me one afternoon in July, the two of us pulling up on her all-terrain four-wheeler to a large grassy enclosure where an extremely docile and contented-looking Misty, trunk high, ears flapping, waited to greet us. \"Hawthorn's owner was trying to get her to stretch out so he could remove her leg chains before loading her on the trailer. At one point he prodded her with a bull hook, and she just knocked him down with a swipe of her trunk. But we've seen none of that since she's been here. She's as sweet as can be. You'd never know that this elephant killed anybody.\"\nIn the course of her nearly two years at the Elephant Sanctuary -- much of it spent in quarantine while undergoing daily treatment for tuberculosis -- Misty has also been in therapy, as in psychotherapy. Wild-caught elephants often witness as young calves the slaughter of their parents, just about the only way, shy of a far more costly tranquilization procedure, to wrest a calf from elephant parents, especially the mothers. The young captives are then dispatched to a foreign environment to work either as performers or laborers, all the while being kept in relative confinement and isolation, a kind of living death for an animal as socially developed and dependent as we now know elephants to be.\nAnd yet just as we now understand that elephants hurt like us, we're learning that they can heal like us as well. Indeed, Misty has become a testament to the Elephant Sanctuary's signature \"passive control\" system, a therapy tailored in many ways along the lines of those used to treat human sufferers of post-traumatic stress disorder. Passive control, as a sanctuary newsletter describes it, depends upon \"knowledge of how elephants process information and respond to stress\" as well as specific knowledge of each elephant's past response to stress. Under this so-called nondominance system, there is no discipline, retaliation or withholding of food, water and treats, which are all common tactics of elephant trainers. Great pains are taken, meanwhile, to afford the elephants both a sense of safety and freedom of choice -- two mainstays of human trauma therapy -- as well as continual social interaction.\nUpon her arrival at the Elephant Sanctuary, Misty seemed to sense straight off the different vibe of her new home. When Scott Blais of the sanctuary went to free Misty's still-chained leg a mere day after she'd arrived, she stood peaceably by, practically offering her leg up to him. Over her many months of quarantine, meanwhile, with only humans acting as a kind of surrogate elephant family, she has consistently gone through the daily rigors of her tuberculosis treatments -- involving two caregivers, a team of veterinarians and the use of a restraining chute in which harnesses are secured about her chest and tail -- without any coaxing or pressure. \"We'll shower her with praise in the barn afterwards,\" Buckley told me as Misty stood by, chomping on a mouthful of hay, \"and she actually purrs with pleasure. The whole barn vibrates.\"\nOf course, Misty's road to recovery -- when viewed in light of her history and that of all the other captive elephants, past and present -- is as harrowing as it is heartening. She and the others have suffered, we now understand, not simply because of us, but because they are, by and large, us. If as recently as the end of the Vietnam War people were still balking at the idea that a soldier, for example, could be physically disabled by a psychological harm -- the idea, in other words, that the mind is not an entity apart from the body and therefore just as woundable as any limb -- we now find ourselves having to make an equally profound and, for many, even more difficult leap: that a fellow creature as ostensibly unlike us in every way as an elephant is as precisely and intricately woundable as we are. And while such knowledge naturally places an added burden upon us, the keepers, that burden is now being greatly compounded by the fact that sudden violent outbursts like Misty's can no longer be dismissed as the inevitable isolated revolts of a restless few against the constraints and abuses of captivity.\nThey have no future without us. The question we are now forced to grapple with is whether we would mind a future without them, among the more mindful creatures on this earth and, in many ways, the most devoted. Indeed, the manner of the elephants' continued keeping, their restoration and conservation, both in civil confines and what's left of wild ones, is now drawing the attention of everyone from naturalists to neuroscientists. Too much about elephants, in the end -- their desires and devotions, their vulnerability and tremendous resilience -- reminds us of ourselves to dismiss out of hand this revolt they're currently staging against their own dismissal. And while our concern may ultimately be rooted in that most human of impulses -- the preservation of our own self-image -- the great paradox about this particular moment in our history with elephants is that saving them will require finally getting past ourselves; it will demand the ultimate act of deep, interspecies empathy.\nOn a more immediate, practical level, as Gay Bradshaw sees it, this involves taking what has been learned about elephant society, psychology and emotion and inculcating that knowledge into the conservation schemes of researchers and park rangers. This includes doing things like expanding elephant habitat to what it used to be historically and avoiding the use of culling and translocations as conservation tools. \"If we want elephants around,\" Bradshaw told me, \"then what we need to do is simple: learn how to live with elephants. In other words, in addition to conservation, we need to educate people how to live with wild animals like humans used to do, and to create conditions whereby people can live on their land and live with elephants without it being this life-and-death situation.\"\nThe other part of our newly emerging compact with elephants, however, is far more difficult to codify. It requires nothing less than a fundamental shift in the way we look at animals and, by extension, ourselves. It requires what Bradshaw somewhat whimsically refers to as a new \"trans-species psyche,\" a commitment to move beyond an anthropocentric frame of reference and, in effect, be elephants. Two years ago, Bradshaw wrote a paper for the journal Society and Animals, focusing on the work of the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust in Kenya, a sanctuary for orphaned and traumatized wild elephants -- more or less the wilderness-based complement to Carol Buckley's trauma therapy at the Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee. The trust's human caregivers essentially serve as surrogate mothers to young orphan elephants, gradually restoring their psychological and emotional well being to the point at which they can be reintroduced into existing wild herds. The human \"allomothers\" stay by their adopted young orphans' sides, even sleeping with them at night in stables. The caregivers make sure, however, to rotate from one elephant to the next so that the orphans grow fond of all the keepers. Otherwise an elephant would form such a strong bond with one keeper that whenever he or she was absent, that elephant would grieve as if over the loss of another family member, often becoming physically ill itself.\nTo date, the Sheldrick Trust has successfully rehabilitated more than 60 elephants and reintroduced them into wild herds. A number of them have periodically returned to the sanctuary with their own wild-born calves in order to reunite with their human allomothers and to introduce their offspring to what -- out on this uncharted frontier of the new \"trans-species psyche\" -- is now being recognized, at least by the elephants, it seems, as a whole new subspecies: the human allograndmother. \"Traditionally, nature has served as a source of healing for humans,\" Bradshaw told me. \"Now humans can participate actively in the healing of both themselves and nonhuman animals. The trust and the sanctuary are the beginnings of a mutually benefiting interspecies culture.\"\nOn my way back to New York via London, I contacted Felicity de Zulueta, a psychiatrist at Maudsley Hospital in London who treats victims of extreme trauma, among them former child soldiers from the Lord's Resistance Army. De Zulueta, an acquaintance of Eve Abe's, grew up in Uganda in the early 1960's on the outskirts of Queen Elizabeth National Park, near where her father, a malaria doctor, had set up camp as part of a malaria-eradication program. For a time she had her own elephant, orphaned by poaching, that local villagers had given to her father, who brought it home to the family garage, where it immediately bonded with an orphan antelope and dog already residing there.\n\"He was doing fine,\" de Zulueta told me of the pet elephant. \"My mother was loving it and feeding it, and then my parents realized, How can we keep this elephant that is going to grow bigger than the garage? So they gave it to who they thought were the experts. They sent him to the Entebbe Zoo, and although they gave him all the right food and everything, he was a lonely little elephant, and he died. He had no attachment.\"\nFor de Zulueta, the parallel that Abe draws between the plight of war orphans, human and elephant, is painfully apt, yet also provides some cause for hope, given the often startling capacity of both animals for recovery. She told me that one Ugandan war orphan she is currently treating lost all the members of his family except for two older brothers. Remarkably, one of those brothers, while serving in the Ugandan Army, rescued the younger sibling from the Lord's Resistance Army; the older brother's unit had captured the rebel battalion in which his younger brother had been forced to fight.\nThe two brothers eventually made their way to London, and for the past two years, the younger brother has been going through a gradual process of recovery in the care of Maudsley Hospital. Much of the rehabilitation, according to de Zulueta, especially in the early stages, relies on the basic human trauma therapy principles now being applied to elephants: providing decent living quarters, establishing a sense of safety and of attachment to a larger community and allowing freedom of choice. After that have come the more complex treatments tailored to the human brain's particular cognitive capacities: things like reliving the original traumatic experience and being taught to modulate feelings through early detection of hyperarousal and through breathing techniques. And the healing of trauma, as de Zulueta describes it, turns out to have physical correlatives in the brain just as its wounding does.\n\"What I say is, we find bypass,\" she explained. \"We bypass the wounded areas using various techniques. Some of the wounds are not healable. Their scars remain. But there is hope because the brain is an enormous computer, and you can learn to bypass its wounds by finding different methods of approaching life. Of course there may be moments when something happens and the old wound becomes unbearable. Still, people do recover. The boy I've been telling you about is 18 now, and he has survived very well in terms of his emotional health and capacities. He's a lovely, lovely man. And he's a poet. He writes beautiful poetry.\"\nOn the afternoon in July that I left the Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee, Carol Buckley and Scott Blais seemed in particularly good spirits. Misty was only weeks away from the end of her quarantine, and she would soon be able to socialize with some of her old cohorts from the Hawthorn Corporation: eight female Asians that had been given over to the sanctuary. I would meet the lot of them that day, driving from one to the next on the back of Buckley's four-wheeler across the sanctuary's savanna-like stretches. Buckley and Blais refer to them collectively as the Divas.\nBuckley and Blais told me that they got word not long ago of a significant breakthrough in a campaign of theirs to get elephants out of entertainment and zoos: the Bronx Zoo, one of the oldest and most formidable zoos in the country, had announced that upon the death of the zoo's three current elephant inhabitants, Patty, Maxine and Happy, it would phase out its elephant exhibit on social-behavioral grounds -- an acknowledgment of a new awareness of the elephant's very particular sensibility and needs. \"They're really taking the lead,\" Buckley told me. \"Zoos don't want to concede the inappropriateness of keeping elephants in such confines. But if we as a society determine that an animal like this suffers in captivity, if the information shows us that they do, hey, we are the stewards. You'd think we'd want to do the right thing.\"\nFour days later, I received an e-mail message from Gay Bradshaw, who consults with Buckley and Blais on their various stress-therapy strategies. She wrote that one of the sanctuary's elephants, an Asian named Winkie, had just killed a 36-year-old female assistant caretaker and critically injured the male caretaker who'd tried to save her.\nPeople who work with animals on a daily basis can tell you all kinds of stories about their distinct personalities and natures. I'd gotten, in fact, an elaborate breakdown from Buckley and Blais on the various elephants at the sanctuary and their sociopolitical maneuverings within the sanctuary's distinct elephant culture, and I went to my notebook to get a fix again on Winkie. A 40-year-old, 7,600-pound female from Burma, she came to the sanctuary in 2000 from the Henry Vilas Zoo in Madison, Wisc., where she had a reputation for lashing out at keepers. When Winkie first arrived at the sanctuary, Buckley told me, she used to jump merely upon being touched and then would wait for a confrontation. But when it never came, she slowly calmed down. \"Has never lashed out at primary keepers,\" my last note on Winkie reads, \"but has at secondary ones.\"\nBradshaw's e-mail message concludes: \"A stunning illustration of trauma in elephants. The indelible etching.\"\nI thought back to a moment in Queen Elizabeth National Park this past June. As Nelson Okello and I sat waiting for the matriarch and her calf to pass, he mentioned to me an odd little detail about the killing two months earlier of the man from the village of Katwe, something that, the more I thought about it, seemed to capture this particularly fraught moment we've arrived at with the elephants. Okello said that after the man's killing, the elephant herd buried him as it would one of its own, carefully covering the body with earth and brush and then standing vigil over it.\nEven as we're forcing them out, it seems, the elephants are going out of their way to put us, the keepers, in an ever more discomfiting place, challenging us to preserve someplace for them, the ones who in many ways seem to regard the matter of life and death more devoutly than we. In fact, elephant culture could be considered the precursor of our own, the first permanent human settlements having sprung up around the desire of wandering tribes to stay by the graves of their dead. \"The city of the dead,\" as Lewis Mumford once wrote, \"antedates the city of the living.\"\nWhen a group of villagers from Katwe went out to reclaim the man's body for his family's funeral rites, the elephants refused to budge. Human remains, a number of researchers have observed, are the only other ones that elephants will treat as they do their own. In the end, the villagers resorted to a tactic that has long been etched in the elephant's collective memory, firing volleys of gunfire into the air at close range, finally scaring the mourning herd away.\nCharles Siebert, a contributing writer, is at work on \"Humanzee,\" a book about humans and chimpanzees.",

    "text": "What\u2019s Wrong With Profit?\n2006-11-13T05:00:00.000Z\nCorrection Appended\nTHIS year, as never before, the line between philanthropy and business is blurring. A new generation of philanthropists has stepped forward, for the most part young billionaires who have reaped the benefits of capitalism and believe that it can be applied in the service of charity. They are \u201cphilanthropreneurs,\u201d driven to do good and have their profit, too.\nAmong them are eBay\u2019s founder, Pierre Omidyar, who wants to use investment capital as well as donations to expand the microloan industry, and Stephen M. Case, the co-founder of America Online, who is investing $250 million in companies that help consumers gain control of their health care. \nYoung companies are involved, too: when Google announced its philanthropic effort this year, it unveiled a venture-capital fund rather than a foundation.\n The approach of these philanthropreneurs reflects the culture of the business that brought them their wealth: information technology, with its ethos that everyone should have access to information. By their way of thinking, the marketplace can have the same level-the-playing-field impact, and supply the world\u2019s poor with basic needs like food, sanitation and shelter. \n\u201cMore and more people are asking who else is going to finance doing good if government isn\u2019t,\u201d said Alan Abramson, director of the nonprofit sector and philanthropy program at the Aspen Institute, a public policy think tank in Washington. \u201cThese guys have firsthand knowledge of the market\u2019s power, and they\u2019re asking themselves why they can\u2019t make money and tackle some of the problems once addressed primarily by government at the same time.\u201d\n It sounds simple, but the idea of such hybrid philanthropy is upsetting long-held conventions. These new philanthropists view the current foundation model, built on the fortunes of earlier industrial titans like Carnegie and Rockefeller, as hidebound and often ineffective. They have an urge to change the world, and argue that in some cases only the speed of capitalism is fast enough.\n \u201cWe need to be open to bigger, bolder reform because the hard truth is Philanthropy 1.0 hasn\u2019t worked well enough,\u201d Mr. Case told a group of foundation executives in January. \u201cIf you\u2019ll forgive the computer metaphors, our system needs an upgrade.\u201d\nAn upgrade had been in the works courtesy of Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, who had already leveraged the power of the information technology industry in creating the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, with its tens of billions of dollars in assets from him and, more recently, from the investor Warren E. Buffett. The Gates Foundation has led the way in focusing on problems of the underdeveloped world, like disease. But its impact is as much from its size as its way of doing business: it is mostly a traditional philanthropy, writ large.\nWhat the philanthropreneurs have in mind is something different, and it is producing some confusion, as evidenced by an exchange in September on \u201cLate Show With David Letterman\u201d between Mr. Letterman and Ted Turner, the founder of CNN and a man who knows something about melding business and philanthropy.\nMr. Letterman asked his guest about a plan announced earlier that day by another philanthropreneur, Sir Richard Branson, to \u201cdonate,\u201d as Mr. Letterman put it, $3 billion to develop greener fuels.\nMr. Turner cut him off: \u201cIt\u2019s not a donation.\u201d\nRather, he said, it was an investment. \u201cHe\u2019s probably going to make more off that investment than he has in everything else,\u201d he said.\nExperts in philanthropy are not so confused, but they are not bowled over, either \u2014 at least not yet. \n \u201cI come at this from at least a wonderment of what are the advantages the melded or hybrid model brings,\u201d said Mark Rosenman, a professor at the Union Institute and University in Cincinnati and an expert on nonprofit matters. \u201cThough I have no problem with philanthropy and socially responsible business being joined, I do have one with a for-profit enterprise being called philanthropy.\u201d\n \u201cI see no clear reasons to begin to develop corporate structures that need to consider themselves more closely aligned with philanthropic purposes,\u201d Mr. Rosenman added.\n He said such structures already exist, citing businesses like the Body Shop, which uses its stores and products to inform consumers about human rights and environmental issues and trades with indigenous peoples for supplies and materials.\n Mr. Case points to the National Geographic Society, a nonprofit group that is sustained by sales of everything from magazines to toys. \n\u201cIt has basically become a billion-dollar business set up as a nonprofit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to focus on collecting money or holding black-tie balls to raise money because its sales are sustaining its mission of educating the world about the world.\u201d\nSo far, there is little criticism of the hybrid proponents, perhaps because they seem to have little interest in capitalizing on the tax benefits of their philanthropy. Google, for example, will pay taxes should its new fund produce returns, and Mr. Omidyar foregoes about $1 million in tax benefits by mixing his philanthropy with business.\nMr. Turner is a relatively old hand at ground-breaking philanthropy, having stunned the world in 1997 with a $1 billion pledge to the United Nations, the largest single pledge ever at the time. But he shares the philanthropreneurs\u2019 impatience with the lines drawn by legal, regulatory and tax regimes between business and philanthropy.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way you can invest in polio vaccines and make money,\u201d he said. \u201cBut developing solar panels, that has profit potential and it\u2019s good for the environment. Certain areas of making the world better do lend themselves very comfortably to for-profit operations. Why should we be afraid of that?\u201d \nHere are profiles of four who are not afraid.\nJeffrey S. Skoll\n Almost every philanthropreneur starts with a foundation, and Jeffrey S. Skoll, the 41-year-old former president of eBay, was no exception. He worked on the creation of the eBay Foundation, which introduced him to a \u201ccertain breed of nonprofit leader that really appealed to me,\u201d and creating a foundation to back them with his own money just made sense, Mr. Skoll said.\n \u201cI had gone from living in a house with five other guys and eating leftovers to all of a sudden having financial resources beyond belief,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seemed like a good way to put it to productive use.\u201d\n He said his dream as a youth was to become a writer who would inspire people and inform them about the world\u2019s problems, but he got sidetracked and became a billionaire instead. So he created the Skoll Foundation in 1999 and over time has put $613 million into it, some $90 million of which has been committed to social entrepreneurs and their nonprofits, like the Institute for OneWorld Health, a nonprofit drug company, and KickStart, a nonprofit business that develops low-tech agricultural machines.\nA year later, he started a personal investment fund, Capricorn, and in 2004, he started a film production company, Participant, that has quickly gained prominence for films like \u201cSyriana,\u201d \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck\u201d and \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth.\u201d\n He also has a social networking affiliate, participate.net, which offers users ways to participate in various social movements by helping them send letters to Congress, obtain coupons for low-energy lighting and compare the fuel efficiency of cars, among other things.\n \u201cThe heart of eBay, what made it so successful, wasn\u2019t so much the buying and the selling, which was its economic side, but the facilitation of these relationships in its public forums and question-and-answer areas,\u201d Mr. Skoll said. \u201cI think these days, people want to join with other people to make change. It\u2019s about leverage.\u201d\n His nonprofit and for-profit ventures leverage and support each other in the same way. \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth\u201d examines global warming and climate change, and his foundation supports Ceres, a nonprofit group that works to persuade investors to factor environmental stewardship into their analysis of businesses.\n Through Capricorn, Mr. Skoll has invested in Falcon Waterfree Technologies, maker of a waterless urinal and known among the Skoll entities as the \u201cyuck investment.\u201d Falcon says that one of its urinals saves 40,000 gallons of water a year and reduces wastewater treatment costs. The urinals can be found everywhere from schools in Florida to the Taj Mahal in India.\n \u201cThe idea is that everything, all the resources I have, go into doing good,\u201d Mr. Skoll said. \u201cUltimately, most of the money I make through Capricorn or Participant will go to the foundation, but in the meantime, there\u2019s no reason they can\u2019t do good, too.\u201d\n Stephen M. Case\nOne would think Stephen M. Case, who is 48, would avoid anything blended or hybrid after the experience he had as part of the team that knit America Online and Time Warner together, one of the messiest mergers in corporate history.\n But he has become one of the biggest proponents of hybrid philanthropy. \u201cI think where the lines blur is where it\u2019s most interesting,\u201d Mr. Case said.\n The Case Foundation recently put $5 million into PlayPumps International, a nonprofit group that has developed a new approach to increasing access to clean water in African villages. In a nutshell, a merry-go-round installed in a schoolyard pumps water from the ground into a holding tank, and families draw water from the tank.\n Like any charity, PlayPumps raises money to buy the equipment. Governments contribute by handing over boreholes and wells. A for-profit company, Roundabout Outdoors, places ads on the sides of the water tanks, which generates the money needed to maintain the system.\n \u201cThere have been many well-intentioned projects related to water in Africa, but what typically happens is that after the initial investment is made, no money comes in to sustain them and they break down and that\u2019s that,\u201d Mr. Case said. \u201cIf all PlayPumps did was install 10 million water pumps by 2020, it would be a great accomplishment, but we\u2019ve gone the extra step and created Roundabout to build a revenue stream that will ensure those pumps keep working.\u201d\nSeeking to replicate the model in another area, he founded Revolution in 2005. Its mission is to invest in companies that give consumers more choice and control over everything from health care to car ownership.\nOne such company is FlexCar, which links consumers who want to share a car rather than own one. A member signs up for one of FlexCar\u2019s plans and then can reserve a car for pick-up at a specific time and place. Started in 1999 as a public-private partnership involving the city of Seattle and King County, Wash., FlexCar has expanded to Portland, Ore.; San Francisco; Los Angeles; San Diego; Washington, D.C.; and Atlanta.\n The attractions for Mr. Case are twofold. FlexCar gives consumers an alternative to car ownership at the same time it helps reduce traffic, pollution and energy consumption.\n The company is turning a profit in its most-established markets, and revenues are growing, according to a spokesman for Mr. Case. \n Then there is Accelerate Brain Cancer Cure, or abc2, a nonprofit the Case family started six years ago in hopes of accelerating research to find a cure for brain cancer, which killed his brother Daniel in 2002. Abc2 has underwritten research on brain cancer therapies and fostered collaboration between researchers, companies and government. \n Mr. Case has also created a venture capital fund, Braintrust Accelerator, to invest in companies working to develop brain cancer cures. A share of any profits it realizes will go to abc2.\n \u201cI\u2019m aiming for a more flexible tool box, not just looking at things through the prism of philanthropy or the prism of business but a fresh creative approach that uses the best of both,\u201d Mr. Case said.\nPierre Omidyar\nPierre Omidyar is just 39, but in some ways, he is the granddaddy of philanthropreneurs. \nDissatisfied with the momentum and impact of money he distributed through a traditional foundation created in 1999, Mr. Omidyar all but yanked the plug on it in 2004, when he started the Omidyar Network. The Network is the vehicle through which he runs his for-profit investments and nonprofit gifts, as well as a place where the online public can network.\n \u201cWe tried what I would call active philanthropy, where we were working through the foundation with nonprofits to improve their ability to execute, provide guidance, help with professional development,\u201d Mr. Omidyar said, \u201cand we learned a lot of lessons, some good and some not so good.\u201d\n As he worked through that process, he began to see eBay and the 200 million people using it in a new way. \n\u201cI could see regular people coming in and saying, \u2018eBay changed my life because now I feel I contribute to the household\u2019s finances,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Omidyar said. \u201cThere was a sense of empowerment even in those early days, and it increasingly became clear to me that eBay has had a huge social impact in the process of running its core business, and it wasn\u2019t a philanthropy.\u201d\n He has turned his foundation into a roughly $200 million fund to invest in nonprofit ventures and paired it with a similar amount of money dedicated to investment in for-profit ventures. About $21 million in philanthropic money has been invested so far in organizations like Rare, which trains local conservationists around the globe who it hopes to link online, and Youth Noise, a social network for young people interested in social causes.\n While those organizations are structured as charities, in many cases they are similar in feel to some of the companies in which the Omidyar Network has made investments, like Prosper, an online person-to-person lending business, and the Enthusiast Group, which works to build online communities of fans of sports and other activities.\n Nowhere is the distinction between Mr. Omidyar\u2019s for-profit and nonprofit activities more muted than in the area of microfinance, where he has invested more than $33 million, half of it philanthropic. \n \u201cIf you look at the Grameen Bank, that is a business, you can\u2019t call it anything else,\u201d he said, referring to the bank that makes small loans to the poor in Bangladesh. \u201cIts revenues are greater than its expenses, and it is tremendously effective in pulling people out of poverty. It is proof that you can have it both ways.\u201d\n In addition to putting $4 million into Grameen\u2019s nonprofit arm, the Grameen Foundation, Omidyar Network has supported nonprofit groups like Unitus, which works to develop microfinance institutions and the International Development Law Institute, for its work on developing law to support the growth of the microfinance industry.\n On the for-profit side, it has invested in BlueOrchard Microfinance Securities, which packages loans made by microfinance institutions and sells them to institutional investors, and the Global Commercial Microfinance Consortium, an investment fund aimed at increasing the ties between banks and microfinance groups.\n On top of that, Mr. Omidyar and his wife, Pam, gave Tufts University $100 million that must be spent on developing microfinance. Thus, private capital, philanthropic capital and investment capital are directed toward a single over-arching goal, the creation and expansion of microfinance. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to take what a physicist might call a systems-level view and look at how all the sectors, government, business, nonprofit, are interacting and how they can work together for social benefit,\u201d he said.\nSir Richard Branson\nSir Richard Branson, who is 56, has long mixed it up, building his Virgin Group business empire to encompass airlines, cellphones, record stores, credit cards and pet insurance. In that context, his announcement that he would invest $3 billion in the development of alternative fuels was par for the course, right down to the hubbub that surrounded it.\n \u201cWe have two separate arms, Virgin Unite, the charitable foundation, which is pure giving, and then this hybrid thing, which is our venture capital-charitable unit,\u201d Sir Richard said. \u201cIt may be giving, it may not be giving, depending on how things turn out.\u201d\n The promised investment in alternative energy is an example of what that venture-capital unit is doing, deploying the entrepreneurial flair and skills that have made Sir Richard a billionaire to tackle major global issues like poverty and climate change. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s very risky capital, hopefully it won\u2019t be wasted,\u201d he said.\n He considers Virgin Nigeria, the airline he started in 2004 to serve West Africa, another example of such a for-benefit business because, he said, an airline is crucial to wealth creation. \u201cWe may fall flat on our face,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we\u2019re trying to do good and make money.\u201d\n Sir Richard was on the way to Mozambique to explore the possibility of extending the sugar production so abundant across the border in South Africa to that war-scarred country. His idea is to rid the fields of mines planted during Mozambique\u2019s civil war from late 1970s to the early 1990s and plant sugar that could be converted into ethanol, tasks that would in turn put thousands of people to work. \n \u201cThere are number of challenges all rolled in to one, but that\u2019s why I like it,\u201d he said.\n Virgin is also working to create businesses that have the socially beneficial aspects of a charity but produce income to sustain themselves, perhaps with a little help from philanthropy. It has teamed up with Anglo Coal, a subsidiary of the big South African conglomerate, Anglo American PLC, and the United States government, to open a clinic in South Africa that provides basic health care for a fee \u2014 and drugs to treat H.I.V. and AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria free. The hope is that the fees generated will cover the costs of the basic services.\n \u201cThe hospital cost $1.5 million,\u201d Sir Richard said. \u201cIf it saves 60,000 lives, that\u2019s good entrepreneurialism as well as good charity work.\u201d\n He said he would not try to defend Virgin\u2019s efforts from charges that they are really thinly veiled marketing tactics. \n\u201cIf I\u2019m 90 years old and people look to the Virgin brand and say that\u2019s the brand they respect most in the world, I would be happy,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, if we can in my lifetime come up with a fuel that is a clean fuel and does something to help save the world from global warming, that will be good for the brand, something everyone who works for Virgin can be proud of, but it will also be a good thing for world, too.\u201d",

    "text": "The Heartland Dissident\n2006-02-12T05:00:00.000Z\nWith a bluntness that seems habitual -- and more than occasionally strikes fellow Republicans as disloyal -- Senator Chuck Hagel started voicing skepticism about the Bush administration's fixation on Iraq as a place to fight the Global War on Terror more than half a year before the president gave the go-ahead for the assault. What the senator said in public was milder than what he said in private conversations with foreign-policy gurus like Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser in another Bush administration, or his friend Colin Powell, the secretary of state, who thought he still had a chance to steer the administration on a diplomatic course. The Nebraskan wanted to believe Powell but, deep down, felt the White House wasn't going to be diverted from its drive to topple Saddam Hussein. When he rose on the Senate floor that October to explain his vote in favor of the resolution authorizing force -- he'd persuaded himself that his vote might strengthen Powell's hand -- he gave a speech that would have required no editing had he decided to vote against it. What sounded then to the venture's true believers like the scolding of a Cassandra sounds fairly obvious three and a half years later, which is to say that Hagel's words can reasonably be read as prescient: \"How many of us really know and understand Iraq, its country, history, people and role in the Arab world?. . .The American people must be told of the long-term commitment, risk and cost of this undertaking. We should not be seduced by the expectations of dancing in the streets.\" The president had said \"precious little\" about post-Saddam Iraq, which could prove costly, Hagel warned, \"in both American blood and treasure.\"\nAs the months and years wore on, Senator Hagel's public musings on Iraq became less measured, as if his gorge rose a little higher with each day's casualty report. He would say that the White House was out of touch with reality, that the reconstruction effort in Iraq was \"beyond pitiful,\" that he had lost confidence in Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, that we were losing the war and had destabilized the Middle East, that the United States was getting \"bogged down\" in Iraq the way it had been in Vietnam. Some of these observations flew into print during the 2004 presidential race, and one of them, the \"beyond pitiful\" line, was seized upon by John Kerry, the Democratic candidate, in his second debate with President Bush. At the Republican grass roots in Nebraska and in the upper reaches of his party in Washington, the senator's candor was not universally viewed as refreshing. His timing was held against him even more than his dissent. (\"Maybe his criticisms are valid,\" a letter to The Omaha World-Herald said, \"but why showcase them and lend credence to the liberal opposition?\") Obviously, this was not a team player. Some of his closest friends and supporters fretted that he was killing whatever small chance he might have had to be the national candidate he plainly aspired to be. Now -- 33 months before a presidential election, two years before the first primaries -- his chances aren't merely discounted; he's seldom even mentioned in Republican circles, as if he has been sidelined by his independence on Iraq.\nThe fact that Hagel himself emerged with two Purple Hearts from Vietnam, where he served as an enlisted man in the infantry, has often been mentioned in news reports quoting him on Iraq as if memories, or maybe nightmares, dating back to the war from which he still carried bits of shrapnel in his chest were primary and extenuating factors shaping his seemingly irrepressible utterances on the latest intervention, his regular brushes with apostasy. Compelling as it is, Chuck Hagel's history as an ordinary soldier, a grunt from small-town Middle America who grew up to be a senator, is more layered, less simple. Unlike Senator Kerry, he had never been a Vietnam veteran against the war. Unlike his own younger brother Tom -- with whom, against standard Army practice on exposing brothers to risk, he walked point in the same infantry unit -- he supported that war to the bitter end. The brothers continued to argue about it for another 25 years until the older one's experience of the world as a globetrotting businessman and his autodidact forays into history and foreign-policy discourse brought him to more or less the same place that Tom (now a law professor in Dayton, Ohio, and a Democrat) had reached in instant, visceral reaction to the experience of jungle war.\nChuck Hagel never became a dove, but he became a bird that's nearly as rare in the Republican aviary. He became an internationalist, someone who's capable of feeling intensely about alliances, multilateral endeavors, the value of global institutions; a fellow traveler of the Council on Foreign Relations, a politician who actually reads Foreign Affairs. A singular Great Plains Republican, in other words, who cares about the rest of the world for reasons that don't begin and end with agricultural exports. Tellingly, when he was elected to the Senate in 1996, he was the one new Republican whose first choice for a committee assignment was the Foreign Relations Committee, which had declined steadily in prestige since the Vietnam-era days of a Democratic chairman he sometimes mentions as a role model, J. William Fulbright. An instinctive and unwavering conservative on most issues -- in particular, big government and deficits -- he was the antithesis of a neocon, a profile to which The Weekly Standard paid backhanded tribute in 2002 when it included him (along with Powell, Scowcroft and The New York Times) in what it called \"the axis of appeasement.\" In the cruelest cut, in that brief period of easy, triumphalist anticipation before the invasion and its turbulent aftermath, National Review put Nebraska's senior senator down as Senator Hagel (R., France).\nIf his tendency to fall out of step with the administration and to ignore talking points sent around by the Republican National Committee has been most conspicuous on foreign affairs, he has been just as much his own man on domestic issues. (\"Nothing in my oath of office,\" he recently told reporters, \"says, 'I pledge allegiance to the Republican Party and President Bush.' \") The senator from Nebraska broke with his party leadership to vote against the new prescription-drug program under Medicare, the No Child Left Behind bill and a big farm bill stuffed with incentives for corporate agriculture. Each, he felt, was ill conceived in practical terms and unwarranted as an expansion of federal mandates and spending. Only on the Bush tax cuts -- all of which he has supported -- has he been deaf to warnings about the consequences for the federal deficit. (Though, he says, he'd never take \"the pledge\" to oppose any and all tax hikes.)\nIt can be argued, as David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union, pointed out, that Hagel has taken a more conservative position than the Bush administration every time he has broken with it on a major issue. Keene's outfit gave the senator a 100 percent rating for his votes in 2003. His lifetime rating for his first eight years in the Senate stood at 85 on the union's scorecard, which translates into baseball talk as better than a .300 batting average. Here's a certified conservative, then, who has regularly decried partisanship -- even during the do-or-die Florida showdown in 2000, when he suggested a statewide recount -- and doesn't go on about \"values.\" (He has them; most people have them, he says, so seeking to impose one's own values on others isn't right.) A regular churchgoer, an Episcopalian who sends his two children to Catholic school, he thinks religion is a private matter. In today's partisan climate, what are so-called movement conservatives to make of such a man? Facing conservative audiences, he struggles to overcome the suspicion that he's unpredictable, a throwback to old-school G.O.P. moderation, a dissident.\nThat suspicion isn't altogether baseless. Hagel is typically more interested in facts on the ground than doctrine. For instance, while he's reliably anti-abortion -- earning a legislative rating of 100 from the Christian Coalition in 2004 -- he's ready to think through an issue that's a litmus test for some religious groups without bothering to figure out what it might cost him. I asked whether he, like the Bush administration, resisted assistance to groups that distribute condoms in the fight against AIDS in Africa. The senator didn't have a potted answer, so I got to watch him think. He said he thought the United States should be careful about the conditions it lays down; he also had no problem with contraception, he said. As far as I could tell, the answer had come through unfiltered, without political calculation.\nNone of this easily adds up to a mandate to seek the presidential nomination of the Republican Party, even if you're the senator and happen to believe strongly that the party has lost its way at home and abroad. Hagel leaves no doubt that this is how he feels, even when he's trying to hold in check the reflexive, often surprising directness that makes him a favorite on Sunday-morning TV gab shows. (\"I sometimes question whether I'm in the same party I started off in,\" he will say. Or, \"This party that sometimes I don't recognize anymore has presided over the largest growth of government in the history of this country and maybe even the history of man.\") Though he can be scathing about the Bush administration's policies, he almost always avoids direct criticism of the president (except to express astonishment that a Republican could go five years without vetoing a single spending bill). He also doesn't praise him.\nThe problem with making a revival of old-time values of fiscal restraint at home and restraint in the use of American power abroad the starting point for a race is that it presumes a level of disillusion that latter-day Republicans -- the people who'll vote in primaries in 2008 -- show little sign of feeling. Even when George W. Bush was bottoming out in national polls, Republicans gave him a favorability rating of about 80 percent. Nevertheless, Chuck Hagel is still thinking hard about running, even though party professionals place him at the back of the pack; even though running would more than likely entail standing against John McCain, whom he supported in 2000, one of only four senators to do so, and his closest neighbor in the Russell Senate Office Building. McCain, a former naval officer who calls Hagel \"Sergeant,\" is not only another Vietnam vet and therefore a soul mate, he's also the member of the Republican caucus, Hagel will say even now, who has the best shot at giving the party a new direction and balance. But, among other things, they've differed on Iraq.\nBefore he can worry about potential rivals, Hagel says, he has to look into himself to see if he has the mettle and ideas needed to offset the disadvantages that make also-rans of senators who discover their Washington experience and voting records only handicap them when they go up against fresh-faced governors able to boast that they're not part of the problem. A veteran of previous administrations who's in fairly regular touch with the senator said he admired him for his seriousness and \"brain power,\" his fresh and independent approach to the toughest issues in foreign affairs especially, but hadn't yet detected the \"single-minded zeal\" that marks successful candidates for the highest office. Judged as a possible president, the former official said, Hagel could be considered impressive, but judged as a possible candidate, he seemed \"basically a dilettante.\"\nMichael McCarthy, an Omaha merchant banker who once made Chuck Hagel president of his investment bank and is now among his most stalwart backers, said he doubted that Hagel could get very far in presidential politics. But he didn't rule out a race. \"Chuck's a complicated guy,\" he said. \"He thinks with the clarity of an actuary but decides with the heart of an Irishman, so I don't know where at the end of the day he'll land. He sure as hell can overcome doubt and decide to go where his heart tells him to.\"\nThe issue that could propel him into the campaign is not one on which candidacies normally rise or fall. Call it the issue of competence. Hagel is a small-government man who believes government can be made to work, that it should be managed well. And while he doesn't exactly say that the current administration has been careless and incompetent, that theme cries out between the lines of much of what he does say. After the botched reconstruction of Iraq and the nonchalant response to the hurricane on the Gulf Coast, it's not a stretch to hear an implied critique when he says, as he did talking to local reporters in Ames, Iowa, last fall, that the president should \"stay focused on governing the country\" and \"reach out to Congress.\" It was a polite way of saying the president had done neither. Later, in an interview in his Senate office, I asked how he thought history would judge George W. Bush. He said it would be \"rather harsh\" if things continued for the next three years the way they've gone for the last five. The verdict would depend on Iraq, \"on what happens to the deficit and the debt and some of these issues we've not paid attention to over the last five years.\" His list of \"these things\" is familiar and long, in both foreign and domestic affairs. It includes global warming, an issue Hagel has fastened on ever since sponsoring a Congressional resolution with Senator Robert Byrd, the Democratic elder from West Virginia, that opposed the Kyoto Protocol because it placed no caps on emissions by rising industrial powers like China and India; on climate change, he feels strongly, the Bush White House has muffed a chance to demonstrate that conservatives can say something more useful than no, that they can actually advance ideas and programs.\nAn earnest legislator who seeks to legislate across a broad range of big, looming issues, Hagel managed to pass a couple of bills that offered corporations loan guarantees and tax breaks to come up with processes and devices that limit greenhouse gases. Unlike the administration, he actually got to the point of drafting a Social Security reform bill. And finding allies across party lines -- Tom Daschle of South Dakota in the last session, Barack Obama of Illinois as well as a fellow Republican, Mel Martinez, in this one -- he shaped a package of immigration-reform bills that aim to create a system that's not dysfunctional: tough on illegals coming into the country, not impossible for illegals who are already here and manageable for employers who want to obey the law. (To understand why a Nebraska senator might interest himself in immigration issues, it's enough to visit an Omaha meatpacking plant. On the cutting floor, the universal language is Spanish.)\n\"Competent Governance\" may not be a slogan to set Republican pulses racing; and pledging to be \"a uniter rather than a divider\" and to be \"humble\" in dealings with the rest of the world are, in any case, themes that have already been tried. Recently, instead of the pallid term \"competence,\" Hagel has been talking about \"competitiveness\" as he tries to find language that will give some urgency to his sense that the party in power, his party, has failed to address issues that are just as urgent as terrorism.\nIt may say something about the politics of \"tending to the base\" that Chuck Hagel appears today to be the longest of long shots, for he's a politician with attributes that are supposedly sought by the people who package candidates and by the casual, least opinionated voters for whom they package them -- those who drift back and forth between parties, actually deciding elections. The packagers like candidates with what in the trade is called \"a good story.\" Hagel's story wouldn't have to be reshaped by an editor in a cutting room. Voters claim they look for someone who comes across as genuine, talks straight, means what he (or, for argument's sake in the coming campaign, she) says, even if they're not in perfect sync with the candidate on issues. Hagel has that quality of going beyond plausibility to believability, possibly to a fault (in that it sometimes comes with a senatorial tendency to tell you more than you wanted to know; a related liability is that he likes to write his own speeches, which he weighs down with lessons of history and high-minded quotations from his reading, as if he feels a need to show how studious he is).\nA Republican campaign pro, after an astute analysis of Hagel's virtues and drawbacks, zeroed in on a factor no one else had mentioned, one that he seemed to feel said a lot about the reason Hagel's party hasn't warmed to him, and therefore about his limited prospects.\n\"He doesn't have a happy face,\" the pro said.\nThat's something a good story -- real life, in other words -- can do to a person.\nIt's not that Chuck Hagel can't flash a smile. I watched him in Iowa patiently pose with members of his audience who lined up to have their pictures snapped. The strain started to show only after seven or eight little flashes. He also laughs easily, at his own jokes and others'. A tireless networker and campaigner who revels in small-town parades, he never seems to need prompting to attach a name to a face. But his gregariousness, the habit of a lifetime, takes concentration. When he's small-talking his way around a room, he seems to lean into conversations; and his fingers are usually working, if not grabbing elbows or patting shoulders, then knitting themselves together or kneading the palms of his hands, as if typing out signals to his brain to remind him he's on stage. If you had to choose a word to describe him at such moments, it might be \"focused,\" even \"conscientious\"; it wouldn't be \"happy.\" Later, while he's waiting to be introduced, his roughly chiseled features may look a little tired or pensive but never less than alert. This is a politician who works at his job.\nThat usually animated, hardly woebegone face has taken more than its share of battering. His nose was broken twice in high school and college football games and at least once more in a fistfight. (There was the fight on a dance floor in Schuyler, Neb., when some players from another school started picking on a pal, and another at a party in Lincoln when he advised some crashers to leave a friend's home.) And there was Vietnam, where the left side of his face was scorched after a mine went off under the armored personnel carrier in which he was riding. Harder to read are the tracings of a difficult childhood, over which Hagel usually drops a kind of scrim to obscure the roughest parts.\nIf he tells the story of his hard-luck dad, who came down with malaria in the Pacific theater, he's apt to leave out the drinking. And if he mentions the binges, it takes some prompting for him to acknowledge the effect on himself, the eldest of four sons. More often he dwells on the conversion of his German-French father -- Charles Dean Hagel, known as Charlie -- to the Roman Catholicism of his Polish-Irish mother and the lead role he then took in building a small church in the town of Ainsworth, where Chuck and Tom became altar boys. Or he humorously turns the fact that the family had homes in seven different small towns that describe a loop around Nebraska into a bountiful political legacy, one that makes it possible for him to say it's good to be home again practically anywhere he campaigns in his state.\nHagel, who will turn 60 this year, was born in North Platte, in western Nebraska, less than a year after his parents were wed, and christened Charles Timothy. They then moved north to Ainsworth, where his dad worked for his own father in a lumberyard, loading and unloading trains. When they couldn't get along, he got himself reassigned to a lumberyard in Rushville, farther west. By then the senator's dad had already been hospitalized twice, for polio and for severe injuries sustained in a fall at the Ainsworth yard. When the family caught up to him in Rushville, he was again in the hospital, this time with a broken back, the result of a car crash when he'd been drinking.\n\"We lived,\" Hagel told me, speaking haltingly, not relishing the details, \"in the basement of this old hotel called the Travelers Hotel in downtown Rushville -- downtown Rushville is like two streets -- and when Dad got out of the hospital, we couldn't find a house. It was like a furnace room. I mean it literally was a furnace room. I mean we had cots down there. It was all dirty. Mice and everything.\" After Rushville came Scotts Bluff, farther west, near the Wyoming border; then Terrytown, just across the Platte River, where his dad would be fired for drinking; then, moving east again, York and the basement of another hotel, the St. Cloud, where young Chuck, by now a freshman in high school, bused tables. \"It was a little better than Rushville,\" he said, \"but not much.\"\nBy then, he was winning notice for his athletic promise and precocious interest in politics. It was 1960, and he was in a Catholic school called St. Joseph's. \"I was the only kid in the school who was for Nixon,\" he said. \"The nuns and priests were wild, just completely wild, for Kennedy, and everyone was very upset with me because I had a picture of Nixon on one of my books.\" It was also about then that he started getting into occasional confrontations with his dad. As he guardedly puts it now, \"Some of it was physical.\" Feeling that he had a responsibility as the eldest, he'd step between his parents when his father, livid with drink, started badgering his mother. I asked whether his dad ever took a swing at him. He paused for a moment, then said, \"Yeh, uh-huh.\" Again he paused. \"Well, you wouldn't swing back at him,\" he went on. \"I'd just push him back.\"\nIn his steadier moments, the father was hugely proud of his eldest son, attending all his games, forecasting a great future for him and seeming not to notice that he was slighting his next in line, Tom, who was not an athlete. At the end of a year in York, the family moved north to Columbus, the easternmost point in its circuit of the state, about 80 miles from Omaha. There his dad had one more drunken smash-up. Then on Christmas morning in 1962, the Hagel boys were startled by the sobbing of their mom, who'd come home from early Mass to find her husband dead in bed at 39 of a heart attack. Chuck, just 16, imagined he had to fill the void.\nn the five years between his dad's death and his departure for Vietnam, the new man of the family was sturdy, attentive to his brothers and rudderless in his own life. His first goal, set by a football scholarship to Wayne State College, was thwarted early on when an injury left him with a pinched nerve in his neck that surgery couldn't correct. He then drifted to the University of Nebraska at Kearney (pronounced Carney) and from there, dropping out on a sudden impulse, to a school of broadcasting in Minneapolis, where he tried to support himself by going door to door near the airport, in an attempt to sign up United Airlines stewardesses for the Encyclopedia Britannica. It would be a smart investment, he'd tell them, for the children they didn't yet have. \"Well, I did make some sales,\" the senator said.\nWhen his number came up at the draft board in January 1967, he went willingly. And when, after training, he received orders to go to Germany, he requested a transfer to Vietnam. He hadn't been touched by anti-war protests. Where he came from, the feeling was that if there was a war on, that's where a young American soldier belonged. In that reflex, which many would still call patriotic, he briefly found a purpose.\nIt's unclear to the two brothers today how they wound up in the same infantry squad. Tom, drafted as soon as he finished high school, went initially to a reconnaissance unit up north, where he saw heavy fighting. He put in for a transfer, hoping to get closer to his brother, who was serving in the south. Soon they were on patrol together in canopied jungle near the Cambodian border. Over a period of about four weeks, each got a chance to save the other's life. When the first incident occurred, on March 28, 1968, their squad leader had just taken them off point and moved them to the middle of the column. One of the soldiers who replaced them hit a trip wire, setting off a mine that had been placed in a tree so that it would detonate at face level. Bodies, body parts and shrapnel were blasted back into the ranks as the squad was crossing a stream. Tom picked himself up and looked for his brother. What he saw, he says, was a \"geyser\" of blood gushing from Chuck's chest. Tom, then only 19, stanched the bleeding and bandaged the wound, only then noticing that he'd been hit himself in the arm. By the time the medevac choppers had taken off the dead and critically wounded, the Hagel boys were deemed well enough to continue on, which meant going off the booby-trapped trail and hacking through thick undergrowth.\nTwenty-five days later, it was Chuck's turn to rescue Tom, when their troop carrier hit a hand-detonated mine as it emerged from a village in the delta. Tom had been in the turret behind a .50-caliber machine gun. He was unconscious, not obviously alive, when his brother got to him. The blast had blown out Chuck's eardrums and severely burned his left side, but knowing the carrier might soon explode, he worked feverishly to pull Tom from the wreckage, then threw his body on top of Tom's as Vietcong fighters in ambush sprayed the area with gunfire.\nChuck left Vietnam in December 1968, Tom the following February. Back in Omaha, they roomed together for a time, then followed separate paths to readjustment to civilian life. Beset by nightmares and feelings of guilt that sent him off on binges, Tom had the most to get over, what seemed to be the harder time. He also had the clearest idea about the war, which seemed to him futile and cruel. Before they could get used to their new lives, their youngest brother, Jimmy, was killed in a car crash at 16, yet another piece of Hagel hard luck.\nIn his reaction to all he'd been through, Hagel mixed repression and a fierce focus on the future. He would do his best to put the war out of his mind, get through his studies finally -- he was in his third college -- and move on. \"I was probably going through something that I didn't quite understand,\" he acknowledges. \"I don't think I'm a person who doesn't reflect, because I do -- I reflect on a lot of things -- but in this case I wanted to get it behind me. . .I wanted a life.\" It happened relatively fast. Working part time as a radio reporter in Omaha, he interviewed the only Republican on the county board, John Y. McCollister, who then was elected to the House of Representatives when Hagel was about to graduate, finally, from the University of Nebraska at Omaha. The young veteran asked the new congressman for help finding a Washington job. A month later, McCollister and his wife invited their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to stay in their home. Soon his boss was bringing him coffee in bed in the mornings and driving him to work. A year and a half after that, Hagel was his chief of staff, at 26.\n\"It wasn't very long before he knew everyone on Capitol Hill,\" McCollister told me. \"That's the history of Chuck Hagel. He meets people easily.\" The subsequent lines on Hagel's dense r\u00e9sum\u00e9 had everything to do with this talent for getting to know people.\nWithin 10 years, as Ronald Reagan swept into the White House, he was well-enough connected in Republican circles to be made the second-ranking official of the Veterans Administration. In that capacity, he turned up as one of the main speakers at the groundbreaking for the Vietnam War Memorial. Five months later, in what might be seen as his first declaration of independence, he quit in open protest against cuts in benefits for Vietnam vets, which he'd resisted unsuccessfully.\nThe resignation opened a new chapter in his life. He would now turn his hand to making money. Cashing in his life-insurance policies and selling his car to his mother and stepfather, he managed to raise $5,000, enough to make him a partner in a batch of new companies that would compete in a lottery for licenses to set up systems for a new kind of telephone that worked without wires. The company he helped found, after stock swaps and the arrival of new partners, grew up into Vanguard Cellular Systems. By the time it went public in 1988, it had become one of the country's biggest cellphone companies, and Chuck Hagel's stake made him a wealthy man. By then he'd traveled to some 15 countries, negotiating with governments, usually unsuccessfully, for contracts to set up wireless systems.\nHe'd also married and remarried. The first marriage lasted less than two years. The Nebraska Catholic then got to know a Mississippi Baptist, Lilibet Ziller, who handled press for the House Veterans' Affairs Committee. Their search for a church where they could both be comfortable led them to St. John's Episcopal Church across from the White House, where they now worship and where their two children were baptized and confirmed. (Hagel realizes that if he were to try a national run, he might be called on to explain his choices in religion to Christian groups that are part of the conservative coalition his party has fused together. He doesn't especially like the idea. \"I don't question or critique any other politician's style, but I know who Chuck Hagel is,\" he said. \"I know what fits me, and I know what fits my wife. Religion is important to us, spirituality is important, but it's also private.\")\nHis financial independence eased his return to the political sphere and made it only a question of time as to when he'd run for office. He toyed briefly with the idea of running for governor of Virginia, then returned to Nebraska in 1992, going to work for Michael McCarthy as an investment banker. One of the companies he looked after, American Information Systems -- later rechristened Election Systems and Software -- manufactured voting machines in partnership with The Omaha World-Herald, the state's biggest daily.\nIt's sometimes said that Nebraska has two Republican parties, one of which calls itself Democrat. That party had won every Senate race for two decades when Hagel started driving from town to town in 1995 to make himself known. In a state with fewer than a million voters, personal contact matters. Dick Robinson, who runs a steel company in the town of Norfolk, said he'd never heard of his visitor when Hagel dropped by to ask for his support. Ten years later, in his skybox at the always-sold-out stadium in Lincoln where the University of Nebraska plays football, Robinson seemed glad to have a distraction from a game the once-indomitable Huskers were giving away to Oklahoma. \"It was great to meet a politician who could look you in the eye and say, 'I disagree,' \" he said. \"We've been fast friends ever since.\"\nalthough their state is one of the two or three most lopsidedly Republican in presidential voting, Nebraskans cling to the notion that their wide open spaces -- populated by nearly four times as many cattle as people -- nurture a spirit of political independence, an indifference to partisanship. Bob Kerrey, a Democrat who couldn't help calling President Clinton \"an unusually good liar,\" is the most recent example. George Norris, a Senate titan for three decades, supported Al Smith in 1928 and Franklin Roosevelt in 1932 against Herbert Hoover while still a Republican, writing an article for Liberty magazine entitled, \"Why I Am a Better Republican Than President Hoover.\"\nChuck Hagel isn't likely to go that far. Having resided full time in Nebraska for only 7 of the last 34 years, he's not apt, in any event, to present himself as a Prairie independent. Viewing himself as a self-made man who started out with nothing besides his own inner resources, he has neither broken with his party nor allowed it to define him. Nor did he wait for his party to decide when it was his turn.\nIn 1996, in his first race, he took on a Republican attorney general in the Senate primary and won by nearly two to one. In the general election, he upset a popular Democratic governor, Ben Nelson, by a margin of 14 percentage points. Realizing too late that he was trailing, Nelson ran attack ads portraying Hagel as a Washington insider who'd used his connections to enrich himself in the cellphone business. Hagel had earlier resisted demands by Alfonse D'Amato of New York, then chairman of the Republican campaign committee in the Senate, that he order up a series of attack ads by a favorite D'Amato demolition specialist.\nStung by Nelson's barrage, Hagel countered with an ad in The Omaha World-Herald calling them \"the most scurrilous and false attacks ever made in Nebraska politics.\" Not the forgiving sort, he has never quite forgotten his grudge against Nelson, who, for the last five years, has been the state's junior senator. Senator Nelson has since been heard to ask how it could be that he managed to get over a big loss while his colleague has yet to get over a big win.\nIn the blogosphere, where conspiracy theories enjoy a certain immortality, the scale of Hagel's upset victories in 1996 made him an object of suspicion after the Florida voting fiasco of 2000. Here was a virtual unknown who'd once been an officer of a company that made the voting machines on which most ballots were cast in Nebraska. But these were scanners, not digital counters; paper ballots survived, available for a recount that neither of his rivals sought. (When he ran for re-election in 2002, he won even bigger, capturing 83 percent of the vote, a Nebraska record. Out on the Web, suspicion lived on.)\nWhat Hagel thought he'd showed in his face-offs with Nelson and D'Amato -- who'd called him a \"prima donna\" (and then some) -- was that heavy reliance on attack ads wasn't a winning strategy. After not quite two years in the Senate, he put himself up for the campaign committee's chairmanship, sending around a manifesto to his colleagues that promised to thin the ranks of consultants as a step toward cleansing \"the political culture in America by 'defining up' the standards of debate, political discourse and campaigns.\" It was a direct challenge to the leadership, which he accused of running \"issueless campaigns.\" And it flopped. His colleagues weren't responsive to his musings on the state of the political culture. They decided that winning was still \"the only thing,\" voting 39-13 in favor of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Not for the last time, Hagel's position was shown to be lonelier than he'd realized.\nHe may not have become a leader of his caucus, but, to the likely dismay of the White House, he's also not an outcast. On a personal level, he's still a man who forges connections. In addition to John McCain, he gets along well with the chairmen of his key committees -- Pat Roberts of Kansas on Intelligence and Richard Lugar of Indiana on Foreign Relations -- and counts Democrats Joe Biden of Delaware and Jack Reed of Rhode Island as among his best friends on the Hill. \"I've been in the Senate a long time, and there's nobody I've liked more than Chuck Hagel,\" Biden told me.\nBy the time of his loss to McConnell, Hagel had nearly persuaded himself that he felt a fresh breeze blowing in the party from Austin, Tex., which he'd visited in April 1998 for a laid-back overnight at the governor's mansion that included a meandering walk through the gardens with his host, a quiet dinner with just George and Laura Bush, then more talk on an upstairs porch. It was the first real encounter between the two and the most time they'd ever spend together.\nHe found Bush \"a very charming, gregarious person,\" and when, several months later, on a swing through Nebraska, he was asked whom he liked as the next Republican nominee, he all but endorsed the Texan, citing his name recognition, success in a big state, age and conservative profile.\nIt proved to be the first time that Bush learned he could not take Chuck Hagel for granted. Before long, John McCain knocked on the Nebraskan's door, divulged his own ambitions and asked his friend to be co-chairman of his campaign. Hagel had to know there were differences in temperament and outlook between himself and McCain, who was more moralistic about international issues, less fascinated by the intricacies of diplomacy, more inclined, perhaps, to brandish military power. But in the Clinton years, these did not loom large. He knew the senator far better than he knew Bush -- who was pretty much a blank on national-security issues anyway -- and admired him, above all, for his readiness to take lonely stands.\nHe was sitting with McCain when the South Carolina primary returns came in following a campaign in which McCain's mental stability was questioned and calls were made to likely Republican voters telling them the former P.O.W. and his wife had a black baby, without mentioning that the little girl had been adopted at an orphanage in Bangladesh. Reached by Don Walton, the respected political reporter of The Lincoln Star Journal, Hagel said Bush had \"sold his soul to the right wing.\" He called it \"the filthiest campaign I've ever seen.\"\n\"I'd say the same thing today,\" he said when I asked about South Carolina, nearly six years later.\nConsidering how he'd disappointed Bush after the attention lavished on him in Austin and what he'd said about South Carolina, it's remarkable that Senator Hagel then found himself on the short list for running mate in 2000. To this day, he doesn't know whether he was seriously in contention. Possibly there was some thought that the former member of the Texas Air National Guard could benefit by picking, or at least appearing to consider, a twice-wounded Vietnam vet. Hagel says he spent $15,000 on accountant fees assembling the information the campaign demanded. Dick Cheney, the chief talent scout, interviewed him twice and sent his son-in-law around to pick up a box of documents before it was discovered that the talent scout was actually the talent.\n\"I still have the box,\" Hagel said. Nothing could be more unanswerable than the question of what might have happened in Iraq had he been picked. It's a testament to the vice president's influence that it even occurs.\nhagel had been to Iraq four times by the time Cheney paid his first visit as vice president in December 2005. Today the war is so much in the front of the senator's mind that it pops into just about any answer he gives to a political question, sometimes more than once. When I asked whether he saw himself as a maverick, his reply boiled down to saying he was a consistent conservative. But here's how it began: \"When I think of issues like Iraq, of how we went into it -- no planning, no preparation, no sense of consequences, of where we were going, how we were going to get out, went in without enough men, no exit strategy, those kind of things -- I'll speak out, I'll go against my party.\"\nA minute later, still chewing on the same question, Hagel was relating the retort of a Nebraska friend to a Republican who'd complained that the senator was still out of step with the president. Pretty much the same litany then tumbled out as, speaking in what was supposed to be the friend's voice, Hagel went on: \"Who's the conservative here? Who votes against the Medicare reform bill, who votes against No Child Left Behind, who votes against the farm bill, who's opposed to invading another country, occupying another country, with no plans, no exit strategy and not enough troops? Now you tell me who the conservative is.\"\nThe trouble with Iraq as an identifying issue for a potential candidate today is that practically everyone except Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and Congressman John Murtha of Pennsylvania, who have flirted with the idea of a deadline for withdrawal, purports to be in essentially the same position with regard to what needs to be happen: hoping that the insurgency will wane, that the Sunnis will somehow be mollified, that the number of U.S. troops can be drawn down this year, that Iraqis will be able to finish the war, more or less on their own. Everyone, for the moment, includes George W. Bush, Hillary Clinton and Chuck Hagel. Some are more hopeful (Bush), and some decidedly less (Hagel). No one now can really know how Iraq will play out in our politics.\nIt's not, in any case, an issue on which Hagel can easily \"position\" himself the way most senators who are not satisfied with being senators would. As this least partisan Republican stews on his decision on whether to go national with his sense of frustration, he has to know that his independence and forthrightness, the qualities that so far have defined him, are also his most obvious limitations in the roughhouse game of presidential politics as we know it. A candidate who worries about the price he may have to pay for anything he says would not have called for active engagement with Iran and Cuba as Hagel has regularly done in foreign-policy speeches over the last several years. And he would probably not be displaying, as Hagel has recently done, a newfound sensitivity on civil liberties matters. Through the end of 2004, Hagel's rating on the legislative scorecard of the American Civil Liberties Union was an anemic 22 percent. But at the end of December, as Congress rushed to adjourn, he was one of only four Republican senators whose votes held up an extension of the Patriot Act, arguing for checks on federal powers to invade homes and private records that had passed the Senate unanimously but then had been dropped in conference.\n\"When government continues to erode individual rights, that's the most dangerous, dangerous threat to freedom there is,\" he said, calling it \"far more dangerous than terrorism.\" His reaction was similarly sharp when he first heard of the report in this newspaper that the president had claimed authority to order domestic wiretapping without court approval. \"If, in fact, this is true,\" he said, \"then it needs to stop.\" When the White House acknowledged it was true, Hagel pressed for Congressional hearings and a national debate. \"I think Congress has failed the country in many ways,\" he said at a forum in California last month. One way was to allow the administration \"to completely overpower the debate based on, 'I'm the commander in chief, and I know what's best.' \"\nAs he road-tests themes for a possible campaign, he argues that his party is running low on ideas for the country's future, so fixated has it been on the threat of terrorism and maintaining itself in power. The importance of terrorism can't be minimized, he hastens to say, but through neglect of research and infrastructure, through failures in education, the country is losing its edge in a competitive world economy. Sure, globalization causes dislocations, this devout free trader and new-economy entrepreneur says, and, sure, the rise of China presents problems, but these are facts of life \"that we are not going to unwind.\" Forty-six years after a senator last made it directly to the White House, he gropes for words in which to talk about national purpose, about a Manhattan Project for alternate energy sources, about getting the country moving again. These themes are in the air; President Bush latched onto them in his State of the Union address in January.\nEarlier in the month, Hagel had already tried them out at a breakfast talk to a conservative group in Orange County, Calif. The breakfast had opened with an invocation in which \"the vision of a former lifeguard called Dutch\" and the American engagement in Iraq had been gratefully cited as part of \"God's plan\" to spread freedom around the globe. That left Hagel sounding a little impious when he gave his cool assessment of the venture on the Euphrates. Iraq may yet work out, he said. \"I don't think it will, but it may.\" But as for the conservative revolution in America, \"Where,\" he asked, \"is Phase 2?\"\nThe audience -- youngish businessfolk who had formed a new political action committee called Atlas, after Ayn Rand's paean to competitiveness, \"Atlas Shrugged\" -- seemed mildly appreciative rather than shocked.\n\"This administration has kept America on such a narrow ledge,\" he remarked after the talk. \"Everything is terrorism.\"\nIn Washington, I asked Senator McCain whether he saw his pal next door as a serious candidate in 2008. The senator, who rode a campaign bus he called the Straight Talk Express in 2000, knows something about the advantages and disadvantages of candor in a national campaign. In this instance he either misconstrued or sidestepped my question. He replied that Hagel was definitely serious, one of the two, three or four leading voices on national security and foreign policy in the Senate. \"Chuck really works at it,\" he said.\nMcCain was an early enthusiast for the war in Iraq, Hagel an early skeptic. Could he imagine the co-chairman of his first national race having a place on a McCain ticket or in a McCain administration? I asked. \"I'd be honored to have Chuck with me in any capacity,\" McCain replied. \"He'd make a great secretary of state.\"\nPropriety and common sense argue that it's too early to place such bets. Hagel isn't ready to have the conversation with McCain that he knows he'll have to have. He's still at the stage of testing audience responses, of looking into faces to see if they give back any hint of encouragement, even recognition. \"Hello,\" he'll say, sticking out his hand to a receptionist or a registration clerk, \"I'm Senator Chuck Hagel.\" He has done it often enough to know that the likely response is a blank stare, but still he persists as he travels beyond Washington and Nebraska, to Los Angeles, New York, Iowa, New Hampshire, even McCain territory -- he had a fund-raiser in Phoenix last month -- trying to identify potential donors and supporters.\nWhatever he concludes, he promises he'll go on saying what he thinks a senator should say about issues as they arise. \"I don't have to be president; I don't have to be a senator,\" he said over dinner in an Omaha steakhouse. \"I have to live with myself.\" More striking than the words was the urgency with which he spoke them. He seemed to be speaking more to himself than his companions, as if repeating a vow. Of course, we know, or think we know, that people who don't have to be president are unlikely to get the chance.\nJoseph Lelyveld is the author most recently of \"Omaha Blues: A Memory Loop\" and a former correspondent and executive editor at The Times.",

(Charles Isherwood)\n'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)\n* 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make \"Grey Gardens\" an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n* 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of \"Hairspray\" fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)\n'LES MIS\u00c9RABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n* 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)\n'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)\n'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance. With his irresistibly mannered performance as a laconic doctor, Mr. Nighy mops the floor with Ms. Moore. Actually, he mops the floor with Mr. Hare's play (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called \"That 80s Show,\" this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\nOff Broadway\n'THE AMERICAN PILOT' The fate of an injured American soldier hangs in the balance when his plane crashes in territory held by rebels fighting a regime backed by the United States. David Greig's play strives for the topical and the universal, but mostly gets hold of the generic (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club's City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)\n'ANNIE' Daddy Warbucks and some elating musical numbers are the real stars of this holiday-season extravaganza about the beauty, fashion and socioecomic makeover of an eternally optimistic little orphaned redhead (2:30). The Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 307-4100. (Anita Gates)\n'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore)\n'CARRIE' This deliberately cheesy comedy version of Stephen King's prom-night horror story has an absurdist attitude, on-target performances and puppets that bleed (1:40). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Gates)\n*'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)\n'ESOTERICA' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)\n'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next \"Rocky Horror Show.\" To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)\n'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)\n* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, \"everything old is old again\" (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)\n'HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD AND FIND TRUE LOVE IN 90 MINUTES' This refreshing musical, born of the Fringe Festival, about a bookstore clerk, a slacker, a diplomat and a terrorist, has witty songs, wacky performances and an untethered sense of fun (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)\n'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)\n'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates)\n* 'KAOS' Martha Clarke's clever compaction of a lengthy 1984 film of the same title, by the Taviani brothers, is based on short stories by Luigi Pirandello, set at the turn of the last century in his native Sicily. A beguiling if deadly serious blend of text, dance and music, adeptly performed and made more flavorful, if more exotic, by Ms. Clarke's decision to have the entire text spoken in Italian (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (John Rockwell)\n'MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS' This musical is too big for its stage, but the young turn-of-the-last-century sweethearts have great chemistry, and there are four terrific songs (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Gates)\n'MURDER MYSTERY BLUES' This musical adaptation of classic Woody Allen short stories comes off like a collection of loose parts (2:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman)\n'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)\n'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)\n'AN OAK TREE' Tim Crouch plays a hypnotist in this elusive puzzle of a play about grief and the power of suggestion (1:05). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)\n'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quipmeisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)\n'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Neil Genzlinger)\n* 'STRIKING 12' A minimalist musical about an odd but rewarding New Year's Eve in the life of a guy who hates New Year's Eve. Performed by the indie pop band Groovelily, it's fresh and funny, and features a standout pop score (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)\n'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER' As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)\n'25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)\n'TWO TRAINS RUNNING' Directed by Lou Bellamy, a rough-edged revival of August Wilson's 1992 play about the stark economics of life and death for African-Americans, set in a dying diner in Pittsburgh in the late 1960s. The pace drags in this production, but it remains a bracing reminder of Mr. Wilson's singular talent for making cold, hard numbers sing hot, molten blues (3:40). Signature Theater at Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)\n* 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)\nOff Off Broadway\n'STRINGS' Keir Dullea stars in Carole Bugg\u00e9's intelligent but ultimately unsuccessful \"Copenhagen\"-inspired drama about three scientists on a train (1:45). 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, Manhattan, (212) 362-0329. (Gates)\n'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny. (1:00) Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)\n'TRUE WEST' This perfectly pleasant new version of Sam Shepard's sibling rivalry drama tries something new: understatement (1:35). Big Little Theater, 141 Ridge Street, Lower East Side, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)\nSpectacles\n'BIG APPLE CIRCUS' One terrific show (2:15).

(Brantley)\nLast Chance\n'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing, offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)\n'THE ATHEIST' Chris Pine stars in Ronan Noone's generally compelling if not always credible one-man drama about a reporter who casually ruins lives trying to make his reputation with a big story (1:30). Center Stage, 48 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Gates)\n'DARK MATTERS' Elizabeth Marvel plays a rural housewife who may be consorting with extraterrestrials in Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa's risible new drama about space critters bent on beginning a new race. Pure hokum (2:00). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444); closing tonight. (Isherwood)\n'THE FORTUNE TELLER' This morality tale for grown-ups is told through marvelously grotesque puppets and a cast, evoking Edward Gorey and Tim Burton. Written by Erik Sanko, it is an allegory of the Seven Deadly Sins, a lovely thing to look upon and listen to (the dark, brooding music is by Mr. Sanko and Danny Elfman), but for all its macabre grisliness, it needs more drama. The detailed puppets are hard to read even in this small theater, and not all of the vignettes live up to the show's initial promise. Still, there's a lot to like, starting with the narrator: an alligator named Silas Leech, voiced in the plummy tones of the musician and actor Gavin Friday (1:00). Here Arts Center, 145 Sixth Avenue, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Anne Midgette)\n* 'HOME' Almost nothing happens in David Storey's \"Home\" -- except to those lucky enough to be in the audience, who are likely to find themselves profoundly touched by this portrait of four lost souls in a home for the mentally challenged or disturbed. The play hasn't been seen much since it was on Broadway in 1970, but the Actors Company Theater's production makes you wonder why. The performances by the four leads, Simon Jones, Larry Keith, Cynthia Harris and Cynthia Darlow, are simply exquisite. Samuel Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)\n'SCHOOL FOR WIVES' The Pearl Theater Company's production of Moli\u00e8re's satire about one misguided man's expectations of women is pleasant, occasionally quite funny and definitely on the side of common sense (1:55). Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802; closing on Sunday. (Gates)\n'THE TAKING OF MISS JANIE' This revival of Ed Bullins's 1974 allegory about race relations and lament for the lost ideals of the '60s is well acted and politically elegant (1:25). The Henry Street Settlement's Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Gates)\n'THAT TIME OF YEAR' Who would have thought that fruitcake jokes could still be funny? But three singing fruitcakes are among the daffy high points of this original musical revue, which surprises repeatedly by getting laughs from standard-issue seasonal themes both Jewish and Christian. There are clunkers, but you leave feeling that the season's a bit brighter (2:00). Theater at St. Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 935-5820; closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger)\nMovies\nRatings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.\n'APOCALYPTO' (R, 138 minutes, in Maya) More blood from Mel Gibson, but more \"Braveheart\" than \"Passion of the Christ.\" Ultraviolent entertainment, well executed (so to speak) but not very surprising in the end. (A. O. Scott)\n'AUTOMATONS' (No rating, 83 minutes) Shot in silvery black and white with old eight-millimeter cameras, this shameless ode to '60s sci-fi depicts a blasted future where the few remaining humans wage a remorseless war of competing beliefs. With its retro look, cautionary theme and endearingly unsophisticated effects, \"Automatons\" leaves us with the comforting notion that the end of the world will look a lot like the beginning of television. (Jeannette Catsoulis)\n'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (Scott)\n'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn human misery into entertainment. (Manohla Dargis)\n'BOBBY' (R, 111 minutes) Emilio Estevez's picture, which follows a score of characters through the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, is full of noble ambition. The day in question ended with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, an event that hovers over the movie, even though Kennedy himself is visible only in archival clips. A huge cast (including Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Lindsay Lohan and Mr. Estevez) labors to inject a collection of melodramatic anecdotes with portent and significance, but the individual parts of the film tend to be either overdone or vague and slight. (Scott)\n* 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Dargis)\n'CASINO ROYALE' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The latest James Bond vehicle finds the British spy leaner, meaner and now played by an attractive piece of blond rough named Daniel Craig. Zap, pow, ka-ching! (Dargis)\n'CHARLOTTE'S WEB' (G, 113 minutes) Gary Winick's adaptation of E. B. White's great children's novel is faithful to the wit and feeling of the source. The celebrity-voiced animals are charming, and Julia Roberts is in fine form as the heroic spider, whose writing ability saves the life of a pig. (Scott)\n'CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER' (R, 114 minutes, in Mandarin) The Chinese director Zhang Yimou aims for Shakespeare and winds up with Jacqueline Susann in this Tang dynasty melodrama roiling with incest, fraternal rivalry and madness-inducing fungus. As an emperor and empress fighting for control of their three sons, Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li lend the film a core of marital toxicity that's deliciously unstable. Directing with operatic delirium, Mr. Zhang has created a movie in which the line between tragedy and black comedy has been all but erased. (Catsoulis)\n'DECK THE HALLS' (PG, 95 minutes) In the holiday tradition of stale fruitcake, ugly snowflake sweaters and food poisoning comes this piece of junk, in which Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito compete to see who can annoy the audience more. (Scott)\n'D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU' (PG-13, 125 minutes) In Tony Scott's preposterous action flick, with Denzel Washington, the gaudy pyrotechnics are nowhere near as jaw-dropping as the screenplay that name-checks not one, not two, but three national tragedies. (Dargis)\n* 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller \"Infernal Affairs,\" it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis)\n'ERAGON' (PG, 99 minutes) This lad-and-his-dragon fantasy set in a land bristling with Tolkienesque nomenclature and earnest British actors is as lacking in fresh ideas as Tim Allen's manager. Directed by the wonderfully named Stefen Fangmeier, it boasts the usual genre lineup: an evil king (John Malkovich), a whey-faced hero (Edward Speleers) and a serene warrior-maiden (Sienna Guillory), as well as the required rebel hordes and bucolic landscapes. Some of the characters won't be returning for the sequel, but no matter. In all likelihood, neither will the audience. (Catsoulis)\n'FAMILY LAW' (No rating, 102 minutes, in Spanish) Exploratory variations on that old saw \"Like father, like son\" are the thematic heart of this third installment in the Argentine filmmaker Daniel Burman's semiautobiographical trilogy of films about fatherhood. The delicate, bittersweet comedy about the relationship of father-and-son lawyers prepares you for an eruption of high drama that never arrives. (Stephen Holden)\n* 'FAST FOOD NATION' (R, 106 minutes) Richard Linklater has turned Eric Schlosser's journalistic expos\u00e9 of the American industrial food system into a thoughtful, occasionally rambling inquiry into the contradictions of contemporary American life. Three stories examine different parts of the capitalist food chain: illegal immigrants from Mexico work in terrible conditions in a meat-processing plant; a restaurant chain executive undergoes a crisis of conscience; and a teenage burger-slinger is drawn into political activism. Mr. Linklater covers a lot of ground, and the result is an unusually funny, moving and intellectually demanding movie. (Scott)\n* '51 BIRCH STREET' (No rating, 88 minutes) The mysteries of ordinary life drive this moving, engrossing documentary, in which the director, Doug Block, tries to figure out his parents' 54-year marriage. (Scott)\n'FLANNEL PAJAMAS' (No rating, 124 minutes) The twin specters of Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen hover over this film, which might have been more accurately titled \"Scenes From a Mixed Marriage\" or \"Annie Hall Without Laughs.\" This smart, talky history of a relationship between two New Yorkers follows a Jewish theatrical promoter and an aspiring caterer with a Roman Catholic background from courtship to marriage to separation. (Holden)\n* 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (\"Wallace and Gromit,\" \"Chicken Run\") is completely delightful. (Scott)\n'FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION' (PG-13, 86 minutes) This satire of pre-Oscar-nomination buzz in Hollywood is far and away the broadest comedy Christopher Guest and his improvisatory company have made. It is also the flimsiest, and unlike Mr. Guest's earlier films, it has no airs of being a fake documentary. As farce trumps satire, the humor's subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, with the brilliant exception of Catherine O'Hara. (Holden)\n'THE FOUNTAIN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Darren Aronovsky's new film spans a thousand years, as Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman pursue undying love and eternal life in the 16th, 21st and 26th centuries. There is some lovely visual poetry, but the ideas are pure doggerel, an ungainly mixture of sci-fi overreach and earnest sentimentality. (Scott)\n'THE GOOD GERMAN' (R, 102 minutes) In his adaptation of the Joseph Kanon novel, Steven Soderbergh attempts to resurrect the magic of classical Hollywood, principally by sucking out all the air, energy and pleasure from his own filmmaking. It's no wonder George Clooney, who stars alongside a vamping Cate Blanchett, looks confused. (Dargis)\n'HAPPY FEET' (PG, 100 minutes) The director George Miller gets happy and snappy, then goes dark and deep, in a musical about an animated penguin who was born to dance. Take hankies. (Dargis)\n* 'INLAND EMPIRE' (No rating, 179 minutes) David Lynch's extraordinary, savagely uncompromised new film stars a dazzling Laura Dern as an actress who tumbles down rabbit holes inside rabbit holes inside rabbit holes. As cracked as Mad magazine, though generally more difficult to parse, the film has the power of nightmares and is one of the few this year that deserve to be called art. (Dargis)\n'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis)\n* 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott)\n* 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on \"Madame Bovary\" against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)\n* 'MARIE ANTOINETTE' (PG-13, 123 minutes) In this elaborate, bittersweet confection, Sofia Coppola imagines the last pre-revolutionary queen of France (played with wit and charm by Kirsten Dunst) as a bored, pleasure-seeking teenager trapped in a world of artifice and rigid protocol. Dreamy and decadent, the film is also touching, funny and bracingly modern. (Scott)\n'MATTHEW BARNEY: NO RESTRAINT' (No rating, 72 minutes) Alison Chernick's aptly-named documentary takes us aboard a Japanese whaling vessel to witness the filming of the artist Matthew Barney's \"Drawing Restraint 9,\" a love story in which he and his partner Bj\u00f6rk dress up, drink tea and transform into whales. But after a meager 72 minutes, the man who stretched an obsession with testicles into a five-film cycle remains as much of an enigma as ever. (Catsoulis)\n'THE NATIVITY STORY' (PG, 100 minutes) Nothing earthshaking, but a fine performance by Keisha Castle-Hughes as Mary offers a glimpse of an interesting movie tucked inside what is otherwise an unsurprising and tasteful Christmas pageant. (Scott)\n'THE PAINTED VEIL' (PG-13, 125 minutes) Nicely directed by John Curran, this version of the W. Somerset Maugham's novel lulls you in by turning a distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance with Naomi Watts and Edward Norton. (Dargis)\n'THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) How you respond to this fairy tale in realist drag may depend on whether you find Will Smith's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. (Dargis)\n'ROCKY BALBOA' (PG, 102 minutes) Surprisingly, the sixth installment of this franchise is no embarrassment. Like its forerunners, it goes the distance almost in spite of itself. It's all heart and no credibility, except as a raw-boned fable. From the very beginning Rocky Balboa was about as lifelike a character as Popeye pumped up with spinach. But that may be the point of a series that peddles the notion that if you dream it hard enough, you can live it. (Holden)\n'THE SECRET LIFE OF WORDS' (No rating, 87 minutes) The heart and soul of this movie is the shattering 10-minute confession of a mysteriously glum, hearing-impaired young woman (Sarah Polley) to a burn victim (Tim Robbins) she is nursing on an oil rig in the Irish Sea. The strongest moments in the film, are those that focus on the central couple. (Holden)\n* 'SHUT UP & SING' (R, 93 minutes) Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck's revealing documentary follows the Dixie Chicks around for three years as the group deals with the consequences of a remark by its lead singer, Natalie Maines, who said from a London stage that they were ashamed the president of the United States was from Texas. The movie is a fascinating study of the relationship between the media, politics and the music industry in an era in which pop musicians are marketed like politicians. (Holden)\n'TURISTAS' (R, 89 minutes) If stupidity were a crime, the nitwits in this cheap horror flick would be doing time in Attica. (Dargis)\n'UNACCOMPANIED MINORS' (PG, 89 minutes) The title doubles as an advisory. Your kids may like it; pick them up when it's over. (Scott)\n'VENUS' (R, 91 minutes) A modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest -- avuncular and also erotic -- of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great Peter O'Toole. (Scott)\n* 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almod\u00f3var, with Pen\u00e9lope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott)\nFilm Series\nTHE COMPLETE JACQUES RIVETTE (Tonight through Sunday) The Museum of the Moving Image's 22-film retrospective of the innovative French New Wave director continues this weekend with four features. \"Divertimento,\" Mr. Rivette's shortened version of \"La Belle Noiseuse,\" is his own four-hour study of the artistic process. \"The Story of Marie and Julien\" (2003), a romantic mystery starring Emmanuelle B\u00e9art, is his most recent film. \"Secret Defense\" (1998), said to have been inspired by Hitchcock's \"Vertigo,\" stars Sandrine Bonnaire as a scientist whose father died mysteriously. \"The Gang of Four\" (1989) is an adventure about acting students and terrorism.

(Gates)\nPop\nFull reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.\nJAI AGNISH, BEN AND VESPER, LENNY SMITH (Thursday) A night in Brooklyn with three underground songwriters from New Jersey. Mr. Agnish, an accomplice of Sufjan Stevens and a sincere indie-rock Christian, sings guilelessly about his faith (he gives a \"thumbs-up to Jesus\") in songs that join acoustic folk with jerky, silly electronics. The male-female duo Ben and Vesper play droopy, forlorn acoustic ballads, and the gospel-folk singer Lenny Smith might be called the father of the scene: his son is Daniel Smith, leader of the perhaps-sincere, perhaps-mocking Christian band Danielson Famile. At 9 p.m., Pete's Candy Store, 709 Lorimer Street, between Frost and Richardson Streets, Williamsburg, (718) 302-3770, petescandystore.com; free. (Ben Sisario)\nBENEVENTO-RUSSO DUO (Wednesday) The keyboardist Marco Benevento and the drummer Joe Russo have had a gradual rise on the jam-band circuit with kinetic meanderings that usually begin in peaceful soul-funk and end up in poundingly insistent climaxes that might as well be punk rock. They play a fifth-anniversary show at the Knitting Factory's tiny downstairs Old Office. At 8 p.m., 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $25. (Sisario)\nBOGMEN (Tonight and tomorrow night) The fence-mending reunion thing worked well for '90s alternative giants like the Pixies and Dinosaur Jr., so what about the littler guys? A decade ago, the Bogmen were one of the biggest local draws in New York, mingling cynical lyrics with propulsive guitar riffs and funk rhythms. It was textbook alt-rock, but the Bogmen struggled to find a national audience and disbanded in 1999. The band's three-night return concludes this weekend. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out.

Their latest album, \"The Gold Record\" (Epitaph), is, like each one before it, chock-full of adrenalized \"Hey! Hey! Hey!\" shout-alongs. The World/Inferno Friendship Society's \"red-eyed soul\" is a snarky mix of ska, punk and horn-driven retro R&B. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $16.

(Stephen Holden)\nFISHBONE (Thursday) Starting in the mid-'80s, this willfully manic Los Angeles group took up George Clinton's challenge that funk bands can play rock as well as anybody, and threw in ska, punk and metal, too, becoming a primary influence on generations of genre-jumbling bands. The current version of Fishbone includes only two original members, the bassist John Norwood Fisher and the top-hatted wild-man singer Angelo Moore, who could not possibly be replaced.

LONNIE SMITH (Tonight through Sunday) David Newman, the soulful tenor saxophonist long associated with Ray Charles, joins Dr. Lonnie Smith, whose unaccredited honorific has always been justified by his authority on the Hammond organ.

But he certainly brings the vocal goods to the title role of Verdi's noble masterpiece \"Don Carlo,\" in John Dexter's production at the Metropolitan Opera. The winning cast includes Patricia Racette as Elisabeth, Dmitri Hvorostovsky as Rodrigo, Olga Borodina as Eboli and the astounding German bass Ren\u00e9 Pape as Philip II. James Levine conducts the score magnificently. The final performance of the season is tomorrow afternoon. At 1 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out.

(Bernard Holland)\n'DIE FLEDERMAUS' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Now in its 59th season, the Amato Opera continues to stage productions in its tiny quarters on the Bowery.

(Vivien Schweitzer)\n* 'I PURITANI' (Wednesday) It's been a while since an opera singer reached such heights that she entered the popular consciousness, but the soprano Anna Netrebko is embarked on a dizzying, meteoric rise. It's a worthy package: she's got the looks, she's got the voice, and when she's onstage, the emotional aloofness that marked her earlier aria albums is replaced with dramatic involvement. This season she is taking on, for the first time onstage, two of the bel canto roles featured on her 2004 album \"Sempre Libera\": Anina in Bellini's \"Sonnambula\" in Vienna and Elvira in the same composer's \"Puritani\" at the Met now. Eric Cutler is her Arturo, John Relyea is Giorgio and Patrick Summers conducts. But Anna is the main attraction: for bel canto fans, long accustomed to a starvation diet from the Met, it should be a wonderful holiday present. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anne Midgette)\n'RIGOLETTO' (Tonight) The strong Spanish baritone Carlos Alvarez has taken over the title role in this Metropolitan Opera revival of Otto Schenk's grimly realistic 1989 production, which has its final performance of the season tonight. In his debut appearances at the Met, the young Polish tenor Piotr Beczala sings the rakish Duke of Mantua. The technically exquisite, if expressively timid, soprano Ekaterina Siurina sings Gilda. Friedrich Haider conducts. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $110 to $205 tickets remaining. (Tommasini)\n'DIE ZAUBERFL\u00d6TE' (Tomorrow and Thursday) This revival of Julie Taymor's production continues tomorrow at the Met, complete with the magical puppets and stage effects that made it an audience hit when it opened in 2004. Isabel Bayrakdarian, who sings with a clear, bright, expressive soprano, is a radiant and convincing Pamina. Scott Bergeson conducts a cast that also includes Christoph Strehl as Tamino, Rodion Pogossov as Papageno, Cornelia G\u00f6tz as Queen of the Night, Stephen Milling as Sarastro and Robert Lloyd as the speaker. On Thursday, James Levine conducts and the mesmerizing German bass Ren\u00e9 Pape sings Sarastro.

At 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $60. (Allan Kozinn)\nEARLY MUSIC NEW YORK (Today, tomorrow and Monday) The \"Medieval Christmas\" program by Frederick Renz and his supremely polished vocal and instrumental ensemble has been a seasonal favorite for years and is available on recordings from the group's Ex Cathedra label. But as new performers join the group, Mr. Renz has continued to refine its sound. The works at hand, drawn from all over medieval Europe, include Latin hymns, Spanish cantigas and pieces by Perotin and Hildegard von Bingen. Tonight at 8, and tomorrow and Monday at 3 and 8, St. James Chapel, Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, Amsterdam Avenue at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 280-0330, earlymusicny.org; $40; $20 for students. (Kozinn)\n'MESSIAH' (Tomorrow) Handel's oratorio is so ubiquitous in these parts at this time of year that it should be no surprise it's made the Guinness World Records book: the Masterwork Chorus, founded in 1955, has given the most complete performances of the work. Quality, not quantity, of course, should be the benchmark, but the experience means that the group, based in New Jersey and conducted by Andrew Megill, can be relied on to turn out a pretty good show. Kiera Duffy, Leah Wool, Tony Boutt\u00e9 and Steven Condy are the vocal soloists. At 3 and 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $20 to $100.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.\nMuseums\n* American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Roberta Smith)\nBROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'Watercolors by Walton Ford,' through Jan. 28. This show assembles more than 50 of Mr. Ford's large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora. They frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images the sense is that some horrible violence has occurred or is about to happen. This artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.(Benjamin Genocchio)\nCooper-Hewitt National Design Museum : 'DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,' through July 29. This ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design as a whole, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas, sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith)\n* GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso,' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Vel\u00e1zquezes and Zurbar\u00e1ns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dal\u00eds and Picassos, many famous, many not. The big point is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Vel\u00e1zquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman)\n* THE METropolitan museum of art: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s,' through Feb. 19. This show's 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)\n* THE MET: 'LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL -- AN ARTIST'S COUNTRY ESTATE,' through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound -- and of the Tiffany residences preceding it -- is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (See above.) (Smith)\n* MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,' through March 4. Saul Steinberg's famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything -- Floridians, linguistic concepts, erotica, cowboys, Cubism, nature, architecture and women -- with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 drawings, collages and constructions goes on, Steinberg's progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like \"Feet on Chair\" (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like \"Street War (Cadavre Exquisis)\" (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Grace Glueck)\n* MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG'S NEW YORK,' through March 25. A very lively adjunct to the Morgan show, this smaller display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here looming majestically over brownstones and in another incarnation, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg's eyes, could be monuments, too. And no one ever fully appreciated the impact of upscale New York women until Steinberg the misogynist came along. \"Fur Coats\" (1951) portrays four expensive baroque pelts wearing four women, and it's dead on. You may think you know Steinberg's work, but these shows make it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Glueck)\n* NEUE GALLERY: 'JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,' through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Mr. Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or \"total work of art,\" orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Glueck)\nQueens Museum of Art: 'Queens International 2006: Everything All at Once,' through Jan. 14. The 52 artists and two collaboratives in this exhibition are natives of various regions of North America, as well as Bosnia, China, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Peru and Venezuela. The only common ground, perhaps, is that they all live in Queens. Instead of arranging the work according to medium, ethnicity or generalized themes, the curators follow the edict of the exhibition's subtitle. The exhibition tries to balance the interests of the art crowd and local residents. Sometimes these concerns dovetail nicely, as in Sophia Peer's quick-cut video \"Everyday,\" which shows her aging parents moving around their cramped home in Queens like latter-day, empty-nest Bunkers. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, www.queensmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)\nStudio Museum in Harlem: 'Africa Comics,' through March 18. Intense is the word for this modest-size first-time United States survey of designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense, the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. The entertainment value is high. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids, and the schlumpy but wily character named Goorgoolou from Senegal. But more often than not, humor is sugarcoating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)\nWhitney Museum of American Art: 'Kiki Smith: A Gathering, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float here: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter)\nGalleries: Uptown\n* 'AMERICAN MASTERWORKS FROM THE MUNSON-WILLIAMS-PROCTOR ARTS INSTITUTE' This Utica, N.Y., institution, celebrating its educational alliance with New York City's Pratt Institute, is showing more than 75 paintings, drawings, sculptures and furniture pieces, from the 18th to the 20th centuries. A highlight is the original version of Thomas Cole's moving allegory \"The Voyage of Life\" (1839-40), which in four monumental canvases compares the journey from childhood to old age with the winding course of a river. A smashing portrait of the Revolutionary War general Peter Gansevoort (about 1794) by Gilbert Stuart is a distinguished entry from the earlier part of the show. Post-WorldWar II paintings by Pollock and Rothko add to the buzz. Hirschl & Adler, 21 East 70th Street, (212) 535-8810, hirschlandadler.com, through Dec. 29. (Glueck)\n* 'THE ODYSSEY CONTINUES: MASTERWORKS FROM THE NEW ORLEANS MUSEUM OF ART AND FROM PRIVATE NEW ORLEANS COLLECTIONS' Nearly 100 European and American objects covering six centuries, from the New Orleans Museum of Art but also from private lenders, are displayed. They range from the Venetian-born Lorenzo Lotto, whose forceful study of an authoritative figure, \"Portrait of a Bearded Man\" (1530-35), is a highlight, to works by contemporary Americans. A showstopper is a full-length portrait of Marie Antoinette (about 1788) by Elizabeth Vigee-Lebrun, in which the doomed French queen wears an enormous feathered concoction on the head she was eventually to lose. Sculptures by Rodin, Brancusi, Louise Bourgeois and Louise Nevelson are also part of the treasures on view. The show is a benefit for the New Orleans Museum, whose building -- though not its art -- was battered by Hurricane Katrina.

Cy Twombly in Cyberspace. Existential physics. The trajectories of car bombs. These phrases came to mind in front of Dennis Balk's garbled computer-generated drawings on canvas and digitally mixed color photographs. Randomness, violence and information overload are intimated with a handful of portrait-snapshots of Arab men, taken at a Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan, functioning as still points.

The residents bring into the open the smoldering aggression that always keeps Mr. Bates's canvases from sitting quietly on the wall and give it the force of immediate human emotions and events. D. C.

In \"Dark Night of the Soul\" (2005-6), which invokes Stanley Kubrick's \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" a figure in a space suit is shown wandering through the exotic scenery of the American Museum of Natural History after hours, to the poetic sound of a flute.

Big, sprawling sculptures and rough collages recreate the hectic spaghetti of subway lines and the intricate wiring of radio circuitry. The work itself cultivates the look of the amateur, the hobbyist with a ham radio or a backyard workshop and a jigsaw churning out crudely built constructions that look as if they might topple over at any second. At the same time, there's an offhanded vapidity to these references that suggests they are little more than visual candy for the graphically attuned eye.

    "text": "What Should a Billionaire Give - and What Should You?\n2006-12-17T05:00:00.000Z\nWhat is a human life worth? You may not want to put a price tag on a it. But if we really had to, most of us would agree that the value of a human life would be in the millions. Consistent with the foundations of our democracy and our frequently professed belief in the inherent dignity of human beings, we would also agree that all humans are created equal, at least to the extent of denying that differences of sex, ethnicity, nationality and place of residence change the value of a human life.\nWith Christmas approaching, and Americans writing checks to their favorite charities, it's a good time to ask how these two beliefs -- that a human life, if it can be priced at all, is worth millions, and that the factors I have mentioned do not alter the value of a human life -- square with our actions. Perhaps this year such questions lurk beneath the surface of more family discussions than usual, for it has been an extraordinary year for philanthropy, especially philanthropy to fight global poverty.\nFor Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, the ideal of valuing all human life equally began to jar against reality some years ago, when he read an article about diseases in the developing world and came across the statistic that half a million children die every year from rotavirus, the most common cause of severe diarrhea in children. He had never heard of rotavirus. \"How could I never have heard of something that kills half a million children every year?\" he asked himself. He then learned that in developing countries, millions of children die from diseases that have been eliminated, or virtually eliminated, in the United States. That shocked him because he assumed that, if there are vaccines and treatments that could save lives, governments would be doing everything possible to get them to the people who need them. As Gates told a meeting of the World Health Assembly in Geneva last year, he and his wife, Melinda, \"couldn't escape the brutal conclusion that -- in our world today -- some lives are seen as worth saving and others are not.\" They said to themselves, \"This can't be true.\" But they knew it was.\nGates's speech to the World Health Assembly concluded on an optimistic note, looking forward to the next decade when \"people will finally accept that the death of a child in the developing world is just as tragic as the death of a child in the developed world.\" That belief in the equal value of all human life is also prominent on the Web site of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, where under Our Values we read: \"All lives -- no matter where they are being led -- have equal value.\"\nWe are very far from acting in accordance with that belief. In the same world in which more than a billion people live at a level of affluence never previously known, roughly a billion other people struggle to survive on the purchasing power equivalent of less than one U.S. dollar per day. Most of the world's poorest people are undernourished, lack access to safe drinking water or even the most basic health services and cannot send their children to school. According to Unicef, more than 10 million children die every year -- about 30,000 per day -- from avoidable, poverty-related causes.\nLast June the investor Warren Buffett took a significant step toward reducing those deaths when he pledged $31 billion to the Gates Foundation, and another $6 billion to other charitable foundations. Buffett's pledge, set alongside the nearly $30 billion given by Bill and Melinda Gates to their foundation, has made it clear that the first decade of the 21st century is a new \"golden age of philanthropy.\" On an inflation-adjusted basis, Buffett has pledged to give more than double the lifetime total given away by two of the philanthropic giants of the past, Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, put together. Bill and Melinda Gates's gifts are not far behind.\nGates's and Buffett's donations will now be put to work primarily to reduce poverty, disease and premature death in the developing world. According to the Global Forum for Health Research, less than 10 percent of the world's health research budget is spent on combating conditions that account for 90 percent of the global burden of disease. In the past, diseases that affect only the poor have been of no commercial interest to pharmaceutical manufacturers, because the poor cannot afford to buy their products. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), heavily supported by the Gates Foundation, seeks to change this by guaranteeing to purchase millions of doses of vaccines, when they are developed, that can prevent diseases like malaria. GAVI has also assisted developing countries to immunize more people with existing vaccines: 99 million additional children have been reached to date. By doing this, GAVI claims to have already averted nearly 1.7 million future deaths.\nPhilanthropy on this scale raises many ethical questions: Why are the people who are giving doing so? Does it do any good? Should we praise them for giving so much or criticize them for not giving still more? Is it troubling that such momentous decisions are made by a few extremely wealthy individuals? And how do our judgments about them reflect on our own way of living?\nLet's start with the question of motives. The rich must -- or so some of us with less money like to assume -- suffer sleepless nights because of their ruthlessness in squeezing out competitors, firing workers, shutting down plants or whatever else they have to do to acquire their wealth. When wealthy people give away money, we can always say that they are doing it to ease their consciences or generate favorable publicity. It has been suggested -- by, for example, David Kirkpatrick, a senior editor at Fortune magazine -- that Bill Gates's turn to philanthropy was linked to the antitrust problems Microsoft had in the U.S. and the European Union. Was Gates, consciously or subconsciously, trying to improve his own image and that of his company?\nThis kind of sniping tells us more about the attackers than the attacked. Giving away large sums, rather than spending the money on corporate advertising or developing new products, is not a sensible strategy for increasing personal wealth. When we read that someone has given away a lot of their money, or time, to help others, it challenges us to think about our own behavior. Should we be following their example, in our own modest way? But if the rich just give their money away to improve their image, or to make up for past misdeeds -- misdeeds quite unlike any we have committed, of course -- then, conveniently, what they are doing has no relevance to what we ought to do.\nA famous story is told about Thomas Hobbes, the 17th-century English philosopher, who argued that we all act in our own interests. On seeing him give alms to a beggar, a cleric asked Hobbes if he would have done this if Christ had not commanded us to do so. Yes, Hobbes replied, he was in pain to see the miserable condition of the old man, and his gift, by providing the man with some relief from that misery, also eased Hobbes's pain. That reply reconciles Hobbes's charity with his egoistic theory of human motivation, but at the cost of emptying egoism of much of its bite. If egoists suffer when they see a stranger in distress, they are capable of being as charitable as any altruist.\nFollowers of the 18th-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant would disagree. They think an act has moral worth only if it is done out of a sense of duty. Doing something merely because you enjoy doing it, or enjoy seeing its consequences, they say, has no moral worth, because if you happened not to enjoy doing it, then you wouldn't do it, and you are not responsible for your likes and dislikes, whereas you are responsible for your obedience to the demands of duty.\nPerhaps some philanthropists are motivated by their sense of duty. Apart from the equal value of all human life, the other \"simple value\" that lies at the core of the work of the Gates Foundation, according to its Web site, is \"To whom much has been given, much is expected.\" That suggests the view that those who have great wealth have a duty to use it for a larger purpose than their own interests. But while such questions of motive may be relevant to our assessment of Gates's or Buffett's character, they pale into insignificance when we consider the effect of what Gates and Buffett are doing. The parents whose children could die from rotavirus care more about getting the help that will save their children's lives than about the motivations of those who make that possible.\nInterestingly, neither Gates nor Buffett seems motivated by the possibility of being rewarded in heaven for his good deeds on earth. Gates told a Time interviewer, \"There's a lot more I could be doing on a Sunday morning\" than going to church. Put them together with Andrew Carnegie, famous for his freethinking, and three of the four greatest American philanthropists have been atheists or agnostics. (The exception is John D. Rockefeller.) In a country in which 96 percent of the population say they believe in a supreme being, that's a striking fact. It means that in one sense, Gates and Buffett are probably less self-interested in their charity than someone like Mother Teresa, who as a pious Roman Catholic believed in reward and punishment in the afterlife.\nMore important than questions about motives are questions about whether there is an obligation for the rich to give, and if so, how much they should give. A few years ago, an African-American cabdriver taking me to the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington asked me if I worked at the bank. I told him I did not but was speaking at a conference on development and aid. He then assumed that I was an economist, but when I said no, my training was in philosophy, he asked me if I thought the U.S. should give foreign aid. When I answered affirmatively, he replied that the government shouldn't tax people in order to give their money to others. That, he thought, was robbery. When I asked if he believed that the rich should voluntarily donate some of what they earn to the poor, he said that if someone had worked for his money, he wasn't going to tell him what to do with it.\nAt that point we reached our destination. Had the journey continued, I might have tried to persuade him that people can earn large amounts only when they live under favorable social circumstances, and that they don't create those circumstances by themselves. I could have quoted Warren Buffett's acknowledgment that society is responsible for much of his wealth. \"If you stick me down in the middle of Bangladesh or Peru,\" he said, \"you'll find out how much this talent is going to produce in the wrong kind of soil.\" The Nobel Prize-winning economist and social scientist Herbert Simon estimated that \"social capital\" is responsible for at least 90 percent of what people earn in wealthy societies like those of the United States or northwestern Europe. By social capital Simon meant not only natural resources but, more important, the technology and organizational skills in the community, and the presence of good government. These are the foundation on which the rich can begin their work. \"On moral grounds,\" Simon added, \"we could argue for a flat income tax of 90 percent.\" Simon was not, of course, advocating so steep a rate of tax, for he was well aware of disincentive effects. But his estimate does undermine the argument that the rich are entitled to keep their wealth because it is all a result of their hard work. If Simon is right, that is true of at most 10 percent of it.\nIn any case, even if we were to grant that people deserve every dollar they earn, that doesn't answer the question of what they should do with it. We might say that they have a right to spend it on lavish parties, private jets and luxury yachts, or, for that matter, to flush it down the toilet. But we could still think that for them to do these things while others die from easily preventable diseases is wrong. In an article I wrote more than three decades ago, at the time of a humanitarian emergency in what is now Bangladesh, I used the example of walking by a shallow pond and seeing a small child who has fallen in and appears to be in danger of drowning. Even though we did nothing to cause the child to fall into the pond, almost everyone agrees that if we can save the child at minimal inconvenience or trouble to ourselves, we ought to do so. Anything else would be callous, indecent and, in a word, wrong. The fact that in rescuing the child we may, for example, ruin a new pair of shoes is not a good reason for allowing the child to drown. Similarly if for the cost of a pair of shoes we can contribute to a health program in a developing country that stands a good chance of saving the life of a child, we ought to do so.\nPerhaps, though, our obligation to help the poor is even stronger than this example implies, for we are less innocent than the passer-by who did nothing to cause the child to fall into the pond. Thomas Pogge, a philosopher at Columbia University, has argued that at least some of our affluence comes at the expense of the poor. He bases this claim not simply on the usual critique of the barriers that Europe and the United States maintain against agricultural imports from developing countries but also on less familiar aspects of our trade with developing countries. For example, he points out that international corporations are willing to make deals to buy natural resources from any government, no matter how it has come to power. This provides a huge financial incentive for groups to try to overthrow the existing government. Successful rebels are rewarded by being able to sell off the nation's oil, minerals or timber.\nIn their dealings with corrupt dictators in developing countries, Pogge asserts, international corporations are morally no better than someone who knowingly buys stolen goods -- with the difference that the international legal and political order recognizes the corporations, not as criminals in possession of stolen goods but as the legal owners of the goods they have bought. This situation is, of course, beneficial for the industrial nations, because it enables us to obtain the raw materials we need to maintain our prosperity, but it is a disaster for resource-rich developing countries, turning the wealth that should benefit them into a curse that leads to a cycle of coups, civil wars and corruption and is of little benefit to the people as a whole.\nIn this light, our obligation to the poor is not just one of providing assistance to strangers but one of compensation for harms that we have caused and are still causing them. It might be argued that we do not owe the poor compensation, because our affluence actually benefits them. Living luxuriously, it is said, provides employment, and so wealth trickles down, helping the poor more effectively than aid does. But the rich in industrialized nations buy virtually nothing that is made by the very poor. During the past 20 years of economic globalization, although expanding trade has helped lift many of the world's poor out of poverty, it has failed to benefit the poorest 10 percent of the world's population. Some of the extremely poor, most of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa, have nothing to sell that rich people want, while others lack the infrastructure to get their goods to market. If they can get their crops to a port, European and U.S. subsidies often mean that they cannot sell them, despite -- as for example in the case of West African cotton growers who compete with vastly larger and richer U.S. cotton producers -- having a lower production cost than the subsidized producers in the rich nations.\nThe remedy to these problems, it might reasonably be suggested, should come from the state, not from private philanthropy. When aid comes through the government, everyone who earns above the tax-free threshold contributes something, with more collected from those with greater ability to pay. Much as we may applaud what Gates and Buffett are doing, we can also be troubled by a system that leaves the fate of hundreds of millions of people hanging on the decisions of two or three private citizens. But the amount of foreign development aid given by the U.S. government is, at 22 cents for every $100 the nation earns, about the same, as a percentage of gross national income, as Portugal gives and about half that of the U.K. Worse still, much of it is directed where it best suits U.S. strategic interests -- Iraq is now by far the largest recipient of U.S. development aid, and Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan and Afghanistan all rank in the Top 10. Less than a quarter of official U.S. development aid -- barely a nickel in every $100 of our G.N.I. -- goes to the world's poorest nations.\nAdding private philanthropy to U.S. government aid improves this picture, because Americans privately give more per capita to international philanthropic causes than the citizens of almost any other nation. Even when private donations are included, however, countries like Norway, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands give three or four times as much foreign aid, in proportion to the size of their economies, as the U.S. gives -- with a much larger percentage going to the poorest nations. At least as things now stand, the case for philanthropic efforts to relieve global poverty is not susceptible to the argument that the government has taken care of the problem. And even if official U.S. aid were better-directed and comparable, relative to our gross domestic product, with that of the most generous nations, there would still be a role for private philanthropy. Unconstrained by diplomatic considerations or the desire to swing votes at the United Nations, private donors can more easily avoid dealing with corrupt or wasteful governments. They can go directly into the field, working with local villages and grass-roots organizations.\nNor are philanthropists beholden to lobbyists. As The New York Times reported recently, billions of dollars of U.S. aid is tied to domestic goods. Wheat for Africa must be grown in America, although aid experts say this often depresses local African markets, reducing the incentive for farmers there to produce more. In a decision that surely costs lives, hundreds of millions of condoms intended to stop the spread of AIDS in Africa and around the world must be manufactured in the U.S., although they cost twice as much as similar products made in Asia.\nIn other ways, too, private philanthropists are free to venture where governments fear to tread. Through a foundation named for his wife, Susan Thompson Buffett, Warren Buffett has supported reproductive rights, including family planning and pro-choice organizations. In another unusual initiative, he has pledged $50 million for the International Atomic Energy Agency's plan to establish a \"fuel bank\" to supply nuclear-reactor fuel to countries that meet their nuclear-nonproliferation commitments. The idea, which has been talked about for many years, is widely agreed to be a useful step toward discouraging countries from building their own facilities for producing nuclear fuel, which could then be diverted to weapons production. It is, Buffett said, \"an investment in a safer world.\" Though it is something that governments could and should be doing, no government had taken the first step.\nAid has always had its critics. Carefully planned and intelligently directed private philanthropy may be the best answer to the claim that aid doesn't work. Of course, as in any large-scale human enterprise, some aid can be ineffective. But provided that aid isn't actually counterproductive, even relatively inefficient assistance is likely to do more to advance human wellbeing than luxury spending by the wealthy.\nThe rich, then, should give. But how much should they give? Gates may have given away nearly $30 billion, but that still leaves him sitting at the top of the Forbes list of the richest Americans, with $53 billion. His 66,000-square-foot high-tech lakeside estate near Seattle is reportedly worth more than $100 million. Property taxes are about $1 million. Among his possessions is the Leicester Codex, the only handwritten book by Leonardo da Vinci still in private hands, for which he paid $30.8 million in 1994. Has Bill Gates done enough? More pointedly, you might ask: if he really believes that all lives have equal value, what is he doing living in such an expensive house and owning a Leonardo Codex? Are there no more lives that could be saved by living more modestly and adding the money thus saved to the amount he has already given?\nYet we should recognize that, if judged by the proportion of his wealth that he has given away, Gates compares very well with most of the other people on the Forbes 400 list, including his former colleague and Microsoft co-founder, Paul Allen. Allen, who left the company in 1983, has given, over his lifetime, more than $800 million to philanthropic causes. That is far more than nearly any of us will ever be able to give. But Forbes lists Allen as the fifth-richest American, with a net worth of $16 billion. He owns the Seattle Seahawks, the Portland Trailblazers, a 413-foot oceangoing yacht that carries two helicopters and a 60-foot submarine. He has given only about 5 percent of his total wealth.\nIs there a line of moral adequacy that falls between the 5 percent that Allen has given away and the roughly 35 percent that Gates has donated? Few people have set a personal example that would allow them to tell Gates that he has not given enough, but one who could is Zell Kravinsky. A few years ago, when he was in his mid-40s, Kravinsky gave almost all of his $45 million real estate fortune to health-related charities, retaining only his modest family home in Jenkintown, near Philadelphia, and enough to meet his family's ordinary expenses. After learning that thousands of people with failing kidneys die each year while waiting for a transplant, he contacted a Philadelphia hospital and donated one of his kidneys to a complete stranger.\nAfter reading about Kravinsky in The New Yorker, I invited him to speak to my classes at Princeton. He comes across as anguished by the failure of others to see the simple logic that lies behind his altruism. Kravinsky has a mathematical mind -- a talent that obviously helped him in deciding what investments would prove profitable -- and he says that the chances of dying as a result of donating a kidney are about 1 in 4,000. For him this implies that to withhold a kidney from someone who would otherwise die means valuing one's own life at 4,000 times that of a stranger, a ratio Kravinsky considers \"obscene.\"\nWhat marks Kravinsky from the rest of us is that he takes the equal value of all human life as a guide to life, not just as a nice piece of rhetoric. He acknowledges that some people think he is crazy, and even his wife says she believes that he goes too far. One of her arguments against the kidney donation was that one of their children may one day need a kidney, and Zell could be the only compatible donor. Kravinsky's love for his children is, as far as I can tell, as strong as that of any normal parent. Such attachments are part of our nature, no doubt the product of our evolution as mammals who give birth to children, who for an unusually long time require our assistance in order to survive. But that does not, in Kravinsky's view, justify our placing a value on the lives of our children that is thousands of times greater than the value we place on the lives of the children of strangers. Asked if he would allow his child to die if it would enable a thousand children to live, Kravinsky said yes. Indeed, he has said he would permit his child to die even if this enabled only two other children to live. Nevertheless, to appease his wife, he recently went back into real estate, made some money and bought the family a larger home. But he still remains committed to giving away as much as possible, subject only to keeping his domestic life reasonably tranquil.\nBuffett says he believes in giving his children \"enough so they feel they could do anything, but not so much that they could do nothing.\" That means, in his judgment, \"a few hundred thousand\" each. In absolute terms, that is far more than most Americans are able to leave their children and, by Kravinsky's standard, certainly too much. (Kravinsky says that the hard part is not giving away the first $45 million but the last $10,000, when you have to live so cheaply that you can't function in the business world.) But even if Buffett left each of his three children a million dollars each, he would still have given away more than 99.99 percent of his wealth. When someone does that much -- especially in a society in which the norm is to leave most of your wealth to your children -- it is better to praise them than to cavil about the extra few hundred thousand dollars they might have given.\nPhilosophers like Liam Murphy of New York University and my colleague Kwame Anthony Appiah at Princeton contend that our obligations are limited to carrying our fair share of the burden of relieving global poverty. They would have us calculate how much would be required to ensure that the world's poorest people have a chance at a decent life, and then divide this sum among the affluent. That would give us each an amount to donate, and having given that, we would have fulfilled our obligations to the poor.\nWhat might that fair amount be? One way of calculating it would be to take as our target, at least for the next nine years, the Millennium Development Goals, set by the United Nations Millennium Summit in 2000. On that occasion, the largest gathering of world leaders in history jointly pledged to meet, by 2015, a list of goals that include:\nReducing by half the proportion of the world's people in extreme poverty (defined as living on less than the purchasing-power equivalent of one U.S. dollar per day).\nReducing by half the proportion of people who suffer from hunger.\nEnsuring that children everywhere are able to take a full course of primary schooling.\nEnding sex disparity in education.\nReducing by two-thirds the mortality rate among children under 5.\nReducing by three-quarters the rate of maternal mortality.\nHalting and beginning to reverse the spread of H.I.V./AIDS and halting and beginning to reduce the incidence of malaria and other major diseases.\nReducing by half the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water.\nLast year a United Nations task force, led by the Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs, estimated the annual cost of meeting these goals to be $121 billion in 2006, rising to $189 billion by 2015. When we take account of existing official development aid promises, the additional amount needed each year to meet the goals is only $48 billion for 2006 and $74 billion for 2015.\nNow let's look at the incomes of America's rich and superrich, and ask how much they could reasonably give. The task is made easier by statistics recently provided by Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, economists at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, Paris-Jourdan, and the University of California, Berkeley, respectively, based on U.S. tax data for 2004. Their figures are for pretax income, excluding income from capital gains, which for the very rich are nearly always substantial. For simplicity I have rounded the figures, generally downward. Note too that the numbers refer to \"tax units,\" that is, in many cases, families rather than individuals.\nPiketty and Saez's top bracket comprises 0.01 percent of U.S. taxpayers. There are 14,400 of them, earning an average of $12,775,000, with total earnings of $184 billion. The minimum annual income in this group is more than $5 million, so it seems reasonable to suppose that they could, without much hardship, give away a third of their annual income, an average of $4.3 million each, for a total of around $61 billion. That would still leave each of them with an annual income of at least $3.3 million.\nNext comes the rest of the top 0.1 percent (excluding the category just described, as I shall do henceforth). There are 129,600 in this group, with an average income of just over $2 million and a minimum income of $1.1 million. If they were each to give a quarter of their income, that would yield about $65 billion, and leave each of them with at least $846,000 annually.\nThe top 0.5 percent consists of 575,900 taxpayers, with an average income of $623,000 and a minimum of $407,000. If they were to give one-fifth of their income, they would still have at least $325,000 each, and they would be giving a total of $72 billion.\nComing down to the level of those in the top 1 percent, we find 719,900 taxpayers with an average income of $327,000 and a minimum of $276,000. They could comfortably afford to give 15 percent of their income. That would yield $35 billion and leave them with at least $234,000.\nFinally, the remainder of the nation's top 10 percent earn at least $92,000 annually, with an average of $132,000. There are nearly 13 million in this group. If they gave the traditional tithe -- 10 percent of their income, or an average of $13,200 each -- this would yield about $171 billion and leave them a minimum of $83,000.\nYou could spend a long time debating whether the fractions of income I have suggested for donation constitute the fairest possible scheme. Perhaps the sliding scale should be steeper, so that the superrich give more and the merely comfortable give less. And it could be extended beyond the Top 10 percent of American families, so that everyone able to afford more than the basic necessities of life gives something, even if it is as little as 1 percent. Be that as it may, the remarkable thing about these calculations is that a scale of donations that is unlikely to impose significant hardship on anyone yields a total of $404 billion -- from just 10 percent of American families.\nObviously, the rich in other nations should share the burden of relieving global poverty. The U.S. is responsible for 36 percent of the gross domestic product of all Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations. Arguably, because the U.S. is richer than all other major nations, and its wealth is more unevenly distributed than wealth in almost any other industrialized country, the rich in the U.S. should contribute more than 36 percent of total global donations. So somewhat more than 36 percent of all aid to relieve global poverty should come from the U.S. For simplicity, let's take half as a fair share for the U.S. On that basis, extending the scheme I have suggested worldwide would provide $808 billion annually for development aid. That's more than six times what the task force chaired by Sachs estimated would be required for 2006 in order to be on track to meet the Millennium Development Goals, and more than 16 times the shortfall between that sum and existing official development aid commitments.\nIf we are obliged to do no more than our fair share of eliminating global poverty, the burden will not be great. But is that really all we ought to do? Since we all agree that fairness is a good thing, and none of us like doing more because others don't pull their weight, the fair-share view is attractive. In the end, however, I think we should reject it. Let's return to the drowning child in the shallow pond. Imagine it is not 1 small child who has fallen in, but 50 children. We are among 50 adults, unrelated to the children, picnicking on the lawn around the pond. We can easily wade into the pond and rescue the children, and the fact that we would find it cold and unpleasant sloshing around in the knee-deep muddy water is no justification for failing to do so. The \"fair share\" theorists would say that if we each rescue one child, all the children will be saved, and so none of us have an obligation to save more than one. But what if half the picnickers prefer staying clean and dry to rescuing any children at all? Is it acceptable if the rest of us stop after we have rescued just one child, knowing that we have done our fair share, but that half the children will drown? We might justifiably be furious with those who are not doing their fair share, but our anger with them is not a reason for letting the children die. In terms of praise and blame, we are clearly right to condemn, in the strongest terms, those who do nothing. In contrast, we may withhold such condemnation from those who stop when they have done their fair share. Even so, they have let children drown when they could easily have saved them, and that is wrong.\nSimilarly, in the real world, it should be seen as a serious moral failure when those with ample income do not do their fair share toward relieving global poverty. It isn't so easy, however, to decide on the proper approach to take to those who limit their contribution to their fair share when they could easily do more and when, because others are not playing their part, a further donation would assist many in desperate need. In the privacy of our own judgment, we should believe that it is wrong not to do more. But whether we should actually criticize people who are doing their fair share, but no more than that, depends on the psychological impact that such criticism will have on them, and on others. This in turn may depend on social practices. If the majority are doing little or nothing, setting a standard higher than the fair-share level may seem so demanding that it discourages people who are willing to make an equitable contribution from doing even that. So it may be best to refrain from criticizing those who achieve the fair-share level. In moving our society's standards forward, we may have to progress one step at a time.\nFor more than 30 years, I've been reading, writing and teaching about the ethical issue posed by the juxtaposition, on our planet, of great abundance and life-threatening poverty. Yet it was not until, in preparing this article, I calculated how much America's Top 10 percent of income earners actually make that I fully understood how easy it would be for the world's rich to eliminate, or virtually eliminate, global poverty. (It has actually become much easier over the last 30 years, as the rich have grown significantly richer.) I found the result astonishing. I double-checked the figures and asked a research assistant to check them as well. But they were right. Measured against our capacity, the Millennium Development Goals are indecently, shockingly modest. If we fail to achieve them -- as on present indications we well might -- we have no excuses. The target we should be setting for ourselves is not halving the proportion of people living in extreme poverty, and without enough to eat, but ensuring that no one, or virtually no one, needs to live in such degrading conditions. That is a worthy goal, and it is well within our reach.\nPeter Singer is the Ira W. DeCamp professor of bioethics at the Center for Human Values at Princeton University.

    "text": "What Should a Billionaire Give \u2013 and What Should You?\n2006-12-17T05:00:00.000Z\n What is a human life worth? You may not want to put a price tag on a it. But if we really had to, most of us would agree that the value of a human life would be in the millions. Consistent with the foundations of our democracy and our frequently professed belief in the inherent dignity of human beings, we would also agree that all humans are created equal, at least to the extent of denying that differences of sex, ethnicity, nationality and place of residence change the value of a human life.\nWith Christmas approaching, and Americans writing checks to their favorite charities, it\u2019s a good time to ask how these two beliefs \u2014 that a human life, if it can be priced at all, is worth millions, and that the factors I have mentioned do not alter the value of a human life \u2014 square with our actions. Perhaps this year such questions lurk beneath the surface of more family discussions than usual, for it has been an extraordinary year for philanthropy, especially philanthropy to fight global poverty. \nFor Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, the ideal of valuing all human life equally began to jar against reality some years ago, when he read an article about diseases in the developing world and came across the statistic that half a million children die every year from rotavirus, the most common cause of severe diarrhea in children. He had never heard of rotavirus. \u201cHow could I never have heard of something that kills half a million children every year?\u201d he asked himself. He then learned that in developing countries, millions of children die from diseases that have been eliminated, or virtually eliminated, in the United States. That shocked him because he assumed that, if there are vaccines and treatments that could save lives, governments would be doing everything possible to get them to the people who need them. As Gates told a meeting of the World Health Assembly in Geneva last year, he and his wife, Melinda, \u201ccouldn\u2019t escape the brutal conclusion that \u2014 in our world today \u2014 some lives are seen as worth saving and others are not.\u201d They said to themselves, \u201cThis can\u2019t be true.\u201d But they knew it was.\nGates\u2019s speech to the World Health Assembly concluded on an optimistic note, looking forward to the next decade when \u201cpeople will finally accept that the death of a child in the developing world is just as tragic as the death of a child in the developed world.\u201d That belief in the equal value of all human life is also prominent on the Web site of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, where under Our Values we read: \u201cAll lives \u2014 no matter where they are being led \u2014 have equal value.\u201d\nWe are very far from acting in accordance with that belief. In the same world in which more than a billion people live at a level of affluence never previously known, roughly a billion other people struggle to survive on the purchasing power equivalent of less than one U.S. dollar per day. Most of the world\u2019s poorest people are undernourished, lack access to safe drinking water or even the most basic health services and cannot send their children to school. According to Unicef, more than 10 million children die every year \u2014 about 30,000 per day \u2014 from avoidable, poverty-related causes. \nLast June the investor Warren Buffett took a significant step toward reducing those deaths when he pledged $31 billion to the Gates Foundation, and another $6 billion to other charitable foundations. Buffett\u2019s pledge, set alongside the nearly $30 billion given by Bill and Melinda Gates to their foundation, has made it clear that the first decade of the 21st century is a new \u201cgolden age of philanthropy.\u201d On an inflation-adjusted basis, Buffett has pledged to give more than double the lifetime total given away by two of the philanthropic giants of the past, Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, put together. Bill and Melinda Gates\u2019s gifts are not far behind. \nGates\u2019s and Buffett\u2019s donations will now be put to work primarily to reduce poverty, disease and premature death in the developing world. According to the Global Forum for Health Research, less than 10 percent of the world\u2019s health research budget is spent on combating conditions that account for 90 percent of the global burden of disease. In the past, diseases that affect only the poor have been of no commercial interest to pharmaceutical manufacturers, because the poor cannot afford to buy their products. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), heavily supported by the Gates Foundation, seeks to change this by guaranteeing to purchase millions of doses of vaccines, when they are developed, that can prevent diseases like malaria. GAVI has also assisted developing countries to immunize more people with existing vaccines: 99 million additional children have been reached to date. By doing this, GAVI claims to have already averted nearly 1.7 million future deaths.\nPhilanthropy on this scale raises many ethical questions: Why are the people who are giving doing so? Does it do any good? Should we praise them for giving so much or criticize them for not giving still more? Is it troubling that such momentous decisions are made by a few extremely wealthy individuals? And how do our judgments about them reflect on our own way of living?\nLet\u2019s start with the question of motives. The rich must \u2014 or so some of us with less money like to assume \u2014 suffer sleepless nights because of their ruthlessness in squeezing out competitors, firing workers, shutting down plants or whatever else they have to do to acquire their wealth. When wealthy people give away money, we can always say that they are doing it to ease their consciences or generate favorable publicity. It has been suggested \u2014 by, for example, David Kirkpatrick, a senior editor at Fortune magazine \u2014 that Bill Gates\u2019s turn to philanthropy was linked to the antitrust problems Microsoft had in the U.S. and the European Union. Was Gates, consciously or subconsciously, trying to improve his own image and that of his company? \nThis kind of sniping tells us more about the attackers than the attacked. Giving away large sums, rather than spending the money on corporate advertising or developing new products, is not a sensible strategy for increasing personal wealth. When we read that someone has given away a lot of their money, or time, to help others, it challenges us to think about our own behavior. Should we be following their example, in our own modest way? But if the rich just give their money away to improve their image, or to make up for past misdeeds \u2014 misdeeds quite unlike any we have committed, of course \u2014 then, conveniently, what they are doing has no relevance to what we ought to do.\nA famous story is told about Thomas Hobbes, the 17th-century English philosopher, who argued that we all act in our own interests. On seeing him give alms to a beggar, a cleric asked Hobbes if he would have done this if Christ had not commanded us to do so. Yes, Hobbes replied, he was in pain to see the miserable condition of the old man, and his gift, by providing the man with some relief from that misery, also eased Hobbes\u2019s pain. That reply reconciles Hobbes\u2019s charity with his egoistic theory of human motivation, but at the cost of emptying egoism of much of its bite. If egoists suffer when they see a stranger in distress, they are capable of being as charitable as any altruist.\nFollowers of the 18th-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant would disagree. They think an act has moral worth only if it is done out of a sense of duty. Doing something merely because you enjoy doing it, or enjoy seeing its consequences, they say, has no moral worth, because if you happened not to enjoy doing it, then you wouldn\u2019t do it, and you are not responsible for your likes and dislikes, whereas you are responsible for your obedience to the demands of duty. \nPerhaps some philanthropists are motivated by their sense of duty. Apart from the equal value of all human life, the other \u201csimple value\u201d that lies at the core of the work of the Gates Foundation, according to its Web site, is \u201cTo whom much has been given, much is expected.\u201d That suggests the view that those who have great wealth have a duty to use it for a larger purpose than their own interests. But while such questions of motive may be relevant to our assessment of Gates\u2019s or Buffett\u2019s character, they pale into insignificance when we consider the effect of what Gates and Buffett are doing. The parents whose children could die from rotavirus care more about getting the help that will save their children\u2019s lives than about the motivations of those who make that possible.\nInterestingly, neither Gates nor Buffett seems motivated by the possibility of being rewarded in heaven for his good deeds on earth. Gates told a Time interviewer, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more I could be doing on a Sunday morning\u201d than going to church. Put them together with Andrew Carnegie, famous for his freethinking, and three of the four greatest American philanthropists have been atheists or agnostics. (The exception is John D. Rockefeller.) In a country in which 96 percent of the population say they believe in a supreme being, that\u2019s a striking fact. It means that in one sense, Gates and Buffett are probably less self-interested in their charity than someone like Mother Teresa, who as a pious Roman Catholic believed in reward and punishment in the afterlife. \nMore important than questions about motives are questions about whether there is an obligation for the rich to give, and if so, how much they should give. A few years ago, an African-American cabdriver taking me to the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington asked me if I worked at the bank. I told him I did not but was speaking at a conference on development and aid. He then assumed that I was an economist, but when I said no, my training was in philosophy, he asked me if I thought the U.S. should give foreign aid. When I answered affirmatively, he replied that the government shouldn\u2019t tax people in order to give their money to others. That, he thought, was robbery. When I asked if he believed that the rich should voluntarily donate some of what they earn to the poor, he said that if someone had worked for his money, he wasn\u2019t going to tell him what to do with it. \nAt that point we reached our destination. Had the journey continued, I might have tried to persuade him that people can earn large amounts only when they live under favorable social circumstances, and that they don\u2019t create those circumstances by themselves. I could have quoted Warren Buffett\u2019s acknowledgment that society is responsible for much of his wealth. \u201cIf you stick me down in the middle of Bangladesh or Peru,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019ll find out how much this talent is going to produce in the wrong kind of soil.\u201d The Nobel Prize-winning economist and social scientist Herbert Simon estimated that \u201csocial capital\u201d is responsible for at least 90 percent of what people earn in wealthy societies like those of the United States or northwestern Europe. By social capital Simon meant not only natural resources but, more important, the technology and organizational skills in the community, and the presence of good government. These are the foundation on which the rich can begin their work. \u201cOn moral grounds,\u201d Simon added, \u201cwe could argue for a flat income tax of 90 percent.\u201d Simon was not, of course, advocating so steep a rate of tax, for he was well aware of disincentive effects. But his estimate does undermine the argument that the rich are entitled to keep their wealth because it is all a result of their hard work. If Simon is right, that is true of at most 10 percent of it.\nIn any case, even if we were to grant that people deserve every dollar they earn, that doesn\u2019t answer the question of what they should do with it. We might say that they have a right to spend it on lavish parties, private jets and luxury yachts, or, for that matter, to flush it down the toilet. But we could still think that for them to do these things while others die from easily preventable diseases is wrong. In an article I wrote more than three decades ago, at the time of a humanitarian emergency in what is now Bangladesh, I used the example of walking by a shallow pond and seeing a small child who has fallen in and appears to be in danger of drowning. Even though we did nothing to cause the child to fall into the pond, almost everyone agrees that if we can save the child at minimal inconvenience or trouble to ourselves, we ought to do so. Anything else would be callous, indecent and, in a word, wrong. The fact that in rescuing the child we may, for example, ruin a new pair of shoes is not a good reason for allowing the child to drown. Similarly if for the cost of a pair of shoes we can contribute to a health program in a developing country that stands a good chance of saving the life of a child, we ought to do so.\nPerhaps, though, our obligation to help the poor is even stronger than this example implies, for we are less innocent than the passer-by who did nothing to cause the child to fall into the pond. Thomas Pogge, a philosopher at Columbia University, has argued that at least some of our affluence comes at the expense of the poor. He bases this claim not simply on the usual critique of the barriers that Europe and the United States maintain against agricultural imports from developing countries but also on less familiar aspects of our trade with developing countries. For example, he points out that international corporations are willing to make deals to buy natural resources from any government, no matter how it has come to power. This provides a huge financial incentive for groups to try to overthrow the existing government. Successful rebels are rewarded by being able to sell off the nation\u2019s oil, minerals or timber. \nIn their dealings with corrupt dictators in developing countries, Pogge asserts, international corporations are morally no better than someone who knowingly buys stolen goods \u2014 with the difference that the international legal and political order recognizes the corporations, not as criminals in possession of stolen goods but as the legal owners of the goods they have bought. This situation is, of course, beneficial for the industrial nations, because it enables us to obtain the raw materials we need to maintain our prosperity, but it is a disaster for resource-rich developing countries, turning the wealth that should benefit them into a curse that leads to a cycle of coups, civil wars and corruption and is of little benefit to the people as a whole.\nIn this light, our obligation to the poor is not just one of providing assistance to strangers but one of compensation for harms that we have caused and are still causing them. It might be argued that we do not owe the poor compensation, because our affluence actually benefits them. Living luxuriously, it is said, provides employment, and so wealth trickles down, helping the poor more effectively than aid does. But the rich in industrialized nations buy virtually nothing that is made by the very poor. During the past 20 years of economic globalization, although expanding trade has helped lift many of the world\u2019s poor out of poverty, it has failed to benefit the poorest 10 percent of the world\u2019s population. Some of the extremely poor, most of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa, have nothing to sell that rich people want, while others lack the infrastructure to get their goods to market. If they can get their crops to a port, European and U.S. subsidies often mean that they cannot sell them, despite \u2014 as for example in the case of West African cotton growers who compete with vastly larger and richer U.S. cotton producers \u2014 having a lower production cost than the subsidized producers in the rich nations.\nThe remedy to these problems, it might reasonably be suggested, should come from the state, not from private philanthropy. When aid comes through the government, everyone who earns above the tax-free threshold contributes something, with more collected from those with greater ability to pay. Much as we may applaud what Gates and Buffett are doing, we can also be troubled by a system that leaves the fate of hundreds of millions of people hanging on the decisions of two or three private citizens. But the amount of foreign development aid given by the U.S. government is, at 22 cents for every $100 the nation earns, about the same, as a percentage of gross national income, as Portugal gives and about half that of the U.K. Worse still, much of it is directed where it best suits U.S. strategic interests \u2014 Iraq is now by far the largest recipient of U.S. development aid, and Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan and Afghanistan all rank in the Top 10. Less than a quarter of official U.S. development aid \u2014 barely a nickel in every $100 of our G.N.I. \u2014 goes to the world\u2019s poorest nations.\nAdding private philanthropy to U.S. government aid improves this picture, because Americans privately give more per capita to international philanthropic causes than the citizens of almost any other nation. Even when private donations are included, however, countries like Norway, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands give three or four times as much foreign aid, in proportion to the size of their economies, as the U.S. gives \u2014 with a much larger percentage going to the poorest nations. At least as things now stand, the case for philanthropic efforts to relieve global poverty is not susceptible to the argument that the government has taken care of the problem. And even if official U.S. aid were better-directed and comparable, relative to our gross domestic product, with that of the most generous nations, there would still be a role for private philanthropy. Unconstrained by diplomatic considerations or the desire to swing votes at the United Nations, private donors can more easily avoid dealing with corrupt or wasteful governments. They can go directly into the field, working with local villages and grass-roots organizations. \nNor are philanthropists beholden to lobbyists. As The New York Times reported recently, billions of dollars of U.S. aid is tied to domestic goods. Wheat for Africa must be grown in America, although aid experts say this often depresses local African markets, reducing the incentive for farmers there to produce more. In a decision that surely costs lives, hundreds of millions of condoms intended to stop the spread of AIDS in Africa and around the world must be manufactured in the U.S., although they cost twice as much as similar products made in Asia. \nIn other ways, too, private philanthropists are free to venture where governments fear to tread. Through a foundation named for his wife, Susan Thompson Buffett, Warren Buffett has supported reproductive rights, including family planning and pro-choice organizations. In another unusual initiative, he has pledged $50 million for the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s plan to establish a \u201cfuel bank\u201d to supply nuclear-reactor fuel to countries that meet their nuclear-nonproliferation commitments. The idea, which has been talked about for many years, is widely agreed to be a useful step toward discouraging countries from building their own facilities for producing nuclear fuel, which could then be diverted to weapons production. It is, Buffett said, \u201can investment in a safer world.\u201d Though it is something that governments could and should be doing, no government had taken the first step. \nAid has always had its critics. Carefully planned and intelligently directed private philanthropy may be the best answer to the claim that aid doesn\u2019t work. Of course, as in any large-scale human enterprise, some aid can be ineffective. But provided that aid isn\u2019t actually counterproductive, even relatively inefficient assistance is likely to do more to advance human wellbeing than luxury spending by the wealthy. \nThe rich, then, should give. But how much should they give? Gates may have given away nearly $30 billion, but that still leaves him sitting at the top of the Forbes list of the richest Americans, with $53 billion. His 66,000-square-foot high-tech lakeside estate near Seattle is reportedly worth more than $100 million. Property taxes are about $1 million. Among his possessions is the Leicester Codex, the only handwritten book by Leonardo da Vinci still in private hands, for which he paid $30.8 million in 1994. Has Bill Gates done enough? More pointedly, you might ask: if he really believes that all lives have equal value, what is he doing living in such an expensive house and owning a Leonardo Codex? Are there no more lives that could be saved by living more modestly and adding the money thus saved to the amount he has already given?\nYet we should recognize that, if judged by the proportion of his wealth that he has given away, Gates compares very well with most of the other people on the Forbes 400 list, including his former colleague and Microsoft co-founder, Paul Allen. Allen, who left the company in 1983, has given, over his lifetime, more than $800 million to philanthropic causes. That is far more than nearly any of us will ever be able to give. But Forbes lists Allen as the fifth-richest American, with a net worth of $16 billion. He owns the Seattle Seahawks, the Portland Trailblazers, a 413-foot oceangoing yacht that carries two helicopters and a 60-foot submarine. He has given only about 5 percent of his total wealth. \nIs there a line of moral adequacy that falls between the 5 percent that Allen has given away and the roughly 35 percent that Gates has donated? Few people have set a personal example that would allow them to tell Gates that he has not given enough, but one who could is Zell Kravinsky. A few years ago, when he was in his mid-40s, Kravinsky gave almost all of his $45 million real estate fortune to health-related charities, retaining only his modest family home in Jenkintown, near Philadelphia, and enough to meet his family\u2019s ordinary expenses. After learning that thousands of people with failing kidneys die each year while waiting for a transplant, he contacted a Philadelphia hospital and donated one of his kidneys to a complete stranger. \nAfter reading about Kravinsky in The New Yorker, I invited him to speak to my classes at Princeton. He comes across as anguished by the failure of others to see the simple logic that lies behind his altruism. Kravinsky has a mathematical mind \u2014 a talent that obviously helped him in deciding what investments would prove profitable \u2014 and he says that the chances of dying as a result of donating a kidney are about 1 in 4,000. For him this implies that to withhold a kidney from someone who would otherwise die means valuing one\u2019s own life at 4,000 times that of a stranger, a ratio Kravinsky considers \u201cobscene.\u201d\nWhat marks Kravinsky from the rest of us is that he takes the equal value of all human life as a guide to life, not just as a nice piece of rhetoric. He acknowledges that some people think he is crazy, and even his wife says she believes that he goes too far. One of her arguments against the kidney donation was that one of their children may one day need a kidney, and Zell could be the only compatible donor. Kravinsky\u2019s love for his children is, as far as I can tell, as strong as that of any normal parent. Such attachments are part of our nature, no doubt the product of our evolution as mammals who give birth to children, who for an unusually long time require our assistance in order to survive. But that does not, in Kravinsky\u2019s view, justify our placing a value on the lives of our children that is thousands of times greater than the value we place on the lives of the children of strangers. Asked if he would allow his child to die if it would enable a thousand children to live, Kravinsky said yes. Indeed, he has said he would permit his child to die even if this enabled only two other children to live. Nevertheless, to appease his wife, he recently went back into real estate, made some money and bought the family a larger home. But he still remains committed to giving away as much as possible, subject only to keeping his domestic life reasonably tranquil.\nBuffett says he believes in giving his children \u201cenough so they feel they could do anything, but not so much that they could do nothing.\u201d That means, in his judgment, \u201ca few hundred thousand\u201d each. In absolute terms, that is far more than most Americans are able to leave their children and, by Kravinsky\u2019s standard, certainly too much. (Kravinsky says that the hard part is not giving away the first $45 million but the last $10,000, when you have to live so cheaply that you can\u2019t function in the business world.) But even if Buffett left each of his three children a million dollars each, he would still have given away more than 99.99 percent of his wealth. When someone does that much \u2014 especially in a society in which the norm is to leave most of your wealth to your children \u2014 it is better to praise them than to cavil about the extra few hundred thousand dollars they might have given. \nPhilosophers like Liam Murphy of New York University and my colleague Kwame Anthony Appiah at Princeton contend that our obligations are limited to carrying our fair share of the burden of relieving global poverty. They would have us calculate how much would be required to ensure that the world\u2019s poorest people have a chance at a decent life, and then divide this sum among the affluent. That would give us each an amount to donate, and having given that, we would have fulfilled our obligations to the poor. \nWhat might that fair amount be? One way of calculating it would be to take as our target, at least for the next nine years, the Millennium Development Goals, set by the United Nations Millennium Summit in 2000. On that occasion, the largest gathering of world leaders in history jointly pledged to meet, by 2015, a list of goals that include:\nReducing by half the proportion of the world\u2019s people in extreme poverty (defined as living on less than the purchasing-power equivalent of one U.S. dollar per day).\nReducing by half the proportion of people who suffer from hunger.\nEnsuring that children everywhere are able to take a full course of primary schooling.\nEnding sex disparity in education.\nReducing by two-thirds the mortality rate among children under 5.\nReducing by three-quarters the rate of maternal mortality.\nHalting and beginning to reverse the spread of H.I.V./AIDS and halting and beginning to reduce the incidence of malaria and other major diseases.\nReducing by half the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water.\nLast year a United Nations task force, led by the Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs, estimated the annual cost of meeting these goals to be $121 billion in 2006, rising to $189 billion by 2015. When we take account of existing official development aid promises, the additional amount needed each year to meet the goals is only $48 billion for 2006 and $74 billion for 2015. \nNow let\u2019s look at the incomes of America\u2019s rich and superrich, and ask how much they could reasonably give. The task is made easier by statistics recently provided by Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, economists at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, Paris-Jourdan, and the University of California, Berkeley, respectively, based on U.S. tax data for 2004. Their figures are for pretax income, excluding income from capital gains, which for the very rich are nearly always substantial. For simplicity I have rounded the figures, generally downward. Note too that the numbers refer to \u201ctax units,\u201d that is, in many cases, families rather than individuals.\nPiketty and Saez\u2019s top bracket comprises 0.01 percent of U.S. taxpayers. There are 14,400 of them, earning an average of $12,775,000, with total earnings of $184 billion. The minimum annual income in this group is more than $5 million, so it seems reasonable to suppose that they could, without much hardship, give away a third of their annual income, an average of $4.3 million each, for a total of around $61 billion. That would still leave each of them with an annual income of at least $3.3 million.\nNext comes the rest of the top 0.1 percent (excluding the category just described, as I shall do henceforth). There are 129,600 in this group, with an average income of just over $2 million and a minimum income of $1.1 million. If they were each to give a quarter of their income, that would yield about $65 billion, and leave each of them with at least $846,000 annually.\nThe top 0.5 percent consists of 575,900 taxpayers, with an average income of $623,000 and a minimum of $407,000. If they were to give one-fifth of their income, they would still have at least $325,000 each, and they would be giving a total of $72 billion.\nComing down to the level of those in the top 1 percent, we find 719,900 taxpayers with an average income of $327,000 and a minimum of $276,000. They could comfortably afford to give 15 percent of their income. That would yield $35 billion and leave them with at least $234,000.\nFinally, the remainder of the nation\u2019s top 10 percent earn at least $92,000 annually, with an average of $132,000. There are nearly 13 million in this group. If they gave the traditional tithe \u2014 10 percent of their income, or an average of $13,200 each \u2014 this would yield about $171 billion and leave them a minimum of $83,000.\nYou could spend a long time debating whether the fractions of income I have suggested for donation constitute the fairest possible scheme. Perhaps the sliding scale should be steeper, so that the superrich give more and the merely comfortable give less. And it could be extended beyond the Top 10 percent of American families, so that everyone able to afford more than the basic necessities of life gives something, even if it is as little as 1 percent. Be that as it may, the remarkable thing about these calculations is that a scale of donations that is unlikely to impose significant hardship on anyone yields a total of $404 billion \u2014 from just 10 percent of American families. \nObviously, the rich in other nations should share the burden of relieving global poverty. The U.S. is responsible for 36 percent of the gross domestic product of all Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations. Arguably, because the U.S. is richer than all other major nations, and its wealth is more unevenly distributed than wealth in almost any other industrialized country, the rich in the U.S. should contribute more than 36 percent of total global donations. So somewhat more than 36 percent of all aid to relieve global poverty should come from the U.S. For simplicity, let\u2019s take half as a fair share for the U.S. On that basis, extending the scheme I have suggested worldwide would provide $808 billion annually for development aid. That\u2019s more than six times what the task force chaired by Sachs estimated would be required for 2006 in order to be on track to meet the Millennium Development Goals, and more than 16 times the shortfall between that sum and existing official development aid commitments.\nIf we are obliged to do no more than our fair share of eliminating global poverty, the burden will not be great. But is that really all we ought to do? Since we all agree that fairness is a good thing, and none of us like doing more because others don\u2019t pull their weight, the fair-share view is attractive. In the end, however, I think we should reject it. Let\u2019s return to the drowning child in the shallow pond. Imagine it is not 1 small child who has fallen in, but 50 children. We are among 50 adults, unrelated to the children, picnicking on the lawn around the pond. We can easily wade into the pond and rescue the children, and the fact that we would find it cold and unpleasant sloshing around in the knee-deep muddy water is no justification for failing to do so. The \u201cfair share\u201d theorists would say that if we each rescue one child, all the children will be saved, and so none of us have an obligation to save more than one. But what if half the picnickers prefer staying clean and dry to rescuing any children at all? Is it acceptable if the rest of us stop after we have rescued just one child, knowing that we have done our fair share, but that half the children will drown? We might justifiably be furious with those who are not doing their fair share, but our anger with them is not a reason for letting the children die. In terms of praise and blame, we are clearly right to condemn, in the strongest terms, those who do nothing. In contrast, we may withhold such condemnation from those who stop when they have done their fair share. Even so, they have let children drown when they could easily have saved them, and that is wrong. \nSimilarly, in the real world, it should be seen as a serious moral failure when those with ample income do not do their fair share toward relieving global poverty. It isn\u2019t so easy, however, to decide on the proper approach to take to those who limit their contribution to their fair share when they could easily do more and when, because others are not playing their part, a further donation would assist many in desperate need. In the privacy of our own judgment, we should believe that it is wrong not to do more. But whether we should actually criticize people who are doing their fair share, but no more than that, depends on the psychological impact that such criticism will have on them, and on others. This in turn may depend on social practices. If the majority are doing little or nothing, setting a standard higher than the fair-share level may seem so demanding that it discourages people who are willing to make an equitable contribution from doing even that. So it may be best to refrain from criticizing those who achieve the fair-share level. In moving our society\u2019s standards forward, we may have to progress one step at a time.\nFor more than 30 years, I\u2019ve been reading, writing and teaching about the ethical issue posed by the juxtaposition, on our planet, of great abundance and life-threatening poverty. Yet it was not until, in preparing this article, I calculated how much America\u2019s Top 10 percent of income earners actually make that I fully understood how easy it would be for the world\u2019s rich to eliminate, or virtually eliminate, global poverty. (It has actually become much easier over the last 30 years, as the rich have grown significantly richer.) I found the result astonishing. I double-checked the figures and asked a research assistant to check them as well. But they were right. Measured against our capacity, the Millennium Development Goals are indecently, shockingly modest. If we fail to achieve them \u2014 as on present indications we well might \u2014 we have no excuses. The target we should be setting for ourselves is not halving the proportion of people living in extreme poverty, and without enough to eat, but ensuring that no one, or virtually no one, needs to live in such degrading conditions. That is a worthy goal, and it is well within our reach. ",

    "text": "The Heartland Dissident\n2006-02-12T05:00:00.000Z\nWith a bluntness that seems habitual -- and more than occasionally strikes fellow Republicans as disloyal -- Senator Chuck Hagel started voicing skepticism about the Bush administration's fixation on Iraq as a place to fight the Global War on Terror more than half a year before the president gave the go-ahead for the assault. What the senator said in public was milder than what he said in private conversations with foreign-policy gurus like Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser in another Bush administration, or his friend Colin Powell, the secretary of state, who thought he still had a chance to steer the administration on a diplomatic course. The Nebraskan wanted to believe Powell but, deep down, felt the White House wasn't going to be diverted from its drive to topple Saddam Hussein. When he rose on the Senate floor that October to explain his vote in favor of the resolution authorizing force -- he'd persuaded himself that his vote might strengthen Powell's hand -- he gave a speech that would have required no editing had he decided to vote against it. What sounded then to the venture's true believers like the scolding of a Cassandra sounds fairly obvious three and a half years later, which is to say that Hagel's words can reasonably be read as prescient: \"How many of us really know and understand Iraq, its country, history, people and role in the Arab world?. . .The American people must be told of the long-term commitment, risk and cost of this undertaking. We should not be seduced by the expectations of dancing in the streets.\" The president had said \"precious little\" about post-Saddam Iraq, which could prove costly, Hagel warned, \"in both American blood and treasure.\"\nAs the months and years wore on, Senator Hagel's public musings on Iraq became less measured, as if his gorge rose a little higher with each day's casualty report. He would say that the White House was out of touch with reality, that the reconstruction effort in Iraq was \"beyond pitiful,\" that he had lost confidence in Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, that we were losing the war and had destabilized the Middle East, that the United States was getting \"bogged down\" in Iraq the way it had been in Vietnam. Some of these observations flew into print during the 2004 presidential race, and one of them, the \"beyond pitiful\" line, was seized upon by John Kerry, the Democratic candidate, in his second debate with President Bush. At the Republican grass roots in Nebraska and in the upper reaches of his party in Washington, the senator's candor was not universally viewed as refreshing. His timing was held against him even more than his dissent. (\"Maybe his criticisms are valid,\" a letter to The Omaha World-Herald said, \"but why showcase them and lend credence to the liberal opposition?\") Obviously, this was not a team player. Some of his closest friends and supporters fretted that he was killing whatever small chance he might have had to be the national candidate he plainly aspired to be. Now -- 33 months before a presidential election, two years before the first primaries -- his chances aren't merely discounted; he's seldom even mentioned in Republican circles, as if he has been sidelined by his independence on Iraq.\nThe fact that Hagel himself emerged with two Purple Hearts from Vietnam, where he served as an enlisted man in the infantry, has often been mentioned in news reports quoting him on Iraq as if memories, or maybe nightmares, dating back to the war from which he still carried bits of shrapnel in his chest were primary and extenuating factors shaping his seemingly irrepressible utterances on the latest intervention, his regular brushes with apostasy. Compelling as it is, Chuck Hagel's history as an ordinary soldier, a grunt from small-town Middle America who grew up to be a senator, is more layered, less simple. Unlike Senator Kerry, he had never been a Vietnam veteran against the war. Unlike his own younger brother Tom -- with whom, against standard Army practice on exposing brothers to risk, he walked point in the same infantry unit -- he supported that war to the bitter end. The brothers continued to argue about it for another 25 years until the older one's experience of the world as a globetrotting businessman and his autodidact forays into history and foreign-policy discourse brought him to more or less the same place that Tom (now a law professor in Dayton, Ohio, and a Democrat) had reached in instant, visceral reaction to the experience of jungle war.\nChuck Hagel never became a dove, but he became a bird that's nearly as rare in the Republican aviary. He became an internationalist, someone who's capable of feeling intensely about alliances, multilateral endeavors, the value of global institutions; a fellow traveler of the Council on Foreign Relations, a politician who actually reads Foreign Affairs. A singular Great Plains Republican, in other words, who cares about the rest of the world for reasons that don't begin and end with agricultural exports. Tellingly, when he was elected to the Senate in 1996, he was the one new Republican whose first choice for a committee assignment was the Foreign Relations Committee, which had declined steadily in prestige since the Vietnam-era days of a Democratic chairman he sometimes mentions as a role model, J. William Fulbright. An instinctive and unwavering conservative on most issues -- in particular, big government and deficits -- he was the antithesis of a neocon, a profile to which The Weekly Standard paid backhanded tribute in 2002 when it included him (along with Powell, Scowcroft and The New York Times) in what it called \"the axis of appeasement.\" In the cruelest cut, in that brief period of easy, triumphalist anticipation before the invasion and its turbulent aftermath, National Review put Nebraska's senior senator down as Senator Hagel (R., France).\nIf his tendency to fall out of step with the administration and to ignore talking points sent around by the Republican National Committee has been most conspicuous on foreign affairs, he has been just as much his own man on domestic issues. (\"Nothing in my oath of office,\" he recently told reporters, \"says, 'I pledge allegiance to the Republican Party and President Bush.' \") The senator from Nebraska broke with his party leadership to vote against the new prescription-drug program under Medicare, the No Child Left Behind bill and a big farm bill stuffed with incentives for corporate agriculture. Each, he felt, was ill conceived in practical terms and unwarranted as an expansion of federal mandates and spending. Only on the Bush tax cuts -- all of which he has supported -- has he been deaf to warnings about the consequences for the federal deficit. (Though, he says, he'd never take \"the pledge\" to oppose any and all tax hikes.)\nIt can be argued, as David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union, pointed out, that Hagel has taken a more conservative position than the Bush administration every time he has broken with it on a major issue. Keene's outfit gave the senator a 100 percent rating for his votes in 2003. His lifetime rating for his first eight years in the Senate stood at 85 on the union's scorecard, which translates into baseball talk as better than a .300 batting average. Here's a certified conservative, then, who has regularly decried partisanship -- even during the do-or-die Florida showdown in 2000, when he suggested a statewide recount -- and doesn't go on about \"values.\" (He has them; most people have them, he says, so seeking to impose one's own values on others isn't right.) A regular churchgoer, an Episcopalian who sends his two children to Catholic school, he thinks religion is a private matter. In today's partisan climate, what are so-called movement conservatives to make of such a man? Facing conservative audiences, he struggles to overcome the suspicion that he's unpredictable, a throwback to old-school G.O.P. moderation, a dissident.\nThat suspicion isn't altogether baseless. Hagel is typically more interested in facts on the ground than doctrine. For instance, while he's reliably anti-abortion -- earning a legislative rating of 100 from the Christian Coalition in 2004 -- he's ready to think through an issue that's a litmus test for some religious groups without bothering to figure out what it might cost him. I asked whether he, like the Bush administration, resisted assistance to groups that distribute condoms in the fight against AIDS in Africa. The senator didn't have a potted answer, so I got to watch him think. He said he thought the United States should be careful about the conditions it lays down; he also had no problem with contraception, he said. As far as I could tell, the answer had come through unfiltered, without political calculation.\nNone of this easily adds up to a mandate to seek the presidential nomination of the Republican Party, even if you're the senator and happen to believe strongly that the party has lost its way at home and abroad. Hagel leaves no doubt that this is how he feels, even when he's trying to hold in check the reflexive, often surprising directness that makes him a favorite on Sunday-morning TV gab shows. (\"I sometimes question whether I'm in the same party I started off in,\" he will say. Or, \"This party that sometimes I don't recognize anymore has presided over the largest growth of government in the history of this country and maybe even the history of man.\") Though he can be scathing about the Bush administration's policies, he almost always avoids direct criticism of the president (except to express astonishment that a Republican could go five years without vetoing a single spending bill). He also doesn't praise him.\nThe problem with making a revival of old-time values of fiscal restraint at home and restraint in the use of American power abroad the starting point for a race is that it presumes a level of disillusion that latter-day Republicans -- the people who'll vote in primaries in 2008 -- show little sign of feeling. Even when George W. Bush was bottoming out in national polls, Republicans gave him a favorability rating of about 80 percent. Nevertheless, Chuck Hagel is still thinking hard about running, even though party professionals place him at the back of the pack; even though running would more than likely entail standing against John McCain, whom he supported in 2000, one of only four senators to do so, and his closest neighbor in the Russell Senate Office Building. McCain, a former naval officer who calls Hagel \"Sergeant,\" is not only another Vietnam vet and therefore a soul mate, he's also the member of the Republican caucus, Hagel will say even now, who has the best shot at giving the party a new direction and balance. But, among other things, they've differed on Iraq.\nBefore he can worry about potential rivals, Hagel says, he has to look into himself to see if he has the mettle and ideas needed to offset the disadvantages that make also-rans of senators who discover their Washington experience and voting records only handicap them when they go up against fresh-faced governors able to boast that they're not part of the problem. A veteran of previous administrations who's in fairly regular touch with the senator said he admired him for his seriousness and \"brain power,\" his fresh and independent approach to the toughest issues in foreign affairs especially, but hadn't yet detected the \"single-minded zeal\" that marks successful candidates for the highest office. Judged as a possible president, the former official said, Hagel could be considered impressive, but judged as a possible candidate, he seemed \"basically a dilettante.\"\nMichael McCarthy, an Omaha merchant banker who once made Chuck Hagel president of his investment bank and is now among his most stalwart backers, said he doubted that Hagel could get very far in presidential politics. But he didn't rule out a race. \"Chuck's a complicated guy,\" he said. \"He thinks with the clarity of an actuary but decides with the heart of an Irishman, so I don't know where at the end of the day he'll land. He sure as hell can overcome doubt and decide to go where his heart tells him to.\"\nThe issue that could propel him into the campaign is not one on which candidacies normally rise or fall. Call it the issue of competence. Hagel is a small-government man who believes government can be made to work, that it should be managed well. And while he doesn't exactly say that the current administration has been careless and incompetent, that theme cries out between the lines of much of what he does say. After the botched reconstruction of Iraq and the nonchalant response to the hurricane on the Gulf Coast, it's not a stretch to hear an implied critique when he says, as he did talking to local reporters in Ames, Iowa, last fall, that the president should \"stay focused on governing the country\" and \"reach out to Congress.\" It was a polite way of saying the president had done neither. Later, in an interview in his Senate office, I asked how he thought history would judge George W. Bush. He said it would be \"rather harsh\" if things continued for the next three years the way they've gone for the last five. The verdict would depend on Iraq, \"on what happens to the deficit and the debt and some of these issues we've not paid attention to over the last five years.\" His list of \"these things\" is familiar and long, in both foreign and domestic affairs. It includes global warming, an issue Hagel has fastened on ever since sponsoring a Congressional resolution with Senator Robert Byrd, the Democratic elder from West Virginia, that opposed the Kyoto Protocol because it placed no caps on emissions by rising industrial powers like China and India; on climate change, he feels strongly, the Bush White House has muffed a chance to demonstrate that conservatives can say something more useful than no, that they can actually advance ideas and programs.\nAn earnest legislator who seeks to legislate across a broad range of big, looming issues, Hagel managed to pass a couple of bills that offered corporations loan guarantees and tax breaks to come up with processes and devices that limit greenhouse gases. Unlike the administration, he actually got to the point of drafting a Social Security reform bill. And finding allies across party lines -- Tom Daschle of South Dakota in the last session, Barack Obama of Illinois as well as a fellow Republican, Mel Martinez, in this one -- he shaped a package of immigration-reform bills that aim to create a system that's not dysfunctional: tough on illegals coming into the country, not impossible for illegals who are already here and manageable for employers who want to obey the law. (To understand why a Nebraska senator might interest himself in immigration issues, it's enough to visit an Omaha meatpacking plant. On the cutting floor, the universal language is Spanish.)\n\"Competent Governance\" may not be a slogan to set Republican pulses racing; and pledging to be \"a uniter rather than a divider\" and to be \"humble\" in dealings with the rest of the world are, in any case, themes that have already been tried. Recently, instead of the pallid term \"competence,\" Hagel has been talking about \"competitiveness\" as he tries to find language that will give some urgency to his sense that the party in power, his party, has failed to address issues that are just as urgent as terrorism.\nIt may say something about the politics of \"tending to the base\" that Chuck Hagel appears today to be the longest of long shots, for he's a politician with attributes that are supposedly sought by the people who package candidates and by the casual, least opinionated voters for whom they package them -- those who drift back and forth between parties, actually deciding elections. The packagers like candidates with what in the trade is called \"a good story.\" Hagel's story wouldn't have to be reshaped by an editor in a cutting room. Voters claim they look for someone who comes across as genuine, talks straight, means what he (or, for argument's sake in the coming campaign, she) says, even if they're not in perfect sync with the candidate on issues. Hagel has that quality of going beyond plausibility to believability, possibly to a fault (in that it sometimes comes with a senatorial tendency to tell you more than you wanted to know; a related liability is that he likes to write his own speeches, which he weighs down with lessons of history and high-minded quotations from his reading, as if he feels a need to show how studious he is).\nA Republican campaign pro, after an astute analysis of Hagel's virtues and drawbacks, zeroed in on a factor no one else had mentioned, one that he seemed to feel said a lot about the reason Hagel's party hasn't warmed to him, and therefore about his limited prospects.\n\"He doesn't have a happy face,\" the pro said.\nThat's something a good story -- real life, in other words -- can do to a person.\nIt's not that Chuck Hagel can't flash a smile. I watched him in Iowa patiently pose with members of his audience who lined up to have their pictures snapped. The strain started to show only after seven or eight little flashes. He also laughs easily, at his own jokes and others'. A tireless networker and campaigner who revels in small-town parades, he never seems to need prompting to attach a name to a face. But his gregariousness, the habit of a lifetime, takes concentration. When he's small-talking his way around a room, he seems to lean into conversations; and his fingers are usually working, if not grabbing elbows or patting shoulders, then knitting themselves together or kneading the palms of his hands, as if typing out signals to his brain to remind him he's on stage. If you had to choose a word to describe him at such moments, it might be \"focused,\" even \"conscientious\"; it wouldn't be \"happy.\" Later, while he's waiting to be introduced, his roughly chiseled features may look a little tired or pensive but never less than alert. This is a politician who works at his job.\nThat usually animated, hardly woebegone face has taken more than its share of battering. His nose was broken twice in high school and college football games and at least once more in a fistfight. (There was the fight on a dance floor in Schuyler, Neb., when some players from another school started picking on a pal, and another at a party in Lincoln when he advised some crashers to leave a friend's home.) And there was Vietnam, where the left side of his face was scorched after a mine went off under the armored personnel carrier in which he was riding. Harder to read are the tracings of a difficult childhood, over which Hagel usually drops a kind of scrim to obscure the roughest parts.\nIf he tells the story of his hard-luck dad, who came down with malaria in the Pacific theater, he's apt to leave out the drinking. And if he mentions the binges, it takes some prompting for him to acknowledge the effect on himself, the eldest of four sons. More often he dwells on the conversion of his German-French father -- Charles Dean Hagel, known as Charlie -- to the Roman Catholicism of his Polish-Irish mother and the lead role he then took in building a small church in the town of Ainsworth, where Chuck and Tom became altar boys. Or he humorously turns the fact that the family had homes in seven different small towns that describe a loop around Nebraska into a bountiful political legacy, one that makes it possible for him to say it's good to be home again practically anywhere he campaigns in his state.\nHagel, who will turn 60 this year, was born in North Platte, in western Nebraska, less than a year after his parents were wed, and christened Charles Timothy. They then moved north to Ainsworth, where his dad worked for his own father in a lumberyard, loading and unloading trains. When they couldn't get along, he got himself reassigned to a lumberyard in Rushville, farther west. By then the senator's dad had already been hospitalized twice, for polio and for severe injuries sustained in a fall at the Ainsworth yard. When the family caught up to him in Rushville, he was again in the hospital, this time with a broken back, the result of a car crash when he'd been drinking.\n\"We lived,\" Hagel told me, speaking haltingly, not relishing the details, \"in the basement of this old hotel called the Travelers Hotel in downtown Rushville -- downtown Rushville is like two streets -- and when Dad got out of the hospital, we couldn't find a house. It was like a furnace room. I mean it literally was a furnace room. I mean we had cots down there. It was all dirty. Mice and everything.\" After Rushville came Scotts Bluff, farther west, near the Wyoming border; then Terrytown, just across the Platte River, where his dad would be fired for drinking; then, moving east again, York and the basement of another hotel, the St. Cloud, where young Chuck, by now a freshman in high school, bused tables. \"It was a little better than Rushville,\" he said, \"but not much.\"\nBy then, he was winning notice for his athletic promise and precocious interest in politics. It was 1960, and he was in a Catholic school called St. Joseph's. \"I was the only kid in the school who was for Nixon,\" he said. \"The nuns and priests were wild, just completely wild, for Kennedy, and everyone was very upset with me because I had a picture of Nixon on one of my books.\" It was also about then that he started getting into occasional confrontations with his dad. As he guardedly puts it now, \"Some of it was physical.\" Feeling that he had a responsibility as the eldest, he'd step between his parents when his father, livid with drink, started badgering his mother. I asked whether his dad ever took a swing at him. He paused for a moment, then said, \"Yeh, uh-huh.\" Again he paused. \"Well, you wouldn't swing back at him,\" he went on. \"I'd just push him back.\"\nIn his steadier moments, the father was hugely proud of his eldest son, attending all his games, forecasting a great future for him and seeming not to notice that he was slighting his next in line, Tom, who was not an athlete. At the end of a year in York, the family moved north to Columbus, the easternmost point in its circuit of the state, about 80 miles from Omaha. There his dad had one more drunken smash-up. Then on Christmas morning in 1962, the Hagel boys were startled by the sobbing of their mom, who'd come home from early Mass to find her husband dead in bed at 39 of a heart attack. Chuck, just 16, imagined he had to fill the void.\nn the five years between his dad's death and his departure for Vietnam, the new man of the family was sturdy, attentive to his brothers and rudderless in his own life. His first goal, set by a football scholarship to Wayne State College, was thwarted early on when an injury left him with a pinched nerve in his neck that surgery couldn't correct. He then drifted to the University of Nebraska at Kearney (pronounced Carney) and from there, dropping out on a sudden impulse, to a school of broadcasting in Minneapolis, where he tried to support himself by going door to door near the airport, in an attempt to sign up United Airlines stewardesses for the Encyclopedia Britannica. It would be a smart investment, he'd tell them, for the children they didn't yet have. \"Well, I did make some sales,\" the senator said.\nWhen his number came up at the draft board in January 1967, he went willingly. And when, after training, he received orders to go to Germany, he requested a transfer to Vietnam. He hadn't been touched by anti-war protests. Where he came from, the feeling was that if there was a war on, that's where a young American soldier belonged. In that reflex, which many would still call patriotic, he briefly found a purpose.\nIt's unclear to the two brothers today how they wound up in the same infantry squad. Tom, drafted as soon as he finished high school, went initially to a reconnaissance unit up north, where he saw heavy fighting. He put in for a transfer, hoping to get closer to his brother, who was serving in the south. Soon they were on patrol together in canopied jungle near the Cambodian border. Over a period of about four weeks, each got a chance to save the other's life. When the first incident occurred, on March 28, 1968, their squad leader had just taken them off point and moved them to the middle of the column. One of the soldiers who replaced them hit a trip wire, setting off a mine that had been placed in a tree so that it would detonate at face level. Bodies, body parts and shrapnel were blasted back into the ranks as the squad was crossing a stream. Tom picked himself up and looked for his brother. What he saw, he says, was a \"geyser\" of blood gushing from Chuck's chest. Tom, then only 19, stanched the bleeding and bandaged the wound, only then noticing that he'd been hit himself in the arm. By the time the medevac choppers had taken off the dead and critically wounded, the Hagel boys were deemed well enough to continue on, which meant going off the booby-trapped trail and hacking through thick undergrowth.\nTwenty-five days later, it was Chuck's turn to rescue Tom, when their troop carrier hit a hand-detonated mine as it emerged from a village in the delta. Tom had been in the turret behind a .50-caliber machine gun. He was unconscious, not obviously alive, when his brother got to him. The blast had blown out Chuck's eardrums and severely burned his left side, but knowing the carrier might soon explode, he worked feverishly to pull Tom from the wreckage, then threw his body on top of Tom's as Vietcong fighters in ambush sprayed the area with gunfire.\nChuck left Vietnam in December 1968, Tom the following February. Back in Omaha, they roomed together for a time, then followed separate paths to readjustment to civilian life. Beset by nightmares and feelings of guilt that sent him off on binges, Tom had the most to get over, what seemed to be the harder time. He also had the clearest idea about the war, which seemed to him futile and cruel. Before they could get used to their new lives, their youngest brother, Jimmy, was killed in a car crash at 16, yet another piece of Hagel hard luck.\nIn his reaction to all he'd been through, Hagel mixed repression and a fierce focus on the future. He would do his best to put the war out of his mind, get through his studies finally -- he was in his third college -- and move on. \"I was probably going through something that I didn't quite understand,\" he acknowledges. \"I don't think I'm a person who doesn't reflect, because I do -- I reflect on a lot of things -- but in this case I wanted to get it behind me. . .I wanted a life.\" It happened relatively fast. Working part time as a radio reporter in Omaha, he interviewed the only Republican on the county board, John Y. McCollister, who then was elected to the House of Representatives when Hagel was about to graduate, finally, from the University of Nebraska at Omaha. The young veteran asked the new congressman for help finding a Washington job. A month later, McCollister and his wife invited their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to stay in their home. Soon his boss was bringing him coffee in bed in the mornings and driving him to work. A year and a half after that, Hagel was his chief of staff, at 26.\n\"It wasn't very long before he knew everyone on Capitol Hill,\" McCollister told me. \"That's the history of Chuck Hagel. He meets people easily.\" The subsequent lines on Hagel's dense r\u00e9sum\u00e9 had everything to do with this talent for getting to know people.\nWithin 10 years, as Ronald Reagan swept into the White House, he was well-enough connected in Republican circles to be made the second-ranking official of the Veterans Administration. In that capacity, he turned up as one of the main speakers at the groundbreaking for the Vietnam War Memorial. Five months later, in what might be seen as his first declaration of independence, he quit in open protest against cuts in benefits for Vietnam vets, which he'd resisted unsuccessfully.\nThe resignation opened a new chapter in his life. He would now turn his hand to making money. Cashing in his life-insurance policies and selling his car to his mother and stepfather, he managed to raise $5,000, enough to make him a partner in a batch of new companies that would compete in a lottery for licenses to set up systems for a new kind of telephone that worked without wires. The company he helped found, after stock swaps and the arrival of new partners, grew up into Vanguard Cellular Systems. By the time it went public in 1988, it had become one of the country's biggest cellphone companies, and Chuck Hagel's stake made him a wealthy man. By then he'd traveled to some 15 countries, negotiating with governments, usually unsuccessfully, for contracts to set up wireless systems.\nHe'd also married and remarried. The first marriage lasted less than two years. The Nebraska Catholic then got to know a Mississippi Baptist, Lilibet Ziller, who handled press for the House Veterans' Affairs Committee. Their search for a church where they could both be comfortable led them to St. John's Episcopal Church across from the White House, where they now worship and where their two children were baptized and confirmed. (Hagel realizes that if he were to try a national run, he might be called on to explain his choices in religion to Christian groups that are part of the conservative coalition his party has fused together. He doesn't especially like the idea. \"I don't question or critique any other politician's style, but I know who Chuck Hagel is,\" he said. \"I know what fits me, and I know what fits my wife. Religion is important to us, spirituality is important, but it's also private.\")\nHis financial independence eased his return to the political sphere and made it only a question of time as to when he'd run for office. He toyed briefly with the idea of running for governor of Virginia, then returned to Nebraska in 1992, going to work for Michael McCarthy as an investment banker. One of the companies he looked after, American Information Systems -- later rechristened Election Systems and Software -- manufactured voting machines in partnership with The Omaha World-Herald, the state's biggest daily.\nIt's sometimes said that Nebraska has two Republican parties, one of which calls itself Democrat. That party had won every Senate race for two decades when Hagel started driving from town to town in 1995 to make himself known. In a state with fewer than a million voters, personal contact matters. Dick Robinson, who runs a steel company in the town of Norfolk, said he'd never heard of his visitor when Hagel dropped by to ask for his support. Ten years later, in his skybox at the always-sold-out stadium in Lincoln where the University of Nebraska plays football, Robinson seemed glad to have a distraction from a game the once-indomitable Huskers were giving away to Oklahoma. \"It was great to meet a politician who could look you in the eye and say, 'I disagree,' \" he said. \"We've been fast friends ever since.\"\nalthough their state is one of the two or three most lopsidedly Republican in presidential voting, Nebraskans cling to the notion that their wide open spaces -- populated by nearly four times as many cattle as people -- nurture a spirit of political independence, an indifference to partisanship. Bob Kerrey, a Democrat who couldn't help calling President Clinton \"an unusually good liar,\" is the most recent example. George Norris, a Senate titan for three decades, supported Al Smith in 1928 and Franklin Roosevelt in 1932 against Herbert Hoover while still a Republican, writing an article for Liberty magazine entitled, \"Why I Am a Better Republican Than President Hoover.\"\nChuck Hagel isn't likely to go that far. Having resided full time in Nebraska for only 7 of the last 34 years, he's not apt, in any event, to present himself as a Prairie independent. Viewing himself as a self-made man who started out with nothing besides his own inner resources, he has neither broken with his party nor allowed it to define him. Nor did he wait for his party to decide when it was his turn.\nIn 1996, in his first race, he took on a Republican attorney general in the Senate primary and won by nearly two to one. In the general election, he upset a popular Democratic governor, Ben Nelson, by a margin of 14 percentage points. Realizing too late that he was trailing, Nelson ran attack ads portraying Hagel as a Washington insider who'd used his connections to enrich himself in the cellphone business. Hagel had earlier resisted demands by Alfonse D'Amato of New York, then chairman of the Republican campaign committee in the Senate, that he order up a series of attack ads by a favorite D'Amato demolition specialist.\nStung by Nelson's barrage, Hagel countered with an ad in The Omaha World-Herald calling them \"the most scurrilous and false attacks ever made in Nebraska politics.\" Not the forgiving sort, he has never quite forgotten his grudge against Nelson, who, for the last five years, has been the state's junior senator. Senator Nelson has since been heard to ask how it could be that he managed to get over a big loss while his colleague has yet to get over a big win.\nIn the blogosphere, where conspiracy theories enjoy a certain immortality, the scale of Hagel's upset victories in 1996 made him an object of suspicion after the Florida voting fiasco of 2000. Here was a virtual unknown who'd once been an officer of a company that made the voting machines on which most ballots were cast in Nebraska. But these were scanners, not digital counters; paper ballots survived, available for a recount that neither of his rivals sought. (When he ran for re-election in 2002, he won even bigger, capturing 83 percent of the vote, a Nebraska record. Out on the Web, suspicion lived on.)\nWhat Hagel thought he'd showed in his face-offs with Nelson and D'Amato -- who'd called him a \"prima donna\" (and then some) -- was that heavy reliance on attack ads wasn't a winning strategy. After not quite two years in the Senate, he put himself up for the campaign committee's chairmanship, sending around a manifesto to his colleagues that promised to thin the ranks of consultants as a step toward cleansing \"the political culture in America by 'defining up' the standards of debate, political discourse and campaigns.\" It was a direct challenge to the leadership, which he accused of running \"issueless campaigns.\" And it flopped. His colleagues weren't responsive to his musings on the state of the political culture. They decided that winning was still \"the only thing,\" voting 39-13 in favor of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Not for the last time, Hagel's position was shown to be lonelier than he'd realized.\nHe may not have become a leader of his caucus, but, to the likely dismay of the White House, he's also not an outcast. On a personal level, he's still a man who forges connections. In addition to John McCain, he gets along well with the chairmen of his key committees -- Pat Roberts of Kansas on Intelligence and Richard Lugar of Indiana on Foreign Relations -- and counts Democrats Joe Biden of Delaware and Jack Reed of Rhode Island as among his best friends on the Hill. \"I've been in the Senate a long time, and there's nobody I've liked more than Chuck Hagel,\" Biden told me.\nBy the time of his loss to McConnell, Hagel had nearly persuaded himself that he felt a fresh breeze blowing in the party from Austin, Tex., which he'd visited in April 1998 for a laid-back overnight at the governor's mansion that included a meandering walk through the gardens with his host, a quiet dinner with just George and Laura Bush, then more talk on an upstairs porch. It was the first real encounter between the two and the most time they'd ever spend together.\nHe found Bush \"a very charming, gregarious person,\" and when, several months later, on a swing through Nebraska, he was asked whom he liked as the next Republican nominee, he all but endorsed the Texan, citing his name recognition, success in a big state, age and conservative profile.\nIt proved to be the first time that Bush learned he could not take Chuck Hagel for granted. Before long, John McCain knocked on the Nebraskan's door, divulged his own ambitions and asked his friend to be co-chairman of his campaign. Hagel had to know there were differences in temperament and outlook between himself and McCain, who was more moralistic about international issues, less fascinated by the intricacies of diplomacy, more inclined, perhaps, to brandish military power. But in the Clinton years, these did not loom large. He knew the senator far better than he knew Bush -- who was pretty much a blank on national-security issues anyway -- and admired him, above all, for his readiness to take lonely stands.\nHe was sitting with McCain when the South Carolina primary returns came in following a campaign in which McCain's mental stability was questioned and calls were made to likely Republican voters telling them the former P.O.W. and his wife had a black baby, without mentioning that the little girl had been adopted at an orphanage in Bangladesh. Reached by Don Walton, the respected political reporter of The Lincoln Star Journal, Hagel said Bush had \"sold his soul to the right wing.\" He called it \"the filthiest campaign I've ever seen.\"\n\"I'd say the same thing today,\" he said when I asked about South Carolina, nearly six years later.\nConsidering how he'd disappointed Bush after the attention lavished on him in Austin and what he'd said about South Carolina, it's remarkable that Senator Hagel then found himself on the short list for running mate in 2000. To this day, he doesn't know whether he was seriously in contention. Possibly there was some thought that the former member of the Texas Air National Guard could benefit by picking, or at least appearing to consider, a twice-wounded Vietnam vet. Hagel says he spent $15,000 on accountant fees assembling the information the campaign demanded. Dick Cheney, the chief talent scout, interviewed him twice and sent his son-in-law around to pick up a box of documents before it was discovered that the talent scout was actually the talent.\n\"I still have the box,\" Hagel said. Nothing could be more unanswerable than the question of what might have happened in Iraq had he been picked. It's a testament to the vice president's influence that it even occurs.\nhagel had been to Iraq four times by the time Cheney paid his first visit as vice president in December 2005. Today the war is so much in the front of the senator's mind that it pops into just about any answer he gives to a political question, sometimes more than once. When I asked whether he saw himself as a maverick, his reply boiled down to saying he was a consistent conservative. But here's how it began: \"When I think of issues like Iraq, of how we went into it -- no planning, no preparation, no sense of consequences, of where we were going, how we were going to get out, went in without enough men, no exit strategy, those kind of things -- I'll speak out, I'll go against my party.\"\nA minute later, still chewing on the same question, Hagel was relating the retort of a Nebraska friend to a Republican who'd complained that the senator was still out of step with the president. Pretty much the same litany then tumbled out as, speaking in what was supposed to be the friend's voice, Hagel went on: \"Who's the conservative here? Who votes against the Medicare reform bill, who votes against No Child Left Behind, who votes against the farm bill, who's opposed to invading another country, occupying another country, with no plans, no exit strategy and not enough troops? Now you tell me who the conservative is.\"\nThe trouble with Iraq as an identifying issue for a potential candidate today is that practically everyone except Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and Congressman John Murtha of Pennsylvania, who have flirted with the idea of a deadline for withdrawal, purports to be in essentially the same position with regard to what needs to be happen: hoping that the insurgency will wane, that the Sunnis will somehow be mollified, that the number of U.S. troops can be drawn down this year, that Iraqis will be able to finish the war, more or less on their own. Everyone, for the moment, includes George W. Bush, Hillary Clinton and Chuck Hagel. Some are more hopeful (Bush), and some decidedly less (Hagel). No one now can really know how Iraq will play out in our politics.\nIt's not, in any case, an issue on which Hagel can easily \"position\" himself the way most senators who are not satisfied with being senators would. As this least partisan Republican stews on his decision on whether to go national with his sense of frustration, he has to know that his independence and forthrightness, the qualities that so far have defined him, are also his most obvious limitations in the roughhouse game of presidential politics as we know it. A candidate who worries about the price he may have to pay for anything he says would not have called for active engagement with Iran and Cuba as Hagel has regularly done in foreign-policy speeches over the last several years. And he would probably not be displaying, as Hagel has recently done, a newfound sensitivity on civil liberties matters. Through the end of 2004, Hagel's rating on the legislative scorecard of the American Civil Liberties Union was an anemic 22 percent. But at the end of December, as Congress rushed to adjourn, he was one of only four Republican senators whose votes held up an extension of the Patriot Act, arguing for checks on federal powers to invade homes and private records that had passed the Senate unanimously but then had been dropped in conference.\n\"When government continues to erode individual rights, that's the most dangerous, dangerous threat to freedom there is,\" he said, calling it \"far more dangerous than terrorism.\" His reaction was similarly sharp when he first heard of the report in this newspaper that the president had claimed authority to order domestic wiretapping without court approval. \"If, in fact, this is true,\" he said, \"then it needs to stop.\" When the White House acknowledged it was true, Hagel pressed for Congressional hearings and a national debate. \"I think Congress has failed the country in many ways,\" he said at a forum in California last month. One way was to allow the administration \"to completely overpower the debate based on, 'I'm the commander in chief, and I know what's best.' \"\nAs he road-tests themes for a possible campaign, he argues that his party is running low on ideas for the country's future, so fixated has it been on the threat of terrorism and maintaining itself in power. The importance of terrorism can't be minimized, he hastens to say, but through neglect of research and infrastructure, through failures in education, the country is losing its edge in a competitive world economy. Sure, globalization causes dislocations, this devout free trader and new-economy entrepreneur says, and, sure, the rise of China presents problems, but these are facts of life \"that we are not going to unwind.\" Forty-six years after a senator last made it directly to the White House, he gropes for words in which to talk about national purpose, about a Manhattan Project for alternate energy sources, about getting the country moving again. These themes are in the air; President Bush latched onto them in his State of the Union address in January.\nEarlier in the month, Hagel had already tried them out at a breakfast talk to a conservative group in Orange County, Calif. The breakfast had opened with an invocation in which \"the vision of a former lifeguard called Dutch\" and the American engagement in Iraq had been gratefully cited as part of \"God's plan\" to spread freedom around the globe. That left Hagel sounding a little impious when he gave his cool assessment of the venture on the Euphrates. Iraq may yet work out, he said. \"I don't think it will, but it may.\" But as for the conservative revolution in America, \"Where,\" he asked, \"is Phase 2?\"\nThe audience -- youngish businessfolk who had formed a new political action committee called Atlas, after Ayn Rand's paean to competitiveness, \"Atlas Shrugged\" -- seemed mildly appreciative rather than shocked.\n\"This administration has kept America on such a narrow ledge,\" he remarked after the talk. \"Everything is terrorism.\"\nIn Washington, I asked Senator McCain whether he saw his pal next door as a serious candidate in 2008. The senator, who rode a campaign bus he called the Straight Talk Express in 2000, knows something about the advantages and disadvantages of candor in a national campaign. In this instance he either misconstrued or sidestepped my question. He replied that Hagel was definitely serious, one of the two, three or four leading voices on national security and foreign policy in the Senate. \"Chuck really works at it,\" he said.\nMcCain was an early enthusiast for the war in Iraq, Hagel an early skeptic. Could he imagine the co-chairman of his first national race having a place on a McCain ticket or in a McCain administration? I asked. \"I'd be honored to have Chuck with me in any capacity,\" McCain replied. \"He'd make a great secretary of state.\"\nPropriety and common sense argue that it's too early to place such bets. Hagel isn't ready to have the conversation with McCain that he knows he'll have to have. He's still at the stage of testing audience responses, of looking into faces to see if they give back any hint of encouragement, even recognition. \"Hello,\" he'll say, sticking out his hand to a receptionist or a registration clerk, \"I'm Senator Chuck Hagel.\" He has done it often enough to know that the likely response is a blank stare, but still he persists as he travels beyond Washington and Nebraska, to Los Angeles, New York, Iowa, New Hampshire, even McCain territory -- he had a fund-raiser in Phoenix last month -- trying to identify potential donors and supporters.\nWhatever he concludes, he promises he'll go on saying what he thinks a senator should say about issues as they arise. \"I don't have to be president; I don't have to be a senator,\" he said over dinner in an Omaha steakhouse. \"I have to live with myself.\" More striking than the words was the urgency with which he spoke them. He seemed to be speaking more to himself than his companions, as if repeating a vow. Of course, we know, or think we know, that people who don't have to be president are unlikely to get the chance.\nJoseph Lelyveld is the author most recently of \"Omaha Blues: A Memory Loop\" and a former correspondent and executive editor at The Times.",

    "text": "Talk to the Newsroom:Assistant Managing EditorGerald Marzorati\n2006-07-28T23:33:00.000Z\nGerald Marzorati, assistant managing editor at The Times and editor of The Times Magazine answered reader questions on the weekly magazine, the T Style magazines and other topics, during the week of July 24. \nBefore coming to The Times in 1994, Mr. Marzorati worked as an editor at the New Yorker and at Harper's Magazine.\nSeveral other editors have answered questions in this column in previous weeks: \nBill Keller, executive editor\nJonathan Landman, deputy managing editor\nLaura Chang, science editor\nLarry Ingrassia, business editor\nAlison Mitchell, education editor\nSam Sifton, culture editor\nMichelle McNally, assistant managing editor for photography \nThese discussions will continue in future weeks with other Times editors.\n\nThe Magazine's Place in the Industry\nQ. Mr. Marzorati -- Since you've addressed the differences between newspaper and magazine journalism, I'm hoping you can also write about the differences between magazine journalism at the N.Y. Times and in the rest of the industry. How does your association with the newspaper change the magazine's production and style? Can you imagine how the Sunday magazine would be different if it were independent of The Times?\n-- Jake Tracer\nA. Dear Mr. Tracer -- As anyone who has ever attended a National Magazine Award ceremony can testify (and if you can get out of attending, do) the word \"magazine\" covers a lot of print (and now digital) territory: newsweeklies, literary quarterlies, opinion publications, shelter books (magazine-business jargon for glossies about homes and home furnishings) and a few last, hard-fighting general-interest magazines -- fighting because they face big financial challenges. Advertisers have over the years become increasingly convinced that specialized \"vertical\" magazines (you know, the Extreme Sportser, Starlet With New Baby Again News) are what you, the reader, is passionate about, and passion puts you in the mood to buy. Me, I love general interest magazines, because I love deep reporting, long non-fiction narratives, Big Think, and serendipity. Whatever the bottom-line challenges faced by, say, the Atlantic and the New Yorker, they (along with the New York Review of Books, the New Republic, and, okay, my own favorite ad-free vertical, the Wine Advocate) are the other magazines I read (not skim or look at).\nEvery magazine differs from other magazines, and The Times Magazine, a general-interest magazine, differs from these other general-interest magazines, most obviously, in that our delivery system is not the newsstand or the postal service, but The Times itself. I see that as a pure blessing. Nearly 2 million people buy The Sunday Times, they're a national, educated, informed readership and they get the magazine on Sunday morning, when they are most likely to have time to read the long-form pieces we like to publish. Top journalists like reporting and writing for us because they want to reach our audience. And, despite being a general-interest magazine, a lot of advertisers like us too. And advertisers -- I mention this because a surprising number of readers writing to me this week seem to have a problem with \"too much\" advertising or \"gas guzzler\" advertising or \"all those underfed women in weird clothes\" advertising -- ALLOW US TO STAY IN BUSINESS! Did you guys grow up reading Pravda? \nMagazine vs. Newspaper Journalism\nQ. Dear Mr. Marzorati -- I'm a high school student interested in both magazine and newspaper journalism, and I've been wondering about the differences between the mediums. What challenges do magazine editors and writers face that those on a newspaper do not?\n-- Jim Santel, St. Louis\nA. When I was in high school, in the late 1960's, I discovered long-form magazine journalism, which was having a real breakthrough moment in publications like Esquire, New York, the New Yorker and the Saturday Evening Post. Writers like Joan Didion, Gay Talese, Tom Wolfe and John McPhee were experimenting with voice, narrative structure and point-of-view. These literary devices were the things I was learning about in my English class, reading Balzac and F. Scott Fitzgerald, but these magazines writers were writing 10,000-, 15,000-word stories; true stories based in reporting and facts, about the America I was living in. I couldn't wait to get to study hall, get a pass to the library and see what had arrived in the magazine rack. I can still see myself sitting and reading the pieces, as -- nearly 40 years on -- I now sit in my office and read the pieces, except they're ones I've assigned.\nI begin with that because I think as you begin to think about journalism, you should picture how it is you might want to spend your days. Teachers and guidance counselors don't talk that way often enough. You might want to be writing -- but do you want to be home alone writing all day (like magazine writers) or in a bustling newsroom (like newspaper reporters)? Do you want to go home from work at the end of the day knowing you will see in print the next morning the fruits of your labor (like newspaper people) or would you rather immerse yourself in a story or subject for a longer period of time (like magazine people)? \nWhat I'm saying is I think you can tell the difference between a newspaper and a magazine. What you might want to think about is the difference between a newspaper and magazine life.\nBest of luck, whichever choice you make.\nSurge in Corrections?\nQ. Gerald, I've noticed the New York Times Sunday Magazine has already published 21 corrections for 2006, up significantly from last year, when it had 8 corrections, and in 2004, only 4 corrections were published.\nWhat's the reason for this sudden surge in corrections? Has The Times cut back on copy editors or eliminated fact checkers, perhaps? Or has the content of the magazine become more current, making deadlines tighter, and therefore increasing the margin for error?\n-- Bill Lucey\nA. Dear Bill -- I don't have the numbers in front of me, and don't have the time (what with Lebanon and Israel and an issue to close tomorrow) to track them down. My first reaction is to not believe we had so few corrections in previous years. We publish upwards of 20,000 words each Sunday, and that would mean that among the, say, 100,000 sentences we publish annually, fewer than ten have some factual error or another?\nBut let's assume (and I do assume) that you are roughly right -- that is to say, that the number of corrections in the magazine is trending upward. I'd point to two factors: 1) We at The Times are less and less reluctant to correct even the tiniest mistakes. I remember one from earlier this year that appeared in an article about Michael Steele, who is running for the Senate in Maryland. We had referred to a university where he spoke as Salisbury State. Nope, it's now Salisbury University. This is hardly a credibility breaker, but, for the record, we corrected it. 2) You, our readers, are in better touch with us, thanks to technology, and let us know big-time when he goof. I seem to recall that more than once this year we have published corrections of recipes -- mistakes brought to our attention by irate cooks and eaters. \nThat said, we editors, reporters and fact-checkers here struggle mightily each week to get things right -- get things right by double-checking with officials in China in the middle of our night and officers in Iraq on sat phones as well as recipe writers down the hall. My stomach churns every time we don't get something right, and it pleases me a lot when I get to the bottom of a proof I'm reading of the letters pages and find no correction there. \nChoosing the Cover\nQ. How are the images for the cover of the magazine chosen? I don't suspect a hidden conspiracy, but I have noticed that a high percentage of covers feature men -- and close-ups at that. Even covers which feature gender-neutral topics seem to feature male figures more often than female ones. Just wondering if this very causal observation is at all accurate, and if so, why?\n-- Janice Murabayashi, San Diego, Calif.\nA. Dear Ms. Murabayashi -- Choosing the cover image is a collaboration between the art director, the photo editor and myself, often with input from another editor or two and sometimes the author of the cover story. When I read what you wrote, about noticing a high percentage of covers featuring men, I got up and walked to the office next door, where we always have the previous 18 covers on a wall. It turns out -- at least from this sample -- that you've noticed wrong. Of the 18, 11 were what we call \"concept\" covers: paintings or illustrations of objects or items (a condom package for a cover story on contraception, for example). None of these showed a man. Four featured photographs of women: a refugee in Darfur, an illegal immigrant, a child actress (and her mom), and, just last week, a female child-welfare worker. Only three covers featured photographs of men: a Muslim immigrant in London, an Islamic televangelist and an Iraq-war vet. And only the televangelist was a close-up.\nMaybe you confused us with Esquire.\nThinking Up the Funny Pages\nQ. First off, let me write a big thanks. I love the magazine, best part of the Sunday paper. Regrettably, I can't get The Times over here in Iraq and reading the mag online just isn't the same. The other day I was up in Mosul. An officer I had a meeting with up there had a big stack of The Times with one of the magazines on top behind his desk, which I eyed jealously throughout the meetings. His wife must have mailed them to him. \nAnyway, my question: How did you make the decision to add the story/comic book section? I read the explanation why in that edition and I kind of buy it. What I'd like to know is how you came to the decision and how did you pick those particular categories? It seems like such a break with the direction of the magazine. Thanks much and keep up the good work! \n-- CDR Brendan McLane\nA. Dear Commander (have I got that right?) McLane -- Your letter has already made my day, not just that you like the magazine, but -- speaking as a general-interest-magazine editor, that is, as someone who lives to reach the generally curious reader -- that you wrote me from Iraq not to pick apart our coverage of the war but to inquire about comics and stuff!\nIn one respect, you embody the reason I was interested in scheming up the Funny Pages. In the post-9/11 world, a lot of our pages are being devoted to Iraq and, more generally, to national security and the war on terror. I wanted there to be a place in the magazine that was escapist. I count on attracting readers who want to be informed, of course, but I also count on attracting readers who want to be entertained -- hence the crossword puzzle, the Ethicist column, and so on. We reach readers on Sunday morning, when a quiet break from the world, an escape, may be precisely what they have in mind.\nThe other big thing I had in mind was finding some way to evoke the funny pages of old-timey Sunday papers (though not of the Times, which never had them) in a contemporary way, and here, our popular culture presented a prefect opportunity. To me, the graphic novel -- the book-length narrative told in comics-style by artists like Chris Ware and others -- is one of the most vibrant young mediums we have. Ditto a new kind of humor writing which is neither jokey nor satirical but memoirish and oddball, a kind of writing that has popped up in recent years at reading nights in clubs and bars in New York, and on the public-radio show \"This American Life.\" (As it happens, two of the people here involved in the Funny Pages, Paul Tough and John Hodgman, have produced things for \"This American Life.\" Hodgman also now has the strangest moonlighting gig any writer at the magazine has ever had -- he plays the tweedy PC in the new Apple TV commercials.) The third feature of the Funny Pages is serial fiction, and, again, I happen to think we are living in a terrific era for genre fiction -- that is crime, detective, and legal-thriller fiction -- and since no other magazine was publishing it, why not us?\nYou are right, it's a break with the tradition of the magazine -- with The Times as a whole, for that matter. But as we seek out new readers across the country and around the globe (via the Web), I suspect we'll be doing a lot more things that haven't been done before. Now, as a lot of letter writers have made clear, the Funny Pages are not for everyone, but as a lot of other letter-writers (especially younger ones) have made clear, they love them. Me, I want readers to find something to like in the magazine each week, and then take a bike ride or play with the kids. Hey, it's Sunday.\nYou keep safe.\n\nBroadsheets, Tabloids, Etc.\nQ. Dear Sir, Do you foresee magazine size dailies in the future? This should not be funny. Broadsheets are becoming tabloids - the reason is their handiness. Mags are handier. So why not dailies take shape of magazines? Thanks and regards.\n-- Shamsuddin Ahmed, Dhaka, Bangladesh\nA. Dear Shamsuddin Ahmed -- I'm not sure about a daily Times magazine of one sort or another -- because of the production values editors and readers alike seek from a magazine, they take longer to design and print than newspapers. Also, magazine paper stock is more expensive than newsprint, and that would be a factor. But it would not surprise me at all in the coming years if there are more Times magazines, with one of more of them distributed during the week. \nThere is also the whole questions of magazines on the Web. A number of good ones are already out there. But these are almost exclusively sites devoted to commentary or information, factual and not. Who will invent the first great Web equivalent of a glossy? And, if I may speak as a publisher, who will advertise (magazines tend to attract luxury brand advertising, which is not a huge presence on the Web yet) and what form will this advertising take (videos perhaps?).\nWho Reads T?\nQ. Sir -- T Magazine is a beautiful book with great pictures and interesting contributors, but I am baffled by who you think reads T. While I'm sure that The Times has a far more affluent average reader than most newspapers, the rest of us enjoy the Sunday paper just as much. Do you really have a significant readership that's going to plunk down over $1000 for a suitcase, as was featured in one of your recent pieces, or do your editors think such things are aspirational? Even Vogue has learned to throw in one or two affordable items on a page to keep the rest of us interested. Who is your target reader?\nRespectfully,\nAlexandra Farkas, Brooklyn, NY\nA. Dear Ms. Farkas -- I have received a number of thoughtful letters similar to yours, from readers puzzled by -- or, frankly, contemptuous of -\u2013 our new style and luxury magazine, T, so indulge me a bit as I try to answer your question by answering what I sense is the underlying question (and perhaps the underlying question to or about editors like me on the minds of many, many of the Times\u2019 readers). Yours is ultimately a question (again, like so many posed by readers) about bias \u2013- in this case, a bias toward the rich and their shopping habits. And my answer is that while I do not think the paper, in its news section, is biased toward liberals, or biased in favor of (or against!) Israel, I do think, in cultural matters \u2013- of which fashion and, more broadly, style, is one expression -- we are biased (in terms of space devoted to coverage, photography and so on) toward the rich. And the reason we are is that The Times, though not to my mind a simply liberal paper or a pro- or anti-Israeli paper, is an urbane, cosmopolitan paper edited from the world capital of urbanity and cosmopolitanism, Manhattan, which means we are biased in favor of change, possibility, mobility, individual liberty and going to bed late \u2013- oh, and the rich, who are rather concentrated among us. So, philosophically, guilty as charged. \nLet me float back down to earth for a moment, and say that there are items featured in our T magazines which are what would generally be agreed upon to be affordable, and that T could stand a few more items like these in each issue (there are now more than a dozen T's coming at you each year) to be sure. But my guess is the $1,000 suitcase (or the $3,500 dress, or the $20,000 watch) would still get most of your, or anyone else\u2019s, attention. Some of the attention would be from eager purchasers \u2013- though that\u2019s not you, or me. Some of the readers might be, as you perceptively note, aspirational -\u2013 they might dream of buying said pricey item, but will eventually buy something less expensive that might be inspired by, or appear fashionably similar to, the high-priced item. But to tell you the truth that\u2019s not me either. At the risk of causing aneurysms among the magazine\u2019s ad staff, I don\u2019t shop from T or any other style magazine. \nTo explain why I do love T, and why I was eager to launch it here \u2013- maybe sometime in the future Stefano Tonchi, the editor of T, will answer readers' questions and give you his take -- I am going to float back up into the high ether again, and bring in one of my heroes (I don\u2019t have many), the Czech playwright, dissident and eventual president Vaclav Havel. Among his voluminous writings is an essay I remember in which he defends the preservation of a number of villas in Prague, villas denounced by the Communists as the old palaces of the grand bourgeoisie. (Raze them for workers\u2019 housing!) Havel writes warmly of the villas, and counsels his fellow citizens -\u2013 whom Communism delivered into block after block of drab, Soviet-style housing \u2013 to try to understand that much of the best of the West\u2019s cultural legacy was produced by the wealthy and, at least originally, for the wealthy, and that should in no way undermine the truth that these objects or things are interesting and beautiful \u2013 interesting and beautiful, potentially, for everyone, even those who don\u2019t own them. \nI think T is interesting and beautiful, potentially, for everyone \u2013 even those who will never own a suitcase that cost a thousand bucks. I think fashion, like wine (which I do shop for, alas, from magazines, or, anyway, newsletters), is something you can learn more about and thus appreciate more, even if you feel a little silly saying so. (I sat next to the Times\u2019 superb fashion critic, Cathy Horyn, at a few runway shows in Paris last fall, and began to learn how to really look, for the first time, at cuts and folds and so on.) I think style, more broadly, is being democraticized in America, reaching more kinds of stuff (why did my son want an ipod and not some other mp3 player?) and across all class lines (re: Target). I think this represents an important change, and I think T is the magazine of that change.\nThe Magazine-Newspaper Overlap\nQ. Sir -- My question is this: sometimes I find that the Times magazine publishes stories which have been extensively covered in the daily newspaper. Obviously, the magazine goes into much further detail and, in some cases, reveals new information. How do you go about arranging things so that your coverage doesn't overlap -- or scoop -- the daily newspaper?  \n-- Arnold Morton, New York\nA. Mr. Morton -- Your question about a magazine story overlapping with stories in one or another of the paper\u2019s sections is one I wrestle with only... well, all the time. As it happens, I've just returned to my desk from a weekly meeting of the editors of the various \"feature\" sections of the paper \u2013 Dining In/Dining Out, House & Home, the Book Review, etc., along with the magazine, or magazines now -- at which we were discussing the fifth anniversary of 9/11. And yes, coverage-wise, as this meeting turned up, there will inevitably be some overlap in coverage. But it\u2019s a problem, we all think, for which any strong cure for which would be worse \u2013 i.e., ANOTHER layer of list-making, beat-policing edit-crats stifling the natural urge of journalists to chase down the stories that get them excited. \nSo, when we at the magazine are to embark on a story, we let our appropriate colleagues around the paper know what we are up to, and if someone is doing precisely, or close to precisely, that for some or another section, we back off \u2013 and vice versa, sort of. Thus, you will not read in The Times this summer two profiles of Gnarls Barkley (and if you have to ask who, or what, Gnarls Barkley is... okay, maybe you won\u2019t read one \u2013 but if you want to read one, a smart and delightful one by Chuck Klosterman, we ran it in our June 18 issue). \nOr, as the Times is now a multi-platform news-and-information source, we might take a story we are about to publish and figure out ways to spin in out in other platforms of the paper (and non-paper). This is what we did a couple of weeks ago with a story we had on the cycler Floyd Landis. We had the scoop that his hip was in bad shape and that he would seek a replacement once he completed the Tour de France (and man did he complete it!). We closed the story on Friday, July 7, for our issue of Sunday, July 16. (The lag time is due to printing and shipping.) In order to get the scoop out there quickly, we posted our story on the Web site on the afternoon of Sunday, July 9, having tipped off our sports section, so it could be ready with a story for the print paper Monday morning. Overlap, yes, but also a Times scoop, a digital read, and a full magazine piece in print \u2013 take your choice. \nBut on those big, ongoing stories \u2013 Iraq, for example, or, just now, the roiling Mideast \u2013 we at the magazine are going to find our way of approaching the front-page news. That tends to mean extensive photography, in-depth opinion essays and long-form non-fiction narratives \u2013 forms that are read and viewed less for scoops or coverage than for sustained engagement and emotional engrossment. In a word, pleasure. The particular pleasure \u2013 literary, visual, even tactile \u2013 that a magazine can bring. Or so I hope. ",

Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200.\nBroadway\n'BUTLEY' In this uneasy revival of Simon Gray's portrait of a toxic English professor, directed by Nicholas Martin, Nathan Lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with \"Made in Britain\" engraved on them. A less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it(2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS: THE MUSICAL' The beloved holiday classic in a new musical version that honors the spirit and the letter of the original. (The two immortal Albert Hague-Dr. Seuss songs from the television special are included). Bloated at 90 minutes, but the kids didn't seem to mind (1:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called \"Little\" Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary-Louise Wilson (as her bed-ridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make \"Grey Gardens\" an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'HEARTBREAK HOUSE' A ripping revival of Shaw's comedy about the English gentry waltzing toward the abyss as the shadow of World War I looms. Philip Bosco, as the admirably sane madman Captain Shotover, and Swoosie Kurtz, as his swaggeringly romantic daughter, lead the superb cast, under the sharp direction of Robin Lefevre. Nearly a century after its composition, the play still sparkles with wit and sends a shiver down the spine too (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood) 'JAY JOHNSON: THE TWO AND ONLY' A genial entertainment giving Broadway audiences a chance to get reacquainted with the (almost) lost art of ventriloquism. Jay Johnson, the onetime star of the television comedy \"Soap,\" gives a pocket history of the profession, in addition to a demonstration, with partners including a vulture who sings \"My Way,\" a foul-mouthed wooden tyke, a talking tennis ball and a monkey purveying some of the corniest shtick this side of a Friar's roast (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'LES MIS\u00c9RABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood-style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LOSING LOUIE' This second-rate English import depicts the impact of an adulterous liaison on two generations of a family in Pound Ridge. Directed by Jerry Zaks, it's a queasy mixture of coarse comedy and soap opera contrivances (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of \"Hairspray\" fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called \"That 80's Show,\" this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, , are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\nOff Broadway\n'ALL THE WAY HOME' The play won a Pulitzer Prize, but in this revival by the Transport Group it is Sandra Goldmark's simple, striking set that first gets your attention, and then keeps refocusing it during a show that runs almost three hours. Amid her doll-size houses, the human actors seem like giants, but as the play progresses, it becomes apparent that the characters they play are anything but. The acting is excellent, though the play, centered on a small domestic tragedy, doesn't have the punch it once did (1:35). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Neil Genzlinger) 'ALL TOO HUMAN' Henry Miller's one-man show about Clarence Darrow is far from scintillating theater, but it's relevant. (1:35) 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates) 'THE AMERICAN PILOT' The fate of an injured American soldier hangs in the balance when his plane crashes in territory held by rebels fighting a regime backed by the United States. David Greig's play strives for the topical and the universal, but mostly gets hold of the generic (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club's City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) 'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing, offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Genzlinger) 'BHUTAN' Daisy Foote's drama may not be working the freshest territory -- dead-end lives in a small town -- but it sure is well told and well acted. A widow and her two teenagers are struggling financially and feeling dislocated by their town's changing social alignments; Sarah Lord is especially good as the daughter whose fascination with a neighbor's trip to Bhutan gives the play its title and overarching metaphor (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger) *'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'DAI (ENOUGH)' Iris Bahr's unnerving one-woman show doesn't have much to add to the Middle East debate, but it sure leaves a lasting impression. Ms. Bahr plays an assortment of characters who have the misfortune of being in a Tel Aviv cafe that is about to be visited by the havoc common to such establishments. The attack is rendered in jarring fashion, repeatedly; you watch the play on pins and needles, waiting for the next burst. Gimmicky? Sure. But viscerally effective. Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Genzlinger) 'DURANGO' In Julia Cho's tender-hearted comedy-drama, a Korean-American family takes to the road with a trunk full of emotional baggage in tow. The narrative mostly runs in familiar grooves, but Ms. Cho has a clear, honest voice, and Chay Yew's production sets it off elegantly (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Isherwood) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, \"everything old is old again\" (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'GREAT EXPECTATIONS' It's hard to improve on Dickens, and the playwright Bathsheba Doran doesn't manage to in the Theatreworks/USA production of her version for families and children. Directed by Will Pomerantz, scenes fly by too fast, and Kathleen Chalfant's Miss Havisham should be frightening rather than eccentric. But as her icy prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, Estella, Kristen Bush is near perfect (1:20). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Andrea Stevens) 'HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD AND FIND TRUE LOVE IN 90 MINUTES' This refreshing musical, born of the Fringe Festival, about a bookstore clerk, a slacker, a diplomat and a terrorist has witty songs, wacky performances and an untethered sense of fun (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates) 'THE MILLINER' Suzanne Glass's delicate play tells of a Jewish hat-maker who, after fleeing Germany and his beloved mother and business just before World War II, longs to return to Berlin. A vixenish cabaret singer is among the things beckoning him back. The lovely hats, both worn and used as scenery, will make the bare heads of 2006 long for the old days (2:30). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) 'MIMI LE DUCK' This musical, seen in 2004 at the New York International Fringe Festival, has morphed into a campy celebration of Eartha Kitt, who, just short of her 80th birthday, milks a minor role gleefully. The main order of business, though, is a middle-aged, middle-American housewife (Annie Golden), who, at the urging of Hemingway's ghost, goes to Paris in search of her true self. Diana Hansen-Young, who wrote the book and lyrics, seems to get most of her not-very-revolutionary ideas from mainstream women's magazines (2:05). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. o.e. (Gates) 'AN OAK TREE' Tim Crouch plays a hypnotist in this elusive puzzle of a play about grief and the power of suggestion (1:05). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) 'POST MORTEM' A grievance list of a comedy by the indefatigable A. R. Gurney, set in the near future, about the unearthing of a world-shaking play called \"Post Mortem\" by A. R. Gurney. Jim Simpson directs this likable grab bag of insider jokes, polemical satire and cosmic lamentation (1:30). The Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) 'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quip-meisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'ROMANIA. KISS ME!' A worthwhile collection of six short plays by young Romanian playwrights who grew up after the fall of Ceausescu's regime (2:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman) 'SCHOOL FOR WIVES' The Pearl Theater Company's production of Moli\u00e8re's satire about one misguided man's expectations of women is pleasant, occasionally quite funny and definitely on the side of common sense (1:55). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Gates) * 'STRIKING 12' A minimalist musical about an odd but rewarding New Year's Eve in the life of a guy who hates New Year's Eve. Performed by the indie pop band Groovelily, it's fresh and funny, and features a standout pop score (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER' As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)\nOff Off Broadway\n'JOB'S PASSION' The Israeli playwright Hanoch Levin's blending of two biblical characters, Job and Jesus, sometimes flaunts irreverence for irreverence's sake but finds both dizzying humor and rich meaning in human misery (2:00). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 254-1109. (Gates) 'WOYZECK' This improbably vivacious London-born production of Buchner's great, prophetic drama of existential emptiness finds the bleak rhythm of life in, of all things, the music of Elvis Presley. While Daniel Kramer's production is more flash than feeling, it features a first-rate, gymnastically stylized performance from Edward Hogg in the title role (2:20). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779. (Brantley)\nLong-Running Shows\n'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Gates) * 'THE HAIRY APE' The Irish Repertory Theater has put together a startling production of Eugene O'Neill's tale of a galoot called Yank who goes looking for his place in the world, one that vividly conveys what a gut-punch this work must have been when it was first seen in 1922. Eugene Lee's set is something to see, and the soundscape, by Zachary Williamson and Gabe Wood, is something to hear (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'HOME FRONT' Fletcher McTaggert gives a gut-wrenching performance in Daniel Algie's updated Greek tragedy about the family of a soldier missing in action in Vietnam (1:30).

(Gates) 'THE INTERNATIONALIST' Anne Washburn's quirky comedy follows in the woozy footsteps of an American businessman abroad as he tries to transact business personal and professional through a sturdy language barrier. Ms. Washburn's oblique style is initially intriguing, ultimately wearisome. (2:00). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'LIVE GIRLS' Victoria Stewart's drama sends up the docudrama and an Anna Deavere Smith-like performance artist (1:30). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) 'MY DEAH' \"The mind of a beauty queen is a thing to fear!\" John Epperson, a k a Lypsinka, brings his love of cultural deconstruction and reconstruction to this lovably trashy spoof of a certain exalted Greek tragedy, in which a scorned woman sets about chicken-frying her own children to get even with the no-account man who done her wrong. Nancy Opel and Maxwell Caulfield lead the cast in offering big servings of honey-baked ham (1:30). Abingdon Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'SPEEDMOUSE' Two guys from Australia working in remarkable synchrony create wildly funny slapstick out of sound effects and mime (1:20).

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.\n* 'THE AURA' (No rating, 138 minutes, in Spanish) A heist, a case of mistaken identity and a lonely, epileptic taxidermist are at the heart of this melancholy, deeply satisfying noir exercise, the second and last feature directed by the Argentine filmmaker Fabi\u00e1n Bielinsky, who died in June. (A. O. Scott) 'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (Scott) 'BACKSTAGE' (No rating, 112 minutes, in French) Beautifully acted and uncomfortably believable much of the time, this close-up study of the toxic relationship of a narcissistic French pop star and a besotted teenage fan produces a feeling of emotional claustrophobia. (Stephen Holden) 'BOBBY' (R, 111 minutes) Emilio Estevez's picture, which follows a score of characters through the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, is full of noble ambition. The day in question ended with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, an event that hovers over the movie, even though Kennedy himself is visible only in archival clips. A huge cast (including Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Lindsay Lohan and Mr. Estevez) labors to inject a collection of melodramatic anecdotes with portent and significance, but the individual parts of the film tend to be either overdone or vague and slight. (Scott) * 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN,' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Manohla Dargis) 'CASINO ROYALE' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The latest James Bond vehicle finds the British spy leaner, meaner and now played by an attractive piece of blond rough named Daniel Craig. Zap, pow, ka-ching! (Dargis) 'COME EARLY MORNING' (R, 97 minutes) Ashley Judd returns to the Southern, working-class milieu of her first screen triumph, \"Ruby in Paradise,\" to deliver her most natural screen performance since that film pushed her toward stardom in 1993. Aside from pungent local color, there's not much surrounding this portrait of an embittered barfly floundering through a succession of one-night stands. (Holden) 'DANCE PARTY, USA' (No rating, 66 minutes) During a Fourth of July weekend in Portland, Oregon, a pair of disaffected 17-year-olds are nudged toward adulthood in a movie that favors natural drift over artificial drama. When Gus (Cole Pensinger) meets the more mature Jessica (Anna Kavan), his journey from crass lady-killer to sensitive boyfriend begins. Directed with extraordinary empathy by Aaron Katz (who also wrote the story), this admittedly slight movie is given heft by a plaintive tone and a camera fascinated by emotional shifts and shadows. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'DECK THE HALLS' (PG, 95 minutes) In the holiday tradition of stale fruitcake, ugly snowflake sweaters and food poisoning comes this piece of junk, in which Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito compete to see who can annoy the audience more. (Scott) 'D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU' (PG-13, 125 minutes) In Tony Scott's preposterous action flick, with Denzel Washington, the gaudy pyrotechnics are nowhere near as jaw-dropping as the screenplay that name-checks not one, not two, but three national tragedies. ( Dargis) 'ENCOUNTER POINT' (No rating, 85 minutes, in Arabic, Hebrew and English) Ronit Avni's documentary about Israelis and Palestinians working toward reconciliation is assured, thoughtful, clear-eyed and even hopeful. (Anita Gates) * 'FAST FOOD NATION' (R, 106 minutes) Richard Linklater has turned Eric Schlosser's journalistic expos\u00e9 of the American industrial food system into a thoughtful, occasionally rambling inquiry into the contradictions of contemporary American life. Three stories, all taking place mainly in the fictional town of Cody, Colo., examine different parts of the capitalist food chain: illegal immigrants from Mexico work in terrible conditions in a meat-processing plant; a restaurant chain executive undergoes a crisis of conscience; and a teenage burger-slinger is drawn into political activism. Mr. Linklater covers a lot of ground, and the result is an unusually funny, moving and intellectually demanding movie. (Scott) * 'FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' (R, 132 minutes) Clint Eastwood raises the flag over Iwo Jima once more in a powerful if imperfect film about the uses of war and of the men who fight. The fine cast includes Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach, who delivers heartbreak by the payload. (Dargis) 'FLANNEL PAJAMAS' (No rating, 124 minutes) The twin specters of Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen hover over this unassumingly named film, which might have been more accurately titled \"Scenes From a Mixed Marriage\" or \"Annie Hall Without Laughs.\" This smart, talky history of a relationship between two New Yorkers follows a Jewish theatrical promoter and an aspiring caterer from a Roman Catholic background from courtship to marriage to separation. (Holden) * 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (\"Wallace and Gromit,\" \"Chicken Run\") is completely delightful. (Scott) 'THE FOUNTAIN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Darren Aronovsky's new film spans a thousand years, as Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman pursue undying love and eternal life in the 16th, 21st and 26th centuries. There is some lovely visual poetry, but the ideas are pure doggerel, an ungainly mixture of sci-fi overreach and earnest sentimentality. (Scott) 'FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION' (PG-13, 86 minutes) This satire of pre-Oscar nomination buzz in Hollywood is far and away the broadest comedy Christopher Guest and his improvisatory company have made. Despite its abundant merriment, it is also the flimsiest, and unlike Mr. Guest's earlier films, it has no airs of being a fake documentary. As farce trumps satire, the humor's subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, except for the brilliant exception of Catherine O'Hara. (Holden) 'FUR: AN IMAGINARY PORTRAIT OF DIANE ARBUS' (R, 122 minutes) Nicole Kidman stars as the famous photographer, and Robert Downey Jr. plays her imaginary furry friend. Steven Shainberg directs from a screenplay by Erin Cressida Wilson. (Dargis) 'A GOOD YEAR' (PG-13, 117 minutes) This sun-dappled romantic diversion is a major departure for its director, Ridley Scott, and for its star, Russell Crowe. Mr. Crowe is miscast as a ferocious London bond trader who mellows after inheriting a French vineyard. It's a three-P movie, for pleasant, pretty and predictable. Add a fourth P, for piddling. (Holden) 'HAPPY FEET' (PG, 100 minutes) The director George Miller gets happy and snappy, then goes dark and deep, in a musical about an animated penguin who was born to dance. Take hankies. (Dargis) 'HARSH TIMES' (R, 119 minutes) Christian Bale turns in a spectacular technical performance as a war veteran running amok on the streets of South Central Los Angeles and dragging along his best friend (Freddy Rodriguez) on the road to hell. The losers in the directorial debut of David Ayer (who wrote \"Training Day\") are too repellent for you to waste time feeling sorry for. (Holden) 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (R, 104 minutes) The current of intellectual energy snapping through this ferociously engaging screen adaptation of Alan Bennett's Tony Award-winning play, set in a north England boys' school in 1983, feels like electrical brain stimulation. As two teachers jockey for the hearts and minds of eight teenage schoolboys preparing to apply to Oxford and Cambridge, their epigrams send up small jolts of pleasure and excitement. How to teach and interpret history is the question. (Holden) 'LET'S GO TO PRISON' (R, 84 minutes) Sure, it has shower scenes, but they're sly and restrained rather than frat house obvious, and all the funnier for it. Dax Shepard is hilariously deadpan as a petty criminal who retaliates against a judge by contriving for the man's son (Will Arnett) to be arrested and then purposely being arrested himself so he can harass the prissy fellow. Chi McBride is perfect as a fellow inmate with a taste for prison lovin' and a voice like Barry White's. (Neil Genzlinger) 'THE SANTA CLAUSE 3: THE ESCAPE CLAUSE' (G, 98 minutes) Ho, ho, ho? No, no, no. (Dargis) * 'SHUT UP & SING' (R, 93 minutes) Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck's revealing documentary follows the Dixie Chicks around for three years as the group deals with the consequences of a remark by its lead singer, Natalie Maines, who said from a London stage that they were ashamed that the president of the United States was from Texas. The movie is a fascinating study of the relationship between the media, politics and the music industry in an era in which pop musicians are marketed like politicians. (Holden) 'TENACIOUS D IN THE PICK OF DESTINY' (R, 87 minutes) As it wobbles from one episode to the next, the rock 'n' roll comedy starring Jack Black is a garish mess, and some of it feels padded. But it has enough jokes to keep you smiling, and Mr. Black brings to it a fervent affection for the music he spoofs but obviously adores. (Holden) * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Alm\u00f3dovar, with Pen\u00e9lope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott) 'WHO THE $#%& IS JACKSON POLLOCK?' (PG-13, 74 minutes) This entertaining documentary follows the decade-long campaign of Teri Horton, a former truck driver, to prove that an unsigned painting she purchased at a thrift shop for $5 is an authentic Jackson Pollock that could be worth $50 million. Self-serving experts are lined on both sides. (Holden) * 'THE WILD BLUE YONDER' (No rating, 81 minutes) An artful mixture of carefully culled and originally produced material, Werner Herzog's self-described \"science fiction fantasy\" purports to tell the story of an alien species beset by misfortune. Brad Dourif stars alongside some floating astronauts and a few exquisitely beautiful underwater drifters.

(Jon Pareles) * THE BRAVERY, RADIO 4 (Wednesday) Disco first met punk in Britain in the late '70s, but they have had quite a romance in turn-of-the-21st-century New York. The Bravery emerged about two years ago with a battery of catchy, radio-ready songs and buckets of hair gel; the band has been compared, accurately, to the Strokes, Interpol, New Order, U2 and Franz Ferdinand. Radio 4 was among the first local bands to mine the sound of postpunk British groups like the Gang of Four, which it does studiously but not very imaginatively.

(Tuesday) At first glance this young band from Leeds, England, seems awfully severe: sharp, angular artwork modeled on the early Soviet avant-garde, and songs named by number (\"Twelve\" was its first hit). Its lyrics aren't exactly Beach Boys material, either (\"it's another obsidian bloodbath\"). But the jabby guitars and jerky disco-punk beat, derived from groups like Franz Ferdinand and Bloc Party, are really nothing but good old rock 'n' roll fun. With Snowden and Meneguar.

(\"Just one thing I can't compromise/I want to see you work it guy-on-guy.\") With Quintron and Miss Pussycat. At 9, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $25. (Sisario) LUCIA PULIDO (Tonight) Ms. Pulido, from Colombia, merges traditional Colombian songs with modern jazz. As Susana Baca has done with Afro-Peruvian songs, Ms. Pulido holds on to the rawness of the original melodies while giving them a sophisticated new context. At 9:30, Barb\u00e8s, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; $10. (Pareles) REDMAN, RAEKWON, KEITH MURRAY (Tuesday) The new old school.

(Sisario) SAM ROBERTS BAND, JASON COLLETT (Monday) Sam Roberts, from Montreal, plays big-chord, big-heart rock anthems in the tradition of the Who, with an earnestness that is as much asset as liability (\"my love for you is as deep as a coal mine\"). Mr. Collett, a sometime member of the Toronto indie collective Broken Social Scene, draws inspiration from Bob Dylan and the Allman Brothers, among others. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario) THE SOUNDS (Tonight) Sweden has a strong heritage of dedicated rockers playing lean, tough music. It's also one of the capitals of bubblegum pop, and those two worlds meet, somewhat jarringly, in the Sounds, who about 80 percent of the time sound like graduates of the Academy of Joan Jett, and the rest of the time play a kind of dance-pop (\"Tony the Beat\") clean enough for the prom. With Shiny Toy Guns. At 6, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20. (Sisario) * TEXAS IS THE REASON (Tomorrow and Sunday) Emo is now old enough to have reunion concerts. Texas Is the Reason, which might be called proto-emo, was formed in New York by two Hare Krishnas in 1994 and dissolved three years later; in between it played an influential kind of therapeutic hardcore punk made of big, chunky guitars and unabashedly vulnerable vocals. The band has gotten back together for what it says are only two shows, which are, of course, sold out. With Ian Love and Jon Sass. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com. (Sisario) STEVE TYRELL (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Tyrell belongs to a latter-day breed of rock singer who has belatedly embraced popular standards. The breed includes Rod Stewart (whose records Mr. Tyrell co-produces), Michael Bolton and Dr. John (for whom he sometimes sounds like a vocal double). At 8:45, with additional shows tonight, tomorrow and Thursday night at 10:45, Caf\u00e9 Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $90 cover, dinner required. (Stephen Holden) FRANKIE VALLI (Tonight through Sunday) Newly re-enshrined by \"Jersey Boys,\" a success on Broadway even as most other shows based on pop stars have failed -- does anyone remember \"Lennon\"? -- Mr. Valli sings at the Rose Theater, home of Jazz at Lincoln Center, joined as always by his Four Seasons. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday night at 7, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $75 to $125. (Sisario) JERRY JEFF WALKER (Tonight and tomorrow night) Jerry Jeff Walker wrote the hit \"Mr. Bojangles,\" but around his home-stomping grounds of Texas, he's the easygoing, gruffly avuncular icon of the cosmic cowboy mentality, all about spacing out in the wide-open spaces. At 8, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $35 in advance, $40 at the door. (Pareles) * ZS, DIRTY PROJECTORS (Tonight) A meeting of two of the strongest avant-garde bands in New York. The Zs' songs sputter forth in Morse code dots of percussion and saxophone, and Dirty Projectors, led by Dave Longstreth, build elaborate \"glitch operas\" with stark pluckings of guitar and strings, precise harmonies and Mr. Longstreth's warbling, ecstatic tenor, all arranged slightly out of whack. At 8, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; $10. Dirty Projectors also play tomorrow at 8 p.m., with Ecstatic Sunshine and Beautiful Weekend, at the Syrup Room, 100 Ingraham Street, at Porter Avenue, East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, toddpnyc.com; $10. The Zs play on Thursday at 9 p.m., with Time of Orchids and Blind Idiot God, at Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $10. (Sisario)\nJazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.\nREZ ABBASI AND SNAKE CHARMER (Tuesday) On his new album, \"Bazaar\" (Zoho), the guitarist Rez Abbasi infuses Southeast Asian motifs with jazz flexibility, rock bombast and the swirl of a Hammond B-3 organ.

At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Nate Chinen) DARCY JAMES ARGUE'S SECRET SOCIETY (Thursday) As the name implies, this big band is calibrated for maximum intrigue, with a style that genuflects to Steve Reich minimalism as well as to orchestral jazz in the descent of Bob Brookmeyer. At 10 p.m., Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, between Houston and Bleecker Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 614-0505, bowerypoetry.com; cover, $12. (Chinen) GARY BARTZ/MULGREW MILLER (Monday) Mr. Bartz is an alto saxophonist with a searching approach, and Mr. Miller is a pianist with an earthy style. Post-Coltrane modality will most likely play a part in their duets, along with some well-conceived original tunes. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $25 at tables, $15 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen) GENE BERTONCINI (Wednesday) \"Quiet Now,\" a solo guitar album issued by Ambient Records last year, was a perfect showcase for Mr. Bertoncini's tasteful virtuosity. He is performing not only in that unaccompanied setting but also in a trio (Ike Sturm on bass, Mark Ferber on drums), basing his repertory on standards of the Brazilian and classical canons as well as on American song. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $20.

(Chinen) CURTIS FULLER QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Though not among the first wave of bebop revolutionaries at Minton's Playhouse, the trombonist Curtis Fuller made his sterling reputation shortly thereafter, during the heyday of hard bop. He holds court at the refurbished Minton's this weekend, with a rhythm section. At 10 and 11:30, and 1 a.m., Minton's Playhouse, 208 West 118th Street, Harlem, (212) 864-8346; cover, $10, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen) DAVID GILMORE (Tomorrow) Mr. Gilmore recently issued an album called \"Unified Presence\" (RKM) that showcases both his dazzlingly fluid guitar playing and his rhythmically convoluted compositions. Here he strips his group down to a core of Brad Jones on bass and Rudy Royston on drums. At midnight, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $10, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) * DIZZY GILLESPIE ALL-STAR BIG BAND/NEW ORLEANS JAZZ ORCHESTRA (Tomorrow) The clarinetist and saxophonist Paquito D'Rivera, the trumpeter Roy Hargrove and the pianist Cyrus Chestnut are a few of the high-wattage players in the Dizzy Gillespie All-Star Big Band. But the chief attraction of this concert is the premiere of \"Rising Tide,\" a topical commission by the trumpeter Irvin Mayfield, for his New Orleans Jazz Orchestra. At 8 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, www.njpac.org; $35 to $58. (Chinen) TOM HARRELL QUINTET (Tuesday through Thursday) An introverted but assertive trumpeter, Tom Harrell leads a hard-swinging post-bop band with Wayne Escoffery on tenor saxophone, Danny Grissett on piano, Ugonna Okegwo on bass and Johnathan Blake on drums.

(Chinen) JOE LOVANO NONET (Tonight through Sunday night) Joe Lovano, a tenor saxophonist with much experience in large ensembles, has intermittently led an excellent bop-flavored nonet for a number of years. This week the group has been playing a Miles Davis-centric repertory drawn from Mr. Lovano's recent Blue Note album, \"Streams of Expression.\" At 9 and 11, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) * RUDRESH MAHANTHAPPA QUARTET (Thursday) \"Codebook\" (Pi), the latest album by the alto saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa, investigates the topic of cryptography, not necessarily the most promising theme for an improviser. What lifts the project off the ground is the brazen imaginative exertion of his band, which is appearing with one substitution: Craig Taborn, who ably fills in on piano for Vijay Iyer. At 8 and 10 p.m., Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626, sweetrhythmny.com; cover, $15, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) * MANHATTAN TRINITY (Tuesday through Thursday) This group deserves the high-minded handle; its members are the soulful pianist Cyrus Chestnut, the erudite bassist George Mraz and the impeccable drummer Lewis Nash. (Through Dec. 3.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org: cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen) PAT MARTINO (Wednesday and Thursday) On \"Remember,\" his latest Blue Note album, Mr. Martino pays homage to one of his guitar heroes, Wes Montgomery. That the gesture pays off is a testament to the untroubled self-assurance of his emulation, and the simple satisfaction of a hard-swinging band. (Through Dec. 2.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) MEDESKI MARTIN SCOFIELD & WOOD (Tonight and tomorrow night) Eight years ago the guitarist John Scofield began his jam-band crossover career with \"A Go Go\" (Verve), an album that cast Medeski Martin & Wood in an accompanying role. Now Mr. Scofield is touring as an equal partner with the groove trio in support of \"Out Louder\" (Indirecto), an altogether superior new release. At 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $35. (Chinen) AARON PARKS (Monday) Mr. Parks, who has turned heads for the past few years as the young pianist in Terence Blanchard's band, was a finalist in this year's Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition. Here, as part of a \"Monk in Motion\" concert series, he leads a quartet with Mike Moreno on guitar, Derrick Hodge on bass and Kendrick Scott on drums.

(Chinen) HOUSTON PERSON QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Person's latest album, \"You Taught My Heart to Sing\" (Half Note), features his tenor saxophone and Bill Charlap's piano in a program of tender duets. Here, without Mr. Charlap, he returns to form, applying his robust tone to a more rhythmically assertive purpose. At 8:30, 10 and 11:30, Lenox Lounge, 288 Lenox Avenue, at 124th Street, Harlem, (212) 427-0253, lenoxlounge.com; cover, $25, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) RASHANIM/TALAT (Thursday) The guitarist Jon Madof, the bassist Shanir Ezra Blumenkranz and the percussionist Mathias K\u00fcnzli are Rashanim, a rambunctious trio with a new album, \"Shalosh\" (Tzadik), that supports John Zorn's banner ideal of radical Jewish music. Talat, also celebrating a new album, is a comparably less established ensemble with a promising lineup, including the trumpeter Matt Shulman and the saxophonist Marc Mommaas. At 9 p.m., Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, near Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-6934, zebuloncafeconcert.com; no cover. (Chinen) WALLACE RONEY (Tomorrow) On his recent album \"Mystikal\" (High Note), Mr. Roney advances a species of Afro-futurism inherited and adapted from his trumpet mentor Miles Davis. He explores similar territory in a hard-hitting ensemble with his brother, Antoine Roney, on tenor and soprano saxophone; Robert Irving on piano; Clarence Seay on bass; Val Jeanty on turntables; and Eric Allen on drums. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $20, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen) PHAROAH SANDERS (Thursday) Mr. Sanders, an authoritative ambassador of the 1960s avant-garde, has never stopped imbuing his performances with the tone of a spiritual quest; he has worthy acolytes in the pianist William Henderson, the bassist Nat Reeves and the drummer Joe Farnsworth. (Through Dec. 3.) At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $35, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) * MARIA SCHNEIDER JAZZ ORCHESTRA (Tonight through Sunday night) Evocative harmonic coloration and swirling rhythmic undercurrent are two of the chief devices of this large ensemble, led by the composer Maria Schneider. Its ranks include improvisers like the tenor saxophonist Rich Perry and the pianist Frank Kimbrough, but its strength lies in a virtually unsurpassed degree of cohesion. At 7:30 and 9:30, with an additional 11:30 show tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $30. (Chinen) TANGO MEETS JAZZ FESTIVAL (Thursday) The overlap between American jazz and Argentinean tango provides a premise for this quartet engagement featuring the pianist Pablo Ziegler, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the peerless tango composer Astor Piazzolla.

(Chinen) * HENRY THREADGILL'S ZOOID (Tonight through Sunday night) The august composer and multi-reedist Henry Threadgill has always nursed a fascination with timbre. These days he indulges it best in this superb ensemble, which finds his flute and alto saxophone in conversation with Liberty Ellman's acoustic guitar, Jose Davila's tuba and trombone, Dana Leong and Rubin Kodheli's cellos, and Elliot Humberto Kavee's drums. At 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $20; members, $10.

(Chinen)\nClassical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.\nOpera\n* 'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Tonight and Monday) Bartlett Sher's breezy new production of Rossini's \"Barbiere di Siviglia\" conveys the comic confusions of the story through its fluid staging and a wonderfully abstract set: a matrix of movable doors, staircases and potted orange trees, behind which characters spy on one another. The heated sexuality of the characters also comes through strongly, thanks to Mr. Sher's subtle directing of a handsome cast. Peter Mattei is a robust and agile Figaro. Diana Damrau is a vocally brilliant and feisty Rosina. Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez could not be more adorable as the amorous Count Almaviva, though his voice sounds pinched and shaky at times. Maurizio Benini conducts a fleet and stylish performance. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini) 'LA BOH\u00c8ME' (Tomorrow) Franco Zeffirelli's overblown \"Boh\u00e8me\" returns to the Met for its regular airing. Rolando Villaz\u00f3n, the talented Mexican tenor, is a convincing Rodolfo, although his voice and charisma are somewhat dwarfed by the massive sets. Mr. Villaz\u00f3n's mentor and idol, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, leads the orchestra in a fine, lively performance. Angela Marambio, the Chilean soprano, makes her house debut as a warm-voiced, robust Mimi. Cynthia Lawrence replaces Susannah Glanville as Musetta, and Peter Coleman-Wright is her jealous lover, Marcello. At 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $220 and $320 tickets remain. (Vivien Schweitzer) * 'DON CARLO' (Thursday) James Levine will be in the pit when Verdi's noble masterpiece returns to the Met in John Dexter's production. This is a work Mr. Levine reveres and has conducted magnificently over the years. The Met has assembled what looks to be a top-tier cast, with the powerhouse tenor Johan Botha singing the title role for the first time with the company; Patricia Racette as Elisabeth; Dmitri Hvorostovsky as Rodrigo; Ren\u00e9 Pape as Philip II; Olga Borodina as Eboli; and Samuel Ramey as the Grand Inquisitor. At 7 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $175. (Tommasini) 'IDOMENEO' (Wednesday) In place of the dramatic tenor Ben Heppner, the clarion-voiced tenor Kobie van Rensburg, who made an impressive Met debut two years ago in Handel's \"Rodelinda,\" takes over the title role in Mozart's noble opera seria \"Idomeneo,\" which has returned to the company's roster in Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's highly stylized and effective 1982 production. There are two other cast changes: the elegant mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena sings Idamante, and the bright-voiced soprano Alexandra Deshorties sings the volatile Elettra. Best of all, Dorothea R\u00f6schmann, a superb soprano, returns as Ilia. James Levine conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $175. (Tommasini) 'RIGOLETTO' (Tonight through Sunday) Now in its 59th season, the Amato Opera continues to stage productions in its tiny quarters on the Bowery. This weekend it concludes its run of Verdi's \"Rigoletto.\" The quality often varies, but the spirit is usually there. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200, amato.org; $35; $28 for students and 65+. (Schweitzer) 'TOSCA' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) To many, she's the last of the Golden Age sopranos: Aprile Millo is taking over one of her signature roles for two performances this week at the Metropolitan Opera. Walter Fraccaro is her Cavaradossi; James Morris seems to have become the Met's perennial Scarpia. The conductor Nicola Luisotti should be a fine match for Ms. Millo: both approach this piece, which can seem merely a hoary war horse, as if it actually mattered. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $220 tomorrow, $15 to $175 on Tuesday. (Anne Midgette)\nClassical Music\nBARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) The programming edges toward contemporary chamber music at this floating concert hall this weekend, before moving on to the standard repertory on Thursday. Tonight at a \"cushion concert\" -- you lounge on cushions rather than on the usual folding chairs (although chairs will be available for older listeners who prefer them) -- a piano trio plays works by Ives, Shostakovich, Chick Corea and Bright Sheng. The trio's pianist, Steven Beck, stays on tomorrow and Sunday to perform the Korngold Piano Quintet with the Manhattan String Quartet, on a program that also includes the Ives Quartet No. 1 and Smetana's \"In My Life.\" On Thursday the violinist Mark Peskanov, the flutist Massimo Mercelli and the violist Maurycy Banaszek play Mozart, Beethoven and C.

(Kozinn) CHRISTINA JENNINGS AND PETER KOLKAY (Thursday) A flute and bassoon recital may not sound like a wild event. But two adventurous young musicians, the flutist Christina Jennings and the bassoonist Peter Kolkay, both recent winners of Concert Artists Guild prizes, promise a wild survey of contemporary works. Their program, sponsored by the Guild, was inspired, they report, by James Brown, Andy Warhol and the electric-era Miles Davis. There will be works by David Lang, Paul Moravec and Toru Takemitsu, among others. At 7:30 p.m., Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $21.

(Holland) MIR\u00d3 QUARTET (Wednesday) Music by the 18-year-old Juan Cris\u00f3stomo Arriaga from 1824, two years before his death, joins more familiar repertory from Shostakovich and Dvorak. This string quartet is presented by the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. At 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; $30 to $52. (Holland) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Tuesday and Thursday) New York's premier orchestra is back from its successful tour of Japan and Korea. And for the homecoming, the music director Lorin Maazel is offering what looks to be a perfunctory program. The pianist Joyce Yang is the soloist in Rachmaninoff's \"Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini,\" heard last season in a dazzling account with the pianist Gabriela Montero. The program also includes Beethoven's \"Eroica\" Symphony. Hmmm. Didn't Mr. Maazel begin the season with this piece? Thursday's program is somewhat more interesting, with works by Mozart, Hindemith, Roussel and Strauss. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $28 to $96.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.\nMuseums\n* AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100. (Roberta Smith) * BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: 'TROPICALIA: A REVOLUTION IN BRAZILIAN CULTURE,' through Jan. 28. Tropicalia, or Tropicalism, wasn't a style or a movement as much as an atmosphere, a rush of youthful, cosmopolitan, liberating optimism that broke over Brazil in the late 1960s like a sun shower, and soaked into everything -- art, music, film, theater and architecture -- until a military government clamped down. This show is an attempt to recapture the moment's fugitive spirit, and with the presence of artists like Helio Oiticica and Lygia Clark, the architect Lina Bo Bardi, and musicians like Gilberto Gil, it comes close. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'ANNIE LEIBOVITZ: A PHOTOGRAPHER'S LIFE, 1990-2005,' through Jan. 21. With photographs of her close-knit family and her companion, Susan Sontag; bits of photojournalism; and a pretentious foray into landscape photography, this large exhibition tells you more about Ms. Leibovitz than you probably want to know. The first-person text labels don't help. Not surprisingly, her well-known celebrity portraits are strongest, and at their best in a re-creation of the large pin-up boards on which she plotted the lavish book that accompanies the show. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Smith) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'RON MUECK,' through Feb. 4. So intensely lifelike are the fiberglass and silicone human figures made by the Australian sculptor Ron Mueck that you might almost converse with them. Ranging in size from an infant that is 10 and a quarter inches high to a woman in bed more than 21 feet long, they seem to embody, in one way or another, the perils and challenges of the human condition. The most affecting are \"Dead Dad,\" a 40-inch rendering of the artist's father as a nude corpse, and \"Man in a Boat,\" in which a man a little more than two feet high sits naked and hapless toward the prow of a life-size rowboat. But Mr. Mueck stumbles when he gets into really exaggerated scale. The subject has not earned its monumentality, and its size distracts from its emotional intensity. Still, there are moments when you almost believe his subjects have lives. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) * FRICK COLLECTION: 'DOMENICO TIEPOLO (1727-1804): A NEW TESTAMENT,' through Jan. 7. The 60 ink drawings by Domenico Tiepolo, son of the Italian master painter Giambattist, have a funny kind of jitter. They look as if they were maybe woven from hair-fine brambles, or done on a ride over rough ground, or in a state of agitated elation. Illustrations of episodes from the four Gospels, they are among some 300 drawings the artist did in a project that seems to have been an extended exercise in personal piety. In them the Christian story of salvation becomes an operatic epic, gravely serious, but with notes of homely sweetness: Jesus in Gethsemane delivers his aria of mortal doubt and pain high up on a bare stage, all alone; the Virgin Mary's mother, Anna, aged and stooped, is cosseted by angel-nurses, who guide her every step. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter) * FRICK COLLECTION: 'MASTERPIECES OF EUROPEAN PAINTING FROM THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART,' through Jan. 28. This exhibition transcends the usual traveling masterpieces-from genre, with room to spare. The 14 paintings include almost always outstanding works by household names like Vel\u00e1zquez, Caravaggio, El Greco, Turner and Poussin, as well as Annibale Carracci, Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n and Andrea del Sarto. But the astute installation makes the most of all this star power, letting the works talk among themselves to a remarkable degree, illuminating their likenesses, differences and collective progress. Extending John Berger's famous title, the show might be called \"Ways of Seeing Paintings.\" (See above.) (Smith) * SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'LUCIO FONTANA: VENICE/NEW YORK,' through Jan. 21. If the Italian artist Lucio Fontana (1899-1968) was dazzled by Venice, he was positively awestruck by New York, which he first visited in 1961. For each city he created a group of works that he felt expressed its individual spirit. For Venice, a group of richly sensual oil paintings, with his signature slashes and punctures, evoked his personal experience of the lagoon city in glowing colors during the passage of a day. For New York he chose shiny metal surfaces, slashed and pierced to give a semblance of the wired energy and architectural vivacity he saw as the essence of the futuristic metropolis. The two groups are united for the first time, and well attended by works and photographs of works that trace from 1949 the career of an artist seeking to transcend the boundaries of his era. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Glueck) * SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'SPANISH PAINTING FROM EL GRECO TO PICASSO,' through March 28. This show is spectacularly grand and avoids the familiar piety of the standard masterpiece potpourri by virtue of its eloquent installation in the museum's loopy ramp, still the weirdest-coolest place to look at art and at other people looking at art. It's carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Vel\u00e1zquezes and Zurbar\u00e1ns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dal\u00eds and Picassos, many famous, many not. I can't tell you how often I was stopped by a picture so good or unexpected that it made me do a double take. The show's big point, which has the simple virtue of being self-evident, is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Vel\u00e1zquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'AMERICANS IN PARIS: 1860-1900,' through Jan. 28. The Americanization of the world may be a done deal now, but not so long ago the United States was a buyer rather than a seller of cultural information, and France was a major source between the Civil War and World War I. That's the story told in this exhibition. The basic ideas, though undeveloped, are inherently interesting, and the art, with some notable exceptions, is conservative and staid, especially when compared with work in the Met's Vollard show, done at the same time. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter) THE MET: 'COAXING THE SPIRITS TO DANCE,' through Sept. 3, 2007. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted \"spirit boards\" made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area's traditional artworks. Their central designs typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (See above.) (Glueck) MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'FRAGONARD AND THE FRENCH TRADITION' AND 'MOZART AT 250: A CELEBRATION,' through Jan. 7. Memorializing Mozart's 250th birthday and the 200th anniversary of the death of the French painter Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, these small, paired shows reflect the elegance and brio of 18th-century culture. The Fragonard display consists only of his drawings and those of some compatriots; 40 works in all, drawn almost entirely from the Morgan's collection. The show effectively displays the virtuosity and variety of Fragonard's many styles, from his skills at depicting foliage-filled landscapes and the play of water in fountains and streams, to his keenness at capturing people, mythological scenes and ephemeral creatures. Although the works in the Mozart display -- letters and musical scores -- are in quite a different visual language, they go very happily with the Fragonard group. And you can hear excerpts from the manuscripts at two different listening stations in the show. 255 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Glueck) * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MANET AND THE EXECUTION OF MAXIMILIAN,' through Jan. 29. This small, gripping, focused show remind us of Modernism's mutinous, myth-scouring origins. And it does so by bringing one of art's great path-cutters, Edouard Manet, onto the scene, wry, politically infuriated and painting like Lucifer. There's not a lot of him here: eight paintings, three on a single theme: the death by firing squad of the Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian in Mexico in 1867. But it's enough. Manet's images, surrounded here by a selection of prints and photographs, are electrifying, a new kind of history painting, that turned an art of pre-set ideals into one of mutable and unpredictable realities. (212) 708-9400. (Cotter) * MOMA: 'BRICE MARDEN: A RETROSPECTIVE OF PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS,' through Jan. 15. This quietly magnificent 40-year retrospective pays tribute to an artist who helped rebuild painting in the 1970s, working back from the brink of single-panel monochromes to elegant tangles of thick line on vibrant monochrome grounds that encompass a tremendous emotional range and sense of physical energy, and give the lie to the idea that any art can be purely formal or completely abstract. Mr. Marden converted the rule-ridden zone of Minimalist abstraction into a capacious yet disciplined place, pushing it toward landscape, the figure and its roots in Abstract Expressionism and beyond, in non-Western art. And he may have saved the best for last. (See above.) (Smith) * NEUE GALLERY: 'JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,' through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or \"total work of art,\" orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Many objects were executed by the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte, an artists' collaborative that insisted on the handmade component of good design, founded by him with the painter and designer Kolomon Moser. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. And there are photographs of many buildings he designed, including the Palais Stoclet in Brussels, an ultraluxurious home for a millionaire that he considered his best Gesamkunstwerk. Though focused on interiors, the show conveys the basic ideas of a designer immersed in a new vision. Neue Gallery, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)\nNEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'NEW YORK DIVIDED: SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR,' through Sept. 3. New York has a cosmopolitan pride in itself, but as this exhibition shows, it is not always well deserved. Even after slavery belatedly came to an end in New York State in 1827, New York City was a \"hotbed of pro-slavery politics,\" inspired by close commercial links with the South and the international cotton trade. For every instance of abolitionist activity, there is another in which slavery is defended or supported. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historic objects, shows how divided the city was, even during the years of the Civil War. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery's horrific heritage. The exhibition brings to a close the Historical Society's multi-year exploration of slavery in New York. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400.(Edward Rothstein) * UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'CROSSROADS: MODERNISM IN UKRAINE, 1910-1930,' through March 11. Some of the great names in Modernist Russian art -- Malevich, El Lissitsky, Rodchenko, Archipenko and Exter -- were actually born, or identified themselves as, Ukrainian. And this show of more than 70 works by 21 artists , including many interesting lesser-knowns, informs us that their Ukrainian-ness made an impact on their contributions to the Modernist movements of the 20th century. Discoveries in the show include Vsevolod Maksymovych, a painter drawing on Symbolist sources, heavily influenced by classical themes and the campy erotica of the British graphic artist Aubrey Beardsley; and Anatol Petrytsky, a painter and creator of lighthearted, collagelike sketches for classical and avant-garde opera and ballet. Stressing as it does the importance of Ukrainian participation in Modernist art, the show is equally significant in its exposure to Americans of lively talents, largely unknown. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212) 228-0110, ukrainianmuseum.org. (Glueck) * THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'ALBERS AND MOHOLY-NAGY: FROM THE BAUHAUS TO THE NEW WORLD,' through Jan. 21. This vigorously multimedia show traces the trajectories of two Modernist pioneers who overlapped as teachers at the Bauhaus in the 1920s and went on, separately, to influence postwar art and design in the United States. Ranging through painting, sculpture, film, design, prints and commercial art, it clarifies the Bauhaus debt to Russian Constructivism and includes works that presage the \"specific objects\" of the 1960s. Given the peregrinations of young artists among multiple art media, the show could not be more pertinent. The less-known Moholy-Nagy looks especially adventuresome. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Smith) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: KIKI SMITH: 'A GATHERING, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float in \"Kiki Smith\": men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed to its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th St, (212) 570-3676. (Cotter)\nGalleries: Chelsea\nSTEVE MUMFORD: 'THE WAR IN IRAQ' Mr. Mumford this exhibition of paintings based on field drawings and sketches done in four trips to Iraq from April 2003 to October 2004, during which he was embedded with United States military units in Baghdad and the Sunni Triangle. His paintings function differently from news photographs and television images -- they are not so mediated, which is one reason, perhaps, that they are so arresting. Some of his paintings combine drawings or photographs of events he witnessed and those that happened nearby, like his epic, cinematic work \"The Battle of Baquba\" (2006). Postmasters Gallery, 459 West 19th Street, through Dec. 2, (212) 727 3323 or www.postmastersart.com. (Benjamin Genocchio)\nLast Chance\nERNESTO NETO: 'FROM WHAT WE ARE MADE' Mr. Neto presents his version of the miracle of human conception with a luminous white tent the shape of a rainbow, with a thick foam floor, filled with a pile of small, colorful soft sculptures made in pantyhose fabric and stuffed with buckwheat shells. As the viewer enters the space, the floor shifts and subsides, tossing the sculptures and making it hard to stay upright. It is like traversing a marshmallow or wading through a pool of jelly, though with the phantasmagoria of a funhouse in which we can climb and play. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Genocchio) * 'PHANTOM CAPTAIN: ART AND CROWDSOURCING' According to the curator Andrea Grover, \"crowdsourcing\" is a new form of corporate outsourcing that parcels out work to armies of amateurs, and the concept is applied to art in this smart little show of ultracolloaborative projects. Harrell Fletcher and Miranda July posted project assignments on their Web site, www.learningtoloveyoumore.com, and present the work of the respondents. Davy Rothbart edits a magazine made up entirely of found notes, photos and letters contributed by readers; a wall full of such material is here. Allison Wiese compiles and publishes books of recipes by artists. Aaron Koblin and Peter Edmunds ask any and all comers to try their hand at digital drawings. Joseph Beuys's assertion \"Everyone is an artist\" lives on. Apexart, 291 Church Street, near White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-5270; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)",

(The two immortal Albert Hague-Dr. Seuss songs from the television special are included). Bloated at 90 minutes, but the kids didn't seem to mind (1:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)\n'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)\n* 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called \"Little\" Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary-Louise Wilson (as her bed-ridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make \"Grey Gardens\" an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n* 'HEARTBREAK HOUSE' A ripping revival of Shaw's comedy about the English gentry waltzing toward the abyss as the shadow of World War I looms. Philip Bosco, as the admirably sane madman Captain Shotover, and Swoosie Kurtz, as his swaggeringly romantic daughter, lead the superb cast, under the sharp direction of Robin Lefevre. Nearly a century after its composition, the play still sparkles with wit and sends a shiver down the spine too (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)\n'LES MIS\u00c9RABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n* 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood-style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)\n'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)\n'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)\nOff Broadway\n'ALL THE WAY HOME' The play won a Pulitzer Prize, but in this revival by the Transport Group it is Sandra Goldmark's simple, striking set that first gets your attention, and then keeps refocusing it during a show that runs almost three hours. Amid her doll-size houses, the human actors seem like giants, but as the play progresses, it becomes apparent that the characters they play are anything but. The acting is excellent, though the play, centered on a small domestic tragedy, doesn't have the punch it once did (1:35). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Neil Genzlinger)\n'ALL TOO HUMAN' Henry Miller's one-man show about Clarence Darrow is far from scintillating theater, but it's relevant. (1:35) 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates)\n'THE AMERICAN PILOT' The fate of an injured American soldier hangs in the balance when his plane crashes in territory held by rebels fighting a regime backed by the United States. David Greig's play strives for the topical and the universal, but mostly gets hold of the generic (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club's City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)\n'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing, offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Genzlinger)\n'BHUTAN' Daisy Foote's drama may not be working the freshest territory -- dead-end lives in a small town -- but it sure is well told and well acted. A widow and her two teenagers are struggling financially and feeling dislocated by their town's changing social alignments; Sarah Lord is especially good as the daughter whose fascination with a neighbor's trip to Bhutan gives the play its title and overarching metaphor (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger)\n*'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)\n'DAI (ENOUGH)' Iris Bahr's unnerving one-woman show doesn't have much to add to the Middle East debate, but it sure leaves a lasting impression. Ms. Bahr plays an assortment of characters who have the misfortune of being in a Tel Aviv cafe that is about to be visited by the havoc common to such establishments. The attack is rendered in jarring fashion, repeatedly; you watch the play on pins and needles, waiting for the next burst. Gimmicky? Sure. But viscerally effective. Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Genzlinger)\n'DURANGO' In Julia Cho's tender-hearted comedy-drama, a Korean-American family takes to the road with a trunk full of emotional baggage in tow. The narrative mostly runs in familiar grooves, but Ms. Cho has a clear, honest voice, and Chay Yew's production sets it off elegantly (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Isherwood)\n'ESOTERICA' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)\n'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next \"Rocky Horror Show.\" To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00) New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)\n'HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD AND FIND TRUE LOVE IN 90 MINUTES' This refreshing musical, born of the Fringe Festival, about a bookstore clerk, a slacker, a diplomat and a terrorist has witty songs, wacky performances and an untethered sense of fun (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)\n'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates)\n'THE MILLINER' Suzanne Glass's delicate play tells of a Jewish hat-maker who, after fleeing Germany and his beloved mother and business just before World War II, longs to return to Berlin. A vixenish cabaret singer is among the things beckoning him back. The lovely hats, both worn and used as scenery, will make the bare heads of 2006 long for the old days (2:30). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger)\n'MY NAME IS RACHEL CORRIE' A small, intense and loudly heralded one-woman drama that tells the true story of its title character, a pro-Palestinian activist killed in the Gaza strip by an Israeli Army bulldozer. Yet for all the political and emotional baggage carried by this production, adapted from Ms. Corrie's writings and starring Megan Dodds, it often feels dramatically flat, even listless (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)\n'POST MORTEM' A grievance list of a comedy by the indefatigable A. R. Gurney, set in the near future, about the unearthing of a world-shaking play called \"Post Mortem\" by A. R. Gurney. Jim Simpson directs this likable grab bag of insider jokes, polemical satire and cosmic lamentation (1:30). The Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)\n'THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE' A slow, airless revival of Jay Presson Allen's 1966 play (adapted from Muriel Spark's novel) about a dangerous Scottish schoolteacher, directed by Scott Elliott and starring the wonderful (but miscast) Cynthia Nixon, who seems much too sane and centered as the deluded Miss Brody. (2:40). The Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)\n'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quip-meisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)\n'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this old comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). The SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger)\n'SCHOOL FOR WIVES' The Pearl Theater Company's production of Moli\u00e8re's satire about one misguided man's expectations of women is pleasant, occasionally quite funny and definitely on the side of common sense (1:55). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Gates)\n* 'STRIKING 12' A minimalist musical about an odd but rewarding New Year's Eve in the life of a guy who hates New Year's Eve. Performed by the indie pop band Groovelily, it's fresh and funny, and features a standout pop score (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)\n'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER' As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)\n'THE TIMEKEEPERS' Dan Clancy's play, which throws a Jewish artisan and a gay hustler together in a concentration camp, transcends standard Holocaust psychodrama on the strength of its characterizations and definitive performances by Seth Barrish and Eric Paeper (1:35). Barrow Group Theater, 312 West 36th Street, third floor, (212) 760-2615. (Rob Kendt)\n'25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)\nOff Off Broadway\n'THE FORTUNE TELLER' This morality tale for grown-ups is told through marvelously grotesque puppets and a cast, evoking Edward Gorey and Tim Burton. Written by Erik Sanko, it is an allegory of the Seven Deadly Sins, a lovely thing to look upon and listen to (the dark, brooding music is by Mr. Sanko and Danny Elfman), but for all its macabre grisliness, it needs more drama. (1:00). Here Arts Center, 145 Sixth Avenue, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101. (Anne Midgette)\nSpectacles\n'BIG APPLE CIRCUS' One terrific show (2:15). Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500 or (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)\n'RADIO CITY CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR' Mingles tradition and novelty to a festive fare-thee-well (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-1000. (Van Gelder)\nLong-Running Shows\n'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)\n'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

(Isherwood)\n'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)\nLast Chance\n'GREAT EXPECTATIONS' It's hard to improve on Dickens, and the playwright Bathsheba Doran doesn't manage to in the Theatreworks/USA production of her version for families and children. Directed by Will Pomerantz, scenes fly by too fast, and Kathleen Chalfant's Miss Havisham should be frightening rather than eccentric. But as her icy prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, Estella, Kristen Bush is near perfect (1:20). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Andrea Stevens)\n'JOB'S PASSION' The Israeli playwright Hanoch Levin's blending of two biblical characters, Job and Jesus, sometimes flaunts irreverence for irreverence's sake but finds both dizzying humor and rich meaning in human misery (2:00). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 254-1109; closing on Sunday. (Gates)\n'MIMI LE DUCK' This musical, seen in 2004 at the New York International Fringe Festival, has morphed into a campy celebration of Eartha Kitt, who, just short of her 80th birthday, milks a minor role gleefully. The main order of business, though, is a middle-aged, middle-American housewife (Annie Golden), who, at the urging of Hemingway's ghost, goes to Paris in search of her true self. Diana Hansen-Young, who wrote the book and lyrics, seems to get most of her not-very-revolutionary ideas from mainstream women's magazines (2:05). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger)\n'ROMANIA. KISS ME!' A worthwhile collection of six short plays by young Romanian playwrights who grew up after the fall of Ceausescu's regime (2:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Jason Zinoman)\n'WOYZECK' This improbably vivacious London-born production of Buchner's great, prophetic drama of existential emptiness finds the bleak rhythm of life in, of all things, the music of Elvis Presley. While Daniel Kramer's production is more flash than feeling, it features a first-rate, gymnastically stylized performance from Edward Hogg in the title role (2:20). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779; closing on Sunday .

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.\n* 'THE AURA' (No rating, 138 minutes, in Spanish) A heist, a case of mistaken identity and a lonely, epileptic taxidermist are at the heart of this melancholy, deeply satisfying noir exercise, the second and last feature directed by the Argentine filmmaker Fabi\u00e1n Bielinsky, who died in June. (A. O. Scott)\n'BACKSTAGE' (No rating, 112 minutes, in French) Beautifully acted and uncomfortably believable much of the time, this close-up study of the toxic relationship of a narcissistic French pop star and a besotted teenage fan produces a feeling of emotional claustrophobia. (Stephen Holden)\n'BOBBY' (R, 111 minutes) Emilio Estevez's picture, which follows a score of characters through the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, is full of noble ambition. The day in question ended with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, an event that hovers over the movie, even though Kennedy himself is visible only in archival clips. A huge cast (including Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Lindsay Lohan and Mr. Estevez) labors to inject a collection of melodramatic anecdotes with portent and significance, but the individual parts of the film tend to be either overdone or vague and slight. (Scott)\n* 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN,' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Manohla Dargis) 'CASINO ROYALE' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The latest James Bond vehicle finds the British spy leaner, meaner and now played by an attractive piece of blond rough named Daniel Craig. Zap, pow, ka-ching! (Dargis)\n'DECK THE HALLS' (PG, 95 minutes) In the holiday tradition of stale fruitcake, ugly snowflake sweaters and food poisoning comes this piece of junk, in which Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito compete to see who can annoy the audience more. (Scott)\n'D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU' (PG-13, 125 minutes) In Tony Scott's preposterous action flick, with Denzel Washington, the gaudy pyrotechnics are nowhere near as jaw-dropping as the screenplay that name-checks not one, not two, but three national tragedies. ( Dargis)\n'DHOOM 2' (No rating, 151 minutes, in Hindi) A slick and satisfying example of the new, thoroughly modern Bollywood, this cops-and-robbers tale is animated by old-fashioned star power. Hrithik Roshan plays the \"smartest and coolest thief alive,\" and Aishwarya Rai is the small-time crook who loves him. (Rachel Saltz)\n'EATING OUT 2: SLOPPY SECONDS' (No rating, 85 minutes) A Rubik's Cube of shifting sexual orientation and elaborate fantasies, this film follows a young gay man who joins an \"ex-gay\" group in his quest to bed a hot male model. Gathering all the accouterments of soft pornography -- cheesy music, low-rent acting and attractively framed genitals -- into a plot of stunning imbecility, the director, Phillip J. Bartel, is most amusing in his zeal to demonstrate the fruitlessness of right-wing efforts to reorient gay men. (Jeannette Catsoulis)\n* 'FAST FOOD NATION' (R, 106 minutes) Richard Linklater has turned Eric Schlosser's journalistic expos\u00e9 of the American industrial food system into a thoughtful, occasionally rambling inquiry into the contradictions of contemporary American life. Three stories examine different parts of the capitalist food chain: illegal immigrants from Mexico work in terrible conditions in a meat-processing plant; a restaurant chain executive undergoes a crisis of conscience; and a teenage burger-slinger is drawn into political activism. Mr. Linklater covers a lot of ground, and the result is an unusually funny, moving and intellectually demanding movie. (Scott)\n* 'FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' (R, 132 minutes) Clint Eastwood raises the flag over Iwo Jima once more in a powerful if imperfect film about the uses of war and of the men who fight. The fine cast includes Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach, who delivers heartbreak by the payload. (Dargis)\n'FLANNEL PAJAMAS' (No rating, 124 minutes) The twin specters of Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen hover over this film, which might have been more accurately titled \"Scenes From a Mixed Marriage\" or \"Annie Hall Without Laughs.\" This smart, talky history of a relationship between two New Yorkers follows a Jewish theatrical promoter and an aspiring caterer from a Roman Catholic background from courtship to marriage to separation. (Holden)\n* 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (\"Wallace and Gromit,\" \"Chicken Run\") is completely delightful. (Scott)\n'THE FOUNTAIN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Darren Aronovsky's new film spans a thousand years, as Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman pursue undying love and eternal life in the 16th, 21st and 26th centuries. There is some lovely visual poetry, but the ideas are pure doggerel, an ungainly mixture of sci-fi overreach and earnest sentimentality. (Scott)\n'FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION' (PG-13, 86 minutes) This satire of pre-Oscar nomination buzz in Hollywood is far and away the broadest comedy Christopher Guest and his improvisatory company have made. It is also the flimsiest, and unlike Mr. Guest's earlier films, it has no airs of being a fake documentary. As farce trumps satire, the humor's subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, except for the brilliant exception of Catherine O'Hara. (Holden)\n'HAPPY FEET' (PG, 100 minutes) The director George Miller gets happy and snappy, then goes dark and deep, in a musical about an animated penguin who was born to dance. Take hankies. (Dargis)\n'THE HISTORY BOYS' (R, 104 minutes) The current of intellectual energy snapping through this engaging screen adaptation of Alan Bennett's Tony Award-winning play, set in a north England boys' school in 1983, feels like electrical brain stimulation. As two teachers jockey for the hearts and minds of eight teenage schoolboys preparing to apply to Oxford and Cambridge, their epigrams send up small jolts of pleasure and excitement. How to teach and interpret history is the question. (Holden)\n'INVISIBLE' (No rating, 86 minutes) Absent parents cause no end of bother in this moody thriller about an unhappily married couple, a remote cabin and a pair of homicidal crazies. Unfortunately, the director, Adam Watstein, is so invested in his theme of nature as emotional healer that the movie's abrupt transition from lush travelogue to murky violence feels jarring and unearned. As both victims and attackers trade abandonment issues \"Invisible\" suggests that weekend getaways are best approached, if not with a pistol, then at least with a firm grasp of psychobabble. (Catsoulis)\n'LET'S GO TO PRISON' (R, 84 minutes) Sure, it has shower scenes, but they're sly and restrained rather than frat house obvious, and all the funnier for it. Dax Shepard is hilariously deadpan as a petty criminal who retaliates against a judge by contriving for the man's son (Will Arnett) to be arrested and then purposely being arrested himself so he can harass the prissy fellow. Chi McBride is perfect as a fellow inmate with a taste for prison lovin' and a voice like Barry White's. (Neil Genzlinger)\n* 'OUR DAILY BREAD' (No rating, 92 minutes) In this superb documentary the Austrian filmmaker Nikolaus Geyrhalter takes an unblinking, often disturbing look at industrial food production from field to factory. You are what you eat; as it happens, you are also what you dare to watch. (Dargis)\n'TENACIOUS D IN THE PICK OF DESTINY' (R, 87 minutes) As it wobbles from one episode to the next, this rock 'n' roll comedy starring Jack Black is a garish mess, and some of it feels padded. But it has enough jokes to keep you smiling, and Mr. Black brings to it a fervent affection for the music he spoofs but obviously adores. (Holden)\n* 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Alm\u00f3dovar, with Pen\u00e9lope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date.

But at least Mr. Adams can deliver the goods. Within his unnecessarily voluminous output -- he released three full-length albums last year and posts new songs to his Web site by the dozen -- is some astonishingly beautiful work.

(Ben Sisario)\nBLIND BOYS OF ALABAMA (Tomorrow) After more than 60 years as a group, the Blind Boys of Alabama are no longer boys, but gray-haired pillars of gospel quartet singing. Led by Clarence Fountain, they proclaim their reverence in close harmonies and gutsy improvisations that leap heavenward. At 8 p.m., B. B.

(Jon Pareles)\nBRIAN JONESTOWN MASSACRE (Sunday) This tuneless headache of a band, modeled on the jangly psychedelic rock of mid-1960s Britain and Los Angeles, was well on its way into obscurity when, two years ago, it was featured in a hit documentary, \"Dig!,\" and a legend was created. Since then the band has toured widely, to audiences who wait for its leader, Anton Newcombe, to lash out in paranoia and kick a fan in the head, as he did in the film. With A Place to Bury Strangers. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20. (Sisario)\nCONVERGE (Tonight) The guitar riffs of this Boston band come like a spray of machine gun bullets, rapid and unrelenting. The violent rasp of Jacob Bannon, the singer, is just as deadly. With Some Girls, Modern Life Is War, and Blacklisted. At 6, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $15. (Sisario)\nCOPELAND (Sunday) Rueful piano ballads that lead to teary, guitar-drenched, not-quite-cathartic peaks: the songs of this Florida band strongly resemble those of Coldplay and Keane. But while its passion is sincere, Copeland lacks something in the sophistication department. (\"I'm in love with my doubt/It's freaking me out.\") With Appleseed Cast, Owen and Acute. At 6:45 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $15 in advance, $17 at the door.

(Tonight and tomorrow night) One of the greatest and most influential original grunge bands, Dinosaur Jr. joined mopey lyrics to furious guitar sludge, a juxtaposition that prefigured Nirvana. Long estranged, the original lineup of J Mascis on guitar, Lou Barlow on bass and Murph on drums reunited last year, sounding brawny and vigorous; their first album together in 18 years is to be released in the spring. At 9, Rebel, 251 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 695-2747, rebelnyc.com; $25.

(Pareles)\nJEREMY ENIGK (Thursday) In the 1990s Mr. Enigk was the leader of Sunny Day Real Estate, a Seattle group that did as much as anybody to transform emo from a relatively obscure offshoot of hardcore punk into the populist form of yearning and tantrum-throwing that it is today. This fall he released his first solo album in a decade, \"World Waits\" (Lewis Hollow).

(Pareles)\n* THE GRATES (Wednesday) Playful and capricious, this guitar-drums-vocals trio from Brisbane, Australia, led by the frequently airborne Patience Hodgson, reaches back to classic 1990s riot grrrl for its passionate amateurism. But on its ambitious debut album, \"Gravity Won't Get You High\" (Cherrytree/Interscope), the band is unburdened by any legacy, going from hip-swaying sassy to defiant and tough, all with a sense that nothing in life is worth getting too upset about (\"No I'll never believe the truth in you/Lies are much more fun\"). With the White Rabbits, Tigercity and Cassettes Won't Listen. At 7:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10.

(Sisario)\nKLEZMATICS (Monday) This veteran New York band has had a major influence on the bohemian rediscovery and reinvention of klezmer music, the somewhat jazzy dance music of Eastern European Jews. So it made perfect sense when Nora Guthrie, the daughter and archivist of Woody Guthrie, approached the members a few years ago to write music for lyrics that Guthrie wrote in the 1940s and '50s, when he lived on Coney Island with his second wife, Marjorie Mazia, and her Jewish family. There the Dust Bowl troubadour ate blintzes, lighted the menorah and wrote about Hanukkah in the plainspoken, unmistakably Guthrie style: \"It's honeyky Hanukkah, shaky my hand/My candles are burning all over this land.\" The Klezmatics play these songs, as collected on a new album, \"Woody Guthrie's Happy Joyous Hanukkah\" (Jewish Music Group). At 7:30 p.m., Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101, henrystreet.org/arts; $20. (Sisario)\nDAVID KRAKAUER'S KLEZMER MADNESS (Tomorrow) Well into an illustrious career as a classical clarinetist, Mr. Krakauer stumbled onto klezmer, and his endless curiosity in adapting it to avant-garde jazz, rock and even Latin styles has brought him a wide new audience. For this concert he collaborates with Fred Wesley, the funk trombonist who was a key member of James Brown's band in the 1960s and '70s; and with SoCalled, a k a Josh Dolgin, a Canadian D.J. and keyboardist whose efforts at infusing hip-hop with Jewish identity -- or perhaps the other way around -- include an album, \"The SoCalled Seder\" (JDub). At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to $35. (Sisario)\nLOS AMIGOS INVISIBLES (Tonight) Los Amigos Invisibles, from Venezuela, latch on to dance grooves from the last three decades: James Brown funk, the stolid thump of house music, mid-1960s boogaloo, '70s Miami disco, Santana's mambo-rock, even some rap, while the lyrics (in Spanish) are come-ons somewhere between charm and smarm.

The concept is high, but the effect of the pungently close harmonies and intense percussive yips is immediate and transcendent.

(Sisario)\n* 'RED HOT + RIOT LIVE' (Tonight and tomorrow night) A tribute to the inimitable Fela Kuti, the Nigerian master of Afrobeat who, on dozens of albums from the early 1970s until his death from AIDS nine years ago, merged James Brown's funk with the chants and polyrhythms of Africa, and used his music as a populist political cudgel against corrupt authority. The lineup for this concert, a benefit for the African Services Committee, an AIDS and H.I.V. support group, includes Tony Allen, Fela's longtime drummer; the eclectic Nigerian duo Amadou and Mariam; Cheikh Lo, from Senegal; Meshell Ndegeocello, the American bassist and funk ambassador; Dead Prez, a politically minded rap duo from Brooklyn; Keziah Jones, a Nigerian singer-songwriter; and Yerba Buena, a New York Latin band, playing with the jazz-funk keyboardist John Medeski.

(Sisario)\nTHE STILLS (Tonight and tomorrow night) On its debut album three years ago, this Montreal band took the sulking guitar minimalism of New York groups like Interpol and the Strokes and sublimated it into a shimmering, majestic gloom that recalled the glories of U2 and Echo and the Bunnymen. Its most recent album, \"Without Feathers\" (Vice), perplexingly slows things down to a bored crawl. With Au Revoir Simone and Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin tonight, and Favourite Sons and A Brief Smile tomorrow night.

Rolando Villaz\u00f3n, the charismatic Mexican tenor, is a convincing Rodolfo, although he seems somewhat dwarfed by the massive sets. But sparks should fly on Tuesday when Anna Netrebko, the gorgeous Russian soprano, sings Mimi. Tonight Angela Marambio, the Chilean soprano, offers a warm-voiced, robust Mimi. Mr. Villaz\u00f3n's mentor and idol, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, leads the orchestra in a fine, lively performance. Anna Samuil replaces Susannah Glanville as Musetta both nights, and Peter Coleman-Wright is her jealous lover, Marcello. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $110 and $140 tickets remain for tonight; Tuesday is sold out. (Vivien Schweitzer)\n* 'DON CARLO' (Monday and Thursday) James Levine will be in the pit when Verdi's noble masterpiece returns to the Met in John Dexter's production.

At 7 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $175. (Anthony Tommasini)\n'IDOMENEO' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) In place of the dramatic tenor Ben Heppner, the clarion-voiced tenor Kobie van Rensburg takes over the title role in Mozart's noble opera seria \"Idomeneo,\" which has returned to the company's roster in Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's highly stylized and effective 1982 production. There are two other cast changes: the elegant mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena sings Idamante, and the bright-voiced soprano Alexandra Deshorties sings the volatile Elettra. Best of all, Dorothea R\u00f6schmann, a superb soprano, returns as Ilia. James Levine conducts. Tomorrow at 1 p.m. and Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $220 tomorrow, $15 to $175 on Wednesday. (Tommasini)\n'LORD BYRON'S LOVE LETTER'/'THE VILLAGE SINGER' (Wednesday) The operatization of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" by Andr\u00e9 Previn might have obscured the fact that Tennessee Williams did write a single opera libretto of his own. It's \"Lord Byron's Love Letter,\" set by the composer Raffaello de Banfield, first performed in 1955 and nearly forgotten since. Now the Manhattan School of Music Opera Theater continues its cultivation of neglected American opera by bringing the work (which is about, what else, dotty old Southern ladies) back for its New York premiere, on a double bill with Stephen Paulus's \"Village Singer.\" Ari Pelto conducts. At 8 p.m., Broadway at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (917) 493-4428, msmnyc.edu; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Anne Midgette)\n'SUOR ANGELICA'/'GIANNI SCHICCHI' (Tomorrow and Sunday).

(Midgette)\n'TOSCA' (Tomorrow) Andrea Gruber is a soprano who flings herself into roles; accordingly, she takes on her first Tosca with a certain violence. The character becomes tough yet vulnerable in her reading, yet the vulnerability is perhaps too pronounced in her uneven, patchy singing. She resumes the role for the season's final performance tomorrow, paired with the Cavaradossi of Walter Fraccaro and the Met's perennial Scarpia these days, James Morris. The real news is the conductor Nicola Luisotti in his first Met season, who conducts the piece as if it mattered. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $220.

Included are Arriaga's String Quartet No. 3, Leonardo Balada's Caprichos No. 2 and Boccherini's Quintet No. 4 for guitar and strings, best known for its zesty fandango. Mr. Fisk will also play some solo guitar music. At 7, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $45. (Kozinn)\nJUAN DIEGO FL\u00d3REZ (Tonight) The darling of the Metropolitan Opera these days, this Peruvian tenor is making a Carnegie Hall recital debut that Carnegie Hall, interestingly, is not presenting. Mr. Fl\u00f3rez's voice can be a little bleaty for some tastes, but it's always thoughtfully, carefully produced, with clean coloratura and excellent musicianship. His program includes Mozart, Faur\u00e9, Massenet, Bizet, Rosa Mercedes Ayala de Morales, Donizetti and, of course, Rossini, his signature composer.

So intensely lifelike are the fiberglass and silicone human figures made by the Australian sculptor Ron Mueck that you might almost converse with them. Ranging in size from an infant that is 10 and a quarter inches high to a woman in bed more than 21 feet long, they seem to embody, in one way or another, the perils and challenges of the human condition. The most affecting are \"Dead Dad,\" a 40-inch rendering of the artist's father as a nude corpse, and \"Man in a Boat,\" in which a man a little more than two feet high sits naked and hapless toward the prow of a life-size rowboat. But Mr. Mueck stumbles when he gets into really exaggerated scale. The subject has not earned its monumentality, and its size distracts from its emotional intensity. Still, there are moments when you almost believe his subjects have lives. 200 Eastern Parkway at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck)\nBROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'Watercolors by Walton Ford,' through Jan. 28. This show assembles more than 50 of Mr. Ford's large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora, all produced since the early 1990s. They frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images you merely sense that some horrible violence has occurred, or is about to happen. Though wonderfully lucid and dramatic, the moralizing of these images can become a little tedious. But this popular artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. (See above.) (Benjamin Genocchio)\n* Frick Collection: 'MASTERPIECES OF EUROPEAN PAINTING FROM THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART,' through Jan. 28. This exhibition transcends the usual traveling masterpieces-from genre, with room to spare. The 14 paintings include almost always outstanding works by household names like Vel\u00e1zquez, Caravaggio, El Greco, Turner and Poussin, as well as Annibale Carracci, Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n and Andrea del Sarto. But the astute installation makes the most of all this star power, letting the works talk among themselves to a remarkable degree, illuminating their likenesses, differences and collective progress. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Smith)\n* SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso,' through March 28. This show is spectacularly grand and avoids the familiar piety of the standard masterpiece potpourri by virtue of its eloquent installation in the museum's loopy ramp. It's carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Vel\u00e1zquezes and Zurbar\u00e1ns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dal\u00eds and Picassos, many famous, many not. The show's big point, which has the simple virtue of being self-evident, is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Vel\u00e1zquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman)\n* THE METropolitan museum of art: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s,' through Feb. 19. This show's 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)\n* THE MET: 'LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL -- AN ARTIST'S COUNTRY ESTATE,' through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound -- and of the Tiffany residences preceding it -- is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (See above.) (Smith)\n* Museum of Modern Art: 'Manet and the Execution of Maximilian,' through Jan. 29. This small, gripping, focused show remind us of Modernism's mutinous, myth-scouring origins. And it does so by bringing one of art's great path-cutters, Edouard Manet, onto the scene, wry, politically infuriated and painting like Lucifer. There's not a lot of him here -- eight paintings, three on a single theme: the death by firing squad of the Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian in Mexico in 1867. But it's enough. Manet's images, surrounded by a prints and photographs, are electrifying, a new kind of history painting, that turned an art of pre-set ideals into one of mutable and unpredictable realities. (212) 708-9400. (Holland Cotter)\n* NEUE GALLERY: 'JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,' through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or \"total work of art,\" orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. Neue Gallery, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)\nNew-York Historical Society: 'New York Divided: Slavery and the Civil War,' through Sept. 3. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historic objects, shows how divided the city was, even during the years of the Civil War. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery's horrific heritage. It brings to a close the Historical Society's multi-year exploration of slavery in New York. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400. (Edward Rothstein)\nP.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'John Latham: Time Base and the Universe,' through Jan. 8. This retrospective of John Latham, who died this year at 84, suggests a series of nesting time capsules. It spans nearly 50 years of Mr. Latham's work, which is concerned with time, preservation and decay. Among the more idiosyncratic and interesting pieces are a series of \"Cluster\" sculptures from the early 1990s, orbs of plaster embedded with books and suspended from the ceiling, which suggest cultural detritus preserved in celestial rock or geological magma. \"The N-U Niddrie Heart\" (around 1990), in which \"The Pregnancy Survival Manual\" and \"Vanished Species\" are cut up and fitted into glass armatures, with sand scattered around their bases, explores human production (and reproduction) and the passage of time. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Martha Schwendener)\nStudio Museum in Harlem: 'Africa Comics,' through March 18. Intense is the word for the stealth-potency of this modest-size, first-time United States survey of original designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense,the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. The entertainment value is high. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids, and the schlumpy but wily character named Goorgoolou from Senegal. But more often than not, humor is sugar-coating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter)\n* UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'CROSSROADS: MODERNISM IN UKRAINE, 1910-1930,' through March 11. Some of the great names in Modernist Russian art -- Malevich, El Lissitsky, Rodchenko, Archipenko and Exter -- were actually born, or identified themselves as, Ukrainian. And this show of more than 70 works by 21 artists, including many interesting lesser-knowns, informs us that their Ukrainian-ness made an impact on their contributions to the Modernist movements of the 20th century. Discoveries in the show include Vsevolod Maksymovych, a painter drawing on Symbolist sources, heavily influenced by classical themes and the campy erotica of the British graphic artist Aubrey Beardsley; and Anatol Petrytsky, a painter and creator of lighthearted, collagelike sketches for classical and avant-garde opera and ballet. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212) 228-0110, ukrainianmuseum.org. (Glueck)\n* The Whitney Museum of American Art: 'ALBERS AND MOHOLY-NAGY: FROM THE BAUHAUS TO THE NEW WORLD,' through Jan. 21. This vigorously multimedia show traces the trajectories of two Modernist pioneers who overlapped as teachers at the Bauhaus in the 1920s and went on, separately, to influence postwar art and design in the United States. Ranging through painting, sculpture, film, design, prints and commercial art, it clarifies the Bauhaus debt to Russian Constructivism and includes works that presage the \"specific objects\" of the 1960s. Given the peregrinations of young artists among multiple art media, the show could not be more pertinent. The less-known Moholy-Nagy looks especially adventuresome. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Smith)\nWhitney Museum of American Art: Kiki Smith: 'A Gathering, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float in \"Kiki Smith\": men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed to its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. (See above.) (Cotter)\nGalleries: Chelsea\nFred W. McDarrah: 'Artists and Writers of the 60s and 70s' This show of more than 100 photographs by the former Village Voice photographer and picture editor Fred W. McDarrah opens with a shot of Jack Kerouac and some frolicsome women at a 1958 New Year's Eve bash. It is hastily grabbed and opportunistic, like much of Mr. McDarrah's work, for he operated independently, rarely working on assignment. There are groupings of artists in their studios (Alice Neel, Philip Guston, Jasper Johns); actors (Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro on the set of \"Taxi Driver\"); and musicians (Janis Joplin, Bob Dylan). Mr. McDarrah's best-known image may be his 1965 close-up of Bob Dylan, dressed all in black and saluting, his countenance as earnest as that of a battle-hardened marine. It is an enduring symbol of the era's antiwar protests, rebellion and counterculture. Steven Kasher Gallery521 West 23rd Street, (212) 966-3978, stevenkasher.com, through Jan. 5. (Genocchio)\nOther Galleries\n* 'Political Cartoons from Nigeria' Most of the drawn and painted images here are single-panel lampoons of past and present social inequity and corruption in Nigeria. Nearly all are by Ghariokwu Lemi, famous for his 26 superb, incident-filled album covers for Fela Kuti. For the occasion, the artist introduces two younger colleagues, Comfort Jacobs and Lordwealth Ololade, to New York. Without at all resembling him in style, they follow his sharp commentarial lead. Southfirst, 60 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-4884, through Dec. 17. (Cotter)\nLast Chance\nSTEVE MUMFORD: 'THE WAR IN IRAQ' This exhibition of paintings is based on Mr. Mumford's field drawings and sketches done in four trips to Iraq from April 2003 to October 2004. His paintings function differently from news photographs and television images -- they are not so mediated, which is one reason, perhaps, that they are so arresting. Postmasters Gallery, 459 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727 3323 or www.postmastersart.com; closes tomorrow. (Genocchio)",

Such a ban would be impractical, difficult and economically harmful for business travelers. \nYes, the possible loss or damage of checked electronic devices is a concern, but that concern involves more than the cost or inconvenience. There\u2019s a simple reason business travelers bring electronic items: we need them where we\u2019re going.\nI\u2019ll give an example. I\u2019m a freelance journalist. Last year I flew to England for a day for an interview. If my laptop, notebooks and voice recorder had been misplaced by the airline for even 24 hours, that trip would have been almost worthless. I would have missed my deadline and could have lost a major story.\nThat is an economic risk I cannot afford to take, and if airlines cannot guarantee me the ability to personally secure my own belongings, I will fly only for trips that are impossible by other means. \nJoe Lindsey Boulder, Colo., Sept. 10, 2006\n\u2022\nTo the Editor:\n The suggestion that airlines ban all carry-on luggage glosses over some serious difficulties for many travelers. \nFor example, I routinely travel with not just a laptop, but also a few thousand dollars\u2019 worth of camera equipment. \nGiven the flinging and smashing of baggage that I have observed from the plane window before takeoff, there is no way that I would entrust these delicate and expensive items to the typical baggage handler. \nFurthermore, members of my family have had lesser items (small change, clean shirts!) pilfered from checked luggage. \nUntil baggage handling and antitheft measures are greatly improved, there will always be items that travelers will need to retain in their own possession as carry-on items. \n David Rintoul Manhattan, Kan., Sept. 10, 2006\n\u2022 \nTo the Editor:\nThere is nothing more nerve-racking than boarding a crowded flight with my violin. I\u2019ve received more dirty looks over the years while trying to put my instrument in the overhead bin while some jerk makes a big deal of his regulation 22-inch suitcase. \nAnd then there\u2019s the probably apocryphal story about the cellist who arrives at the check-in desk, instrument in hand, who declares that he has an \u201coboe\u201d (permitted on the list) and is allowed to board. \n It is unreasonable to require musicians to put irreplaceable instruments in the unpressurized hold, not to mention on the luggage carousels. Businessmen are worried about \u201cvaluable electronic devices,\u201d but my violin and bow are worth easily 30 times the value of my laptop \u2014 and I certainly don\u2019t have a Stradivarius (though one can dream!). \nI am all for reducing carry-on items on airplanes, but there needs to be an intermediate solution. Otherwise, I\u2019d better book tickets on the QE2. \n Elizabeth Adams New Haven, Sept. 10, 2006\n\u2022\nTo the Editor:\nWhat would you ban next \u2014 all parcels on trains and in the subway? What about on buses, where a dirty bomb could do untold damage? \nI have a better idea. Get the government out of the screening business altogether. Make sure that the pilots\u2019 area is totally secure so that the airplane cannot be taken over. Then leave boarding security entirely to the airline.\nThe airlines, you can be sure, will be eager to protect their property.
