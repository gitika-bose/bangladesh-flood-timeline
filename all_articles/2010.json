    "text": "Environmental Refugees Unable to Return Home\n2010-01-03T21:56:06.000Z\nDHAKA, BANGLADESH \u2014 Mahe Noor left her village in southern Bangladesh after Cyclone Sidr flattened her family\u2019s home and small market in 2007. Jobless and homeless, she and her husband, Nizam Hawladar, moved to this crowded megalopolis, hoping that they might soon return home.\nTwo years later, they are still here. Ms. Noor, 25, and Mr. Hawladar, 35, work long hours at low-paying jobs \u2014 she at a garment factory and he at a roadside tea stall. They are unable to save money after paying for food and rent on their dark shanty in Korail, one of the largest slums in Dhaka. And in their village, more people are leaving because of river erosion and dwindling job opportunities.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trapped,\u201d Ms. Noor said.\nNatural calamities have plagued humanity for generations. But with the prospect of worsening climate conditions over the next few decades, experts on migration say tens of millions more people in the developing world could be on the move because of disasters.\nRather than seeking a new life elsewhere in a mass international \u201cclimate migration,\u201d as some analysts had once predicted, many of these migrants are now expected to move to nearby megacities in their own countries.\n\u201cEnvironmental refugees have lost everything,\u201d said Rabab Fatima, the South Asia representative of the International Organization for Migration. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the money to make a big move. They move to the next village, the next town and eventually to a city.\u201d\nSuch rapid and unplanned urbanization is expected to put even further strains on scarce water, energy and food resources, said Koko Warner, who works in environmental migration at the United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security in Bonn. \nIn Bangladesh, a largely flat, riverine nation where more than 140 million people live in one of the most densely populated countries in the world, past generations often moved to cities seasonally. They worked to send money home to their villages and usually returned there during planting season.\nBut in recent years, the moves are more likely to be permanent. More intense storms and floods, salinization damage to crops caused by the encroaching sea and especially worsening river erosion have left many people rootless, Ms. Fatima said.\nDhaka, the capital, is often the only real option in this region. It is the fastest-growing megacity in the world, according to the World Bank. At least 12 million people live in Dhaka, and there are more than 400,000 newcomers each year. The World Bank predicts that the population could grow dramatically by 2020.\nLike the rest of Bangladesh, Dhaka is also extremely vulnerable to climate change: It is just a few meters above sea level and is regularly hit by cyclones and floods. The environmental group WWF recently rated it among the megacities most vulnerable to the effects of global warming, after Jakarta and Manila.\nAs many as half of the people in Dhaka live in shantytowns and slums, says Atiq Rahman, a climate change researcher and executive director of the Bangladesh Center for Advanced Studies. Of those, Mr. Rahman and Ms. Fatima estimate that three million people have been displaced by environmental degradation or disasters.\nThe most destitute people live in clusters of improvised tents made of plastic sheets and discarded bamboo and often erected on private land near markets, railroad tracks and the city\u2019s rivers.\nMost poor, working-class families end up in minicities like Korail, where Ms. Noor, the migrant from southern Bangladesh, lives with her husband and two daughters. Ms. Noor\u2019s third child, a son, lives with his grandmother in the family\u2019s village. \nKorail sits on public land and is shared by at least 40,000 people crowded into cramped, cockroach-infested rental shanties made of mud, bamboo and corrugated tin. \nBarefoot children play with broken marbles on narrow mud lanes filled with garbage and streams of raw sewage. A few enterprising residents have opened vegetable stands, tailor shops, carpentry mills and teahouses in tiny shacks.\nAid groups run primary schools in Korail and other slums, but many children work or stay home to mind younger siblings while their parents work.\nChild trafficking and arson are serious problems, experts here say. Ms. Noor says she worries she will come home one day and find her young daughters kidnapped, or worse.\n\u201cEvery day I hear about a fire or about someone\u2019s child missing,\u201d Ms. Noor said.\nMs. Noor\u2019s next-door neighbor, Aklima Akhter, 22, also lost her home and her family\u2019s small market in her southern Bangladesh village to flooding caused by Cyclone Sidr.\nAnother neighbor, Mukhles Rahman, 38, and his brother Mohammad Farid Uddin, 56, left their village of Chawlakathi in the division of Barisal eight years ago because of river erosion. \nTheir family once grew rice, jute, sugar cane, mustard seed and radishes on four hectares, or 10 acres. Over a couple of decades, the Sandhya River washed away the farmland and the family home.\n\u201cMy father could cross the river just by jumping across,\u201d said Mr. Uddin, who finished high school and ran a small school in his village. \u201cEven when I was a youngster in the 1960s, we could swim across. Now it\u2019s so big.\u201d\nThese days, the two brothers live in a tiny shanty with Mukhles Rahman\u2019s wife and young son. \n\u201cWe are trying to find another place to go, because all the land back home is dissolving,\u201d said Mukhles Rahman, who works as a security guard at a garment factory. \u201cBut there aren\u2019t jobs in other cities or in villages.\u201d\nFor migrants displaced because of the environment, Bangladesh hopes to begin helping them find opportunities in cities other than Dhaka, said Saleemul Huq, a Bangladeshi scientist who is a senior fellow in the climate change group of the International Institute for Environment and Development in London.\nBangladesh and other countries hit hard by climate change are supposed to receive money from a $100 billion annual green climate fund approved by the negotiators at the Copenhagen summit meeting in December. Smaller amounts of aid have been pledged for the next few years. The larger amounts of environmental aid are not expected to begin flowing until 2020.\nLater this year, Mr. Huq will open and lead the International Center for Climate Change and Development, an institute based just outside of Dhaka and aimed at helping vulnerable countries come up with practical ways to adapt to climate change. \n\u201cWe are going to have low-lying areas in Bangladesh that are not going to be inhabitable anymore, so those people will have to go somewhere,\u201d Mr. Huq said. While Dhaka has managed to absorb millions of migrants, he said that this \u201ccan\u2019t go on forever. Dhaka can\u2019t take it, and neither can the people.\u201d\nRashida Akhter, a local manager for BRAC, a nongovernmental organization that operates across Bangladesh as well as in several other poor countries, says that more than 90 percent of the Korail slum\u2019s residents never leave because they cannot save enough money to move. \nMs. Noor and Mr. Hawladar say they cannot imagine growing old in a dank, depressing place like Korail. They still dream about returning to their home village of Nandikathi, a poor, waterlogged hamlet of about 3,000 people. \n\u201cIt\u2019s our home, not Dhaka\u201d Mr. Hawladar said.\nTheir 6-year-old son is in Nandikathi with his grandmother. They have not seen him for a year. If they lived there, their daughters, ages 8 and 3, would be able to go to school, instead of being stuck alone all day in a tiny rented shack.\nMs. Noor, who remembers a modest but more comfortable life in Nandikathi, talks about rebuilding the family\u2019s shattered hut and reviving her drowned backyard garden of greens and gourds. \nMr. Hawladar says he wants to open another market there and add a tea house. He was badly injured in a road accident a few years ago and cannot do physical labor, so he spends 15-hour days in a wooden roadside stall in an affluent Dhaka neighborhood, brewing tea for businessmen. He makes 150 taka, or $2, a day. Ms. Noor makes about $1 a day at the garment factory.\nThey count their earnings at night, in silence, on the wooden plank that serves as the family bed. They never have enough money.\nEven if they could save enough money to rebuild their home, the prospects are bleak in Nandikathi. The nearby Dhanshiri River has become more unruly, eroding land and livelihoods.\nMs. Noor says she sometimes stays up until the morning, worrying that the next big flood will just wash the village away.\n\u201cWhere will people live then?\u201d she asked.

    "text": "Poisoned Wells: In Asia, Cutting Arsenic Risk in Water Through Well-Drilling Techniques\n2010-05-31T19:15:11.000Z\nArsenic is so common in groundwater in Bangladesh, Nepal, western India, Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam \u0097 all heavily populated countries in the flood plains draining the Himalayas \u0097 that their drinking water has been called \u201cthe largest poisoning of a population in history.\u201d\nBut a recent study in Science magazine suggests simple well-drilling techniques that could lower the risk. The arsenic comes from eroding Himalayan coal seams and rocks containing sulfides; it is released into the groundwater only under certain chemical conditions deep underground. Some of those are affected by human activities, including pumping out huge volumes of water for irrigation. Different-colored sands may indicate how likely an aquifer is to be dangerous: rusty orange sands full of iron oxides often have less dissolved arsenic in the water around them than gray-colored sands do. Any village may have many orange and gray layers at different depths underneath it, and villagers may unknowingly live near both safe and dangerous wells. But testing is usually inadequate.\n Therefore, the authors \u0097 geologists from Stanford, Columbia and the University of Delaware \u0097 suggest that wells for drinking water should be drilled in deep orange sands and connected to low-pressure hand pumps, while wells connected to high-pressure pumps for crop irrigation should be kept out of those deep aquifers so they do not empty them of safe water, which would cause arsenic-laden water to migrate downward into them.",

    "text": "Burmese Refugees Persecuted in Bangladesh\n2010-02-20T21:08:58.000Z\nBANGKOK \u0097 Stateless refugees from Myanmar are suffering beatings and deportation in Bangladesh, according to aid workers and rights groups who say thousands are crowding into a squalid camp where they face starvation and disease.\n In a campaign that seems to have accelerated since October, the groups say, ethnic Rohingya refugees who have been living for years in Bangladesh are being seized, beaten and forced back to Myanmar, which they had left to escape persecution and abuse and which does not want them.\n \u201cOver the last few months we have treated victims of violence, people who claim to have been beaten by the police, claim to have been beaten by members of the host population, by people they\u2019ve been living next to for many years,\u201d said Paul Critchley, who runs the Bangladesh program for the aid group M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, also known as Doctors Without Borders.\n \u201cWe have treated patients for beatings, for machete wounds and for rape,\u201d he said, quoting a report issued Thursday that describes the situation as a humanitarian crisis. Some had escaped after being forced into a river that forms the border with Myanmar, formerly Burma. \u201cThis is continuing today.\u201d\n Since October, he said, the unofficial Kutupalong makeshift camp with its dirt paths, flimsy shacks and open sewers has grown by 6,000 people to nearly 30,000, with 2,000 arrivals in January alone.\n They are among about 250,000 Rohingya in Bangladesh, a Muslim minority from neighboring Myanmar, where they do not have citizenship and are subject to abuse and forced labor, and where they cannot travel, marry or practice their religion freely.\n Despite the hardships, people are continuing to flee repression and fear in Myanmar, and when they are deported, many return, several people said.\n About 28,000 of them have been recognized by Bangladesh and documented as refugees. They receive food and other assistance in a camp administered by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and have not been subject to the abuses and forced returns described by other Rohingya, said Kitty McKinsey, a spokeswoman for the agency in Bangkok.\n The government has not allowed the agency to register new arrivals since 1993.\n Most Rohingya in Bangladesh have no documentation and struggle to survive, evading the authorities and working mostly as day laborers, servants or pedicab drivers. They have no rights to education or other government services.\n \u201cThey cannot receive general food distribution,\u201d Mr. Critchley said. \u201cIt is illegal for them to work. All they can legally do in Bangladesh is starve to death.\u201d\n The current crackdown is the worst they have ever suffered, according to aid workers and the refugees themselves.\n \u201cOver the last month and in Cox\u2019s Bazaar District alone, hundreds of unregistered Rohingyas have been arrested, either pushed back across the border to Burma or sent to jail under immigration charges,\u201d said Chris Lewa, who closely follows the fate of the Rohingya as director of the Arakan Project, which also issued a report last week.\n \u201cIn several areas of the district, thousands were evicted with threats of violence,\u201d she said. \u201cRobberies, assaults and rape against Rohingyas have significantly increased.\u201d \n A risky route to a better life, by sea to Thailand and then to Malaysia for work, was cut off after the Thai Navy pushed about 1,000 Rohingya boat people out to sea last year to drift and possibly to drown.\n More than a year later, more than 300 are known to be missing and more than 30 are confirmed to have died, Ms. Lewa said. No boats are reported to have landed in Thailand in the recent post-monsoon sailing season.\n \u201cThe brutal push-backs and the continuous detention of the survivors seems to have stopped the Rohingya from doing it again,\u201d Ms. Lewa said. \u201cThat horrible action has had the effect of basically stopping people from leaving.\u201d\n In Bangladesh, the situation in the unofficial camp is becoming desperate, aid workers and refugees said.\n\u201cWe cannot move around to find work,\u201d said Hasan, 40, a day laborer who lives with his wife and three children in a dirt-floored hovel made of sticks, scrap wood and plastic sheeting. He said he had no way to feed his family.\n\u201cThere is a checkpoint nearby where they\u2019re catching people and arresting them,\u201d he told a photographer who visited recently. Like other refugees here, he asked that his last name not be used for fear of reprisals.\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t receiving any help,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one can borrow money from each other. Everybody\u2019s in crisis now.\u201d People do what they can to survive.\n\u201cWhen I visit the camp,\u201d Mr. Critchley said, \u201cI see small girls going out in the forest to collect firewood, and we have treated young girls and women who have been raped doing this.\u201d\nIn its report, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res said that a year ago 90 percent of the people in the makeshift camp were already running out of food.\n\u201cMalnutrition and mortality rates were past emergency thresholds, and people had little access to safe drinking water, sanitation or medical care,\u201d the report said.\n The overcrowded camp has become an incubator for disease, Mr. Critchley said, and with the monsoon season peaking in late March and early April, medical workers fear a lethal spread of acute diarrhea.\n \u201cInternational standards would assume that a latrine is shared by 20 people,\u201d Mr. Critchley said. \u201cWith the number of latrines in the camp, over 70 people share each latrine. I\u2019ve seen small children using piles of human feces as toys.\u201d\nThe Rohingya know that they live at the very bottom of human society, that they are not wanted anywhere and that they are outsiders without legal standing or protection.\nAbdul, 69, who has lived in Bangladesh for more than 15 years, said that those thoughts disturbed his dreams.\n\u201cWhen I sleep I think that if someone kills an animal in the forest they are breaking the law,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are caught and punished. But as human beings it isn\u2019t the same for us. So where are our rights? I think to myself that we are lower than an animal.\u201d",

    "text": "Bangladesh Factory Fire Kills at Least 20\n2010-12-14T14:43:55.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u0097 A fire at a garment factory north of Dhaka, the capital, killed at least 20 people and injured dozens on Tuesday, in the latest blow to the country\u2019s largest industry.\nThe fire at a 10-story factory in the Ashulia industrial area, about 16 miles from the capital, started on the ninth floor around lunchtime, when most of the workers were outside. Local reporters who had canvassed hospitals said at least 24 people had been killed. Factory officials said they knew of about 20 deaths.\nAbout 5,000 people worked in the building, producing pants for customers in the United States and Europe, said Delwar Hussain, a deputy managing director at the Ha-Meem Group, which owns the factory. Fire officials were still fighting the fire, which spread to the top floor, into the evening as people gathered at the compound to look for relatives.\nIt was not immediately clear which Western retailers were supplied by the factory. Garment factories employ about three million Bangladeshis, most of them women, to make clothes for stores like Wal-Mart and H & M. \nJust days ago, three people were killed in labor protests. Workers have said they were protesting because some factories had not carried out a government-mandated 80 percent increase in the minimum wage, to 3,000 taka a month or about $43. \nIt was unclear what had caused the fire at the Ha-Meem factory and whether it was related to the labor unrest. Mr. Hussain said that the company suspected an electrical short circuit, but that investigators from the government and the garment industry association were still working to establish the cause.\nPiles of clothes in garment factories are easily combustible. Fires can be very deadly because some factory owners lock exits to prevent workers from leaving their machines. Mr. Hussain said the doors at the company\u2019s factory had not been locked.\nInternational labor groups have criticized the safety of Bangladesh\u2019s garment factories. A factory fire outside Dhaka in February killed more than 20 people.\nThe Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association said it would pay the families of workers killed in the Ha-Meem fire 100,000 taka (about $1,400), and the company has promised to pay another 100,000 taka.\nMr. Hussain said the company hoped to reopen the first eight floors of the factory as early as Tuesday because they did not appear to be damaged. He said the company expected to meet all pending orders. The ninth floor was used as a finishing area where workers prepared shipments, and the 10th floor housed a dining hall, he said.",

    "text": "Hungry Population Falls but Remains Large\n2010-09-14T17:20:48.000Z\nUNITED NATIONS \u0097 The number of undernourished people in the world decreased this year for the first time in 15 years, but the level remains higher than before the 2008 food crisis, and the volatile state of prices gives cause for unease, senior United Nations officials said Tuesday. \n The number of hungry people fell to 925 million from the record high of 1.02 billion in 2009, with much of the improvement tied to income growth in the Asia-Pacific region and to a 40 percent drop in food prices from their 2008 peak. \nStill, the hunger number remains \u201cshockingly high,\u201d said Josette Sheeran, the executive director of the World Food Program, at a news conference in Rome, especially since success stories in African, Asian and Latin American countries that once suffered chronic malnourishment suggest that a permanent reversal should be possible. \nThe figures were compiled before the flooding crisis in Pakistan and the jolt in wheat prices in late August, the second in the month, after Russia announced that it would halt wheat exports because of drought and fires. \nThe numbers in the latest hunger report were released before a meeting next week at the United Nations in New York of more than 100 world leaders, who will consider the fate of eight development goals set in 2000 for 2015, with many of them well short of the targets. \nThe latest hunger data indicate that the very first goal, reducing the number of hungry people in the world to half of what it was in 1990, will be virtually impossible to meet, Jacques Diouf, the director general of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, said at the news conference, which was broadcast on the Web. \nThe report estimated that the number of undernourished people in the Asia-Pacific region would decline 12 percent from 2009, to 578 million, because of economic growth there. Seven countries account for two-thirds of the world\u2019s hungry people: China, India, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Ethiopia and Pakistan. India and China alone account for 40 percent of the world\u2019s hungry, the report said. \nBut sub-Saharan Africa has the highest proportion of undernourished people, 30 percent of its population, it said.\n\u201cThe current dramatic situation is a result of the neglect of agriculture in development policies over the past three decades,\u201d Mr. Diouf said. More than 70 percent of the extremely poor live in rural parts of developing countries, he said, and those areas need investment in seeds and fertilizer and better access to markets to reduce hunger.\nThe world\u2019s 20 most developed countries promised to invest $22 billion in aid to agriculture from 2009 to 2011, he noted, but so far only $425 million has been spent. While all the movement in terms of aid is in the right direction, he said, the pace needs to be accelerated. \nOxfam International, a group of antipoverty organizations, released a report on Tuesday saying that it estimated that an increase in investment of $75 billion a year was needed \u0097 half in overseas aid and half from developing countries\u2019 national budgets \u0097 to reach the target of halving the number of hungry people. \nOxfam\u2019s report said that the factors contributing to the 2008 food crisis, including biofuels investments, commodity speculation and stagnant productivity in sub-Saharan Africa, still exist and that another food crisis may happen.\nThe situation is very different in that the cereal harvest this year will be the third largest on record, Mr. Diouf said. There has also been a bumper crop of rice. Still, the turbulence in prices over the past two years, which contributed to riots partly over food in Mozambique last month, is likely a sign that volatility will increase in the future. \u201cIf it persists, it will create an additional obstacle to reduce hunger,\u201d he said.

    "text": "Bangladesh, With Low Pay, Moves In on China\n2010-07-16T23:23:52.000Z\nGAZIPUR, Bangladesh \u0097 The eight-lane highway leading from the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, narrows repeatedly as it approaches this town about 30 miles north, eventually depositing cars onto a muddy, potholed lane bordered by mangroves and small shops. \nBut this is no mere rural backwater. It is the sort of place to which foreign manufacturers may increasingly turn, if the rising wage demands of factory workers in China prompt companies to seek new pools of cheap labor elsewhere. \nAlready, in factories behind steel gates and tall concrete walls, tens of thousands of workers, most of them women, spend their days stitching T-shirts, pants and sweaters for Wal-Mart, H&M, Zara and other Western retailers and brands.\nOne of the Bangladeshi companies here, the DBL Group, employs 9,000 people making T-shirts and other knitwear. Business has been so good that the company is finishing a new 10-story building with open floors the size of soccer fields, planted with row after row of sewing machines.\n\u201cOur family needed the money, so we came here,\u201d said Maasuda Akthar, a 21-year-old sewing machine operator for DBL. \nAs costs have risen in China, long the world\u2019s shop floor, it is slowly losing work to countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia \u0097 at least for cheaper, labor-intensive goods like casual clothes, toys and simple electronics that do not necessarily require literate workers and can tolerate unreliable transportation systems and electrical grids. \nLi & Fung, a Hong Kong company that handles sourcing and apparel manufacturing for companies like Wal-Mart and Liz Claiborne, reported that its production in Bangladesh jumped 20 percent last year, while China, its biggest supplier, slid 5 percent. \n\u201cBangladesh is getting very competitive,\u201d William Fung, Li & Fung\u2019s group managing director, told analysts in March. \nThe flow of jobs to poorer countries like Bangladesh started even before recent labor unrest in China led to big pay raises for many factory workers there \u0097 and before changes in Beijing\u2019s currency policy that could also raise the costs of Chinese exports. Now, though, economists expect the migration of China\u2019s low-paying jobs to accelerate. \nAnd while workers in Bangladesh and other developing countries are demanding higher pay, too \u0097 leading to a clash between police and protesters earlier this week in a garment hub outside Dhaka \u0097 they still earn much less than Chinese factory workers. \nBangladesh, for instance, has the lowest garment wages in the world, according to labor rights advocates. Ms. Akthar, who is relatively well paid by local standards, earns about $64 a month. That compares to minimum wages in China\u2019s coastal industrial provinces ranging from $117 to $147 a month.\n\u201cThe Chinese firms that are beginning to get into trouble are producing textiles, rubber footwear and things like that,\u201d said Barry Eichengreen, a professor of economics and political science at the University of California. \u201cAnd there are lots of countries in South Asia and East Asia and in Central America that would like to fill this space.\u201d\nBut Bangladesh has its own challenges to overcome.\nChina\u2019s combination of a vast population of migrant workers, many with at least elementary school educations, along with modern roads, railways and power grids in its industrial provinces, has bestowed it with manufacturing capabilities that countries like Bangladesh cannot offer. Beijing also provides low-cost loans and other incentives to its industries that other countries have trouble matching for theirs. \nMost of Bangladesh, meanwhile, suffers blackouts six to seven hours a day because it has not invested enough in power plants and natural gas fields \u0097 deficiencies that the government is working on but that will not be eliminated quickly.\nThe country has a literacy rate of only 55 percent \u0097 compared with more than 92 percent in China. As a result, workers in this country are only one-fourth as productive as the Chinese in making shirts, jackets and other woven clothes, according to a report by the Center for Policy Dialogue, an independent research organization based in Dhaka. \nDespite its handicaps, Bangladesh nearly doubled garment exports from 2004 to 2009. And the industry now employs about three million people, more than any other industrial segment in this largely agrarian country of 160 million. From June through November last year, garment exports accounted for more than 80 percent of the country\u2019s total exports of $7.1 billion.  \nAmong developing countries, Bangladesh is the third-biggest exporter of clothing after mainland China, which exported $120 billion in 2008, and Turkey, a distant No. 2, according to the World Trade Organization.\nAnd with nearly 70 million people of working age, Bangladesh could probably absorb many more of China\u2019s 20 million garment industry jobs.\nStill, some of the changes in China could prove to be mixed blessings for Bangladesh. If China allows its currency, the renminbi, to trade more freely, Bangladeshi exports would become more competitive. \nBut a stronger renminbi could also hurt Bangladesh by raising the price of machinery and fabric imported from China, its biggest supplier, said Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak, an assistant professor of economics at the Yale School of Management. Over time, Bangladesh could buy more from other countries, like India, but those countries first would need to build up significant production capacity.\nAnd as in China, workers in Bangladesh have started demanding higher pay. In recent weeks, labor protests have periodically shut down garment factories as thousands of workers battled police in Dhaka and other garment hubs like Gazipur. Late last month, police clashed with about 15,000 protesters on a busy Dhaka street lined with garment factories. In one exchange, a clutch of protesters lobbed bricks at police officers from an alley opposite the Outright Fashion factory, before fleeing as the officers charged at them with batons, tear gas canisters and the hot, colored water used to both disperse protesters and mark them for later identification. \nGarment workers are demanding a 200 percent increase in the minimum wage, to 5,000 taka (about $71) a month \u0097 which is how much workers with several years of experience now earn. The government, which plans to announce a new minimum wage soon, last increased it in 2006, to 1,662.50 taka (about $24). Since then, inflation has been as high as 9.9 percent a year.\n\u201cMost garment workers live in slum areas where one room costs 2,000 to 3,000 taka,\u201d said Mushrefa Mishu, president of the Garment Workers\u2019 Unity Forum, an association that claims to represent more than 60,000 members. \n Labor leaders want the government to make it easier for workers to form unions \u0097 very few factories are unionized today \u0097 and to require higher safety standards and better working conditions. \nIn January, H&M, Wal-Mart, Gap, Tesco and other Western clothing buyers asked the Bangladeshi government to raise the minimum wage and reset it every year, although the group did not specify what the wage should be. A spokeswoman for H&M, Malin Bjorne, said the company was willing to pay more for clothing to help support higher wages. It is unclear whether other companies would do the same.\nBut factory owners here argue that a big increase in wages would make them uncompetitive against Vietnam and other big producers, which have higher labor costs but also have better infrastructure and are more efficient producers. If that happened, Bangladesh\u2019s China opportunity could prove all too fleeting, they say.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s 5,000 taka, I would close all my factories,\u201d said Anisul Huq, a former head of the Bangladeshi garment industry\u2019s trade group and a factory owner whose customers include H&M and Wal-Mart. \u201cEven if it\u2019s 3,000 taka, lots of factories will close within three or four months.\u201d",

    "text": "Warming Is Real. Now What?\n2010-08-02T18:08:39.000Z\nEven as Democrats abandoned efforts late last month to advance a major climate change bill through the Senate, books about global warming continue to pour forth. Two of the more interesting ones do not waste time rearguing debates over the science (in 2007 a United Nations panel, synthesizing the work of hundreds of climatologists from around the world, called evidence for global warming \u201cunequivocal\u201d), but instead take as a starting point the clear and present dangers posed by the greenhouse gases produced by burning fossil fuels. \n\u201cThe Climate War,\u201d by Eric Pooley \u0097 deputy editor of Bloomberg BusinessWeek and former managing editor of Fortune \u0097 looks at the hotly contested politics of global warming, especially as it\u2019s been played out in Washington over the last three years. \u201cThe Weather of the Future,\u201d by Heidi Cullen \u0097 a senior research scientist with Climate Central, a nonprofit research organization \u0097 offers a scorching vision of what life might be like in the warmer world that is already on its way.\nAlthough \u201cWeather of the Future\u201d sounds like an exercise in speculation, Ms. Cullen grounds her harrowing predictions \u0097 extrapolations, really \u0097 in \u201cthe best available science\u201d derived from an array of climate models, environmental data and interviews with scientists. And her forecasts actually turn out to be an armature for discussing the fallout of climate change (from rising sea levels to more extreme weather) in an accessible, tactile fashion and for examining existing liabilities in various regions and cities, like overstretched infrastructure and dwindling water supplies.\nIn what will come as little surprise to Americans suffering through this summer\u2019s persistent heat waves, Ms. Cullen notes that the average annual temperature in the United States \u201chas risen more than two degrees F during the past 50 years, and the temperature will continue to rise, depending on the amount of heat-trapping gases we emit globally.\u201d \nBy 2050, with midrange emissions, she writes, \u201ca day so hot that it is currently experienced only once every 20 years would occur every three years over much of the continental United States\u201d; and by the end the century, \u201csuch a day would occur every other year, or more often.\u201d\nBecause a warmer climate means more evaporation of water from land and oceans, Ms. Cullen observes, it also results \u201cin longer and more severe droughts in some areas and more flooding in others.\u201d And because a warmer world means the continued melting of glaciers and polar ice, it leads to rising sea levels \u0097 which threaten places prone to flooding, as well as places vulnerable to sea surges during hurricanes. \nIn the case of New York City, hotter summers lead to a heavier reliance on air-conditioning, which leads to more stress on an already strained electrical grid. Also at risk, says Rae Zimmerman, a member of the New York City Panel on Climate Change, is much of the city\u2019s critical infrastructure, which sits less than 10 feet above sea level, including the New York entrance to the Holland Tunnel (at 9.5 feet above sea level) and La Guardia Airport (at 6.8 feet above sea level).\nAs for the Central Valley in California, which is the hub of that state\u2019s water supply system, providing water for two out of three Californians, it is vulnerable to the catastrophic failure of its canals and levees, whether from an earthquake or the slowly rising sea level \u0097 much the way New Orleans was vulnerable to flooding during Hurricane Katrina. Ms. Cullen adds that global warming is also likely to affect the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada, which is the \u201ctrue basis of California\u2019s water system,\u201d just as it is likely to lead to \u201chotter wildfires that are harder to control.\u201d \nIn many parts of the world climate change will have serious geopolitical fallout as well. Droughts and floods in Bangladesh, Ms. Cullen says, could result in more and more climate refugees, even as a growing scarcity of groundwater in northern India could further exacerbate tensions between India and Pakistan. National security experts, she writes, see climate change as a \u201cthreat multiplier,\u201d leading to increased tensions between rich and poor nations, and amplifying regional political disputes over access to water and food in times of drought (as has happened, for instance, in Darfur).\nAlthough there were hopes that last year\u2019s United Nations talks in Copenhagen would lead to an important accord on climate change, the final document to come out of the summit was a statement of intention, not a binding pledge, to begin taking action on global warming. In the view of many scientists and politicians, the disappointing outcome stemmed partly from the failure of the United States Senate to pass legislation intended to cap American emissions before the summit \u0097 which, in turn, meant that China would not agree to an absolute reduction of its emissions. \nIn \u201cThe Climate War,\u201d which ends with the Copenhagen summit, Mr. Pooley gives us a detailed, if sometimes longwinded, account of the political battle to get Congress to take legislative action on global warming. It is a depressing account of gridlock in Washington, of efforts by conservative lobbyists to deny the phenomenon altogether (and when that hasn\u2019t worked, to delay any sort of action), and of infighting within the environmental left over whether to compromise and try to get the support of centrists and corporate interests, or whether to take a hard-line, ideological stand. It is a story about how the economic meltdown of 2008 and the ensuing recession \u0097 and concerns about job losses and other short-term costs of establishing a clean-energy economy \u0097 affected the debate over global warming and the political arithmetic that members of Congress and the Obama administration have been doing over the viability of climate change legislation.\nMr. Pooley tells this story by focusing on a couple of key people: most notably, former Vice President Al Gore, the public face of the antiglobal warming crusade; Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund, who \u201coften forged partnerships with industry and pushed for agreements that the left couldn\u2019t stand\u201d; and Mr. Krupp\u2019s sometime ally Jim Rogers, chief executive of Duke Energy, who joined other business executives and the leaders of several national environmental groups to form the United States Climate Action Partnership, an organization calling for an economywide solution to global warming and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn these pages Mr. Pooley deftly explicates the political maneuvering surrounding the controversial concept of \u201ccap and trade\u201d (a mandatory and declining limit on carbon emissions, combined with a system of tradable emissions permits) and does a suspenseful job of recounting the walk-up to last year\u2019s extremely close vote in the House (219 to 212), passing a climate change bill. Because Senate Democrats decided only two weeks ago (long after this book went to press) that they did not have the votes to pass a broad energy bill including a cap on greenhouse gas emissions, Mr. Pooley\u2019s book ends on an unfinished, cliffhanger note.\n\u201cIn their least guarded moments,\u201d Mr. Pooley writes, \u201cthe climate campaigners would tell you what they had always known in their bones: their work was necessary but not sufficient. Climate action was going to happen sooner or later, but they couldn\u2019t make it happen. It might be inevitable \u0097 the true believers still believed it was \u0097 but it would only become real when enough people demanded it and shouted down the lobbyists and the professional deniers and demanded it again. Alexis de Tocqueville long ago said that in the United States, events \u2018can move from the impossible to the inevitable without ever stopping at the probable.\u2019 Was that still true? How bad did things need to get before the moment came? Would the prospect of a clean-energy economy, and the jobs it would bring, mobilize enough people to make a difference? Or would some sort of monstrous, galvanic weather event \u0097 epic heat and drought, Katrina on steroids \u0097 be needed to shake America fully awake?\u201d ",

    "text": "Cotton Clothing Price Tags to Rise\n2010-11-03T00:15:56.000Z\nSynthetic linings. Smaller buttons. Less Italian fabric. And yes, even more polyester. Unusually high cotton prices have apparel makers scrambling to keep down costs, but consumers be warned: cotton clothing will be getting more expensive. \n\u201cIt\u2019s really a no-choice situation,\u201d said Wesley R. Card, president and chief executive of the Jones Group, the company behind Anne Klein, Nine West and other brands. \u201cPrices have to come up.\u201d \nThe Bon-Ton chain is raising prices on its private-label fashion items by as much as a dollar this spring, and prices will go up further next fall. And it is switching from 100 percent cotton in items like sweaters to more acrylic blends. Levi\u2019s says it has already increased prices and may push them further north next year. And Hanesbrands, the maker of Champion, Hanes and Playtex, says price increases will be in place by February, and prices could go up further if cotton prices remain where they are.\nOther apparel makers say they have held the line on prices this year, but next year will be different. The V. F. Corporation, the maker of 7 for All Mankind and The North Face, says most brands will probably cost more next year, and its cotton-heavy jeans lines are particularly susceptible to increases. Jones says its increases could be in the high single digits or more. \nThe problem is a classic supply and demand imbalance, with the price of cotton rising almost 80 percent since July and prices expected to remain high. \u201cWorld cotton production is unlikely to catch up with consumption for at least two years,\u201d said Sharon Johnson, senior cotton analyst with the First Capital Group, in an e-mail.\nCotton inventories had been low because of weak demand during the recession. This summer, new cotton crops were also depleted because of flooding in Pakistan and bad weather in China and India, all major cotton producers.\n But demand from China, in particular, was rising. And as the economic recovery in the United States began, apparel makers and retailers placed orders for more inventory, spurring even more demand. As prices rose, speculators entered the market, driving prices even higher. \n\u201cSo far, it has shocked even the most veteran traders,\u201d said Mike Stevens, an independent cotton analyst in Mandeville, La., in an e-mail. \u201cIt has resulted in panic buying by mills worldwide in order to ensure that they can keep their doors open.\u201d\nAs of Tuesday morning, the price of cotton (measured by cotton futures for December delivery) had hit a record high on worries that cold weather in China might have damaged some crops. \nCotton\u2019s swooping increase has some apparel companies switching production to countries with lower labor costs or milder customs charges. Lululemon Athletica, the sportswear company, is moving some manufacturing from China to Vietnam, Cambodia and Bangladesh, where wages are lower, and Bon-Ton is benefiting from reduced-duty production in Egypt and Nicaragua.\nManufacturers are also thinking smaller, examining whether a button or a thread can be replaced with a cheaper one, or whether the overall material mix can be changed so it is not so cotton heavy.\n\u201cThey are taking purchase orders from the retailer and having this conversation with them, saying, \u2018Look, I can\u2019t deliver this garment for a dollar this year when it cost me a dollar twenty-five to make it up,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Andrew Tananbaum, the chief executive of Capital Business Credit, which finances apparel makers and other importers. \u201c\u00a0\u2018So would you take this garment if it had not cotton but acrylic?\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nMr. Card, of the Jones Group, said the company had \u201cwhole teams\u201d looking for more cost-effective materials that did not reduce quality. \u201cThat\u2019s all they do,\u201d Mr. Card said.\nLiz Claiborne, which makes brands like Juicy Couture and Kate Spade, said it is also playing with some of the materials it uses. One example, said Jane Randel, a spokeswoman, would be shifting from some imported Italian fabrics to \u201csuppliers who produce their own raw materials or yarns.\u201d The company may also reassess its contracts for so-called component materials \u0097 like buttons and trims \u0097 she said in an e-mail.\nAt Bon-Ton, retail prices for the private-label clothes have increased about 5 to 8 percent so far this year, said Steve Villa, senior vice president of private brand at the company. Bon-Ton has been turning to different formulations, including sweaters blended with different rayons and synthetic fibers, to avoid further increases. \n\u201cAt some point, you adopt a different process that maybe will yield some cost savings or you are faced with passing that through,\u201d Mr. Villa said.\nOf course, as apparel makers increase the price of cotton goods and also try to reduce their reliance on cotton, there are some risks.\nFor starters, neither the apparel makers nor the retailers are certain that shoppers will be willing to pay more for cotton goods. \u201cIt\u2019s an unanswered question at this point,\u201d said Robert K. Shearer, chief financial officer of the V. F. Corporation.\nAnd \u0097 to the disfavor of many fashion purists \u0097 with prices unlikely to fall for some time, there could be wider popular acceptance of fabrics like polyester.\n\u201cWe may be training a new generation to be far more accepting of synthetic fibers, which is likely to hurt cotton\u2019s market share in the long run,\u201d said Ms. Johnson, the analyst with the First Capital Group.",

    "text": "\u2018We Wail With You, Haiti\u2019\n2010-02-27T02:00:00.000Z\nON Jan. 13, the day after the earthquake that upended Haiti, Garry Pierre-Pierre, editor and publisher of The Haitian Times, moved the center of operations for his weekly newspaper from Brooklyn to a tent in the backyard of a damaged apartment building in Port-au-Prince. If he was going to cover one of the most transformative events in the history of the country and its diaspora, he knew there was only one place for him to be.\n\u201cThe human factor is sometimes missing in stories about faraway places,\u201d said Mr. Pierre-Pierre, who has since published a steady stream of articles that provided an intimate and sensitive portrayal of events on the ground. \u201cI knew if I didn\u2019t go, we also would not have provided it.\u201d\nMr. Pierre-Pierre and his colleagues at The Times have written a portrait of one street in Port-au-Prince and its survivors, for example, and another article about the challenges faced by a team of doctors, including some Haitian-Americans, from New York.\nIn another report, in the Jan. 20-26 issue, the paper detailed the desperate exodus of Haitians from the capital, including a mother with two small children, one of whom had a heart ailment, and a metal worker anxious both to let his mother know that he had survived and to get back to work.\nIt is no surprise that The Times and New York\u2019s three other weekly Haitian newspapers, Haiti Libert\u00e9, Haiti Observateur and Haiti Progres, have been dominated by stories about the disaster.\nBut many of the hundreds of other ethnic newspapers in New York \u2014 like the daily Novoye Russkoye Slovo, a Russian paper, and El Tiempo de New York, a Hispanic weekly \u2014 have run stories revealing particular perspectives on the earthquake and its aftermath.\nThe weekly Peruanisimo News, for example, reported on a fund-raiser for Haiti in Paterson, N.J. The fund-raiser was organized by Peruvians, and Paterson is a stronghold of the Peruvian population in the region.\nThe New York Carib News wrote about post-earthquake psychological counseling for Caribbean vendors on Flatbush Avenue, supplied by a Brooklyn hospital and a Caribbean-American business group. And Thikana, a Bangladeshi weekly based in Long Island City, Queens, exhorted Bangladeshis in the United States and elsewhere in the world to donate generously to relief efforts.\nHere are excerpts from local Albanian, Chinese and Filipino newspapers.\n\u2022\nHaiti in Our Minds\nA wail is a type of sound any human being would find difficulty hearing. It is not borne out of emotional stress, but rather of grieving souls and broken spirits. As of this writing, there is constant wailing in Haiti. A catastrophic earthquake struck the capital three days ago, destroying almost every edifice and burying about 100,000 people to their untimely deaths. It is a disaster of unimaginable proportion and could certainly cause a grave humanitarian crisis...\nThere are reports that Filipinos that are members of the United Nations peacekeeping team are among those trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings. The Philippine ambassador to the U.N., Hilario Davide, said that all Filipinos in the team are accounted for. This is a time when we all become one in grief with our fellow human beings. This is a time when nationalities cease to exist. This a time when we must do whatever we can to send help to those affected by the killer quake. We Filipinos are not strangers to this situation. In September of 2009, we ourselves were devastated when Typhoon Ondoy struck our capital. The world came together to aid us in those dark times. Now is our chance to reciprocate the good will that we received...\nHaiti may be across the oceans, but we are all human beings, and we share their pain. We wail with you, Haiti.\n\u2014TED REYES, Jan. 18\nThe Filipino Express, based in Jersey City, has a weekly circulation of 35,000.\n\u2022\nFate of Hundreds of Smuggled Chinese Unknown\nIn recent years, Haiti has become an important junction for smuggled Chinese on their way to the United States. As a result of the heavy casualties of the earthquake in the region, the status of hundreds of smuggled Chinese waiting to go to the United States is uncertain...\nChen, a Fujian family association administrator, said that there are some smuggled ethnic Chinese that have been hidden inside Haitian residences through arrangements made by snakeheads, that these smuggled Chinese would not in any way be registered with the local government and that for this reason they could be easily overlooked during any rescue attempt. Fujian family associations in New York are calling on the Haitian government, Chinese peacekeeping forces and international rescue teams to look into the safety of the smuggled Chinese. An overseas Chinese community leader revealed that a woman from Changle had called New York asking for help in inquiring about the whereabouts of her son in Haiti. She said, \"It's enough that he's alive. Whether or not he makes it to the United States is not important.\"\n\u2014CAO JIAN, Jan. 14\nTranslation from Mandarin by Jeffrey E. Singer\nThe World Journal, founded in 1976, is the largest Chinese-language newspaper in North America, with a circulation of 300,000. Its New York headquarters are in Whitestone, Queens. \n\u2022\nFamous Famiglia Donates $12,000 for the Victims in Haiti\nThis horror of catastrophic dimensions hit hard Pierre Louis, the Haitian immigrant who lost six members of his family in this national tragedy. This loss touched even more personally the owners of Famous Famiglia, the Kolaj brothers (Paul, George, John and Tony), as well as the brothers Idrizi, employers of Pierre Louis, here in New York City. They organized a candlelight vigil in one of their restaurants accompanied with an initiative to help Pierre Louis and his people. The young voices of the Harlem Choir were invited to perform several songs. An all-day fund-raiser was launched in the restaurant, which is situated in Midtown Manhattan, with all the proceeds of the day, about $12,000, going to a humanitarian relief fund dedicated to help Haiti. A representative of the American Red Cross Haiti Relief Fund thanked the owners of Famous Famiglia for their generosity in these hard times for the people of Haiti. It is worth remembering that the Kolaj brothers, who are ethnic Albanians, were involved also in the fund-raising campaign held a few days earlier to help the flooding victims in the area of Shkodra, in northern Albania.\n\u2014HALIL MULA, Jan. 22\nTranslation by Ruben Avxhiu\nIllyria, published twice a week, is an Albanian-language newspaper with a circulation of 10,000 and has offices in Manhattan.",

    "text": "2011 Shaping Up as One Long Corridor of Uncertainty for Pakistan\n2010-12-30T20:24:11.000Z\nAs a dismal year draws to a close, Pakistani cricket fans may be hoping that 2011 will bring a little respite from the torrent of bad news that has engulfed their national team.\nThe lesson of Pakistan\u2019s recent cricket history, though, is that however bad things may seem to be, there is often worse to come. \nThe start of 2011 certainly promises to be pretty grim, with the first half of January bringing a succession of events that will underline Pakistan\u2019s current misfortunes.\nMost attention will be devoted to the appearance of three of its leading players before an International Cricket Council tribunal. Starting Thursday, the tribunal in Doha, Qatar, will spend six days attempting to determine whether there is any truth to the spot-fixing allegations made against the former Pakistani captain Salman Butt and the fast bowlers Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir by The News of the World, a British newspaper.\nThe last Sunday of August, when the allegations were published as Pakistan was playing England at Lord\u2019s, was when any hopes that 2010 might turn out well for Pakistani cricket were extinguished. \nThe national team had been forced to play in exile because of the security situation at home, had gone through a couple more rotations on its carousel of captains and had lost the World Twenty20 title it won in England the previous year. Worst of all, the players had heard the news of the devastating floods back in Pakistan.\nAmid this darkness, there were a few points of light \u2014 the fortunate emergence of Butt as a brightly impressive young leader and the brilliant bowling of Asif and, in particular, the 18-year-old Amir, who was establishing a serious claim to be the best teenage cricketer ever.\nThat the fixing claims struck down these three encouraging players seemed the cruelest of blows, even by Pakistani standards. \nThe sense of dismay that Amir, a symbol of hope and renewal, was implicated spread well beyond Pakistan. The former England captain Nasser Hussain spoke for many when he said that his immediate reaction to hearing that there were accusations against Pakistani players had been to wish that it was \u201canybody but the kid.\u201d\nButt, speaking to Sky News earlier this month, said, \u201cI believe, inshallah, that I will be back and playing for my country again.\u201d \nThe panel will be chaired by the senior British barrister Michael Beloff, sitting with the Kenyan lawyer Sharad Rao and Albie Sachs, who recently retired as a judge on the Constitutional Court of South Africa. Its decisions may not, though, conclude the process.\nEven if the players are cleared, they could still face criminal charges from a British police investigation. Butt unsuccessfully sought to have the Doha tribunal postponed until after the British investigators had reported.\nIf the Doha tribunal rules against them, Amir\u2019s lawyer has already indicated that he will appeal to the Court of Sporting Arbitration in Lausanne, Switzerland, citing his client\u2019s youth and previously unblemished record. \nWhile these three have the highest profile among Pakistani players, some of their teammates are also in cricketing limbo. Wicket keeper Zulqarnain Haider made a dramatic debut against England in Birmingham in August. He came close to achieving the rare and unenviable feat of being dismissed first ball twice in a debut match, but a television review spared him that fate. He then went on to play a brilliant second innings that revived his team\u2019s morale, all while his father lay ill back in Pakistan. \nBut three months later, Haider returned to Britain, this time seeking political asylum. He had left the team in Dubai and reported receiving threats following a match-winning innings for Pakistan in a one-day international against Australia. His next interview with the British authorities is scheduled for Wednesday.\nAlso uncertain of their immediate future are Kamran Akmal, Shoaib Malik and Danish Kaneria, who were asked to supply financial details to the Pakistan Cricket Board as a precondition of being considered for the 2011 World Cup, which will take place in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh starting Feb. 19. Pakistan was also to be a co-host, until security fears forced its withdrawal. Other teams filed lists of possible players Dec. 19. The cricket authorities have given Pakistan until Wednesday to clear up its loose ends.\nOne other event in the first few days of 2011 will underline Pakistan\u2019s unhappiness: the player auction for the Indian Premier League in Bangalore on Jan. 8 and 9. The league has released a list of 416 players who will enter the auction. Not one is from Pakistan, making this the third year running in which the country\u2019s players have been excluded from a competition that has made the world\u2019s leading cricketers richer than many could have imagined. \nIt is perhaps no coincidence that allegations of corruption have resurfaced at a time when Pakistan\u2019s players have been kept out of this sporting gold mine. Yet another setback for the cricketing nation where things all too often go from bad to worse.",

(Civilization and anarchy are only seven meals apart.) \u2014Spanish proverb\nDigging into a mountain of caviar, sea urchin roe, succulent Kyoto beef, rare conger eels, truffles, and fine champagne, the leaders of the world\u2019s richest and most powerful countries shook their heads over soaring grocery prices in the developed world and spreading hunger in Africa, India, and Asia. Over an eighteen-course banquet prepared for them by sixty chefs, the eight global potentates declared, \u201cWe are deeply concerned that the steep rise in global food prices coupled with availability problems in a number of developing countries is threatening global food security. The negative impacts of this recent trend could push millions more back into poverty.\u201d\nThis statement, which followed the July 2008 meeting of the G8 (Group of Eight) nations in Hokkaido, Japan, was revelatory in several ways. The leaders of France, the United States, Rus sia, Britain, Germany, Canada, Italy, and Japan seemed bemused by the sudden emergence of the specter of food scarcity after de cades of apparent abundance and cheap prices. This was a problem they clearly thought had been fixed.\nConcealed within their response were embarrassing admissions. First, in urging major increases in global food aid, the leaders appeared to tacitly concede that wealthy countries had failed to fulfill their pledges to the United Nations\u2019 Millennium Development Goals of 2000 to fight poverty. Second, in calling on the world to reverse declining support for agricultural development and research, they were implicitly confessing that they had let these deteriorate. Third, in demanding food security early warning systems, the G8 leaders effectively admitted that they had been caught unawares by the emerging food crisis \u2014 and didn\u2019t like it. There are few things a politician likes less than an unforeseen development, so for good mea sure they backhanded the United Nations Food and Agriculture Or ga ni za tion (FAO), demanding its \u201cthorough reform,\u201d presumably for the sin of having failed to get their attention with its previous warnings.\nThe \u201cBlessings of the Earth and the Sea Social Dinner\u201d for the G8 leaders, hosted by the government of Japan, had more than a touch of the fall of the Roman Empire about it. The eight most powerful men on Earth and their partners regaled themselves on cornbread stuffed with caviar, smoked salmon, and sea urchin roe; hot onion tart and winter lily bulbs followed by kelp-flavored cold Kyoto beef with asparagus dressed with sesame cream; diced fatty tuna flesh with avocado, shiso, and jellied soy sauce; boiled clam, tomato, and shiso in jellied clear soup; water shield and pink conger dressed with a vinegary soy sauce; boiled prawn with jellied tosazu vinegar; grilled eel rolled in burdock; sweet potato; and fried and seasoned goby with soy sauce and sugar. This beginning was followed by a bisque of hairy crab and salt-grilled bighand thornyhead with vinegar-pepper sauce. The main course was poele of milk-fed lamb flavored with aromatic herbs and mustard, as well as roasted lamb with black truffle and pine seed oil sauce. This was followed by a special cheese selection with lavender honey and caramelized nuts, and then a whimsical \u201cG8 fantasy dessert\u201d and coffee with candied fruits and vegetables. The food was accompanied by Le R\u00eave grand cru/La Seule Gloire champagne; a sake wine, Isojiman Junmai Daiginjo Nakadori; Corton-Charlemagne 2005 (France); Ridge California Monte Bello 1997; and Tokaji Esszencia 1999 (Hungary). The cost of holding the G8 summit (five hundred million dollars) could have fed for a week the additional one hundred million people left hungry by the emerging food crisis.\nWith eloquent symbolism, this Petronian banquet made clear that the well-off part of humanity has largely forgotten what it is to go hungry and is awakening to an unpleasant shock: starvation and the wars, refugee crises, and collapse of nation-states that often accompany hunger have not been permanently banished after all. Indeed, they are once more at our doorstep. Food insecurity and its deadly consequences are again a pressing concern for every nation and each individual.\nDespite the global food crisis of 2007\u20138, the coming famine hasn\u2019t happened yet. It is a looming planetary emergency whose interlocked causes and deeper ramifications the world has barely begun to absorb, let alone come to grips with. Experts predict that the crisis will peak by the middle of the twenty-first century; it is arriving even faster than climate change. Yet there is still time to forestall catastrophe.\nThe first foreshocks were discernible soon after the turn of the millennium. In the years from 2001 to 2008 the world steadily consumed more grain that it produced, triggering rising prices, growing shortages, and even rationing and famine in poorer countries. The global stockpile of grain shrank from more than a hundred days\u2019 supply of food to less than fifty days\u2019. It was the difference between a comfortable surplus and alarming shortages in some countries; it was accompanied by soaring prices \u2014 and the resulting fury of ordinary citizens.\nIt was mainly this simple fact of each year consuming slightly more than we grew that panicked the long-quiescent grain markets, triggering a cycle of price increases that sent shockwaves through consumers in all countries, governments, and global institutions such as the United Nations, its FAO, and the World Bank. All of a sudden food security, having been off the po liti cal menu for de cades, was heading the bill of fare \u2014 not even to be entirely eclipsed by the spectacular crash of the world\u2019s financial markets that followed soon afterward.\nThat the world was suddenly short of food \u2014 after almost a half century of abundance, extravagant variety, year-round availability, and the cheapest real food prices enjoyed by many consumers in the whole of human history \u2014 seemed unimaginable. On tele vi sion celebrity chefs extolled the virtue of devouring animals and plants increasingly rare in the wild; magazines larded their pages with mouth-watering recipes to tempt their overfed readers\u2019 jaded appetites; food corporations churned out novel concoctions of salt, sugar, fat, emulsifier, extender, and dye; fast-food outlets disgorged floods of dubious nutrition to fatten an already overweight 1.4 billion people. And, in the third world, nearly fifteen thousand children continued to die quietly and painfully each day from hunger-related disease.\n\u201cA brutal convergence of events has hit an unprepared global market, and grain prices are sky high. The world\u2019s poor suffer most,\u201d stated the Washington Post. \u201cThe food price shock now roiling world markets is destabilizing governments, igniting street riots and threatening to send a new wave of hunger rippling through the world\u2019s poorest nations. It is outpacing even the Soviet grain emergency of 1972\u201375, when world food prices rose 78 percent.\u201d Between 2005 and 2008 food prices rose on average by 80 percent, according to the FAO.\n\u201cRocketing food prices \u2014 some of which have more than doubled in two years \u2014 have sparked riots in numerous countries recently,\u201d Time magazine reported. \u201cMillions are reeling . . . and governments are scrambling to staunch a fast-moving crisis before it spins out of control. From Mexico to Pakistan, protests have turned violent.\u201d Time attributed events to booming demand from newly affluent Chinese and Indian consumers, freak weather events that had reduced harvests, the spike in oil prices, and growth in the production of farm biofuels.\nIn early 2007, thousands of Mexicans turned out on the streets in protest over the \u201ctortilla crisis\u201d \u2014 savage increases in the cost of maize flour. Over the ensuing months food riots or public unrest over food prices were reported by media in Haiti, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Bangladesh, India, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Cameroon, Morocco, Mauritania, Somalia, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Kenya, Egypt, Ivory Coast, Yemen, the United Arab Emirates, Mexico, and Zimbabwe. In Haiti riots forced the resignation of the prime minister and obliged the United Nations World Food Programme to provide emergency aid to 2.3 million people. The new government of Nepal tottered. Mexico announced plans to freeze the prices of 150 staple foods. The U.K. Guardian reported riots in fifteen countries; the New York Times and the World Bank both said thirty. The FAO declared that thirty-seven countries faced food crises due to conflict or disaster at the start of 2008, adding that 1.5 billion people living in degraded lands were at risk of starvation. The Economist magazine succinctly labeled it a \u201csilent tsunami.\u201d\nThe rhetoric reflected the sudden, adventitious nature of the crisis. \u201cIt is an apocalyptic warning,\u201d pronounced Tim Costello, the Australian head of the aid agency World Vision. \u201cUntil recently we had plenty of food: the question was distribution. The truth is because of rising oil prices, global warming and the loss of arable land, all countries that can produce food now desperately need to produce more.\u201d\n\u201cWhat we are witnessing is not a natural disaster \u2014 a silent tsunami or a perfect storm. It is a man-made catastrophe,\u201d the World Bank group president Robert Zoellick advised the G8 leaders feasting in Japan. Major rice-growing countries, including India, Vietnam, China, and Cambodia, imposed export restrictions to curb rice price inflation at home. Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines began stockpiling grain while Pakistan and Rus sia raised wheat export taxes and Brazil, Indonesia, and Argentina imposed export restrictions. Guinea banned all food exports.\nThe panic reached a peak in Asia, where rice prices soared by almost 150 percent in barely a year. \u201cNobody has ever seen such a jump in the price of rice,\u201d said sixty-eight-year-old Kwanchai Gomez, the executive director of the Thai Rice Foundation. Filipino fast-food outlets voluntarily reduced customer portions by half. In Thailand, thieves secretly stripped rice paddies by night to make a fast profit. India banned the export of all non-basmati rice, and Vietnam embargoed rice exports, period, sending Thai rice prices spiraling upward by 30 percent. The giant U.S. retailer Wal-Mart rationed rice sales to customers of its Sam\u2019s Club chain, as did some British retailers. Such mea sures did little to quell the panic, which was originally touched off by a 50 percent drop in surplus rice stocks over the previous seven years. The International Rice Research Institute attributed the crisis to loss of land to industrialization and city sprawl, the growing demand for meat in China and India, and floods or bad weather in Indonesia, Bangladesh, Vietnam, China, and Burma.\nBy mid-2009, accelerated by the worldwide financial crash, thirtythree countries around the world were facing either \u201calarming\u201d or \u201cextremely alarming\u201d food shortages, a billion people were eating less each day \u2014 and most of Earth\u2019s citizens were feeling the pinch. Though food prices fell, alongside prices of stocks and most other commodities, in the subsequent months, they fell only a little \u2014 and then began to rise again.\nWhat happened in 2008 wasn\u2019t the coming famine of the twenty-first century, merely a premonition of what lies ahead. This will not be a single event, affecting all nations and peoples equally at all times, but in one way or another it will leave no person in the world untouched. The reemergence of food scarcity occurs after de cades of plenty, accompanied by the lowest real food prices for consumers in history. These bounteous years were the consequence of a food production miracle achieved by the world\u2019s farmers and agricultural scientists from the 1960s on \u2014 a miracle of which the urbanized world of today seems largely oblivious and which we have forgotten to renew.\nBy the early twenty-first century, signs of complacency were in evidence. In 2003, a conference of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research in Nairobi was told, \u201cAccording to the Food and Agriculture Or ga ni za tion of the United Nations, the number of foodinsecure people in developing countries fell from 920 million in 1980 to 799 million in 1999.\u201d Even in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 food price spike, the FAO itself, along with the Or ga ni za tion for Economic Cooperation and Development, remarked, \u201cthe underlying forces that drive agricultural product supply (by and large productivity gains) will eventually outweigh the forces that determine stronger demand, both for food and feed as well as for industrial demand, most notably for biofuel production. Consequently, prices will resume their decline in real terms, though possibly not by quite as much as in the past.\u201d\nFor some years, reassuring statements such as these had been repeatedly aired in the food policy, overseas aid, and research worlds. Unintentionally, food scientists and policy makers were sending a signal to governments and aid donors around the world that implied, \u201cRelax. It\u2019s under control. We\u2019ve fixed the problem. Food is no longer critical.\u201d Not surprisingly, aid donors rechanneled scarce funds to other urgent priorities \u2014 and growth in crop yields sagged as the world\u2019s foot came off the scientific accelerator.\nMany found the new crisis all the more mysterious for its apparent lack of an obvious trigger. Various culprits were pilloried by blameseeking politicians and media. Biofuels, after being talked up as one of the great hopes for combating climate change, quickly became a villain accused of \u201cburning the food of the poor\u201d and, from China to Britain, countries slammed the brakes on policies intended to encourage farmers to grow more \u201cgreen fuel\u201d from grain. According to the World Bank, biofuels could have caused as much as three-quarters of the hike in food prices. Equally to blame, according to other commentators, were oil prices, which had soared sixfold in the five years from mid-2003 to mid-2008 (although they fell again sharply as the global recession bit deep) with severe consequences for the cost of producing food, through their impact on farmer\u2019s fuel, fertilizer, pesticide, and transportation costs. In developed countries the financial pain was high, but in developing nations it was agony: farmers simply could not afford to buy fertilizer and crop yields began to slip. In Thailand rice farmers quietly parked their new but unaffordable tractors in their sheds and went back to plowing with buffalo; buffalo breeders experienced a bonanza. \u201cEnergy and agricultural prices have become increasingly intertwined,\u201d commented Joachim von Braun, the head of the International Food Policy Research Institute. \u201cHigh energy prices have made agricultural production more expensive by raising the cost of cultivation, inputs \u2014 especially fertilizers and irrigation \u2014 and transportation of inputs and outputs. In poor countries, this hinders production response to high output prices. The main new link between energy and agricultural prices, however, is the competition of grain and oilseed land for feed and food, versus their use for bio energy.\u201d\nSpeculators, fleeing crumbling financial markets and discovering an unlikely haven in booming agricultural commodities, were a favorite target of media ire: \u201cFood was becoming the new gold. Investors fleeing Wall Street\u2019s mortgage-related strife plowed hundreds of millions of dollars into grain futures, driving prices up even more. By Christmas (2007), a global panic was building,\u201d reported the Washington Post. In developing nations, traders and grain dealers were accused of buying up surplus stocks and hoarding them to drive the prices higher still. In the Philippines the government threatened hoarders with charges of economic sabotage and sent armed soldiers to supervise the distribution of subsidized grain. Retirement and hedge funds, casting about for something to invest in that wasn\u2019t going to hell in a handbasket, also jumped on farm commodities and even agribusiness enterprises \u2014 areas such investors traditionally shun.\nMany saw the crisis as simply a result of the growth of human population, the inexorable climb from 3 billion people in 1960 to 6.8 billion by 2008 \u2014 the hundred million more mouths we have to feed in each succeeding year. Others ascribed it chiefly to burgeoning appetites in China and India, which had in a matter of five years or so together added the consumer equivalent of Eu rope to global demand for food as their emergent middle classes indulged in the delights of diets containing far more meat, poultry, dairy, and fish than ever before. In China, meat consumption trebled in less than fifteen years, requiring a tenfold increase in the grain needed to feed the animals and fish. One way to visualize the issue is that growth in global food production of 1\u20131.5 percent a year has more or less kept pace with growth in population \u2014 but has fallen short of meeting the growth in demand. One explanation for this is that farmers around the world have not responded by increasing the area of land they plant and harvest or raising their crop yields so rapidly as in the past. The big question is: why?\nSome blamed the weather. Portentously, many were quick to discern the looming shadow of climate change in the run of droughts, floods, and other natural mishaps that had disrupted global farm production across most continents in recent years. In eastern Australia a ten-year drought slashed grain production and all but obliterated the rice industry; the unpre ce dented draining of Australia\u2019s food bowl, the Murray-Darling Basin, threatened to eliminate fruit, vegetable, and livestock industries reliant on irrigation. Similar hardship faced producers across sub-Sahelian Africa. Floods in China and along the Mississippi River wreaked local havoc with grain production. In Burma, Cyclone Nargis flattened the Irawaddy Delta rice crop, propelling Asian prices into a fresh spiral. Heat waves in California and torrential rains in India added to perceptions \u2014 heightened by media reportage \u2014 that the climate was running amok.\nOther commentators sought villains among the world\u2019s governments, blaming protectionism and hidden trade barriers, farm subsidies, food price controls or taxes, environmental and health restrictions, the ensnaring of farmers in snarls of red tape, along with the perennial failure of trade negotiators to open up global trade in agricultural products. Supermarkets and globalization of the food trade came in for flak, especially from the po liti cal left and from farmers themselves, for driving down farm commodity prices and thus discouraging growers from increasing production. Economic observers read the crisis as primarily due to weaker growth in food production at a time of strong growth in consumer demand, especially in China and India and among affluent populations worldwide.\nThe Green Revolution, whose technologies had delivered the last great surge in global food production in the 1970s and 1980s seemed to be fizzling out, a view supported by the disturbing slide in crop yield advances. Yields of the major crops of wheat, maize, and rice had once increased by as much as 5 and even 10 percent a year \u2014 now they were increasing by 1 percent or nothing at all. In the overheated economy of the early twenty-first century, farm costs had soared along with oil prices, hindering farmers from adopting newer, but costlier and more energyintensive, technologies. In advanced countries, some scientists whispered, we might actually be approaching the physical limits of the ability of plants to turn sunlight into edible food.\nIn the general hunt for someone to blame for the short-term food crisis, a more profound truth was being obscured \u2014 that the challenge is far deeper, longer-term, and more intractable than most people, and certainly most governments, understand. It stems from the magnifying and interacting constraints on food production generated as civilization presses harder against the finite bounds of the planet\u2019s natural resources, combined with human appetites that seem to know no bounds.\nThis challenge is more pressing even than climate change. A climate crisis may emerge over de cades. A food crisis can explode within weeks \u2014 and kill within days. But the two are also interlocked. \u201cIf the world were to experience a year of bad weather similar to that experienced in 1972, the current \u2018food crisis\u2019 would pale in comparison to the crisis that would arise as a result. This should be taken as a warning that advance planning ought to be done if total chaos is to be avoided,\u201d observes the resource analyst Bruce Sundquist.\nThe character of human conflict has also changed: since the early 1990s, more wars have been triggered by disputes over food, land, and water than over mere po liti cal or ethnic differences. This should not surprise us: people have fought over the means of survival for most of history. But in the abbreviated reports on the nightly media, and even in the rarefied realms of government policy, the focus is almost invariably on the players \u2014 the warring national, ethnic, or religious factions \u2014 rather than on the play, the deeper subplots building the tensions that ignite conflict. Caught up in these are groups of ordinary, desperate people fearful that there is no longer sufficient food, land, and water to feed their children \u2014 and believing that they must fight \u201cthe others\u201d to secure them. At the same time, the number of refugees in the world doubled, many of them escaping from conflicts and famines precipitated by food and resource shortages. Governments in troubled regions tottered and fell.\nThe coming famine is planetary because it involves both the immediate effects of hunger on directly affected populations in heavily populated regions of the world in the next forty years \u2014 and also the impacts of war, government failure, refugee crises, shortages, and food price spikes that will affect all human beings, no matter who they are or where they live. It is an emergency because unless it is solved, billions will experience great hardship, and not only in the poorer regions. Mike Murphy, one of the world\u2019s most progressive dairy farmers, with operations in Ireland, New Zealand, and North and South America, succinctly summed it all up: \u201cGlobal warming gets all the publicity but the real imminent threat to the human race is starvation on a massive scale. Taking a 10\u201330 year view, I believe that food shortages, famine and huge social unrest are probably the greatest threat the human race has ever faced. I believe future food shortages are a far bigger world threat than global warming.\u201d\nThe coming famine is also complex, because it is driven not by one or two, or even a half dozen, factors but rather by the confluence of many large and profoundly intractable causes that tend to amplify one another. This means that it cannot easily be remedied by \u201csilver bullets\u201d in the form of technology, subsidies, or single-country policy changes, because of the synergetic character of the things that power it.\nTo see where the answers may lie, we need to explore each of the main drivers. On the demand side the chief drivers are:\nPopulation. Although the rate of growth in human numbers is slowing, the present upward trend of 1.5 percent (one hundred million more people) per year points to a population of around 9.2 billion in 2050 \u2014 3 billion more than in 2000. Most of this expansion will take place in poorer countries and in tropical/subtropical regions. In countries where birth rates are falling, governments are bribing their citizens with subsidies to have more babies in an effort to address the age imbalance.\nConsumer demand. The first thing people do as they climb out of poverty is to improve their diet. Demand for protein foods such as meat, milk, fish, and eggs from consumers with better incomes, mainly in India and China but also in Southeast Asia and Latin America, is rising rapidly. This in turn requires vastly more grain to feed the animals and fish. Overfed rich societies continue to gain weight. The average citizen of Planet Earth eats one-fifth more calories than he or she did in the 1960s \u2014 a \u201cfood footprint\u201d growing larger by the day.\nPopulation and demand. This combination of population growth with expansion in consumer demand indicates a global requirement for food by 2050 that will be around 70\u2013100 percent larger than it is today. Population and demand are together rising at about 2 percent a year, whereas food output is now increasing at only about 1 percent a year.\nThese demand-side factors could probably be satisfied by the world adopting tactics similar to those of the 1960s, when the Green Revolution in farming technology was launched, were it not for the many constraints on the supply side that are now emerging to hinder or prevent such a solution:\nWater crisis. Put simply, civilization is running out of freshwater. Farmers presently use about 70 percent of the world\u2019s readily available freshwater to grow food. However, increasingly megacities, with their huge thirst for water for use in homes, industry, and waste disposal, are competing with farmers for this finite resource and, by 2050, these uses could swallow half or more of the world\u2019s available freshwater at a time when many rivers, lakes, and aquifers will be drying up. Unless major new sources or savings are found, farmers will have about half of the world\u2019s currently available freshwater with which to grow twice the food.\nLand scarcity. The world is running out of good farmland. A quarter of all land is now so degraded that it is scarcely capable of yielding food. At the same time, cities are sprawling, smothering the world\u2019s most fertile soil in concrete and asphalt, while their occupants fan out in search of cheap land for recreation that diverts the best food-producing areas from agriculture. A third category of land is poisoned by toxic industrial pollution. Much former urban food production has now ceased. The emerging global dearth of good farmland represents another severe limit on increasing food production.\nNutrient losses. Civilization is hemorrhaging nutrients \u2014 substances essential to all life. Annual losses in soil erosion alone probably exceed all the nutrients applied as fertilizer worldwide. The world\u2019s finite nutrient supplies may already have peaked. Half the fertilizer being used is wasted. In most societies, up to half the food produced is trashed or lost; so too are most of the nutrients in urban waste streams. The global nutrient cycle, which has sustained humanity throughout our history, has broken down.\nEnergy dilemma. Advanced farming depends entirely on fossil fuels, which are likely to become very scarce and costly within a generation. At present farmers have few alternative means of producing food other than to grow fuel on their farms \u2014 which will reduce food output by 10\u201320 percent. Many farmers respond to higher costs simply by using less fertilizer or fuel \u2014 and so cutting yields. Driven by high energy prices and concerns about climate change, the world is likely to burn around 400 million tonnes (441 million U.S. tons) of grain as biofuels by 2020 \u2014 the equivalent of the entire global rice harvest.\nOceans. Marine scientists have warned that ocean fish catches could collapse by the 2040s due to overexploitation of wild stocks. Coral reefs \u2014 whose fish help feed about five hundred million people \u2014 face decimation under global warming. The world\u2019s oceans are slowly acidifying as carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels dissolves out of the atmosphere, threatening ocean food chains. Fish farms are struggling with pollution and sediment runoff from the land. The inability of the fish sector to meet its share of a doubling in world food demand will throw a heavier burden onto land-based meat industries.\nTechnology. For three de cades the main engine of the modern food miracle, the international scientific research that boosted crop yields, has been neglected, leading to a decline in productivity gains. Farmers worldwide are heading into a major technology pothole, with less new knowledge available in the medium run to help them to increase output.\nClimate. The climate is changing: up to half the planet may face regular drought by the end of the century. \u201cUnnatural disasters\u201d \u2014 storms, floods, droughts, and sea-level rise \u2014 are predicted to become more frequent and intense, with adventitious impacts on food security, refugee waves, and conflict.\nEconomics, politics, and trade. Trade barriers and farm subsidies continue to distort world markets, sending the wrong price signals to farmers and discouraging investment in agriculture and its science. The globalization of food has helped drive down prices received by farmers. Speculators have destabilized commodity markets, making it riskier for farmers to make production decisions. Some countries discourage or ban food exports and others tax them, adding to food insecurity. Others pay their farmers to grow fuel instead of food. A sprawling web of health, labor, and environmental regulation is limiting farmers\u2019 freedom to farm.\nThe collapse in world economic conditions in late 2008 and 2009 has changed the prices of many things, including land, food, fuel, and fertilizer \u2014 but has not altered the fact that demand for food continues to grow while limits on its production multiply. Indeed, the economic crash exacerbated hunger among the world\u2019s poor, and has not altered the fundamentals of climate change, water scarcity, population growth, land degradation, or nutrient or oil depletion.\nIn early 2009 a report by Chatham House, a think tank focused on international affairs, observed that a lower food price \u201cdoes not mean that policy-makers around the world can start to breathe a sigh of relief. . . . [E]ven at their somewhat diminished levels current prices remain acutely problematic for low-income import-dependent countries and for poor people all over the world. The World Bank estimates that higher food prices have increased the number of undernourished people by as much as 100 million from its pre-price-spike level of 850 million.\u201d\nIn the medium and longer term, the report warned, food prices were poised to rise again. \u201cAlthough many policy-makers have taken a degree of comfort from a recent OECD-FAO report on the world\u2019s agricultural outlook to 2017 . . . the report largely overlooked the potential impact of long-term resource scarcity trends, notably climate change, energy security and falling water availability.\u201d\nTo sum it all up, the challenge facing the world\u2019s 1.8 billion women and men who grow our food is to double their output of food \u2014 using far less water, less land, less energy, and less fertilizer. They must accomplish this on low and uncertain returns, with less new technology available, amid more red tape, economic disincentives, and corrupted markets, and in the teeth of spreading drought. Achieving this will require something not far short of a miracle.\nYet humans have done it before and, resilient species that we are, we can do it again. This time, however, it won\u2019t just be a problem for farmers, scientists, and policy makers. It will be a challenge involving every single one of us, in our daily lives, our habits, and our influence at the ballot box and at the supermarket.\nIt will be the greatest test of our global humanity and our wisdom we have yet faced.",

    "text": "As Seas Rise, Future Floats\n2010-10-27T15:14:16.000Z\nPARIS \u2014 It might seem to be a futuristic scene like the one depicted in Kevin Reynolds\u2019s 1995 movie \u201cWaterworld.\u201d But floating pavilions and cities may in fact help communities adapt to the effects of climate change, as well as meet the challenges of ever-rising real estate prices and congestion in urban areas. \nFrom single homes to office blocks and even roads, the construction of floating cities could make low-lying nations habitable amid dramatically rising sea levels and storm surges, according to DeltaSync, a design and research company that specializes in floating urbanization.\nSea levels rose as much as 20 centimeters, or 7.8 inches, over the course of the 20th century, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates a rise of 18 to 59 centimeters by 2099. In low-lying, heavily populated deltas used for agriculture, like those in Bangladesh, China and Egypt, such rises will have a devastating impact.\n\u201cCurrently, for the first time in human history the amount of people that live in urban areas is larger than the amount that live in rural areas,\u201d said Rutger de Graaf, founding partner and research director at DeltaSync. \u201cThe degree of urbanization is expected to rise further toward 70 percent in the 21st century.\u201d\nEleven of the world\u2019s 15 largest cities are built on coastal estuaries. The two largest, Shanghai and Mumbai, have populations of 19.21 million and 13.83 million, respectively, and such rises in sea level would have disastrous consequences for both. In India alone, land losses could range from 1,000 to 2,000 square kilometers, or 385 to 770 square miles, by 2030, destroying as many as 150,000 livelihoods, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.\nAs traditional land use or creating landfills is not a sustainable answer to the unpredictable effects of climate change, DeltaSync believes floating-city technology offers a better solution. In countries like the Netherlands, where approximately half of the land lies less than a meter above sea level, such technology is a viable alternative to repeated raising of dikes, which must be altered in accordance with rising sea levels. Floating constructions naturally rise with the water level, negating the need for adjustments or rebuilding. \nFloating pavilions are also a less risky option, as dikes may be in danger of eroding, shifting or even eventually tearing open, unleashing floodwaters of devastating destruction.\nFloating cities could also be a practical solution to overpopulation and congestion, opening up the possibility of more space for civilian housing and public buildings. In New York City, almost half of all high school students were studying in overcrowded conditions in the 2008-9 school year, according to the Independent Budget Office, which provides nonpartisan budget information about the city. Creating a floating facility could be a practical answer to such congestion-related problems.\n\u201cConstructing floating buildings is a promising solution,\u201d Mr. de Graaf said. \u201cIt enables multifunctional use of space in densely populated areas, without further increasing flood risk.\u201d\nThe world\u2019s first floating pavilion was built in Rotterdam. It was constructed as a response to the city\u2019s objectives to reduce CO2 emissions by 50 percent and to ensure that Rotterdam remains climate-change resilient in the future.\n\u201cTwelve months ago, all we had was a sketch, a plan, and the drive to make it work,\u201d said Rob Tummers, building director of Dura Vermeer, the construction group behind the pavilion, when the structure was formally unveiled to the public on June 26. \u201cThe laws and regulations required to build it had yet to be developed and adopted.\u201d\nThe construction, which took just six months to complete, was built directly on the water, rather than on a dry dock. It serves as an exhibition and reception space focusing on Rotterdam\u2019s water management, climate change and energy. The pavilion is 12 meters high, with a floor space the size of four tennis courts, and can accommodate approximately 500 visitors. It has a plaza and dome section, including an auditorium that can seat up to 150 guests. Although it can be moved, it will remain moored in the Rijnhaven port for five years.\nPaula Verhoeven, Rotterdam\u2019s climate director, called the project \u201cremarkable,\u201d noting that it demonstrates Dutch \u201cability to realize sustainable and climate change resilient constructions.\u201d \nTo ensure that the pavilion remained lightweight and thus unsinkable, it was constructed using five layers of expanded polystyrene sheets, the thinnest layer measuring 20 centimeters and the thickest 75 centimeters, and made buoyant by tiny air-permeated cells. The thickest layer contained a grid of concrete beams and was fastened to prefabricated concrete slabs, forming the hard shell of the island and acting as a protection against waves. The subsequent addition of a 20-centimeter-thick concrete floor made the island\u2019s total thickness 2.25 meters and rendered the floating island a rigid unit. \n\u201cBuilding three to four levels high is possible without problems,\u201d Mr. de Graaf said, addressing concerns about the stability of the structure. \u201cHigher can be done, but it requires larger platforms than the building footprint or more depth to stabilize.\u201d\nIn order to continue to keep the weight to a minimum, the domes of the pavilion were clad with special ETFE foil, a transparent material that is approximately 100 times lighter than glass. The pavilion is connected to the mainland by a footbridge.\nThe construction also implements a Thermal Energy Storage system, with layers of water acting as insulation for the storage facility, maintaining a sustainable energy and hot water supply through solar panels. Water is collected through rain-water harvesting, or by drawing from the large reserve on which the pavilion floats. Subsequent constructions would adopt similar techniques, with the goal that floating cities be self-sufficient in terms of both water and energy supply, relying on solar energy and surface water. Even the toilet water will be purified by its own system. \nMr. de Graaf, also a civil engineer, is in talks with officials in New York and other cities. \u201cWe are talking about starting up a data collection study to gain more insight in the water quality aspects of building on water,\u201d he said. \u201cWater in lakes and old port areas are perfect because of the gentle wave conditions.\u201d\nRotterdam\u2019s pioneering model could be the first of many to come, as such projects are not unique to DeltaSync. Waterstudio.NL , an architectural and city planning company, has unveiled similar innovations to build floating structures. Its master plan, called Het Nieuwe Water, or The New Water, is geared toward \u201ca new relationship with the water.\u201d The project was presented to the 2009 World Architecture News Awards and is \u201cone of the leading projects of architectural homes,\u201d according to its architect, Koen Olthuis.\nThe project includes a total of 1,200 new houses, of which some 600 will be floating. The planned area of development is one of the lowest areas of the Netherlands, between The Hague, the North Sea beach and Rotterdam, on land reclaimed from the sea. It once housed greenhouses, but these have now been cleared to make way for the project.\n\u201cThe building work will be completed on dry land,\u201d Mr. Olthuis said. \u201cAfterwards, we break down the dikes and let water come in.\u201d\nThe first stage of the project will be construction of Citadel, the world\u2019s first floating apartment complex, with a planned 60 luxury apartments, including parking spaces and large terraces. The New Water is scheduled for completion by 2017.",

    "text": "Mamaroneck, N.Y.\n2010-06-11T21:47:39.000Z\nIN his 73 years, Sid Albert has never lived anywhere but the 3.2-square-mile village of Mamaroneck, on Long Island Sound. \u201cWhy would I?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019ve found everything I\u2019ve ever wanted, right here.\u201d\nMr. Albert was born in a low-income neighborhood known as Strawberry Patch; he graduated from Mamaroneck High School in 1956 and tried to make a go of it in local commerce, opening a book and record shop on Mamaroneck Avenue. But the village\u2019s business fortunes were on the wane back then, so after marrying, he switched gears and began commuting to a job with Random House in Manhattan from the local Metro-North Railroad station. \nIt was when he settled into his publishing job in 1970 that he and his wife paid $40,000 for a four-bedroom colonial in the Rye Neck section, where they raised three children. Divorce 20 years later didn\u2019t alter his feelings about the village. He stayed on, paying $75,000 for a two-bedroom co-op in a building nearby. Recently he moved to a larger unit in the complex. The price this time was $350,000, he said.\nSaidur Dawn, who is originally from Bangladesh, is a more recent arrival and a renter, paying about $1,800 a month for a large one-bedroom. But he isn\u2019t planning on going anywhere either \u0097 because unlike Mr. Albert, he had luckier timing on Mamaroneck Avenue, opening his Cafe Mozart 15 years ago. Since then he has seen a succession of other businesses flock to town. In the last two years alone, he said, seven restaurants have opened.\nThis commercial strength, along with the diversity represented by both men (Mr. Albert is black), gives the village a certain distinction among Westchester\u2019s more prosperous communities. At a time when many suburban business areas are ailing, Mamaroneck Avenue has emerged in the county as a go-to destination. \u201cOne business sees another succeeding, and that encourages them,\u201d said Mr. Dawn, who hosts live music inside the cafe during the colder months and outdoors during the summer. \u201cWe strive to create a very European atmosphere,\u201d he said.\nCensus figures depict a largely white population; but when compared with similar neighboring communities Mamaroneck has more variety: Of about 18,400 residents, 18 percent describe themselves as Hispanic and 4 percent as black, along with smaller percentages of Japanese, Chinese and South Asian. \nWhen Sue and Steve Odierna bought their first house 15 years ago, just before the rebirth of downtown, they were drawn to that mix of cultures. \u201cWe liked that this wasn\u2019t just another white wealthy suburban enclave on the water,\u201d Mrs. Odierna said. \n \u201cThese days it\u2019s even better,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen you walk down Mamaroneck Avenue, you hear Italian spoken in front of the bakery and Spanish in front of the Latino grocery stores, and then, in front of Siren Boutique, you see these women with perfectly coiffed hairdos and gorgeous jewelry. It\u2019s an exciting mix.\u201d\n To further fuel growth, the Mamaroneck Chamber of Commerce sponsors downtown events throughout the year, the most recent having been Harbor Fest on June 6, which drew 15,000 people, many of them from neighboring towns, to sidewalk booths lining the main street and to the waterfront, said Jennifer Graziano, the chamber president. \u201cThe chamber tells businesses, \u2018If you come hang your hat in Mamaroneck, there\u2019s a support system here for you,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she added. \nMr. Albert, who is now retired, said the commercial vitality had added a new element to his life. He still spends a lot of time by the glittering waterfront he loved as a child, reading the newspaper, watching the boats come in and out of the harbor, and talking politics with a group of fellow retirees. \u201cBut in the evenings,\u201d he said, \u201cnow that we\u2019ve got \u2018restaurant row\u2019 right here. I don\u2019t have to go to New York for that anymore.\u201d\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL FIND\n The village, 23 miles from Midtown Manhattan, is in a 30-square-mile watershed at the confluence of the Mamaroneck and Sheldrake Rivers, and that has left it highly vulnerable over the years to inland flooding. One of the worst and most costly floods occurred in April 2007, when a northeaster caused about $1.5 million in losses to the village and tens of millions of dollars in damage to private property, said Richard Slingerland, the village manager.\nThe most expensive houses in the village \u0097 which is partly within the town of Mamaroneck and partly within the town of Rye in an area called Rye Neck \u0097 are found along six miles of a coastline that reaches out in sections like long fingers into the sound. Among the most sought-after neighborhoods for boaters are Harbor Lawn and Shore Acres on the eastern side of the harbor near Rye, whose 200 or so homes have easy access to beaches, pools and marinas. Another is Orienta Point, once known as \u201cHollywood in the East,\u201d where D. W. Griffith set up a film studio in 1919 and the actor Sal Mineo once lived.\nIn all, there are 2,816 single-family houses, 697 two-families, 85 three-families, 93 apartment buildings, 734 condominium units \u0097 some in complexes, some standalone town houses \u0097 and 11 co-op buildings, according to the office of Lloyd T. Wright, the village assessor. Two condo complexes have been built in the last five years.\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL PAY\n The median price of a single-family house was $725,000 in the first quarter, down from $820,000 a year ago but up from $698,000 in 2005, said John Hofstetter, an agent at Coldwell Banker. The average number of days on the market has increased to 165, from 142 last year and 107 in 2005. \nThe median price for a condo is $417,000, down from $437,000 a year ago but up from $395,000 five years ago. For co-ops, the median is $185,000, down from $204,000 last year and from $252,000 five years ago.\nAt the lower end of the price spectrum, a one-bedroom one-bath condo in a prewar building with a swimming pool and mooring dock on the waterfront is listed at $479,900, with property taxes of $3,537 a year and a common charge of $501 a month. In the middle, a four-bedroom three-and-a-half-bath colonial with a fireplace in the living room and a breakfast area in the kitchen is listed at $899,000, with an annual tax bill of $18,126. On the high end, a five-bedroom shingle-style house directly on the sound, with five full and two half baths and a great room, is listed for $5.498 million. Taxes are $90,796.\nWHAT TO DO\nOn summer weekends, the water is the focus for Mr. and Mrs. Odierna and their children, ages 13, 11 and 9. The couple \u0097 she is a stay-at-home mother; he commutes to his job with J. P. Morgan in Manhattan \u0097 are trading in their 25-foot power boat for a 40-footer that will be large enough for overnight trips with the children and the family dog, a black Labrador. The Odiernas keep their boat in Mamaroneck Harbor and take off for long weekends on Block Island and sites along the Connecticut shoreline.\nThe 45-acre Harbor Island Park, along the water at the foot of Mamaroneck Avenue, is also a magnet for many families. When Karl and Martine Brown, who bought a three-bedroom 1890s colonial three years ago in the Rye Neck section for about $900,000, aren\u2019t working in their orchard and woodland garden, they take their two toddler daughters to the beach at the park to swim. \u201cWe love living so close to the water,\u201d said Mr. Brown, an associate director at the Rockefeller Foundation in Manhattan. \u201cThat is one of the main reasons we bought a home here.\u201d\nFor lunch, Sal\u2019s Pizzeria on Post Road is a favorite with their children. And on weekend evenings, there is of course restaurant row. \nTHE SCHOOLS\n There are two public school districts: Mamaroneck has four elementary schools, one middle and one high school, serving half of Mamaroneck Village and all of neighboring Larchmont. The Rye Neck Union Free School District, which also serves a part of Rye, has a high school, a middle school and two elementary schools.\nSAT averages at Mamaroneck High last year were 583 in reading, 599 in math and 581 in writing. At Rye Neck High the numbers were 576, 574 and 563. State averages were 480, 500 and 470.\nTHE COMMUTE\n The 7:22 a.m. Metro-North Railroad express train gets to Grand Central Terminal in 38 minutes. A monthly pass bought online costs $205.80. A round-trip Web ticket during peak hours costs $18.52. By car, the drive south to Midtown on Interstate 95 takes about 40 minutes, depending on traffic.\n THE HISTORY\nJohn Richbell, a Boston merchant and West Indies trader, received the land from the Siwanoy band in 1661 in exchange for shirts, wampum and gunpowder. The highly traveled Boston Post Road, which parallels the shoreline, was a former Siwanoy trail. In the 1890s the areas surrounding the Sheldrake and Mamaroneck Rivers became Mamaroneck, which was incorporated in 1895. ",

    "text": "China Seems Set to Loosen Hold on Its Currency\n2010-04-08T14:36:19.000Z\nHONG KONG \u2014 The Chinese government is preparing to announce in the coming days that it will allow its currency to strengthen slightly and vary more from day to day, people with knowledge of the emerging consensus in Beijing said on Thursday. The move would help ease tension with the Obama administration about the United States\u2019 huge trade deficit with China. \nChina\u2019s exports have been bolstered by its policy of keeping its currency, known as the renminbi or yuan, pegged at a nearly fixed rate to the dollar. Many members of Congress and economists say that by spending several hundred billion dollars each year to hold down the value of the renminbi, China has made its exports extremely competitive in foreign markets and taken away sales from manufacturers in the United States and other countries.\nBut if China allows only a small move in the renminbi, the effects on the American trade deficit may also be small. Chinese companies are formidably competitive and, while labor costs are rising in China, transportation and communication costs are plunging because of heavy investment in new expressways and rail lines.\nA marginally stronger renminbi would make Chinese goods only marginally more expensive in the United States and make American goods slightly cheaper in China, which is now exporting more than four times as much to the United States as it imports.\nThe move is being made for domestic policy reasons in China, primarily as an inflation-fighting tool, people with knowledge of the emerging consensus in Beijing said on Thursday. While any announcement could still be delayed, China\u2019s central bank appears to have prevailed with its arguments within the Chinese leadership for a stronger but more flexible currency, these people said.\n Insisting on anonymity because of the delicacy of the issue in Beijing, they predicted that China\u2019s policy shift could easily occur before President Hu Jintao arrives in Washington next week for discussions with President Obama and other world leaders on improving nuclear security.\n Administration officials, especially Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, have publicly kept quiet to avoid giving the impression that a currency policy shift by China was a result of American pressure, instead of a decision based on what was best for the Chinese economy. Mr. Geithner maintained that silence on Thursday, holding meetings with senior officials in Hong Kong before flying in midafternoon to Beijing for a brief stopover and a meeting with Vice Premier Wang Qishan.\n A terse Treasury statement after the meeting with Mr. Wang noted only that the two men \u201cexchanged views on U.S.-China economic relations, the global economic situation and issues relating to the upcoming economic track dialogue of the second U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, to be held in Beijing in late May.\u201d\nChinese officials have been publicly wrangling over what to do about the currency for a month. The central bank favors a prompt move, while the Commerce Ministry, aligned with exporters, has opposed currency appreciation. The Obama administration has stayed scrupulously silent, fearing that public comments could backfire by stirring a nationalist reaction in Beijing against international pressure. \nHolding down the value of the renminbi through huge currency market intervention has become an enormous expense for China. The central bank spent 9.2 percent of the country\u2019s economic output last year on the purchase of foreign reserves, mainly Treasuries that are now paying low interest.\nA stronger renminbi could prove to be a mixed blessing for the United States. If China cuts back sharply on purchases of Treasuries, then the Obama administration could find it harder to finance American budget deficits. \nBut with the Chinese economy booming, a small move in the renminbi may still leave the central bank struggling with trade surpluses and a tide of speculative investment into China. That could force it to continue buying Treasuries with the extra dollars.\nAllowing wider variation in the currency would also make it easier for China\u2019s central bank to fight inflation, which Wen Jiabao, the premier, identified last month as a top concern for the leadership. Consumer prices were 2.7 percent higher in February than a year earlier, after prices were falling as recently as last October. Inflation is accelerating in China faster than most Western economists expected.\nA stronger currency helps hold down prices by making imports cheaper. It also gives China\u2019s central bank more room to raise interest rates and brake economic growth while lessening the risk of drawing more speculative investments into the country. \n A slightly stronger renminbi that fluctuates each day against the dollar would mainly hurt low-margin, labor-intensive industries in China like shoes and textiles. Many Beijing officials have been worried about job losses in these industries if the currency appreciates. \n Much of this production is already starting to move out of China, notably to Vietnam and Bangladesh, where labor costs have stayed low. And Chinese factories producing these goods have been struggling to find enough workers over the last two months as the economy grew powerfully this winter, stimulated by heavy bank lending, strong demand for workers in the retail sector and rising government spending on high-speed rail lines and other infrastructure investments. \nIn 2005, China allowed the renminbi to jump 2 percent overnight against the dollar and then trade in a wider daily range, with a trend toward further strengthening against the dollar. For its coming policy shift, China may follow a similar pattern, but officials may emphasize much more in public remarks that the value of the renminbi can fall as well as rise on any given day. That would help discourage a flood of speculative money into China from investors betting on rapid further appreciation in the currency, said people with knowledge of the emerging consensus in Beijing.\nXia Bin, a member of the monetary policy committee of the Chinese central bank, hinted at the new policy for the currency while attending a forum in Shanghai on Thursday. \n \u201cWhether to let the yuan slowly appreciate or let it rise to a tolerable range after careful calculation, I think it is better to have that quick, prompt appreciation,\u201d he said, according to news service reports. \n Mr. Xia later added that, \u201cAt a certain point, when necessary, it is better to have a quick, prompt appreciation in a bid to fend off speculative capital.\u201d \nBut Mr. Xia, who spoke after others had already described an emerging consensus in Beijing in favor of a small move in the currency, cautioned that no one should expect a \u201clarge, one-time\u201d appreciation of the renminbi of the sort that many members of Congress have sought.\n The central bank declined to comment on its currency plans.",

    "text": "With Haitian Schools in Ruins, Children in Limbo\n2010-03-06T16:07:47.000Z\nPORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti \u2014 Thousands of schools in and around this devastated capital could remain closed for months or never reopen, according to Haitian and United Nations education officials. That leaves vast numbers of children languishing in camps or working in menial jobs as they struggle to survive.\nEven before the Jan. 12 earthquake, only about half of Haiti\u2019s school-age children were enrolled in classes, a glaring symbol of the nation\u2019s poverty. \nUnicef, basing its estimates on talks with government officials, said that more than 3,000 school buildings in the earthquake zone had been destroyed or damaged. Hundreds of teachers and thousands of students were killed, and officials are questioning the safety of the remaining buildings after violent aftershocks in recent weeks, making the goal of Haitian education officials to reopen many schools by April 1 seem increasingly remote.\n\u201cWe have six engineers in the Education Ministry to survey more than 10,000 schools to see if they\u2019re safe,\u201d said Charles Tardieu, a former education minister who is pushing for schools to reopen in tent camps. \u201cLet\u2019s face the reality that many schools are never going to be used again, and that we urgently need other ways to revive the system,\u201d he said.\n With their options limited, thousands of children are toiling on this city\u2019s streets instead of going to school. Marckin Sainvalier, 10, helped his grandmother wash clothes one recent morning alongside the rubble of Rue Bonne-Foi in the central commercial district. As for school, \u201cthat was before the earthquake,\u201d he said, explaining that his mother left him in his grandmother\u2019s care in the chaotic days after the quake struck. \u201cA lot has happened since then.\u201d\nOn another street in the commercial district, Dieuvenson Semervil, 12, scavenged for padlocks in a collapsed hardware store. Before the quake, Dieuvenson said, he dreamed of becoming a mechanic. A body decomposed next to him to as he picked through the rubble. Near the ruins of the partly destroyed Lyc\u00e9e Alexandre P\u00e9tion, one of the city\u2019s public schools, Samanta Louis, 11, swept the sidewalk, work she said helped support her nine siblings and parents who lived in the tent camp of Champs de Mars. A former student at the Lyc\u00e9e, Jean Pierre Lestin, 15, scavenged brick from a collapsed wall to sell. \u201cI would like to be an engineer someday,\u201d he said.\nChildren staying in the camps face trials beyond laboring in the streets. Health workers in the camps are reporting a rising number of young rape victims, including girls as young as 12. Alison Thompson, an Australian nurse and documentary director who volunteers at a tent clinic on the grounds of the P\u00e9tionville Club, said she had cared for a 14-year-old girl who was raped recently in the camp.\n\u201cThe entire structure of the lives of these children has been upended, and now they\u2019re dealing with the predators living next to them,\u201d Ms. Thompson said.\nThe government here has recognized the urgency of reopening schools to provide some structure to those picking up the pieces of their lives. But its efforts to do so have faltered. Officials declared schools open in unaffected areas as of Feb. 1; some students have trickled into those schools, but many have not, say education specialists.\nHere in the capital, symbols of the devastated education system lie scattered throughout the city. Metal scavengers are still picking through the wrecked Coll\u00e8ge du Canap\u00e9-Vert, where as many as 300 students studying to become teachers died in the earthquake. \nForeign aid groups here say that Haiti differs from other poor nations recently struck by natural disasters, like Pakistan and Bangladesh, in that the quake gutted the education system of the capital in a highly centralized country. In New Orleans, more than half of the public schools remained shut a year after Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005, said Marcelo Cabral, an education specialist with the Inter-American Development Bank.\nHaiti\u2019s education system was already dysfunctional before the earthquake. Only about 20 percent of schools were public, with the rest highly expensive for the poor. Even in public schools, poor families struggled to pay for uniforms, textbooks and supplies. While other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean spend about 5 percent of their gross domestic product on education, Haiti was spending just 2 percent, according to the Inter-American Development Bank.\n\u201cThe quality of education was very low, with about a third of teachers having nine years of education at best,\u201d Mr. Cabral said in an interview here, after a recent meeting with Haitian officials in an attempt to come up with a plan to reopen schools. Mr. Cabral said the Inter-American Development Bank estimated that Haiti needed $2 billion over the next five years to rebuild its education system.\nChildren make up about 45 percent of Haiti\u2019s population, and they are flooding the camps. Hundreds of children milled about the latrines of a camp at the prime minister\u2019s office complex one day at the end of last month. \u201cI have nothing to do,\u201d said Belle-Fleur Merline, 11, who lives at the camp with her father and two siblings.\nPlacid Francoise, 17, said she had hoped to become a nurse before the earthquake destroyed her family\u2019s home and forced them into a camp in front of the ruins of the presidential palace. Her mother, a street vendor, had used her meager savings to pay Ms. Francoise\u2019s tuition at the Fr\u00e8res Monfort school.\nNow Ms. Francoise lives in a one-room shack with more than a dozen relatives. She said she had no idea when she would return to school. \u201cI work for my mother each day now, so that we may eat,\u201d she said, pointing to the bags of charcoal they sell in front of their hovel. \nSome educators and relief officials are not waiting for the government to act, deciding to open their own schools on a piecemeal basis in some camps.\nAlzire Rocourt, a headmaster at a private school here before the earthquake, opened a school last month under tents donated by the Israeli Army in the sprawling P\u00e9tionville Club camp. She teaches reading, math and geography. The students play volleyball on the dirt outside during recess. And they sing, with vigor, Creole folk songs. \n\u201cApran yon ak lot,\u201d the children sang, beaming. \u201cLearning together.\u201d\n \u201cRenmen yon ak lot,\u201d they ended. \u201cIt means, \u2018Loving each other,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Rocourt said.\nShe smiled, too, until she recalled how much more needed to be done. Of the more than 25,000 children living in the P\u00e9tionville camp, just 260 are in her school.",

    "text": "As Glaciers Melt, Science Seeks Data on Rising Seas\n2010-11-14T02:01:16.000Z\nTASIILAQ, Greenland \u2014 With a tense pilot gripping the stick, the helicopter hovered above the water, a red speck of machinery lost in a wilderness of rock and ice.\nTo the right, a great fjord stretched toward the sea, choked with icebergs. To the left loomed one of the immense glaciers that bring ice from the top of the Greenland ice sheet and dump it into the ocean.\nHanging out the sides of the craft, two scientists sent a measuring device plunging into the water, between ice floes. Near the bottom, it reported a temperature of 40 degrees. It was the latest in a string of troubling measurements showing that the water was warm enough to melt glaciers rapidly from below.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the highest we\u2019ve seen this far up the fjord,\u201d said one of the scientists, Fiammetta Straneo.\nThe temperature reading was a new scrap of information in the effort to answer one of the most urgent \u2014 and most widely debated \u2014 questions facing humanity: How fast is the world\u2019s ice going to melt?\nScientists long believed that the collapse of the gigantic ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica would take thousands of years, with sea level possibly rising as little as seven inches in this century, about the same amount as in the 20th century.\nBut researchers have recently been startled to see big changes unfold in both Greenland and Antarctica.\nAs a result of recent calculations that take the changes into account, many scientists now say that sea level is likely to rise perhaps three feet by 2100 \u2014 an increase that, should it come to pass, would pose a threat to coastal regions the world over.\nAnd the calculations suggest that the rise could conceivably exceed six feet, which would put thousands of square miles of the American coastline under water and would probably displace tens of millions of people in Asia.\nThe scientists say that a rise of even three feet would inundate low-lying lands in many countries, rendering some areas uninhabitable. It would cause coastal flooding of the sort that now happens once or twice a century to occur every few years. It would cause much faster erosion of beaches, barrier islands and marshes. It would contaminate fresh water supplies with salt.\nIn the United States, parts of the East Coast and Gulf Coast would be hit hard. In New York, coastal flooding could become routine, with large parts of Queens and Brooklyn especially vulnerable. About 15 percent of the urbanized land in the Miami region could be inundated. The ocean could encroach more than a mile inland in parts of North Carolina.\nAbroad, some of the world\u2019s great cities \u2014 London, Cairo, Bangkok, Venice and Shanghai among them \u2014 would be critically endangered by a three-foot rise in the sea.\nClimate scientists readily admit that the three-foot estimate could be wrong. Their understanding of the changes going on in the world\u2019s land ice is still primitive. But, they say, it could just as easily be an underestimate as an overestimate. One of the deans of American coastal studies, Orrin H. Pilkey of Duke University, is advising coastal communities to plan for a rise of at least five feet by 2100.\n\u201cI think we need immediately to begin thinking about our coastal cities \u2014 how are we going to protect them?\u201d said John A. Church, an Australian scientist who is a leading expert on sea level. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to protect everything. We will have to abandon some areas.\u201d\nSea-level rise has been a particularly contentious element in the debate over global warming. One published estimate suggested the threat was so dire that sea level could rise as much as 15 feet in this century. Some of the recent work that produced the three-foot projection was carried out specifically to counter more extreme calculations.\nGlobal warming skeptics, on the other hand, contend that any changes occurring in the ice sheets are probably due to natural climate variability, not to greenhouse gases released by humans.\nSuch doubts have been a major factor in the American political debate over global warming, stalling efforts by Democrats and the Obama administration to pass legislation that would curb emissions of heat-trapping gases. Similar legislative efforts are likely to receive even less support in the new Congress, with many newly elected legislators openly skeptical about climate change.\nA large majority of climate scientists argue that heat-trapping gases are almost certainly playing a role in what is happening to the world\u2019s land ice. They add that the lack of policies to limit emissions is raising the risk that the ice will go into an irreversible decline before this century is out, a development that would eventually make a three-foot rise in the sea look trivial.\nMelting ice is by no means the only sign that the earth is warming. Thermometers on land, in the sea and aboard satellites show warming. Heat waves, flash floods and other extreme weather events are increasing. Plants are blooming earlier, coral reefs are dying and many other changes are afoot that most climate scientists attribute to global warming.\nYet the rise of the sea could turn out to be the single most serious effect. While the United States is among the countries at greatest risk, neither it nor any other wealthy country has made tracking and understanding the changes in the ice a strategic national priority.\nThe consequence is that researchers lack elementary information. They have been unable even to measure the water temperature near some of the most important ice on the planet, much less to figure out if that water is warming over time. Vital satellites have not been replaced in a timely way, so that American scientists are losing some of their capability to watch the ice from space.\nThe missing information makes it impossible for scientists to be sure how serious the situation is.\n\u201cAs a scientist, you have to stick to what you know and what the evidence suggests,\u201d said Gordon Hamilton, one of the researchers in the helicopter. \u201cBut the things I\u2019ve seen in Greenland in the last five years are alarming. We see these ice sheets changing literally overnight.\u201d\nDodging Icebergs\nIn the brilliant sunshine of a late summer day in southeastern Greenland, the pilot at the controls of the red helicopter, Morgan Goransson, dropped low toward the water. He used the downdraft from his rotor to clear ice from the surface of Sermilik Fjord.\nThe frigid waters were only 30 feet below, so any mechanical problem would have sent the chopper plunging into the sea. \u201cIt is so dangerous,\u201d Mr. Goransson said later that night, over a fish dinner.\nTaking the temperature of waters near the ice sheet is essential if scientists are to make sense of what is happening in Greenland. But it is a complex and risky business.\nThe two scientists \u2014 Dr. Straneo, of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, and Dr. Hamilton, of the University of Maine \u2014 are part of a larger team that has been traveling here every summer with financing from the National Science Foundation, the federal agency that sponsors much of the nation\u2019s most important research. Not only do they remove the doors of helicopters and lean over icy fjords to get their readings, but they dodge huge icebergs in tiny boats and traipse over glaciers scarred by crevasses that could swallow large buildings.\nThe reading that the scientists obtained a few weeks ago, of 40 degrees near the bottom of the fjord, fit a broader pattern that researchers have been detecting in the past few years.\nWater that originated far to the south, in warmer parts of the Atlantic Ocean, is flushing into Greenland\u2019s fjords at a brisk pace. Scientists suspect that as it melts the ice from beneath, the warm water is loosening the connection of the glaciers to the ground and to nearby rock.\nThe effect has been something like popping a Champagne cork, allowing the glaciers to move faster and dump more ice into the ocean. Within the past decade, the flow rate of many of Greenland\u2019s biggest glaciers has doubled or tripled. Some of them have eventually slowed back down, but rarely have they returned to their speed of the 1990s.\nTwo seismologists, Meredith Nettles and G\u00f6ran Ekstr\u00f6m of Columbia University, discovered a few years ago that unusual earthquakes were emanating from the Greenland glaciers as they dumped the extra ice into the sea. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that an iceberg can do this, but when that loss of ice occurs, it does generate a signal that sets up a vibration that you can record all across the globe,\u201d Dr. Nettles said in an interview in Greenland.\nAnalyzing past records, they discovered that these quakes had increased severalfold from the level of the early 1990s, a sign of how fast the ice is changing.\nSatellite and other measurements suggest that through the 1990s, Greenland was gaining about as much ice through snowfall as it lost to the sea every year. But since then, the warmer water has invaded the fjords, and air temperatures in Greenland have increased markedly. The overall loss of ice seems to be accelerating, an ominous sign given that the island contains enough ice to raise global sea levels by more than 20 feet.\nStrictly speaking, scientists have not proved that human-induced global warming is the cause of the changes. They are mindful that the climate in the Arctic undergoes big natural variations. In the 1920s and \u201930s, for instance, a warm spell caused many glaciers to retreat.\nJohn R. Christy, a climatologist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville who is often critical of mainstream climate science, said he suspected that the changes in Greenland were linked to this natural variability, and added that he doubted that the pace would accelerate as much as his colleagues feared.\nFor high predictions of sea-level rise to be correct, \u201csome big chunks of the Greenland ice sheet are going to have to melt, and they\u2019re just not melting that way right now,\u201d Dr. Christy said.\nYet other scientists say that the recent changes in Greenland appear more pervasive than those of the early 20th century, and that they are occurring at the same time that air and ocean temperatures are warming, and ice melt is accelerating, throughout much of the world.\nHelheim Glacier, which terminates in Sermilik Fjord, is one of a group of glaciers in southeastern Greenland that have shown especially big changes.\nOn a recent day, the red helicopter landed on a rocky outcrop above the glacier, a flowing river of ice about 25 miles long and nearly four miles wide. On the side of the canyon, Dr. Hamilton pointed toward a band of light-colored rock.\nIt was, in essence, a bathtub ring.\nSomething caused the glacier, one of Greenland\u2019s largest, to speed up sharply in the middle of the last decade, and it spit so much ice into the ocean that it thinned by some 300 feet in a few years. A part of the canyon that was once shielded from the sun by ice was thus left exposed.\nThe glacier has behaved erratically ever since, and with variations, that pattern is being repeated all over Greenland. \u201cAll these changes are happening at a far faster pace than we would have ever predicted from our conventional theories,\u201d Dr. Hamilton said.\nA few days after the helicopter trip, an old Greenlandic freighter nudged its way gingerly up Sermilik Fjord, which was so choked with ice that the boat had to stop well short of its goal. \u201cYou have to be flexible to work out here,\u201d said the leader of the team that day, Dr. Straneo of Woods Hole.\n\n12 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nSoon she was barking orders, and her team swung into motion. A cold, Arctic drizzle fell on the boat and the people. Off the port side in a rickety skiff, David Sutherland, a young scientist at the University of Washington, tossed a floating buoy, carrying a string of instruments, into the water, and an anchor snatched it below the surface. Over the next year, it will measure temperature, currents and other factors in the fjord.\nDr. Sutherland climbed back aboard the freighter with cold, wet feet. As the boat headed back to port, it passed icebergs the size of city blocks, chunks of the Greenland ice sheet bound for the open sea.\nAn Ocean in Flux\nThe strongest reason to think that the level of the sea could undergo big changes in the future is that it has done so in the past.\nWith the waxing and waning of ice ages, driven by wobbles in the earth\u2019s orbit, sea level has varied by hundreds of feet, with shorelines moving many miles in either direction. \u201cWe\u2019re used to the shoreline being fixed, and it\u2019s not,\u201d said Robin E. Bell, a scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University.\nBut at all times in the past, when the shoreline migrated, humans either had not evolved yet or consisted of primitive bands of hunter-gatherers who could readily move. By the middle of this century, a projected nine billion people will inhabit the planet, with many millions of them living within a few feet of sea level.\nTo a majority of climate scientists, the question is not whether the earth\u2019s land ice will melt in response to the greenhouse gases those people are generating, but whether it will happen too fast for society to adjust.\nRecent research suggests that the volume of the ocean may have been stable for thousands of years as human civilization has developed. But it began to rise in the 19th century, around the same time that advanced countries began to burn large amounts of coal and oil.\nThe sea has risen about eight inches since then, on average. That sounds small, but on a gently sloping shoreline, such an increase is enough to cause substantial erosion unless people intervene. Governments have spent billions in recent decades pumping sand onto disappearing beaches and trying to stave off the loss of coastal wetlands.\nScientists have been struggling for years to figure out if a similar pace of sea-level rise is likely to continue in this century \u2014 or whether it will accelerate. In its last big report, in 2007, the United Nations group that assesses climate science, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said that sea level would rise at least seven more inches, and might rise as much as two feet, in the 21st century.\nBut the group warned that these estimates did not fully incorporate \u201cice dynamics,\u201d the possibility that the world\u2019s big ice sheets, as well as its thousands of smaller glaciers and ice caps, would start spitting ice into the ocean at a much faster rate than it could melt on land. Scientific understanding of this prospect was so poor, the climate panel said, that no meaningful upper limit could be put on the potential rise of sea level.\nThat report prompted fresh attempts by scientists to calculate the effect of ice dynamics, leading to the recent, revised projections of sea-level rise.\nSatellite evidence suggests that the rise of the sea accelerated late in the 20th century, so that the level is now increasing a little over an inch per decade, on average \u2014 about a foot per century. Increased melting of land ice appears to be a major factor. Another is that most of the extra heat being trapped by human greenhouse emissions is going not to warm the atmosphere but to warm the ocean, and as it warms, the water expands.\nWith the study of the world\u2019s land ice still in its early stages, scientists have lately been trying crude methods to figure out how much the pace might accelerate in coming decades.\nOne approach, pioneered by a German climate researcher named Stefan Rahmstorf, entails looking at the past relationship between the temperature of the earth and sea level, then making projections. Another, developed by a University of Colorado glaciologist named Tad Pfeffer, involves calculations about how fast the glaciers, if they keep speeding up, might be able to dump ice into the sea.\nThose two methods yield approximately the same answer: that sea level could rise by 2 1/2 to 6 1/2 feet between now and 2100. A developing consensus among climate scientists holds that the best estimate is a little over three feet.\nCalculations about the effect of a three-foot increase suggest that it would cause shoreline erosion to accelerate markedly. In places that once flooded only in a large hurricane, the higher sea would mean that a routine storm could do the trick. In the United States, an estimated 5,000 square miles of dry land and 15,000 square miles of wetlands would be at risk of permanent inundation, though the actual effect would depend on how much money was spent protecting the shoreline.\nThe worst effects, however, would probably occur in areas where land is sinking even as the sea rises. Some of the world\u2019s major cities, especially those built on soft sediments at the mouths of great rivers, are in that situation. In North America, New Orleans is the premier example, with large parts of the city already sitting several feet below sea level.\nDefenses can be built to keep out the sea, of course, like the levees of the New Orleans region and the famed dikes of the Netherlands. But the expense is likely to soar as the ocean rises, and such defenses are not foolproof, as Hurricane Katrina proved.\nStorm surges battering the world\u2019s coastlines every few years would almost certainly force people to flee inland. But it is hard to see where the displaced would go, especially in Asia, where huge cities \u2014 and even entire countries, notably Bangladesh \u2014 are at risk.\nMoreover, scientists point out that if their projections prove accurate, the sea will not stop rising in 2100. By that point, the ice sheets could be undergoing extensive melting.\n\u201cBeyond a hundred years out, it starts to look really challenging,\u201d said Richard B. Alley, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University. \u201cYou start thinking about every coastal city on the planet hiding behind a wall, with storms coming.\u201d\nA Shortage of Satellites\nOne Saturday morning a few months back, a University of Colorado student named Scott Potter, sitting in a control room on the Boulder campus, typed a word into a computer.\n\u201cGO.\u201d\nOver the next 40 seconds, indicators in the control room turned red. Alarms rang. Pagers buzzed. High above the earth, a satellite called ICESat, reacting to Mr. Potter\u2019s order, prepared itself to die.\nThe commotion was expected. Mr. Potter, one of several Colorado students who hold part-time jobs as satellite controllers under professional supervision, was doing the bidding of NASA. His command that day formally ended the ICESat mission, which had produced crucial information about the world\u2019s ice sheets for seven years.\nAt the end of August, two weeks after Mr. Potter sent his order, the remains of ICESat plunged into the Barents Sea, off the Russian coast. Its demise was seen by many climate researchers as a depressing symbol.\nAfter a decade of budget cuts and shifting space priorities in Washington, several satellites vital to monitoring the ice sheets and other aspects of the environment are on their last legs, with no replacements at hand. A replacement for ICESat will not be launched until 2015 at the earliest.\n\u201cWe are slowly going blind in space,\u201d said Robert Bindschadler, a polar researcher at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who spent 30 years with NASA studying ice.\nSeveral federal agencies and two presidential administrations, Democratic and Republican, have made decisions that contributed to the problems.\nFor instance, an attempt by the Clinton and Bush administrations to combine certain military and civilian satellites ate up $5 billion before it was labeled a \u201chorrendous and costly failure\u201d by a Congressional committee.\nA plan by President George W. Bush to return to the moon without allocating substantial new money squeezed budgets at NASA.\nNow, the Obama administration is seeking to chart a new course, abandoning the goal of returning to the moon and seeking a substantial increase in financing for earth sciences. It is also promising an overall strategy for improving the country\u2019s environmental observations.\nMajor elements of the administration\u2019s program won support from both parties on Capitol Hill and were signed into law recently, but amid a larger budget impasse, Congress has not allocated the money President Obama requested.\nIn the meantime, NASA is spending about $15 million a year to fly airplanes over ice sheets and glaciers to gather some information it can no longer get by satellite, and projects are under way in various agencies to plug some of the other information gaps. NASA has begun planning new satellites to replace the ones that are aging.\n\u201cThe missions that are being designed right now are fantastic,\u201d said Tom Wagner, who runs NASA\u2019s ice programs.\nThe satellite difficulties are one symptom of a broader problem: because no scientifically advanced country has made a strategic priority of studying land ice, scientists lack elementary information that they need to make sense of what is happening.\nThey do not know the lay of the land beneath most of the world\u2019s glaciers, including many in Greenland, in sufficient detail to calculate how fast the ice might retreat. They have only haphazard readings of the depth and temperature of the ocean near Greenland, needed to figure out why so much warm water seems to be attacking the ice sheet.\nThe information problems are even more severe in Antarctica. Much of that continent is colder than Greenland, and its ice sheet is believed to be more stable, over all. But in recent years, parts of the ice sheet have started to flow rapidly, raising the possibility that it will destabilize in the same way that much of the world\u2019s other ice has.\nCertain measurements are so spotty for Antarctica that scientists have not been able to figure out whether the continent is losing or gaining ice. Scientists do not have good measurements of the water temperature beneath the massive, floating ice shelves that are helping to buttress certain parts of the ice sheet in West Antarctica. Since the base of the ice sheet sits below sea level in that region, it has long been thought especially vulnerable to a warming ocean.\nBut the cavities beneath ice shelves and floating glaciers are difficult to reach, and scientists said that too little money had been spent to develop technologies that could provide continuing measurements.\nFiguring out whether Antarctica is losing ice over all is essential, because that ice sheet contains enough water to raise global sea level by nearly 200 feet. The parts that appear to be destabilizing contain water sufficient to raise it perhaps 10 feet.\nDaniel Schrag, a Harvard geochemist and head of that university\u2019s Center for the Environment, praised the scientists who do difficult work studying ice, but he added, \u201cThe scale of what they can do, given the resources available, is just completely out of whack with what is required.\u201d\nClimate scientists note that while the science of studying ice may be progressing slowly, the world\u2019s emissions of heat-trapping gases are not. They worry that the way things are going, extensive melting of land ice may become inevitable before political leaders find a way to limit the gases, and before scientists even realize such a point of no return has been passed.\n\u201cThe past clearly shows that sea-level rise is getting faster and faster the warmer it gets,\u201d Dr. Rahmstorf said. \u201cWhy should that process stop? If it gets warmer, ice will melt faster.\u201d",

    "text": "Migrants\u2019 Plight Touches a Point of Swedish Pride\n2010-09-21T00:31:19.000Z\nBRACKE, Sweden \u0097 This land of tall fir trees and spacious lakes is famed for its wild berries: cloudberries, blueberries, lingonberries, gooseberries, raspberries, strawberries and more.\n The problem is, no Swede wants to pick them, except, perhaps, for a couple of handfuls for dessert.\n So a few decades ago, the big companies in Sweden that are among the world\u2019s largest berry processors began importing workers for the laborious task of sweeping the rock-strewn woods and climbing the mountains to find and harvest the berries. The practice of bringing in migrants \u0097 Chinese, Thais, Vietnamese, Bangladeshis \u0097 for the summer berry season seemed to work well, until recent years. \n When a cold snap this spring decimated the berry crop, it punished the industry and its workers with a second straight poor harvest.\n After last year\u2019s disaster, which sent many of the pickers home weighed down with debt rather than profit, the Swedish authorities required the berry companies to guarantee a minimum wage of about $2,320 for the season. To skirt the law, however, the fruit companies in Sweden hired Asian pickers through recruiting companies in their home countries. Since these companies were not Swedish, they were not bound by Swedish law, and they refused to pay their workers the minimum after the crop failed.\nFor Sweden, which prides itself on worker-friendly labor legislation \u0097 and which sent 20 members of a far-right, anti-immigrant party to Parliament in elections last weekend \u0097 the berry pickers quickly became the source of acute national embarrassment, with attention focused particularly on 190 Bangladeshi pickers who arrived in this modest town of pastel wooden homes earlier this year.\n They had been hired in their native land by a company called Bangladesh Work Force, with the promise of a small fortune \u0097 the sums seemed to vary, depending on who did the promising \u0097 if they went to Sweden to pick berries for the summer. Many Bangladeshis put up as much as 150,000 taka, about $2,100, to middlemen at Bangladesh Work Force in a country where a well-paying job as a garment worker brings in about $42 a month, said Mahmudur Rahman, 31, a biotechnology student at Uppsala University whose brother and brother-in-law were among workers who arrived last spring.\n Mr. Rahman said the workers were told they could earn nearly $10,000 in two months, with even lazy pickers pulling in more than $5,000. \nTo earn the full amount, he said they were told, pickers would have to harvest 60 kilograms, about 130 pounds, of berries a day. Given the meager harvest, most of the pickers ended up bringing in as little as 10 pounds, some only a pound or so, meaning they earned little or no money.\n Some took out loans or sold property before coming to Sweden, Mr. Rahman said. \u201cIt was a summer job that went wrong,\u201d he said bitterly.\nIqbal Akhtar, 43, left behind a wife and three children, and was told he could be a cook rather than a berry picker, preparing meals for about 35 men. He was paid the average of what the berry pickers received, which was virtually nothing. \u201cAll in all, it\u2019s been very negative,\u201d he said. To fill their days the men seek odd jobs in town, painting, mowing lawns or working on farms, though little such work is available.\n As summer waned, most of the pickers returned home, helped by local church groups and the Swedish Red Cross. But several dozen remain, housed in four unfurnished homes where they sleep on mattresses on the floor.\nArifur Rahaman, 32, left a wife and son behind in Bangladesh to seek his fortune. On a recent afternoon, he sat drinking a Coke with three friends behind the town\u2019s train station. \u201cNo lingonberries, no money,\u201d he said, lifting empty palms skyward.\n The Nordic Food Group is among Scandinavia\u2019s biggest berry processors. Bertil Qvist, an executive there, said the requirement that companies pay a minimum wage to the berry pickers forced reliance on middlemen in Asia, and he blamed those companies for overstating the money to be made. \n \u201cPeople are invited here on false grounds,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think they are going to pick cultivated berries, and people are not used to the work.\u201d\n In good years, he said, berry pickers can take home a small fortune. \u201cSome years,\u201d he added, \u201cthere\u2019s a bad crop; this year was a bad year.\u201d\n Local people, while agreeing it was a bad year, said the workers were not warned adequately of the possibility. \u201cIt\u2019s like gold in the forest, they\u2019re told, quick money,\u201d said Lars Riberth, pastor of the town church, which has collected the equivalent of $9,000 to help the men.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really slavery,\u201d he said. It was unacceptable, he added, to push the risk onto the pickers\u2019 shoulders.\n Mr. Rahman, the student at Uppsala, said: \u201cSome people made a lot of money, but it\u2019s not the workers.\u201d\n The town\u2019s mayor, Sven-Ake Draxten, 57, a man who likes his Swedish meatballs with a side of lingonberries, noted that local companies that charge the workers for lodging, food and transportation are thriving, while \u201cthe pickers are the losers all the time.\u201d \n\u201cThe government must make new regulations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this situation next year.\u201d\n Thongkam Persson, 57, came to Sweden from her native Thailand 30 years ago, following a Swedish husband. While she now runs a Thai restaurant in town, when she was younger she worked five seasons picking berries. \u201cIt strains your back, and the berries grow on the mountains, so you\u2019re climbing,\u201d she said.\n \u201cThe Swedes have money, so it\u2019s just Thais, Chinese and Vietnamese who pick the berries,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Swedes go hiking in the forest.\u201d",

    "text": "India\u2019s Currency Attracts Investors, but Damages Exports\n2010-10-26T22:13:31.000Z\nCOIMBATORE, India \u0097 As talk of currency battles rumble through the global economy, India has been a reluctant warrior.\nThe reasons are evident here in Coimbatore, a southern city long known as a capital of India\u2019s textile industry, an old-line export trade. Recently, demolition crews razed an abandoned textile mill to make way for the Alliance Mall. \nFrom the ashes of an export industry rises a temple to foreign investment and local consumption. And it is all in keeping with India\u2019s approach to a rising currency.\nThe Indian rupee is soaring \u0097 up 9 percent against the dollar in the last 16 months. That has taken a toll on exports like textiles by making them more expensive on the world market. And the strong rupee poses longer-term threats of overheating the economy. \nBut instead of fighting currency appreciation, as Brazil and some other countries have done, India has been willing to let the rupee rise \u0097 for now, at least.\nIndia is simply too hungry for the foreign capital that is drawn to the strong rupee and is driving it higher, because that influx of money is helping support this country\u2019s approach to developing a modern consumer economy.\nThe Alliance project, with more than a million square feet of retail space, a hotel, offices and condominiums, is being built by an Indian developer with financing from a British retail company and a South African investment firm. \nMeanwhile, the foreign carmakers Volkswagen and Nissan have started their first dealerships, hoping to capitalize on the growing consumer class in this city of about 1.5 million people.\nThe clear losers of India\u2019s currency approach right now are garment makers. From April to August, exports were down 6.4 percent from a year earlier in the $10 billion Indian clothing industry. Although it represents only about 1 percent of the nation\u2019s economy, the garment industry is India\u2019s largest employer after agriculture. \n\u201cAll the other countries are protecting their currencies, so why are we not?\u201d said Premal Udani, chairman of India\u2019s Apparel Export Promotion Council. \n Indian policy makers are eager enough for foreign investment that, for now at least, they are willing to endure the damage a stronger rupee inflicts on exports, especially for lower-value goods like clothes. Exports of other Indian goods and services, like software and pharmaceuticals, have not been as hard hit because they are not as price-sensitive.\nIndia also places a premium on the higher-value jobs that are fueled by foreign investment. Not far from where that old textile mill once stood, the German engineering company Bosch and the American software concern Perot Systems have opened offices in a new technology park.\nThe influx of capital has helped fuel a nearly 9 percent annual growth rate for India\u2019s economy. It has also powered the Indian stock market to near record highs. A big beneficiary of the stock rally has been the government, which is selling shares in state-owned firms like Coal India, the world\u2019s largest coal miner. \nThe government, which has a large budget deficit, plans to raise $9 billion in the current fiscal year from share sales and spend the money on jobs for the rural poor and other welfare programs. A stronger rupee also reduces India\u2019s bill for commodities, like oil, that it needs to import.\n\u201cIf India is to sustain 8 percent growth or 9 percent growth, the only constraint on that can be capital,\u201d said Nikhil Chaturvedi, managing director of Prozone, the Indian real estate firm that is building the Alliance Mall development. \u201cFree flow of capital should be allowed in all sectors\u201d of the economy, he said. \nMr. Chaturvedi, whose joint venture partner in the Alliance Mall is the London-based Capital Shopping Centers, said an appreciating rupee must be tolerated as an unpleasant side effect of the flow of foreign capital.\nIndia\u2019s willingness to let a rising currency stimulate its consumer economy is what many experts say that another emerging giant, China, should be doing \u0097 not only for the good of China\u2019s people but to ease global trade and currency tensions. And yet, while that part of the model might be worth Beijing\u2019s emulating, India in turn can only envy the strength of China\u2019s export juggernaut. \nChina, which has been wary of letting its currency rise too much relative to the dollar, has one of the world\u2019s largest surpluses in its current account \u0097 the broadest measure of a country\u2019s trade and capital flows. India, meanwhile, has the fourth-biggest current-account deficit among the G-20 nations, amounting to 3.1 percent of its gross domestic product. \nThat places India just behind the United States, which has the third-highest deficit, on a side of the trade ledger no vibrant economy aspires to be. \nOver the long term, India needs to pare that deficit and reduce its reliance on foreign capital, which can be fickle. During the recent financial crisis, for example, foreign investors pulled back sharply from India and other emerging markets, helping to temporarily put the brakes on the economy here.\nThe current-account deficit is partly reflected in the declining fortunes of India\u2019s garment exporters. \n About 34 miles east of Coimbatore, in the city of Tiruppur, clothing factory owners and workers say the strong rupee is causing them to lose orders to competitors in China, Bangladesh and other countries that peg their currency to the United States dollar and thus are able to offer much lower-priced clothes to Wal-Mart, H&M and other western buyers.\n M. Sivasubramaniam, the owner of a textile printing factory in Tiruppur, employs about 70 people \u0097 one-third fewer than a year ago. One recent morning, workers trickled into the factory after a long tea break. Their job was to print several varieties of T-shirts, including one with an image of the cartoon character Bart Simpson kicking a soccer ball.\nS. Anand, a print machine operator and the son of a rice farmer, said work was so slow that he was making only about 5,000 rupees ($113) a month, down from 7,000 rupees a year ago when he had the opportunity to work more overtime shifts. But Mr. Anand, who supports a wife and two children, is still better off than many of his co-workers who have lost their jobs. \nThe industry is trying to compensate by focusing on the domestic market and producing more fashionable clothes that command higher prices. But Mr. Udani of the export council said neither effort would quickly offset the decline in exports of mass-market clothes.\nWhatever the Indian government\u2019s strategic motives for letting the rupee rise, it also knows the risks of trying to intervene. \nIn 2007, for instance the country\u2019s central bank tried to stem the currency\u2019s rise by buying dollars and selling rupees. The bank tried to soak up the rupees by issuing bonds. But economists say that the tactic was not entirely successful and that its currency intervention helped stoke domestic inflation. The benchmark wholesale inflation rate hit 11 percent in mid-2008.\nPrices are a big concern again \u0097 wholesale inflation was nearly 9 percent in September \u0097 and policy makers are reluctant to do anything to make it worse, economists say.\nStill, there may be limits to how long the government would stand by if a lot more foreign capital floods into the country and the rupee rises significantly higher. \nIn a recent speech, Duvvuri Subbarao, the central bank\u2019s governor, said the bank would intervene in currency markets if capital flows became \u201clumpy and volatile or if they disrupt the macroeconomic situation.\u201d \n\u201cTwo considerations have guided our policy,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst that, our policy should be as stable as possible without flip-flop moves. Second, our use of controls should be prudent.\u201d\nOfficials could try to balance the need for capital and the concerns of exporters by regulating the flow of money, said Rajiv B. Lall, chief executive of the Infrastructure Development Finance Company in Mumbai. \nThey could force investors to commit investments to longer-term projects, by making it harder to invest in stock and real estate markets, which tend to attract \u201chot money\u201d that flows in and out countries quickly as sentiments change. \nThat would also slow the rise of the rupee, giving exporters time to adapt to a stronger rupee, Mr. Lall said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody would have problem with the appreciation of the rupee over the long term,\u201d Mr. Lall said. The problem is \u201cthe volatility and the mismatch between that and the rest of the economy\u2019s ability to keep adjusting.\u201d",

    "text": "\u2018Burmese Lessons\u2019\n2010-06-11T19:09:44.000Z\nChapter 1: The Dinner Party\nI said that I would find the place myself. I wanted to walk through the city, into Chinatown. \u201cNo, thank you. I do not want a ride, it\u2019s all right.\u201d\nThe pause at the other end of the phone was so long that I thought the line had gone dead.\n\u201cAre you still there?\u201d\nHe asked again, \u201cYou . . . want . . . to walk?\u201d Judging from the hesitating formality of the telephone exchanges we\u2019d had earlier, I\u2019d decided my volunteer guide, San Aung, was over fifty, and a dedicated worrywart.\n\u201cI do want to walk. Please tell me again the name of the restaurant. And how to get there.\u201d\nHe did. He described it all carefully. He said, \u201cBut it can get dark in the evenings. You will be all right alone? I do not want you to get lost.\u201d\nHow dark could it possibly get, in a city? I said, \u201cThere is no possibility that I will get lost.\u201d\nI set off gamely enough. The light coaxes me out of weariness and into intoxicating newness: the tea shop stools, the bottle caps pressed like ancient coins into the hardened mud of the streets, the scowling face of a boy as he pours steaming water into a large pot, then tosses in a load of dirty dishes. As I cross the street, a woman reaches up to a yellow-waterfall tree \u2013 laburnum? \u2013 snaps off a lemony sprig, and tucks it like a bird into her braided hair.\nEven the dirt draws me in, the realness of dirt that lines the edges of millions of flip-flopped feet, including my own, which I wash every evening before I sleep, as I am unable to get into bed with dirty feet, a habit ingrained a decade ago, when I lived with Pee-Moi and Paw Prasert in northern Thailand. It comes flooding back to me in the flood of Rangoon, that early time cascading into this one.\nI experienced a surge of those memories when I first moved back to Thailand six months ago, a vivid unrolling of the past in a small Thai town, my long-ago life with a Thai family. Now I live in the welter and roar of Bangkok, a city I both love and hate for its chaos. At the height of the after-work rush, Rangoon seems much quieter than Bangkok, more manageable, less noisy. Though noisy enough. The glorious disorder slowly organizes itself into the busy face of evening. Where at first I moved, dazed and jostled, in a thick crowd of bodies, now I float from one stream of rushing humans to another. Young office men with soft faces, housewives confounded by the price of chicken, students who glimmer with intelligence. On Anawrahta Street, small-time salesmen with slicked-back hair have spread their wares \u2013 nail clippers, small electronic gizmos, hand mirrors, ballpoint pens, sunglasses, bottles of cologne and loads of used clothes, much of it smuggled in from Thailand or Bangladesh, since Burma produces very little \u2013 on swaths of the wide sidewalk.\nOne of these salesmen, white-suited and handsome, like a Burmese version of an Italian gangster, is picking his nose when he meets my inquisitive eyes. He smiles at me unabashedly. Women walk home with their baskets of greens and onions, and other women stride in the opposite direction, toward the river and the boats that will ferry them across it. Four young Indian children in their pyjamas, their eyes kohled and their cheeks swirled with thanaka, play a checkers-like game on a set of broad steps. Normally I would stop to watch, but I must not be late for dinner.\nHere is Chinatown, with its blue and green buildings, wooden shutters and elegant roofs, looking romantic in the gold leaf of dusk. The paint on the buildings is new, thin and lime-based, making the whitewashing both literal and figurative. The State Law and Order Restoration Council recently decreed it for all the buildings of Rangoon. Not so long ago, the SLORC also forcibly moved entire communities of the city\u2019s poorest people into primitive shantytowns on the periphery of the city so that foreign visitors like myself are not burdened with the sight of them.\nDarkness falls quickly, as it does in the tropics, and falls hard, as it does in Rangoon, because none of the lights on these streets are working. I take a moment to get my bearings and consult my map, which happens to have several errors on it \u2013 that is, if I\u2019m reading it correctly. Soon I am rushing around in the dark, flustered and big-eyed and without composure, approaching and retreating from the wrong pools of light and people, my glasses slipping down my nose.\nBut I do find my dinner party, finally, when San Aung sees a woman stumbling by on the broken pavement and calls out, \u201cMiss Karen,\u201d accent on the second syllable, Ka ren, like the ethnic group that has been at war with the Burmese military for half a century. I approach the table, smiling and sweating in equal measure as I greet everyone, a dozen or so dinner guests gathered together by San Aung, who is not in his fifties at all but is a good-looking man of perhaps thirty-five with high cheekbones in a long Indian face. With his gorgeous head of gleaming hair and his immaculate clothes, he looks like a movie star. He wears a blue pinstriped shirt and a dark blue longyi; both seem to have been lifted off an ironing board five minutes ago. He shakes my hand three times, then lets go and turns to introduce me to the others, giving me condensed biographies as we make our way around the table of mostly Burmese writers. But a lawyer is also here, and a history professor who works at the Japanese embassy (the pay is much better, the university is a shambles), a burly ship\u2019s captain who loves Gorky \u2013 he announces this immediately, as an intellectual credential \u2013 a woman who collects Burmese folk tales, and a Swedish journalist, Anita. Even though she\u2019s sitting down, I can tell that she is very tall.\nPlates of food are already arriving, heaps of greens and noodles and two whole fishes. And a pile of twisted, glistening stuff: very possibly a platter of silver worms. The ship\u2019s captain and a very rotund poet make a place for me between them and, once I\u2019m seated, the introductory quiet closes up with voices again, like steady waves after a lull. Streams of Burmese rush around me, and English strides out into the air, directed to Anita, the journalist, to myself, and to a man I\u2019d assumed was part of the local contingent but who is, in fact, Johnny, a Filipino photographer employed by Time magazine.\nEveryone talks about books and writers, passing the names back and forth like gem dealers handling sapphires and rubies, marvelling at the riches. Though at the mention of Tolstoy and Anna Karenina, San Aung pushes out his bottom lip in contemptuous-Frenchman style and huffs, \u201cBut it was too much, all those characters. I couldn\u2019t keep them straight. There were too many of them at the beginning and too many at the end.\u201d He laughs. \u201cI did not read the middle, but I\u2019m sure it was the same problem.\u201d\nThe ship\u2019s captain, clearly a great admirer of the old Russian writers, is scandalized. \u201cBut that is how Tolstoy . . .\u201d He looks at me, open-mouthed, searching for the word on my white face. Apparently, he finds it. \u201cThat is how Tolstoy re-creates the world. He fills his books with real human beings. Yes, there are many of them; Russia is a big country! And all different kinds of people live in his work, not just one class or another class.\u201d\nIs he really a ship\u2019s captain? He talks like a professor. I tell him, \u201cListening to you makes me want to be a writer.\u201d\nHe replies in a tone close to reverence, \u201cYou already are a writer. How fortunate!\u201d\n\u201cBut writing is hard work. And lonely. There may be a lot of characters in a story or a book, but the writer is always alone with them.\u201d I look around the table. \u201cAnd there\u2019s never enough money.\u201d\nMy fellow writers at the table nod their agreement. But I know that none of them are spoiled as I am spoiled: by early success, by government grants and, most abundantly, by freedom. Yet still I complain. In Burma! It\u2019s disgusting.\nLately I\u2019ve found my enthusiasm for my calling on the wane, partly because I know I\u2019m stuck with it. Most of my life will be spent in a room in front of a computer, tapping out the visions in my head, reworking handwritten scrawls. This notion once filled me with delight. Now it just makes me want to get out of the room and meet someone for a drink \u2013 preferably someone who looks like San Aung.\nHowever \u2013 the captain is right. Tolstoy has been dead for one hundred years, yet Anna Karenina is alive and beloved in Rangoon. It is extraordinary that something so still, so lifeless \u2013 black type on the cheap paper of Penguin\u2019s classic pocketbook \u2013 can contain a living world. A Burmese man can step into a time machine and go to nineteenth-century Russia just by turning one page, then another, and another, until he is entangled emotionally and intellectually in fictional lives. Strangers become his familiars.\nI look around the table at the animated faces. Tall Anita is flushed, the tip of her nose red; did she eat a chili? The folk tale collector talks across the table to the lawyer, who nods and grunts every few sentences (ah, I know it well, the Asian male grunt \u2013 so expressive, so full of feeling!) to show her that he\u2019s listening. He also stares, as I do, at the woman\u2019s plump mauve mouth. I wonder if she is married. Or if he is. Possibly they are married to each other.\nGood travel is like good reading: you go inside a new world and cannot resist it. This will implicate me, I think, chopsticking a load of delicious oily noodles into my mouth. I love eating with strangers. Nothing but sex brings people together so quickly; dining is usually more friendly and lasts longer. People are still chatting, but the steamed fish has displaced the miracle of Tolstoy. Under a gloss of sweet sauce and dark skin is delicious white flesh, fat flakes of it without too many bones.\nThe poet spoons a tangle of worms onto my plate. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he says, his voice reminiscent of Tom Waits\u2019s, a rough engine idling the vocal cords. \u201cThis is the custom. You have not tasted this yet. Delicious. We make sure you eat. I still do this for my daughter.\u201d He means placing the finest morsels of food on her plate, feeding her. When he smiles, his narrow eyes sink into folds of heavy eyelid. He has great bulldog jowls, too, a wide, lumpy nose, and a few dribbles of a previous meal staining his shirt. He smells like a tea shop during the early morning rush: earthy and smoky and surprisingly sweet, as though he has an Indian pastry in his breast pocket. He has not stopped smoking his cheroot since I arrived. Many Burmese people are beautiful. If not truly endowed with good looks, they have the straight-backed, slender grace that passes as beauty. Therefore it is refreshing, even reassuring, to meet this man.\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry, but can you tell me your name again?\u201d\n\u201cI am Tin Moe,\u201d he answers.\nAnd now I recognize him. Sayagyi \u2013 the great teacher \u2013 Tin Moe, the famous, beloved poet laureate of Burma, imprisoned for five years because of his writings and his support for the National League for Democracy, the political party headed by Aung San Suu Kyi. He was on a list of imprisoned Burmese writers that PEN published a couple of years ago. Ma Thida, a young woman writer, was on the same list. Tin Moe was released; Ma Thida is still in prison.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so good to meet you, U Tin Moe. I\u2019m honoured to be sitting with people who love books so much. And with such a famous poet! I didn\u2019t expect to be so lucky on my first trip to Burma.\u201d\n\u201cOh, thank you, thank you. It is our pleasure.\u201d He motions toward my plate with his chin. \u201cYour eels will be cold, Miss Karen. Please eat them.\u201d\n\u201cThose are eels?\u201d\nThe captain, who has been listening to every word, interjects, \u201cBabies.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Poor things! They are salty, faintly crablike, and sublime.\nMy fellow diners have started talking about writers again: Havel, Kundera, Faulkner, have I read them, and do I like Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, and why, and who else have I read, who is my favourite writer? Someone makes the joke that M\u00e1rquez, in One Hundred Years of Solitude, was competing with Tolstoy for the greatest number of characters, to which San Aung responds sharply, \u201cThat\u2019s another novel I could not read. Life is too short.\u201d Then he asks my opinion about several Swedish authors. I have to admit that I\u2019ve never read them.\nThe hunger for books is greater than the hunger for food, though there is no doubt that the conversation is enhanced by the meal. When the waiter brings new dishes, of prawns, a broccoli-like green stir-fried with garlic and ginger, and spicy eggplant, new discussions arise with the fragrant steam. We eat and talk, turning to each other as we swallow, laughing often, over many comments and turns in the conversation, our voices growing louder and louder, until Sayagyi Tin Moe says, \u201cIt\u2019s very good, to talk about all these books, these writers.\u201d His eyes shine. \u201cBut this talk makes me think of all the books that Burmese people cannot read.\u201d He heaves a sigh and picks up his cheroot again. He scrabbles in his breast pockets for a lighter. \u201cSo many of our own books are banned now. Many names cannot be printed. Her name. No one is allowed to publish her name.\u201d\nThe table has fallen silent and we attend him, respectfully, knowing who the unnamed woman is. His time in prison had as much to do with his unequivocal support of Aung San Suu Kyi as it did with his writing.\n\u201cDid you know\u201d \u2013 he turns to me \u2013 \u201cthat each new book a writer produces here must be copied out four times and given to four different censors? For a Burmese writer, that is a great expense. Then each censor puts lines through any offending passages. After that, the manuscript has to be rewritten without those passages. This is not the way any normal writer likes to write. It\u2019s the way the censors like to write. One of my friends, a popular novelist, not a political writer, had to write her last book five times. It almost drove her crazy. But she had to do it. She wants to write her books. She doesn\u2019t want to go to jail and get tuberculosis.\u201d\n\u201cLike Ma Thida,\u201d I say in a low tone.\n\u201cDo you know her?\u201d\n\u201cI know of her. One of the reasons I\u2019ve come here is to find out more about her. I do some work for a group in Canada that has made Ma Thida an honorary member, and we\u2019re lobbying the Burmese government for her release.\u201d\nContinues...",

    "text": "Asian Migrant Workers See Exploitation in Sweden\n2010-09-07T20:01:40.000Z\nThe image of migrant workers freezing, locking up their bosses and marching for better pay and conditions is not typically Swedish. \nYet these are among the catalog of incidents that have occurred among Asian workers spending the season picking wild berries in the forests of central and northern Sweden. \nThey are occurring, union officials and aid workers say, mainly because collective bargaining rules, implemented recently, are proving difficult to enforce, and because of what appears to be exploitation by employment agencies based in Asia. The government is monitoring the situation and says it may adapt its rules. \nIn some cases, humanitarian agencies, local authorities and churches have stepped in to help stranded and precarious workers. \nYlva de Val-Olsson, a Red Cross coordinator, said her organization intervened after discovering in late August that 138 Bangladeshi pickers were crammed into four squalid houses in Bracke, in central Sweden. The accommodation lacked functioning toilets and the workers had inadequate clothing, shoes and blankets for night temperatures, just above freezing. \n\u201cWe\u2019re used to helping people abroad,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s very seldom that we have an acute situation like this in Sweden.\u201d \nSome of the Bangladeshis have gone home, but many remain and want to stay and pick berries, to cover their debts. \u201cThey thought they would get a lifetime\u2019s income, but it\u2019s the opposite,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad.\u201d \nOther incidents reported by the Swedish media last month include strikes and sit-ins by Vietnamese and Chinese pickers protesting conditions. In one case, Vietnamese pickers locked up and reportedly assaulted their team leaders in a school, while 100 Chinese workers staged an overnight march to protest salaries and conditions, walking 15 kilometers, or 9 miles. Vietnamese berry pickers in Saran, in central Sweden, were reportedly shooting birds with catapults for food. \nConsidered a delicacy by Swedes, berries are eaten fresh or preserved on breakfast cereal and used to make jam, cakes, juice and infusions. \nLaws giving the public a right of access allow people to roam forests gathering wild berries with few limits. But the practice has evolved from bucolic pastime into big business. \nWild berries are especially rich in vitamins and prized by food retailers, and by pharmaceutical companies for their antioxidant qualities. Their pigments can be used for coloring cosmetics, pharmaceutical syrups and nutritional supplements.\nIn Sweden and Finland, over 30,000 tons are gathered each season, according to Polarica, the largest producer there. The most important are cloudberries, gathered in late July; blueberries, in August; and lingonberries, in September. Large quantities are also gathered in Poland, the Baltic States, Russia and Belarus. \nAnd much like fruit picking in France and Spain, low wages and tough conditions dissuade locals \u2014 in this case crouching and tramping through damp, mosquito-infested forests. \nIn Sweden, the labor has primarily come from East Asian countries. In Finland, migrant Ukrainians have found themselves in a similarly precarious situation in recent years. \nOfficially, there are about 4,000 Asian workers in Sweden with permits this year. But the real number is higher, because many enter on tourist visas. Last year, official numbers were several thousand higher, though a poor harvest may have deterred some. \nAfter pressure from unions, pressure groups and public unease, the government has acted. In March, the Migration Board said that it would start handling permit applications for pickers in the same way as for other work permit applications for people who are not citizens in the European Union. Previously, pickers had entered on tourist visas, working casually. \nThe head of the board\u2019s work permit unit, Alejandro Firpo, said his agency issued permits of varying duration but had a very limited authority to follow up on abuses, which is a matter for unions, employers and workers.\nAt the same time, the Swedish Municipal Workers Union, Kommunal, has won the right to organize and establish collective agreements for pickers. These include a monthly minimum wage of 16,372 kronor, or $2,240, for pickers employed by companies operating in Sweden and slightly more for those employed by staff agencies abroad. \nHans Kotzan, Kommunal\u2019s international secretary, said the problems appeared to be continuing because many pickers were still not covered by the agreements. Kommunal has deals with about 15 or 20 major companies, but Mr. Kotzan said \u201cthe lack of agreements\u201d across the sector \u201cis lowering standards.\u201d \nWhere the pickers are not covered, the union cannot intervene. That appears to be the case for many of those recruited by agencies in Asia. \nKommunal says it is trying to work with regional and global union federations representing food workers to establish better supervision.\n\u201cSomebody has to pay a price for the cheap berries,\u201d Mr. Kotzan said. \u201cUnfortunately it\u2019s the laborers.\u201d \nTommy Innala, Polarica\u2019s chief executive, said his company had agreed to a code to ensure that its agents and distributors are socially responsible, pay fair wages and monitor conditions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for our future,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a clean industry. If not, people won\u2019t trust us, and we\u2019ll die.\u201d\nHe said there was still work to do to \u201cbuild a win-win system.\u201d \nIn the meantime, the issue has risen up the political agenda, with some lawmakers calling for the government to act again. \nMarkus Friberg, a spokesman for the minister for migration and employment, said the government had initiated information campaigns through embassies in East Asia and was \u201cclosely following developments.\u201d \n\u201cWe are now in the middle of the season \u2014 we\u2019ll see if we have to do something\u201d after the season ends in October, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for the government to act on contracts signed abroad.\u201d ",

    "text": "At Hospitals, New Methods With a Focus on Diversity\n2010-09-07T00:14:57.000Z\nAt Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, a borough that is home to 2.3 million people from more than 100 countries, lactation consultants spend extra time explaining to Bangladeshi women that the yellow breast milk they produce right after birth is not dirty.\nFemale obstetricians are always on duty overnight at the hospital\u2019s maternity ward in case a Muslim woman arrives in labor and does not want to be treated by a male doctor. \nAt the diabetes nutrition classes, where participants are mostly from Latin America, diet plans incorporate items like guava paste, plantains and chayote squash.\nRuth Rooney, a registered nurse who has been running the classes for 15 years, said she had struggled to figure out why blood sugar levels among her Latino patients remained so high. So one day she asked them to bring in samples of the foods they ate at home.\n\u201cI realized I had been telling them to avoid white bread,\u201d Ms. Rooney said, \u201cbut I never mentioned tortillas, which is really a staple of their diet.\u201d \nAs more immigrants crowd its waiting rooms, Elmhurst Hospital is joining a growing number of hospitals in New York and across the country that are going beyond hiring interpreters and offering translated paperwork and are adopting practices intended to improve care for an increasingly diverse patient population.\nDoctors and nurses are interviewing religious leaders, visiting cultural centers and even traveling abroad to better understand their patients. \nThe lessons are redefining traditional notions of health care not just in immigrant hubs like New York, California and Texas, but also in places like Storm Lake, Iowa, a city of 12,000 that has been transformed by an influx of Hispanics who work in the area\u2019s meatpacking plants. \n\u201cWe can\u2019t just say, \u2018You\u2019re different,\u2019 call an interpreter and consider our job done,\u201d said Candi Castleberry-Singleton, chief diversity officer at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which operates 15 hospitals and clinics throughout Pennsylvania. \u201cWhat we have to say is, whatever cultural beliefs you have, they\u2019re going to be acknowledged and respected.\u201d\nAt Mercy Medical Center in Merced, Calif., shamans tend to the spiritual needs of the hospital\u2019s many Hmong patients. Memorial Hermann Southwest Hospital in Houston has a floor devoted to Asian patients, where the menu offers a selection of Chinese and Vietnamese comfort food, like chicken congee soup and steamed dumplings.\nIn Harlem, the Medina Clinic opened in May 2009 inside Harlem Hospital Center to cater to the many West African immigrants arriving in the neighborhood. Since many immigrants are devout Muslims, the clinic provides a prayer space. Medical appointments can last an hour or more because many patients with limited or no access to health care in their home countries often have chronic illnesses, like heart disease or diabetes, said Dr. John M. Palmer, executive director of Harlem Hospital.\nThe doctors at the clinic have seen more than 700 patients since it opened, providing treatment and helping them navigate an unfamiliar and complex health care system. Patients with no insurance often miss follow-up appointments, believing they will be asked to pay for something they cannot afford. \n\u201cIt takes them time to get the idea of pay scales and subsidized care,\u201d Dr. Palmer said.\nFinding ways to make immigrants feel more at ease is not just a good-faith effort at cultural sensitivity but can also translate into improved health outcomes, health care providers say. Patients who trust their doctors are less likely to end up in emergency rooms because they have waited too long to deal with an ailment. And the emotional difficulties often experienced by patients recovering from surgery or extended hospital stays can be made more palatable. \nSome hospitals, for example, place no restrictions on visiting hours to accommodate the varied work schedules of many immigrants. \n\u201cOne thing you don\u2019t learn in medical school is how to interpret cultural cues, but they\u2019re key when you\u2019re dealing with a diverse population,\u201d said Dr. Braden Hexom, who works in the emergency room at Elmhurst Hospital. \nTodd Hudspeth, the chief executive of Buena Vista Regional Medical Center in Storm Lake, which has the most diverse public school system in Iowa, knew he had a problem when he started getting complaints about his hospital from Mexican and Central American immigrants at a Spanish Mass he attended a few years ago.\nThe hospital had no interpreters and no Spanish speakers on its staff, Mr. Hudspeth said. \nSo he took several doctors and nurses with him on a trip to Mexico in 2004 to learn about the health care system; some of the hospital\u2019s doctors have made repeated visits. The hospital also created a training program that covers attitudes among people from Mexico and Central America toward issues like birth, illness, dying and death. \n\u201cA lot of it is just raising people\u2019s awareness that not everybody does things the way we do in the Midwest,\u201d Mr. Hudspeth said. \nThe accommodations hospitals make can be subtle but meaningful. At a hospital that is part of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, a Muslim woman admitted for gastric bypass surgery a few months ago was placed in a bed facing east so she would be in the proper direction during her daily prayers. \nMercy Medical Center in California has banished pens with red ink from patient rooms because some Hmong believe the color red is a sign that a person has been cursed, said Robert C. Streeter, vice president of medical affairs for the hospital. \nIn the neighborhoods surrounding Elmhurst Hospital, including Jackson Heights, Corona and Elmhurst, 56 percent of the residents are foreign-born, according to the city\u2019s health department. \nTo better understand patient attitudes, lactation consultants at the hospital surveyed new mothers last year to figure out what women from different countries thought about breast-feeding. They asked, among other things, whether they knew the importance of their first milk, which is called colostrum, and if breast-feeding was promoted in their native country. \nThey found out that in Bangladesh colostrum is considered impure and is usually discarded and that Bangladeshi women had no idea that it is, in fact, highly nutritious. Chinese women planning to send their children to be raised their first few years by relatives in China, a common practice, will not breast-feed. And though breast-feeding is common in rural Mexico, Mexican women here are often eager to give their babies formula.\n\u201cThey come across the border, they see bottles and they think, \u2018That\u2019s American, that\u2019s the way to go.\u2019 It\u2019s kind of a status thing,\u201d said Patricia de Lima, director of a breast-feeding initiative at Elmhurst.\nThe survey helped shape the way lactation consultants approach mothers from different countries. In much the same way, Ms. Rooney, the nurse who runs the diabetes classes, adjusted the diets of her immigrant patients after reviewing the food they ate at home.\nDr. Jasmin Moshirpur recalled how different it was when she started working at Elmhurst Hospital 40 years ago, as the sole female obstetrician-gynecologist on the staff. \nThe issue of treating immigrants goes well beyond the challenges posed by linguistic diversity, said Dr. Moshirpur, regional director of the Queens Health Network, which includes Elmhurst Hospital. The very notion of health differs depending on where a patient is from.\n\u201cA good part of the mentality is still to provide what our patients need,\u201d she said. \u201cHealth needs come first, of course, but there\u2019s no question we can be better doctors if we\u2019re also mindful of patients\u2019 cultural needs.\u201d",

    "text": "Migrant Berry Pickers Complain of Conditions in Sweden\n2010-09-07T19:39:20.000Z\nThe image of migrant workers freezing, living in squalor or demanding better pay and conditions is not typical in Sweden.\nYet these are among the cases involving Asian workers who are spending the season picking wild berries in the forests of central and northern Sweden.\nThey are occurring, union officials and aid workers say, mainly because collective bargaining rules are proving difficult to enforce and because of what appears to be exploitation by employment agencies based in Asia. The Swedish government is monitoring the situation and says it may adapt its rules, which were recently put in place.\nIn some cases, humanitarian agencies, local authorities and churches have stepped in to help the workers.\nYlva de Val Olsson, a Red Cross coordinator, said her organization had intervened after discovering in August that 138 pickers from Bangladesh were crammed into four squalid houses in Bracke, in central Sweden. The accommodations lacked functioning toilets and the workers had inadequate clothing, shoes and blankets for night temperatures just above freezing.\n\u201cWe\u2019re used to helping people abroad,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s very seldom that we have an acute situation like this in Sweden.\u201d\nSome of the Bangladeshis have gone home, but many remain and want to stay and pick berries to cover their debts. \u201cThey thought they would get a lifetime\u2019s income, but it\u2019s the opposite,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad.\u201d\nThe Swedish media has reported actions by workers, including strikes and sit-ins by Vietnamese and Chinese pickers. In one case, Vietnamese pickers locked up and reportedly assaulted their team leaders in a school, while 100 Chinese workers staged a nine-mile overnight march to protest salaries and conditions. Vietnamese berry pickers elsewhere in Sweden were reportedly shooting birds with catapults for food.\nLaws giving the public a right of access allow people to roam forests gathering wild berries with few limits. But the practice has evolved from a bucolic pastime into big business.\nWild berries are especially rich in vitamins and prized by food retailers, and by pharmaceutical companies for their antioxidant qualities. Their pigments can be used for coloring cosmetics, pharmaceutical syrups and nutritional supplements.\nIn Sweden and neighboring Finland, over 30,000 tons are gathered each season, according to Polarica, the largest producer there. The most important are cloudberries, gathered in late July; blueberries, in August; and lingonberries, in September. Large quantities are also gathered in Poland, the Baltic states, Russia and Belarus.\nAnd much like fruit-picking in France and Spain, low wages and tough conditions \u0097 in this case crouching and tramping through damp, mosquito-infested forests \u0097 dissuade native workers.\nIn Sweden, the labor has primarily come from East Asian countries. In Finland, migrant Ukrainians have found themselves in similarly precarious situations in recent years.\nOfficially, there are about 4,000 Asian workers in Sweden with permits this year. But the real number is higher, because many enter on tourist visas. Last year, official numbers were several thousand higher, though a poor harvest may have deterred some.\nAfter pressure from unions and public unease, the government has acted. In March, the Migration Board said that it would start handling permit applications for pickers in the same way as for other work permit applications for people who are not citizens in the European Union.\nThe head of the board\u2019s work permit unit, Alejandro Firpo, said his agency issued permits of varying duration but had a very limited authority to follow up on abuses, which was a matter for unions, employers and workers.\nAt the same time, the Swedish Municipal Workers Union, Kommunal, has won the right to organize and establish collective agreements for pickers. These include a monthly minimum wage of 16,372 kronor, or about $2,240, for pickers employed by companies operating in Sweden and slightly more for those employed by staff agencies abroad.\nHans Kotzan, Kommunal\u2019s international secretary, said the problems appeared to be continuing because many pickers were still not covered by the agreements. Kommunal has deals with about 15 to 20 major companies, but Mr. Kotzan said \u201cthe lack of agreements\u201d across the sector was \u201clowering standards.\u201d\nWhere the pickers are not covered, the union cannot intervene. That appears to be the case for many of those recruited by agencies in Asia.\nKommunal says it is trying to work with regional and global union federations representing food workers to establish better supervision.\n\u201cSomebody has to pay a price for the cheap berries,\u201d Mr. Kotzan said. \u201cUnfortunately it\u2019s the laborers.\u201d",

    "text": "Maurice J. Williams, Directed United Nations Food Aid, Dies at 89\n2010-05-25T17:19:41.000Z\nMaurice J. Williams, who coordinated American disaster-relief efforts and then led a United Nations agency dedicated to relieving world hunger while warning repeatedly that not enough was being done to achieve that goal, died on May 10 in Bethesda, Md. He was 89 and lived in St. Petersburg, Fla.\nThe cause was complications from a fall, his son Jon said.\nMr. Williams, an expert in international development policy, was director of the United Nations Food Council from 1978 to 1986. An arm of the General Assembly, the agency was established in 1974 to coordinate food programs of other United Nations agencies and national governments. Under Mr. Williams, the council concentrated on helping developing countries formulate strategies for food production, nutrition and disaster preparation.\nThe council was formed shortly after the first World Food Conference was held in Rome. That meeting, at a time when famine was threatening swaths of Africa and Asia, led to a United Nations pledge to eradicate hunger and malnutrition.\n Five years later, although the sense of global crisis had dissipated because of improved crop yields, Mr. Williams warned, \u201cIt is not possible to be optimistic or complacent in the face of evidence which indicates that there are probably more hungry and malnourished people in 1979 than the 450 million to whom the 1974 conference directed its attention.\u201d\nMr. Williams was no less concerned in 1984. \u201cThere is still famine in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d he said then. \u201cYou still have hungry people on marginal land in parts of Asia and Latin America. In the slums of their cities people still go to bed hungry every night, unable to earn enough to buy food that is available.\u201d \nMr. Williams retired from the World Food Council in 1986; 10 years later its functions were taken over by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Program. \nHis leadership of the council was the culmination of nearly four decades of public service, including many missions abroad during famines and other disasters. \nMr. Williams was an international economist with the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency in the 1950s. He was director of the United States Agency for International Development\u2019s aid programs in Iran and Pakistan from 1963 to 1967 and deputy administrator of the agency from 1970 to 1974.\nWhen an earthquake devastated much of Managua, Nicaragua, in December 1972, President Richard M. Nixon sent Mr. Williams to administer American aid efforts there. He had previously coordinated American disaster relief in Peru, the Philippines, six drought-stricken West African countries and for the newly independent Bangladesh after the India-Pakistan war in 1971. \nMaurice Jacoutot Williams was born in New Brunswick, Canada, on Nov. 13, 1920, one of two children of Alfred and Yvonne Theberge Williams. His father, an American citizen, was a salesman.\nMr. Williams\u2019s studies at Northwestern University were interrupted by World War II. Stationed in London from 1943 to 1946, he rose to captain in the Army. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree from Northwestern after the war and went on to earn a master\u2019s degree in economics from the University of Chicago in 1949. \nBesides his son Jon, Mr. Williams is survived by his second wife, Joan Dunn Williams; two other sons, Peter and Stephen; four grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. His first wife, the former Betty Bath, died in 2005.",

    "text": "In California, a Step Toward B.Y.O.B. (Bring Your Own Bag)\n2010-06-03T02:35:36.000Z\nSAN FRANCISCO \u0097 Paper or plastic? Neither. \nThe bagging options for store clerks could be severely limited after Wednesday\u2019s vote in the California State Assembly to not only ban plastic bags from pharmacies, groceries, convenience stores and liquor stores, but also to make retailers charge at least a nickel for paper bags \u0097 which must include recyclable content. \nThe goal is to prompt 21st-century shoppers in California to do what 20th-century shoppers in Moscow did routinely \u0097 keep an avoska, or reusable sack, at the ready. China and Bangladesh already have plastic bag bans in place, and the United Nations has called for the bans to go global.\nIn the United States, California has gone further toward an overall ban than any other state, although North Carolina has banned plastic bags on the islands of its Outer Banks. However, approval in California\u2019s Senate is far from certain. \nBut with new support from the state\u2019s grocery store lobby \u0097 which wants a uniform statewide policy \u0097 and no active opposition from conservative power centers like the Chamber of Commerce, no one is willing to count out Assemblywoman Julia Brownley\u2019s assault on the plastic bags she calls \u201curban tumbleweed.\u201d \n\u201cThey\u2019re not only on beaches,\u201d said Ms. Brownley, a Democrat from Santa Monica who sponsored the measure, which squeaked through the Assembly with just the 41 votes needed. \u201cYou look in trees and there they are. You look in fences and they\u2019re stuck in there. In storm drains after a big rain you see plastic bag goop, is what you see.\u201d \nIn 2007, San Francisco became the first city in the country to ban plastic bags. While plastic bags are associated with litter, ocean-borne waste and harm to marine mammals that ingest them or become entangled in them, paper bags have their own environmental issues. They are associated with the loss of forests and their potential to absorb greenhouse gases.\nBut efforts to ban plastic grocery bags from Oakland to Manhattan Beach have fallen afoul of state court rulings mandating an environmental-impact review. Nonetheless, at least 20 localities have enacted bag restrictions, or are considering them.\nThis multiplicity of local laws prompted the California Grocers\u2019 Association, which counts retailers like Safeway, Trader Joe\u2019s, Costco, Whole Foods and 7-Eleven among its members, to seek the kind of uniformity the Brownley bill offered. The American Chemistry Council, however, remains opposed. \u201cThe last thing California consumers need right now is to have what amounts to a $1 billion tax added to their grocery bills,\u201d the group\u2019s senior director, Tim Shestek, said in a statement. He added, \u201cIt\u2019s astounding to think the Legislature is seriously considering creating a new $1 million bureaucracy to monitor how people choose to pack their groceries.\u201d \nSome 19 billion bags a year are used in California alone; Ms. Brownley\u2019s fact sheet said the state spends $25 million annually to collect and bury a portion of them.\n\u201cWe in the United States created the plastic bag and it proliferated throughout Europe and throughout the world,\u201d Ms. Brownley said. \u201cIf Bangladesh can ban plastic bags and see the environmental impact of it, I can\u2019t see why California can\u2019t.\u201d ",

    "text": "Maternal Health: A New Study Challenges Benefits of Vitamin A for Women and Babies\n2010-05-03T20:06:56.000Z\nGiving women vitamin A capsules did not save their lives or the lives of their new babies, according to a surprising new study from Ghana reported this week by the medical journal Lancet.\n The results contradicted an earlier study in Nepal that showed a huge drop in deaths among child-bearing women taking vitamin A, and disappointed experts who hoped pills could be a cheap, easy lifesaver. Scientists did establish in the 1980s that giving vitamin A to malnourished children prevented stunting and deaths from measles and diarrhea.\n The 1999 study in Nepal suggested the vitamin also saved young mothers, although that result was regarded somewhat skeptically because so many of the women had died of unrelated causes, including burns, drowning, snakebite and hanging. \n Writing in a Lancet commentary, Anthony Costello and David Osrin of the global health institute of University College London noted that the new study recruited an \u201castonishing\u201d number of women \u2014 nearly 208,000 in more than 1,000 villages or family compounds. \n Half got a weekly low dose of vitamin A, and half got a placebo. Few in either group died, but the vitamin also did not reduce hospitalization for childbirth complications. Nor did it reduce stillbirths or deaths of newborns. Recent trials in Bangladesh and Indonesia had similar results.\n Finding ways to get more food to young women might be more effective than getting them vitamin pills, the commentary\u2019s authors said.

    "text": "Imam\u2019s Path From Condemning Terror to Preaching Jihad\n2010-05-08T21:11:51.000Z\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In the weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks, the eloquent 30-year-old imam of a mosque outside Washington became a go-to Muslim cleric for reporters scrambling to explain Islam. He condemned the mass murder, invited television crews to follow him around and patiently explained the rituals of his religion.\n\u201cWe came here to build, not to destroy,\u201d the cleric, Anwar al-Awlaki, said in a sermon. \u201cWe are the bridge between Americans and one billion Muslims worldwide.\u201d\nAt first glance, it seemed plausible that this lanky, ambitious man, with the scholarly wire-rims and equal command of English and Arabic, could indeed be such a bridge. CD sets of his engaging lectures on the Prophet Muhammad were in thousands of Muslim homes. American-born, he had a sense of humor, loved deep-sea fishing, had dabbled in get-rich-quick investment schemes and dropped references to \u201cJoe Sixpack\u201d into his sermons. A few weeks before the attacks he had preached in the United States Capitol.\nNine years later, from his hide-out in Yemen, Mr. Awlaki has declared war on the United States.\n \u201cAmerica as a whole has turned into a nation of evil,\u201d he said in a statement posted on extremist Web sites in March. Though he had spent 21 of his 39 years in the United States, he added, \u201cI eventually came to the conclusion that jihad against America is binding upon myself, just as it is binding on every other able Muslim.\u201d\n His mix of scripture and vitriol has helped lure young Muslims into a dozen plots. He cheered on the Fort Hood gunman and had a role in prompting the attempted airliner bombing on Dec. 25, intelligence officials say. And last week, Faisal Shahzad, who is charged in the attempted bombing in Times Square, told investigators that Mr. Awlaki\u2019s prolific online lectures urging jihad as a religious duty helped inspire him to act.\nAt a time of new concern about the attraction of Western Muslims to violent extremism, there is no figure more central than Mr. Awlaki, who has harnessed the Internet for the goals of Al Qaeda. Counterterrorism officials are gravely concerned about his powerful appeal for many others who are following his path to radicalization.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a magnetic character,\u201d said Philip Mudd, a veteran of the C.I.A.\u2019s Counterterrorism Center who just stepped down after nearly five years as a top F.B.I. intelligence adviser. \u201cHe\u2019s a powerful orator in a revolutionary movement.\u201d \nConvinced that he is a lethal threat, the United States government has responded in kind. This year Mr. Awlaki became the first American citizen on the C.I.A.\u2019s list of terrorists approved as a target for killing, a designation that has only enhanced his status with admirers like Shahidur Rahman, 27, a British Muslim of Bangladeshi descent who studied with Mr. Awlaki in London in 2003.\nOther clerics equivocated about whether terrorist violence could be reconciled with Islam, Mr. Rahman said, but even seven years ago Mr. Awlaki made clear that he had few such qualms.\n\u201cHe said suicide is not allowed in Islam,\u201d Mr. Rahman said in an interview, \u201cbut self-sacrifice is different.\u201d\nThere are two conventional narratives of Mr. Awlaki\u2019s path to jihad. The first is his own: He was a nonviolent moderate until the United States attacked Muslims openly in Afghanistan and Iraq, covertly in Pakistan and Yemen, and even at home, by making targets of Muslims for raids and arrests. He merely followed the religious obligation to defend his faith, he said. \n\u201cWhat am I accused of?\u201d he asks in a recent video bearing the imprint of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. \u201cOf calling for the truth? Of calling for jihad for the sake of Allah? Of calling to defend the causes of the Islamic nation?\u201d\nA contrasting version of Mr. Awlaki\u2019s story, explored though never confirmed by the national Sept. 11 commission, maintains that he was a secret agent of Al Qaeda starting well before the attacks, when three of the hijackers turned up at his mosques. By this account, all that has changed since then is that Mr. Awlaki has stopped hiding his true views.\n The tale that emerges from visits to his mosques, and interviews with two dozen people who knew him, is more complex and elusive. A product both of Yemen\u2019s deeply conservative religious culture and freewheeling American ways, he hesitated to shake hands with women but patronized prostitutes. He was first enthralled with jihad as a teenager \u2014 but the cause he embraced, the defeat of Soviet troops in Afghanistan, was then America\u2019s cause too. After a summer visit to the land of the victorious mujahedeen, he brought back an Afghan hat and wore it proudly around the Colorado State campus in Fort Collins where he studied engineering.\nLater, Mr. Awlaki seems to have tried out multiple personas: the representative of a tolerant Islam in a multicultural United States (starring in a WashingtonPost.com video explaining Ramadan); the fiery American activist talking about Muslims\u2019 constitutional rights (and citing both Malcolm X and H. Rap Brown); the conspiracy theorist who publicly doubted the Muslim role in the Sept. 11 attacks. (The F.B.I., he wrote a few days afterward, simply blamed passengers with Muslim names.) \nAll along he remained a conservative, fundamentalist preacher who invariably started with a scriptural story from the seventh century and drew its personal or political lessons for today, a tradition called salafism, for the Salafs, or ancestors, the leaders of the earliest generations of Islam.\nFinally, after the Yemeni authorities, under American pressure, imprisoned him in 2006 and 2007, Mr. Awlaki seems to have hardened into a fully committed ideologist of jihad, condemning non-Muslims and cheerleading for slaughter. His message has become indistinguishable from that of Osama bin Laden \u2014 except for his excellent English and his cultural familiarity with the United States and Britain. Those traits make him especially dangerous, counterterrorism officials fear, and he flaunts them.\n\u201cJihad,\u201d Mr. Awlaki said in a March statement, \u201cis becoming as American as apple pie and as British as afternoon tea.\u201d\n\u2018Skinny Teenager With Brains\u2019\nTwenty years ago, long before the Sept. 11 attacks and the wars that followed, a shy freshman named Anwar turned up at the little mosque in a converted church a short walk from the Colorado State campus. His American accent was misleading: born in New Mexico in 1971, when his father was studying agriculture there, he had lived in the United States until the age of 7.\nBut he had spent his adolescence in Yemen, where memorizing the Koran was a matter of course for an educated young man, and women were largely excluded from public life.\n His father, Nasser, was a prominent figure who would serve as agriculture minister and chancellor of two universities and who was close to President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the country\u2019s authoritarian leader. Anwar was sent to Azal Modern School, among the country\u2019s most prestigious private schools.\n\u201cI recall Anwar as a skinny teenager with brains,\u201d said Walid al-Saqaf, a neighbor in the 1980s in Sana, the Yemeni capital. For boys of their generation, Afghanistan and its fight to oust the godless Soviet Army was the greatest cause. \n\u201cThere was constant talk of the heroes who were leaving Yemen to join the fight and become martyrs and go to paradise,\u201d recalled Mr. Saqaf, now a doctoral student in Sweden. In the Awlakis\u2019 neighborhood, families would gather to watch the latest videotapes of the mujahedeen, he said.\nBut Nasser al-Awlaki had other ideas for his son, who studied civil engineering in Colorado in preparation for the kind of technocratic career his father had pursued. There was one odd note, given the family\u2019s relative wealth: just after arriving, Anwar applied for a Social Security  number and claimed falsely he had been born in Yemen, evidently to qualify for scholarship money reserved for foreign citizens.\nYusuf Siddiqui, a fellow student who was active with Mr. Awlaki in the mosque and the Muslim Student Association, said there were regular reminders of his Yemeni upbringing. \n\u201cIf you made some pop culture reference, he might not recognize it,\u201d Mr. Siddiqui said. Once, Anwar astonished his Americanized friends by climbing a nearby mountain barefoot. \u201cHe just said, \u2018That\u2019s how we do it in Yemen,\u2019\u201d Mr. Siddiqui recalled. \nAccustomed to Yemeni mores, he was not comfortable interacting with women. Once, when a female American student stopped by the Muslim Student Association to ask for help with math homework, \u201cHe said to me in a low tone of voice, \u2018Why don\u2019t you do it?\u2019\u201d Mr. Siddiqui said.\nStill, Mr. Awlaki was neither among the most conservative Muslim students nor among the libertines who tossed aside religious restrictions on drinking and sex. He ran successfully for president of the Muslim Student Association against a Saudi student who was far stricter.\n\u201cI remember Anwar saying, \u2018He would want your mom to cover her face. I\u2019m not like that,\u2019\u201d Mr. Siddiqui said.\nHis vacation trip to Afghanistan, around the time the Soviet-backed Communist government fell from power, appears to have brought a new interest in the nexus of politics and religion. He wore an Eritrean T-shirt and the Afghan hat and quoted Abdullah Azzam, a prominent Palestinian scholar who provided theological justification for the Afghan jihad and was later known as a mentor to Osama bin Laden.\nMeanwhile, at the Islamic Center of Fort Collins, the little mosque where volunteers took turns giving the Friday sermon, Mr. Awlaki discovered a knack for preaching. If he could boast of no deep scholarship, he knew the Koran and the sayings of the prophet, spoke fluent English and had a light touch. \n\u201cHe was very knowledgeable,\u201d said Mumtaz Hussain, 71, a Pakistani immigrant active in the mosque for two decades. \u201cHe was an excellent person \u2014 very nice, dedicated to religion.\u201d\nHe expressed no anti-American sentiments, said Mr. Hussain, whose son served in the National Guard. \u201cThis is our motherland now. People would not tolerate sermons of that kind,\u201d he said.\nYears later, on his blog, Mr. Awlaki would compare Thomas Gradgrind, Charles Dickens\u2019s notoriously utilitarian headmaster in \u201cHard Times,\u201d \u201cto some Muslim parents who are programmed to think that only medicine or engineering are worthy professions for their children.\u201d\nIt sounds like a hint at his own experience, and some family acquaintances say there was tension between Anwar and his father over career choices. But in 1994, Mr. Awlaki married a cousin from Yemen \u2014 whom by custom he did not introduce to his male friends \u2014 left behind engineering, and took a part-time job as imam at the Denver Islamic Society.\n\u2018He Had a Beautiful Tongue\u2019\nLike many an evangelical Christian pastor, Mr. Awlaki preached against vice and sin, lauded family values and parsed the scripture, winning fans and rising to successively larger mosques. \nIn Denver, however, there was an episode that might have been an omen. A Saudi student at the University of Denver told an elder that he had decided, with Mr. Awlaki\u2019s encouragement, to travel to Chechnya to join the jihad against the Russians. The elder, a Palestinian American in his 60s, thought it ill advised and confronted Mr. Awlaki in a loud argument.\n\u201cHe had a beautiful tongue,\u201d recalled the elder, who asked not to be named. \u201cBut I told him: \u2018Don\u2019t talk to my people about jihad.\u2019 He left two weeks later.\u201d\nAt 25, he landed for five years at Arribat al-Islami, a stucco building with blue-green tile under a towering palm tree at the edge of San Diego. \u201cHe lit up when he was with the youth,\u201d said Jamal Ali, 40, an airport driver. He played soccer with younger children and took teenagers paintballing. \u201cI saw him evolving in trying to understand where he fit into Islam,\u201d Mr. Ali said.\nLincoln W. Higgie III, 71, an art dealer who lived across quiet Saranac Street from the mosque and the small adjoining house where Mr. Awlaki lived with his wife and two toddlers, recalls an engaging neighbor who apologized about parking problems that came with the flood of Friday worshipers. \nOn Thursdays, Mr. Higgie remembered, Mr. Awlaki liked to go fishing for albacore, and he would often bring over a sample of the catch, deliciously prepared by his wife. The Awlakis\u2019 son and daughter would play on Mr. Higgie\u2019s floor, chasing his pet macaw, while the men compared notes on their travels.\n\u201cI remember he was very partial to the Blue Mosque in Istanbul,\u201d Mr. Higgie said. He detected no hostility to non-Muslims, no simmering resentment against America.\nIn his private life, he was not always puritanical. Even as he preached about the sanctity of marriage amid the temptations of American life (\u201cespecially in Western societies, every haram is available,\u201d he said, using the Arabic word for the forbidden), he was picked up twice by the San Diego police for soliciting prostitutes; he was given probation.\nHe displayed a very American entrepreneurial streak, exploring a possible business importing Yemeni honey and attending seminars in Las Vegas focused on investing in gold and minerals (and once losing $20,000 lent by relatives). Eventually a regular at the mosque proposed a venture that would prove hugely successful: recording Mr. Awlaki\u2019s lectures on CD.\nStarting in 2000, Mr. Awlaki would record a series of highly popular boxed sets \u2014 three, totaling 53 CDs, devoted to the \u201cLife of Muhammad\u201d alone; others covering the lesser prophets of Islam (including Moses and Jesus), the companions of the prophet and an account of the hereafter.\nThe recordings appear free of obvious radicalism. (IslamicBookstore.com has added a notice to its Web listings of Mr. Awlaki\u2019s work, saying the recording \u201chas been reviewed and does not contain any extremist statements.\u201d) \nShakir Muhammad, a Fort Collins engineer who is active in the mosque there, said he became a fan of the CD sets, finding them enthralling even on repeated listening. Only once did a passage give him pause; Mr. Awlaki discussed suicidal violence and did not quite condemn it.\n\u201cI thought, \u2018This guy may be for it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Muhammad said. \u201cIt bothered me.\u201d\nA Mysterious Goodbye\nOne day in August 2001, Mr. Awlaki knocked at the door of Mr. Higgie, his neighbor, to say goodbye. He had moved the previous year to Virginia, becoming imam at the far bigger Dar al-Hijrah mosque, and he had returned to pick up a few things he had left behind.\n As Mr. Higgie tells it, he told the imam to stop by if he was ever in the area \u2014 and got a strange response. \u201cHe said, \u2018I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be seeing me. I won\u2019t be coming back to San Diego again. Later on you\u2019ll find out why,\u2019\u201d Mr. Higgie said. \nThe next month, when Al Qaeda attacked New York and Washington, Mr. Higgie remembered the exchange and was shaken, convinced that his friendly neighbor had some advance warning of the Sept. 11 attacks.\nIn fact, the F.B.I. had first taken an interest in Mr. Awlaki in 1999, concerned about brushes with militants that to this day remain difficult to interpret. In 1998 and 1999, he was a vice president of a small Islamic charity that an F.B.I. agent later testified was \u201ca front organization to funnel money to terrorists.\u201d He had been visited by Ziyad Khaleel, a Qaeda operative who purchased a battery for Osama bin Laden\u2019s satellite phone, as well as by an associate of Omar Abdel Rahman, the so-called Blind Sheik, who was serving a life sentence for plotting to blow up New York landmarks.\nStill more disturbing was Mr. Awlaki\u2019s links to two future Sept. 11 hijackers, Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaq Alhazmi. They prayed at his San Diego mosque and were seen in long conferences with the cleric. Mr. Alhazmi would follow the imam to his new mosque in Virginia, and 9/11 investigators would call Mr. Awlaki Mr. Alhazmi\u2019s \u201cspiritual adviser.\u201d\nThe F.B.I., whose agents interviewed Mr. Awlaki four times in the days after the Sept. 11 attacks, concluded that his contacts with the hijackers and other radicals were random, the inevitable consequence of living in the small world of Islam in America. But records of the 9/11 commission at the National Archives make clear that not all investigators agreed.\nOne detective, whose name has been redacted, told the commission he believed Mr. Awlaki \u201cwas at the center of the 9/11 story.\u201d An F.B.I. agent, also unidentified, said that \u201cif anyone had knowledge of the plot, it would have been\u201d the cleric, since \u201csomeone had to be in the U.S. and keep the hijackers spiritually focused.\u201d\nThe 9/11 commission staff members themselves had sharp arguments about him. \u201cDo I think he played a role in helping the hijackers here, knowing they were up to something?\u201d said one staff member, who would speak only on condition of anonymity. \u201cYes. Do I think he was sent here for that purpose? I have no evidence for it.\u201d\nThe separate Congressional Joint Inquiry into the attacks suspected that Mr. Awlaki might have been part of a support network for the hijackers, said Eleanor Hill, its director. \u201cThere\u2019s no smoking gun. But we thought somebody ought to investigate him,\u201d Ms. Hill said. \nAlarmed about Mr. Awlaki\u2019s possible Sept. 11 connections, a State Department investigator, Raymond Fournier, found a circuitous way to charge Mr. Awlaki with passport fraud, based on his false claim after entering the United States in 1990 that he had been born in Yemen.\nA warrant was issued, but prosecutors in Colorado rescinded it, concluding that no criminal case could be made. Mr. Awlaki returned from a trip abroad in October 2002 \u2014 an act some colleagues say was evidence for his innocence of any 9/11 role \u2014 for what would prove to be his last stay in the United States. \nDuring that trip, he visited Ali al-Timimi, a Virginia cleric later convicted for encouraging Muslims to join the fight against American troops in Afghanistan. Mr. Awlaki \u201cattempted to get al-Timimi to discuss issues related to the recruitment of young Muslims,\u201d according to a motion filed in his criminal case. Mr. Timimi wondered if Mr. Awlaki might be trying to entrap him at the F.B.I.\u2019s instigation, his friends say.\nBut if Mr. Awlaki was cooperating with the government, it would have astonished his associates. As the American authorities rounded up Muslim men after 9/11, he had grown furious.\nAfter raids in March 2002 on Muslim institutions and community leaders in Virginia, Mr. Awlaki led a chorus of outrage, noting that some of the targets were widely viewed as moderates. \n\u201cSo this is not now a war on terrorism, we need to all be clear about this, this is a war on Muslims!\u201d Mr. Awlaki declared, his voice shaking with anger. \u201cNot only is it happening worldwide, but it\u2019s happening right here in America that is claiming to be fighting this war for the sake of freedom.\u201d\nAround that time, Johari Abdul-Malik, a former Howard University chaplain who was joining the staff at Mr. Awlaki\u2019s Virginia mosque, met him at a cafe. Mr. Awlaki said he planned to leave the United States.\n\u201cI tried to convince him that the atmosphere was not as bad as he thought, that it was a positive time for outreach,\u201d Mr. Abdul-Malik recalled. But Mr. Awlaki was shaken by what he saw as an anti-Muslim backlash. And always fond of the limelight, Mr. Abdul-Malik said, Mr. Awlaki was looking for a bigger platform.\n\u201cHe said he might have a TV show for the gulf,\u201d Mr. Abdul-Malik said. \u201cHe might run for Parliament in Yemen. Or he might teach.\u201d \n\u2018Never Trust a Kuffar\u2019\nIn a bare lecture room in London, where Mr. Awlaki moved after leaving the United States, he addressed his rapt, young followers, urging them never to believe a non-Muslim, or kuffar in Arabic.\n\u201cThe important lesson to learn here is never, ever trust a kuffar,\u201d he said, chopping the air, his lecture caught on video. \u201cDo not trust them!\u201d\nThe unbelievers are \u201cplotting to kill this religion,\u201d he declared. \u201cThey\u2019re plotting night and day.\u201d\nIf he had the same knowing tone and touches of humor as in earlier sermons, his message was more conspiratorial. You can\u2019t believe CNN, the United Nations, or Amnesty International, he told his students, because they, too, were part of the war on Islam.\n\u201cWe need to wisen up and not be duped,\u201d Mr. Awlaki said. \u201cMalcolm X said, \u2018We\u2019ve been bamboozled.\u2019\u201d\nMany of his young British Muslim listeners, accustomed to preachers with heavy accents and an otherworldly focus, were entranced by his mix of the ancient and the contemporary, his seamless transition from the 29 battles of the Prophet Muhammad to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. \u201cHe was the main man who translated the jihad into English,\u201d said Abu Yahiya, 27, a Bangladeshi-British student of Mr. Awlaki\u2019s lectures in 2003. \nAt a personal level, said Mr. Rahman, one of the students who studied with Mr. Awlaki in 2003, Mr. Awlaki made it clear that they could no longer pretend to be Muslims while going clubbing at night.\n\u201cI could not be Mohammed in the morning and \u2018Mo\u2019 in the evening,\u201d he said. \nMr. Awlaki\u2019s demand that they make a choice, devoting themselves to a harsh, fundamentalist strain of Islam, offered clarity, he said. \n\u201cIt would hit the audience automatically in their hearts and minds,\u201d Mr. Rahman said. When others claimed the popular cleric was brainwashing them, Mr. Rahman said, \u201cWhen you got a lot of dirt in your brain, you need a washing. I believe he did brainwash me.\u201d\nMr. Awlaki\u2019s fame grew, his CDs kept selling, and he traveled around Britain lecturing. But he had a hard time supporting himself, according to people who knew him, and in 2004 he had moved to Yemen to preach and study.\nIn mid-2006, after he intervened in a tribal dispute, Mr. Awlaki was imprisoned for 18 months by the Yemeni authorities. By his later account on his blog, he was in solitary confinement nearly the entire time and used it to study the Koran, to read literature (he enjoyed Dickens but disliked Shakespeare) and eventually, when it was permitted, to study Islamic scholarship.\nNotably, he was enraptured by the works of Sayyid Qutb, an Egyptian whose time in the United States helped make him the father of the modern anti-Western jihadist movement in Islam.\n\u201cBecause of the flowing style of Sayyid I would read between 100 and 150 pages a day,\u201d Mr. Awlaki wrote. \u201cI would be so immersed with the author I would feel Sayyid was with me in my cell speaking to me directly.\u201d\nTwo F.B.I. agents questioned him in the Yemeni prison, and Mr. Awlaki blamed the United States for his prolonged incarceration. He was right; John D. Negroponte, then the director of national intelligence, told Yemeni officials that the United States did not object to his detention, according to American and Yemeni sources.\nBut by the end of 2007, American officials, some of whom were disturbed at the imprisonment without charges of a United States citizen, signaled that they no longer insisted on Mr. Awlaki\u2019s incarceration, and he was released.\n\u201cHe was different after that \u2014 harder,\u201d said a Yemeni man who knows Mr. Awlaki well.\nMr. Awlaki started his own Web site, reaching a larger audience than ever. But finding that he was constantly followed by Yemeni security in Sana, the capital, he moved to the house of an uncle in Shabwa, the rugged southern province and his tribe\u2019s traditional turf.\nLast October, friends said, he heard the distant whine of a drone aircraft circling overhead. Worried that he was endangering his relatives, he fled to the mountains. While his role is unclear in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terrorist network\u2019s Yemeni affiliate, American officials believe he has become \u201coperational,\u201d plotting, not just inspiring, terrorism against the West.\nFrom his hide-out, Mr. Awlaki sends out the occasional video message. But his reported influence on the Times Square bombing suspect, Mr. Shahzad, suggests that no matter what happens to him, his electronic legacy is secure. His message will endure in hundreds of audio and video clips that his followers have posted to the Web, a mix of religious stories and incitement, awaiting the curious and the troubled.\nMr. Awlaki\u2019s transformation has left a trail of bewilderment, apprehension and fury among many people who knew and worshiped with him in the United States. Mr. Siddiqui, his college friend, said he was \u201csurprised and disappointed.\u201d \n\u201cHe\u2019s turning his back not only on the country where he was born but on his Muslim brothers and sisters in this country,\u201d he said.\n Mr. Abdul-Malik said that his former fellow imam at the Virginia mosque \u201cis a terrorist, in my book\u201d and that Mr. Awlaki and his like-thinkers were trying to reduce Islam to a \u201cmedieval narrative. It\u2019s the Hatfields and the McCoys: you hit me, I hit you.\u201d\n Some Muslim families have asked whether they should keep Mr. Awlaki\u2019s scriptural CDs, Mr. Abdul-Malik said. He tells them it is their decision, but he has advised shops not to carry even the earlier, benign Awlaki material.\n\u201cIt becomes,\u201d he said, \u201ca gateway for the unsuspecting.\u201d",

    "text": "Muslims and Islam Were Part of Twin Towers\u2019 Life\n2010-09-10T18:30:30.000Z\nSometime in 1999, a construction electrician received a new work assignment from his union. The man, Sinclair Hejazi Abdus-Salaam, was told to report to 2 World Trade Center, the southern of the twin towers. \nIn the union locker room on the 51st floor, Mr. Abdus-Salaam went through a construction worker\u2019s version of due diligence. In the case of an emergency in the building, he asked his foreman and crew, where was he supposed to reassemble? The answer was the corner of Broadway and Vesey.\nOver the next few days, noticing some fellow Muslims on the job, Mr. Abdus-Salaam voiced an equally essential question: \u201cSo where do you pray at?\u201d And so he learned about the Muslim prayer room on the 17th floor of the south tower.\nHe went there regularly in the months to come, first doing the ablution known as wudu in a washroom fitted for cleansing hands, face and feet, and then facing toward Mecca to intone the salat prayer. \nOn any given day, Mr. Abdus-Salaam\u2019s companions in the prayer room might include financial analysts, carpenters, receptionists, secretaries and ironworkers. There were American natives, immigrants who had earned citizenship, visitors conducting international business \u0097 the whole Muslim spectrum of nationality and race.\nLeaping down the stairs on Sept. 11, 2001, when he had been installing ceiling speakers for a reinsurance company on the 49th floor, Mr. Abdus-Salaam had a brief, panicked thought. He didn\u2019t see any of the Muslims he recognized from the prayer room. Where were they? Had they managed to evacuate?\nHe staggered out to the gathering place at Broadway and Vesey. From that corner, he watched the south tower collapse, to be followed soon by the north one. Somewhere in the smoking, burning mountain of rubble lay whatever remained of the prayer room, and also of some of the Muslims who had used it.\nGiven the vitriolic opposition now to the proposal to build a Muslim community center two blocks from ground zero, one might say something else has been destroyed: the realization that Muslim people and the Muslim religion were part of the life of the World Trade Center. \nOpponents of the Park51 project say the presence of a Muslim center dishonors the victims of the Islamic extremists who flew two jets into the towers. Yet not only were Muslims peacefully worshiping in the twin towers long before the attacks, but even after the 1993 bombing of one tower by a Muslim radical, Ramzi Yousef, their religious observance generated no opposition\n \u201cWe weren\u2019t aliens,\u201d Mr. Abdus-Salaam, 60, said in a telephone interview from Florida, where he moved in retirement. \u201cWe had a foothold there. You\u2019d walk into the elevator in the morning and say, \u2018Salaam aleikum,\u2019 to one construction worker and five more guys in suits would answer, \u2018Aleikum salaam.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nOne of those men in suits could have been Zafar Sareshwala, a financial executive for the Parsoli Corporation, who went to the prayer room while on business trips from his London office. He was introduced to it, he recently recalled, by a Manhattan investment banker who happened to be Jewish.\n\u201cIt was so freeing and so calm,\u201d Mr. Sareshwala, 47, said in a phone conversation from Mumbai, where he is now based. \u201cIt had the feel of a real mosque. And the best part is that you are in the epicenter of capitalism \u0097 New York City, the World Trade Center \u0097 and you had this island of spiritualism. I don\u2019t think you could have that combination anywhere in the world.\u201d\nHow, when and by whom the prayer room was begun remains unclear. Interviews this week with historians and building executives of the trade center came up empty. Many of the Port Authority\u2019s leasing records were destroyed in the towers\u2019 collapse. The imams of several Manhattan mosques whose members sometimes went to the prayer room knew nothing of its origins.\nYet the room\u2019s existence is etched in the memories of participants like Mr. Abdus-Salaam and Mr. Sareshwala. Prof. John L. Esposito of Georgetown University, an expert in Islamic studies, briefly mentions the prayer room in his recent book \u201cThe Future of Islam.\u201d\nMoreover, the prayer room was not the only example of Muslim religious practice in or near the trade center. About three dozen Muslim staff members of Windows on the World, the restaurant atop the north tower, used a stairwell between the 106th and 107th floors for their daily prayers.\nWithout enough time to walk to the closest mosque \u0097 Masjid Manhattan on Warren Street, about four blocks away \u0097 the waiters, chefs, banquet managers and others would lay a tablecloth atop the concrete landing in the stairwell and flatten cardboard boxes from food deliveries to serve as prayer mats.\nDuring Ramadan, the Muslim employees brought their favorite foods from home, and at the end of the daylight fast shared their iftar meal in the restaurant\u2019s employee cafeteria. \n\u201cIftar was my best memory,\u201d said Sekou Siby, 45, a chef originally from the Ivory Coast. \u201cIt was really special.\u201d\nSuch memories have been overtaken, though, by others. Mr. Siby\u2019s cousin and roommate, a chef named Abdoul-Karim Traor\u00e9, died at Windows on the World on Sept. 11, as did at least one other Muslim staff member, a banquet server named Shabir Ahmed from Bangladesh.\nFekkak Mamdouh, an immigrant from Morocco who was head waiter, attended a worship service just weeks after the attacks that honored the estimated 60 Muslims who died. Far from being viewed as objectionable, the service was conducted with formal support from city, state and federal authorities, who arranged for buses to transport imams and mourners to Warren Street.\n There, within sight of the ruins, they chanted salat al-Ghaib, the funeral prayer when there is not an intact corpse.\n\u201cIt is a shame, shame, shame,\u201d Mr. Mamdouh, 49, said of the Park51 dispute. \u201cSometimes I wake up and think, this is not what I came to America for. I came here to build this country together. People are using this issue for their own agenda. It\u2019s designed to keep the hate going.\u201d",

    "text": "Dozens Die in Iraq Hotel Fire\n2010-07-16T10:13:17.000Z\nSULAIMANIYA, Iraq \u0097 A hotel lacking smoke detectors, fire extinguishers and other basic safety equipment was engulfed in flames on Thursday night here in Iraq\u2019s northern region of Kurdistan, killing 28 people, many of them foreigners working in the booming oil and telecommunications industries.\nAn electrical short circuit appeared to have started the fire on a lower floor and quickly turned the five-story Soma Hotel in the center of Sulaimaniya into a death trap, inflicting a heavy toll on a corner of Iraq that has been largely insulated from the scale of violence and death that engulfed the rest of the country over the past seven years.\nThe dead included two babies and a pregnant woman, according to hospital officials. Twenty-two people were injured. \nA metal gate at the back of the hotel, apparently intended as a fire exit, was locked at the time of the fire, according to one of the hotel\u2019s owners and several guests. \nThe flames were fanned by wood and fabric from a large furniture showroom on the hotel\u2019s two lower floors, an official in the provincial government said. Nothing remained of the showroom except a carpet of ash and twisted frames and bed springs. \nAt least three people jumped out of windows on the higher floors, with two people sustaining broken legs, but surviving. Mariwan Jabbar, 29, was one of them. \u201cI saw people on fire,\u201d Mr. Jabbar said from his hospital bed, where both of his legs were in casts. \u201cThat\u2019s the only reason that made me jump. I did not want to die in those circumstances.\u201d\nThe Kurdistan regional government said half of those who died in the fire were Iraqis, while the others were international guests from Australia, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Canada, Ecuador, Lebanon and Britain, among other countries. \nDale Prince, a spokesman for the United States Embassy\u2019s Regional Reconstruction Team in Erbil, the region\u2019s capital, said that it appeared so far that no Americans had died in the fire. He also said there were reports that two Americans had sustained minor injuries.\nMany of the international guests who died had worked for Terraseis, a company based in Dubai that was conducting seismic and geophysical surveys at several oil fields throughout the Kurdistan region that are operated by foreign oil companies. Four foreign engineers who worked for Asiacell, a telecommunications company in Sulaimaniya, also died in the fire, according to the company\u2019s director, Farouq Mulla-Mustafa.\nFor many people, the fire illustrated how little attention the region\u2019s officials have paid to safety standards during a construction frenzy that has accompanied the oil boom over the past few years.\n\u201cThe disaster is that safety conditions have not been taken into consideration in most public spaces like hotels, halls and apartments,\u201d Massoud Barzani, the region\u2019s president, said in a statement on Friday.\nMr. Barzani said he had ordered the regional government to examine safety measures at all public buildings.\nSabah Shalaq, 52, a Lebanese engineer who works for a company that is installing telecommunications towers in Iraq, said he had been staying at the Soma Hotel for two years. He said that only the western employees of Terraseis had fire extinguishers outside their doors \u0097 and that they had bought the extinguishers themselves shortly after moving in several months ago.\nMr. Shalaq said he had become aware of the fire when smoke began seeping through the windows into his room, which overlooked the street. He said he could not leave through the hallway, which was filled with thick black smoke. He said he had put a wet towel over his head and stood at the window until he escaped on a ladder hoisted by the fire brigade.\nMany of those staying in the back of the hotel were less fortunate. Those rooms were filled with incinerated furniture and walls covered in soot. Desert boots, eyeglasses, cooking utensils and personal belongings lay scattered around.\nOutside the burned-out hotel, members of the Kurdish security force piled up laptop computers, luggage and handbags into the back of a pickup truck.\nA dazed looking couple visiting from the Iranian Kurdish city of Mahabad stood nearby. They said they had been staying at the hotel and had avoided the fire only because a friend insisted they come out for a late supper.\n\u201cI am still terrified,\u201d said Rogene Younes, 25. ",

    "text": "Choosing Not to Forget What Is Painful to Recall\n2010-03-26T00:17:00.000Z\nOn a street off Washington Square, a bell tolled 146 times on Thursday, once for each woman and man who died in the great fire there so very long ago. Dozens of schoolchildren read the names of the victims, one by one, then laid carnations upon a makeshift memorial. A fire truck raised its ladder in tribute but only so far \u2014 a reminder of a rescue effort that fell tragically short.\nEverything was as it was supposed to be, 99 years to the day since a fire at the Triangle shirtwaist factory took the lives of 146 garment workers \u2014 most of them women, most of them Jewish and Italian immigrants, most of them heartbreakingly young.\nThe flames that engulfed the factory, on the top three floors of a building at Washington Place and Greene Street, was the most cataclysmic disaster to befall a New York workplace until Islamist fanatics turned airplanes into missiles in 2001. But even the attacks of Sept. 11 have not diminished Triangle\u2019s central place in the consciousness of an oft-wounded city.\nLike all rituals, Thursday\u2019s remembrance of March 25, 1911, moved to a practiced rhythm. An anniversary ceremony has been held at that corner for years. Repetition, however, in no way stole from poignancy.\nThere were accounts of how the low-paid seamstresses who made ladies\u2019 blouses \u2014 shirtwaists \u2014 were trapped in the blaze. How locked doors prevented many from fleeing to safety. How the firefighters\u2019 tallest ladder reached only to the sixth floor, well below workers trying to stave off death two, three and four floors higher. How in desperation \u2014 does this sound familiar? \u2014 many jumped to their deaths.\nThere were speeches from labor leaders about how the disaster led to tougher safety regulations but also about how much remains undone. Locking in workers? Wal-Mart was found to have been doing that just a few years ago. Last month, in an echo of Triangle, 21 workers in Bangladesh died in a fire at a garment factory with locked exits. \nAnd there was the mournful tolling of a firehouse bell, each ring accompanying a name, each name capturing a soul: Lizzie Adler, Rosina Cirrito, Yetta Goldstein, Gaetana Midolo, Simie Wisotsky and, every now and then, Unidentified Woman and Unidentified Man.\nNew York generally prefers the future tense. It is not always good at remembering.\nSept. 11 aside, anniversaries of disasters come and go with barely a nod. Until 9/11, none was deadlier than the 1904 burning of the General Slocum, a poorly equipped excursion steamboat that caught fire in Hell Gate\u2019s waters. More than 1,000 people died, most of them women and children. Yet the anniversary, June 15, usually passes unnoticed.\nNot so with the Triangle fire. If anything, the observances have been expanding and are likely to grow still more in 2011, the centennial year. Events on Thursday included programs at Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village and Christ the King Regional High School in Middle Village, Queens.\nThe Queens event was led by Vincent Maltese, whose older brother, Serphin, is a former state senator. For them, the Triangle fire is personal. Their grandmother and her two daughters died. The girls were 18 and 14. \u201cMy grandfather never really talked about it, except once a year,\u201d said Vincent Maltese, 76. \u201cHe\u2019d get moody toward the end of March.\u201d\nPerhaps the fire endures in civic memory because it has clear constituencies. It is part of the Italian-American narrative and, arguably even more so, of Jewish-American history. But there is more to it, said David Von Drehle, the author of \u201cTriangle: The Fire That Changed America.\u201d \nTriangle \u201cspeaks to large trends \u2014 the immigrant story, the progressive political story, the labor movement story and the women\u2019s rights story,\u201d Mr. Von Drehle said. \u201cIt\u2019s illustrative of all those currents, which continue to be living issues in a way that steamboat safety is not.\u201d\nFor similar reasons, Ruth Sergel, a filmmaker, organizes her own memorial. On the anniversary, she leads volunteers in a project called Chalk. They visit the places where each of the 146 victims lived, mostly in the East Village and on the Lower East Side. At those locations, on the pavement, they chalk in the names and ages of those who died.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the idea of making communal memory visible,\u201d Ms. Sergel said, describing it as \u201ca different kind of power.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not permanent,\u201d she said. \u201cIt washes away. But you know what? It\u2019s going to come back next year.\u201d",

    "text": "Malaysia Seeks to Export Its Halal Credentials to China\n2010-12-21T16:32:00.000Z\nKUALA LUMPUR \u2014 Electrical goods, coffee, herbs and spices are among the products that MasterMalaysia Global usually trades with its Chinese partners.\nNext year, however, the company, which is based in Kuala Lumpur, is planning to help export another home-grown commodity to China \u2014 Malaysia\u2019s knowledge of producing halal goods, food permissible under Islam.\nWith the global halal industry worth an estimated $2.1 trillion, much of it centered on food products like meat, Malaysia is keen to become a bigger player \u2014 with the help of China.\nMalaysia is recognized for its stringent standards covering the production of halal goods, but when it comes to meat, Malaysia is not a major producer.\nChina, meanwhile, has no shortage of land for livestock, but its halal accreditation procedures lack a well-established reputation, considered crucial in convincing Muslims that their food has been produced according to Islamic principles. Alcohol and pork, for instance, are forbidden.\nMalaysian companies like MasterMalaysia Global are increasingly seeking to exploit this gap by helping Chinese companies learn how they can produce food that meets Malaysian halal standards.\nMuslims may constitute only a fraction of China\u2019s population, but they amount to 22 million, according to a 2009 report by the Pew Forum. Industry observers say many opportunities exist for those specializing in halal products.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good for us to have a business partner in China,\u201d said Rosmawati Sayuti, managing director of MasterMalaysia. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big market. We hope that we can have a win-win situation.\u201d\nMasterMalaysia is currently in talks with Chinese companies in Henan Province about how they can help suppliers produce beef, chicken and mutton that meets Malaysian halal standards. The ultimate aim is to help the Chinese producers obtain halal accreditation from the Malaysian authorities. MasterMalaysia would then help distribute the meat in China, and hopes to eventually help the companies export to Malaysia.\nOfficials from the Department of Islamic Development Malaysia, the government body responsible for enforcing the country\u2019s halal standards, have already visited China to certify meat intended for export to Malaysia.\nHakimah Mohammad Yusof, a principal assistant director, said the department usually only certified products that were marked for export to Malaysia, although officials might be willing to consider looking at products for overseas markets.\nWhile Malaysia\u2019s history of monitoring halal products dates from the 1960s, China\u2019s halal certification system is at an earlier stage of its development, according to Darhim Hashim, chief executive of the International Halal Integrity Alliance, a nongovernment organization based in Kuala Lumpur that recently released international guidelines to cover some aspects of the industry.\n\u201cMalaysia is one of the pioneers in terms of halal certification,\u201d he said.\nMr. Darhim said halal certification was regulated by a central government authority in Malaysia, while in China it was carried out by provincial bodies, often nongovernment organizations, some of which were endorsed by local governments.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just not sure what standards are being applied and whether it\u2019s being applied consistently,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s missing is the consistency across the provinces.\u201d\nMasterMalaysia Global plans to help Chinese companies learn about Malaysian halal guidelines, which cover all aspects of the supply chain from the farm to the consumer. \u201cBefore they thought that halal is only about the slaughter,\u201d Ms. Rosmawati said of the Chinese producers. \u201cWe start from what the cow, what the chicken, eats. The food for these animals must be halal.\u201d\nMasterMalaysia Global will initially only work with meat suppliers, but hopes to eventually source raw materials from China to use in the production of halal cosmetics and pharmaceuticals in Malaysia.\nWhile Malaysia is seeking to increase local halal production, Jamil Bidin, chief executive of the Halal Industry Development Corporation, a government agency, said China offered a plentiful supply of raw materials and land, an established agricultural industry, good infrastructure and relatively cheap labor costs, combined with growing domestic demand for halal goods. \u201cIt makes economic sense for some Malaysian companies to go over to China to take advantage of all these things,\u201d he said. \nMr. Jamil, who will travel to Ningxia Province next month to help introduce Malaysian companies to Chinese business partners, said interest in the halal industry had grown among Chinese provincial governments in recent years.\nFe Jazzareen, a principal consultant at KasehDia Research and Consulting, a firm based in Kuala Lumpur that provides research and training services for companies wanting to enter the halal industry, said compliance with halal guidelines was only the first step. Any company wanting to succeed in the market would also need to establish a good reputation to win the trust of Muslim consumers, she said.\n\u201cTransfer of knowledge is one of the services already in demand by countries outside of Malaysia, in forms of training programs and consulting services,\u201d Ms. Jazzareen said.\nKasehDia has already fielded inquiries from companies based in countries like Korea, Bangladesh and the United States who want to enter the halal market, and hopes to expand its services to Chinese companies.\nWhile the industry and the Malaysian authorities believe China represents a major opportunity for both Malaysian exports and joint ventures, there are concerns that even halal products may not be immune to Chinese imitations.\nMs. Rosmawati is concerned that unscrupulous companies may try to copy the Malaysian halal logo on products that have not been certified.\nShe plans to encourage some of the bigger producers to bring unfinished products to Malaysia for packaging and bar coding, which she says would help improve quality control.\nMalaysia, meanwhile, is also trying to increase its local halal production and exports. It has opened a number of \u201chalal parks\u201d in recent years, where investors are encouraged to set up manufacturing operations. Halal producers, both local and foreign, are offered financial incentives like tax breaks, Mr. Jamil said.\nAlthough there are no official trade figures available specifically for halal products, a number of Malaysian companies already export accredited halal goods to China, from spices, frozen seafood and palm oil-based products to pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.\nThe Malay Chamber of Commerce has signed agreements with Chinese government authorities to help Malaysian businesses introduce their halal goods, said Mohamad Alayuddin Hasan, vice president of the chamber.\nMr. Mohamad said awareness of halal products was growing in China, and Malaysian companies were hoping to appeal to both Muslims and non-Muslims.",

    "text": "A Singular Place With Plural Ethnicities\n2010-08-27T20:05:57.000Z\nONE might as well begin by considering a single street corner in the east-central Queens neighborhood of Jamaica Hills: 164th Street, near 85th Avenue. \nThree storefronts stand shoulder to shoulder: a modest grocery, whose sign declares Indian-Pakistani-American roots, selling Indian DVDs, two for $5, and asking 75 cents for a microwave-warmed vegetable samosa; Annam Brahma, a new Indian vegetarian restaurant with the motto \u201cFood Is God,\u201d one of several businesses with exteriors painted a light blue to signal devotion to Sri Chinmoy, the late Bangladeshi spiritual teacher who made his home in the area; and St. Gerasimos Greek Orthodox Church. \nThat stretch goes some way toward capturing a neighborhood whose residents cite harmonious diversity as a defining element. \u201cIt\u2019s getting more and more diverse as time goes by,\u201d said Peter Voutsinas, a 30-year-old residential contractor born and raised in the neighborhood, which has about 11,000 people. \u201cIt\u2019s not putting up any barriers.\u201d\nDeborah Ayala, a lifelong resident and the president of the Jamaica Hills Community Association, described it as \u201ca great melting pot in a very small area.\u201d \nA visitor is likely to see many people wearing brilliantly colored saris, perhaps bought at Divine Robe Supreme, a little shop on Parsons Boulevard. Customers browsed there on a recent afternoon amid the smell of incense and the rattle of a sewing machine in the back corner. \nAdarini Inkei, a former longtime resident, was visiting from her home in Geneva. She was chatting with Deepmala Thomas, a young woman wearing an ivory sari.\n\u201cYou can come here and have a free cup of chai,\u201d Ms. Inkei said. \u201cWhere else can you get that?\u201d\nThe area\u2019s Muslim community was the chief draw for Imam Shamsi Ali, the director of the Jamaica Muslim Center. \nAs a new arrival in 2005, he rented, later paying $690,000 for a three-bedroom house on 85th Avenue, where he lives with his wife and five children.\n\u201cI think for me, as a Muslim New Yorker, what\u2019s most attractive is that it\u2019s easy for me to access my basic needs,\u201d he said, emphasizing the importance of a Muslim community in which to raise his children, not to mention shop for halal food.\nIn recent weeks, as the city and the nation have debated the merits of building an Islamic center and mosque known as Park51 two blocks from ground zero in Lower Manhattan, Imam Ali has been interviewed by news outlets.\n He supports Park51\u2019s construction at that site, arguing that it would be \u201ca blow to the extremists.\u201d\nThe imam, who is 43 and originally from Indonesia, counts Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and African-Americans among his Muslim congregation of over 2,000. His center, founded in 1976, for years operated out of a basement but is now housed at a large minaretted building on 168th Street.\nMarie Adam-Ovide, district manager of Community Board 8, said a 2006 city rezoning stopped a pattern of frequent demolition of single-family homes to make way for multifamilies. Ms. Ayala described the rezoning, and its preservation of the neighborhood\u2019s character, as a victory.\nMs. Adam-Ovide said she sometimes heard complaints about college students who rent in the neighborhood \u0097 St. John\u2019s University is to the north \u0097 but added, \u201cOf course the students are on their own, and they\u2019re young, and they don\u2019t keep up the property.\u201d \nMr. Voutsinas, for one, said he was glad to have the students in the mix. His family owns two houses: one, on 151st Street, that they share with renters, and another, on 84th Drive, that they rent out to students. \nWHAT YOU\u2019LL FIND\nAlso sometimes called Jamaica Hill \u0097 singular \u0097 this area of less than a square mile is bounded to the north by the Grand Central Parkway, to the east by Home Lawn Street, to the south by Hillside Avenue, and to the west by Parsons Boulevard. \nAs the name suggests, the terrain gently rolls upward from Hillside Avenue. The Georgian Revival-style Jamaica High School, declared a landmark in 2009, looms high over an adjacent oasis, Captain Tilly Park.\nAs one ascends the hill northward, the crowdedness and traffic fade and the area becomes quiet and residential, its streets lined with parked cars. It is a neighborhood of mostly single-family homes, along with a number of large multifamilies housing both renters and extended families.\n Hillside Avenue, the neighborhood\u2019s southern border, is a wide commercial thoroughfare lined with small restaurants, shops and the occasional hotel. \nOn that avenue, near 164th Street, is Singh\u2019s West Indian and American Grocery, a vast shop whose title does little justice to its offerings. They extend to Indian musical instruments, tropical fish, traditional Indian clothing and an abundance of cricket equipment.\n Jag Singh and his wife, Kumarie, have owned the shop for 15 years, though when asked how business had been lately, Mr. Singh, who wore cargo shorts, a white T-shirt and a thin gold necklace, answered, \u201cNo good, no good, no good.\u201d\n Two months ago, after several failed attempts to get a loan that might jump-start business, Ms. Singh hung a \u201cFor Rent\u201d sign in the front window. Given the current economy, she said, not many people are in the market for a $400 harmonium.\nAs she sat behind the cash register browsing the daily papers, Mr. Singh paced the floor; their young son bounced a tennis ball off the wall and then chased after it among the piles of goods.\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL PAY\nSingle-family homes average about $460,000 to $500,000, depending on condition and number of bedrooms, brokers say. Two-family homes tend to get $575,000 to $600,000.\nA two-bedroom rental in Jamaica Hills typically goes for about $1,450 a month, depending on amenities and location. \nOne homeowner who regularly rents to college students said the going rate for one bedroom in a house was $600 to $700.\nMs. Ayala, the community association president, lives with her husband, brother and three young children in the house where she grew up, a four-bedroom two-bath duplex on 168th Place. \nHer parents bought the house in 1979 for $65,000, she said, estimating that it would sell in the $400,000 range today.\nMary Pasquarelli, a broker for Century 21 American Homes, said many of her clients were immigrants just recently arrived in America. \n\u201cA lot of people, culturally, like to stick together,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a lot of houses of worship nearby. And it\u2019s quite affordable as far as Queens is concerned.\u201d\nMs. Pasquarelli said Jamaica Hills houses averaged two to three months on the market, which she said was largely the same as last year. Prices, too, have remained static.\nTHE SCHOOLS\nElementary schools in the general area include Public School 131 Abigail Adams, on 172nd Street, for prekindergarten through Grade 5. Last year 45.9 percent of fourth graders met standards in English and 71.8 in math, versus 45.6 and 58.4 citywide.\nIn addition to other secondary schools, there is the Queens Gateway to Health Sciences School, on Goethals Avenue, starting at Grade 7 and continuing through Grade 12. A city quality review last year found that \u201cthe school is a safe and nurturing environment that students see as a \u2018large family\u2019 in which everyone looks out for the well-being of their neighbors.\u201d \nLast year 94.4 percent of eighth graders met standards in English and 85.6 in math, versus 37.5 and 46.3 citywide.\nAt Jamaica High School, on Gothic Drive, SAT averages for 2009 were 403 in reading, 412 in math and 407 in writing, versus 406, 416 and 401 citywide.\nWHAT TO DO\nSeveral businesses along Parsons Boulevard are inspired by the teachings of Sri Chinmoy. Among them is the vegetarian Panorama Cafe, near 85th Avenue. Serving specialty coffees, sandwiches and brunch, it also hosts music and poetry events. \nSt. John\u2019s University, just outside the area, has several Division I sports teams whose games and matches are open to the public. Traditions pub on 164th Street is a destination for college students and residents alike. \n The nearest branch of the Queens Library is just beyond neighborhood borders, on Merrick Boulevard between 89th and 90th Avenues.\nTHE COMMUTE\nJamaica Hills is served by the F train, which stops at Parsons Boulevard and 169th Street along Hillside Avenue. The ride to Midtown takes about half an hour. Buses serving the neighborhood include Nos. 43 and 68, along Hillside Avenue. Buses also run north-south along both Parsons Boulevard and 164th Street, carrying passengers into downtown Jamaica.\nTHE HISTORY\nThe Tillys, once a prominent family in the area, owned the land that has become Captain Tilly Park, a nine-acre patch of hilly greenery that includes a body of water known as Goose Pond. \nThe park\u2019s namesake is George H. Tilly, who was killed in 1899 in the Philippines, during a mission to repair a damaged telegraph cable.",

    "text": "Even in Distant Lands, the Welcomes Are Warm\n2010-03-30T02:25:50.000Z\nUNTIL the age of 18, I never traveled outside of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. But in the last four decades, I\u2019ve clocked more than two million miles and have been in more than 120 countries. Last year, I was in South Africa, Zambia, Cambodia, Vietnam, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh, all countries in which Room to Read has programs.\n Travel is an integral part of my life. I love going to new countries, meeting new people and trying different airlines. \n I\u2019ve learned to take travel in stride. I have to. If I didn\u2019t, I would be a nervous wreck.\n I remember flying in a tiny plane in the Caucasus, going from Armenia to Georgia.\n The cockpit door was open, and I could see the pilot and co-pilot. There was a bottle of whiskey sitting on the floor between them. Aside from the few passengers on the plane, the cargo consisted of several large drums of jet fuel positioned at the end of the seating area. We were warned not to smoke. No kidding.\n After some reflection, I didn\u2019t think it was that odd they had a bottle of whiskey in the cockpit. It was probably used to help calm their nerves. If you had to fly some of these planes, you would probably need a medicinal aid, too.\n The adaptability of people from different cultures always amazes me.\n I remember being in Beirut during the \u201ctroubles,\u201d when the militias ruled West Beirut. I was sitting in an outdoor cafe on Hamra Street with a lot of other people. We heard gunfire in the distance. Soon a militia convoy was passing down the street firing their guns. \n Just before they reached our cafe, everyone calmly picked up their coffee and simply moved inside. After they passed, the group moved back outside, sat down and resumed conversation as if nothing happened. I didn\u2019t freak out because no one around me seemed overly concerned. I learned to adapt by taking my cues from the locals.\n When I travel, I really do learn a lot from the local population. And I\u2019m always grateful for that.\n I went to Mongolia on a temporary assignment, and wound up loving the place so much I stayed for three years. \n People always assume that living in Mongolia is difficult. In fact, the exact opposite is true. The people there make it easy for you. I think a lot of that has to do with their Buddhist faith. Everyone is welcoming, friendly and in touch with their environment.\n You can drive for eight hours, and not see anyone. Eventually you may encounter a lone family of herders, as I often did.\n These people will invite you into their homes, a \u201cger,\u201d or yurt as we often call them. The family will feed you and share their \u201cairag\u201d with you. \n Airag is fermented mare\u2019s milk, similar to vodka, except that vodka doesn\u2019t have much of a taste, and airag definitely tastes like animal. It has a very strong aftertaste and a real kick to it. It\u2019s an acquired taste, but it will warm you in temperatures that can drop to minus 40 in the winter. \n I always admired the simplicity of rural Mongolian life. But it\u2019s changing. I remember stopping at a family\u2019s ger. Next to it was a satellite dish, which was nearly as large as the ger itself. Everyone was watching a championship sumo wrestling match. \n One of my fondest memories is being in the Gobi Desert watching wrestling on television. The match was fascinating. The company was great. And the airag? Well, that was pretty good, too.",

    "text": "Life Expectancy in China Rising Slowly, Despite Economic Surge\n2010-11-24T00:27:45.000Z\n A quick quiz: Which of the following countries has had the smallest increase in life expectancy since 1990 \u0097 Bangladesh, China, Pakistan, South Korea or Sudan?\n The answer is not war-torn Sudan or tumultuous Pakistan. It isn\u2019t South Korea, which started from a higher level than any of the others. And it isn\u2019t abjectly poor Bangladesh.\n It\u2019s China, the great economic success story of the last two decades and the country that inspires fear and envy around the world. Yet when measured on one of most important yardsticks of all, China does not look so impressive.\n From 1990 to 2008, life expectancy in China rose 5.1 years, to 73.1, according to a World Bank compilation of United Nations data. Nearly every other big developing country, be it Brazil, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia or Iran, had a bigger increase over that span, despite much slower economic growth. Since 2000, most of Western Europe, Australia and Israel, all of which started with higher life expectancy, have also outpaced China. \n The moral? Economic growth makes almost any societal problem easier to solve, but growth doesn\u2019t guarantee better lives \u0097 or better health \u0097 for everyone. That\u2019s been true for centuries. The rate of growth and the kind of growth both matter.\n If you scan the globe today, you may end up wondering whether any country has landed on the right mix. Europe offers a good life to many people, with generous vacations, parental leaves and health benefits, but its economies have been growing slowly, which is one reason its debts are so onerous. \n The United States grew more quickly than Europe in recent decades, but many of the gains flowed to a small slice of the population. Median household income, adjusted for inflation, actually fell from 2000 to 2007 \u0097 and has fallen more since the financial crisis began in 2007. \n China can sometimes look like the economy of the future, having grown stunningly fast for almost 30 years now, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. But it, too, has real problems. Above all, its growth has been uneven. The coast has benefited much more than the interior. Almost everywhere, some aspects of life have improved much more than others. \n Whether China can switch to a more balanced form of growth, as its leaders have vowed, will obviously have a big effect on the rest of the global economy. Yet it\u2019s worth remembering that the biggest impact will be on the one-sixth of the world\u2019s population who live in China. And arguably the best example is the fact that the country has grown vastly wealthier but only modestly healthier. \n There is an intriguing parallel here to the Industrial Revolution. The eminent economist Richard Easterlin has noted that longevity and health did not improve much when economic growth took off in the early 19th century. \n With rising incomes, people could afford better food, clothing and shelter. But they were also exposed to more disease because so many of them were moving to cities. The combined effect appears to have been \u201cstagnation or, at best, mild improvement in life expectancy,\u201d Mr. Easterlin has written. \n The Mortality Revolution, as he calls it, did not occur for almost another a century. It depended on relatively cheap investments in public health, like sanitation, and on the spread of scientific methods.\n Similarly, in today\u2019s China, many more people have acquired indoor plumbing, heating, air-conditioning or other basics. Other aspects of the boom, however, have pushed in the opposite direction. \n As in the Industrial Revolution, many people have left the countryside and poured into crowded cities. Accidents have become common, like the Shanghai fire last week or a series of workplace tragedies in recent months. Obesity is rising. Pollution is terrible. \nI recently spent some time in China, and despite everything I\u2019d heard in advance about the pollution, I was still taken aback. The tops of skyscrapers in Beijing can be hard to see from the street. Breathing the smog can feel like having a permanent low-grade sinus infection. For the Chinese, cancer has displaced strokes as the leading cause of death, partly because of pollution, notes Yang Lu of the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. \n Finally, there is the medical system itself. The dismantling of state-run industrial companies over the last two decades has ended the cradle-to-grave benefits system known as the iron rice bowl. In its place was a market-based medical system many Chinese could not afford. Even in emergencies, people sometimes had to bring cash to the hospital to get treatment.\n Early last year, the Chinese government began expanding health insurance coverage, with the goal of making it universal by 2020. The initial signs look pretty good. The World Bank does not have data past 2008, but numbers published by the C.I.A. suggest that life expectancy has risen in the last two years. In my travels, I visited a simple, clean clinic in rural northern China that seemed to be providing the kind of basic care that could make a huge difference.\n Of course, whatever the problems with China\u2019s boom, it still has significantly improved the lives of its citizens. Many fewer of them live in grinding poverty, and the population is living longer, even if the gains have not been as large as in many other countries.\n Over any extended period, economic growth is probably necessary for higher living standards. It\u2019s just not enough. As Tsung-Mei Cheng, a health policy expert at Princeton, argues, \u201cEconomists and the media tend to pay too much attention to the growth of G.D.P. over all, and not enough to its distribution.\u201d\n There is, after all, another large country with unimpressive recent gains in life expectancy, even smaller than China\u2019s. That\u2019s right: the United States. Since 1990, we have been passed by Chile, Denmark, Slovenia and South Korea, among others. China is still five years behind us, but it\u2019s gaining.",

    "text": "City Slickers Take to the Crops, With Song\n2010-05-27T21:19:49.000Z\nIT was prime growing weather on Shelter Island, N.Y., as a breeze blew in from Dering Harbor, and Bennett Konesni was tending to his field of dreams: three neatly planted acres of bok choy, cauliflower, kale, Asian mustard greens, spinach, garlic, lettuce, onions, potatoes and leeks, with room for the peppers, eggplants and 15 varieties of tomatoes soon to be transplanted. Coming to a plot of leafy snap peas, inspiration struck. Suddenly he erupted in a full-throttle rendition of \u201cOats, Peas, Beans and Barley Grow\u201d: \u201cDo you, or I, or anyone know/How oats, peas, beans and barley grow?\u201d\nFor the record, Mr. Konesni, part of a thriving crop of young American farmers, does.\nWas anyone listening to his impromptu serenade? Who cared? \nThis is how work gets done on Sylvester Manor.\nFor the past couple of summers, the manor has resounded with music as Mr. Konesni, a scholar of work songs, has pushed his family\u2019s ancestral estate into the next era with the help of some strong-voiced volunteers.\nNow a nonprofit educational enterprise, the manor is among the New York-area farms attracting locavores, green-minded students and urbanites suffering from nature-deficit disorder who yearn to raise produce and livestock for a day, a week or longer.\n\u201cThere\u2019s this incredible boom right now,\u201d Mr. Konesni said, \u201ca broad and deep interest in creating vibrant local food communities and the landscapes that go with them.\u201d\nScott Chaskey, the farmer-poet who oversees Quail Hill Farm in Amagansett, N.Y., where Mr. Konesni apprenticed in 2001, said he had worried that his volunteer and community-sponsored agriculture programs might flag with the economy \u0097 only to see the demand grow.\nAnd the six-year-old volunteer force at the Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture in Pocantico Hills, N.Y., is steadily increasing, drawing participants from Manhattan, Brooklyn, Westchester County, Connecticut and New Jersey, said Jill S. Isenbarger, the center\u2019s executive director.\n\u201cPeople are really interested in getting their hands dirty and experiencing nature, if you will, through farming,\u201d Ms. Isenbarger said. \u201cFor some folks, it\u2019s a way to apply what they learn through us and take that back to their own communities or gardens.\u201d \nOthers, like the New York City couple whose five-year plan involved trading in real-estate development for a chicken farm, want to sample the lifestyle before making a midcareer change.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Ms. Isenbarger added with a laugh, \u201ccome the first 95-degree day out in the fields, a lot of people rethink it.\u201d\nTime was when Shelter Island \u0097 8,000 acres nestled between the North and South Forks of Long Island \u0097 belonged to the Sylvester family, who settled here in 1651 as part of an English and Dutch consortium that supplied produce, livestock and oak barrels to the sugar trade in Barbados. \nWorked by indentured and enslaved Africans and American Indians until 1827, the manor shipped cheeses, hams and candles to New London, Conn., and Rhode Island ports as early as the 1740s. In the 19th century it was home to Eben Norton Horsford, considered the father of modern food chemistry and the inventor of the first calcium phosphate baking powder.\nThe property, whittled down over the years to 243 acres, has been overseen since 2007 by Mr. Konesni, 27, a great-great-great-great grandson of Horsford and the 15th generation of the Sylvester family to call the manor home. \nOn this balmy afternoon Sylvester Manor was abuzz \u0097 with workers and insects \u0097 though no one seemed to be rethinking anything. \nOut in the Windmill Field, named for the 1810 wind-powered gristmill that once ground grain into flour, Gunnar Wisseman, the longtime caretaker, was tilling sod in preparation for planting clover, the better to squeeze out quack grass and poison ivy. \nDown the road at the 1735 Georgian mansion, Edith Gawler, an architecture student and fiddler who is Mr. Konesni\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, was staffing the office, which oversees volunteer and education programs. (A banjo-making course is scheduled for June 7 through 12, and a work song workshop for June 17.)\nInside the barn, Zo\u00eb Wonfor, an intern from Calgary, Alberta, and John Costa, an M.B.A. student from Antioch University New England in Keene, N.H., had returned from the greenhouse and were now counting seeds.\n And at the movable chicken house, Brooklyn schoolchildren examined eggs, while Araucana, Silver Speckled Hamburg and Naked Neck breeds pecked at their feet.\nVolunteers may apply for short-term slots \u0097 normally, a day or two \u0097 by e-mail, to manorvolunteers@gmail.com. Those who would like to stay longer must submit an application and have a series of interviews.\nMr. Costa, a native of Bangladesh, had been lured to Sylvester Manor by a shared interest with Mr. Konesni in bringing the arts into sustainability, he said. A student of capoeira, the Afro-Brazilian practice that combines martial arts with music and dance, he balked at capoeira\u2019s singing requirements. But although the bashful Mr. Costa had been there for only a day, Mr. Konesni had already introduced him to the farm\u2019s unwritten tenet: you work, you sing. \nIn 2005 Mr. Konesni was awarded a Watson Fellowship to travel the globe for a year and learn work songs from Ghana, the Netherlands, Mongolia, Tanzania and Switzerland. He has since woven his musical gleanings into the tapestry of the manor, whose earliest laborers might have sung some of those same tunes while toiling in its fields.\nSonging, as Mr. Konesni calls it, \u201cis not about being a professional singer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Swiss call it juuz, which means erupting into joyful noise.\u201d\n \u201cIt may not turn work into play, exactly, but it makes it more tolerable and ultimately more profitable,\u201d Mr. Konesni explained, noting that the rhythm and momentum created by singing in unison help workers cope with physical exertion and tedium.\n\u201cSometimes we end up singing what\u2019s on Long Island\u2019s Top 20,\u201d Ms. Wonfor admitted. \u201cLady Gaga is really popular out in the field.\u201d\n\u201cPaparazzi\u201d in the potato patch?\nThough Mr. Konesni\u2019s repertory ranges from slave anthems to a form of Swiss yodeling used to communicate with livestock, the point, he said, is to get through the work \u0097 the beating sun, the back-breaking kneeling and bending, the bugs \u0097 while having fun.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to make a successful farm, a farm that is effective and self-sustaining, and encourage a culture of food that is joyful and fair,\u201d Mr. Konesni said. \u201cWe\u2019re shaping the world around us in a way we love.\u201d\nIF YOU GO\nFarms that welcome volunteers:\nSYLVESTER MANOR, 80 North Ferry Road, Shelter Island, N.Y.; (631) 749-0626, manorvolunteers@gmail.com, sylvestermanor.wordpress.com. \nSTONE BARNS CENTER FOR FOOD AND AGRICULTURE, 630 Bedford Road, Pocantico Hills, N.Y.; (914) 366-6200, stonebarnscenter.org. \nQUAIL HILL FARM, Deep Lane, Amagansett, N.Y.; (631) 283-3195, peconiclandtrust.org/quail_hill_farm.\nHONEY BROOK ORGANIC FARM, 260 Wargo Road, Pennington, N.J.; (609) 737-8899, honeybrookorganicfarm.com.\nSHELBURNE FARMS, 1611 Harbor Road, Shelburne, Vt.; (802) 985-8686, Ext. 327, shelburnefarms.org.",

    "text": "The Travel Advantages of a Brief Stint on \u2018The Sopranos\u2019\n2010-06-28T23:05:10.000Z\nALMOST all my travel is for the Nobelity Project, either shooting a film, promoting and showing a film or working with our partners on projects. I traveled to 20 countries on five continents for our feature documentary \u201cNobelity\u201d and its sequel, \u201cOne Peace at a Time.\u201d\nThough the trips were sometimes grueling, it was incredible to meet with Nobel laureates like Muhammad Yunus, Steve Chu, Helene Gayle and Desmond Tutu to get their take on how we can provide basic human rights like food, water and education to every child on this planet.\nCurrently, I\u2019m traveling quite a bit to Haiti, where we\u2019re starting a school reconstruction effort in partnership with Architecture for Humanity, and Kenya, where we\u2019re building Mahiga Hope High School, a model school for rural Africa.\nIt seems like I\u2019m constantly in the air or at an airport. Because we\u2019re a nonprofit, I\u2019ve learned to make do with economy seating even though I\u2019m 6 feet 7 inches tall and have to wrap my legs around my body to try to get comfortable. Fortunately, I try to stick with one airline to rack up points, and a lot of times I can snag an upgrade.\nWhen I\u2019m on a film trip, I bring tons of gear. I\u2019ve seen people take a look at my carry-on and then make a beeline to another checkpoint.\nI don\u2019t take it personally. My bag is big, filled with two high-definition video cameras, a small digital still camera, batteries, chargers, tape and audio equipment. I can never check it all. If my bag got lost, I couldn\u2019t replace this stuff quickly since I\u2019m almost always in remote locations.\nMost of my flights are long haul, and I\u2019ve set some personal records.\nI used to fly a lot from Dhaka, Bangladesh, back home to Austin, Tex. With all the layovers, it was 44 hours. I thought that was the longest flight ever. But then I beat that time when we screened \u201cOne Peace at a Time\u201d at the Maui Film Festival.\nI asked Willie Nelson, who is in the documentary, to sing before the screening. He told me he would sing if I showed up. So I flew from Nairobi to London, then on to Chicago and then Austin, to drop off my camera equipment. Then, I boarded a flight to Los Angeles and then another one to Maui. Total time: 54 hours.\nI don\u2019t mind talking to seatmates on flights. I always carry a couple of DVDs with me and hand them out. Sometimes people are really interested in the work, and that\u2019s always rewarding.\nOther times people are interested in hearing about what it was like to work on \u201cThe Sopranos.\u201d I\u2019m always surprised when people recognize me. I had only a small role in the series, playing Janice Soprano\u2019s crazy boyfriend Aaron Arkaway, a born-again, narcoleptic hippie. People love the show, and no matter what part of the world I\u2019m in \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d always has a fan base.\nI was in Nairobi recently, and I was wandering around downtown looking for a music store so I could buy some instruments for our school. I wasn\u2019t having any luck. Then a young Kenyan man came up to me and said, \u201cHave you heard the good news?\u201d \u0097 one of Aaron\u2019s most memorable lines. Turns out, he was a huge Sopranos fan and he was more than happy to help me out.\nIt was a fun encounter. And the good news for our school? I was able to get them a keyboard and a guitar.",

    "text": "A Peculiarly Punjabi Quarrel\n2010-04-08T14:00:59.000Z\nThe ruby red seeds of the pomegranate gleamed invitingly as I coaxed my 7-year-old daughter to eat the fruit. Loath to do any task without being regaled with an accompanying narrative, she asked me to retell the story of how as a child I would steal pomegranates from a neighbor\u2019s garden and cause trouble. Despite several retellings, the story continues to exercise a hold on her, in part because it allows her a peek at the child now obfuscated by her mother\u2019s adult facade. \nThe neighbor\u2019s house was across from ours, separated by a narrow brick road into which branches of pomegranate trees spilled from the enclosed garden. In summer, after hours of sweaty play, there was pleasure in crumpling in the verdant shade, gossiping as we ate the plucked fruit. It never occurred to us that the pomegranate didn\u2019t belong to us and that, technically, we were stealing.\nBefore long the matriarch of the neighbor\u2019s house would open the gate, see us sucking the fruit that she had so religiously tended, and let out a howl. Then my mother would be summoned and shown the evidence and the women would proceed to quarrel. My mother would attempt to make amends but the matriarch would dig up old grievances, her voice getting more shrill with each new volley, drawing inquisitive women from other households. My mother, never one to let a jab go unanswered, would argue back, ensuring afternoon entertainment for all.\nAt some point the quarrel would run out of steam, and the matriarch would troop back inside, only to return with a reed stool that she would then lean upside down against her front door. It was a symbol that the quarrel would be renewed the following afternoon. Over the next few days this ritual argument would continue, producing minute details from the past; stories were remembered and embellished, grievances were aired and sorrows shared.\nThis custom of turning the reed stool upside down was a peculiarly Punjabi one, and in the town where I grew up, which straddled the India-Pakistan border, it seemed to hold a particular relevance. \nDuring my childhood in Indian Punjab, Pakistani Punjab was omnipresent. The reception from Pakistan TV out of Lahore was superior, and we consumed a daily diet of Pakistani serials, ghazals and news reports. We naturally chose to disregard the routine anti-India propaganda of PTV. Any visitor to our otherwise-nondescript town was always taken to the border to witness the \u201cBeating the Retreat\u201d ceremony. A colonial legacy, it signaled an end to the day\u2019s hostilities as the khaki-clad men of the Indian border security force and Pakistani rangers in olive-green Pathan suits stiff-marched the length of the checkpost, dramatically eyeballed one another, flung the gates open, and, unsmiling, shook hands. A joint show by the two enemies, it provided a chance to gawk at the Pakistanis on the other side and see that they looked just like us. \nThose were the days of respite, when the reed stool was leaning upside down against the border. There were other days when the two countries drew blood. During the Indo-Pakistan war of 1971, my parents trudged through darkness for miles, their young children straddled on their shoulders and clinging to their waists. My family was attempting to flee the border area, which triumphant Pakistani tanks were threatening to breach. In the 1980s, terrorists seeking to establish an independent Sikh state rocked Indian Punjab. The Indian government blamed Pakistan for sponsoring terrorism. Pakistan blamed India for creating Bangladesh and festering the separatist movement in Sindh.\nIn the 62 years since the partition of the subcontinent, India and Pakistan have fought four wars and regularly accused each other of sponsoring terrorism. In November 2008, Mumbai was attacked by terrorists operating out of Pakistan. Following that, India severed dialogue. After a 15-month hiatus the two neighbors have again initiated talks. \nPeople on both sides of the border are understandably cynical about the on again-off again sparring. Perhaps it is time to put the reed stool back inside and talk. ",

    "text": "Life and Death, Stat\n2010-10-01T22:26:35.000Z\nTHOMAS HAZAZ wanted out. Lying on a gurney, his chest covered with heart sensors, Mr. Hazaz was trying to cajole doctors in the emergency room at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn to unplug him. In less than 24 hours, he needed to be in a tuxedo, walking his youngest daughter down the aisle in a Staten Island banquet hall. Mr. Hazaz, 52, a bartender at Embers, a steakhouse in Bay Ridge, kept saying that the pain in his elbows was nothing but overexertion from lifting heavy stuff at work. The professionals, though, suspected a heart attack.\n\u201cFrom a scale of 1 to 10, it\u2019s a 1,\u201d the patient said of his pain. \u201cI\u2019ve been taking Aleve.\u201d He went on: \u201cI self-diagnose myself. I\u2019ve done that my whole life. I know what I did to cause this.\u201d Then a nurse found a plump vein and plunged in a needle to draw blood. \u201cOw,\u201d Mr. Hazaz said. \u201cThat hurts.\u201d He did not specify how much on a scale of 1 to 10.\nIt was a Thursday night around 10. He had come in perhaps 30 minutes before, sent from the restaurant midshift in an ambulance. Dr. Sal Suau, one of 40 full-time emergency room physicians at Maimonides, broke the bad news: \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to be here for a few hours.\u201d\nA few hours later, worse news: The father of the bride learned that his \u201celbow\u201d pain was, in fact, a heart attack. The staff members readied him for an angiogram, in which they would essentially thread a catheter into his body to to help produce X-ray images of arteries that might be blocked. His older brother and sister, who had met him at the hospital, hoped the episode might make him finally quit smoking and lose weight.\n\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d asked Dr. Hillary Cohen, 36, who had been briefed not only about his medical condition but about the wedding.\n\u201cI\u2019m depressed,\u201d Mr. Hazaz said, verging on tears. \u201cI\u2019m not going to my daughter\u2019s wedding. Talk about bad timing.\u201d\nThere never seems to be a particularly good time to go to the emergency room, but nearly every American will pass through one at some point. Most will take home harrowing memories or gratifying ones. They will remember inefficiency or expert care. Almost always, the experience is often clouded in stress or, as time goes by, embellished by a Hollywood lens.\nDespite years of health-policy debates lamenting the expense, and predictions that the rise of managed care would thin the crowds, the nation\u2019s emergency rooms are busier than ever. Maimonides, a Borough Park hospital known for its cardiac and stroke care, has the fifth-busiest one in the nation. It saw 109,925 patients in 2009 \u2014 the year of the flu pandemic \u2014 up from 97,613 in 2008 and 81,931 in 2005. Mr. Hazaz, who repeatedly told anyone who would listen he had last seen a doctor in 1979, was one of 294 people treated there that Thursday, one of 1,511 during a typical end-of-summer week.\nMONDAYS are the busiest days. \u201cPeople put off their \u2018emergencies,\u2019 until then,\u201d said Dr. Joshua Schiller, 42, who taught high school economics, worked as a carpenter and rode a motorcycle across America before medical school. \u201cThe challenge,\u201d he said, \u201cis trying to figure out who is truly sick from the chronic conditions we see.\u201d\nNearly two-thirds of the 7,240 people who visited the Maimonides emergency room in August were covered by Medicaid or Medicare, the government insurance programs for the poor and the old; 18 percent had private health insurance; the rest, like Mr. Hazaz, were uninsured. Last year, $38 million in bills went unpaid, up from $32 million the year before.\nLike the neighborhoods around it, Maimonides is filled with immigrants \u2014 the hospital employs 46 patient representatives who speak a total of 70 languages. While it is not a designated trauma hospital \u2014 no bullet wounds or horrific car-crash victims \u2014 many patients arrive in the throes of crisis. But many others stream in with chronic conditions, like diabetes, asthma or gastrointestinal problems, often because they have no primary-care doctor or do not want to wait to see one.\nA week spent inside the Maimonides emergency room, which packs 87 beds or more into 19,000 square feet and is staffed by 80-plus people at a time, revealed the challenges and the rewards of the frenetic, burdened system, and provided an unusual window into urban life.\nOver five days, six people learned they had cancer, and six women discovered \u2014 surprise! \u2014 they were pregnant. One child swallowed a coin, and one man broke a Q-Tip off in his ear. Eight people came in with appendicitis, 14 had heart attacks, and 18 had strokes. One man was pronounced dead.\nA mother consoled her teenage daughter in Mandarin; a father soothed his preschool son in Bangla; a Hasidic man in a long black coat chatted with his father in Yiddish; and an older woman boomeranged from English to Russian and back again.\n\u201cControlled chaos,\u201d Dr. Cohen called the emergency room, but it is more than that: It is a place of cooperation and compromise, of hard work and heartbreak; a place that churns around the clock and runs as much on humor as on grit.\n\u201cDID he show you his \u2018situation?\u2019\u00a0\u201d asked Kerri DeRienzo, a longtime E.R. nurse, referring to the chiseled abdominal muscles of Dr. Jonathan Rose, a boyish sort who everyone loves to tease. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t think it, but he\u2019s got his own situation going on there.\u201d\nDr. Rose, a showman who appeared in commercials as a child for a decade \u2014 \u201cHe tells everyone,\u201d a nurse said, playfully rolling her eyes \u2014 puts a premium on helping scared patients and concerned relatives to feel at ease.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening today?\u201d he asked Joseph Batiato, 88, on Tuesday afternoon.\n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d said Mr. Batiato, who was lying in the emergency room\u2019s acute wing, 21 beds reserved for the most urgent cases.\n\u201cLet me ask you a funny question,\u201d Dr. Rose said. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d\n\u201cMaimonides,\u201d Mr. Batiato replied, as if prizes were at stake.\nMr. Batiato, a World War II veteran who lives in Bay Ridge but has roots stretching to Mott Street, was having serious problems with his stomach. He blamed food poisoning, although he mostly eats at home. Dr. Rose ordered up an endoscopy and blood tests.\nMarion Batiato, his wife of 61 years, eyed the doctor skeptically. \u201cYou look like a baby,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI\u2019m 35,\u201d he told her. \u201cI could be president. I don\u2019t look like a president?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhy, \u2019cause I\u2019m not black?\u201d Dr. Rose asked, prompting laughter all around.\nSuddenly, Mr. Batiato piped in: \u201cWhat am I doing here?\u201d Dr. Rose responded: \u201cI ask myself the same question every time I get up.\u201d\nThe hospital serves many older patients, who often arrive seriously ill, frightened and lonely.\nOn Monday, Gregory Friedman, 36, a senior staff nurse who grew up in Belarus, spent hours holding the hand of a 97-year-old man who was in pain and close to death, speaking to him reassuringly in Russian. The man, who had no family in the United States, had \u201cdo not resuscitate\u201d and \u201cdo not intubate\u201d orders in place. The hospital\u2019s pain-management team recommended increasing his morphine, but Mr. Friedman, fearing it would drop his blood pressure and kill him, increased the man\u2019s fluids, as well. \u201cIt won\u2019t be me but the angel of death that takes him,\u201d he said.\nTwo days later, Frances Wendroff, 95, who had summoned an ambulance after falling in her Coney Island apartment, cried out for a nurse\u2019s attention from behind a curtain.\nMary Rodriguez, 32, who has worked in the Maimonides emergency room for five years, pulled back the curtain and took Mrs. Wendroff\u2019s hand in hers. Ms. Rodriguez nodded as Mrs. Wendroff asked about her blood pressure and announced, unbidden, that she is on Medicare, then launched into a story about her poor eyesight. After a spell, the nurse gently explained that she must attend to other patients.\n\u201cTo me, coming to the hospital is a haven,\u201d said Mrs. Wendroff. \u201cAll my friends are dead,\u201d she added matter-of-factly. \u201cMy friends are now my talking books. I love to listen to Danielle Steel. I just want a fine love story.\u201d\nJUST as common at Maimonides are children, who arrive regularly with croup, pneumonia, febrile seizures, broken bones, asthma and stomach distress. Many are immigrants or the children of immigrants, so doctors are quick to ask whether they had recently traveled abroad. This often can explain measles, mumps, whooping cough, parasites or gastrointestinal problems. Then there is the odd Lego down a throat or bean up a nose.\nSome come after traditional cures have failed: Vietnamese with circles on their backs, the remnants of heated coins meant to placate a fever; Hispanics with toothpaste on burns. And Chinese babies without diapers because in rural China, potty training often begins in infancy. Nurses explain as best they can that this is not done here.\n\u201cLook, look, Superman,\u201d Margaret Adisano, a pediatric emergency room nurse, said to Mohammad Haque, 3, on Friday afternoon, giving him some stickers of the caped hero.\nMohammad was wailing. Ms. Adisano had just drawn his blood. She wiped away his tears. His Bangladeshi mother, wearing sari-style pants and a shawl called an orman, comforted him. Next, the nurse inserted an intravenous line. The boy screamed again. When it was over, she told him, \u201cGive me five.\u201d Mohammad cracked a faint smile.\nDr. Gill Winnik, a 34-year veteran in the pediatric emergency room, suspected pneumonia. The boy\u2019s father explained that he had not eaten in at least a day and could not sleep. \u201cBut he is not fasting for Ramadan, no?\u201d Dr. Winnik asked. \u201cHe is too young.\u201d The father assured the doctor he was not fasting. \u201cDid you ever take him to Bangladesh to visit family?\u201d Dr. Winnik asked.\nMr. Haque replied, \u201c2008, Dec. 17.\u201d\nToo long ago to be relevant. The boy was sent for X-rays.\nThe nurses who work in pediatrics adore the job. But it can be tricky and emotionally wrenching. They try to follow certain rules: Do as much as possible while the child is in a parent\u2019s arms. Leave the most invasive procedure for last. Above all, never lie. If something is going to hurt, don\u2019t say that it won\u2019t.\nRita Imburgio, a pediatric nurse at Maimonides for 28 years, said she remembered most every death. The toddler who drowned after her twin accidentally stood on her in the tub. The house fire set by a child who killed all his siblings.\nWEDNESDAY, as the clock neared 3 p.m., Dr. Schiller, who is wiry, good-natured and bald, was nearing the end of his shift. Or so he guessed. (He stayed until 5.) \u201cIt\u2019s like being in a casino,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are never conscious of time passing.\u201d\nThere are few windows in the emergency room, and the hum is incessant. In the nonurgent wing, patients typically see a doctor within 20 minutes. But they can lie on gurneys a long time waiting for tests and re-examinations \u2014 the median emergency room stay last year was 3.72 hours. The room is so packed that nurses, doctors and technicians squeeze past quadrupled-up gurneys in each bay, colliding in a dance of you first; no, you first.\nThey like it busy. That is why they chose and got certified in emergency medicine: the adrenaline, the variety, the camaraderie. But they also relish the lulls, which is why the word \u201cquiet\u201d triggers a round of shushes every time it is spoken. Someone says the word and inevitably the red phone \u2014 used to give a head\u2019s up on serious cases \u2014 rings or three ambulances pull up at once.\n\u201cThe E.R. staff is notoriously superstitious,\u201d said Ms. DeRienzo, the nurse who had teased Dr. Rose about his abs. \u201cCertain words you can\u2019t say, or we will curse.\u201d\nAs at other teaching hospitals, a cluster of residents moves from gurney to gurney with attending physicians like Dr. Sergey Motov, a Latvian immigrant with an outsize personality.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Dr. Motov asked over a gurney Monday afternoon.\nA resident explained that the patient had been hit by a car going 35 miles per hour as she walked across the street \u2014 five days before. She had been treated at Bellevue Hospital Center the day of the accident and sent home. But she had vomited twice that morning. She was given a CT scan for her head and an X-ray for her chest and elbow.\n\u201cWhat is causing the vomiting?\u201d Dr. Motov asked in his rat-a-tat style.\n\u201cI like gastro,\u201d a resident replied.\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d Dr. Motov taunted. \u201cShe got hit by a car. Next you\u2019ll tell me she has dengue or malaria.\u201d\nA man with a wrenched knee and a giant Coors tucked among his belongings was up next. \u201cYou won\u2019t drink this here, will you?\u201d Dr. Motov asked, holding up the can. Then a trickier case: a 20-year-old woman with a persistent headache who kept listing to the side. Dr. Motov called in the stroke team and sent her for a CT scan, but found a traffic jam outside the CT room.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got an acute abdominal,\u201d another doctor told him. \u201cCan I get mine in first?\u201d\n\u201cI have a 20-year-old with a stroke,\u201d Dr. Motov said.\n\u201cO.K., you win,\u201d the other doctor replied.\nTHE night shift has its own rhythm. Fewer chronic diseases, more alcoholics and psychiatric cases. Near triage, an Asian man, his hands in restraints, somehow kept managing to strip off his clothes. \u201cHe\u2019s obsessed with his penis,\u201d Dr. Schiller explained.\nSuddenly, after 10 p.m. on Thursday, a 54-year-old Chinese man arrived by ambulance; his heart had stopped during an asthma attack. Nine staff members surrounded him, and Dr. Suau issued instructions: take off his clothes, get the pads, put a line in.\n\u201cThere is no pulse,\u201d a resident said.\n\u201cDid he get epis?\u201d asked Dr. Cohen, referring to epinephrine shots that jolt a heart into action. Yes.\nA paramedic doing chest compressions asked for relief. Atropine was injected. Dr. Cohen, who worked at Maimonides in 2003 and returned in 2008, listened with her stethoscope. \u201cHow long has he been in here?\u201d she asked.\nSix minutes. It feels like a very long time. The staff tries more drugs and compressions. \u201cGuys, we\u2019re going to call it,\u201d Dr. Cohen said, resigned, looking at the clock. \u201c10:44 p.m. Too bad. Such a young guy.\u201d\nThe man\u2019s wife and two of his four children were a few feet away. Dr. Cohen broke the news, using an interpreter. For the first time that week, the room was unmistakably quiet. Then a wail, unrestrained and unforgettable, cut through the air. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel like you get better at this,\u201d Dr. Cohen said.\nA few steps away was Mr. Hazaz, only two years younger than the Chinese man, and suddenly sentenced to watch from a hospital bed as his daughter Danielle got married. The next evening, he smiled into a laptop as his son walked Danielle down the aisle, shimmering in her dress.\n\u201cSay hello to Danielle\u2019s dad via Skype,\u201d the judge instructed, prompting a cheer.\nThen, after Danielle planted her first wifely kiss on her mate, she leaned into the camera to blow one to Mr. Hazaz. \u201cHi, Daddy,\u201d she said, her face wet with tears. \u201cLook at my ring. I love you.\u201d\nWith that, Mr. Hazaz announced it was time for a nap.",

    "text": "YouTube Withdraws Cleric\u2019s Videos\n2010-11-04T13:56:09.000Z\nLONDON \u2014 Under pressure from American and British officials, YouTube on Wednesday removed from its site some of the hundreds of videos featuring calls to jihad by Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born, Yemen-based cleric who has played an increasingly public role in inspiring violence directed at the West.\nLast week, a British official pressed for the videos to be removed and a New York congressman, Anthony Weiner, sent YouTube a letter listing hundreds of videos featuring the cleric. The requests took on greater urgency after two powerful bombs hidden in cargo planes were intercepted en route from Yemen to Chicago on Friday, with the prime suspect being the Yemen-based group Mr. Awlaki is affiliated with, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\nIn an e-mail, Victoria Grand, a YouTube spokeswoman, said that the site had removed videos that violated the site\u2019s guidelines prohibiting \u201cdangerous or illegal activities such as bomb-making, hate speech and incitement to commit violent acts,\u201d or came from accounts \u201cregistered by a member of a designated foreign terrorist organization,\u201d or used to promote such a group\u2019s interests.\nMs. Grand said that Google, YouTube\u2019s owner, sought to balance freedom of expression with averting calls to violence. \u201cThese are difficult issues,\u201d she wrote, \u201cand material that is brought to our attention is reviewed carefully. We will continue to remove all content that incites violence according to our policies. Material of a purely religious nature will remain on the site.\u201d\nIn an interview, Mr. Weiner said that YouTube gave him a \u201cbureaucratic\u201d response at first, but seemed to take his request more seriously after the bombs were found. \u201cIt has become increasingly clear that this guy is an international terrorist that is using their service to do illegal things,\u201d he said.\nBritain\u2019s concern over Mr. Awlaki and his group rose sharply on Wednesday with two developments. A young woman who had embraced his cause and watched dozens of hours of his videos was sentenced to life in prison for the attempted murder in May of a prominent legislator, and Theresa May, home secretary in the government of Prime Minister David Cameron, announced that a member of the Yemeni Qaeda group had been arrested earlier in the year in a previously undisclosed bombing plot against the country.\nBritish officials had warned with increasing urgency of the hazards of allowing the al-Awlaki videos to remain posted on YouTube.\nPerhaps the starkest warning came in a speech delivered last month to a private audience at the Brookings Institution in Washington, reported by The Daily Telegraph on its Web site on Wednesday. Pauline Neville-Jones, a former high-ranking diplomat who is security minister in the Cameron government, said of the videos that Britain would \u201ctake them down\u201d if it was purely a British issue, but that the implications were \u201cglobal\u201d and required action by the United States.\n\u201cThese Web sites would categorically not be allowed in the U.K.,\u201d she said. \u201cThey incite cold-blooded murder, and as such are surely contrary to the public good.\u201d\nBritain\u2019s security agencies have wrestled with dozens of terrorist plots in recent years, successfully foiling most but suffering deeply from the attack on the London transit system in July 2005, which left 56 people, including four suicide bombers, dead.\nIn recent months, top security officials here have issued a series of warnings, saying that an increasingly dire threat came from groups inspired by Osama bin Laden based in Yemen, Somalia and North Africa.\nJonathan Evans, chief of Britain\u2019s domestic intelligence agency, MI5, said recently that Mr. Awlaki and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula were \u201cof particular concern\u201d in the light of their role in the attempted bombing on Dec. 25 of an American trans-Atlantic airliner approaching Detroit, and \u201cbecause he preaches and teaches in the English language, which makes his message easier to access and understand for Western audiences.\u201d\nScotland Yard detectives who investigated the attack on the legislator said outside the court that 21-year-old Roshonara Choudhury, a theology student, watched YouTube videos that showed sequences from sermons by Mr. Awlaki in Yemen in which the preacher urged Muslims everywhere to join in a worldwide holy war against the West. In a transcript of her interrogation published by The Guardian, she spoke of watching hundreds of hours of his videos. She said her motive was to \u201cpunish\u201d the legislator, Stephen Timms, for voting in 2003 for Britain\u2019s participation in the invasion of Iraq.\nHer lawyer told the court that Ms. Choudhury, whose parents immigrated to England from Bangladesh, had been a Muslim moderate \u201cof exemplary character\u201d with no links to terrorist groups until she began browsing militant Muslim Web sites.\nWhen she attacked, as Mr. Timms met with constituents at his office in a London suburb, she was wearing a black floor-length gown and a head covering that revealed only her eyes. She pulled out a knife and stabbed him twice in the abdomen.\nMs. Choudhury refused to attend the trial, saying she did not recognize the legitimacy of the British court system. But she appeared by video link from a prison in London for Wednesday\u2019s sentencing, when the judge, Sir Jeremy Cooke, said that she would have to serve a minimum of 15 years before applying for parole. He described Ms. Choudhury as \u201can intelligent young woman who has absorbed immoral ideas and wrong patterns of thinking,\u201d and added: \u201cYou do not suffer from any mental disease. You have simply committed evil acts coolly and deliberately.\u201d\nYouTube has faced other periods of pressure to remove videos linked to radical Islamists. Jeffrey Rosen, a professor of law at George Washington University who has written extensively about YouTube\u2019s policies, including in The New York Times Magazine, said that in 2007, the Labour Government in Britain called on YouTube to block terrorist recruitment videos featuring Islamic fighters with guns and rockets.\nLast May, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman\u2019s staff asked Google to remove about 120 terrorist recruitment videos from YouTube. Google removed some videos that showed gratuitous violence or hate speech, but refused to take down others.\n\u201cYouTube and Google deserve credit for trying to distinguish videos that are merely offensive from those that show graphic violence or hate speech or risk inciting imminent violence, which is the line American courts have drawn in free speech cases since the 1960s,\u201d Professor Rosen said.",

    "text": "A Wave of Indie Angst Hits South Asian Cinema\n2010-10-21T20:52:51.000Z\nBollywood, until recently the home of fine romances with no kisses, now takes smooching in stride. Did anyone expect the younger generation of South Asian filmmakers to stop there? How could they, growing up not only with Bollywood \u0097 itself only a portion of the Indian film business \u0097 but also with Hollywood, Hong Kong cinema, indies and all the global culture the Internet can deliver.\nAs the seventh annual South Asian International Film Festival makes plain, a new wave of independent films is out there, eager to bust taboos, sexual and otherwise. These films, showcased in the dramatic competition, are the festival\u2019s most unusual offerings. \nBut the festival, running Wednesday through Nov. 2, goes deeper. It also has a shorts competition and something called Spectrum, which includes releases from the outskirts of Bollywood and beyond, and not incidentally, contains the charmers of the group. With 16 features and five shorts in all, mostly from India \u0097 but also from Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh \u0097 the festival gives a good sense of the variety, abundance and liveliness of South Asian film. \nYou can practically see the growing pains in the competition films, mostly by first- or second-time directors. Often experimental, the selections are also self-conscious and terribly solemn. These films want to poke at corners of reality and humanity that the commercial cinema has traditionally ignored. \n\u201cGet some real people\u201d for your film, a woman says to the aspiring director in Srivinas Sunderrajan\u2019s \u201cUntitled Kartik Krishnan Project.\u201d And not just real people, she wants \u201carty\u201d types. \u201cKartik,\u201d billed as India\u2019s first mumblecore movie, is full of them, and arty ideas (about narratives within narratives) and visuals (much soft focus, digital effects and blinking robots). \nWith its rapping, heroin-smoking, angry-young-man hero, a film by the Bengali director Q (the title\u2019s printable translation is \u201cLoser\u201d) thumbs its nose at convention and aims to shock. The story, mostly shot in black and white, is stylishly if diffusely told. But Q can\u2019t resist the meta-narrative. He (or a director called Q) appears, confusing the hero about what\u2019s real and what isn\u2019t. Credits roll. \nBut the film isn\u2019t over. It starts again, and delivers its coup de gr\u00e2ce: an extended, graphic sex scene that simply has no counterpart in Indian cinema, whose idea of raciness used to be to wet, clinging saris. Dear Q, you have succeeded \u0097 I was shocked, though your movie left me cold: too much attitude. \n The rest of the competition is tamer. Aamir Bashir\u2019s meditative, somewhat plodding \u201cHarud\u201d (\u201cAutumn\u201d) dramatizes the crisis in Kashmir and, with its social and political concerns, harks back to the Parallel Cinema, the older tradition of Indian independent filmmaking. \u201cChitra Sutram\u201d (\u201cThe Image Threads\u201d), in Malayalam, is an almost comically ponderous art movie that gets tangled up in cyber space. (Sample dialogue: \u201cDo you want to listen to one of my many thoughts?\u201d)\nThe odd man out is Thiagarajan Kumararaja\u2019s \u201cAnima and Persona,\u201d an existential gangster picture that is the only non-indie in the group. A Tamil film featuring the Bollywood star Jackie Shroff as an aging don, \u201cAnima\u201d is the longest but the most engaging entry in the competition. With his sometimes stately, sometimes punchy visuals, Mr. Kumararaja knows how to tell a story, and he adroitly keeps a number of narrative balls in the air. \nThough not in competition, the opening-night feature, Anurag Kashyap\u2019s \u201cThat Girl in Yellow Boots,\u201d fits in with this new wave. About a British girl searching for her father in Mumbai, this film has a frankness about sex and drugs, and a desire to show the city\u2019s sordid underbelly. But like \u201cKartik Krishnan\u201d it\u2019s short on narrative and long on arty mannerisms, at once fussy and overblown.\nWith the exception of \u201cAnima\u201d the dramatic entries are more interested in personal expression than in entertainment \u0097 Bollywood\u2019s very life blood \u0097 even as they pay lip service to influences like Quentin Tarantino and Bruce Lee. Not so the Spectrum films, which include a couple of real delights: \u201cSlackistan,\u201d a pitch-perfect comedy about restless youths in Islamabad, \u201cthe city that always sleeps\u201d; and \u201cWith Love to Obama,\u201d a recession comedy from Bollywood (no songs, no dances) with a \u201cGodfather\u201d-like idea about the commonalities among gangsters, businessmen and politicians. \nAlmost all the films I saw feature young male protagonists with nothing to do but wander aimlessly through urban landscapes, whether driving Daddy\u2019s Mercedes in Islamabad (\u201cSlackistan\u201d) or knocking about Kolkata in a pal\u2019s rickshaw (\u201cLoser\u201d). Mostly these fellows don\u2019t work, but if they do, they\u2019re probably baby gangsters. \nOr else they dream of escape and of becoming artists \u0097 photographers, maybe, or rappers or, best of all, filmmakers. They dream of pointing a camera at the world they inhabit and documenting their lives.\nAnd like the young filmmakers in this festival, they dream of elevating their angst into art.",

    "text": "Save the Children Breaks With Soda Tax Effort\n2010-12-15T00:26:33.000Z\nOver the last year, Save the Children emerged as a leader in the push to tax sweetened soft drinks as a way to combat childhood obesity. The nonprofit group supported soda tax campaigns in Mississippi, New Mexico, Washington State, Philadelphia and the District of Columbia. \nAt the same time, executives at Save the Children were seeking a major grant from Coca-Cola to help finance the health and education programs that the charity conducts here and abroad, including its work on childhood obesity. \nThe talks with Coke are still going on. But the soda tax work has been stopped. In October, Save the Children surprised activists around the country with an e-mail message announcing that it would no longer support efforts to tax soft drinks. \nIn interviews this month, Carolyn Miles, chief operating officer of Save the Children, said there was no connection between the group\u2019s about-face on soda taxes and the discussions with Coke. A $5 million grant from PepsiCo also had no influence on the decision, she said. Both companies fiercely oppose soda taxes. \nMs. Miles said that after Save the Children took a prominent role in several soda tax campaigns, executives reviewed the issue and decided it was too controversial to continue. \n\u201cWe looked at it and said, \u2018Is this something we should be out there doing and does this fit with the way that Save the Children works?\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the answer was no.\u201d\nMs. Miles said the talks with Coke were continuing and the grant under discussion was significantly larger than past donations from the soft drink giant. Coke has given the group about $400,000 since 1991, according to a company spokeswoman. \nSave the Children has received much more money from Pepsi through the PepsiCo Foundation, which it has designated as a \u201ccorporate partner\u201d in recognition of the $5 million grant for work in India and Bangladesh. PepsiCo awarded the grant in early 2009, before the charity began its soda tax advocacy. \nRepresentatives of both Coca-Cola and Pepsi said they had not asked the charity to alter its position on soda taxes. \nBut soda tax advocates say that soft drink makers are flexing their muscles in opposition to soda taxes. In Washington State, the American Beverage Association, a trade group that includes Coke and Pepsi, spent $16.5 million to win passage of a November ballot initiative that overturned a small tax on soft drinks enacted by the legislature to help plug a budget gap. The beverage association outspent supporters of the tax by more than 40 to 1, and the tax was repealed. \n Jon Gould, deputy director of the Children\u2019s Alliance, an advocacy group in Seattle, said Save the Children\u2019s decision to abandon the issue was \u201ca significant loss, especially at a time when the American Beverage Association has just shown that their resources are unlimited.\u201d The alliance got $25,000 from Save the Children to help advocate for a soda tax.\nKelly D. Brownell, a soda tax advocate and director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University, said that many food and beverage companies made donations to nonprofit groups fighting hunger but it was less common for them to finance work to address obesity. \n \u201cIt would be a shame if there were a quid pro quo and the groups felt pressure to oppose something like a soda tax,\u201d Mr. Brownell said.\nPublic debate about soda taxes has intensified over the last year. Proponents say that if the tax were large enough, perhaps a penny an ounce or more, it could reduce consumption of sugary beverages, which are high in calories and can contribute to obesity. In addition, money raised by the tax could be spent on public health efforts to fight obesity. \nThe soda companies argue that it is unfair to blame their products for the obesity epidemic, which has complex causes. They say that policies should be focused instead on getting people to exercise more. \nSo far, tax proposals have gotten little traction. Last year, federal lawmakers considered a soft drink tax to help pay for health care reform, but that idea was dropped. Governors, state lawmakers and mayors have proposed taxes but made little headway. \nSave the Children\u2019s involvement in the issue began in late 2009, when it got a $3.5 million grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to fight childhood obesity through a program it called the Campaign for Healthy Kids. Save the Children initially financed the work of local groups, some of which focused on improving school lunches and requiring health education in schools. But local activists in Mississippi, New Mexico and Washington State used the grants to push for a soda tax.\nWhen politicians in Philadelphia and Washington proposed soda taxes this year, the Campaign for Healthy Kids got more directly involved, paying for lobbyists and polling. \u201cWe really took the lead on those and were publicly identified with those,\u201d said Andrew Hysell, an associate vice president for Save the Children and the director of the obesity campaign. \nNone of the soda tax measures supported by Save the Children passed, although in Washington, the city council removed a sales tax exemption for carbonated beverages.\nSave the Children\u2019s prominent role in Philadelphia and Washington led top executives of the charity to review the work. Ms. Miles said they concluded the advocacy was not part of the charity\u2019s mission. \n\u201cWe made a decision that it was an issue that was controversial among our constituents and really was not core to the work we\u2019re doing in the U.S.,\u201d Ms. Miles said. She said that while the charity\u2019s constituents included corporate donors, concerns over fund-raising were not involved in the decision. \nMr. Hysell informed soda tax advocates of the change in October and the Campaign for Healthy Kids removed declarations of support for soda taxes from its Web site.\nOfficials of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, who had encouraged Save the Children to advocate for soda taxes, are disappointed.\n\u201cThey were obviously some of the strongest out there working on the issue, and we had such high hopes,\u201d said Dwayne Proctor, team director for childhood obesity at the foundation. He said the two groups would continue to work together on other aspects of the obesity fight.",

    "text": "Nike Harnesses \u2018Girl Effect\u2019 Again\n2010-11-11T00:04:01.000Z\nFIFTEEN years ago, Nike made a splash with an advertising campaign known as \u201cIf you let me play.\u201d The ads drew considerable attention \u0097 and praise \u0097 because they advocated the benefits for girls and young women of participating in sports.\nToday, Nike\u2019s foundation is taking to heart the concept of \u201cgirl power\u201d that was embodied by the campaign, but now it is education, rather than sports, that is being celebrated for its transformative abilities. With an effort known as the Girl Effect, the Nike Foundation \u0097 supported by Nike and the NoVo Foundation \u0097 is trying to raise up adolescent girls in poverty-plagued, developing regions of the world. \nHelping those girls to become better educated, the Girl Effect\u2019s Web site asserts, helps them as well as \u201ctheir families, their communities and their nations.\u201d \nData on the site shows that positive changes can come in areas like health (the more schooling mothers get, the healthier their infants and children will be) and income (an additional year of secondary school will increase a girl\u2019s wages by 15 to 25 percent).\n\u201cWhy girls?\u201d the site asks. \u201cBecause when we all invest in girls, everyone wins.\u201d\nThe initiative is an example of what is called cause marketing or purpose marketing. The term refers to campaigns that assist what companies deem pro-social causes to improve the world \u0097 and, not incidentally, improve how current and prospective customers perceive them. \n\u201cWith the Girl Effect, we see the best of Nike\u201d and the best of\u2019 cause marketing, said Mike Swenson, president of Barkley, an agency in Kansas City, Mo., that is active in cause marketing but is not involved in the Nike effort.\nNike is \u201cusing one of its greatest assets, global reach, to shine a light on a problem that nobody owns,\u201d Mr. Swenson said.\nLikewise, Carol Cone, managing director for brand and corporate citizenship at the Edelman public relations agency, praises the Girl Effect. In the fourth annual global Good Purpose survey, which Edelman released last week, Nike was ranked third by Americans among companies they considered to be placing as much or more importance on supporting a good cause as they placed on profits \u0097 behind only Pepsi-Cola and the Newman\u2019s Own line of food products.\n\u201cThe survey did not delve into specific brands with any further questions,\u201d Ms. Cone said, \u201cso we cannot comment explicitly on why this year\u2019s respondents choose Nike in particular.\u201d\n\u201cHowever, Nike has always been a brand known for innovation and pushing the boundaries of design and performance,\u201d she added. \u201cNow, it\u2019s applying this same expertise and pioneer attitude to the cause of women and girls around the world.\u201d\n Ms. Cone, an expert in cause marketing, cited the \u201cviral movement\u201d created by the Girl Effect as evidence that it was \u201ccaptivating consumers.\u201d For instance, the video clips on the Web site have been watched more than 1.7 million times.\nOne reason that the Girl Effect appears to resonate so strongly is that advertisements for Nike products have long portrayed the company as \u201ca champion of human potential,\u201d as the authors of the book \u201cGood for Business: The Rise of the Conscious Corporation\u201d (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009) describe the company. \nTackling the problems of poor girls in countries like Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Liberia appears congruent with that image, particularly as Nike has continued to champion the cause of women\u2019s athletics through ad campaigns and Web sites like nikewomen.com.\nIt is the \u201cNike way\u201d to \u201cpick some really big issue\u201d to work on, said Leslie Lane, vice president and managing director of the Nike Foundation in Beaverton, Ore., which has about 25 staff members and spends about $30 million a year.\nMaria Eitel, president and chief executive of the foundation, along with Phil Knight, chairman of Nike, chose as their \u201cbest investment,\u201d Mr. Lane said, an effort to \u201cbreak the cycle of intergenerational poverty\u201d in poor countries by focusing on \u201cthe future mother of every child born into poverty.\u201d\n\u201cEverything that happens to her in adolescence\u201d will have a profound effect on her and her family\u2019s future, he added, which led to the decision to concentrate on adolescent girls \u201cversus a sector like health or a disease like H.I.V.\u201d\nThe Girl Effect is purposely \u201cnot branded as Nike,\u201d Mr. Lane said, which could quell skeptics of the initiative who claim it has commercial intent.\nAnother reason \u201cnot having the swoosh\u201d is beneficial, he added, referring to the brand\u2019s familiar symbol, is that the effort can more directly address issues of public policy without seeming to be directed by Nike\u2019s business needs.\n (Nike has branded cause marketing campaigns; all profits from the sales of products in the Livestrong Collection are donated to Lance Armstrong\u2019s Livestrong Foundation.)\nWhen it comes to the Girl Effect, \u201cpeople do say, \u2018What is in it for Nike?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Lane acknowledged. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously a benefit to the brand when people say Nike and the Nike Foundation is behind it.\u201d\n\u201cBut we really do not have a commercial footprint in a significant way\u201d in the countries at which the Girl Effect is aimed, he added.\n Nor is the initiative intended to \u201coffset any issues\u201d that come up between consumers and Nike in areas like labor, Mr. Lane said.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t say, \u2018It\u2019s bad here, but look how good we are here,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s just not the way we operate.\u201d",

    "text": "Capturing the Vitality of Jackson Heights and Putting It on Stage\n2010-05-05T01:29:36.000Z\nWhen Ari Laura Kreith moved to Jackson Heights, Queens, from California in 2005, it was not the 100 nationalities that are said to be represented in the neighborhood that captivated her. After all, California is a pretty diverse place, too.\nWhat made Jackson Heights unique, in Ms. Kreith\u2019s view, was that it had none of the ethnic dividers she had encountered elsewhere, \u201cno bubbles isolating one community from the next,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI had the feeling I was seamlessly dropping in and out of all these different cultures just by walking down the street,\u201d said Ms. Kreith, who studied theater at Yale and whose first job after college was as an assistant to the playwright David Mamet.\nHer amazement turned into curiosity, which turned into excitement \u2014 an emotional jumble that Ms. Kreith said she had experienced before, whenever an idea popped into her head during her time running a theater group she started in Davis, Calif.\nHer idea finally came to fruition when she managed to do what she knows best: encapsulate Jackson Heights in a play.\nIt took 11 playwrights, 25 scenes, 29 actors and 37 characters to pull off. The result is \u201c167 Tongues\u201d, a title that refers to the number of languages believed to be spoken in Queens and is a nod to Jackson Heights\u2019s multiethnic fabric.\nThe play, which opens on Friday at Public School 69, is a production of the Jackson Repertory Theater, which was created in 2008 to bring affordable professional productions to a pocket of Queens where cultural activities are rare. \n The play\u2019s writers and cast are a microcosm of Jackson Heights, a neighborhood that many demographers believe is the most diverse in the country. \nMs. Kreith recruited them in unusual places and in unlikely ways. She found Les Hunter at a local cafe after she peered over his shoulder at the play he was writing on his laptop. She met Lauren Currie Lewis, who plays a pregnant Ecuadorean teenager named Leti, through her other job as a consultant, hiring actors to play patients in role-playing exercises with medical students.\nWriting a play collectively requires organizational guidelines: an author develops a theme and doles out assignments to the writers. But this exercise unfolded differently. The playwrights went on a guided tour of Jackson Heights the first time they met and then convened around a big desk to draw a map of what they had just seen, complete with the streets, places and people they could remember.\n\u201cIt was sort of like, forget about accuracy and scale. Focus on whatever caught your attention,\u201d said one of the writers, Anna Kushner, a Cuban-American who grew up in Philadelphia and has lived in Jackson Heights for five years. \nThey sat in a circle on the floor of Ms. Kreith\u2019s apartment on 80th Street, came up with a character, wrote a basic description of the character on an index card and passed the card to the person next to them, who had to create a pair of characters with whom the original one might interact. \nBy then, many of the playwrights had spent time roaming around Jackson Heights on their own, eavesdropping on conversations, asking questions and observing. They were inspired by real people, like the men seen dancing the tango at a gay bar on Roosevelt Avenue, a bookseller who works two days a week from a sidewalk table at the corner of 37th Avenue and 76th Street, and a manicurist who doubles as a therapist to her customers. \nThe bookseller drives a van that he parks on the street overnight, not far from his books, which he leaves on a table, shielded by thick plastic. Mr. Hunter, who is studying for a doctorate in English at Stony Brook University and who also lives in Jackson Heights, said he had never talked with the man, but imagined that he stayed awake in the van all night, guarding his possessions from thieves. \nHe had heard that the bookseller was from the former Yugoslavia, but Mr. Hunter conceived of him as Russian. The part is played by Arje Shaw, the son of a Holocaust survivor who makes a living writing novels and plays that have run on and off Broadway. The manicurist was inspired by the woman who does Ms. Kushner\u2019s nails and who, upon meeting one of Ms. Kushner\u2019s friends who was dealing with relationship problems, dispensed such valuable advice that the friend has not since had a manicure from anybody else. \nNo one knows anything about the men who were dancing the tango. One of the playwrights spotted them and another, Rehana Mirza, used them in one of her scenes. \nThe characters in the play were changed just enough so that they would not be instantly recognizable, Ms. Kreith said.\nSome of them \u201crub against one another,\u201d she added, their stories interlaced across scenes. For example, Leti, the pregnant teenager, has a Bangladeshi friend named Tasleema, who steals contraceptive pills from her mother\u2019s pharmacy. She gives the pills to Leti, who hopes that by taking them all at once, she can mimic the effects of the morning-after pill. Spanish is used liberally throughout the play (there will be placards with English translations), and English is spoken with a variety of accents. The dramaturge, Angie Balsamo, doubles as the dialect coach, teaching actors how someone from Russia, Mexico or Tibet would pronounce the same English word.\nMore than a collection of short plays, the scenes are interwoven narratives, or \u201ca collage,\u201d said one of the playwrights, Alvin Eng , the son of Chinese immigrants who settled in Flushing, Queens. \u201cThey\u2019re all elements of the same portrait.\u201d\nMs. Lewis, who lives in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, said the play \u201cis like all of New York City squeezed into a neighborhood, and then the whole neighborhood squeezed into characters and scenes.\u201d \nThe performances will be held in the cafeteria of the school, at 77-02 37th Avenue. Ms. Kreith, who is also the theater group\u2019s artistic director, wanted it that way because it allowed seats to be arranged so that the audience surrounded the area where the actors perform.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about making the people who are our inspiration not our backdrop,\u201d she said, \u201cbut part of the action.\u201d",

    "text": "China Shifts Away From Low-Cost Factories\n2010-09-15T16:46:44.000Z\nDONGGUAN, China \u0097 Companies here in China\u2019s industrial heartland are toiling to reinvent their businesses, fearing that the low-cost manufacturing that helped propel the nation\u2019s economic ascent is fast becoming obsolete.\nThe TAL Group, which operates an immense garment-making plant in this coastal boom town, is moving beyond piecework by helping J. C. Penney electronically manage its inventory of dress shirts, from factory floor to retail shelves as far away as Connecticut. \nChicony, maker of a power device used in the Xbox from Microsoft and a major supplier of computer keyboards to Dell, is diversifying by opening department stores, with three so far around China and seven more planned.\nAnd after years of assembling vacuum cleaners and rechargeable toothbrushes for Philips and other Western companies, Kwonnie Electrical Products is planning its own line of home appliances.\n\u201cWe want to do more original design and build our own brand,\u201d Benjamin Kwok, a company founder, said during a recent tour of a sprawling factory complex that has 3,000 workers, a huge warehouse and labs for testing juice makers, vacuum cleaners and other appliances. \n\u201cMany customers won\u2019t be happy with the decision to compete with them,\u201d Mr. Kwok said. \u201cBut we have no choice.\u201d\nIt is too soon to know whether such makeovers will succeed. But economists consider such efforts necessary \u0097 and overdue. \nFor years, factories here in the Pearl River Delta region have served as the low-cost workshops for global brands, turning this part of China into the nation\u2019s biggest export zone. The city of Dongguan, about 35 miles northwest of Hong Kong, has long churned out toys, textiles, furniture and sports shoes \u0097 including hundreds of millions of sneakers a year for companies like Nike and Adidas.\nBut now, with manufacturing costs rising and China looking to create a consumer middle class, experts say the revamping of this region\u2019s industries could help reduce the nation\u2019s wide income gap and encourage more balanced and sustainable economic growth. \n \u201cIt is my hope that China\u2019s comparative advantage as a low-wage producer does disappear \u0097 the sooner the better,\u201d Fan Gang, an economics professor at Peking University, wrote in a recent essay, adding that China needed to upgrade and embark on \u201cthe next stage of development.\u201d\nManufacturing costs have risen rapidly here in response to nagging labor shortages and worker demands for higher wages to help offset soaring food and property prices. \nThose pressures were evident a few months ago, when a series of big labor strikes in southern China disrupted several Japanese auto factories and resulted in hefty pay raises.\nThere is also the looming prospect that China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, will strengthen against other world currencies in the coming years. That would make goods produced here even more expensive to export, and further erode what manufacturers say are already thin profit margins.\nSeeking lower costs, some Pearl River Delta factories are relocating to poor inland regions of China where wages are as much as 30 percent lower than in coastal provinces. Other factories are moving to lower-wage countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam.\nBut for companies that have invested billions of dollars in factories here, simply packing up and pulling out is not always financially feasible. That is why many owners of Dongguan factories are experimenting with other solutions. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve decided that we\u2019re not going to be on the low end,\u201d says Roger Lee, the chief operating officer at TAL Apparel, part of the TAL Group. \nTAL, which is based in Hong Kong and says it makes one of every six dress shirts sold in the United States, is expanding into supply-chain management for J. C. Penney, one of its big shirt-buyers. Through an extensive computerized system, TAL can stock and restock shirt shelves in all 1,100 of Penney\u2019s retail stores in the United States, as demand warrants.\n\u201cToo much inventory kills retailers,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cNow, we\u2019re managing inventory in each store. We gets sales data. We know what\u2019s in the warehouse, what\u2019s on the boat. We help reduce inventory.\u201d\nTAL is a fortunate survivor. After the global financial crisis hit, Dongguan\u2019s exports plummeted by about 25 percent. Thousands of factories simply closed. Now \u0097 even though exports have rebounded to 2008 levels \u0097 there are worries that regional growth is slowing drastically. \n\u201cSince 2008, the investment environment has worsened in Dongguan,\u201d said Lin Jiang, a professor of finance at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou. \u201cA lot of companies don\u2019t see a future in Dongguan. And they feel pressure from the government to upgrade.\u201d\nIn Qingxi, an economic zone in the southeastern part of Dongguan, district government officials are trying to help desperate factories adjust to the new realities. If many companies are reluctant to leave, the local government is just as loath to lose the companies and their tax revenue. \nThe 56-square-mile Qingxi district is crowded with textile and electronics factories, mostly backed by companies from Hong Kong and Taiwan, that produce for global brands like Burberry, Hewlett-Packard and Sony.\nThe country\u2019s export boom helped Qingxi transform vast tracts of farmland into bustling factories with noisy assembly lines. That created enormous wealth for the country and the local region. But the labor equation is rapidly changing. \nYears ago, migrant workers lined up outside factories here hoping to apply for work. As a result, 90 percent of Qingxi\u2019s 350,000 residents are migrant workers. Most of them traveled from China\u2019s poor interior provinces to find factory jobs that today often pay about 90 cents an hour, which is the typical wage in the Shenzhen-Dongguan area. \n But a demographic shift tied to the nation\u2019s one-child policy means fewer young people are entering the work force. And government efforts to improve conditions in the interior provinces have lifted growth in those regions and persuaded many young workers to find jobs closer to home. \nSo companies here can no longer pick and choose among workers. \n\u201cWe used to prefer women because they are easier to manage,\u201d said Frank Chen, a manager at a Qingxi factory called Lite-On Technology, which makes Internet-access cards for Wi-Fi devices. \u201cBefore, we wanted three females for every male. But because of the labor shortage, it\u2019s hard to get that ratio now.\u201d\nChicony, trying to drum up workers, has taken to sending a bus around Dongguan with a loudspeaker blaring, \u201cChicony is the best.\u201d\nBecause of labor shortages and government efforts to raise the minimum wage to improve the livelihoods of migrant workers, pay rates in the Shenzhen-Dongguan area have nearly doubled in the last five years.\nStill, factories here often have to pay middlemen and vocational schools to find migrant labor. The Qingxi government has also tried to step in, organizing recruiting drives into the country\u2019s poorest regions.\nBut longer term, district officials want to encourage innovation. \nZhu Guorong, the vice director of the Qingxi Office of Trade and Economic Cooperation, is among those trying to remake Qingxi. Recently, he drove a sparkling blue Toyota FJ Cruiser \u0097 a kind of miniature Hummer \u0097 through the city\u2019s economic zones, talking about the shift under way.\n\u201cEvery company now wants to be a high-tech company, and we want to encourage them,\u201d Mr. Zhu said, as he headed for an electronics factory, where he would inquire about profitability. \nThe national government has preferential tax policies to encourage technology companies, and the Qingxi district government has a research and development fund \u0097 officials decline to say how much money it has \u0097 to support efforts. \nOne company that has already received government money for research and development is a division of Lite-On Technology, the electronics supplier.\nBut even for innovators like TAL, the garment maker, success is far from guaranteed. \n\u201cThe price of a shirt has gone down,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cBut our costs have gone up.\u201d",

    "text": "An Old Synagogue Downsizes in a Desperate Bid to Keep Itself Alive\n2010-01-09T03:20:30.000Z\n Jerry Banberger scarcely observed any of his tribe\u2019s rituals, but after watching the twin towers collapse from the roof of his Queens loft, he felt a primal need to say Kaddish. \nSo he wandered into the Sunnyside Jewish Center, and ended up staying long enough to say a kind of Kaddish \u0097 a mourners\u2019 prayer \u0097 for the synagogue building itself. Once flush with 1,500 members, the congregation had fewer than 50, who could no longer afford the building\u2019s upkeep.\nWithin four years, the grand edifice that had hosted teeming Yom Kippur services and countless bar mitzvahs was sold to and torn down by a developer, leaving a rubble-strewn lot. \nBut unlike many of his broken-hearted members, Mr. Banberger, who had become the Jewish center\u2019s president, did not simply grieve. \nUsing some of the $4.9 million from the sale of the old building, he has resurrected the synagogue in what was a two-family house a few blocks away. The new basement prayer space is what many Jews might have dismissed as a shtibl, a little prayer room, but Mr. Banberger is working with an architect to a remodel it for a synagogue look.\nStill, Mr. Banberger, a tall, bearded 66-year-old graphic designer whom other members call \u201cthe new kid on the block,\u201d acknowledges that it is a desperate roll of the dice. \u201cSo you might call me a dreamer,\u201d he said. \u201cYeh, I\u2019m a dreamer, but sometimes fantasies become reality.\u201d\nConservative and Reform temples have been closing or merging across Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx for decades now as younger non-Orthodox Jews moved away. There are 35 Conservative and 3 Reform synagogues left in Queens, compared with the 43 Conservative and 8 Reform ones of two decades ago, said Cynthia Zalisky, executive director of the Queens Jewish Community Council. Many of those still standing are remnants of their former glory, so the writing is on the eastern wall. \n\u201cYou have a lot of vitality, but the old cathedral kind of synagogue is an exception,\u201d said Jacob B. Ukeles, who did a study of the region\u2019s Jewish population for UJA-Federation of New York in 2002. \nOnly Orthodox houses of worship seem to be on the upswing, with 115 synagogues that have attracted not just the adult children of booming pious communities like that in Kew Gardens Hills, but also new immigrants like those from Uzbekistan. \nAt the Sunnyside Jewish Center, a Conservative synagogue there has not been a bar mitzvah for more than a year. On most Sabbaths, it can barely scrape together a minyan, the quorum of 10 men preferred for Torah reading and Kaddish, and often does so with the help of kindly souls from a neighboring Orthodox synagogue. \nYes, during the High Holy Days, the synagogue was packed, \u201cwall to wall,\u201d said one member, Sonya Moritz, but hers is not an especially grand boast, considering that the basement room holds only 45 folding chairs.\nThere is no rabbi. The rabbi for 51 years, Irwin Albert, a central-casting figure with a lush white beard, retired and moved to Israel four years ago, then died. So when questions of Jewish law crop up, Mr. Banberger consults an Orthodox rabbi in Astoria. There is only one congregant who reads from the Torah in Hebrew, and when he is away on business, the Torah is read in English. \n\u201cA little something is better than nothing,\u201d Mr. Banberger apologizes.\n Mr. Banberger even dredged up his teenage trombone skills to teach himself how to blow the shofar on Rosh Hashana. \n\u201cTypically, the guy who blows it is a righteous man, keeps kosher and all that,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t tell you what I do and don\u2019t do, but I am getting better.\u201d\nNevertheless, there is a kind of plaintive nostalgia for the old shul, built in 1939. The widowed Mrs. Moritz, 78, remembers when there were 600 diners in the rooftop sukkah, the makeshift shack inhabited for the Sukkot holiday.\nBut her life\u2019s arc offers testimony on the synagogue\u2019s closing. She grew up in a family that owned Felenstein\u2019s, a candy store that claimed the best egg creams in Sunnyside. But her three daughters live in different towns in New York and New Jersey. \nHer friend Fred Brenner, who is 92, summed it up: \u201cNobody lives where they were born,\u201d he said.\nSince the 1980s, the newcomers to Sunnyside, once a largely Irish neighborhood with a Jewish minority, have been predominantly immigrants from Korea, Colombia, Romania and Bangladesh. Mr. Banberger believes there are young Jews scattered among them, and urges the members to seek them out in everyday life.\n\u201cI tell them, \u2018You\u2019re my first line of defense, my emissaries,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \nHe is no stranger to declining Jewish neighborhoods. He grew up in the East Bronx when, he remembers with more sentimentality than accuracy, there was a synagogue on every block along Washington Avenue, and sometimes two. \nBut a certain Moses (Robert, the master builder and power broker) tore down his shul to make way for the Cross Bronx Expressway, and a neighborhood exodus resulted. \nIn Sunnyside, he wants to retain as much of the old spiritual home as possible in the $1.3 million renovation. Plans call for the facade to be embellished with a copper menorah taken from the old shul, as well as a Holy Ark built of elements from the old Holy Ark. He plans to reupholster the thronelike blue-velvet officers\u2019 chairs, and has kept the old prayer books, prayers shawls and memorial plaques. \nBut he will add some modern touches, like an elevator acceptable for use on the Sabbath to help the elderly up to the second floor, where services in the new 90-seat synagogue will be held. He has even put aside space for classrooms, though so far there are no children to fill them.\nThough Mr. Banberger is optimistic about the prospects, the congregation is sometimes lost without a rabbi. It could help solve the quorum problem by counting women, as many Conservative synagogues have done, but the members are fiercely traditional, and even the women do not want to be counted, Mrs. Moritz said. \n \u201cThey would resent that,\u201d Mr. Banberger said, \u201cand I didn\u2019t want to lose any more.\u201d",

    "text": "In Scarred Land, a Haven for Victims of Acid Burns\n2010-08-24T01:28:10.000Z\nTRAPAENG VENG, Cambodia \u0097 Touch Eap stroked her husband\u2019s scarred and discolored back as she described the night six years ago when she poured a tub of acid over his head, burning off his eyes and ears and lips and leaving him as dependent on her as a child. \n\u201cI wanted to kill him,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to injure him. He said he would kill me, and I thought, better to kill him first so that I can take care of the children.\u201d \nShe smiled ruefully as she talked; his drunkenness and threats were an old memory. Her husband, Phoeung Phoeur, 45, opened his mouth in what may also have been a smile. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for him,\u201d said Ms. Touch Eap, 46, who grows vegetables to support her husband and three children, \u201cand I try to take care of him.\u201d \nIt was a moment of domestic tranquillity here in Cambodia\u2019s only shelter for acid burn victims, where a dozen other mutilated residents napped or sang or hung their heads backward in an exercise to help keep their scarred necks flexible. \nCambodia, along with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, has a history of acid attacks \u0097 a rare and extreme form of revenge or punishment.\nAn increase in the number of reported attacks in Cambodia, with 17 so far this year, has drawn attention to this shelter, the nonprofit Cambodian Acid Survivors Charity, on the outskirts of Phnom Penh.\nThe center has been advising the government in drafting a law that is making its way slowly through the legislature. The proposed law would restrict sales of acid \u0097 now widely and cheaply available \u0097 require warning labels and impose sentences of up to life in prison for the most severe attacks. \nThe center\u2019s residents, who receive medical and psychological care, physical therapy, and occupational training, are just a few of the more than 280 known victims in Cambodia of a form of revenge that illustrates an undercurrent of violence that courses through this wounded society. Experts say the true number is certainly far higher. \n\u201cThis is a traumatized culture,\u201d said Pin Domnang, chief of programs and administration at the center, referring to decades of mass killings and civil war. \u201cWhen something happens, the only response is violence. Violence can solve their problems. Violence can make them feel better.\u201d \nShort of murder, advocates say, an acid attack is the most devastating form of aggression, transforming the victim into a figure of horror and an outcast in a society that often sees disfigurement as a form of karmic justice. \nThat thought is an unexpected comfort to one of the survivors here, Soum Bunnarith, 41, a former salesman whose wife blinded him with acid five years ago in a rage of jealousy. \u201cI ask myself, \u2018Why me?\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cBut then I think maybe I did terrible things in a past life, and that thought helps me to accept this.\u201d \nSome, rejected and without family members to care for them, take their lives in despair, Mr. Pin Domnang said. \u201cTheir identity changes, their whole life changes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is difficult to control the food in their mouths. Sometimes it spills out. \n\u201cTheir families don\u2019t want to see them, don\u2019t want to come to visit them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe trauma in their spirit is like they are gone. They don\u2019t want to live on this earth any more.\u201d \nOthers, spurred by anger, try to pursue their attackers in court. Under current laws, acid attacks are generally treated as civil assault cases in which the victim must press charges. In a system governed by power, money and influence, there have been few convictions. Nevertheless, the center\u2019s medical and legal manager, Dr. Horng Lairapo, has been encouraging victims to file new cases and revive old ones. \nOne of those victims is Mean Sok Reoun, 35, who was attacked and blinded by her husband\u2019s former wife 15 years ago. Until recently, she said, her attacker had lived freely after paying a bribe to the police, while Ms. Mean Sok Reoun endured 40 operations. \n\u201cI saw her clearly running away,\u201d said Ms. Mean Sok Reoun, whose eyes moved rapidly behind a curtain of skin as she talked. \u201cBut then I saw only shadows. And then I was blind.\u201d \nZiad Samman, the center\u2019s project manager, said, \u201cThe attacks are not always the products of jealous rage; some grow out of other personal or business disputes.\u201d \nAcid is widely available for uses like maintaining machinery, clearing drains and polishing jewelry. It is used in the processing of rubber, and a high proportion of attacks have come in areas near plantations, according to the center. In rural areas where there is no electricity, acid fuels the car batteries that are used to power television sets.\nIt was battery acid that Ms. Touch Eap said she poured over her husband\u2019s head as he sat drinking in their home six years ago, a large knife by his side. \n\u201c\u00a0\u2018Do what I say or I\u2019ll kill you\u2019 \u0097 those were the last words I said to her,\u201d said Mr. Phoeung Phoeur, joining his wife in the narrative as their 13-year-old daughter, Per Srey Ai, looked on. \nIf he was going to live, Mr. Phoeung Phoeur said, he realized he needed his wife. As soon as he reached the hospital, he begged a friend to pay the police to set her free. Ms. Touch Eap returned to him, and she has nursed and supported her husband ever since she tried to kill him. \nShe was with him at the hospital when doctors told him he had only hours left to live, and she walked alongside him as neighbors carried him home in a hammock to die. She lighted incense and prayed beside him as he slipped in and out of consciousness until, defying the doctors\u2019 predictions, he returned to life. \n\u201cWe called all the family around him,\u201d she said, remembering that dark evening. \u201cWe were all waiting around him, waiting for him to die. I was so afraid he was going to die.\u201d",

    "text": "YouTube Withdraws Cleric\u2019s Videos\n2010-11-04T00:22:26.000Z\nLONDON \u0097 Under pressure from American and British officials, YouTube on Wednesday removed from its site some of the hundreds of videos featuring calls to jihad by Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born, Yemen-based cleric who has played an increasingly public role in inspiring violence directed at the West. \n Last week, a British official pressed for the videos to be removed and a New York congressman, Anthony Weiner, sent YouTube a letter listing hundreds of videos featuring the cleric. The requests took on greater urgency after two powerful bombs hidden in cargo planes were intercepted en route from Yemen to Chicago on Friday, with the prime suspect being the Yemen-based group Mr. Awlaki is affiliated with, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. \nIn an e-mail, Victoria Grand, a YouTube spokeswoman, said that the site had removed videos that violated the site\u2019s guidelines prohibiting \u201cdangerous or illegal activities such as bomb-making, hate speech, and incitement to commit violent acts,\u201d or came from accounts \u201cregistered by a member of a designated foreign terrorist organization,\u201d or used to promote such a group\u2019s interests. \nMs. Grand said that Google, YouTube\u2019s owner, sought to balance freedom of expression with averting calls to violence. \u201cThese are difficult issues,\u201d she wrote, \u201cand material that is brought to our attention is reviewed carefully. We will continue to remove all content that incites violence according to our policies. Material of a purely religious nature will remain on the site.\u201d \n In an interview, Mr. Weiner said that YouTube gave him a \u201cbureaucratic\u201d response at first, but seemed to take his request more seriously after the bombs were found. \u201cIt has become increasingly clear that this guy is an international terrorist that is using their service to do illegal things,\u201d he said.\nBritain\u2019s concern over Mr. Awlaki and his group rose sharply on Wednesday with two developments. A young woman who had embraced his cause and watched dozens of hours of his videos was sentenced to life in prison for the attempted murder in May of a prominent legislator, and a top official in the government of Prime Minister David Cameron announced that a member of the Yemeni Qaeda group had been arrested earlier in the year in a previously undisclosed bombing plot against the country. \n Britain\u2019s security agencies have wrestled with dozens of terrorist plots in recent years, successfully foiling most but suffering deeply from the attack on the London transit system in July 2005, which left 56 people, including four suicide bombers, dead.\n In recent months, top security officials here have issued a series of warnings, saying that an increasingly dire threat came from groups inspired by Osama bin Laden based in Yemen, Somalia and North Africa. \nJonathan Evans, chief of Britain\u2019s domestic intelligence agency, MI5, said recently that Mr. Awlaki and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula were \u201cof particular concern\u201d in the light of their role in the attempted bombing on Dec. 25 of an American trans-Atlantic airliner approaching Detroit, and \u201cbecause he preaches and teaches in the English language, which makes his message easier to access and understand for Western audiences.\u201d \nScotland Yard detectives who investigated the attack on the legislator said outside the court that 21-year-old Roshonara Choudhury, a theology student, watched YouTube videos that showed sequences from sermons by Mr. Awlaki in Yemen in which the preacher urged Muslims everywhere to join in a worldwide holy war against the West. In a transcript of her interrogation published by The Guardian, she spoke of watching hundreds of hours of his videos. She said her motive was to \u201cpunish\u201d the legislator, Stephen Timms, for voting in 2003 for Britain\u2019s participation in the invasion of Iraq. \nHer lawyer told the court that Ms. Choudhury, whose parents immigrated to England from Bangladesh, had been a Muslim moderate \u201cof exemplary character\u201d with no links to terrorist groups until she began browsing militant Muslim Web sites.\nWhen she attacked, as Mr. Timms met with constituents at his office in a London suburb, she was wearing a black floor-length gown and a head covering that revealed only her eyes. She pulled out a knife and stabbed him twice in the abdomen. \nMs. Choudhury refused to attend the trial, saying she did not recognize the legitimacy of the British court system. But she appeared by video link from a prison in London for Wednesday\u2019s sentencing, when the judge, Sir Jeremy Cooke, said that she would have to serve a minimum of 15 years before applying for parole. He described Ms. Choudhury as \u201can intelligent young woman who has absorbed immoral ideas and wrong patterns of thinking,\u201d and added: \u201cYou do not suffer from any mental disease. You have simply committed evil acts coolly and deliberately.\u201d\n YouTube has faced other periods of pressure to remove videos linked to radical Islamists. Jeffrey Rosen, a professor of law at George Washington University who has written extensively about YouTube\u2019s policies, including in The New York Times Magazine, said that in 2007, the Labour Government in Britain called on YouTube to block terrorist recruitment videos featuring Islamic fighters with guns and rockets. \nLast May, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman\u2019s staff asked Google to remove about 120 terrorist recruitment videos from YouTube. Google removed some videos that showed gratuitous violence or hate speech, but refused to take down others.\n \u201cYouTube and Google deserve credit for trying to distinguish videos that are merely offensive from those that show graphic violence or hate speech or risk inciting imminent violence, which is the line American courts have drawn in free speech cases since the 1960s,\u201d Professor Rosen said.

    "text": "My Nine Years as a Middle-Eastern American\n2010-09-11T22:17:10.000Z\nIN the late \u201990s and early \u201900s, I used to frequent a boutique in the East Village called Michael and Hushi. Hushi Mortezaie, an impish club kid born in Iran and raised in the Bay Area, made outlandish, psychedelic, robot-chic clothing and was getting the coolest of the East Village cool kids to wear his strategically slashed and torn Farsi-graffitied shirts, though none of them had any idea that in some cases they were bearing post-Iranian Revolution political slogans.\nI \u2014 born in Iran, raised in the Los Angeles area \u2014 used to go to downtown parties in a skimpy halter top that featured newsprint-emblazoned mujahideen women brandishing machine guns, their bullets bedazzled in gold next to the words \u201cLong Live Iran.\u201d It was the first time I had worn anything having to do with my homeland; I loved that feeling of for once being able to both be Iranian and a play on it.\nIn one of the last days of August 2001, I remember being at the boutique again, and Hushi was giddy preparing for Fashion Week. His store windows were freshly adorned with his \u201cPersian collection,\u201d a new line of hijab-and-harem-pant Iranophilia. \u201cGirl, get ready!\u201d he said, \u201cIran is going to be the new black.\u201d\nDays later, there we were, two Middle Eastern 20-somethings who now had some explaining to do. Friends started speaking in roundabout inquiries: What exactly was the status of my green card? How were my father and brother faring? Were they Muslim, by the way?\nHushi\u2019s stylists, meanwhile, were calling him to ask how he was \u2014 and when he was going to be getting rid of that window display. But somehow we really were fine, even under the heavy air of everyone\u2019s condescending concern.\nLittle did we know that it would take almost a full decade for the proverbial 9/11 fallout to fall out, for anti-Muslim xenophobia to emerge, fully formed and fever-pitched, ostensibly over plans to build an interfaith cultural center near ground zero. Even in New York, stronghold of progressive ethics and cultural diversity, my former home of 12 years, August 2010 became the evil twin of that still-innocent August 2001.\nIn addition to the mosque, of course, there was the Florida pastor who wanted to burn Korans on the Sept. 11 anniversary, and who has yes-no-maybe-so reconsidered, after a hearty load of negative press and a dab of executive-branch headshaking. And, hey, what do you get when you put a drunk white college student, who had actually been to Afghanistan, into the cab of a Bangladeshi Muslim? The wrong answer and a stabbing, allegedly.\nIt\u2019s one test I would have passed. For the record: I am not Muslim. My immediate family ultimately kept us as agnostic as possible; religion went only as far as my mother praying to the American concept of a guardian angel and my dad \u201cstudying\u201d Zoroastrianism. But most of the extended Khakpours are Muslim and, culturally, it\u2019s a part of me insofar as I am a Middle Easterner.\nI am also a New Yorker, a deal that was sealed forever nine years ago. I had just moved from Brooklyn to downtown Manhattan to shack up with a boyfriend. The studio was 25 floors up, with a nearly all-glass wall that framed a perfect view of the World Trade Center.\nNow, when I look back on ages 23 to 32, every aspect of my life is shadowed by what I saw through the glass that blue-and-gold Tuesday morning: two towers, each gashed and stunningly hazed in the glitter of exploding windows, falling, one after the other, over and over again. But what was once simple apprehension and mortification and trepidation has become increasingly entangled with feelings of exhaustion and marginalization and even indignation.\n\n\u2022\n\nA deep dark admission: lately \u2014 and by lately I mean this era I worked so hard for, when a liberal person of color, a man who resembles my own father, would be our president \u2014 I\u2019ve found myself thinking secretly, were certain things better in the George W. Bush era? Was it easier to be Middle Eastern then?\nJust six days after 9/11, at the Islamic Center of Washington, President Bush said, \u201cThose who feel like they can intimidate our fellow citizens to take out their anger don\u2019t represent the best of America, they represent the worst of humankind.\u201d He added: \u201cThe face of terror is not the true faith of Islam. That\u2019s not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace.\u201d Did that assurance mean more to white Americans coming from someone who looked like them?\nXenophobia and racism still abounded, but the lid stayed on the pot. Perhaps when Republicans held both the White House and Congress, conservatives weren\u2019t sweating a thing; for them, people of color, along with all our white liberal friends, were lumped together in one misery-loves-company fringe. But now that the tables have turned, conservatives have positioned themselves as aggrieved victims. (I recall the advice of an older female relative: Always let men you\u2019re in relationships with have all the power; it\u2019s when they lose power and get insecure that your problems start.)\nIndeed, has the most irrational breed of 9/11 payback emerged precisely because we elected an African-American president whose middle name \u2014 the name of cousins of mine \u2014 has turned into an H-word slur? A commander in chief whom the most misled and confused perceive in cartoon cahoots with terrorists, or at least as their religion-mate? As if that weren\u2019t enough, take last year\u2019s Fort Hood gunman, add a helping of the would-be Times Square bomber and top it off with \u201cground zero mosque\u201d \u2014 and voil\u00e0, a boiling hot summer of anti-Islamic assault. Suddenly, anyone with skin as dark as President Obama\u2019s could be a \u201csecret Muslim,\u201d and any Muslim must surely be a not-so-secret terrorist.\nThe world Hushi and I were in, before 9/11 and just after, was not a picnic for brown people. And there\u2019s no need to cast 2001 to 2008 in an ideal light. None of us breathed easy. It\u2019s just that we expected to breathe easier as time went on.\n\n\u2022\n\nMy brother, who lives in Brooklyn, recently discovered that many of his Muslim friends in New York felt that the Islamic cultural center was a bad idea to begin with, for this sole reason: it was going to put them in danger. He and his friends feel a fear that they haven\u2019t in ages, or ever.\nDuring our late-night calls, my brother and I talk about nothing but what\u2019s on the news, and we laugh a lot, but we laugh nervously. My sense of humor, honed in my immigrant childhood, was always my ultimate disarming mechanism, a handy way to infuse the blues with some off color.\nThis was my modus operandi during a book tour in 2007, when 90 percent of my Q-and-A\u2019s were about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran\u2019s notorious president, as my publication date coincided with his infamous visit to Columbia University. It was annoying and even baffling, because it had nothing to do with me or the book. But I laughed and joked with the audience so that it was clear to them I was, like, totally un-Ahmadinejad, dudes.\nThe hilarity started to curdle at the moment I was also feeling the most euphoric: during Mr. Obama\u2019s bid for the presidency. It was around then that I began murdering whole days on the Internet, and not just on the Internet but in its dirty basement, the comments sections of blogs. There, an angry tribe of fake names spoke in misspelled obscenities and declaimed the true, evil nature of Middle Easterners and their intentions in this country. This is silly, I\u2019d tell myself, these trolls aren\u2019t representative of my neighbors or of Americans.\nThen I\u2019d go on Facebook, and engage in more online warfare with friends of friends, real flesh-and-blood people with real-life names, who a bit more politely and grammatically stated the same. And there was me \u2014 a non-Muslim, who has publicly criticized certain Islamic practices \u2014 flaccidly battling for Muslims worldwide. It got to the point that I was telling people I didn\u2019t even know that their opinions were making my life downright \u201cunlivable.\u201d\nIt reminds me of how I used to experience so many mixed emotions when I\u2019d see women in full burqa in Brooklyn: alarm at the spectacle (no matter how many times I\u2019d seen it), followed by a certain feminist irk, and finally discomfiture at our cultural kinship. And then it would all turn into one strong emotion \u2014 protective rage \u2014 when I\u2019d see a group of teenagers laughing and pointing at them.\n\n\u2022\n\nEvery day, I lose America and America loses me, more and more. But I should still be in my honeymoon phase, since I\u2019m actually just a 9-year-old American. And that\u2019s my other association with autumn 2001. As luck would have it, my citizenship papers finally went through not long after the towers fell. That November, I was in a Brooklyn federal courtroom singing, along with a room full of immigrants, the national anthem that I hadn\u2019t sung since K through 12.\nI remember on that day, 9/11 leaving the foreground of my mind for the first time. I remember looking around that room and feeling, in spite of myself, a sense of optimism about the future. I remember feeling a part of something. I remember feeling thrilled at the official introduction of the hyphen that would from now on gracefully declare and demarcate my two worlds: Middle-Eastern-American. The same hyphen that today feels like a dagger that coarsely divides had once, not too long ago at all, been a symbol of a most hallowed bond.",

    "text": "A Photo Show Where Exposure Has Two Meanings\n2010-09-29T13:15:52.000Z\nPINGYAO, CHINA \u2014 PINGYAO, CHINA \u2014 With 2,200 photographers, the Pingyao International Photography Festival may be the largest event of its kind in the world. It is certainly the grittiest.\nMa Xiaobo, a Sichuan nature photographer, huddled under a tree next to his prints, which were covered in rain-soaked plastic sheeting. Showing wildlife shots in an outdoor setting might have seemed like a good idea until a storm hit and everyone else ran for cover.\nEven the indoor exhibitors were not entirely safe, as some of the abandoned factories used as temporary art spaces no longer had roofs. Plastic tarps strung between rusted ceiling beams flapped violently in the wind. Inside, Ouyang Xingkai displayed large, richly colored, almost painterly portraits of village life in Hunan. A staff member wiped them off after drizzle came through a broken window.\nThis ancient walled city in Shanxi Province was an unlikely place for a massive art show. But PIP, as the event is nicknamed, gained increased international attention in its 10th-anniversary edition, which ended Saturday. \nContributions by 2,200 photographers, including more than 200 from overseas, were shown in venues all over the city, including old factories, warehouses, temples, a historic magistrate\u2019s office and whatever outside walls people could find. \nWhile Pingyao\u2019s population, less than a half-million, is a small fraction of Beijing\u2019s, the juxtaposition of disused industrial spaces and contemporary art called to mind the early days of the capital\u2019s 798 district, a factory area that has grown into a fine-arts hub.\nThe setting was fitting, since much of the work from China documented down-and-dirty daily life. Pingyao\u2019s walled old city is a Unesco World Heritage site, but the area\u2019s industrial present often overshadows crumbling vestiges of the past. The environmental-themed works were particularly poignant, set in an area that is choked with coal dust. \n\u201cThey wanted to choose somewhere with history,\u201d Bai Xiaomei, the festival\u2019s public relations director and a Shanxi native, said when asked why organizers would pick this location. \u201cThis has always been a special destination for photographers.\u201d \nThe venue created some fascinating contexts. At the Brazilian group exhibit, two Chinese workers in fluorescent orange jumpsuits and hardhats stood transfixed in front of a photo by Michael Ende, showing a needle being injected into a prostitute\u2019s naked breast. \nTiago Santana, one of the Brazilian photographers, was on his first visit to China, but he wasn\u2019t put off by the difficult conditions in Pingyao. He even knew to bring waterproof, laminated prints because he once showed his works in an abandoned supermarket in his home state, Cear\u00e1. \n\u201cIt was in ruins \u2014 it didn\u2019t even have a roof,\u201d he said of the supermarket. \u201cIt was empty during the day, and used by drug dealers and prostitutes at night. We just threw images onto the walls.\u201d\nIt was also the first trip for Rebecca Dagnall, a photographer from Perth, Australia, who used modern-day photos to create post-Impressionist landscapes in the tradition of Australia\u2019s 19th-century Heidelberg Art School. Her dreamy landscapes, with people canoeing or children playing outside, are based on daily life in her country\u2019s outer suburbs.\n\u201cI love the space \u2014 all these old buildings,\u201d Ms. Dagnall said. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for this festival, I may never have come to China.\u201d\nThe exhibits from other countries were generally better curated and of higher quality, probably because of their limited number. They added variety and a broader international view to a festival that was overwhelmingly Chinese-themed. \nJonas Merian, a Swiss photographer, documented Bangladeshi life, while Franck Vogel of France showed striking black-and-white portraits of albino people in Tanzania. Moises Saman, a photojournalist whose work frequently appears in The New York Times, covered the consequences of the 2009 drought in Iraq.\nThe sizable Taiwan section was refreshingly quirky. There were several talented photographers who had turned Asian landscapes into almost abstract creations. \nThe mainland Chinese contingent was huge, with tens of thousands of photos. Editing that down to something more selective would have been nearly impossible and besides the point, anyway. \nPIP seemed to take a \u201ccome one, come all\u201d approach to domestic work and included students and others who might not be able to get their work in a museum or a big-city gallery. \nThe majority of the Chinese works was done in a documentary or journalistic style, like \u201cThirty Years of Chinese Life\u201d by Wang Fuchun, who is originally from Harbin, in China\u2019s far northeast. \nSome images were noteworthy because of rarity of their subject matters, like images of Siberian tigers by Viman Vivien Chong, a Hong Kong environmentalist. \nTucked away in a group show were Pu Yan\u2019s portraits of ethnic minorities living on the border of Yunnan Province and Myanmar. He sat patiently at a small table and explained how he had used a large-format film camera to create panoramic black-and-white images that had a lovely, misty quality.\nIt was his first year showing at PIP, and he said the highlight was being able to reach viewers from outside China. \u201cA Frenchman came and said he liked my work,\u201d Mr. Pu said. \u201cMaybe, someday, I\u2019ll be invited to France.\u201d \nNot all the works were documentary. There were more innovative pieces at a former cotton factory complex. One of the best Chinese shows was curated by Mo Yi, an artist originally from Tibet. He chose works mostly by women, including images of plastic dolls; a noisy video showing life inside a factory; and pictures of broken pieces of furniture, which fit in well with the crumbling walls of the venue. Eerie images, shot with a red filter, were suspended in pools of murky water. Perhaps the thinking was that, if you\u2019re going to show in a venue that\u2019s dripping wet, you might as well go all the way. \nSince PIP is a state-financed event, there were few overt political statements. While there was no overriding creative or curatorial theme, the festival did have \u201cconfidence and strength\u201d as a slogan. That theme was supported by the presence of uniformed military guards and a rousing anthem that played from a loudspeaker in the main exhibition area. The temples, in particular, had more patriotic works: glossy, color photos portraying scenes from the Beijing Olympics, the Shanghai World Expo, and the sorts of smiling airline attendants and quaint village folk found on tourist brochures. \nAside from a few corporate sponsors like Epson (which also offered printers for sale at the festival) and Audi (whose exhibited artwork clearly featured Audi products), the Pingyao event was distinctly noncommercial. In fact, with its dirt floors dotted with cigarette butts, it was downright grubby, and a world away from the auctions, galleries and museums of Shanghai, Beijing or Hong Kong. There wasn\u2019t a Champagne flute or cocktail dress in sight. \nStill, there was a party atmosphere on the night of the gala presentation as crowds rushed to the South Gate of Pingyao to watch endless rounds of fireworks go off just outside the ancient barricades.",

    "text": "As China\u2019s Wages Rise, Export Prices Could Follow\n2010-06-08T01:33:15.000Z\nSHANGHAI \u0097 The cost of doing business in China is going up. \nCoastal factories are increasing hourly payments to workers. Local governments are raising minimum wage standards. And if China allows its currency, the renminbi, to appreciate against the United States dollar later this year, as many economists are predicting, the relative cost of manufacturing in China will almost certainly rise. \nThe salaries of factory workers in China are still low compared to those in the United States and Europe: the hourly wage in southern China is only about 75 cents an hour. But economists say wage increases here will eventually ripple through the global economy, driving up the prices of goods as diverse as T-shirts, sneakers, computer servers and smartphones.\n \u201cFor a long time, China has been the anchor of global disinflation,\u201d said Dong Tao, an economist at Credit Suisse, referring to how the two-decade-long shift to manufacturing in China helped many global companies lower costs and prices. \u201cBut this may be the beginning of the end of an era.\u201d \nThe shift was illustrated Sunday, when Foxconn Technology, one of the world\u2019s largest contract electronics manufacturers and the maker of well-known products that include Apple iPhones and Dell computer parts, said that it was planning to double the salaries of many of its 800,000 workers in China, beginning in October. The new monthly average would be 2,000 renminbi \u0097 about $300, at current exchange rates. \nThe announcement follows a spate of suicides at two Foxconn campuses in southern China and criticism of the company\u2019s labor practices. \nFoxconn, based in Taiwan and employing more than 800,000 workers in China, said the salary increases were meant to improve the lives of its workers. \nLast week the Japanese automaker Honda said it had agreed to give about 1,900 workers at one of its plants in southern China raises of 24 to 32 percent, in hopes of ending a two-week strike, according to people briefed on the agreement. The new monthly average would be about $300, not counting overtime. \nAnd last Thursday, Beijing announced that it would raise the city\u2019s minimum monthly wage by 20 percent, to 960 renminbi, or about $140. Many other cities are expected to follow suit.\nAnalysts say the changes result from the growing clout of workers in China\u2019s economy, and are also a response to the soaring food and housing prices that have eroded the spending power of workers from rural provinces. These workers, without factoring in the recent wage increases by some employers, typically earn $200 a month, working six or seven days a week.\nBut there are other reasons. Analysts say Beijing is supporting wage increases as a way to stimulate domestic consumption and make the country less dependent on low-priced exports. The government hopes the move will force some export-oriented companies to invest in more innovative or higher-value goods. \nBut Chinese policy makers also favor higher wages because they could help ease a widening income gap between the rich and the poor. \nBig manufacturers are moving to raise salaries because they are desperate to attract new workers at a time when many coastal factory cities are struggling with labor shortages. \nA Foxconn executive said last week that the turnover rate at its two Shenzhen campuses \u0097 which employ over 400,000 people \u0097 was about 5 percent a month, meaning that as many as 20,000 workers were leaving every month and needed to be replaced. \nMarshall W. Meyer, a China specialist at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, says that demographic changes in China are reducing the supply of young workers entering the labor force and that this is behind some of the wage pressure. \n\u201cDemography will do what the Strategic and Economic Dialogue hasn\u2019t: raise the cost of Chinese goods,\u201d he said, referring to United States-China talks on Chinese currency reform and other economic issues. \u201cThere is no way out.\u201d \nEconomists say many of the same forces that were at work in 2007 and 2008, when China\u2019s economy was overheating, have returned and even intensified this year. \nLocal governments have stepped up enforcement of labor and environmental regulations, driving up production costs. \nAnd perhaps most troubling for companies here is the prospect of an appreciating Chinese currency, which would make their exports more expensive overseas. \nBeijing has long promised to allow its currency to fluctuate more freely. But when the global financial crisis shuttered many Chinese factories, the government effectively repegged the renminbi to the dollar to protect exporters. \nPietra Rivoli, a professor of international business at Georgetown University and the author of \u201cThe Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy,\u201d says the effects of rising labor costs will vary by industry, perhaps with lower-valued goods like garments being forced to move to western China or even to Vietnam and Bangladesh.\nBut she says high-end electronics like smartphones are likely to remain, because they command high profit margins and because China has built a sophisticated infrastructure and quality-control system.\n\u201cLabor is such a small piece of the pie for them,\u201d Professor Rivoli says of the electronics brands. \u201cThe money\u2019s all in the design, the marketing and the complicated distribution system, including retail outlets. Like with Apple, they have those rents in the shopping malls, fancy stores and all those hip people working there. That costs a lot.\u201d\nStill, salary increases are expected to affect many stages of the supply chain and force some companies to raise prices. For many exporters who simply produce on contract for global brands, profit margins are already razor-thin, and raising prices could hurt business.\n \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to find a way to pass this on to the end user,\u201d says Mr. Tao at Credit Suisse. \nEconomists say a necessary restructuring is under way, one that should allow the nation\u2019s huge \u201cfloating population\u201d of migrant workers to better share in the benefits of growth and stimulate domestic consumption. \nUnited States and European Union officials have been pressing China to help improve the global economy by consuming more and reducing the country\u2019s huge trade surpluses. \nRising labor costs here are not the end of cheap production in China, analysts say, but they are likely to help change the country\u2019s manufacturing mix. \n\u201cChina isn\u2019t going to lose its manufacturing base because it\u2019s got a huge domestic market,\u201d said Mary Gallagher, director of the Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Michigan. \u201cBut it will move them toward higher-end goods. And that matches the Chinese government\u2019s ambition. They don\u2019t just want to be the workshop of the world. They want to produce high-tech goods.\u201d ",

    "text": "Obama Takes Asia by Sea\n2010-11-12T02:51:49.000Z\nStockbridge, Mass. \nPRESIDENT OBAMA has insisted that his 10-day Asian journey is all about jobs: \u201cThe primary purpose is to ... open up markets so that we can sell in Asia, in some of the fastest-growing markets in the world, and we can create jobs here in the United States of America.\u201d But this recasting of the agenda, a late reaction to the midterm election, obscured the vital geopolitical importance of the trip.\n In fact, the president has been confronting a new strategic map that lies beyond our messy and diversionary land wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In geographical terms, two of the countries on the itinerary, India and Indonesia, are in the same increasingly pivotal region: the southern coastal areas, or \u201crimland\u201d of Eurasia, which is emerging as the world\u2019s hydrocarbon interstate, uniting energy-rich Arabia and Iran with the growing economies of the Pacific. \nGone today are the artificial divisions of cold-war-era studies: now the \u201cMiddle East,\u201d \u201cSouth Asia,\u201d \u201cSoutheast Asia\u201d and \u201cEast Asia\u201d are part of a single organic continuum. In geopolitical terms, the president\u2019s visits in all four countries are about one challenge: the rise of China on land and sea.\nIndia is increasingly feeling hemmed in by China\u2019s military might. It lies within the arc of operations of Chinese fighter jets based in Tibet. China is building or developing large ports in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Burma, and providing all these Indian Ocean countries with significant military and economic aid. \nAlthough India and China fought a border war in the early 1960s, they have never really been rivals, separated as they are by the Himalayas. But the shrinkage of distance thanks to globalism and advances of military technology has spawned a rivalry that is defining the new Eurasia. \nIndeed, it is India\u2019s emergence as a great Eurasian power that constitutes the best piece of news for American strategists since the end of the cold war. Merely by rising without any formal alliance with Washington, democratic India balances statist China. Even closer links between the United States and India would be better \u0097 and no doubt factored into Mr. Obama\u2019s talk of backing India for a seat on the United Nations Security Council \u0097 but are made complex by our chaotic land wars. \nWhile President Obama would like to withdraw from Afghanistan, Indian leaders remain afraid he will do precisely that. To Indians, Afghanistan is not a distant Central Asian country: it is historically part of the subcontinent. Empires as distant as the Harappans in the fourth millennium B.C. and as recent as the Mughals in the early modern era made Afghanistan, Pakistan and northern India part of the same polity. Indian elites carry this history in their bones.\n India wants a relatively benign and non-fundamentalist Afghanistan as a way of limiting Pakistan\u2019s influence in the region. (That\u2019s why India supported the Soviet-puppet Afghan leaders in the 1980s against the C.I.A.-backed mujahedeen.) \nWere the United States to withdraw precipitously, India would understandably look to Iran, Russia and perhaps China as allies in a tacit effort to contain Pakistan. Thus we could lose the prospect of a de facto pro-American India to balance the military and economic rise of China. \n President Obama must weigh this fact against the knowledge that every year the war in Afghanistan costs our military the equivalent of building several aircraft-carrier strike groups that could be used to increase our presence and to contain the expansion of the Chinese Navy in the Western Pacific, something that would assuage the concerns of our allies there. Of course, the president would rather use the savings to pay down the deficit; nonetheless, the Navy and the influence in Eurasia that it can provide have clearly been the loser in these land wars. \nWith Indonesia, Mr. Obama faces a similarly tricky challenge. Well over 200 million of Indonesia\u2019s 240 million inhabitants are Muslims. Because the bearers of Islam there were sea-borne merchants, and thus heralds of a cosmopolitan interpretation of the faith that fit well with indigenous Javanese culture, Islam in Indonesia (and throughout the South Seas) has lacked the austere ideological edge found in the Middle East. \nToday, however, the advent of global communications, along with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the dispatch of Wahhabi clerics from the Persian Gulf to the Far East, has radicalized many Indonesians. This puts the nation\u2019s leaders in a bind: on the one hand, they want a robust American naval presence to counterbalance China, which is Indonesia\u2019s largest trading partner; on the other, they fear angering the wider Islamic world if they make closer ties to Washington too public. \n Indonesia, whose archipelago is as vast as the continental United States is wide, has only two submarines; China has dozens. While China\u2019s materialistic culture may soften the influence of political Islam in Southeast Asia, China also plays on the tension between the West and global Islam in order to limit American influence there. That is why President Obama\u2019s mission to rebrand America in the eyes of Muslims carries benefits that go far beyond Indonesia and the Middle East.\nIndonesia\u2019s Muslim democracy, a dozen years after the fall of Suharto, boasts vigor and moderation. And combined with Indonesia\u2019s immense population, it augurs the emergence of a sort of \u201csecond India\u201d in the Eurasian rimland, strategically located on the Strait of Malacca, the shipping superhighway between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Since the art of preparing for a multipolar world in military as well as economic terms is to gain the support of like-minded others, the Obama administration needs to use the energy generated by the president\u2019s visit in order to adopt Indonesia as its new favorite country, just as India was adopted by the George W. Bush administration to substantial effect.\n As for Japan and South Korea, while China remains their biggest trading partner, both fear Beijing\u2019s growing navy and the \u201csoft power\u201d it projects in the Pacific. This is largely why these countries have let Washington maintain a military presence on their soil and the United States has pushed them to expand their own forces. \nYet the Japanese and South Korean publics are increasingly restive about the American military bases. Thus our strategic future in the region is not these huge cold-war-type bases with their fast-food restaurants and shopping malls; they inevitably become political millstones. Rather, we need discreet operating locations, under local sovereignty, that the Pentagon helps to maintain. It\u2019s a strategy that will work only if such operations don\u2019t raise the ire of the local populations and press, meaning that our public diplomacy will have to be effective and unceasing. \nIndeed, Washington has been making great strides on the public-diplomacy front: a principal benefit of having special envoys to Israel and the Palestinian territories and to Afghanistan and Pakistan is that it has freed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to make more high-profile trips to East and South Asia, where she has been, in effect, competing all the while with China on the public stage. The president\u2019s trip is one culmination of this effort.\nTHE 20th century saw great, land-centric Army deployments to Europe. George W. Bush unwittingly continued this tendency with great, land-centric deployments to the Middle East, where we became ensnared in intra-Islamic conflict. As President Obama develops his grand strategy for Eurasia, the great step forward would be creating a smaller footprint on land and a bigger one at sea. Navies are very conducive to projecting soft power: they make port visits and guard the global commons, whereas armies invade. \n Easing India\u2019s fears about Chinese-built ports in the Indian Ocean as well as Indonesia and its neighbors\u2019 worries about Chinese designs in the South China Sea and Japan and South Korea\u2019s about China\u2019s goal of dominating the islands of the Western Pacific is in each case a matter of warships, not ground troops.\n As the Yale geostrategist Nicholas J. Spykman wrote in 1942, because America had no rivals in the Western Hemisphere, it had the \u201cpower to spare for activities outside the New World,\u201d like determining the balance of power in the Eastern Hemisphere. And in Eurasia, Spykman went on, the maritime rimland is pivotal, because it is essential to the supercontinent\u2019s contact with the outside world. Let\u2019s hope that President Obama\u2019s visits to key states of coastal Asia will prove Spykman\u2019s theory correct.",

    "text": "New York Rebounds From Slump, Unevenly\n2010-08-30T16:05:26.000Z\nBy most standard measures of economic health, New York City\u2019s recovery from the financial crisis and the recession it started is well under way. \n The typical New Yorker is less likely to be unemployed or facing foreclosure or bankruptcy than the average American. Homes in the metropolitan area have held their value better than in most other big cities as more people are moving to the region than deserting it. Tourists continue to flock to the city, filling hotel rooms at the highest rate in the country, and at rising prices. \n Wall Street \u0097 still the engine that powers the city \u0097 roared back faster than expected, eliminated far fewer jobs than had been forecast, resumed paying out big bonuses and has begun to hire again. Despite a faltering stock market and recent signals that the national economy is losing steam, economists expect New York to remain on the rebound.\n\u201cWe have been feeling on more solid footing the last six months,\u201d said Marcia Van Wagner, the city\u2019s assistant comptroller for budget. \u201cIf there\u2019s no major shock, I think we\u2019re going to have a slow, relatively steady recovery.\u201d\nThere were some major shocks two years ago, most notably the collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank, which heralded the end of the boom years. Lehman\u2019s failure, in September 2008, caused a panic in financial markets that spurred predictions of another Great Depression.\nBut in the city, far fewer jobs were lost than had been predicted and there has been job growth for the last six months. In July, the number of jobs in the city was down 108,000, or less than 3 percent, from July 2008. Over the same 24 months, the nation lost 6.7 million jobs, or more than 4.5 percent. The city\u2019s unemployment rate slipped last month to 9.4 percent, slightly below the national rate.\n Still, experts on the city\u2019s economy said the effects of the recession were spread unevenly across the local landscape, leaving many people in dire financial condition. David R. Jones, the chief executive of the Community Service Society of New York, an antipoverty group, said that the farther away from Midtown one wandered, the more ravaged the city appeared.\n \u201cWhile we\u2019re seeing in Manhattan that things are going relatively well and there\u2019s been a sharp rebound, in some neighborhoods of New York things are not going well,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \n Away from the office towers and rooftop cocktail lounges, long-term unemployment is a persistent problem, and young job seekers are losing hope, Mr. Jones said. A survey in late July of city residents who meet or barely exceed the definition of poor found that only about one-fifth of them thought the city\u2019s economy was improving, he said.\n The city\u2019s construction industry, which practically ground to a halt in 2009, is still mired in a slump. The total value of building projects begun in the second quarter was less than half the level of two years earlier. \n And so, while economists agree that the recession is over in the city and that it did not last as long or exact as harsh a toll as on the rest of the country, the key determinant of people\u2019s current well-being appears to be whether they came out of the recession with a job.\n Those who remained employed, especially if they had professional or managerial positions, were fortunate. James A. Parrott, chief economist of the Fiscal Policy Institute, found that in the city, the income data masked a deep divide: the pay of managers rose at a healthy clip through the recession while lower-level workers took significant cuts in pay.\nAccording to Mr. Parrott\u2019s analysis of local wage data, the median pay of managerial workers in the city was $990 a week in the first four months of this year, up 11 percent in three years. But the median weekly pay for nonmanagers was $472, or 10.4 percent less than they earned in the first four months of 2007. \nThe growing gap \u201cindicates a worrisome weakening in the ability of less-skilled New York workers to maintain their wage-earning power,\u201d Mr. Parrott said. \n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t bode well for the recovery in consumer spending in New York\u2019s neighborhoods,\u201d he continued.\nPersonal incomes dropped more in New York than in the rest of the country last year, largely because of the smaller bonuses that were paid out in early 2009 for the dismal performance in 2008. But 2009 was very profitable for some of the banks that survived, like Goldman Sachs, and the corresponding bonuses have helped buoy the city this year, economists said.\n\u201cEven though the recession was milder in terms of the number of jobs lost, the income loss was much greater,\u201d said Marisa Di Natale, an economist with Moody\u2019s Economy.com.\n The quick bounce back for the city\u2019s best-paid workers has helped fuel a pickup in business at exclusive bo\u00eetes and expensive hotels, consultants and business operators said. On Friday, Tiffany & Company said sales at its flagship jewelry store on Fifth Avenue rose 16 percent in the first half of the year.\n But many businesses, particularly those that cater to the city\u2019s workers rather than executives or tourists, are struggling to stay afloat, they said.\n\u201cThe 25 most-coveted restaurants in New York are doing an incredible amount of business,\u201d serving 10 percent to 15 percent more diners than they did a year ago, said Steven Kamali, who brokers sales of restaurants and bars and advises hotel owners on food service. \u201cOn the other side of the argument, what we\u2019re finding is the local neighborhood restaurants are taking the brunt of the pain.\u201d\nThe steady stream of visitors has kept the city\u2019s hotels nearly full, though room rates remain well below the levels they reached before the recession. \n \u201cThings seem to be getting better, almost inching back to late-2007 levels,\u201d said Andr\u00e9 Balazs, who operates boutique hotels including the Standard and the Mercer.\n But, Mr. Balazs said, even his wealthiest clients had not kicked a habit from the recession of haggling over their bills. \u201cPeople who would fly a private plane to a destination suddenly feel the need to negotiate the price of a suite,\u201d he said.\nOn the streets of some neighborhoods, working-class residents like Selina Sharmin are still dreading the recession\u2019s aftermath. \n Ms. Sharmin, 37, has worked in public libraries in Queens since she immigrated from her native Bangladesh 10 years ago. Just six months after she was promoted to a full-fledged librarian\u2019s position, she received notice that she and 45 other employees of the borough\u2019s public library system would be laid off on Thursday because of budget cuts.\n\u201cThis is my dream job, I can tell you,\u201d said Ms. Sharmin, who lives in Jamaica with her husband and two young children. \u201cNow my future is dark and unknown.\u201d\nIf she is laid off as scheduled, she said, she doubted that she would be able to afford the family health insurance her job provided. She said continuing that coverage would cost at least $700 a month. But she would receive just $405 a week in unemployment benefits, barely enough to cover her $1,200 monthly house payment, she said.\n\u201cNow I really don\u2019t know what I should do and what I am going to do,\u201d said Ms. Sharmin, whose husband has not been able to find work since he was laid off from a job in a gift shop. \u201cWho\u2019s going to hire me?\u201d\nProposals to lay off more employees of city and state agencies like the Metropolitan Transportation Authority could continue to temper a local recovery, economists said. A reluctance to hire full-time employees in some struggling industries like publishing is another drag on the city\u2019s economy, they said.\nAlexandra Ben Othman, 29, of Sunnyside, Queens, can tell that tale in the first person.\n Through most of last year, Ms. Ben Othman could not find any work after she was laid off by a publishing company. For the last six months, she has worked steadily as a proofreader, but the jobs have been temporary, leaving her to fear that the next paycheck could be the last. She receives no benefits, so she has gone without health insurance for almost a year.\n \u201cFor a while I was looking for full-time,\u201d Ms. Ben Othman said, describing her job search. \u201cThen at one point I needed to take whatever I could get.\u201d Her current assignment with an educational publisher is \u201cstill a little bit shaky but definitely a lot more secure than most other temporary assignments.\u201d\n Her husband, Mohamed Ben Othman, a Tunisian immigrant who drives a taxi on weekends, is looking for work as a plumber\u2019s apprentice. She said she had considered taking classes toward a graduate degree in marketing or Islamic art history. A more remote possibility, she added, would be to move to Tunisia to teach English.\n In the meantime, Ms. Ben Othman said, she is taking lunch to work, shopping at Costco and Target and frequenting her local movie theater on Tuesdays when tickets are just $5. \u201cThese days,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m being very frugal.\u201d ",

    "text": "Can Microlending Save Haiti?\n2010-11-13T16:57:59.000Z\n L\u00e9og\u00e2ne, Haiti\nVENANTE LINO, a small-business owner who lost nearly everything in the devastating earthquake in January, stood in line here along with dozens of other impeccably dressed women, all waiting to pay the latest monthly installment on the emergency loans they received to rebuild their businesses.\nMrs. Lino approached a folding table in the courtyard of one of the few remaining buildings in this town, located near the quake\u2019s epicenter. She emptied her pockets of cash and gave all $40 to the loan officer. \n\u201cEvery day, I wake up and ask God to make this better. Many days, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s listening,\u201d says Mrs. Lino, a 63-year-old grandmother who lives under a tarp in her backyard with three grown children and four grandchildren, surviving on the meager income from a small food and cooking-oil business she reopened this summer with loan money. \u201cWithout this help, I don\u2019t know where my family would be.\u201d \n Here in this once-bustling coastal town about 20 miles west of Port-au-Prince, more than 30,000 people \u0097 a third of the population \u0097 died as a result of the quake. Throughout Haiti, the toll may be as high as 250,000, and the economic effects have been staggering. The country\u2019s economy is expected to contract by as much as 9 percent this year, and more than a million residents live in tent cities. And an outbreak of cholera, as well as a hurricane early this month, have left the nation even more vulnerable.\n Especially hard hit are the tens of thousands of small-business owners, known as ti machann, who sell everything from heating oil to school uniforms from their homes and are often the sole breadwinners for their families. Because Haiti\u2019s credit markets remain frozen, people like Mrs. Lino would have had almost no chance to rebuild if it weren\u2019t for microbanks like Fonkoze, Haiti\u2019s largest, which gave loans to the women in L\u00e9og\u00e2ne.\nIn the best circumstances, sustaining a \u201cbank to the poor\u201d is no easy feat, but in Haiti after the earthquake, the challenge has been extraordinary. Even before the quake, 80 percent of the population lived on less than $2 a day. Today, while some 50 nations and organizations have pledged a total of $8.75 billion for reconstruction, less than 15 percent of the total promised for 2010-11 has arrived. (The United States has not yet paid all the $1.2 billion in reconstruction funds it pledged.)\nHaitian microbanks provide a crucial lifeline to the poor, but their financial situations are sometimes nearly as precarious as those of their clients. Moreover, the banks are operating in a country that lacks many of the basic building blocks for businesses \u0097 reliable transportation, communication and supply networks \u0097 thus making the challenges all the more complex. \nTheir importance to hundreds of thousands of Haitian borrowers and savers gives these little institutions an outsize importance, making them \u201csimply too big to fail,\u201d said Greta Greathouse, a consultant with the United States Agency for International Development\u2019s microsavings and lending program in Haiti. \n\u201cYou are dealing with a very vulnerable and fragile population,\u201d she said. The banks \u201cneed to get stronger on a permanent basis so they can offset the operational risks that come with Haiti because of the earthquake and the inherent risks that are unfortunately a way of life for the country and its people.\u201d\nMICROCREDIT banks, or microbanks, were pioneered by Muhammad Yunus, the founder of the Grameen Bank, which started 40 years ago by giving loans of a few dollars each to poor entrepreneurs in Bangladesh. In 2006, Mr. Yunus received the Nobel Peace Prize for this work.\nIn most cases today, microcredit clients start off with loans of as little as $25 to start a small business. The loans are often given to women who tend to spend their earnings directly on their families and communities. Many borrow in groups of five or more, and all members of the group work together and are responsible for repayment. \nSome microlenders provide only loans, while others also offer education and health services. Partly because costs are so high, effective interest rates are often significantly steeper than those at traditional banks. In Haiti, rates range from 30 percent to 55 percent a year.\n\u201cHaiti is one of the most complicated environments for anyone to do business, let alone a small lender with an extremely poor clientele,\u201d said Alex Counts, president of the Grameen Foundation, a nonprofit in Washington that fosters microlending. \u201cAppropriate levels of interest are important, but it\u2019s also essential these organizations continue to do the important work they do.\u201d \nOne of the largest of Haiti\u2019s microcredit groups, Finca Haiti, wrote off almost a third of its portfolio after many clients died in the earthquake or lost their homes and businesses. A staggering 53 percent of its borrowers were late on their payments. After losses of its own, ACME, another Haitian microbank, raised additional capital this summer. \nFonkoze, Creole for \u201cshoulder to shoulder,\u201d was started by the Rev. Joseph Philippe, a Haitian priest, in the mid-1990s. It has 45,000 clients and 43 branches across the country, but it lost $2 million in the three years before the earthquake. In 2008, after losses from a particularly bad hurricane season, the organization considered closing its for-profit bank and incorporating that division\u2019s 24 branches.\nOver all, the share of microcredit clients in Haiti who have defaulted or are at risk of doing so has risen to 18 percent, more than double the rate of a year ago. The international standard is 2 to 3 percent. Several of the Haitian microbanks, particularly some very small ones, could close or reduce their operations if their portfolios don\u2019t improve, according to microbanking experts in Haiti and elsewhere. It\u2019s likely that some will have to consolidate in order to survive.\nMicrobanks in other countries are increasingly aiming to become self-sustaining so they don\u2019t need to continually raise funds to pay operational expenses. Some have transformed themselves from nonprofit into for-profit banks, raising questions of whether altruism and capitalism can co-exist. India\u2019s largest microlender, SKS Microfinance, went public this summer, raising $358 million, and other banks may do the same.\n While most microbanks in Haiti remain nonprofits, and have less financial transparency, Fonkoze started a for-profit bank (in addition to its nonprofit arm) in 2004 and reports both divisions\u2019 earnings. It operated at a loss for three years but has stabilized after $15 million in donations this year.\nHaiti has had natural disasters before, of course. But the earthquake\u2019s impact on the nation\u2019s banks was staggeringly high, in no small part because of the damage in Port-au-Prince, the capital, which accounts for 60 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. The banking sector, already fragile, was crippled. Out of 1,800 microbank employees in the affected region, 600 lost their homes. A quarter of the $38 million in outstanding microcredit loans in the region could end up defaulting, according to an analysis by Ms. Greathouse. \nDespite the risks and financial costs, several Haitian microbanks are expanding, saying their loans are one of the only paths to self-sufficiency for the growing number of poor people in Port-au-Prince and the countryside. \nFor example, after losing a third of its 12,000 clients after the earthquake, Finca added back 1,000 clients this summer with the help of a grant from the Citibank Foundation. It\u2019s a risky move: the percentage of Finca Haiti clients who are more than 30 days behind on their payments, a standard known as portfolio at risk, remains at 35 percent. \nIn July, after its director was ambushed in an attempted robbery, the bank moved its headquarters from the capital to a nearby coastal city, Saint-Marc, according to Rupert Scofield, the president of Finca, which is based in Washington and operates in 21 countries. \nWhen it comes to doing business, \u201cHaiti is probably the hardest place in the world right now outside maybe Afghanistan,\u201d Mr. Scofield says. \u201cIt always seems just as things get stabilized, something else happens to pull the country back.\u201d\n Anne Hastings, Fonkoze\u2019s co-chief executive, has become something of an international aid celebrity: she was a high-profile attendee of the Clinton Global Initiative conference this fall in New York. (The bank\u2019s profile rose significantly in the days after the earthquake, when it was one of the only banks operating outside Port-au-Prince, and Ms. Hastings secured American military assistance to airlift $2 million in cash to desperate clients.)\nSoon after the quake, Fonkoze wrote off 10,000 loans \u0097 almost a quarter of its total number \u0097 with funds from the Red Cross and others. The bank then gave each client a new loan and a one-time cash payment of $125, at a total cost of $8.5 million. \nIn recent months, the bank has broadened its health program and aggressively stepped up its operations, particularly in rural areas where poverty rates are highest and seem to be growing. \nThe bank has enlarged a loan program, called Ti Kredi, or Little Credit, to reach poor families that are not ready for larger loans. Ti Kredi offers loans of just $25, shorter repayment periods, additional support from loan officers, and literacy and health classes. \nIn another program, clients are offered goats or chickens so they can sell milk or eggs, as well as a weekly stipend of $7 to help with expenses, and to ensure that they don\u2019t need to kill the animals because they are hungry. \nSINCE the summer, Fonkoze loan officers have canvassed the lush, mountainous region on motorcycles, in pickup trucks or on foot to sign up as many as 3,000 new clients and to meet with existing ones to monitor their progress and to collect loan payments.\nOne recent rainy day, Steve Werlin rode for more than an hour on the back of a pickup truck outside Mirebalais, a small, central plateau town two hours north of Port-au-Prince. Mr. Werlin, a regional Fonkoze director, was on his way to meet Marie Ange Joute, a 30-year-old mother of two. Ms. Joute joined Fonkoze in September and lives with her children, mother, sister and niece (who was sick with a severe eye infection) in a small mud house with a tin roof on a 20-by-20-foot parcel of land. The house, which Ms. Joute inherited from her father, is her only asset, and she said the family had sometimes gone without food and medical care over the last year.\nShe has no business background but recently received two chickens and a goat from the bank and started selling eggs and heating oil from her house. To save enough money to expand her inventory, she joined a savings club with 10 local Fonkoze clients. Each woman saves a third of her weekly stipend so that once every 10 weeks, they get a lump-sum payment of $20 for larger purchases. \nClients are required to do many things on their own, and face penalties if they cannot meet certain goals. On the day of the visit, Ms. Joute had yet to build a shed for her goat, which could become sick in the rain. So she was told she wouldn\u2019t get her stipend the next week unless the shed was built. (Fonkoze gave her materials and training to build the shed, and she complied.) \n\u201cI want to make my own money and care for my family,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to provide for us if something goes bad. I know how to work.\u201d \nAFTER the upcoming presidential elections, Haiti\u2019s government is expected to issue new banking regulations, including rules for microlenders. They aren\u2019t regulated now, though they have appealed for years to the government for rules that could bring more certainty to the industry. If a microbank went out of business, for example, it is not clear what would happen to the many clients who deposit their savings in the bank.\nFonkoze has 200,000 savings accounts, totaling $14 million. Currently, it uses those funds to make new loans, and it says that all of its accounts are secure. Because it was able to write off risky loans early this year, according to James Kurz, a senior Fonkoze financial adviser, its portfolio at risk has fallen to 5 percent in recent months.\nIf Haiti\u2019s economy doesn\u2019t improve and the country cannot stem various other problems, even some people who have managed to eke out a living with the help of microcredit could face more difficulty. \nSainte Anne Louis sells sodas, canned goods, clothing and homemade peanut butter outside her home in Mirebalais, yards away from a construction site for a new rural teaching hospital. She says her sales have fallen by nearly half this year, in part because it has been hard to secure enough inventory. \nMrs. Louis, 54, supports her entire family, including her husband, two daughters and their families. She worries about what will happen if things don\u2019t improve soon. \u201cWe are grateful for what we have today,\u201d she says, \u201cbut we pray tomorrow will be better.\u201d ",

    "text": "Artists in Residence\n2010-09-22T18:08:15.000Z\n Rome has nothing on Detroit. The industrial ruins in this American city are at least as spectacular, and largely unmatched in scale anywhere in the United States. They are also fertile ground for a growing number of artists like Scott Hocking, who find inspiration in the tatters. To make his large-format photographs, Hocking has built anomalous sculptures in two ghostly auto plants, Fisher Body and Packard, both designed by Detroit\u2019s leading industrial architect, Albert Kahn. \nLast winter Hocking stole onto the Packard\u2019s grounds, now so devastated they suggest the aftermath of an earthquake, and installed junked TVs atop fluted columns that had supported the roof of one building. Standing on hilly terrain that was once the level top floor, we could see the unblemished 1963 Mies van der Rohe apartment towers in Lafayette Park across town. The juxtaposition of a living civilization against its vast remains was so disquieting I couldn\u2019t speak.\nToday Detroit, home of the American automobile industry and a once-mighty symbol of enterprise and ingenuity, is a city of haunting contradictions. Spread over roughly 140 square miles, it has a business district that resembles a ghost town: it is not unusual to spot wild dogs on downtown streets, pheasants in backyards or tumbleweeds rolling down sidewalks. There are an estimated 33,000 empty houses and 91,000 vacant lots, many of which sit cheek by jowl with pristine Art Deco skyscrapers, glorious estates and freshly painted single-family homes.\nAll of it packs a visual wallop, which is one reason this failed metropolis has become such a magnet for contemporary artists, who include important figures like Matthew Barney and the Detroit-born Mike Kelley as well as rising stars like Cyprien Gaillard and Jordan Wolfson.\nFor his show at the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit (Mocad), Kelley will drive a mobile re-creation of his childhood home from the museum through downtown slums to his family\u2019s western suburb, stopping at the Henry Ford museum; it will then be parked permanently as a community center at Mocad, an avant-garde showcase at a former car dealership. \u201cMy hope is that along this route some kind of \u2018social services\u2019 are performed using the structure,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething along the lines of a bloodmobile or Meals on Wheels.\u201d Kelley, now based in L.A., is joining a community that is reshaping the city as no outsider could. Where visitors see a corpse, these activists see a phoenix; the derelict homes that are shorthand for the faltering economy present opportunities. \u201cThere\u2019s something about the desolation that makes it easier to do something different,\u201d said Levon Millross, a performance artist and member of the cultural underground who wears a shoulder-pad assemblage he made from Styrofoam, electronic hardware, keys and gooseneck tubing. \u201cAnd it\u2019s empowering.\u201d\nAttracted by cheap space and driven by a sense of civic responsibility, young artists are turning crumbling homes into art centers, converting factories into studio and exhibition spaces, and planting community gardens as artworks. As the 25-year-old Kate Daughdrill put it, for her generation Detroit is no city on the skids but \u201ca theater of engagement.\u201d \nOf course, artists in other depressed cities have rejuvenated decrepit neighborhoods before, only to be exiled by gentrification to even more unsavory locations, where the cycle repeats. But with crime rates soaring and some officials estimating unemployment to be as high as 50 percent, that\u2019s not likely to happen here anytime soon. Meanwhile, Detroiters might welcome more amenities like the Cass Caf\u00e9, a wallet-friendly hangout near the Wayne State University campus.\n\u201cI hope we\u2019re battling gentrification,\u201d said Daughdrill, co-founder of a monthly benefit dinner called Soup that supplies micro-grants for creative projects. When we spoke, Daughdrill was working on a project at the Russell Industrial Center, a complex of former auto-body factories that offers cut-rate space to a gallery called Cave, a glass-blowing factory, a pole-dancing exercise studio and a coppersmith, among others. \nKathy Leisen, 32, took over two empty plots in her North Corktown neighborhood, northwest of the city center, and created the Lot, an outdoor art space with site-specific projects. In Highland Park, an impoverished, predominantly black neighborhood, an art collective painted 16 derelict homes orange to make them visible from expressways to northern suburbs, where much of the city\u2019s white population first fled after the 1967 riots. \nThe impresario of such guerrilla art in Detroit is Tyree Guyton, who started painting polka dots and mystical circles on the vacant houses in the McDougall-Hunt area 25 years ago. He also filled the empty lots between the houses with stuffed animals, salvaged furniture and upright car hoods bearing the imprint of primitive masks. A trained artist with a metaphysical bent, the 54-year-old Guyton says he put \u201cthe face of God in the \u2019hood.\u201d Now an unofficial landmark maintained by his nonprofit Heidelberg Project, the original site draws 275,000 visitors a year. Next he plans to suspend vintage cars from the facade of Brewster-Douglas Projects, the abandoned housing complex where Diana Ross grew up. \u201cWhat\u2019s made me successful is my faith,\u201d Guyton said. \u201cI created an audience and tapped into something bigger than all of us.\u201d \nOn the border of Hamtramck, a largely Polish-Bangladeshi municipality, the artist Mitch Cope and the architect Gina Reichert have made real estate development a primary medium for their own socially conscious art. Working from a modest home in a former grocery store, they have bought or facilitated the sale of 10 neighborhood houses to other artists and curators from Detroit, Chicago and Europe. One was a $100 tear-down partly destroyed by two arson attempts. \nThe couple\u2019s most ambitious project is the Power House, which they conceived as a design lab for artists and architects. This summer, they organized groups from San Francisco and the Netherlands to prepare the house for solar power and rebuilt the interior, using Detroit\u2019s abundant scrap materials. \u201cThe house is meant to be a public space and an experiment in what can be done off the grid,\u201d Cope said. \u201cThere is too much opportunity here. You can be consumed by it. But it\u2019s a malleable city, and you can change and improve it.\u201d\nThough the city is broke and many of its art collectors stay cloistered in wealthy suburbs, there is some institutional support. Last year the Michigan-based Kresge Foundation created a program that awards $25,000 grants to artists who work in the Detroit area. And this year, the local McGregor Fund began supporting the four-year-old Mocad. Luis Croquer, its director, has attracted financing from private individuals and foundations, mounted an ambitious program of American and European art, and scheduled musical performances, readings and symposia that have made Mocad the community\u2019s social hub. \n\u201cWe\u2019re an audience builder, a think tank, a point of access to the world,\u201d said Croquer, who admits it\u2019s not easy to get people from the suburbs to go downtown. \u201cI think people are unprepared for the changes that are coming.\u201d\nOne person who is banking on it is the dealer George N\u2019Namdi. Last fall he opened an 8,000-square-foot space in the midtown Cultural District, where he shows international artists of color. \u201cThe energy is in the city,\u201d said N\u2019Namdi, whose gallery is one of the oldest in the country owned by an African-American. Many of his artists live and work nearby, in mixed-race neighborhoods like the Eastern Market area northeast of the city center, and in Corktown, home of the former Michigan Central Station, a 18-story Beaux-Arts relic that is Detroit\u2019s reigning symbol of decay. \nNearly all the other galleries are in the suburbs, anchored by the ultracool Susanne Hilberry Gallery. And more are starting to come. Monica Bowman, 33, opened the Butcher\u2019s Daughter in an office space in Ferndale a year ago. \u201cI saw people on the ground desperate to change things, and I saw I could make an impact,\u201d said Bowman, who hopes to connect the city\u2019s emerging art scene with deep-pocketed collectors nearby. \u201cIt sounds evangelical, but, well, you have to believe before you can do anything. The issue is how to get people with disposable income to spend it on art instead of cars.\u201d\nCars are partly what drew Matthew Barney to the city: one is the star of \u201cKHU,\u201d the second installment of his projected seven-part epic, to be presented next month as a five-hour journey on the Detroit River. The Motor City also resonates with Barney because of his obsession with Harry Houdini, who died here after a performance. \nThough many in the baby-boomer generation are skeptical that the young idealists can sustain even the most promising projects without developing a new class of collectors to support them, they have made a commitment to Detroit that seems unshakable. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard city to understand,\u201d said Julie Taubman, a founding member of Mocad who has taken thousands of photographs of the city. \u201cI think it\u2019s the most visually compelling place on the planet. If you have a sense of adventure and curiosity, there\u2019s no place like this.\u201d \nEssentials: Detroit\nHotels There is an Omni downtown (omnihotels.com), but Detroit lacks high-end hotels.

    "text": "D.I.Y. Foreign-Aid Revolution\n2010-10-20T12:54:36.000Z\nLike so many highly trained young women these days, Elizabeth Scharpf has choices. She could be working in a Manhattan office tower with her Harvard Business School classmates, soaring through the ranks as a banker or business executive and aspiring to become a senator or a C.E.O. someday.\nAfter all, there\u2019s no question that women around the world enjoy opportunities that simply didn\u2019t exist a few decades ago. Yet the women exerting the greatest pressure for change often aren\u2019t the presidents and tycoons but those toiling further down the pyramid, driven by a passion to create a better world. And in particular, a better world for women.\nThat\u2019s Scharpf\u2019s choice. Now 33, Scharpf was interning in the summer of 2005 for the World Bank in Mozambique, helping local entrepreneurs, when she encountered a business impediment that she had never heard of. It was unmentionable, and thus unmentioned. It was menstruation.\nA female boss griped to Scharpf about absenteeism caused by women reluctant to come to work during their menstrual periods. \u201cIt was because pads were too expensive,\u201d Scharpf recalls. \u201cI was trying to figure out why I had never heard of this before. This was causing productivity rates to go down.\u201d\nScharpf began asking around, and everybody told her \u2014 in whispers \u2014 that, yes, of course menstruation was keeping women and girls from jobs. Back at Harvard, where she was pursuing joint degrees at the business school and the John F. Kennedy School of Government, she began asking friends from Bangladesh, Nicaragua and other countries if they were aware of this problem. Of course, they said. \u201cThis spoke to me,\u201d Scharpf recalled. \u201cHasn\u2019t every girl or woman experienced the inconvenience, the disadvantage and the embarrassment in her life, when her period strikes at the \u2018wrong\u2019 time? I think half the world can relate to that. What really struck me was that this was a global issue that seemingly had significant costs. From back-of-the-envelope calculations, it had huge costs. And it could have a simple solution.\u201d She paused and smiled tightly. \u201cI was a little na\u00efve there.\u201d\nScharpf is a mild-mannered policy wonk, but the more she thought about it, the more indignant she became. Girls were missing school because they couldn\u2019t afford sanitary pads? Women couldn\u2019t go to work for lack of pads? And all this was taboo to discuss? Scharpf began to scheme.\nAnd so Scharpf joined a revolution, so far unnamed because it is just beginning. It\u2019s all about what might be called Do-It-Yourself Foreign Aid, because it starts with the proposition that it\u2019s not only presidents and United Nations officials who chip away at global challenges. Passionate individuals with great ideas can do the same, especially in the age of the Internet and social media.\nI became interested in such figures while writing a book with my wife, Sheryl WuDunn, about educating and empowering women as a solution to many of the world\u2019s problems. We ran into extraordinary men, like Muhammad Yunus of Grameen Bank, who pioneered microfinance in Bangladesh. Or Bill Drayton, an American who is a godfather of entrepreneurs working for social change and who now runs a group called Ashoka to support them. Or Greg Mortenson, whose struggles to build schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan are chronicled in \u201cThree Cups of Tea.\u201d But it struck us that women in particular were finding creative ways to help the world\u2019s most vulnerable people, many of them also women.\nAs a college sophomore, Jennifer Staple founded Unite for Sight, which has now provided eye care to more than one million people around the world. Kyle Zimmer, a corporate lawyer who tutored inner-city school children on the side, went on to create First Book, which over nearly 20 years has delivered more than 70 million books to book-deprived children in the United States and Canada. One of the world\u2019s largest grass-roots organizations is India\u2019s Self-Employed Women\u2019s Association, or SEWA. It was founded in 1972 by a lawyer named Ela Bhatt, who helped people living on the margins \u2014 textile workers and later peasants and small vendors, among others \u2014 by organizing them so that they could improve their health, start businesses and even bank among themselves.\nAre these young idealists unsophisticated about what it takes to change the world? Yes, often. At first, they don\u2019t always appreciate the importance of listening to local people and bringing them into the management of projects, and they usually overestimate the odds of success. They also sometimes think it will be romantic to tackle social problems, a view that may fade when they\u2019ve caught malaria.\nAfter college at Notre Dame and before grad school at Harvard, Scharpf worked for three years in global pharmeceuticals and biotech. As soon as she finished her graduate programs at Harvard, she began harnessing her contacts to design a company that would manufacture inexpensive sanitary pads for Africa and Asia, to be distributed by women themselves on a franchise system. Soon Scharpf was in Rwanda, where schoolgirls told her they routinely stayed home during their periods to avoid the risk of humiliation, with one explaining: \u201cWhat if I get called to go to the blackboard and I have a stain on the back of my skirt?\u201d Scharpf found that the cheapest pads commercially available cost $1.10 for a pack of 10. In rural villages, women and girls used rags or sometimes bark or mud instead.\nCommercial pads turned out to be expensive to manufacture largely because the raw materials were pricey, so Scharpf started from scratch. She recruited a team of like-minded wonks, and they consulted villagers, agriculture experts and professors of textile engineering. What is there that is really absorbent, widely available and cheap? The team came up with five finalists: cassava leaves, banana leaves, banana-tree trunk fibers, foam mattresses, textile scraps. \u201cWe brought a blender to Rwanda and started blending things, boiling leaves from potato and cassava, things like that,\u201d Scharpf said. \u201cWe would drop Coke on it to measure absorbency.\u201d That was when they had their eureka moment. \u201cWe saw, hey, those banana fibers really slurp up the Coke!\u201d\nScharpf accepted a $60,000 grant from Echoing Green, an organization that works like a venture-capital fund to finance people with great ideas. Later she won a social-entrepreneurship fellowship from Harvard Business School, and now her team has engineered a new sanitary pad that she hopes can transform life for women and girls in the developing world. It looks like a regular pad but is made chiefly out of banana-tree fibers, so it is sustainable and for the most part biodegradable. Best of all, it\u2019s cheap: a pack of 10 should retail for 75 cents or less.\nScharpf\u2019s organization, Sustainable Health Enterprises (or SHE), will begin manufacturing pads early next year in a tiny factory in Rwanda. It will be a pilot project, producing some 1,200 pads per hour, but once the kinks are worked out she hopes to have women in other countries franchise the system so that it spreads around the world. SHE has also taken on advocacy, calling on the Rwandan government to lift an 18 percent sales tax on feminine hygiene products so that they become more affordable. Awakened to the issue, the Rwandan Parliament recently appropriated $35,000 to pay for sanitary pads for impoverished girls who otherwise might miss school \u2014 a small sum, but an acknowledgment that the problem is important and real. Some Rwandan women Scharpf has interviewed say that the attention has made a difference in their homes: their husbands are now more willing to allow them to spend money on pads.\nWill banana-fiber sanitary pads succeed? No one knows. It is entirely possible that Scharpf will find that even if manufacturing goes smoothly \u2014 a huge \u201cif\u201d \u2014 there is simply not much of a market for sanitary pads in poor countries. Families may consider a 60- or 70-cent pack just as unaffordable as a $1.10 pack. Or suppose for a moment that everything goes perfectly, and pad franchises spread and families buy packets of pads for girls who are now missing school because of difficulties managing menstruation. Will those girls now stay in school? We can\u2019t be sure of that either.\nOne study in Nepal found that while girls appreciated help with hygiene, they weren\u2019t significantly more likely to attend school as a result. Menstrual cramps were more of an impediment than a lack of pads. And so aspirinlike medicines may need to be part of the solution as well. Research in Malawi by the Population Council suggests that bicycles would keep more kids in school than sanitary pads would. On the other hand, a study in Ghana suggests that supplying pads to rural girls there might reduce girls\u2019 absenteeism significantly.\nIn short, it\u2019s complicated. Scharpf is engaged in a noble experiment \u2014 but entrepreneurs fail sometimes. And anybody wrestling with poverty at home or abroad learns that good intentions and hard work aren\u2019t enough. Helping people is hard.\nIt\u2019s also clear that sanitary pads won\u2019t save the world. In the best case, Sustainable Health Enterprises will spread and make it easier for girls to go to school and women to work \u2014 but it will be only an incremental improvement. In the real world, that\u2019s usually how progress arrives (with screams of vexation along the way).\nFortunately, one factor buttressing D.I.Y. foreign aid is that altruism is contagious. In 2005, Lisa Shannon and her live-in boyfriend ran a stock photography business in Portland, Ore. But she was feeling a nagging emptiness, and then she happened to watch an \u201cOprah\u201d show about women suffering from war and rape in eastern Congo. The episode featured Zainab Salbi, an Iraqi-American who started an organization called Women for Women International to help such survivors in places like Congo. Shannon was dazzled by Salbi and decided to pitch in herself by cajoling friends to sponsor her for a 30-mile run to raise money for women in Congo.\nThat first run was exhilarating, and left Shannon with the warm, fuzzy and novel feeling that she was really doing some good in the world. After sponsoring several Congolese women and reading their letters, she founded an organization called Run for Congo Women that held fund-raising runs across America and around the world. Eventually, she made a trip to Congo and had a joyous meeting with her new \u201cfamily.\u201d She was bowled over when one of the women she sponsored introduced her baby girl: the mother named the baby \u201cLisa,\u201d after Shannon. She poured her soul into the cause, but her fianc\u00e9 grumbled as their business floundered. Finally he told her she had to choose: him or the Congolese women.\nSo in the end Shannon lost her business and her fianc\u00e9. She is struggling with no income, because she pays herself no salary and passes on all the money she raises to Women for Women International. Devoting yourself to helping others may seem wonderfully glamorous \u2014 until you\u2019re single, jobless and alone on a Saturday night. Shannon has taken in five roommates to share her house, and she saves pennies everywhere she can, but at some point she will become a pauper unless she finds a way of supporting herself.\nI caught up with Shannon earlier this year in Congo. She took me to see the Congolese Lisa, and also to visit the hut of the Congolese woman she\u2019s closest to, Generose Namburho, a 40-year-old former nurse. Namburho is a stocky, self-assured woman who led us down a mud path, using a crutch to replace her missing right leg. An extremist Hutu militia invaded Namburho\u2019s home a few years ago, killed her husband, raped her and then hacked off her leg with a knife. Then the soldiers cooked the flesh from her leg and forced her children at gunpoint to eat it. When her beloved oldest son refused, they shot him in front of her.\nShannon paid $1,500 to buy this home for Namburho so she would have somewhere to live after she returned from a stay in the hospital. \u201cI believe God sent Lisa to rescue me from my misery,\u201d Namburho told me, as Shannon squirmed in embarrassment.\nThis year Shannon organized one of her runs right there in Congo. Shannon ran alongside Namburho, who limped along with her crutch. \u201cShe said that if she could run on only one leg, then people would see that anybody could do this,\u201d Shannon said, adding: \u201cThat was probably the best day of my life. It was fantastic. It\u2019s one thing to support women rebuilding their lives, and another to see them emerge as leaders. We raised about $50,000, and these are women earning maybe $20 a month, and they raised money for other Congolese women.\u201d\nShannon has expanded her mandate this year, engaging in advocacy work to try to stop the rapes and killings in the first place. There are no simple solutions to the ongoing crisis in Congo, but Shannon has concentrated on embarrassing electronics makers, because they use parts that may contain minerals like tantalum from the area. Warlords sell these \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d and the idea is that if you can interrupt those supply chains, the warlords will find killing less profitable and may be more willing to negotiate.\nBy one estimate, auditing supply lines to assure an absence of conflict minerals could cost as little as a penny per finished cellphone, laptop or electronic camera. So early this year Shannon and other activists showed up at Intel\u2019s offices near her Oregon home with 45,000 pennies, representing the 45,000 people whose deaths can be attributed to the fighting in Congo each month, according to a mortality study by the International Rescue Committee. \u201cWe said we\u2019d be more than happy to pay a penny per product if that\u2018ll save lives,\u201d Shannon said. \u201cNobody at Intel would talk with us. They just sent a security person out. They wouldn\u2019t accept the pennies.\u201d\nSo Shannon jumped in her car with her mother, and they drove 11 hours down to Silicon Valley to the headquarters of Intel. There they made a similar pitch, and also visited Apple and Hewlett-Packard. Finally they dropped in on an Apple conference, and then an Apple Store opening in Washington. This was all quite uncomfortable for Shannon, who until then had been around like-minded activists who thought she was wonderful; now she was engaging in confrontational behavior and encountering people who thought she was na\u00efve, immature and boorish. One man told her to put down a sign with the word \u201crape,\u201d because he found it offensive \u2014 and all Shannon could think was that it should be even more offensive that so many Congolese women are raped.\nIn the end, Shannon\u2019s work \u2014 along with that of many, many other activists \u2014 seemed to make a difference. Some electronics companies became more aggressive about scrubbing supply chains of tainted minerals. Most important, Congress addressed the issue in this year\u2019s financial-reform law, which requires companies to disclose whether they use minerals from Congo or an adjoining country, and if they do use them, to reveal how the minerals were acquired. It\u2019s a step forward, and Shannon hopes that the result will be fewer Congolese enduring rapes and massacres.\nIt\u2019s striking that the most innovative activists aren\u2019t necessarily the ones with the most resources, or the best tools. If that were true, a team at the World Bank would have addressed the menstruation problem long ago, and G20 countries would be leading the effort to prevent Congolese warlords from monetizing their minerals. Rather, what often happens is that those best positioned to take action look the other way, and then the initiative is taken by the Scharpfs and Shannons of the world, who are fueled by some combustible mix of indignation and vision.\nMaggie Doyne epitomizes this truth, for she began her philanthropic work as an 19-year-old financed by her baby-sitting savings. Yet she has somehow figured out how to run a sophisticated aid project in a remote area of Nepal.\nDoyne grew up in New Jersey and excelled in high school \u2014 top grades, editor of the yearbook, three-sport varsity athlete \u2014 but felt burned out and unready to go to college when she graduated in 2005. So she took a \u201cgap year\u201d after high-school graduation and ended up in northern India, working with needy children. It was an impoverished area, yet Nepali refugees were pouring in and sleeping on the bare ground, fleeing civil war in their country. Doyne couldn\u2019t imagine what kind of conditions would be so bad that people would flee to where she was. So when the Maoist insurgency in Nepal calmed, she boarded a crammed public bus with a Nepali teenage girl to visit the girl\u2019s hometown. They got off, 48 hours and several bus breakdowns later, at the end of the bus line. Then Doyne and her friend hiked for another three days to the girl\u2019s home in the heartland of the Maoist insurgency.\nIt was a gorgeous Himalayan village, with a river running through it. But it was also ravaged by the war. Temples had been burned down, and the girl\u2019s home had been converted into a rebel camp. Most children couldn\u2019t afford school. In the cities, she had seen them working with hammers, breaking rocks into gravel to sell.\n\u201cThe first little girl I met was Hema,\u201d Doyne remembers. Then 6 or 7 years old (few children know their precise age), Hema spent her time breaking rocks and scavenging garbage and had no chance to go to school. But she was radiant and adorable and always greeted Doyne in Nepali with a warm, \u201cGood morning, Sister!\u201d\n\u201cMaybe I saw a piece of myself in her,\u201d said Doyne, who decided to take Hema under her wing and pay for her education: \u201cI knew I couldn\u2019t do anything about a million orphans, but what if I started with this girl?\u201d So she took Hema to school and paid $7 for the girl\u2019s school fees and another $8 for a uniform so that she could enter kindergarten.\n\u201cIt became addictive,\u201d Doyne said. \u201cI said, if I can help one girl, why not 5? Why not 10? And along with scholarships, they needed the most basic things: food, shelter, clothing.\u201d Doyne found a ramshackle telephone \u201cbooth\u201d \u2014 actually, a mud hut \u2014 where she could place an international call and telephoned her parents with a strange and urgent request: Can you wire me the money in my savings account? Doyne\u2019s parents were concerned about the choices she was making and the delay in going to college, but it was her money \u2014 $5,000 made baby-sitting while in high school \u2014 and they could hear the passion in her voice over a crackly line.\n\u201cIt was like being hit by a stun gun,\u201d recalled Maggie\u2019s mother, Nancy Doyne, a real estate agent. \u201cBut there\u2019s no stopping that child.\u201d Nancy Doyne worried about her daughter and had trouble sleeping when she thought of the perils of rural Nepal \u2014 but she also knew: \u201cI had to cut my string to that child and let her fly.\u201d So the parents sent Maggie the money, and she bought land and began working with villagers to build a shelter for orphans.\nDoyne returned to New Jersey and began to take odd jobs and proselytize for her shelter. People in her hometown thought that she was nuts, but in a benign way \u2014 and they wrote checks. After a few months, when Doyne had raised $25,000, she moved back to Nepal to oversee construction of the shelter, called the Kopila Valley Children\u2019s Home.\nThe first resident was a girl named Nisha, a 7- or 8-year-old whose parents had died and who had been sold to be a domestic servant. Nisha turned out to be a prodigy and quickly picked up English. In Nisha\u2019s first year of school, she skipped three grade levels. Nisha would scavenge old textbooks and read them on her own, then come to Doyne with questions. And while Doyne herself now speaks fluent Nepali, American volunteers who work with her often use Nisha as their interpreter. Less than three years after Doyne took her in, Nisha is a poised sixth grader with immense promise.\nThe children\u2019s home was soon overflowing with orphans, and Doyne was desperate for money to expand it. At that moment she received a call from CosmoGirl magazine. Now, Doyne never wears so much as lipstick in Nepal. If there\u2019s enough water, she showers \u2014 and if there isn\u2019t, she splashes\u00ad water on her face, brushes her teeth, puts her hair in a ponytail and is ready for another day. Sometimes she misses dating, but she has no boyfriend and has put her romantic life completely aside. \u201cMy main concern beauty-wise,\u201d she says, \u201cis trying to keep the lice out of my hair.\u201d\n\n10 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nBut now CosmoGirl was on the phone, telling her that she had won a $20,000 prize for her work, financed by Maybelline. Doyne could now pay to add second and third floors to her shelter and bring in more homeless orphans. \u201cIt gets even better!\u201d the woman on the phone went on excitedly. \u201cWe\u2019re going to whisk you away to New York for a Maybelline makeover!\u201d\nOnce Doyne expanded the children\u2019s home (and had her makeover, gaining false eyelashes and blond highlights\u2014 all very briefly), she began to focus on education. Last year, she won a $100,000 grand prize in a contest run by www.DoSomething.org, and that money provided the wherewithal to start a new school that she had long dreamed of. An Australian architect who met Doyne on Facebook flew to Nepal to design the buildings, and the project began taking shape. The school now has classes from kindergarten through sixth grade, as well as a library, a cafeteria and an outdoor auditorium. The plan is to expand it one year at a time until it is a high school as well.\nHaving become in effect a principal who never went to college, Doyne was passionate that the school would be academically outstanding. She recruited teachers who would forswear corporal punishment and encourage creativity rather than rote learning. The entire region has taken heed of Doyne\u2019s school project, with officials pleading for their children\u2019s admission. Some upper-caste parents were aghast that low-caste mothers would be preparing meals for upper-caste children, but they bit their lips and were silent in the hope that their children could attend. A one-hour enrollment session seeking just 40 children was swamped by 500 kids pleading for admission.\nThe school opened with 220 students and will soon expand to 300. The plan is to offer health care and dental care as well, starting with deworming the children \u2014 because their load of intestinal worms leaves them anemic. A $300 donation covers a child\u2019s educational costs for a year at the school, including health and dental care. Doyne is also working on a vocational element, training kids to raise livestock for a living, to repair bicycles or to develop other skills that will give them steady incomes. The school is coed, but the girls who attend are particularly important to Doyne, for two reasons. One is that uneducated girls are particularly at risk of exploitation. The other is that there\u2019s considerable evidence that educating girls is one of the best investments available in the developing world, because it leads to lower birth rates and a more skilled and productive labor force.\nAs for her own needs, Doyne is blas\u00e9. When she had an infected tooth in a remote village far from any doctor, and her face swelled up so that she couldn\u2019t even see, a local man obligingly took a chisel and pliers and pulled the tooth \u2014 without any painkiller. Regarding education, Doyne is thinking about earning a college degree by correspondence someday (my hunch is that she\u2019ll have an honorary doctorate before she has a B.A.). Listening to her chatter about her shelter and school, describing her hopes to replicate her model in other countries, it\u2019s easy to forget something quite extraordinary: she\u2019s still only 23.\nIt\u2019s fair to object that activists like Doyne are accomplishing results that, however noble, are minuscule. Something like 101 million children aren\u2019t attending primary school around the world, so 220 kids in Doyne\u2019s school constitute the teensiest drop in the bucket. The larger problem can be solved only if governments make education a top priority (which they haven\u2019t), just as ending the wars in Congo may require the concerted action of states. Well-meaning individuals like Doyne help at the edges but don\u2019t fundamentally change the nature of the challenge; indeed, charitable construction of schools and hospitals may sometimes free up governments in poor countries to use their money to buy weapons instead.\nAll that is true \u2014 but it\u2019s equally true that if you happen to be that drop in the bucket, Doyne is transforming your life. And afterward, you may become an education advocate as well, transforming other people\u2019s lives. As Doyne herself puts it, \u201cIf your own children were born orphans in Nepal, you wouldn\u2019t wait for the U.N or the government to do something about it while they were hungry and cold and breaking rocks by the side of a riverbed.\u201d\nOf course, not everyone is ready to move off to Nepal and exchange bar-hopping for lice-minimization. Many people want to connect to a cause larger than themselves, but they are busy and juggling priorities, have limited time and don\u2019t know quite what to do. There\u2019s a market failure there: so many people who would like to help, and so many people who would benefit from that help, but there\u2019s a shortage of channels to connect them. (On my blog, nytimes.com/ontheground, I\u2019ve listed some practical ideas for how to help as well as contact information for organizations working at the grass roots \u2014 including those mentioned in this article.)\nThe challenge is to cultivate an ideology of altruism, to spread a culture of social engagement \u2014 and then to figure out what people can do at a practical level. Peter Singer, a Princeton University professor, is the philosopher of this effort, and it has a thousand foot soldiers. In Seattle, for example, a couple named Eugene and Minhee Cho are encouraging middle-class Americans to think of themselves as philanthropists, every bit as much as Bill Gates is. Eugene is a minister and Minhee a stay-at-home mom who looks after their three children but recently returned to grad school. They were moved by the suffering they\u2019d seen around the world, but they weren\u2019t well off and didn\u2019t know what they could do to make a difference. Then Eugene happened to take a trip to Burma, visited a school and saw how tiny sums could keep children in class. \u201cThat kind of wrecked my life,\u201d Eugene says, laughing.\nAfter the trip, they resolved that for one year they would donate all their earnings \u2014 Eugene\u2019s salary of $68,000 \u2014 to Burmese education and other charities to show that you don\u2019t have to be a zillionaire to be generous. Later, they founded One Day\u2019s Wages, which asks people to donate a single day\u2019s pay \u2014 0.4 percent of annual income \u2014 to various causes and organizations that they have vetted and put on their Web site. Forsaking a year\u2019s salary was a romantic idea when the Chos conceived it, but life without paychecks turned out to be brutal, even humiliating. They exhausted their life\u2019s savings, and Eugene sold his beloved car. With several months to go, they had to sublet their home and become homeless \u2014 taking their children and moving onto friends\u2019 couches. \u201cThat was the most painful decision I\u2019ve had to make as a father,\u201d Eugene says.\nThe One Day\u2019s Wages campaign has proved more practicable. In the past year, the Chos have raised more than $400,000, all of which will be forwarded to the organizations they work with. About 60 percent of the donors have been women or girls, they think, the youngest being a 6-year-old who gave up her birthday presents and started a birthday campaign on the onedayswages.org Web site. \u201cThe aim is to inspire the everyday person,\u201d Eugene says, summing up the rise of do-it-yourself foreign aid. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to communicate that you don\u2019t have to be a rock star or a millionaire to make a difference.\u201d",

    "text": "A Female Approach to Peacekeeping\n2010-03-05T20:34:40.000Z\nMONROVIA, LIBERIA \u2014 When darkness comes to Congo Town, women in crisp uniforms take the streets, patrolling with Kalashnikov rifles and long, black hair tucked into baby-blue caps. \nThe brisk sergeant in command, Monia Gusain, matter of factly calls them \u201cmy men.\u201d But the stern Indian women facing her are actually wives and mothers who wage peace for a living on the rutted dirt roads of Liberia. \nThe women \u2014 part of a special female United Nations police unit from India \u2014 lead dual lives: stamping out street crime by night and standing guard under the steamy equatorial sun outside the Monrovia headquarters of the Liberian president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. When they retreat, home is a military barracks where they tell bedtime stories to their toddlers via video conference calls. \nTogether they form the thin pink line of a U.N. recruitment campaign for the 21st century. As it marks the 100th International Women\u2019s Day on March 8, the United Nations is intensifying efforts to recruit women for peacekeeping missions that seek to mend what war has wrought.\nThe theory \u2014 which has evolved since pioneering female peacekeepers started participating in U.N. missions in the Balkans in the 1990s \u2014 is that women employ distinctive social skills in a rugged macho domain. They are being counted on to bring calm to the streets and the barracks, acting as public servants instead of invaders. \n\u201cWhen female soldiers are present, the situation is closer to real life, and as a result the men tend to behave,\u201d said Gerard J. DeGroot, a history professor at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland who has written books about women in the military. \u201cAny conflict where you have an all-male army, it\u2019s like a holiday from reality. If you inject women into that situation, they do have a civilizing effect.\u201d\nAs modern peacekeeping has evolved into nation building, the number of female police officers in U.N. peacekeeping missions around the world has doubled during the past five years to 833, or more than 6 percent of a force of 12,867. Nigeria and India are top contributors to a total that is still far below the international goal of 20 percent. In some missions \u2014 notably Darfur and Liberia \u2014 women are edging closer: Women account for 14 percent of the 1,354 police peacekeepers in Liberia. \nLiberia \u2014 a West African country created in 1847 to settle freed American slaves \u2014 is something of a modern laboratory for the rise of women making peace. Women are marching in foot patrols; the head of the U.N. mission, Ellen Margrethe Loj of Denmark, is a woman; and the Liberian president, Mrs. Sirleaf, is the first woman elected as an African head of state, in 2005.\nMrs. Sirleaf \u2014 whose nickname is \u201cIron Lady\u201d \u2014 is particularly blunt about the role of women in the recovery of her fragile country, which was battered by 14 years of civil war that left about 200,000 people dead and survivors haunted by torture, systematic rapes and the exploitation of drug-addicted boy soldiers. \n\u201cWhat a woman brings to the task is extra sensitivity, more caring,\u201d Mrs. Sirleaf said in an interview. \u201cI think that these are the characteristics that come from being a mother, taking care of a family, being concerned about children, managing the home.\u201d \nThe softer approach is critical in Liberia. In 2004, a U.N. report criticized peacekeepers in Liberia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Haiti for the sexual abuse of young women by trading food and money for sex. In 2005, 47 peacekeepers were accused of sexual abuse in Liberia, compared with 18 peacekeepers who were accused last year, according to the U.N. mission.\nTop U.N. officials credit the arrival of women for helping improve behavior. Yet within Liberia, national peacekeeping units from different countries are still debating the best approach, tinkering with ways to best deploy female peacekeepers \u2014 or \u201cblue helmettes\u201d in U.N. lingo.\nThe contingents from India and Nigeria have both settled into Liberian outposts with contrasting approaches that raise a simple question: Should female peacekeepers be mixed with male peacekeepers?\n The Nigerian Approach \nFrom a dusty military base on Old Road, outside Monrovia, the capital, Lt. Col. Joseph Ogbonna presides over a battalion of men and women from Nigeria, the first country to send peacekeepers to Liberia, in 2003.\nThe Nigerian women \u2014 who number 59, or 5 percent of 1,159 officers \u2014 hold largely traditional jobs, including working as cooks, nurses, supply clerks, police officers, teachers and refugee workers, said Colonel Ogbonna, who argues that women are more disciplined. \nSome of the male peacekeepers joke uneasily that the women are getting too much attention. Brig. Gen. Ebiowei Awala said he notices a change in himself when women are present. He lowers his voice when talking to men and women, softening his language.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like any household,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the mother culture is there, people change.\u201d\nThe Nigerian women live in narrow barracks tacked with photos of smiling little boys and girls in frothy dresses left behind in the care of husbands or relatives. \nThe trade-off is adventure, financial opportunity and the chance to aid a weak nation. \n\u201cI came here to make peace in this country,\u201d said Olayiwola Olanike, 50, a staff sergeant, nurse and mother of two who arrived five months ago and tends Liberian patients at a special free clinic. But the beginning was difficult; she missed her family, and the torrential rainy season was a thundering force. Malaria was constant, Sergeant Olanike said. \nCharity Charamba, a Zimbabwean who is operations coordinator for the U.N. police, said she had almost turned back before leaving for Liberia because her husband and sons, 19 and 11, were miserable.\n\u201cIt is a tough decision to leave a family, and this is why most female officers find it difficult to come to the mission,\u201d Ms. Charamba said, recalling the tug of 2 a.m. telephone calls from her younger son demanding intercession: \u201cMommy, Daddy is not listening to me.\u201d\nIn their peacekeeping roles, one of their usual duties is reaching out to other mothers and their children.\nCpl. Kehinde Dbadamoisi, 42, is an 18-year military veteran and mother of three sons ages 8 to 16. She wears an olive Nigerian uniform in a Monrovia classroom where she is deployed as a biology teacher. \nInitially, the school\u2019s principal, A. Darkpay Johnson, worried that Liberian students would fear the imposing woman in uniform.\n\u201cBut you can see that when she asks questions, they answer,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \nOutside the classroom, Corporal Dbadamoisi said her uniform had no effect.\n\u201cThe children love us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the way that you interact with them that matters. If you can pass along lessons to students, they admire you.\u201d \nShe said she had been drawn to Liberia for the challenge and the opportunity to do anything in the military. \nIndeed, in some respects, Nigerian women have taken up so many tasks with the men that they have also shared the bleak side.\nFor many military and police officers from poorer nations, a main attraction of peacekeeping is a special allowance financed by the United Nations and disbursed to the home countries of peacekeepers. It adds up to about $1,000 a month, which \u2014 for peacemakers from third world countries \u2014 can be equivalent to five times their base pay. \nIn April, 27 Nigerian peacekeepers in Liberia \u2014 three of them young women \u2014 were convicted of mutiny by a military court and given life sentences for participating in demonstrations in Nigeria in 2008 to protest the embezzlement of their peacekeeping allowances. \nThe life sentences were later commuted to seven-year prison sentences, a much harsher punishment than for those who took the money. The Nigerian officers accused of embezzling $68,541 and diverting the allowances to another military unit were demoted. \n The Indian Approach \nSince early in 2007, Indian women have stood guard outside the president\u2019s office on the main street in Monrovia. \nIt is a highly symbolic post, even for critics who complain that the women \u2014 whose English is weaker than their Hindi \u2014 have minimal contact with the local population.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think women in peacekeeping have come across to the Liberian people,\u201d said John Richardson, an adviser to Charles Taylor, the former Liberian president, who remains popular in Liberia although he is on trial in The Hague on war crimes charges. \nStill, another close Taylor supporter, Cyril Allen \u2014 chairman emeritus of the former ruling party \u2014 sees advantages because of the country\u2019s divisions.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that Liberian women should be carrying guns and standing in front of the president,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know where their loyalty is.\u201d\nThe Indian unit of 103 women also plays a more unsung role, mentoring unarmed local Liberian police officers who must deal with the lingering suspicions of citizens who resented police participation in the civil war.\nOn the streets of Congo Town, a Monrovia suburb where crime rates soared after the war, supporters credit old-fashioned Indian foot patrols with cutting armed robberies by as much as 65 percent, according to Gostine Hallie, a Congo Town police chief who trudges on patrols with the women. \n\u201cSince we started foot patrols, the crime has considerably reduced, and we\u2019re getting maximum cooperation from local people,\u201d said Mr. Hallie, whose station only recently received electricity.\nFrom their base in Monrovia, the Indian unit is also credited by the local police academy for encouraging increased reporting of sexual abuse and inspiring recruitment of Liberian women for the national police, which had 602 women last year, or about 15 percent of the force of 4,019.\nMost of the Indian women were leaving their country for the first time when they joined the U.N. mission in Liberia. Their English is often shaky, but their commanders say they have established a rapport.\nDuring the Liberian civil war, \u201cit was the men who inflicted harm on women, and most of the time the sufferers were women and children,\u201d said Annie Abraham, 45, the commanding officer of the Indian unit that just finished its rotation and was replaced by new recruits. \u201cWhen you have male peacekeepers, you get the feeling that the women are more intimidated. Women aren\u2019t as aggressive as the men. Women don\u2019t speak as loudly as the men.\u201d\nThe Indian contingent has brought along 22 men, who are the cooks, mechanics and drivers who support the female unit.\nThe abilities to drive a manual transmission vehicle and fire weapons are often critical barriers for female peacekeepers. The Canadian government and the Pearson Peacekeeping Center in Ottawa have donated vehicles and organized driving lessons in Ghana for peacekeepers. \nOn the street, the Indian women are perceived as sober and intimidating, but the biggest menace in the barracks is homesickness and depression.\nTo counter the blues and connect with Liberians, the unit organized Indian festivals, Bollywood dancing lessons and the \u201cadoption\u201d of a school and orphanage.\n\u201cThat was the way we could reach out and build trust,\u201d Ms. Abraham said. The idea, built on offering solace, is a strategy that the United Nations is preparing to study to explore the effects of female paramilitary units \u2014 particularly with Bangladesh poised to dispatch a new women\u2019s unit of peacekeepers. \n\u201cWe need to go deeper to study the impact that this is having and what aspect is really a good practice,\u201d said Carole Doucet, the senior gender adviser for the U.N. Mission in Liberia. \u201cWe need to be careful about saying it\u2019s fantastic. We need to know why.\u201d\nSome women have found the challenge of leading a life far from their family too daunting. As female participation grows, that issue will be critical for the United Nations, which is considering shorter, more flexible rotations.\n\u201cNo more missions \u2014 it\u2019s the first and the last because it\u2019s difficult for me as a mother,\u201d said Syalus Maharana, an Indian operations commander who finished her yearlong tour along with the daily ritual of mothering her 5-year-old son by hourlong video conference calls. \n\u201cHe\u2019s being looked after nicely and he is not missing me, but I am missing him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe tells me, \u2018Mama, are you using a mosquito net?\u2019 He is advising me, and I should be advising him.\u201d\nMs. Maharana came for the challenge, travel and financial opportunities, but she left Africa in late February with a few life lessons from Liberians, particularly one exotic notion. \n\u201cIn India, a male child is preferred, but in Liberia they do not use methods to stop a girl child coming into the world,\u201d she said. \u201cFor them, a male child and girl child are equal. I think that\u2019s positive.\u201d",

    "text": "Cass Sunstein Wants to Nudge Us\n2010-05-13T19:32:05.000Z\nThe professors in Hyde Park believe in something called the University of Chicago mind. It runs cold and analytical when the rest of the culture runs hot. Chicago scholars tend to be social scientists at heart, contrarian but empirical, following evidence to logical extremes. They are centrally interested not in what it is like to be an individual within society but in how society washes over individuals, making and remaking them. During the campaign, when his former Chicago colleagues were asked to detail Barack Obama\u2019s intellectual evolution, many of them described him in these terms. But they knew Obama, at best, only partly exhibited this tradition. His friend Cass Sunstein, who is certainly the most productive and probably the most influential liberal legal scholar of his generation, inherited it in full. \u201cCass has,\u201d says Saul Levmore, a former dean of the law school, \u201cthe quintessential University of Chicago habit of mind.\u201d\nI met Sunstein for the first time last fall, at an Au Bon Pain near the White House, just after he abandoned some measure of academic fame to run the White House\u2019s little-known Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. The office, known in Washington as OIRA, reviews major regulations written by federal agencies (on matters like the environment, the financial system, Medicare and Medicaid and public health and safety). Republicans have seen OIRA as a powerful tool to check the regulatory instincts of some agencies. But Sunstein wants to use OIRA to make regulations more supple, not less robust. Government regulations can operate at the level of philosophy, elaborating how you weigh the interest of the individual against that of society, of the present against the future. Sunstein\u2019s influence at OIRA might help give the government a University of Chicago mind.\nI could see Sunstein coming toward me a block away \u2014 bald and lean, his body tilted enthusiastically forward, at an angle to the ground. Sunstein, who is 55, has an almost childlike excitement \u2014 his e-mail messages end in long strings of exclamation points, and when other academics talk about his mind, they do so in the way people talk about the ballet, as something precious that ought to bepreserved. When his friends imitate him, they make their voices higher and gentler, and they introduce a quaver.\nThe summer before Obama\u2019s election, Sunstein married the crusading anti-genocide journalist Samantha Power, now a senior director at the National Security Council. Despite Sunstein\u2019s reputation as a nonideological technician, he seems romantically drawn to fiercely moral public intellectuals \u2014 his previous long-term relationship was with the philosopher Martha Nussbaum. In 2008, Sunstein and Power seemed to so perfectly symbolize the intellectual aspirations of the Obama administration and its faith in expertise that they were photographed by Esquire dressed for squash.\nSunstein\u2019s world is filled with experts. When a White House spokesman sent me an initial list of Sunstein friends that I should speak with, it began with three Nobel Prize winners. Colleagues have long marveled at his graphomania. He has published hundreds of articles and roughly three dozen books, two of which appeared while he was waiting almost five months to be confirmed by the Senate last year. \u201cCass has no psychological relationship to writing at all,\u201d Power told me. He knows he has a reputation for distraction. Several academics I spoke to wondered whether his elbows could be sharpened sufficiently for Washington \u2014 he was not exactly Rahm Emanuel. I asked Sunstein about this. He smiled and affected a macho tone. \u201cWho the\u201d \u2014 here he uttered an expletive associated with Rahm Emanuel \u2014 \u201csays my personality is not like Rahm Emanuel\u2019s?\u201d\nWhen Sunstein moved into his new office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building last September, Washington was a brittle place \u2014 the financial cataclysm still hung over everything. Sunstein saw in the housing collapse, he told me, a \u201ccascadelike process.\u201d People thought they could handle more risk than they really could, and the regulatory system permitted too much systemic risk. Some of these errors were a result of legislation, but many were caused more quietly, by tiny rules issued by federal agencies \u2014 the kinds of regulations over which Sunstein now has some authority.\nIf you think about it \u2014 and Sunstein certainly has \u2014 you can see a similar problem in one of the fields OIRA deals with often: the environment. The small risks that people or companies take (in adding increments of carbon to the atmosphere or \u2014 as in the case of the recent Gulf Coast oil spill \u2014 maintaining drilling rigs) sometimes threaten to cascade into a catastrophe. So how can the government change the framework of choices that particular people are faced with so that their own small errors in risk perception don\u2019t expose the whole of society?\n\u2202Part of the reason that Sunstein is so admired as an academic is that he has inherited lessons from everyone, including conservatives. When we spoke, he made a point of emphasizing the influence of icons of the right, like the libertarian economist Friedrich von Hayek and the originalist legal scholars. As a young academic, Sunstein found himself deeply moved by the society Franklin D. Roosevelt envisioned \u2014 he wrote a book championing F.D.R.\u2019s idea of a \u201csecond bill of rights\u201d that would guarantee Americans a job, an education and a home \u2014 but he accepts that much of the New Deal amounted to \u201cmorals without technique.\u201d \u201cIn 2010 there\u2019s so much more knowledge about economics than there was in the \u201930s,\u201d Sunstein told me. \u201cA lot of what I\u2019ve tried to do is hold on to some of these moral commitments of the Roosevelt administration and figure out how we might actually get them.\u201d\nIn \u201cNudge,\u201d a popular book that he wrote with the influential behavioral economist Richard Thaler, Sunstein elaborated a philosophy called \u201clibertarian paternalism.\u201d Conservative economists have long stressed that because people are rational, the best way for government to serve the public is to guarantee a fair market and to otherwise get out of the way. But in the real world, Sunstein and Thaler argue, people are subject to all sorts of biases and quirks. They also argue that this human quality, which some would call irrationality, can be predicted and \u2014 this is the controversial part \u2014 that if the social environment can be changed, people might be nudged into more rational behavior.\nLibertarian paternalists would have school cafeterias put the fruit before the fried chicken, because students are more likely to grab the first food they see. They support a change in Illinois law that asks drivers renewing their licenses to choose whether they want to be organ donors. The simple act of having to choose meant that more people signed up. Ideas like these, taking human idiosyncrasies into account, might revive an old technocratic hope: that society could be understood so perfectly that it might be improved. The elaboration of behavioral economics, which seeks to uncover the ways in which people are predictably irrational, \u201cis the most exciting intellectual development of my lifetime,\u201d Sunstein told me.\nMaybe so, but the paradox of libertarian paternalism is that it terrifies both libertarians and paternalists. (Its natural audience is professors, who often love it.) Conservatives see a Big Brother strain in Sunstein\u2019s philosophy (Glenn Beck called him \u201cthe most dangerous guy out there\u201d), while some liberals worry that behavioral economics is too immature to handle the weight of guiding policy. \u201cRight now we\u2019re in a Keynesian moment,\u201d William Galston, a longtime Democratic Party insider who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told me after Obama took office. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to nudge the system back. We\u2019ll drag it back.\u201d\nKeynes was the theorist of an earlier generation of liberalism, whose ideas Sunstein wanted to refine, and I asked him about Galston\u2019s critique. \u201cI would reject the distinction between a Keynesian moment and a behavioral moment,\u201d Sunstein said. His voice was so quiet it barely came through on my recording of the interview. \u201cKeynes emphasized the role of what he called animal spirits on the economy. He saw the crucial role of confidence. The \u2018cash for clunkers\u2019 program was a big success in part because it gave people the sense that the economy was moving. So Keynes was in this dimension an early behavioral economist.\u201d\nDuring the 2008 presidential campaign, Sunstein went to Iowa on Obama\u2019s behalf with his friend Austan Goolsbee, now a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, and Goolsbee\u2019s friend from college Samantha Power. Sunstein got in such an involved conversation with a voter that he left Goolsbee and Power outside, shivering in the snow. The three joked that, between their three sprawling areas of expertise, they had almost any potential question about Obama covered. They failed at the first door, when a voter wanted to know the location of the nearest caucus.\nSunstein and Power, who is 39, soon went on a date, and she asked him if he ever fantasized about doing anything else. \u201cI expected him to say he dreamed of playing for the Red Sox,\u201d she told me. \u201cHis eyes got real big and he said: \u2018Ooh! OIRA!\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cAnd I said, \u2018What the hell is that?\u2019 \u201d\nThe office that Sunstein occupies is a kind of cockpit for the modern administrative state. When Congress passes new laws, many of the details are delegated to executive-branch agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency or the Food and Drug Administration. Officials in the Reagan administration, aiming to chasten the bureaucracy, gave OIRA the power to review every significant new rule that emerged from these agencies and to decide whether the benefits (in health, safety or environmental protection) were greater than what it would cost society to comply. Business groups quickly learned that OIRA was the place where they might get a favorable hearing. The office gained the reputation, legal scholars say, as a graveyard of regulation.\nThe office\u2019s administrators require that federal agencies express the costs and benefits of their proposed rules (lives saved, swampland preserved) in dollars. Moral principles, filtered through this cost-benefit analysis, find their way into confounding little boxes. A human life, the E.P.A. figured in a 2001 rule about arsenic and drinking water, was worth $6.1 million. (If an environmental regulation would save one life but cost $4 million, it ought to be put into effect; if it cost $8 million to save that life, the regulation would be scuttled.) Each I.Q. point a child lost because of exposure to lead was worth $8,346 over the course of a lifetime. A lost workday was worth $83. Many of these estimates used data from surveys \u2014 taken at malls, among other places \u2014 that asked passers-by how much more they would need to be paid to take on a job that carried, for instance, a 1-in-10,000 risk of death. Richard Posner, who has the most magnificent and chilly mind in this realm, used similar projections to price the benefit of preventing the extinction of the human race at $600 trillion.\nSunstein, steeped in the literature of behavioral economics, suggests that this abstract, utilitarian method might be humanized and reconciled with the world in which people actually live. His longtime friend Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor of The New Republic, compared Sunstein\u2019s discovery of behavioral economics with the moment when the philosopher John Stuart Mill, a utilitarian, fell ill and lost himself in the poetry of Samuel Coleridge. \u201cIt was an intellectual revolution that permitted him to get away from utilitarianism,\u201d Wieseltier told me, and to acknowledge \u201cthe centrality of emotions to human affairs. . . . Behavioral economics played a role like that in Cass\u2019s life.\u201d\nBehavioral economists have replaced the rational actor in economic models with an often befuddled character \u2014 bedeviled by impulses and sentiments, overwhelmed by choice. The Obama administration has tried to explain the world to this new economic actor by providing new kinds of information in new ways. When I visited Sunstein in December in his office in Washington, he talked me through some of his favorite examples. During the 1980s, the E.P.A. made public the list of the companies that released the largest quantities of toxic chemicals into their communities and hoped for a loud public shaming that would get them to clean up. Amazingly, it worked, and now the agency is trying something similar with greenhouse-gas emissions. Sunstein was also enthusiastic, he told me, about plans to change the reporting requirements for a car\u2019s fuel economy, so that consumers would have a better sense of how much they would probably spend on gas over a vehicle\u2019s lifetime. And one of the most publicized insights of \u201cNudge\u201d was that many fewer people take advantage of tax-free individual retirement accounts than would benefit from them. The Obama administration has given employers incentives to automatically enroll their workers in 401(k) plans \u2014 the employees are able to opt out of the plans if they want to.\nSome scholars dislike the strong, if subtle, governmental hand that is embedded in this last proposal. It seems more forceful than a nudge. \u201cOnce you get to a point where you have automatic enrollment, you raise the question, What kind of fund?\u201d Mario Rizzo, a professor of economics at New York University, says. \u201cThe problem is that if you were enrolled automatically, you could complain later that you\u2019d been put into either a too-risky or a too-conservative fund. So then you micromanage that and you say you have to have a balanced fund. But pretty soon you\u2019re on a slippery slope, where you\u2019re dictating people\u2019s retirement choices.\u201d Rizzo told me about an academic study of gift-giving that found that most people would value cash more highly than the gifts they get for holidays; if even your friends and family can\u2019t figure out what you want, he asked, how can a distant bureaucrat? \u201cSunstein is very taken with the need for experts,\u201d Rizzo says. \u201cBut it turns out experts are subject to these cognitive quirks, too.\u201d\nSunstein takes this last problem very seriously. Thaler, his co-author and friend, mentioned it to me in the context of the financial cataclysm. No matter how many Ph.D.\u2019s in finance, for instance, the S.E.C. hired, they would never know enough to run Wall Street. The trick, Sunstein says, is to crack the rule-making process open. Last month, Sunstein issued a directive allowing the agencies to solicit feedback on their proposed regulations through social media like wikis and blogs. \u201cHardly anyone would isolate Section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act\u201d \u2014 the law that governs the public notice-and-comment period for most federal rules \u2014 \u201cas the greatest invention of modern government,\u201d Sunstein told me in his office late last year, his eyes filled with life. \u201cBut I see it as having potential.\u201d\nIn late 2000, scientists working in Antarctica began to withdraw drills that had spent weeks boring deep into the ice. It took an hour or two for each drill to emerge to the surface. Two engineers were needed to lift the extract: 10-foot cylinders of ancient ice, with a half-million-year climate record contained in the gas bubbles trapped inside. The ice cores were so old that the bubbles had been compressed beyond visibility, and so the samples looked impeccably clear. But when the samples were shipped back to laboratories where they were placed inside vacuums and pulverized with tiny needles, they released ancient air, which scientists captured to examine.\nAs the scientists analyzed the record, they found what would become crucial evidence of climate change: for 800,000 years, the level of carbon in the atmosphere oscillated gently within a confined range; after World War II, the carbon levels broke the top of the range and continued, unabated, upward. Scientists grappled with two emerging truths: that carbon emissions were changing the earth\u2019s climate, and that we had no certain historical reference points that would allow us to estimate the damage. \u201cWhat you have is a link of very tenuous inferences, where each link is very highly uncertain,\u201d says Martin Weitzman, a professor of economics at Harvard.\nThese findings had a tidal effect on economics and regulation. In his early days at the White House, Sunstein spent as much time working on climate change as on any single issue. \u201cThe rules that govern climate change are unquestionably the most important that Sunstein will have to deal with,\u201d Thomas McGarity, who teaches environmental law at the University of Texas, told me. Because of the vast uncertainties involved, climate change offers a profound test of the capacities of cost-benefit analysis. Whatever action Congress takes, some of the most difficult questions lie in the regulatory details that will be subject to review by Sunstein and OIRA: how much of our wealth will the government sacrifice to try to prevent the world\u2019s climate from changing, and how will we value the interests of the future against those of the present?\nFor years, Sunstein has wrestled in his writing with the difficulty in estimating the possibility of catastrophe \u2014 studies of insurance markets have found that we tend to ignore small risks until their probability passes a certain threshold, at which point we overspend wildly to prevent them. Our public assumptions about costs and benefits are often similarly out of whack. We probably spent too little on air security before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Sunstein says. Afterward we have struggled to calibrate the appropriate response. Likewise, the threat of catastrophic climate change bedevils even experts. How do you account for a small but real chance that the global sea level will rise by 20 feet?\nIn OIRA\u2019s cost-benefit calculations, the government\u2019s willingness to spend depends on how expensive the damage will be \u2014 on what economists call the social cost of carbon. Sunstein and others in the government have spent several months trying to define this cost, and he talked me through the process.\u00a0One of the most important issues is the discount rate, which suggests how much present value should be assigned to costs or benefits that will be experienced in the future. If given a choice between paying $1 million now and $1 million five years from now, economists realize that individuals and governments will want to pay later. If people depreciate future costs by 3 percent a year, $1 million five years from now is only worth about $860,000 today. Over very long periods, like those involved in climate change, the discount rates that are applied to short-term problems like budgets build toward absurdity: using one common method, spending $1 million to forestall climate change in 2100 would be valued today at $2,300. Calculations like this seem to argue against doing anything now. The problem, Sunstein says, is that we might do irreversible damage to the planet while blithely waiting for the price of action to drop just enough.\nThe debates over the discount rate are less mathematical than moral. Spending money now to prevent climate damage that won\u2019t appear for decades is a tax on present generations; declining to spend now is a tax on the future. The British government several years ago assigned the economist Nicholas Stern to value the cost of climate change. Stern\u2019s vision was nightmarish. He envisioned melting glaciers that would threaten one-sixth of the world\u2019s population, mostly in South Asia, the Andes and parts of China; rising temperatures that would starve much of Africa, where crops would have difficulty growing; and worldwide plagues of malaria and dengue fever. Stern set the discount rate at 1.4 percent, a figure that would call for vast action, immediately.\nAs an academic, Sunstein seemed to side with economists like William Nordhaus at Yale, who set the discount rate at about 5 percent, which would counsel patience. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear what direction the risk of error cuts in,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf we err, 7 percent could be bad,\u201d he said, but \u201cif we err, 1 percent could be bad also.\u201d A low discount rate might protect the environment by spurring us to sacrifice now \u2014 while damaging the economy, increasing poverty and putting more people out of work. The difficulty is that the experts are lined up \u201cout the door and down the block on both sides of this issue,\u201d one economist told me. Sunstein has urged long and detailed public comment. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get a wide range of views,\u201d he said. But in some cases \u2014 in the case of climate change \u2014 the problem isn\u2019t just that experts don\u2019t know enough. The problem is that nobody knows enough, and still the government has to choose.\nLast month, a small new regulation appeared in the Federal Register that seemed to augur a quiet cataclysm: it revised energy standards for small motors, of all things, but in doing so the E.P.A. considered, for the first time, the social cost of carbon using a governmentwide standard. The expectation is that each new regulation that governs carbon production \u2014 among them, the fuel-economy rule for automobiles \u2014 will now consider its social cost, using the standard, which was developed by an interagency group inside the Obama administration. The group counted the consequences of warming not just in the United States but all over the world \u2014 crops withering in Africa, dikes overtopped in Bangladesh.\nThe interagency group made some choices \u2014 Stern\u2019s apocalyptic model was out; Nordhaus\u2019s more moderate model was in. \u201cTo enshrine these Pollyannaish studies and never look at the Stern Review \u2014 it\u2019s not a technocratic middle of the road; it\u2019s a political choice,\u201d says Frank Ackerman, an environmental economist at Tufts. Ackerman says that the discount rate the government prefers \u2014 3 percent \u2014 isn\u2019t low enough. \u201cIt nowhere captures the urgency of the science.\u201d\nSunstein won\u2019t defend a discount rate as low as Stern\u2019s \u2014 the expenses it would require are, for him, prohibitive. But he says the government has weighed the possibility of environmental catastrophe, of events that are unlikely to occur but not quite dismissible, into the social cost of carbon. The interagency group wanted to recognize, Sunstein told me, \u201csome of the ethical and economic judgments that some economists have that lead to a lower discount rate.\u201d\nOne of the last papers Sunstein wrote as an academic concerned the fate of animals under environmental change \u2014 many species will quite likely become extinct if the planet continues to warm, but their fates had never previously been accounted for in a mathematical model that could be used by the government for cost-benefit analysis. Sunstein tried to do that, in a paper in which he wrote with feeling about the suffering of polar bears \u2014 starving cubs dependent on mothers unable to hunt in melting ice. It seemed to the environmentalists that his sympathies were with them. But to them, Sunstein\u2019s moral judgment seemed compromised by his quest for a perfect technique and his insistence on counting things that were impossible to count. \u201cYou don\u2019t spend that long at the University of Chicago,\u201d McGarity told me, \u201cwithout some of that thinking rubbing off on you.\u201d\nThe University of Chicago, during the \u201980s and \u201990s, was the great seat of conservative scholarship \u2014 law and economics, public-choice theory, constitutional originalism. Sunstein, as a young scholar, found himself both \u201cin awe\u201d of these movements and convinced \u201cthat my smartest colleagues were blundering, and I couldn\u2019t explain to myself why.\u201d When Sunstein and Thaler presented their attack, using behavioral insights, on the rational-actor model that undergirded more-traditional economic thinking, they delivered it to a tense classroom that included conservative skeptics. It was an atmosphere, Sunstein said, that felt \u201ca little like war.\u201d\nSunstein spent two decades wrestling with this conservative literature, and the theories that he elaborated bore marks of those struggles and traces of their influence. \u201cWhat makes Cass unique is that he does not dismiss these critiques but incorporates them, and seeks to build upon them,\u201d the Chicago law professor Eric Posner told me.\nYet when Sunstein first became, last summer, a familiar figure to Glenn Beck\u2019s radio audience, it was as an animal rights fanatic \u2014 endlessly mocked for having once proposed in an academic article that advocates might be granted the right to sue on behalf of abused animals, and for his suggestion that hunting was morally indefensible. Beck\u2019s Sunstein has evolved, over time, into an avatar of a perceived Big Brother strain in the Obama administration, its secret manipulation of national life. \u201cThis is what Cass Sunstein does,\u201d Beck said on his radio program last month. \u201cHe nudges. He moves. He slides into position.\u201d\nSunstein had, during his academic career, a penchant for publishing trial balloons \u2014 they were a necessary part of his inquiry, a perpetual what if? Now, with their author a government official, some of these conjectures seem more worrisome. Sunstein has, for example, written often about the corrosive effects of rumors and falsehoods on democratic discourse (it is the subject of one of the two books that were published while he was waiting to be confirmed last year), and in a 2008 paper, he proposed that government agents \u201ccognitively infiltrate\u201d chat rooms and message boards to try to debunk conspiracy theories before they spread. The paper was narrowly concerned with terrorism, but to some, these were dark musings. The liberal essayist Glenn Greenwald, writing in Salon, called the proposal \u201cspine-chilling.\u201d\nDuring the presidency of George W. Bush, expertise was a war cry from the left, as many liberals felt the government had abandoned science and social science. But the academy\u2019s insights aren\u2019t static or settled. Many innovative ideas \u2014 among them, some of the corrections proposed by behavioral economics \u2014 are still hypotheses. Like Sunstein, their brilliance comes with speculation, and it comes with whimsy.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between the role of an academic and the role of someone in government,\u201d Sunstein told me when we spoke at the Au Bon Pain near the White House. \u201cThat\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but in academic life if you say things that are common sense and people nod their heads, it\u2019s not very useful. You\u2019re not adding anything.\u201d One of the changes in Washington, he said, was the pace: he could no longer take off the afternoons to play tennis. It was past dinnertime, and Sunstein was headed back to the office, to his memos. \u201cWhen I was an academic, I\u2019d sometimes get a little feeling of excitement when I had an idea that was, I hoped, fresh,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd whether anyone should act on that idea is a very different question.\u201d",

    "text": "\u2018Forces of Fortune\u2019\n2010-01-22T20:11:23.000Z\nChapter 1: The Power of Commerce \nIt all happened quickly. The Muslim world changed dramatically in the short thirty-two months that separated the Ayatollah Khomeini's return to Iran on February 1, 1979, and the assassination of Anwar Sadat in Cairo on October 6, 1981. During that time of remarkable upheaval the forces of Islamic revolution seized Iran; Pakistan proclaimed itself an Islamic state; the Soviet Union touched off a jihad by invading Afghanistan; and Egyptian president Anwar Sadat was assassinated by radical fundamentalists. Since those fateful years, many more violent revolts, deadly clashes, terror attacks, and bloody suppressions have followed, along with deepening conservative Islamic attitudes and anti-Americanism across a vast swath of countries from North Africa to Southeast Asia. Extremism has come of age in this cauldron, giving rise to al-Qaeda, and its cult of violence and dark vision of the future. \nIn the face of all of this tumult, and in response to the rise of terrorism, America's most abiding objective in the Middle East since 1979 has been to contain and defeat Islamic fundamentalism. That object has determined how America sorts its allies from its adversaries, which fights it has taken on, and whether in pursuing its interests it will champion reform, promote democracy, or look to dictators and military solutions. It has also led America perilously close to reducing everything in the Middle East to the fight against fundamentalism, and to seeing every expression of Islam as a threat. The U.S. leadership has seen the fundamentalist challenge largely as a new kind of cold war. That sort of clarity can be a great help, but it can also grossly oversimplify, obscuring vital aspects of the situations within countries and regions that provide opportunities for improving relations. \nLooking at the Middle East as it is today \u2014 caught in the web of violent conflicts, seething with anger and anti-Americanism, and vulnerable to extremist ideas \u2014 it is difficult to have hope for the future. But, however difficult, that is just what we must do. In his perceptive book The Age of the Unthinkable, the strategist Joshua Cooper Ramo argues that by intensely focusing on that which is before us, we miss important trends \u2014 some barely detectable \u2014 that will shape the future. The paradigms that dominate today may matter little tomorrow. We will do ourselves a disservice if we think of our future with the Muslim world only in terms of today's conflicts. These conflicts are serious, and we must prevail in them, but we should also recognize that there are other forces at work in the Muslim world and they too deserve our attention \u2014 they may ultimately matter more to us. \nTake the case regarding the paradox of Iran, a brutish theocracy lording over a restless population that is also a rising power with ambitions to match its glorious ancient history, and a keen sense of purpose honed by decades of confrontation with the West. An examination of the ironies of Iranian power, and the fault lines within the country \u2014 on display in the recent presidential election \u2014 offer a particularly revealing starting point for rethinking the true challenges, and prospects, in transforming relations with the Muslim world. Iran's saber-rattling, and the Bush administration's hard-line stance \u2014 now being softened by the Obama administration \u2014 have diverted attention from important truths that belie the received wisdom regarding the Iranian threat, and those truths speak volumes about opportunities around the wider region. \nThe recent history of Iran's relations with the West is surely deeply troubling. Iran's revolution empowered a particularly uncompromising brand of Islam that has turned anti-Americanism into an article of faith in much of the Muslim world, and Iran's rulers have steadily supported terrorism with money, training, and weaponry. Iran also now openly seeks great-power status and is building a nuclear program. Making matters worse in recent years was the more antagonistic approach to dealing with Iran that was adopted by the Bush administration, and the badly managed prosecution of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nFor much of the past three decades, the United States and Iran were locked in a stalemate, with no diplomatic relations, but also not much in the way of direct confrontation. America was content to isolate Iran as much as possible while waiting for the clerical regime to succumb to perceived inevitable internal pressures for change. In the wake of 9/11 that approach changed. The Bush administration believed it could nudge history along. Veterans of Reagan era cold war politics \u2014 the so-called neoconservative hawks who gathered around Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld \u2014 drew confidence from what they perceived as the U.S. role in helping to toss communism onto the ash heap of history. They believed the toppling of Saddam Hussein and the rise of a reasonably stable, democratic new Iraq next door to Iran would stir Iranians into revolt and sufficiently unnerve the country's clerical rulers to provide that opening. The bitter irony was that when American troops showed up in Iraq, the grip of Iran's ruling clerics was strengthened. \nBy breaking the Taliban regime in Afghanistan in late 2001, toppling Saddam, and then uprooting Baathism in Iraq, the United States removed local rivals that had contained Iranian power to its east and west. Since the Shah's time and more so after the Islamic Revolution, Saddam's military had been the main barrier to Iran's expansionist aims. Today there is no indigenous military force in the Persian Gulf region capable of containing Iran. What's more, in the political vacuum that followed Saddam's fall, Shia Iran quickly extended its reach into the predominantly Shia lands of southern Iraq. Many of Iraq's new leaders had spent years of exile in Iran and relied on Iranian support during the dark years of Saddam's rule. It was no coincidence that Iran was the first of Iraq's neighbors to recognize its new government and to encourage Iraqis to participate in the political order established by the United States. Now Iran runs extensive intelligence and political networks that give the Islamic Republic influence at every level of Iraq's bureaucracy, clerical and tribal establishments, and security agencies \u2014 impacting election results, the flow of trade, and the tempo of violence. \nIranian leaders are keenly aware of how their regional influence has grown since 2001, and especially since 2003. Former president Muhammad Khatami, the onetime great hope of the reformers in Iran, captured this sentiment when I asked him in 2007 about how he assessed Iran's place in the region. \"Regardless of where the United States changes regimes,\" he observed, \"it is our friends who will come to power.\" True enough, Tehran has more impact on Arab politics \u2014 especially in the critical zones of Iraq, Lebanon, and Palestine \u2014 than it did ten years ago. Not only does Iran's influence in Iraq far exceed that of any Arab government, but since the war between Hezbollah and Israel in the summer of 2006, Iran has gained more say in Lebanon's domestic politics as well \u2014 pushing for Hezbollah's interests and constricting politicians favored by the United States or Iran's Arab rivals. The clerical regime has also kept up, if not jacked up, its meddling in Palestinian politics through its support for the extremists of Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas, as well as cultivating ties with Syria. By excoriating Israel and taking advantage of Arab frustration with the lack of progress in the peace process, Iran seems to curry more favor these days on the Arab street than the tired old Arab dictatorships in charge. So it is that Iran's Supreme Leader confidently boasted that no problem can be solved in the Middle East without Iran's consent and help. \nIran's hubris was fueled by soaring oil prices in 2007 and the first three quarters of 2008, which eventually topped out at close to $150 a barrel. Flush with petrodollars, Iran's rulers were confident they could afford their shopping spree for influence in the Palestinian Territories, Lebanon, and Iraq by supplying their allies and clients with funds, weapons \u2014 including rockets and missiles \u2014 and training. There is worry across the Middle East that all this activity will only increase if Iran goes nuclear. Then Tehran will have little fear of reprisal for its boldly aggressive policies, which is one reason why a host of Arab nations now contemplate nuclear programs of their own to temper Iran's surging influence. \nTalk of military action against Iran was rife in the Bush administration throughout 2007 and 2008, but the United States had too much on its plate in Iraq and Afghanistan, not to mention the deepening political crisis in Pakistan, to take any such step. All of this seems to indicate that Iran has become a juggernaut. But as the recent upheaval shows, the reality is more complex. \nFor the West, the most often used measure of Iran's regional influence is the flow of arms and influence from Tehran to its allies and clients. In order to gauge how much weight Iran is throwing around, America looks to metrics such as those above about the dollar amount Tehran promises Hamas, the volume of weapons it smuggles to Hezbollah, and the numbers of those trained in terrorist tactics by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' shadowy Quds Brigade. There is plenty of this activity to alarm America and its Arab allies, and worse, those ties are becoming stronger. If Iran goes nuclear there is no telling what havoc might be wreaked by means of Iran's minions. There is no denying, then, that Iran's hard power and influence have been growing. But viewing Iranian power from that angle alone makes it look more inevitable and ominous than it really is. \nEconomics has more to do with determining the pecking order in the Middle East than the region's miasmic tumult of feuds, wars, and saber rattlings would lead one to believe. The Middle East is not just a zone of clashing extremist ideas and zealous terrorist armies. It is also a place of struggling and thriving economies, where new classes and business elites are elbowing their way higher in the power structures of many countries, changing religious, social, and political life on the way. Other contenders for great-power status in recent memory, Brazil, China, or India, all rose to prominence not on the back of hard power but as economic stars driving growth in the regions around them. That is not the case with Iran. Iran is not going the way of the so-called BRICs (to use the somewhat misleading acronym that lumps petro-dependent Russia in with the more diversified economies of Brazil, India, and China). Iran's economy is the 151st most isolated in the world (that is out of 160) and sixteenth most isolated in the Middle East (out of seventeen). Iran's drive for regional power lacks an economic underpinning. And that makes gauging Iran's regional power a tricky business. Hard power is not its most effective means to greater influence. \nIran has most influence where it does most trade; where that influence is backed by economic and business relations. While Iran has deep ties to Lebanon's Hezbollah and a long-running alliance with Syria, its most certain sphere of influence is far closer to home, in an arc that runs from Central Asia in the north and east down through western Afghanistan and on into the Persian Gulf and southern Iraq to the south and west. \"When you go to Central Asia these days\" remarks The Atlantic Monthly's Robert Kaplan, \"you feel you are in greater Iran.\" It is in this arc where Iran does most of its regional business, selling agricultural products, electricity (a big-ticket item in this air-conditioning-hungry region), natural gas, and even manufactured goods. \nThe trade between Iran and the five Central Asian 'stans was worth well over $1 billion in 2008 (up from $580 million in 2001). The Iranian rial changes hands there as easily as local currencies. Counting the unaccounted for cross-border trade, Iran does about the same amount of business with Afghanistan (up astronomically from a paltry $52 million in 2001). Trade with Iraq topped $4 billion in 2008 and with the United Arab Emirates reached $14 billion \u2014 a figure that does not include all the black-market trading that goes on across the Gulf. In fact, Iran has such a vital interest in this trade that the regime has created banking and financial ties and invested infrastructure projects in these countries ranging from roads, railways, and piers to pipelines andelectricity pylons. Businesses of all kinds have grown in these countries on the back of this trade. \nIn so many ways, Iran is well qualified to become a true economic powerhouse driving wider growth in the region. Its nearly 70 million people give it a population about the same size as Turkey's. It has vast oil and gas reserves, plus a strong industrial base by regional standards. Labor is cheap but the literacy rate is high, over 75 percent. As the country's thriving art scene and internationally acclaimed movie industry suggest, Iranians are also far better plugged into world culture than is the norm in the region. \nIranians are Web- and mobile-savvy (Persian is the world's third most widely used language online, the country boasts the most bloggers per capita anywhere in the world, and almost two-thirds of the country \u2014 some 48 million people \u2014 are mobile phone users). They are also technically adept: The country's leading technical school, Sharif University of Science and Technology in Tehran, turns out world-class engineers and scientists. Stanford regularly admits Sharif alumni into its graduate programs in engineering, and according to one Stanford professor and former department chair, \"Sharif now has one of the best undergraduate electrical-engineering programs in the world.\" \nThis sort of human-capital development can make Iran a player in the competitive global economy. The degree of ingenuity and skill already present is attested to, ironically, by the nuclear program, which is run by homegrown experts. Iran's rulers even like to claim \u2014 despite great skepticism in most Western quarters \u2014 that the nuclear drive and rocket program will be Iran's ticket to economic globalization's cutting edge. And it is not just splitting atoms that is supposed to catapult Iran into global status, the country is also investing in space research and biotechnology. Research outfit Iran Cord Blood Bank, created in 2003 with the Supreme Leader's blessing, has committed $2.5 billion to human embryonic stem cell research to help cure a range of ailments from heart disease to multiple sclerosis. The initiative has surged ahead taking advantage of the fact that a fetus is not considered a human in Islamic law before the end of the first trimester of a pregnancy. \nIn a more down-to-earth vein, Tehran mayor and former Revolutionary Guards commander Muhammad Baqer Qalibaf talks of development in terms of economic reform, private sector growth, and globalization. When he ran for president in 2005, he fashioned himself as the Islamic Republic's version of the maverick state-builder and founder of the Pahlavi monarchy, Reza Shah, turning heads with his colorful feel-good campaign posters that promised growth and prosperity. The same themes crop up routinely in Qalibaf 's speeches and interviews as the can-do mayor of Tehran. \nSuch hopeful talk from the higher-ups falls flat, though, before the reality of an Iran where inflation is running at double digits and about a quarter of the workforce is jobless. The problem is not a lack of enterprise or fundamental potential. Iran has a dynamic private sector and the middle class to go with it. The economist Djavad Saleh-Isfahani estimates that around half of Iran's population of 70 million is middle class or above \u2014 counting their possessions, disposable income, level of education, and family size \u2014 with the kind of social attitudes that are needed to support robust consumption habits and modernizing change. The problem is that Iran's private sector is shackled by a corrupt and inefficient state that dominates 80 percent of the economy. The state grew to its current size after the revolution by devouring large parts of the private sector \u2014 nationalizing businesses, banks, and industries. It prioritizes spending on the poor above achieving economic growth, and therefore sees no problem in stifling entrepreneurship with red tape, starving businesses of resources, and taxing them dry. It is top-down centralized economic management at its worst. \nWhen it comes to the economy, Iran is not a regional leader but a regional laggard, dawdling in the soggy bottomlands of suffocating statism. This economic stagnation was a powerful driver of the vehement opposition to Ahmadinejad in the recent election. The thing to watch in Iran over the next few years is the private sector and the middle class tied to it \u2014 the same class that in the aftermath of the June 2009 election led millions to ask \"where is my vote?\" The great battle for the soul of Iran \u2014 and for the soul of the region as a whole \u2014 will be fought not over religion but over business and capitalism. At issue will be whether the state will free the economy and let this dynamic society reach its full potential. \nThe deeper truth about Iran's power is that playing the anti-American and pro-Palestinian cards is not going to bring Iran lasting influence. As a senior Iranian official once told me, \"When push comes to shove, the Palestinians will be the first to turn on Iran.\" Iran will not be able to truly dominate the region if it does not do a better job of developing its economic clout. Great-power status presupposes economic leadership, and that Iran is not currently providing. This is the key to Iran's quest for nuclear capability; the Iranian rulers think they need the threat of nuclear aggression or retaliation in order to forestall Western pressure for regime change and to intimidate neighbors, but even more important to punch above their weight. After all, Iran's GDP is about the same as that of Massachusetts. It spends only $6 billion a year on its military. That is less than a third of Saudi Arabia's military expenditure of $21 billion a year, and close to half of Turkey or Israel's annual military spending. Before the revolution, Iran's military expenditure was as high as 18 percent of GDP; today it is a paltry 3 percent. How can a country with an economy the size of Massachusetts and the lowest military expenditure in its neighborhood take on the United States and claim great-power status? The answer in Tehran is that only nuclear capability will address Iran's glaring economic and military deficits. And if Iranians had any doubts that nuclear capability will raise their stock, America's near obsession with the issue over the past six years has convinced them. \nBut even with nuclear capability, the kind of status that Iran covets will elude it. Both India and Pakistan started down the nuclear path in the 1970s, but only one of them emerged as a regional great power in the 1990s. It was not nukes that turned India into a rising power, but rather its economic growth rate, newfound friendliness to free markets, and ability to integrate into the global economy. Iran today rallies the alienated and rouses the dispossessed, but those seeking progress and prosperity have to look elsewhere for inspiration. If Iran wants to be a great power, it will have to further nurture its economy so that it serves as the engine of growth for the region that it could be. That would mean bringing itself into concert with a vital economic transformation underway all around the region \u2014 the rise of a new middle class that is the key to more fully integrating the Middle East into the global economy, and to the building of better relations with the West. It is to this rise of a new middle class that leaders in the United States and around the West should turn attention \u2014 to fuel its potential \u2014 rather than allowing the chimerical power of fundamentalism to dictate so much of the approach to the region. \nThe great irony of the fundamentalist threat is that the two years from 1979 to 1981 in which Islamic fundamentalism shook the world and terrified the West were also its high point of power. That is not to say, of course, that after fundamentalism won Iran, turned Pakistan, and destabilized Egypt it just died out; fundamentalists are too vocal, active, well organized, and well funded for that. Fundamentalism most definitely remains a worry, and its extremist edge a serious threat. Extremism that has been festering in the innards of Pakistan's society is surging, laying claim to vast swaths of its territory, and those extremist forces are waging a two-pronged war against not only foreign troops but the governments of both Afghanistan and Pakistan. The thought of nuclear-armed Pakistan, with its 175-million-plus population \u2014 deeply divided along ethnic lines, and with a troubled economy and weak government \u2014 unraveling before the extremist onslaught is unnerving to say the least. A failed Pakistan in the clutches of extremism or plunged into civil war, and with no safeguards locking down its nuclear arsenal, would be deeply destabilizing for the region and the world. \nThe larger truth about fundamentalism's drive to power, though, is that since 1980 it has toppled no more dominoes. The Taliban visited horror on Afghanistan, but this rag-tag army of religious zealots and tribal warriors amounted to no more than an incomplete insurgency in a broken corner of the Muslim world \u2014 an antique badland even before decades of war ravaged it. There have been no additional Irans, and the prospect that another Islamic state will arise \u2014 whether through peaceful means or violent ones \u2014 has been steadily declining. \nThe West must remain vigilant against fundamentalism, but that should not stop Western policymakers and publics from seeing the \"whole picture\" in the Middle East, and a vital truth of the region is that the fundamentalist strain of Islam is not practiced by the vast majority of the population, and is not on the rise. What is true is that since 1980, a broader wave of Islamic resurgence has swept across the Middle East, and fundamentalism has surfed that wave rather than fueling it. The Islamic resurgence is much larger, deeper, and more complex. The vast majority of Muslims are moderate and pragmatic when it comes to religion, balancing law and piety with a healthy dose of mystical practices and folk religion. \nIt is not fundamentalism that accounts for the ubiquity of Islamic influence across the region today; rather it is the other way around: Widespread Islamic fervor \u2014 which can, but does not have to, take on a fundamentalist form \u2014 has allowed fundamentalism to survive past its prime. It would of course be foolish to ignore fundamentalism and the extremists associated with it, but it is also imprudent to consider fundamentalism the end-all and be-all of what we need to know about Islam and the Middle East. It is time that we take a good look at the vitality of the energetic blending of Islamic piety and capitalist fervor that is flourishing in many pockets around the region. \n\u2014- \nIn November 2006, when Pope Benedict XVI visited Turkey, he made a stop at the seventeenth-century Blue Mosque, so called for the more than twenty thousand handcrafted cobalt-blue Iznik tiles that adorn its interior. A testament to Ottoman grandeur, the great mosque is an architectural marvel of unrivaled beauty. At one point, the gently strolling pontiff stopped and looked up at a large black tableau with ornate white calligraphy, etched into an arch at the mosque's main exit, and asked his guide what the flowing script said. They were the words of the Prophet, he was told: \"A merchant is the beloved of God\" (al-kasib habiballah). \nBenedict's visit to Turkey was historic, his first to a Muslim country. It was also a hastily organized damage-control mission. Two months earlier, His Holiness had caused a furor when, in a speech in his German homeland, he had evoked the criticisms of Islam made by fourteenth-century Byzantine emperor Manuel II Paleologus, who led the empire during its last days, as the Ottoman Turks steadily encroached on its power, eventually seizing Constantinople. Manuel had written a \"Refutation of Islam,\" in which he argued that Islam was an irrational religion, an evil falsehood that had been spread by the sword. Making the reference worse was the fact that Manuel, in his desperate efforts to obtain support for the fight against the Turks, had made an alliance with the pope in Rome. By quoting Manuel, the current pope seemed to be saying that Islam was essentially driven by jihad and was at odds with Western values \u2014 not only Christian values, but those of modernity altogether. \nHow ironic, then, that on that day at the Blue Mosque, the pope discovered that for centuries, the last words worshippers read when leaving the mosque were a call to commerce. Not only was commerce important to the seventeenth-century Muslim world, it is even more important to that world today. Washington is certainly not entirely unaware of this. The United States has been supporting economic reform and business initiatives in the Muslim world, but with too much focus on working with government planners and the top-level business elite. Change will not come from this upper crust \u2014 it has too much invested in the status quo and depends too heavily on the state. It is business with small \"b\" that should hold our attention. \nAll across the region, a whole new economy is rising, mixing local values with surging consumption and building ever richer ties to the global economy, and this trend is not only every bit as powerful and important as the threat of fundamentalism, it is more so. \nIn the spring of 2009, I met in Dubai with a group of Middle Eastern businessmen. Only a short time earlier, the little emirate had been swept to dizzying heights of wealth and prosperity, and these businessmen had done quite well for themselves. Now the discussion was more somber, focused not surprisingly on the global financial crisis. After much talk about failing banks and falling real estate prices, I asked the group how they were responding. \n\"Money is flying to Beirut,\" one of them explained. \"Everyone is putting what they can in Lebanese banks.\" \nLebanese banks? \nWhy were these very savvy businessmen prepared to trust their substantial assets and investments to banks in a country with a reputation for war and instability \u2014 the Hezbollah-land that so worries the West? Were they making a political statement with their money, sending a further message to the West about their willingness to support their cause even in a time of financial trouble? Or was I missing their point altogether? \n\"Why Lebanon?\" I finally asked sheepishly. \n\"Well, the interest rate is much higher in Lebanon than here,\" one answered, while another pointed out what was already obvious to the rest of the group: \"Lebanese banks sit outside the global financial system. They have no toxic assets to worry about. Nor are they threatened with collapse or government takeover, as are banks in New York and London.\" \nWhy had I needed to be reminded that capitalism is alive and thriving in the Middle East? There are signs of it everywhere, from the actions of these businessmen to protect their assets to the staggering rate at which shopping malls and modern retail establishments of all kinds have gone up in the Muslim world, and not just in Kuala Lumpur or Dubai, where one sees extravagant Rodeo Drive-style malls. In war-torn Beirut and fundamentalist-dominated Tehran, glitzy malls are filled on holidays with shoppers eager to buy the latest electronics or fashionable home furnishings. \nThis capitalist flowering has had clearly definable cultural ramifications as well. A quick glance at rooftops in any Arab city will leave little room for doubt that satellite television has mesmerized the Arab world, to the chagrin of its dictators and their censors. There are some 280 channels to choose from, and the more popular ones, such as al-Jazeera or al-Arabiya, claim viewership in the tens of millions. It is also on these airwaves that some of the most interesting religious debates take place. Clerics are not the only ones who draw the big audiences. They must now compete with a new breed of televangelists, who preach modernity- and business-friendly Islam. \nInternet use too is steadily growing. About 40 percent of Iran's population surfs the Web, with the ranks of first-timers swelling constantly, as opinion and information flow briskly into and out of social networking websites and chat rooms, and then get further interpreted on blogs. Even clerics maintain active websites, blogs, and Facebook pages, and have Twitter followings. Those two social networking sites took over the presidential campaign of 2009, upending traditional media to make way for new political dynamics in the country. The government has tried its hand at restricting and censoring the Net, but it is King Canute ordering back the tide. And even if the hard-line ayatollahs and their minions could strangle the Internet, what would they do about the explosion of cell phones and mobile texting? In 2000, fewer than a million Iranians had a cell phone. Now some 48 million \u2014 about two-thirds of the country \u2014 have one. Even people too poor to obtain a regular mobile subscription can buy cheap prepaid phones to start talking and texting. And it is not just Iran: Next door in war-ravaged Afghanistan, the close of 2008 found eight million mobile phones in use \u2014 about one quarter of the population. Pakistan's numbers are even more impressive; in 2008, 78 million were using mobile phones; up from a mere 750,000 in 2001. \nA vital characteristic of this flourishing capitalism is that it goes so much hand in hand with the resurgence of traditional Islamic belief. All over the Middle East, piety is shaping consumption. Those who live by Islam also demand Islamic goods; not just halal food and headscarves, but Islamic housing, haute couture, banking, education, entertainment, media, consumer goods (such as Europe-based alternatives to Coke and Pepsi, Mecca Cola and Qibla Cola), and even vacations \u2014 Islamic cruises are a growth industry in Turkey, and the governor of Najaf in southern Iraq has been thinking of ways to market pilgrimage vacation packages in order to coax some of the million-plus Iranians who visit the sacred sites in his city every year into staying longer and spending more. Some offerings mix the taste for Islam with that for globalization, as, for example, The Caprice, a luxury hotel with a distinctly French name that caters to the Islamically conscious vacationing on Turkey's western coast. \nThis upwardly mobile class consumes Islam as much as practicing it, demanding the same sorts of life-enhancing goods and services as middle classes everywhere. Their preference that those goods have an Islamic flavor makes Islam big business. A booming economic sector around the region is catering to this exploding demand, and these rising Islamic consumers comprise as much as a sixth of humanity, spread across a vast expanse from Morocco to Malaysia, with notable toeholds from Detroit to D\u00fcsseldorf and S\u00e3o Paulo to Singapore. \nAmericans are easily dazzled by the size of China's economy, the speed of its growth, and the room it has to expand. In recent years, India's economy has also made remarkable strides. Thinking of the notional \"Muslim-world economy\" provides an interesting basis for comparison. The global Muslim population of a billion-plus is about the same size as both India and China's populations. In 2008 the GDP of the economies of five of the largest countries in and around the Middle East \u2014 Egypt, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, with a combined population of 420 million \u2014 was $3.3 trillion, the same size as that of India, which has three times the population. \nThe bottom line is: A billion consumers have clout. Across economies as diverse as those of Mali, Dubai, and Indonesia \u2014 and outside the Muslim-majority countries, in the Muslim diasporas \u2014 the demand for Islamic goods and services is strong and growing, and it has already created waves in global markets. This is perhaps best demonstrated by the boom in Islamic finance, which is doing good work in further integrating the economies of the Muslim world and the global economy. \n\u2014- \nFor Americans, seeing the words \"Islamic\" and \"finance\" in the same sentence tends to conjure up worries about terrorism. The need to identify and cut off terrorists' money flows is entirely legitimate, but \"Islamic finance\" has nothing to do with funding extremism or violence; rather the term refers to banking and other financial services \u2014 such as insurance, mutual funds, equities, bonds, credit cards, and even derivatives \u2014 that are compatible with shariah rules and regulations. Shariah requires neither collecting nor paying interest on bank deposits or loans, and in the case of bonds, limiting the amount of debt a company takes on in issuing bonds to the value of assets on its books. Islamic finance also means avoiding investment in ventures that may violate the shariah, such as businesses that serve alcohol, involve gambling, produce devices that can promote immorality, or in some cases, even the use of mannequins or bareheaded women in advertising. \nIn place of charging interest, Islamic finance relies on forming partnerships that demand that borrowers, lenders, and investors jointly take an equity position in business ventures, sharing in the risk and reward of those investments. The whole thing works better in theory than in practice, and Islamic financiers have had to develop entrepreneurial ways of working around these restrictions to make the system work. For instance, car dealerships will simply add the amount they would make in interest for a loan to the cost of a car, and offer buyers a deferred payment schedule. \nAlthough Islamic finance remains a fledgling, niche market in the vast global financial-services industry, it has lately been growing at the rate of 15 to 20 percent per year. The American consulting firm McKinsey & Co. estimates that by 2010, assets held by Islamic financial houses will total $1 trillion, a fivefold growth in five years. The Western ratings agency Standard and Poor estimates that these assets could ultimately grow to as much as $4 trillion. The 2008 global financial crisis may in fact give a good boost to these numbers as more Muslims may decide to pull their money from traditional investments for the perceived security of the Islamic alternative. \nThere are some three hundred Islamic banks and investment firms operating in more than seventy-five countries. By the end of 2006, some 218 shariah-compliant mutual funds were managing an estimated $14 billion. Iran accounts for the most shariah-compliant assets ($155 billion in 2007), followed by Saudi Arabia and Malaysia ($69 and $65 billion each) and then Kuwait and U.A.E. ($38 and $35 billion each). These banks oversee banking services totaling close to $500 billion and an Islamic bond market worth $82 billion \u2014 a mere one-tenth of one percent of the global bond market, but expanding fast. The total investment in these bonds grew by an eye-popping 250 percent in 2006, and growth continued even with the global financial downturn. \nThree large Middle Eastern players dominate Islamic finance: the Faysal Group, al-Baraka, and the Kuwait Finance House. The most active hub for Islamic finance has for many years been Kuala Lumpur \u2014 where Southeast Asia's boom in the 1990s charted the way for the integration of Muslim Malaysia and Indonesia into the global economy \u2014 but Dubai and Bahrain now account for a growing share of the market. All of them now warily anticipate competition from the larger financial centers of London, Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Singapore. \nAs an indication of how this form of financing can serve to build ties between the Middle East and global economy, many global financial brands such as HSBC, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Citigroup, and the UK's Black Rock are getting into the game. They are targeting a growing market of Muslims in the West for retail banking as well as more lucrative upscale financial services, such as private banking and wealth management, and looking to gain growing shares of the booming Islamic-bond market. Deutsche Bank, Barclays Capital, and BNP Paribas are now among the world's top five issuers of Islamic bonds. The equity markets in the West are also joining in. Dow Jones has indexes for both Islamic bonds and Islamic investment funds. Research and analysis into Islamic finance is also going on at Moody's and Reuters, and the premier annual gathering of experts on the subject takes place at Harvard University's Forum on Islamic Finance. \nLondon in particular has set its sights on becoming a major center for Islamic finance. The city saw its first Islamic bank open in 2004, and since then two more have opened and a fourth is on the way. The London stock market issued its first Islamic bond in 2007, and is well on its way to expanding into the sovereign Islamic-bond market. Competition is spurring legal reform and the creation of new regulatory mechanisms designed to encourage Islamic financial activity. So far that competition has favored Dubai, whose relatively hands-off regulatory environment is the most attractive to investors and borrowers, but there is no denying that increasingly Islamic finance is going global. \nArab Islamic banks are setting up shop in Europe and Southeast Asia, and European and Southeast Asian banks are providing Islamic banking in the Persian Gulf. Banks such as Saudi Arabia's al-Rajhi or Kuwait Financial House have been building branches across the Muslim world and competing with local Islamic banks such as the Dubai Islamic Bank or the Islamic Bank of Jordan, or the Islamic arm of local mainstream banks or global financial outfits like HSBC or Citigroup. Smaller markets are converging into one global market ruled by the same regulations and standards, which mix Western business practices with Islamic ones, all enforced by Islamic scholars and shariah-compliance boards. Malaysia has tried to enforce standards by creating the National Shariah Board, and there is a broader international effort aimed at creating common standards is in the works at Bahrain's Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions. \nIslamic scholars on lucrative retainers with financial institutions, some in America, help design new Islamic financial products \u2014 and even help bend the rules to sell finance to shariah-conscious customers. One particularly influential one is Yusuf DeLorenzo, an American convert from Brooklyn. In addition to advising twenty global financial institutions and a few Muslim countries, the dapper sheikh is the chief shariah officer (rhymes with chief financial officer) at Shariah Capital, a Connecticut-based Islamic hedge fund. Meanwhile, many of these customers come from Turkey, Indonesia, and North Africa, where the religiously conscious middle class is growing. \nWhen in 2006 the Dubai Port Authority acquired British Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation (which managed a number of U.S. ports), some in the United States pointed to the $3.5 billion Islamic bond that had financed the deal as proof of a threat to U.S. security. Islamic bonds were then unknown to most Americans, and the mere mention of Islam with relation to financing was enough to ring alarm bells. Yet a number of American companies had already dipped their toes into these waters. In 2004, the Texas-based oil group East Cameron Partners became the first American company to issue Islamic bonds. Recently, Ford Motor Company's $848 million sale of Aston-Martin to the Kuwait-based Islamic bank Investment Dar required Islamic financing. Caribou Coffee, America's largest specialty coffee chain after Starbucks, is owned by a shariah-compliant private-equity firm based in Bahrain. In Europe, British developers have financed the multibillion-dollar purchase of London's historic Chelsea Barracks complex with Islamic bonds, while in 2004, the German provincial government of Saxony-Anhalt became the first non-Muslim sovereign entity to do so, raising 100 million Euros in the process. France, China, Japan, and Thailand are all poised to follow. \nKey to understanding the growth of Islamic finance, and the insight it offers into the up-and-coming mind-set of so many Muslims, is that it evolved due to the demands of average customers. Some observers ascribe the spectacular growth of the last few years to the oil boom, and the flow back to the region of an estimated $800 billion belonging to Muslims made nervous by post-9/11 financial regulations intended to clamp down on the laundering of money to fund terrorism. Surely those cash flows have greatly accelerated growth, but consider that this money that had been stashed away in America, Britain, or Switzerland before 9/11 could, when it \"came home,\" just as easily have gone into regular banks and investment funds in the Middle East, which are plentiful. The directing of so much money into Islamic finance suggests a strong specific demand for this brand of the blending of capitalism and Islam. \nIndeed shariah compliance has attracted many Muslims to investing who had previously shunned formal markets. One can think of Islamic finance in its early days as somewhat akin to microfinance, meaning the provision of small loans to those shunned by traditional bankers because of low income and little or no collateral to offer. When Bangladesh's Grameen Bank pioneered the idea, the intent was not so much to make profits but to lift people out of poverty. But over the past decade, microfinance has evolved into big business, with large banks and investment funds competing over what the business strategist C. K. Prahalad calls \"the fortune at the bottom of the pyramid.\" \nLike microcredit, Islamic finance was a response to a moral imperative: to fulfill a demand for loans by those who wanted their business to be in compliance with the shariah. The largest Islamic financial institution, Saudi Arabia's al-Rajhi Bank, started operations as a small firm providing the interest-free equivalent of modest loans, and it grew largely by bringing in new, piously interest-averse investors. Whereas in 1978, savings accounted for only 10 percent of all deposits in Saudi Arabia, thanks to Islamic banking, that number had grown to 53 percent by 2007. In 2008 the three Islamic banks in the kingdom accounted for 45 percent of all bank-credit facilities, and al-Rajhi now has more branches \u2014 many located away from major cities \u2014 than any other bank in the kingdom, boasting an impressive $15 billion in deposits. So popular was the opportunity to bank in this fashion that when Kuwait Finance House, now one of the world's largest Islamic banks and the holder of its country's largest single deposit pool, opened its doors, it attracted so many customers that it met the deposit goal for its whole first year within thirty days. \nThere is no question that Islamic finance is now benefiting from an advantage in attracting deposits and investments from the growing wealth at the top of society, and in the government, in prospering Southeast Asia and the oil-rich Persian Gulf. Financiers in the West know very well about the kind of wealth that floats around at the top levels of these societies, especially the huge reserves of cash in government coffers and sovereign wealth funds \u2014 investment funds run by the government, with government money. But the growing ranks of newly cash rich individuals in the Muslim world, who come not from the traditional elite but from the rising classes, are strong consumers of Islamic finance too. \nTheir counterparts in Europe and the United States are also fans. Accenture, a global consulting company, estimates that demand among Muslims in Europe will drive the next phase of the growth. Half of all Muslim middle-class savings in the world belong to Muslims who live in the West. American Muslims are more likely than their coreligionists in Europe or the Muslim-majority countries to enjoy middle-class status. According to Zogby polls, a majority of U.S. Muslims are educated and earn more than $50,000 a year. Pent-up demand among middle-class American Muslims has already made Islamic finance an instant success in Chicago. No sooner had that city's Devon Bank begun looking into the feasibility of Islamic banking in 2002 than local Muslims came to it in droves looking for shariah-compliant home mortgages and car loans. Islamic finance will likely soon be as ubiquitous in the West as in the Muslim world, and if Islamic finance's market share were to reflect the Muslim's 20 percent share of world population, then shariah-compliant finance will be growing at a spectacular pace for some time. \nIslamic finance is also attractive to many women who generate, own, inherit, or manage wealth, but who find themselves inhibited by law or custom from dealing with the mixed-sex environment of regular financial institutions. \"Ladies only\" banks have been a growth industry. Coutts, a private bank based in London, has been doing a brisk business in private banking services for wealthy Persian Gulf female residents. The air of propriety surrounding shariah-compliant finance is attractive to women. There are fewer stigmas associated with walking into an Islamic bank or investing through Islamic investment arms without male supervision. To cater to this growing market, Islamic banks have been educating women in finance. The Kuwait Finance House, for example, holds classes for women. Islamic finance firms are also hiring more women than do regular banks. A third of financial-sector employees in Bahrain and two-fifths of those in Kuwait, for example, are women. \nAll of this is not to say that Islamic finance will in any way become dominant in the global economy, not by a very long shot. Limitations will rein in the growth of this business. Islam's ban on speculation, for example, means that transactions must be based on tangible assets, which makes it easy to do business in commodities and real estate, but much trickier to innovate financial products. Islamic finance could run out of assets to sustain its growth, and even short of that it may overemphasize investment in certain assets, such as real estate or retail, thereby increasing the risk of losses. The business may also suffer from squabbles over just what is properly Islamic. The Islamic bond market took a tumble \u2014 and along with it the value of properties funded by Islamic bonds \u2014 when in 2008 a group of clerics in Bahrain declared that most Islamic bonds are not Islamic because they fail to shift the ownership of collateral to bond holders. Without that transfer, they argued, a financial transaction isn't based on tangible assets and is therefore not Islamic. \nThe cost of that religious ruling was high and the evidence that clericscan send the market tumbling was disconcerting to many investors. The question is also open whether Islamic finance can keep growing by tap-dancing around the matter of interest rates. Profit-sharing instruments, or other work-arounds such as providing indirect car loans, are relatively inefficient, incurring higher costs in putting deals together. Islamic finance will need more innovation of clever strategies if it is to continue to grow market share by comparison to traditional finance. A great deal of money is being poured into research and development of schemes, but it's hard to know whether those efforts will yield results. \nGiven ample demand and all the windfall oil cash sluicing around the Middle East, Islamic finance will likely continue to ride high despite its inefficiencies, but it will eventually hit a glass ceiling. Nonetheless it has already become a notable part of global financial trade, and most important for our purposes here, it will serve as a vehicle for integrating the Muslim economy ever more into the world economy. \nAll this emphasis on morals in finance may not seem economically rational, but taking stock of the global financial crisis of 2008, there is something to be said for ethics in finance. Islamic financiers now brag that their ethics steered them away from the risky ventures that have caused so much havoc, and will make them more attractive to investors going forward. Indonesia's President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono recently told a gathering of Islamic bankers in Jakarta that they must educate the West in the merits of their enterprise. \nThe reason, though, that all of this economic vitality around the blending of Islam and capitalism is so important for the West to take note of is that it reveals so much about the nature of the new middle class that is driving this growth, and is in turn growing ever larger and more influential. Some members of this new middle class are the children of the old haute bourgeoisie, their families tied to large, venerable industries and the type of state patronage that the West is familiar with. But a far larger percentage \u2014 and here is the key \u2014 comes from the provincial and lower social classes. These sons and daughters of the poor and the provinces who have made the jump to the middle class have done so by accepting the requirements of modern economies and latching on to the economic realities that define modernism. They have embraced the rules of the market, responding to its incentives, and are guided in their decisions by the desire to serve their economic interests. So energetic is their commitment to the capitalist credo that their activities now account for most of the real economic growth in the region. The consumerism of the general population is largely the result of their handiwork. Ambitious and resourceful, they fill the ranks of the professionals, the entrepreneurs, the corporate businessmen, and the traders. It is they who have established for the next generation a new economic model of the good life here on Earth. \nThe interests that this economy is creating, and the ties with the global community that it is forging, offer ample opportunities for engaging this \"critical middle\" that has come to be the center of gravity in one Muslim-majority society after another. In coming years, that middle is only going to get bigger, and richer: In 2007, GDP grew at an annual rate of around 6.1 percent in the Muslim countries of Southeast Asia (Indonesia and Malaysia) and the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf rim (followed by robust but slightly lower rates in Egypt, Pakistan, and Turkey). Europe and the United States, by comparison, grew at around 2.2 percent that year. In 1970, only 4 percent of the professionals in Malaysia were Muslim; today, that figure is closer to 40 percent. Since 1970, Malaysia has emerged as a success story of globalization, one of the largest exporters of electronic goods to the United States and an integral part of the global supply chain for the computer and electronics industries. Globalization and rising middle classes with big wallets \u2014 and a continuing interest in living as observant Muslims \u2014 have gone hand in hand. \nThe crucial aspect of this \"critical middle\" that is difficult for those in the West to grasp is that for this population, Islam is a powerful supporter of the drive to modernity. The great majority of Muslims think that Islam improves their lives. They want heaven later, and wealth in the meantime \u2014 and think that handling the latter well can help lead to the former. As Pope Benedict learned at the Blue Mosque, Islamic piety is not only about things that the West fears; it is also about things that the West appreciates. This distinctive blending of Islamic values and economic vitality is a crucial development in the Muslim world that should shape our approach to building better relations with the region. \nWill the Muslim businessmen of the coming century lead a capitalist revolution much as Protestant burghers did in Holland four centuries ago? We do not know yet, but it is possible. The mayor of the booming town of Kayseri in central Turkey, where many of the so-called Islamically conscious \"Anatolian Tigers\" come from, thinks so. \"I had read Weber,\" he says, referring to the German sociologist who first credited Calvinist ethic for the rise of capitalism. The idea of \"how Calvinists work hard, save money and then reinvest it into business\" seems, he continued, \"very similar to what was happening in Kayseri.\" Reflecting on the words of the Prophet hanging in the Blue Mosque, the mayor of Hacilar, a deeply religious little boom town not too far from Kayseri, explained the business activity around him saying \"opening a factory in Islam is a sort of prayer.\" If there is going to be genuine capitalism in the Middle East, in the broad sense of the term as experienced by the West \u2014 where individuals working through markets account for growth and prosperity \u2014 it will come from these pious businessmen and not from state-led initiatives and the state-sponsored economic elites associated with them who have for much too long ruled the Middle Eastern economies. \nIf European history is any guide only this robust breed of capitalism will bring true modernizing change to the Muslim world. The modern world was invented by children of the Reformation, but it was not their puritanical and intolerant faith that transformed the world \u2014 far from it \u2014 but rather trade and commerce that took hold in unlikely backward corners of Europe like Scotland, home to the early Industrial Revolution and the likes of Adam Smith, David Hume, and Sir Walter Scott. \nIf the Middle East is to be properly integrated into the global economy, turn to democracy, give women their rights, embrace values that transcend cultural divides, and keep extremism at bay, then it too will have to be transformed by the capitalist revolution. The most decisive battle for the future in the region will not be the one over religion \u2014 in which, as we shall see, the tide has already turned against extremism. Nor will it be the growing battle over political rights, as hopeful as that is. The key struggle that will pave the way for the decisive defeat of extremism and to social liberalization will be the battle to free the markets. If that battle is won by private-sector business leaders and the rising middle class tied to them, then progress with political rights will follow. \nEven in Iran, the potential for opening, and an economically led entry into the world community, is strong. As the election protests vividly revealed Iran has a dynamic civil society. Women's right activists, students, labor unionists, journalists, bloggers, artists, and intellectuals have made up the backbone of the struggle for reform and continue valiantly to resist oppression, bad laws, and arbitrary rule, and their voices could be heard loudly and clearly during the election. During the presidency of the reformist Muhammad Khatami between 1997 and 2005, they seemed to hold the promise of being able to liberate Iran from theocratic oppression and set it on course for true democracy. That campaign and the effort to elect the reform candidate Hossein Moussavi faltered, for reasons that we will explore further later, but those who launched those movements are still around, and they still believe in freedom. The civil society that they represent grew in tandem with the private sector, relying on its economic health to energize demands for rights. For that energy to nudge Iran decisively in the direction of change and openness, private-sector dynamism must be reignited. \nWhen China opened to the world, human rights and political reform were hardly the goals Communist leaders had in mind. In fact, booming China all too often seemed to feel that its success made it free to ignore outside pressures to yield to its dissidents, change its laws, or move in the direction of pluralism and democracy. Whatever change came to China in the form of gradual legal reform and greater civil society activism owed much to pressure from investors and traders. Deepening ties with global business forced China to change many laws and practices \u2014 to adopt what the American geostrategic writer Thomas P. M. Barnett calls the transparent modern \"rule sets\" of the world's developed and well-integrated \"core.\" None of the changes that China grudgingly made \u2014 often in response to embarrassing crises like scares over the SARS virus and tainted toothpaste and pet-food exports \u2014 was explicitly political in nature. Yet they represented significant progress nonetheless. \nA legal system and bureaucracy forced to change in one area becomes more receptive to change in other areas as well. Fueling the activities of the Middle East's rising middle class, and working to bring the economies of the region more fully into the web of globalization, can push the status quo to the tipping point where national leaders have no choice but to embrace change and try to make the most of it. That is the key first step toward liberalization of the political systems. The road to human rights, social freedoms, and democracy runs through business growth and economic progress. \nIf we were to ponder how change in Iran can change the Middle East (as it did once before in 1979), and how the specter of a rising Iran could guide the region around it in a new direction we would have to conclude that things will go right when developments inside Iran align with the main trend that is afoot in the region. The strong interests of the West are in seeing Iran line up with, not against, the logic of economic change; to yield to a rising business sector and a new middle class that would change politics and religion and then amplify the same trend in the Arab world. But we are not going to be able to help Iranians get there, or leaders in the other critical nations of the region, until economics becomes as important to our thinking about policy as hard power. It is time to think less about civilizations clashing, and to recover the great insights \u2014 which lie very close to the foundations of classical liberalism and modern political thought \u2014 about the transformative power of markets and commerce. Commerce, as David Hume and the other great minds of the Scottish Enlightenment liked to point out, softens manners and makes a politics based on reason and deliberation, rather than fighting and romanticism, far more imaginable. \nThrough the course of this book, we will probe into the different prospects and challenges for the rising middle class in the countries whose fate is most pivotal for realizing this future in the Middle East. Some, such as Dubai and Turkey, are forging ahead at astonishing speed, while others are caught in a vise of internal contradictions, such as Iran and Pakistan. Coming to appreciate why the stories of the countries are so different, and understanding the distinctive perspective and desires of this new class will also require delving into the history of subjugation and misguided reform that has held the capitalist potential of the region down for so long. Only by developing a fresh perspective on the struggles of the region \u2014 so different from the compelling but fundamentally flawed story of an intractable clash of civilizations \u2014 will the West understand how best to engage with these countries in order to precipitate reform and vastly improved relations. \nContinues...

    "text": "When Poor Families Spend Unwisely\n2010-05-27T00:05:52.000Z\nTo the Editor:\nI have mixed feelings about Nicholas D. Kristof\u2019s May 23 column, \u201cMoonshine or the Kids?\u201d which describes poor families in Africa who don\u2019t have enough money for school but spend money on alcohol and cigarettes.\nI understand Mr. Kristof\u2019s frustration with people who appear not to have their priorities straight, but let\u2019s take a step back before we point fingers.\nLet\u2019s remember that a majority of people in this world use drugs, for both pleasure and for pain. The father Mr. Kristof describes is months behind on his rent, doesn\u2019t have enough money to support his family, and has lost two kids to what should be preventable illness. Should we expect him not to have a drink at the end of the day when so many of us do the same thing with a fraction of the problems he is facing?\nIt is tragic that so many people don\u2019t have adequate housing, education and health care. Yet these problems are systemic and not simply a result of individual choices. The cause and solutions are much larger than shaking our heads at people who have a few drinks or smokes to deal with the madness and injustice in this world.\nTony Newman Director of Media Relations Drug Policy Alliance New York, May 24, 2010\n\u2022\nTo the Editor:\nNicholas D. Kristof suggests that one of the greatest obstacles to overcoming poverty is that the poor (men in particular) spend to feed their vices while neglecting basics like education and mosquito nets for their children. Yet according to the World Health Organization, many of the world\u2019s poorest countries have high rates of alcohol abstention while the wealthiest drink to excess.\nFor example, in Haiti, 60 percent of men and women abstain from alcohol whereas in the United States only about 30 percent do. Alcohol consumption rates in Congo (2.6 liters a year) and in sub-Saharan Africa (4.5 liters a year) are much lower than in the United States (8.6 liters a year). The Labor Department estimates the average United States consumer spends $800 a year on alcohol and tobacco \u2014 almost half of the per capita income in the Congo Republic.\nIf Mr. Kristof truly wants to address the \u201cugly secret of global poverty,\u201d perhaps he should instead address the frivolity and indifference of the rich.\nRebecca Alexander East Palo Alto, Calif., May 24, 2010\n\u2022\nTo the Editor:\nI commend Nicholas D. Kristof for calling attention to the challenge of increasing poor households\u2019 investments in children\u2019s education. But I take issue with his analysis.\nMany governments around the world are financed by revenues generated by taxes on alcohol sales (for example, 40 percent of state revenues in my native state of Kerala, India, come from alcohol). Changing individual and household practices through women\u2019s empowerment and microsavings programs, while critical, are unlikely to have a substantial effect if structural factors like state policies related to alcohol and tobacco remain unaddressed.\nSuneeta Krishnan San Francisco, May 23, 2010\nThe writer is a social epidemiologist, Women\u2019s Global Health Imperative, RTI International.\n\u2022\nTo the Editor:\nAs researchers, we concur with Nicholas D. Kristof\u2019s findings. Microfinance programs provide safety nets for households in developing countries that have no public support mechanisms in place. And increased income does influence what households spend their money on.\nIn our study of rural households in Bangladesh presented last fall at the annual meeting of the American Public Health Association, we find that in households that borrow from such programs, regardless of gender or relationship of the borrower to others (father, mother, offspring), spending on food, medicine and medical care increases, as does spending on tobacco.\nBut spending on tobacco increases in smaller proportion than spending on food or medicine. These findings hold true regardless of the type of credit program.\nPerhaps as household members are increasingly being cared for, the fathers have reason to reward themselves with a smoke.\nDeborah Viola Qiuhu Shi Valhalla, N.Y., May 24, 2010\nThe writers are associate professor and professor, respectively, at New York Medical College.",
