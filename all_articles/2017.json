    "text": "In Bangladesh, a Flood and an Efficient Response\n2017-09-01T08:04:13.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 After two weeks of flooding, about half of Bangladesh is under water, 140 people have been killed, tens of thousands of families have been forced from their homes and well over a million acres of crops have been destroyed. The poorest, their rural livelihoods in ruins, will most likely have no choice but to head to the cities.\nAs experts attribute the frequency of immense floods to climate change, the thousands who move to Dhaka, the capital, and other cities should be considered climate refugees.\nThe floods have disrupted life in Dhaka, a megacity that is home to 16 million people. Roads turned into canals. Some people took to using boats. Some waded through waist-high water.\nDhaka is packed with an estimated 135,000 people per square mile and is already the densest metropolis in the world. Its creaky infrastructure can barely support the existing population. The arrival of thousands of flood victims will strain services further.\nThe August flood is being compared with two other major floods in the country: one in 1988, which resulted in more than 2,000 deaths; and another in 1998, which killed more than 1,000. The fewer deaths this time signify the country\u2019s increasing capacity to cope with floods. The same floods have taken more lives in the more sparsely populated areas of neighboring India and Nepal.\nBangladesh\u2019s history of frequent flooding and subsequent losses have led to greater investment in flood management. Public schools and mosques are built with a view to their potential use as shelters. Mobile phones, exceeding 100 million, have turned into an important tool for conveying information during a calamity. Bangladesh\u2019s government was quick to deploy the army, its soldiers being best equipped to reach remote villages and help with evacuation.\nThe August floods were caused primarily by overflow from the Brahmaputra River, which flows from northeastern India into northern Bangladesh. Shafiqul Islam, an acquaintance from the northern district of Dinajpur, told me that his father had never seen water rise so fast or so high in their village.\nMonira Parvin, his wife, sought refuge with their 5-year-old daughter at her parents\u2019 village in a dry area. Ms. Parvin is studying for an undergraduate degree, and her husband, who never made it to a college, proudly supports her. She represents a new generation of educated Bangladeshis, who are more aware of emergency practices such as timely flight to safety.\nIn previous floods, the destruction of agriculture caused acute food shortages. Since 2010, Bangladesh has become a food-surplus state; because of its grain reserves, there is little risk of the food scarcity of the past.\nThe most pressing concern for the victims of the flood is their reduced purchasing power. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has promised to offer each affected family 30 kilograms of rice at one-fifth the market price. There are other extensive agricultural and social safety support programs in place to help the victims.\nThere is a limit, though, to what Bangladesh can do by itself. Floods are a transnational affair, and when the big river systems running across China and India and then pouring into Bangladesh go into their seasonal churn, borders mean little. During the floods this time,  800 Indians from the state of West Bengal bordering Bangladesh sought shelter in Lalmonirhat, a northern district of Bangladesh.\nIndia has erected a forbidding barrier of concertina wire along the thousands of miles of border between the two countries. Indian border guards routinely shoot Bangladeshis attempting illegal crossings and kill 50 or more every year.\nThe Bangladesh border guards, however, did not try to prevent the Indians from crossing to escape the floods. The Indians are reported to have found shelter not just on streets, but also in Bangladeshi homes. A local resident said they \u201cstood by the flood-affected Indians.\u201d Common sense and humanity prevailed over jingoism and xenophobia on the India-Bangladesh border.\nThe increasing frequency and intensity of floods point to the need for cross-border cooperation on shared rivers. India, being both the bigger country and the one upriver, has to take the lead. That means signing water-sharing agreements, which have been pending for two decades. It also means rethinking India\u2019s frighteningly dangerous river-linking project that harks back to an era of grandiose development schemes.\nIf South Asia cannot work together on shared natural resources, it will be ill equipped to cope with the desperate rush of refugees. Going forward, climate change will displace millions \u2014 and there is no concertina wire strong enough to hold back multitudes desperate to survive.",

    "text": "More Than 1,000 Died in South Asia Floods This Summer\n2017-08-29T18:21:41.000Z\nMUMBAI, India \u2014 More than 1,000 people have died in floods across South Asia this summer, and as sheets of incessant rain pummeled the vast region on Tuesday, worries grew that the death toll would rise along with the floodwaters.\nAccording to the United Nations, at least 41 million people in Bangladesh, India and Nepal have been directly affected by flooding and landslides resulting from the monsoon rains, which usually begin in June and last until September.\nAnd while flooding in the Houston area has grabbed more attention, aid officials say a catastrophe is unfolding in South Asia.\nIn Nepal, thousands of homes have been destroyed and dozens of people swept away. Elephants were pressed into service, wading through swirling waters to rescue people, and aid workers have built rafts from bamboo and banana leaves.\nBut many people are still missing, and some families have held last rites without their loved ones\u2019 bodies being found.\n\u201cThis is the severest flooding in a number of years,\u201d Francis Markus, a spokesman for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said by phone from Kathmandu, Nepal\u2019s capital.\nNepal\u2019s flooded areas are the poorest parts of the country, where most families live in bare mud houses and rely on subsistence farming, he said. Those farms are now underwater, and thousands of people are stuck living under plastic tarps in camps for displaced people where disease is beginning to spread.\nAsked how the situation in Nepal compared with that in Houston, Mr. Markus said, \u201cWe hope people won\u2019t overlook the desperate needs of the people here because of the disasters closer home.\u201d\nIndia has also suffered immensely. Floods have swept across the states of Assam, Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal and other areas.\nThis weekend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi flew over the devastation in Bihar, where more than 400 people are believed to have died in floods in recent weeks. He pledged millions of dollars in assistance and urged insurance companies to send in assessors as soon as possible to help farmers cope with their losses.\nAnd the rain keeps coming.\nOn Tuesday, Mumbai, the sprawling financial capital, was soaked to the bone. Nearly all day, the rain drummed down. As people scurried up the sidewalks, the wind tore umbrellas out of their hands.\nThe sky seemed to fall lower and lower, pressing down on the building tops, cutting visibility to a few blocks, then a few yards. By midafternoon, it was so dark it felt like nightfall.\nBusy intersections were deluged, and cars struggled to part the muddy, greenish waters. Several Mumbai television channels reported that more rain had fallen on the city in the past several days than any other time since July 2005, when severe flooding killed more than 1,000 people in this part of India.\nMany trains and flights were delayed or canceled, marooning countless people. The authorities urged people to stay home and keep the roads clear for emergency vehicles. (Many did not heed that advice, leading to traffic snarls throughout the city on Tuesday evening.)\nSchools and colleges were shut. Rising water spilled into hospitals and sloshed across the floors.\nPolice officials warned people to leave their cars behind if they were caught in a flash flood.\nThe Mumbai police, writing on Twitter, urged people to abandon their cars if they encountered high water.\nThe monsoons have battered Bangladesh as well. A low-lying and densely populated country of 165 million, Bangladesh is chronically ravaged by flooding. This year\u2019s monsoons have left roughly a third of its terrain submerged.\nThe International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent said on its website that more than eight million Bangladeshis had been affected by the flooding, the worst in 40 years. At least 140 people have died, and nearly 700,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed.\nCorinne Ambler, a Red Cross spokeswoman in Bangladesh who had just taken an aerial tour of the devastation, said she was stunned.\n\u201cAll I could see was water, the whole way,\u201d she said in a telephone interview from Dhaka, the capital. \u201cYou have tiny little clumps of houses stuck in the middle of water.\u201d\nAfter visiting some of the afflicted villages by boat, she said that many Bangladeshis had told her, \u201cWe\u2019re used to flooding, but we\u2019ve never seen anything like this in our lives.\u201d",

    "text": "Bangladesh Plans to Build Huge Refugee Camp for Rohingya\n2017-09-16T13:37:01.000Z\nBANGKOK \u2014 Bangladesh, facing an unprecedented influx of ethnic Rohingya, plans to build a vast camp to house about 400,000 refugees who have poured into the country over the past three weeks.\nThe new settlements will be built within the next 10 days on 2,000 acres in the Cox\u2019s Bazar district near Bangladesh\u2019s border with Myanmar, officials have said. The authorities plan to construct 14,000 shelters, each with the capacity to hold six families, with the help of international aid organizations and the Bangladesh military.\nPoor and overpopulated, Bangladesh is no haven for the Rohingya, a long-persecuted Muslim minority from Buddhist-majority Myanmar. Camps were already overflowing with at least 400,000 Rohingya before the current exodus was provoked by Rohingya militants\u2019 attacking Myanmar police posts and an army base on Aug. 25.\nThe Myanmar military then began a campaign of village torchings, extrajudicial killings and gang rape, according to survivors and international rights groups. Witnesses and rights organizations have also accused the military of using helicopters to unleash a scorched-earth campaign, burning Rohingya villages.\nThe United Nations described the actions against the Rohingya as a \u201ctextbook example of ethnic cleansing.\u201d\nWith a record number of Rohingya fleeing over the border into Bangladesh, arrivals have been forced to line the streets of local villages, begging for food and water, and the current settlements have reached capacity.\nThe government said restrictions would be placed on any inhabitants of the planned settlement. Rohingya will also be barred from traveling by vehicle in Bangladesh, and only those registered as refugees will qualify for official assistance.\n\u201cThe Rohingya refugees won\u2019t be allowed to go outside the camp,\u201d Asaduzzaman Khan, the Bangladeshi minister of home affairs, said on Sept. 10.\nBangladesh stopped designating new refugees in the early 1990s, forcing hundreds of thousands to fend for themselves by cobbling together bits of tarpaulin and bamboo to build makeshift homes. This year, the government even debated a plan to confine all Rohingya refugees on a flood-prone uninhabited island.\nAid groups have expressed worry about hunger and diseases like cholera spreading through the squalid settlements in Bangladesh. The lack of an adequate sewage system is also compounding fears about public hygiene. The Bangladesh Department of Public Health Engineering said it would construct 500 temporary latrines, while the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has plans for 8,000 more.\nOn Sept. 12, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh visited a Rohingya camp in Kutupalong, where she hugged refugees and lamented the deaths of women and children.\n\u201cWe want peace; we want good relations with our neighboring countries,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t tolerate and accept any injustice.\u201d\nMs. Hasina is scheduled to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Sept. 21, where she is expected to ask for help from the international community to tackle the situation.\nDaw Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of Myanmar\u2019s civilian administration, announced she would skip the annual meeting. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has been criticized for defending the Myanmar military\u2019s crackdown and for staying silent about the plight of the Rohingya.\nMs. Hasina has urged Myanmar to take back the Rohingya who have fled to Bangladesh, much as Myanmar did during some earlier waves of displacement. Much smaller populations of Hindus, Buddhists and animists living in Rakhine State in western Myanmar have also been displaced by the violence.\nOn Friday, the Bangladesh government lodged a formal complaint with Myanmar about alleged violations of Bangladesh airspace by Myanmar military aircraft and drones. Myanmar dismissed a similar airspace protest this month.\nThe Bangladesh government has also been holding two Myanmar photographers covering the Rohingya crisis for a German magazine.\nThe two, Minzayar Oo and Hkun Lat, are accused of entering the country under false pretenses, on tourist visas. The Bangladeshi authorities have suggested that the two may be spies, a charge denied by their lawyers and families.",

    "text": "U.N. Economist Charged With Underpaying Household Worker From Bangladesh\n2017-06-20T23:49:59.000Z\nA United Nations economist was arrested on Tuesday on charges that he brought a household worker from Bangladesh to New York, where he underpaid and overworked her and also took steps to cover up his scheme.\nThe economist, Hamidur Rashid, a Bangladeshi, had obtained a special visa for the employee after submitting a signed contract to the United Nations stating that he would pay her $420 for a 40-hour workweek, or $10.50 an hour, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in Federal District Court in Manhattan.\nThe contract said Mr. Rashid, 50, would also pay the woman, who had once worked in his home in Dhaka, Bangladesh, for overtime hours and not charge her for food or lodging, the complaint added.\nBut Mr. Rashid then had her sign a second contract that said she would be paid only $290 a week, or $7.25 an hour, and that he could deduct up to $75 per week from her salary for food and lodging, the authorities said.\nAt various times, the complaint said, Mr. Rashid told the woman that if she worked for someone else, she would \u201cgo to jail and then back to Bangladesh.\u201d\nUltimately, Mr. Rashid did not pay the woman directly; rather, he paid her husband in Bangladesh the equivalent of $600 for each month she worked, which came to about $3.49 an hour, the complaint said.\nThe case was not the first in which federal charges have accused a diplomat of mistreating a domestic employee, with perhaps the most prominent episode involving an Indian diplomat who was allowed to return home in 2014 without facing trial in the United States. Her arrest had spurred sharp criticism of the United States by some Indian officials and heightened tensions between the two countries.\nMr. Rashid, though, does not represent his government. He is employed by the United Nations, which contends that diplomatic immunity does not absolve its employees from the need to obey United States laws.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that issues of immunities would not apply here,\u201d the United Nations spokesman, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, said.\nThe complaint says that Mr. Rashid \u201cenjoys limited diplomatic immunity with respect only to those acts undertaken in his official capacity\u201d and \u201cthis conduct\u201d was not within his official capacity. Among the charges against him are visa fraud and fraud in foreign labor contracting.\nThe woman, who was not identified, entered the United States in January 2013 and worked for Mr. Rashid in his home in Manhattan until October 2013, the complaint said.\nJoon H. Kim, the acting United States attorney in Manhattan, said that Mr. Rashid \u201ctook cruel advantage of his position of power.\u201d\nMr. Rashid once served as the coordinator of a program for the legal empowerment of the poor at the United Nations Development Program. In his current capacity as an economist for the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, he wrote papers warning of the economic slowdown in developing countries, including one, published in HuffPost, with the Columbia University economist Joseph E. Stiglitz.\nA United Nations biography says Mr. Rashid worked in his country\u2019s foreign ministry and describes him as \u201ca catalyst\u201d in Bangladesh\u2019s accession to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption and the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission of Bangladesh.\nChristopher A. Flood, a lawyer for Mr. Rashid, declined to comment.",

    "text": "To Secular Bangladeshis, Textbook Changes Are a Harbinger\n2017-01-23T02:05:45.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Bangladesh\u2019s Education Ministry was preparing to print the 2017 editions of its standard Bengali textbooks when a group of conservative Islamic religious scholars demanded the removal of 17 poems and stories they deemed \u201catheistic.\u201d\nBy the time the books were distributed to schools on Jan. 1, the 17 poems and stories were gone, with no explanation from the government. Other changes had crept in, too: First graders studying the alphabet were taught that \u201co\u201d stands for \u201corna,\u201d a scarf worn by devout Muslim girls starting at puberty, not for \u201col,\u201d a type of yam; and a sixth-grade travelogue describing a visit to the Hindu-dominated north of India was replaced by one about the Nile in Egypt.\nThe changes were barely noticeable to the general public, but they alarmed some Bangladesh intellectuals, who saw them as the government\u2019s accommodating a larger shift toward radical Islam.\nBangladesh has struggled to contain extremist violence in recent years, as Islamist militants have targeted secular writers and intellectuals. But equally significant, over the long term, are changes taking place in the general population: The number of women wearing the hijab has gradually risen, as has the number of students enrolled in madrasas, or Islamic schools.\nThat religious organizations now have a hand in editing textbooks, a prerogative they sought for years, suggests that their influence is growing, even with the Awami League party, which is avowedly secular, in power.\nIt is a shift that, increasingly, worries the United States. Bangladesh broke away from Pakistan in 1971, and in the decades that followed, it defined itself as adamantly secular and democratic.\nFor years, this ideology seemed to serve as an insulating force. Transnational jihadist networks that flourished in Afghanistan and Pakistan found little purchase in Bangladesh, despite its dense, poor Muslim population and porous borders.\nBut over the last several years, as extremist attacks on atheist bloggers and intellectuals became commonplace, secular thought was also fast receding from Bangladesh\u2019s public spaces.\nIslamist organizations, analysts say, are so skilled at mobilizing that it has become harder for the government to ignore their demands, especially with a general election coming in 2019.\nHefazat-e-Islam, a vast Islamic organization based in Dhaka, the capital, first called for changes to the textbooks during huge rallies in 2013.\n\u201cWe went to the higher-ups in the government,\u201d Mufti Fayez Ullah, the group\u2019s joint secretary general, said. \u201cThe government realized, \u2018Yes, the Muslims should not learn this.\u2019 So they amended it. I want to add that all the political parties, they consider their popularity among the people.\u201d\nA spokesman for the Education Ministry would not comment on the changes. Narayan Chandra Saha, chairman of the National Curriculum and Textbook Board, said the revisions were routine and not made at anyone\u2019s request.\n\u201cIf Hefazat claims the changes were made per their demand, I have nothing to say in this regard,\u201d he said.\nA protest against the changes, held outside the textbook board\u2019s offices on Sunday, drew a few hundred students and political activists. But there has been no criticism from the country\u2019s main opposition party, the Bangladesh National Party, which typically pounces on any controversial move by the Awami League.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like there is perfect consensus between the ruling party and the opposition on these issues,\u201d said Amena Mohsin, a professor of international relations at the University of Dhaka. \u201cIn a majoritarian democracy, you give in to populism.\u201d\nThe divide between Islamist and secular Bangladeshis came into sharp, sudden focus in 2013, when tens of thousands of activists \u2014 mostly students at provincial madrasas \u2014 flooded into the center of Dhaka with a list of demands: punishment for \u201catheist bloggers,\u201d the destruction of sculptures and mandatory Islamic education, including changes to textbooks.\nThe government, alarmed, put forward its own education overhaul. Beginning in 2014, education officials required the country\u2019s 10,000 government-registered madrasas to use standardized government textbooks through eighth grade, in the hope of better integrating young people from conservative backgrounds.\nSiddiqur Rahman, a retired educator leading the effort to revise government textbooks for use by madrasas, said the goal was \u201cpushing them into general education.\u201d\n\u201cThere was a wide gap in beliefs and thinking and attitude,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are trying to change the attitudes of people on the street. It is difficult, but not impossible.\u201d\nIt has required many compromises with religious leaders.\nMadrasa leaders, in written recommendations to education officials, requested that \u201cbeautiful Islamic names\u201d replace Hindu, Christian or foreign-sounding names in textbooks used in madrasas, saying this was \u201cthe concrete right of the people of Islamic monotheism.\u201d They also requested the omission of any conversation between boys and girls, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a great sin in Islam to talk to a young girl for nothing.\u201d\nThe authorities, apparently, were quite receptive. In English textbooks for use in madrasas, all Hindu, Christian or foreign-sounding names have been replaced by Muslim names. Conversations between boys and girls have been omitted. Illustrations of girls with bare heads have been edited out. The word \u201cperiod\u201d was removed from a section on girls\u2019 physical development. The name of the chairman of the textbook board, a Hindu professor, does not appear.\n\u201cThe government was a little flexible in that regard,\u201d Mr. Rahman said. \u201cI think that for achieving the greater good, some sacrifice should be made.\u201d\nBut the officials who oversaw the editing initially refused Hefazat\u2019s demand to omit the 17 poems and stories from the general textbook, used in 20,000 secondary schools as well as madrasas, according to two officials on the National Curriculum and Textbook Board, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to reporters.\nMufti Fayez Ullah, of Hefazat-e-Islam, said he had been compelled to go over those people\u2019s heads to high-ranking officials.\n\u201cIf the government is willing to address this demand, bureaucracy cannot be that much of a hurdle,\u201d he said. \u201cWe went to the Education Ministry. We went to the higher-ups in the government.\u201d\nRasheda K. Choudhury, an activist who served as a government adviser to the Education Ministry under the previous administration, said it was unclear who made the decision to accept the Islamists\u2019 changes.\n\u201cNobody knew about it. Nobody is taking responsibility,\u201d she said. \u201cParents are asking me, \u2018Should we start teaching our children at home?\u2019\u201d\nThe leaders of Hefazat-e-Islam, meanwhile, are eager to suggest the next round of changes. Arts and crafts courses should not instruct children to depict anything living, which is proscribed by Islam, and should instead offer instruction only in calligraphy, said Abdullah Wasel, a member of Hefazat\u2019s central committee. The group also wants to eliminate physical education textbooks that depict exercise by girls or young women, Mr. Fayez Ullah said.\n\u201cWhat boys do, girls cannot do,\u201d he said. \u201cI can climb a tree, but my wife and sister, they cannot. It is not necessary to have pictures of girls doing exercise.\u201d\nBut the larger goal, he said, goes far beyond textbooks. He hopes to push through a full separation of boys and girls beginning in the fifth grade. Mixing of sexes in the classroom, he said, results in young men and women who \u201cprefer to live together, prefer to have physical relations before marriage.\u201d\nAs for the National Curriculum and Textbook Board, Hefazat has petitioned the government to remove every current member, starting with the board\u2019s chairman, Mr. Saha, who is Hindu, Mr. Fayez Ullah said.\n\u201cI would like to raise the question \u2014 and I am not saying I am against him \u2014 but is there not any Muslim that can be a chairman of the textbook board in this country?\u201d he said. The group, he said, has requested that Mr. Saha be replaced with \u201ca patriot who understands the sentiment and spirit of the population of Bangladesh.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cYou cannot expect to grow jackfruit from a mango tree.\u201d",

    "text": "Beyond Houston, a World Awash\n2017-08-31T07:21:23.000Z\nHouston isn\u2019t the only major city reeling from record rainfall and devastating floods. In Mumbai, India, where summer monsoons are annual events, as much rain fell in 12 hours on Tuesday as normally does over 11 days in a typical monsoon, paralyzing the city, India\u2019s financial capital.\nSo far this summer, flooding has killed more than 1,000 people in India, Nepal and perennially flood-prone Bangladesh. The United Nations says at least 41 million people have been directly affected by flooding and landslides in South Asia, with homes and croplands destroyed. Floods from heavy rainfall have also ripped through Britain, Ireland, Sudan and Uganda in Africa. On Aug. 14, torrents of water swept through the streets of Sierra Leone\u2019s capital, Freetown, and a massive mudslide left some 1,000 people dead or missing.\nLike the calamity in Texas, these unnatural rainfalls carry two messages. One is the risk of unregulated development. As in Houston, officials in India have paid little attention to the consequences of rapid urban growth in low-lying, watery environments with few natural defenses against a deluge when it comes. And, like Houston, which has suffered floods in the past, Mumbai was hit by severe flooding in 2005 that claimed more than 500 lives, yet it did little to address the issues that made that flooding so deadly.\nThe second message is that unabated climate change does, indeed, exact a price. Warmer weather heats the oceans, which causes more evaporation, which increases moisture in the atmosphere, which then falls as driving rain. Warmer oceans also rise, partly due to thermal expansion, which in turn threatens low-lying areas; among climate scientists, Bangladesh has for years been the poster child of nations that are likely to face famine, flooding and forced migration as a result of rising sea levels caused by global warming.\nIt does not have to be this bad the next time around. Cities around the world are taking steps to become more resilient, so they can better cope when exceptional weather events occur. Upgrading sewage, drainage and transportation infrastructure; increasing green spaces; restoring wetlands; and using zoning laws to prevent new construction in known flood plains and vulnerable coastal areas are all obvious steps that can help. Early-warning systems, sorely lacking in many developing countries, are also critical, as are evacuation and emergency response plans. Reforestation can help prevent landslides and bolster the capacity for rain to be absorbed upstream.\nAs the world has long recognized, most recently at the Paris summit meeting on climate change in December 2015, poor nations will need a helping hand from rich ones as they transition to cleaner, low-carbon energy sources. This is not something the Trump administration seems inclined to offer, any more than it seems inclined to listen to the scientists, join with other nations to combat the problem or do something about America\u2019s own greenhouse gas emissions.\nThat\u2019s unconscionable, even borderline nuts, especially now that President Trump himself has seen at first hand the results of inaction.",

    "text": "A Desperate Trek Toward Misery and Resignation: Capturing the Plight of the Rohingya\n2017-12-29T19:18:31.000Z\nTimes Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights from The New York Times. In this piece, Adam Dean and Tomas Munita, two photographers whose work appears regularly in The Times, describe their coverage of the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar and Bangladesh.\nI reached the border between Myanmar and Bangladesh in late August, just days after a series of violent clashes \u2014 and the Myanmar army\u2019s brutal response. Tens of thousands of Rohingya were already beginning to arrive in Bangladesh. They had spent days trekking from their villages.\nI was one of the first photographers to cover the story. We already had begun to realize that this was unfolding into a significant crisis, but it wasn\u2019t until I arrived to the hills the Rohingya were crossing that I got a sense of the scale of the exodus.\nThe day I arrived, I approached a few families resting in a clearing. They were covered in mud and had few possessions. Many of them were barefoot. They all looked exhausted from walking for days through the monsoon rains, in extreme heat and humidity, and with little food or water.\nI set out against the flow of humanity, traveling for miles over mountains, through streams and across flooded paddy fields. Every traumatized face I passed had a look of numb exhaustion.\nFor weeks after that, the number of people \u2014 each with their own stories of surviving unimaginable pain and suffering \u2014 increased. And the arduous routes they risked to cross into Bangladesh hinted at the depth of the brutality they were escaping back home.\nEarly on, I met and photographed Hafej Ahmad, 35, as he crawled through muddy puddles of monsoon rain in the overflow area of Balukhali refugee camp. Because of a birth defect, he was unable to walk. He wore worn-out flip-flops on his hands, dragging himself through the mud while he searched for a space on the hillside to build a shelter for his wife and four children \u2014 out of bamboo poles and plastic sheeting that he had purchased from a nearby market.\nHe had arrived the night before, after eight days crawling from his village in Myanmar to cross into Bangladesh with his family.\nOn an island near the southern tip of Bangladesh, refugees began arriving by fishing boats; they crossed the mouth of the Naf River where it flowed into the Bay of Bengal. The boats were crammed with people, all of them racing to make the crossing in the monsoon swells before their boats were intercepted by patrolling coast guards.\nMany of these boats sank, and hundreds of refugees drowned. I witnessed the panic as they struggled to reach safety on the beach, with waves crashing around them.\nI was awed at the danger the Rohingya were willing to face to reach the uncertainty \u2014 but relative safety \u2014 of life in the camps.\nEven in the camps, though, there was little relief. And some of the hardest things to witness were the cruelty and desperation at the haphazard aid distributions.\nA large proportion of the refugees were women and children. Everyone was hungry, but not everyone was guaranteed food. Even months after the crisis started, daily food handouts were chaotic. At one of the food distribution sites, thousands of children would turn up for a free hot meal each day. Often, half of them went home hungry after waiting for hours under the hot sun. Bangladeshi soldiers and Rohingya volunteers with bamboo canes would whip and beat the crowds of kids as they surged forward. Smaller children were trampled in the chaos, or sent to the back of the lines with tears running down their faces.\nI had never covered a refugee migration before and was overwhelmed by the strength and dignity of the people I met \u2014 and by the hardships they endured.\nMuted sounds: That was my first impression when I walked off the chaotic Teknaf Road in southeast Bangladesh into the massive, overcrowded makeshift camp. So many people, and yet it was almost silent.\nThe sounds I did hear were faint: babies crying, people coughing, footsteps through the mud.\nChildren don\u2019t play here; they take care of their younger siblings. Neighbors don\u2019t know each other. Families \u2014 or what is left of families \u2014 try to prepare the little area where they have just arrived to stay for months or years.\nThe people here carry memories of unspeakable violence. Many of the women begging on the road tell similar stories: that their husbands had their throats slit in front of the family, that they lost everything and had to walk for several days, sometimes under heavy rain; that they hid in the jungle, eating leaves.\nTheir lives were taken away by armed men who shouted, \u201cThis is not your land, go to Bangladesh.\u201d These men burned houses, killed people, cut down trees, slaughtered animals, raped women and broke the bones of young children.\nElders have an emptiness in their eyes. In others, the mothers especially, I see desperation. In the children I see resignation.\nThese are people torn from their lives and their livelihoods, and there is no bridge to anywhere better. They are in a shock so terrible that it\u2019s shocking to witness, and difficult to describe.\nThey are farmers condemned to beg and live in misery. They have to struggle among each other for a little bag of rice. They have to endure the suffocating heat under makeshift houses made of plastic.\nThey have lost any sense of privacy. The children have become caretakers and beggars.",

    "text": "Deal on Rohingya Repatriation Inches Forward, but Hurdles Remain\n2017-11-23T11:45:33.000Z\nBANGKOK \u2014 Myanmar and Bangladesh said Thursday that they had moved one step closer to the possible repatriation of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who have fled Myanmar for Bangladesh over the past three months.\nMore than 620,000 Rohingya, a mainly Muslim ethnic minority in Myanmar, have flooded into Bangladesh, escaping what the United States on Wednesday termed \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d by Myanmar\u2019s security forces.\n\u201cThe first step of the repatriation process has been done,\u201d said Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali of Bangladesh, after going to Myanmar\u2019s capital, Naypyidaw, to meet with officials there.\nBut even as the two countries announced they had signed an \u201carrangement\u201d on returning displaced Rohingya to Rakhine State in Myanmar, the fractious and uncertain nature of the accord overshadowed the news. Neither side gave many details, apart from a vague commitment to beginning a repatriation process within two months\u2019 time.\nWhile Myanmar has pushed for the return of any Rohingya to be conducted bilaterally, the Bangladeshis have called for international agencies to be involved.\nEarlier, the Myanmar authorities said they would, in principle, allow for the return of displaced Rohingya if they could prove that they had lived in Myanmar before fleeing across the border over the past three months.\nMr. Ali, who in September accused Myanmar\u2019s military of killing thousands of Rohingya, said he would not divulge the terms and conditions of any accord until Saturday. But he put the onus of responsibility on Myanmar.\nRefugees pouring into Bangladesh from Rakhine, in Myanmar\u2019s west, have described civilians being executed, women gang-raped and villages systematically razed by fire.\n\u201cSince their houses are burned and destroyed,\u201d Mr. Ali said, \u201cthey need to be rebuilt.\u201d\nThe Myanmar authorities have in recent weeks balked at the possibility of the Rohingya, whom they consider to be illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, returning to their native villages. Instead, Myanmar\u2019s government has spoken obliquely of camps where they might be sequestered.\nAround 120,000 Rohingya already live in such camps in the central part of Rakhine after a wave of violence in 2012 forced them from their homes.\nIn late October, officials in Myanmar ordered the harvesting of fields that had been deserted in the Rohingya exodus. The authorities in Myanmar have said they will confiscate all land that they consider \u201cabandoned.\u201d\nOther serious obstacles remain to any repatriation. For one, it\u2019s not clear whether Myanmar\u2019s military, which largely succeeded in ridding a Buddhist-majority country of a hated Muslim minority, would accept a proof of their residence if returning Rohingya were even able to offer it. Many fled without any papers. Others never had any.\nAlmost all Rohingya are stateless, stuck in an official netherworld between the two countries.\nIt\u2019s also not certain whether the vast majority of Rohingya would want to return to a place where the security forces have unleashed what the United States and others have labeled crimes against humanity.\n\u201cI will never go back home,\u201d said Mohamed Rafique, a Muslim cleric who arrived in a refugee camp in Bangladesh in September. \u201cHow can I go back to a place where they want to kill me?\u201d\nBangladesh, itself poor and overcrowded, is struggling to cope with the influx, which has created on the country\u2019s eastern flank one of the world\u2019s largest refugee camps.\nHuman rights groups worry that this sprawling settlement could be a breeding ground for disease and religious radicalism.\nThe latest surge of refugees began after Rohingya militants attacked Myanmar security outposts in late August. A previous strike by Rohingya insurgents a year ago also sent around 100,000 refugees to Bangladesh.\nMeanwhile, Sr. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the commander in chief of Myanmar\u2019s military, said in a statement last week that \u201cit is impossible to accept the number of persons proposed by Bangladesh.\u201d\nHe also raised doubts about any repatriation process, saying that it had to be \u201cacceptable\u201d to ethnic Rakhine Buddhists who have been accused of aiding in pogroms against the Rohingya.\n\u201cEmphasis must be placed on the wishes of local Rakhine ethnic people who are real Myanmar citizens,\u201d said an English statement on the military commander\u2019s Facebook page, before warning that any \u201cunacceptable situation\u201d could lead to \u201cpolitical instability.\u201d",

    "text": "Desperate Rohingya Flee Myanmar on Trail of Suffering: \u2018It Is All Gone\u2019\n2017-09-02T18:14:28.000Z\nREZU AMTALI, Bangladesh \u2014 They stumble down muddy ravines and flooded creeks through miles of hills and jungle in Bangladesh, and thousands more come each day, in a line stretching to the monsoon-darkened horizon.\nSome are gaunt and spent, already starving and carrying listless and dehydrated babies, with many miles to go before they reach any refugee camp.\nThey are tens of thousands of Rohingya, who arrive bearing accounts of massacre at the hands of the Myanmar security forces and allied mobs that started on Aug. 25, after Rohingya militants staged attacks against government forces.\nThe retaliation that followed was carried out in methodical assaults on villages, with helicopters raining down fire on civilians and front-line troops cutting off families\u2019 escape. The villagers\u2019 accounts all portray indiscriminate attacks against fleeing noncombatants, adding to a death toll that even in early estimates is high into the hundreds, and is probably vastly worse.\n\u201cThere are no more villages left, none at all,\u201d said Rashed Ahmed, a 46-year-old farmer from a hamlet in Maungdaw Township in Myanmar. He had already been walking for four days. \u201cThere are no more people left, either,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is all gone.\u201d\nThe Rohingya are a Muslim ethnic minority who live in Myanmar\u2019s far western Rakhine State. Most were stripped of their citizenship by the military junta that used to rule Myanmar, and they have suffered decades of repression under the country\u2019s Buddhist majority, including killings and mass rape, according to the United Nations. A new armed resistance is giving the military more reasons to oppress them.\nBut the past week\u2019s exodus of civilians caught in the middle, which the United Nations said had reached nearly 76,000 on Saturday, dwarfs previous outflows of refugees to Bangladesh in such a short time period. Friday\u2019s influx alone was the single largest movement of Rohingya here in more than a generation, according to the United Nations office in Dhaka.\nThe dying is not yet done. Some of the Rohingya militants have persuaded or coerced men and boys to stay behind and keep up the fight. And civilians who have stayed on the trail are running toward conditions so grim that they constitute a second humanitarian catastrophe.\nThey face another round of gunfire from Myanmar\u2019s border guards, and miles of treacherous hill trails and flood-swollen streams and mud fields ahead before they reach crowded camps without enough food or medical help. Dozens were killed when their boats overturned, leaving the bodies of women and children washed up on river banks.\nTens of thousands more Rohingya are waiting for the Bangladeshi border force to allow them to enter. Still more are moving north from the Rohingya-dominated districts of Rakhine State. And the violence there continues.\n\u201cIt breaks all records of inhumanity,\u201d said a member of the Border Guard Bangladesh named Anamul, stationed at the Kutupalong Rohingya refugee camp. \u201cI have never seen anything like this.\u201d\nHere, in the forests of Rezu Amtali near the border with Myanmar, dozens of Rohingya told stories that were horrifying in their content and consistency.\nAfter militants from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army attacked police posts and an army base on Aug. 25, killing more than a dozen, the Myanmar military began torching entire villages with helicopters and petrol bombs, aided by Buddhist vigilantes from the ethnic Rakhine group, those fleeing the violence said.\nPerson after person along the trail into Bangladesh told of how the security forces cordoned off Rohingya villages as the fire rained down, and then shot and stabbed civilians. Children were not exempt.\nMizanur Rahman recalled how on Aug. 25 he had been working in a rice paddy in his village, known in Rohingya as Ton Bazar, in Buthidaung Township in Myanmar, when helicopters roared into the sky above him.\n\u201cImmediately, I had fear in my heart,\u201d he said. His wife came running out of their house with their son, less than a month old.\nThey escaped to a nearby forest and watched as the choppers\u2019 weapons engulfed the village in flames. Myanmar security forces descended, and the sound of gunfire reached the forest.\nMr. Rahman\u2019s extended family fled the next day, but not before seeing his brother\u2019s body lying on the ground, along with seven others. Three days later, as they climbed a hill near the border with Bangladesh, Mr. Rahman\u2019s mother was shot dead by a Myanmar border guard.\n\u201cNow we are supposed to be safe in Bangladesh, but I do not feel safe,\u201d Mr. Rahman said, as he wandered through a market in the Kutupalong refugee camp, with no money in his pocket.\nHis wife\u2019s postpartum bleeding has increased so much that she can no longer walk or produce milk for their infant son. The baby, cradled in Mr. Rahman\u2019s arms, looked skeletal, parched skin pinched at his joints. Other refugees took turns gently touching the baby\u2019s feet to check if he was still alive.\nThe Myanmar military said on Friday that nearly 400 people had been killed in the violence that has swept across northern Rakhine since Aug. 25. Of that death toll, 370 people were identified as Rohingya fighters. Fourteen civilians, including four ethnic Rakhine and seven Hindus, were also reported killed. Myanmar officials, however, have given no specific accounting of civilian Rohingya deaths.\nDozens of people I spoke to on the refugee trail said they had seen multiple people shot dead in at least 15 different villages. Others spoke of families burned alive in their homes. Human rights groups, while sifting through survivors\u2019 testimonies, have begun to make estimates that could add up to hundreds of Rohingya killed over the past week.\nHuman Rights Watch, the New York-based watchdog, documented 17 sites where satellite imagery showed extensive fire damage, including one village where 700 buildings had burned.\nThe Myanmar government claims Rohingya militants have torched their own homes in a bid for international sympathy. And the military maintains its current operations in Rakhine are designed at rooting out \u201cextremist terrorists.\u201d\nThere are, clearly, combatants on the Rohingya side. The state news media have reported that more than 50 clashes have broken out between the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, known by the acronym ARSA, and Myanmar security forces over the past week.\nThat has further complicated life for civilians trying to flee.\nFortify Rights, a human-rights group based in Bangkok, interviewed villagers remaining in Maungdaw township who said that ARSA was forcing men and boys to stay and fight. The refugees flowing into Bangladesh have been predominantly women and children, leading to speculation as to where the men are.\nMr. Ahmed, the farmer, said that he was too old to fight, but that 20 others from his village, Renuaz, had remained. \u201cThey have nothing to lose,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Myanmar government wants to eradicate an entire ethnic group.\u201d\nWhat the survivors are fleeing into is no haven. Bangladesh is itself poor, overcrowded and waterlogged, and has been reluctant to take on more displaced Rohingya. Around 400,000 already lived here before the exodus, according to government figures.\nAn urgent humanitarian disaster is brewing here in a country hard-pressed to feed itself, much less a new influx of refugees that one Bangladeshi official estimated could soon surpass 100,000 people.\nFor now, the Border Guard Bangladesh is mostly turning a blind eye and allowing the Rohingya to stream across the border.\nBut there is little help for them here, as they push on in hopes of reaching some of the grim refugee camps further in.\nA week after Myanmar\u2019s military crackdown began, volunteers for the World Food Program in Bangladesh worried that they had not been able to offer rice to the new arrivals at the camps.\n\u201cWe are waiting for an order but it has not come yet,\u201d said Mohamed Yasin, a Rohingya who hands out food for the United Nations organization.\nThe luckiest of the Rohingya leaving the violence by trekking through the Chittagong Hills hefted bamboo poles laden with their most treasured belongings: sacks of rice, umbrellas, solar panels, water pots and grass mats.\nOthers, though, carried nothing at all because they had no time to organize anything before their flight. Toddlers marched naked. Not a single person wore shoes, which would have been ripped off by the sucking mud.\nOne woman staggered down a ravine in the downpour, an infant clutched in one arm and a live chicken in a bag held in her other. Tripping on a root or a rock, she suddenly fell backward into deep mud. Both she and the baby were so weak that there was no cry as they fell.\nI reached out my hand to pull her up, and our eyes met, but she was too exhausted to form any other reaction. She immediately turned her gaze forward to the trail, and I watched her as she made her way down the gully and began trudging up a creek.\nAn international response to the crisis has started. On Wednesday, Britain arranged for a closed-door meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the Rohingya emergency. The civilian government of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has faced mounting global criticism for refusing to acknowledge the magnitude of the military offensive on civilian Rohingya populations.\nOn Tuesday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, rejected allegations from Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s administration that international aid organizations were somehow complicit in aiding Rohingya militants.\nEarlier this year, the United Nations set up a special commission to investigate another military onslaught that caused 85,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh over the course of the following months, following an ARSA attack on police posts in October. But Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s government has barred the United Nations team from Myanmar.\nIn an open letter to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, nearly a dozen of her fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureates labeled last October\u2019s military offensive \u201ca human tragedy amounting to ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.\u201d\n\u201cSome international experts have warned of the potential for genocide,\u201d said the letter, signed by Desmond Tutu and Malala Yousafzai, among others. \u201cIt has all the hallmarks of recent past tragedies: Rwanda, Darfur, Bosnia, Kosovo.\u201d\nOn Thursday and Friday, when thousands of refugees finally reached the village of Rezu Amtali, a five-hour trek through the hills from the border, there were no aid groups to meet them.\nSympathetic villagers offered some drinking water and packets of snacks, while autorickshaw drivers ferried families to the sprawl of makeshift settlements that surround the Kutupalong camp. Most had to walk hours more, through torrential downpours, to reach the refugee shantytown.\nStanding at the edge of a muddy path to Rezu Amtali, after a five-day journey with only a few handfuls of ruined rice to sustain them, a 6-year-old girl named Roufaja tugged at her mother\u2019s sleeve. \u201cAre we in Bangladesh yet?\u201d she asked.\nHer mother, Fatima Khatun \u2014 whose husband was presumed dead and sister had been raped by the security forces who had besieged their village \u2014 replied that they were.\n\u201cWhat are we going to do now?\u201d her daughter asked, pulling at her sleeve again. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d",

    "text": "What Climate Scientists Want You to See in the Floodwaters\n2017-09-02T20:47:41.000Z\nSTANFORD, Calif. \u2014 Like most Americans this week, we have been transfixed by the still unfolding disaster in Houston and coastal Texas, described on the airwaves as \u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201cbeyond anything experienced.\u201d\nIf that wasn\u2019t bad enough, on the other side of the globe, another climate-related calamity has been unfolding, though it has received less attention: the ongoing monsoon flooding in India, Bangladesh and Nepal that has killed more than 1,000 people and displaced millions. As in Houston, recovery there will take years.\nAs scientists who study climate risks and how societies can respond, we have been jolted to think hard about our best understanding of why disasters like these occur, how a changing climate cranks up the odds and what we might do differently.\nThe answer, for scientists and everyone else who has been watching, is not to say definitively and dismissively, \u201cThis is the result of climate change\u201d or \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d It\u2019s a chance to understand what is actually happening to the climate and all the ways human behavior leads to \u2014 and can mitigate \u2014 future disaster.\nWe start with two premises. Climate change doesn\u2019t cause extreme events. It amplifies them. And in any weather-related calamity, our susceptibility to harm is, at its root, constructed by ourselves.\nOn the climate side of risk, we have unambiguous evidence that the hazards are changing. Our emissions of heat-trapping gases have already increased the likelihood and severity of heat waves, extreme rainfall and storm surges. Much of the world\u2019s population occupies places susceptible to this kind of extreme weather that will increasingly be exacerbated by the changing climate.\nScientists can now even evaluate how much climate change has increased the odds of individual extreme events, including rainfall and flooding. In the weeks and months to come, we will surely see specific analyses of climate change\u2019s role in the flooding in both Texas and South Asia. Put simply, a warmer atmosphere can hold more water, increasing the potential for heavy downpours. Storm surge now occurs on top of sea level rise, increasing flooding risk. And warmer oceans can produce more intense hurricanes, as has occurred in the North Atlantic and the Gulf.\nUnprecedented is increasingly the norm. Without ambitious efforts to drive down global emissions, the changes will be stark, with up to eight feet of sea level rise possible this century. Even with stringent emissions reductions, some further warming is in the pipeline, carrying risks.\nOn the human side of risk, we should as a society embrace the fact that how and where we build our homes, plant our crops, construct our roads and bridges, and locate our schools and industries can provide resilience and safety rather than invite calamity. When rivers overtop their banks with floodwaters, for instance, does the water flow into wide-open flood plains and city streets with good drainage, or are those flood plains paved over and the drainage clogged? Consider that while the Texas Medical Center was able to maintain continuous care for its patients, thanks to dozens of floodgates and aboveground generators, the hospital became largely inaccessible when surrounding streets turned into rivers.\nWe don\u2019t have to be sitting ducks. For the types of flooding seen this week, the options start with individual and collective actions that make us safer for tomorrow\u2019s storm. To protect future generations as the climate changes, we also need to stretch to more challenging, longer-term efforts.\nWe can take actions today that will make us more prepared, no matter what tomorrow holds. People can elevate power outlets in their homes, know their evacuation zone and have an emergency plan. Buildings can be raised and designed to resist hurricane-force winds. Such methods are tested and known to save lives and money.\nBut even basic measures require commitment and foresight. In Florida, stringent building codes adopted after Hurricane Andrew are in danger of being weakened, which would make houses cheaper to build, yet vulnerable. As floods fade from memory, holding on to the lessons learned takes diligence when short-term gains push us in the other direction.\nThere are also ways we can better unleash market forces to shape who and what are exposed. One mechanism for doing so, the National Flood Insurance Program, is billions of dollars in debt and ripe for reform. Flood insurance premiums signal risk to potential homeowners and promote smart development, but they must reflect true risk to work. With rising seas and shifting rainfall, risk is a moving target. New York City took the unusual step of developing two flood risk maps, one for current sea levels and one for future sea levels. This kind of proactive thinking empowers households and businesses to be forward-looking, cognizant of changes to come.\n\nLong-term climate change will necessitate more creative solutions. For example, one obvious yet controversial way to reduce risk is simply moving out of harm\u2019s way. Hundreds of local governments in the United States, from Harris County, Tex., to Fairbanks, Alaska, have exercised this option already, buying up properties that have repeatedly been flooded and restoring the land to open space.\nBut because of sea level rise in this century, four million to 13 million Americans may be inundated, far beyond the capacity of current relocation programs. New approaches will be necessary. Norfolk, Va., particularly vulnerable to rising seas, has developed an end-of-the-century vision to target infrastructure investments with climate change in mind. Such long-range planning is needed to sustain vibrant, rich communities and economies for decades to come.\nWe are not completely at the whims of the weather. With available tools and an eye toward the future, we can limit the amount of climate change that occurs, minimize the risks that remain and build a resilient future.",

    "text": "A Lesson on Warming, From an Icy River\n2017-04-20T14:18:42.000Z\nIn the wilds of the Canadian Yukon, nature has provided fresh evidence of the destructive power of humans, and a stark warning of the dangers billions of people may face.\nDuring last year\u2019s unusually warm spring, meltwater from the Kaskawulsh Glacier cut a canyon through the ice that diverted water from the Slims and Yukon Rivers, which flow north into the Bering Sea, into the Alsek River, flowing south into the Pacific Ocean. Where water once coursed through the Slims River basin, dry riverbeds are now subject to frequent dust storms.\nThis process of \u201criver piracy\u201d \u2014 in which one stream captures and diverts another \u2014 appears to be the first example of river piracy observed in modern times. What has normally taken thousands of years or longer in the geological past, took just a few months in the Slims River basin.\nThe implications are ominous for people around the world who depend on glacier-fed rivers for agriculture, industry and drinking water and add even more urgency to the need for reducing fossil-fuel emissions that cause climate change.\nThe scientists who published the report of the diversion in the journal Nature Geoscience this month warned that, as glaciers melt, \u201cwe may see differences in the river networks and where rivers decide to go.\u201d\nAnd glaciers are melting. In just three decades, the glaciers in Montana\u2019s Glacier National Park may no longer exist, given the rate at which they are disappearing. The glaciers in the Himalayas that feed rivers that flow into China, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan are also receding at a rapid clip, as are glaciers in Europe. Melting glaciers are already putting millions of people at risk of floods, droughts and shrinking water supplies. They are also causing sea levels to rise, putting coastal areas around the world at risk of flooding and erosion.\nAnd now we know, as the researchers put it, \u201cRadical reorganizations of drainage can occur in a geologic instant, although they may also be driven by longer-term climate change.\u201d\nThis report should serve as an urgent call to action, not only for carbon reduction, but also to consider the onerous emergency plans that will be needed should those crucial efforts fail.",

    "text": "Our Moral Opportunity on Climate Change\n2017-11-04T02:03:09.000Z\nAs a global family of churches, the Anglican Communion has stood alongside other faiths in prayerful solidarity and compassion with victims and survivors of the recent extreme weather in many places around the world.\nIn Bangladesh and India, over 1,000 people died in an outsize monsoon flood. In the Caribbean and the United States, a succession of devastating hurricanes killed hundreds of people and cost thousands more their homes and businesses. In Hong Kong and southern China, over a dozen people were killed by a powerful typhoon.\nOf course, hurricanes, monsoons and other types of extreme weather are a part of life on earth for many. The trouble is that climate change is loading the dice by intensifying storms and making rain patterns less predictable.\nClimate change is the human thumb on the scale, pushing us toward disaster. It is not a distant danger \u2014 it is already with us. As we continue to burn fossil fuels, its effects will only grow.\nSome years ago I worked in Nigeria, helping to find peaceful solutions to conflicts. Its capital city, Lagos \u2014 one of the world\u2019s megacities, with a population estimated at 14 million to 21 million \u2014 will most likely experience a sea-level rise of around 35 inches in the next few decades if current warming trends continue.\nEven in this best-case scenario, which depends on the global community\u2019s sticking to the Paris climate change agreement, many of the shops I visited and homes I passed during my years in the country will be flooded. The rising waters are already changing ways of life and pressuring people to leave their homes. In the coming years, experts predict that millions of people in Lagos will be forced to move.\nProviding a welcoming home for these migrants will challenge all of us. Unfortunately, Nigeria is just one example of a highly populated, highly exposed coastal area facing rising sea levels and storm surges. Bangladesh, the Philippines and other South Asian countries join them. New York City, Rio de Janeiro and London are at risk as well.\nAs people of faith, we don\u2019t just state our beliefs \u2014 we live them out. One belief is that we find purpose and joy in loving our neighbors. Another is that we are charged by our creator with taking good care of his creation.\nThe moral crisis of climate change is an opportunity to find purpose and joy, and to respond to our creator\u2019s charge. Reducing the causes of climate change is essential to the life of faith. It is a way to love our neighbor and to steward the gift of creation.\nIndeed, even amid the hurricane-caused devastation and despair of recent weeks, I have seen seeds of hope. Different expressions of the Christian faith are freshly united around the need to care for our common home. The Catholic, Anglican and Orthodox Churches just came together with the World Council of Churches to celebrate a monthlong Season of Creation. During this season, people all around the globe prayed and acted to address climate change and to protect the earth.\nThe Anglican Communion is responding in many ways. Young Anglicans from across Africa have united with ecumenical neighbors to study local effects of climate change and work on developing local solutions. In Cape Town, a diocesan environmental working group held a Eucharist for creation on Table Mountain. In Canada, the national indigenous Anglican bishop participated in an online prayer service and led an interfaith walk to protect the Great Lakes.\nHowever we choose to respond, a response is necessary.\nPeople of faith have a unique call to address the causes of climate change. As we stand together in our support for the survivors of extreme weather, let us act together in ways that will safeguard our shared gift of creation \u2014 and the lives of those who will inherit it from us.",

Then Came the Deadly Floods.\n2017-09-07T14:21:22.000Z\nMURMALA, India \u2014 As the floodwaters sloshed into her hut, Phoolvati, a poor and landless woman living in a farming village in Bihar State, scrambled to grab some jewelry, a soccer ball and a wad of rupees \u2014 the last of the family\u2019s meager treasure. She hurriedly stuffed it all into a big aluminum box.\nMen from the village were rowing a small boat as fast as they could, to get people out before they drowned.\n\u201cTake this,\u201d she told her 10-year-old daughter, Bahomani. There wasn\u2019t enough room in the boat for everyone. \u201cI\u2019ll see you on the other side.\u201d\nPhoolvati watched as her daughter climbed in, clutching the box. The boat pushed off, nearly disappearing behind a wall of rain.\nNorthern India, one of the country\u2019s poorest regions, has been ravaged by some of the worst monsoon storms in recent years. Local officials pointed to a highway overpass about 15 feet above the ground and said that for the first time in living memory the water had risen above the bridge.\nIn a particularly severe season of storms and flooding around the world, the devastation in South Asia has been among the worst anywhere. The rains aren\u2019t over yet, and already in India, Nepal and Bangladesh, more than 1,200 people have lost their lives.\nSadly, this happens every year. Deadly flooding is part of the landscape in South Asia, and over the past two decades an average of around 2,000 people have died each year, according to the International Disaster Database in Belgium.\nBut even by South Asian standards, what began as a slow storm season is entering a particularly intense second half. And despite all of India\u2019s economic growth and the rapid infusion of mobile phones, computers, social media and other technology, millions of people in both rural and urban areas had no idea that dangerous weather was coming. Even some government officials said they had been given no warning.\nWalking through a string of villages in Bihar, the state that was worst hit this past month, the reek of fermenting grain cuts through the moist air. Sacks of rice from government warehouses had been left outside during the storms. Now inedible, the rice is full of dead worms.\nHundreds of thousands of displaced people now need that food. Across this area, more than 20,000 homes have been destroyed.\nHere in the village of Murmala, in a fertile farming area about an hour and half\u2019s drive from the nearest town, hundreds of displaced people are marooned in a closed-down, lightless middle school, getting chewed up by malarial mosquitoes.\nMany have no land of their own and eke out livings by working on other people\u2019s rice paddies. When the paddies are under several feet of water, there is no work.\nFor Abdul Rauf, a father of six, life has never been worse.\n\u201cWe did not buy any new clothes this Eid, and this has never happened before,\u201d he said, referring to the Muslim holiday last week. \u201cWe go to sleep hungry, unable to even fill our stomachs with water because the hand pumps are churning out such dirty water.\u201d\nThe Bihar State administration compensates families around $6,200 for each member killed in the floods. But for countless people the checks have not come or, in many instances, the names have been wrong.\nEvery year in South Asia, from June to September, the monsoon rains thunder down. July is often the worst month, but this year it wasn\u2019t so bad.\nPhoolvati, a gaunt woman with dark hair who estimates that she is around 50, remembers scanning the rich green rice paddies that surround her village in mid-August and smiling at her husband.\nThere is a lot of work out there, she told him. Soon we will have enough money to buy our daughter a bicycle. They believed the worst of the monsoon had passed.\nThe rainfall had been so light, actually, that government officials said they were even thinking of starting irrigation pumps.\nBut on Aug. 11, that changed. Dark clouds formed over the fields and it began to rain hard. For three days straight, it poured. This area lies just south of the India-Nepal border, and water coursing through Himalayan rivers had nowhere to go. Nepal opened a huge dam upriver, sending a torrent downstream.\n\u201cWe were taken completely by surprise,\u201d said Pankaj Dixit, a district magistrate, the government official who runs the local administration. \u201cWe had no information whatsoever from any agency about the rising water levels.\u201d\nAfsari, a mother of four, rushed out of her hut with her children to look for help. All of them were knocked down by the current. She tried to hold the hand of her youngest child, who was 2. Her grip slipped and her son was washed away.\nHer neighbor Mohammad Nayyar Alam is still furious, saying that the one government boat that finally showed up was \u201cuseless.\u201d The boat had space for seven people, he said, but five of the seats were taken by government officials.\n\u201cHow can it help the 400 families struggling to keep their heads above water then?\u201d he asked.\nAfsari spoke in near whispers outside her mildewed hut. She said she planned to use the $6,200 from her son\u2019s death to educate her three surviving children.  \u201cI want them to get out of this village,\u201d she said, an empty look in her eyes.\nWeather models predict that over the next 30 years India will experience more extreme rainfall.\nAsit K. Biswas, an environmental scientist and co-founder of the Third World Centre for Water Management in Mexico, said that India desperately needed better drainage systems. And he criticized politicians who complain about climate change without doing anything to help.\n\u201cIt then becomes an \u2018act of God,\u2019 and thus they are not responsible,\u201d he said. \u201cSadly, South Asia\u2019s water and flood problems are man-made, due to poor planning and management.\u201d\nMurmala and the villages around here would usually be buzzing with activity at this time, with people out working the paddies and fields, and children taking the dirt roads to and from school.\nThese villages are now concentrations of idleness, frustration, suffering and grief.\nOne older man limped around with a huge leaking boil on the inside of his thigh. He said he had been wading through waist-deep floodwater, filthy with garbage, for three days in an attempt to find his son. Eventually, he found him: The boy\u2019s body had washed up a couple of kilometers away.\nPhoolvati is still haunted by the image of her daughter, Bahomani, clutching the aluminum box with the family\u2019s valuables as the rickety rescue boat pushed away from her house. Phoolvati\u2019s husband was also in the boat.\nAs she watched, the wind whipped up, creating white caps on the water. The boat tipped over.\n\u201cI shouted. I was paralyzed,\u201d she remembered.\nThe water closed over her daughter and husband. Two days later, in a rice paddy, their bodies were found, intertwined. Bahomani was clinging to her father\u2019s neck.",

    "text": "\u2018I\u2019m Struggling to Survive\u2019: For Rohingya Women, Abuse Continues in Camps\n2017-12-23T21:30:28.000Z\nKUTUPALONG, Bangladesh \u2014 Rahima\u2019s father never wanted her out of his sight. She and her sister were too young, too pretty, too vulnerable to be trusted among the men of her village in western Myanmar, not to mention the soldiers who roamed the region.\n\u201cMy father would beat us if we dared to go out by ourselves, or he\u2019d beat our mother for allowing us to go out,\u201d said Rahima, a 15-year-old Rohingya Muslim. \u201cHe used to say there were bad men everywhere, and it was his duty to protect us.\u201d\nBut there was no protection for any of her family in September, when Myanmar troops burned their village in Rakhine State and sent them running for their lives. Her mother never made it out, her throat sliced by the blade of a Buddhist vigilante. Somewhere amid the chaos of flames, bullets and machetes, Rahima also lost her sister.\nThen, as Rahima ran through a forest on the way to neighboring Bangladesh, three uniformed Myanmar soldiers grabbed her. For two nights, they kept her in a jungle clearing and gang-raped her, smoking methamphetamine to sustain the torture, she said.\nRahima asked to be identified only by her first name. Today, she lives alone in Kutupalong, the world\u2019s largest refugee settlement, part of a sprawling network of camps in southeastern Bangladesh that has taken in more than 655,000 Rohingya since late August.\nThe assault is still imprinted on her face: a soldier\u2019s bite, each tooth mark indented, on the apple of her cheek.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why he bit me,\u201d Rahima said, her hand hovering over the scar. \u201cThere are many things I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\nDenied citizenship by Myanmar\u2019s government and targeted by what the United States calls ethnic cleansing, the Rohingya are among the most mistreated people on earth. And within this traumatized population, women are uniquely vulnerable. All too often, a Rohingya woman is fated to be passed, like chattel, from man to man \u2014 father to husband, soldier to sex trafficker \u2014 even in the supposed safety of the refugee camp.\nThe mostly stateless Rohingya have been sequestered and preyed upon by Myanmar\u2019s military for years. Human rights groups have long accused the Tatmadaw, as the country\u2019s security forces are known, of regular assault of Rohingya girls and women. (The security forces have been accused of that pattern with women of other ethnic minorities as well.)\nBut the latest campaign of gang rape against the Rohingya has been so brutal and systematic that Pramila Patten, a United Nations special representative on sexual violence in conflict, deemed it \u201ca calculated tool of terror aimed at the extermination and removal of the Rohingya as a group.\u201d\nMyanmar\u2019s government has denied any instances of sexual assault. Several officials have suggested that Rohingya women are too unattractive to merit attention from Tatmadaw soldiers.\nAs these survivors of sexual violence flood across the border into Bangladesh \u2014 the fastest outflow of refugees in a generation \u2014 they often arrive bruised and alone. Thousands of Rohingya men were killed on the spot or rounded up by Myanmar\u2019s soldiers, and some others are believed to have stayed behind to join the Rohingya insurgent movement.\nDoctors Without Borders estimated this month that at least 6,700 Rohingya men, women and children met violent deaths in Myanmar from late August to late September. Nearly 70 percent of the victims died of gunshot, the medical aid group said, adding that its mortality figure was almost certainly an underestimation.\nWith so many men missing, single mothers now head 17 percent of Rohingya households in refugee camps in Bangladesh, according to the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\nJanuwara\u2019s husband died in the village of Tula Toli, where hundreds of Rohingya are believed to have been massacred by the Tatmadaw in late August and early September. She escaped to Bangladesh with her 4-year-old daughter and 18-month-old niece, whose parents were also killed.\nHer story, like that of others, is based on her personal testimony but was vetted by international agencies and is consistent with accounts from other Rohingya.\nThere is no money to buy milk powder or other essentials, and the fact that the children are girls is \u201ca burden,\u201d said Ms. Januwara, who uses only one name.\n\u201cIf they were boys, I could send them out to work,\u201d she said. \u201cBut girls, all they can do is become servants when they reach 10 years old. Then they will only get enough money to feed themselves, not me.\u201d\nRahima, the girl scarred by a soldier\u2019s bite, has no one at all. Nobody else from her family made it to Bangladesh; her father, who had vowed to protect her at all costs, died of hepatitis before the soldiers\u2019 attack came.\nAlthough she is receiving some support from international aid groups like Save the Children, she fetches water and firewood on her own and jostles for handouts of rice and cooking oil.\n\u201cI know my father loved me very much, but because he was so restrictive I don\u2019t know how to do many normal things,\u201d Rahima said. \u201cI\u2019m struggling to survive.\u201d\nWith such a systematic campaign of rape in Myanmar, women and girls are arriving in Bangladesh pregnant from the attacks. Certain clinics report that they have quietly performed abortions, particularly for girls. But some clinics require consent from adult relatives before performing any procedures, and girls are often too embarrassed or ignorant to ask for help.\nFor Rohingya women, who rarely left their rural homes because of religious traditions, the density of the refugee camps can be disorienting.\n\u201cIn certain parts of the camps, you have 90,000 people living in one square kilometer, which means a complete lack of physical access to privacy,\u201d said Mohammed Abu Asaker, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency in Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard of women who are avoiding eating because they feel they don\u2019t have proper access to toilets. At the same time, women feel vulnerable about going alone to a forest to collect firewood, especially if they are dealing with the trauma of sexual violence.\u201d\nEven those women who left Myanmar with their families intact are not guaranteed security. Domestic abuse is rife among the Rohingya, say experts working in the camps \u2014 a product of both conservative customs and a society scarred by decades of state-sponsored violence and more recent displacement.\nOver one six-day period in October, United Nations staff recorded 306 incidents of gender-based violence in the camps. Of those attacks, 96 percent required a referral to emergency medical services, officials said.\n\u201cIn any refugee setting, we tend to see a rise in domestic violence because this is a pressured environment,\u201d said Fiona MacGregor, a public information officer in Cox\u2019s Bazar for the International Organization for Migration, a United Nations agency.\nRohingya men can be forthright about their impulses.\n\u201cOf course I beat my wife,\u201d said Sadrul Ameen, who arrived in a Bangladeshi refugee camp three months ago with his pregnant wife and child. Their other two children, he says, were killed in Myanmar, the 7-year-old stabbed in a rice paddy as the family fled.\n\u201cI beat my wife to keep her on track,\u201d Mr. Ameen added. \u201cI beat her if she does not listen to me. There are many reasons to beat her.\u201d\nMany Rohingya girls are forced to marry in their early teens, arranged marriages that tether them to much older men. While such child unions were historically common, their recent resurgence is partly a response to decades of persecution by Myanmar\u2019s military.\n\u201cChild marriage is a strategy adopted by the Rohingya community to prevent women from being raped by the Myanmar Army,\u201d said Lailufar Yasmin, a professor at the University of Dhaka who has studied Rohingya gender issues. \u201cThe community strategizes that if women are married in puberty and became pregnant immediately, they will be not be targeted by the army.\u201d\nProfessor Yasmin said that the high fertility rate among the Rohingya, which was estimated at 3.8 children per woman in 2012, was another survival mechanism.\n\u201cThe fear of going extinct makes the Rohingya community want women to get married at an early age and have as many children as possible,\u201d she said, acknowledging the role scant education and widespread poverty also play in driving large family sizes. \u201cThis is a highly patriarchal society, and they see only one role for women, which is the biological role, in which their value lies in producing the next generation.\u201d\nPregnancy and early marriage, however, were no defense against the Tatmadaw\u2019s recent campaign. And once victims of sexual violence reach the camps, they are particularly susceptible to the sex trade because they are seen by their families as damaged goods.\nAnother Rohingya woman, Rahima Khatun grew up in a refugee camp, part of an earlier wave of Rohingya who escaped to Bangladesh. Her story is as bleak as it is common. She married when she was 12. Her husband, far older than she, beat her and raped her, she said.\nA son was born, but when he was 2 months old, Ms. Khatun\u2019s husband left her for another wife \u2014 and another dowry, which funded his emigration to Malaysia. Never once did he send her money, she said.\nTo survive as a single mother, Ms. Khatun, now 21, works as a prostitute. Her customers aren\u2019t violent, for which she is grateful, she said, but they also refuse to use condoms. In a good day, she can earn $25, far more than her previous jobs sorting fish and grinding spices.\n\u201cEveryone has their self-respect, and no one will sell their body willingly,\u201d she said, as her 9-year-old boy sidled up and wrested her cellphone for a game of Candy Crush.\n\u201cI\u2019m doing all this for my son,\u201d Ms. Khatun said. \u201cI am lucky because he is not a girl.\u201d",

    "text": "How Disaster Charity Can Pivot to Sustainable Philanthropy\n2017-12-22T17:05:18.000Z\nThis has been a heavy year of natural disasters: Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, wildfires in California, the Mexico City earthquake, a monsoon in Bangladesh.\nIn the aftermath of any natural disaster, money rushes in to help those in need. The media attention prompts people to write checks but also to donate clothes, food and medicine.\nIt\u2019s well meaning \u2014 it\u2019s hard not to help people in the midst of a humanitarian crisis \u2014 but when the disaster passes from the news, people who give reactively, as an act of charity, turn their attention to something else.\nFor philanthropists who commit to difficult projects that last many years, the challenge of disasters is different. They need to find a way to maintain the momentum created by so much attention around a natural disaster to sustain long-term redevelopment. It\u2019s tricky turning charity into philanthropy.\nAfter all, Hurricane Harvey, which flooded Houston and drew charitable attention to the city, was not the first storm to wreak havoc on the area. Areas of Houston\u2019s flood zones have a one-in-500 chance of flooding, known as a 500-year flood. But the floods can happen back to back.\n\u201cFlooding is not new to Houston,\u201d said Marilu Hastings, vice president for sustainability programs at the Cynthia and George Mitchell Foundation, a nonprofit organization in Austin, Tex. \u201cHarvey was the third 500-year flood in three years. Now, we\u2019re thinking we need to change the standard for 500-year floods. It\u2019s a 50-year flood or less.\u201d\nBeth Gazley, a professor of public and environmental affairs at Indiana University, who studies disaster giving, said one certainty was that natural disasters occur every year, and people inclined to donate money to these causes should get into the habit of giving before they happen.\nTo prove her point on the ebb and flow of disaster donations, she pointed to the Red Cross\u2019s annual financial filings with the I.R.S. to show the impact of a year\u2019s hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, tsunamis and other destructive events on giving.\nDonations rose to more than $1 billion after the Haiti earthquake in 2010 and again after Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In years without such prominent disasters, donations dipped, to $741 million in 2011, and $788 million in 2013. In 2015, donations were $638 million.\nShe expects an uptick this year, but she said such patterns were \u201cnot how you build a sustainable organization.\u201d\nDonors, she said, should always give unrestricted gifts, so the money is used where it is needed most, and resist sending material goods. Giving cash means the charity can put that money to work right away, she said, adding, \u201cSometimes when people give stuff, they\u2019re just trying to empty out their garage.\u201d\n\u201cThe Red Cross\u2019s window of service is three days after a crisis \u2014 food, shelter and immediate humanitarian needs,\u201d Ms. Gazley said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to build everyone\u2019s houses 10-feet higher. When we focus on disaster charities, we\u2019re not focused on resilience.\u201d\nThat is where philanthropy comes in.\nThe prominence of wealthy local families can help bring a community together. Ms. Hastings said the Mitchell Foundation \u2014 whose money came from one of the pioneers of hydraulic fracturing \u2014 knew it needed to find partners to use philanthropy to protect Houston from future floods. It joined two other family foundations \u2014 the Kinder Foundation, whose money comes from Richard Kinder, who made his fortune in oil and gas pipelines; and the Houston Endowment, whose wealth traces back to Jesse and Mary Gibbs Jones, who built some of the city\u2019s first skyscrapers.\n\u201cThere are a lot of questions about why Houston floods \u2014 Is it the zoning? Is it how the city was built? \u2014 and there\u2019s a lot of finger-pointing,\u201d Ms. Hastings said. \u201cThose are good questions, but they don\u2019t move us forward. We\u2019re focused on solving problems.\u201d\nTo that end, the Houston Consortium, as the group is known, has brought together researchers to come up with suggestions for change, like new flood maps and reservoirs.\nThey are encouraged to understand the options quickly and share what they find. One requirement of the consortium\u2019s support is that the researchers collaborate and not keep their findings to publish years later in an academic journal.\nGiven the connections all three foundations have from the prominent families behind them, the consortium also hopes to put into practice what its research finds.\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the ground, and we have the relationships in the community,\u201d Ms. Hastings said. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s a matter of taking the longer view and putting together a rapid response that is more strategic than getting people food, shelter and clothing.\u201d\nMore difficult is turning that charitable impulse into a philanthropic quest from a distance. Effective disaster philanthropy, after all, requires the philanthropist to have the financial resources but also the contacts to make things happen.\nKenny Chesney, the country music star, is trying to show what can be assembled quickly. Watching from Nashville as Hurricane Irma bore down on St. John, the smallest of the three U.S. Virgin Islands, he said he felt helpless. He had been going to the island since before he was famous and he had close friends taking shelter on his estate on St. John.\nBefore he was able to make contact with anyone on St. John, he set up a foundation through a donor-advised fund \u2014 called Love for Love City \u2014 at Wells Fargo Private Bank. He brought on John McInnis, a friend who had worked on disaster cleanup after Hurricane Katrina.\n\u201cWhen you get past that anxiety state, and the reality of what had happened sinks in, that was why I wanted to start Love for Love City,\u201d Mr. Chesney said. \u201cI wanted to help as quickly as we could, but I also wanted to do it right.\u201d\nMr. Chesney would not disclose how much money he has contributed or his fans have donated, saying only that it was under $10 million. But what has allowed his effort to have influence beyond his celebrity is his partnership with other people with an interest in St. John to bring attention to the island.\nTwo of those were Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire philanthropist and former mayor of New York, and Tom Secunda, one of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s co-founders of Bloomberg L.P. Both had resources and connections that only billionaires and civic leaders could bring to bear.\n\u201cI was fortunate to know those guys and be a part of it all,\u201d Mr. Chesney said. \u201cI feel I\u2019m very lucky to have the ability and also the platform to help.\u201d\nHe said Mr. McInnis managed the day-to-day operations to ensure that money went where it was supposed to go.\n\u201cThe key is taking a very complicated situation and simplifying it,\u201d Mr. McInnis said. \u201cThe key beach bars and businesses that everyone loves will be up and going within the first six to 12 months. The beaches will be clean. There will be houses for people to rent and stay in.\u201d\nHe added that larger rebuilding of homes and resorts that were leveled is the second phase and will take several years. Yet Mr. Chesney, like the people behind the Houston Consortium, said his goal was to help rebuild the island in a way that made the infrastructure stronger. One of his goals was greater use of solar energy to bolster the electrical grid.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do my best through music and through my platform to raise as much awareness as I can and alleviate the stress and anxiety they\u2019re living under,\u201d Mr. Chesney said of the people on St. John. \u201cThe challenge is to keep having it in the psyche of people who really care about it.\u201d\nThat kind of thinking helps elevate the response to one disaster from charity to a more robust philanthropic project.",

    "text": "Tastes That Are Distinctly Bangladeshi in Queens\n2017-10-26T15:50:44.000Z\nIt is time to praise the Bangladeshi steam table, with its crammed bins, trays, casserole dishes and china bowls; its stacks of cilantro-flecked kebabs as long as hot dogs; its rolling mountains of rice in sepia and saffron, studded with whole peeled hard-boiled eggs and looking ready to tumble.\nSuch is the vision of food without end that greets you at Boishakhi in Astoria, Queens, which was among the first neighborhoods settled by Bangladeshi immigrants starting in the 1970s. For decades, the city\u2019s Bangladeshi restaurants were nearly indistinguishable from more blurrily subcontinental ones, kitchens churning out chicken tikka masala and murky thatches of saag paneer. Here, a half-block from Masjid el-Ber, the local mosque, the flavors are distinct to the Bay of Bengal.\nWhat I craved most was shutki vorta, a rough crush of little dried fish that start out as hard and skinny as licorice and are broken down just enough to grow soft and slightly fluffy. It\u2019s a small, briny cloud, with swift jabs of chile and a leavening bite of cilantro, that tastes as much of the sun as of the depths.\nThere is fresh fish, too, above all hilsa, which lives in the sea but breeds in rivers and is said to taste best when caught in freshwater. Oily and rich like shad, it is the fish of weddings and meals for heads of state, and eaten at breakfast on Pohela Boishakh, Bengali New Year\u2019s Day. (The restaurant\u2019s name is a salute to the New Year\u2019s spirit of celebration.)\nOn the steam table, hilsa is served alongside tilapia and rui, a member of the carp family, clean and delicate. They might come curried and strewn with creamy flat beans; or gently stewed with trunks of eggplant; or swarmed twice over with onions, one batch charred until swampily sweet and a second batch tossed in late so the flavor stays keen.\nThe chef, Shahara Khan, has roots in Narsingdi, just outside of Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital. She spent years cooking at other restaurants in Queens while dreaming of her own, and opened Boishakhi two years ago with the help of her son, Tozammel Tanzil; her daughter, Shamsun Rimi; and Ms. Rimi\u2019s husband, Abu Taher Atip.\nShe keeps the steam table stocked with scarlet-tinged goat curry \u2014 the meat still clinging to nubs of bone, not yet reconciled to submitting to the teeth \u2014 and tabs of beef stomach that tug and slip. Goat hunks bob in a loose dal, and more are buried in kacchi biryani, which is offered only a few days a week because it takes five hours to make, the meat and rice layered raw and cooked under a lid sealed with dough, so no heat escapes.\nFor balance, there are unfussy heaps of gutted string beans, potato strips fried to shining but not stiffness, and carrots and cabbage halfway between collapse and crunch. And more vortas (mashes), including potato scooped like ice cream, with flares of red onion and stray chile seeds, and eggplant brought almost to a burn, for lingering smoke.\nChile brings an insistent thrust to every dish, sometimes a scorch and quick retreat, sometimes a steady radiance. Whole green chiles are available on request and arrive in small saucers to sear the palate clean.\nBoishakhi is more cafeteria than restaurant. Diners point to what they want, then find spots on banquettes. The menu is spoken only; for those unfamiliar with the cuisine, the servers will patiently name each dish and occasionally attempt to deflect interest. (Regarding hilsa: \u201ctoo many bones.\u201d)\nDiners find spots on banquettes along the unadorned walls to wait for their food, which is presented on a mix of china and paper plates. (Mine always came with a tiny iceberg lettuce salad on the side, shrouded in plastic wrap.) A larger room downstairs, lit by chandeliers that shift from purple to pink, is reserved for parties or offered to women who feel more comfortable dining unseen by men they do not know.\nDesserts await unlabeled in the freezer case. One night, a young man shook his head at what I\u2019d chosen and reached in for a bin of mishti doi, milk boiled and thickened, stained orange by caramelized sugar and left to ferment overnight. It was tangy and sweet, each flavor holding the other in check, and my spoon carved into it as if it were cheesecake.\nFollow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

    "text": "Rex Tillerson Tells Myanmar Leaders to Investigate Attacks on Rohingya\n2017-11-15T10:19:08.000Z\nNAYPYIDAW, Myanmar \u2014 Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson briefly visited Myanmar on Wednesday and urged its two most influential leaders to investigate \u201ccredible reports of widespread atrocities\u201d by the country\u2019s security forces against Rohingya Muslims.\nIn a five-hour visit in Myanmar, Mr. Tillerson met with Sr. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the nation\u2019s military commander, and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate and head of the country\u2019s civilian government. He urged both to investigate and halt the violence that has driven more than 615,000 Rohingya to flee over the border to Bangladesh since late August. Less than one-third of the 1.1 million Rohingya who lived in Myanmar last year are thought to remain in the country.\nMr. Tillerson called the situation \u201chorrific,\u201d and at a news conference after the meeting said that there had been \u201ccrimes against humanity.\u201d And while he said he advised against \u201cbroad-based economic sanctions\u201d against Myanmar, he said targeted sanctions against individuals might be called for.\nMembers of the mostly stateless Muslim minority are still flooding into Bangladesh from Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine State. They bring with them accounts of villages burned to the ground, women raped and children flung into fires. The accounts have been borne out by human rights investigators and, in the case of the villages, satellite evidence.\nA senior United Nations official has called the campaign against the Rohingya a \u201ctextbook example of ethnic cleansing.\u201d And on Sunday, Pramila Patten, a special representative of the United Nations secretary general, accused the Myanmar military of systematic sexual violence against the Rohingya, noting that rape is a weapon of genocide.\n\u201cThe key test of any democracy is how it treats its most vulnerable and marginalized populations,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said in Naypyidaw, the capital. \u201cIt is the responsibility of the government and the security forces to protect and respect the human rights of all persons within its borders and to hold accountable those who fail to do so.\u201d\nBut Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has defended Myanmar\u2019s security forces, saying that there should be an investigation into what caused the Rohingya crisis. \u201cWe want to find out why this exodus is happening,\u201d she said in a speech in September.\nGiven the widespread testimony from Rohingya refugees about what led them to flee, critics have accused the Nobel laureate of disingenuousness.\nAt the news conference on Wednesday, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi defended her statements, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know why people say I\u2019ve been silent\u201d about the Rohingya, and suggesting that perhaps what she has said was not \u201cinteresting enough\u201d or \u201cincendiary.\u201d She thanked Mr. Tillerson for having \u201can open mind.\u201d\n\u201cAn open mind is something very rare these days,\u201d she added.\nLast month, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi \u2014 who as a civilian leader has no authority over Myanmar\u2019s powerful military, which ruled for nearly half a century \u2014 set up yet another commission dedicated to the Rohingya emergency. There are now at least five such panels, and Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi presides over most of them.\nYet members of her government admit they have not sent any investigators to Bangladesh to listen to the Rohingya\u2019s accounts. Human rights groups fear that, at a minimum, hundreds of Rohingya civilians have been killed. But with international investigators prevented from freely accessing northern Rakhine, evidence is scarce.\nMyanmar\u2019s minister for social welfare, Dr. Win Myat Aye, who is involved in four of the government\u2019s Rohingya commissions, said on Wednesday that he was wary of accusing the military of any atrocities.\n\u201cWe always used to hear that the military was violating human rights,\u201d said the veteran member of the National League for Democracy, whose leaders were jailed and persecuted by the military for decades before they entered a power-sharing government with the army last year. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know if these allegations in Rakhine are true or not because I haven\u2019t seen it myself and it\u2019s beyond my capacity.\u201d\nOn Monday, the Myanmar military released the results of a monthlong internal investigation that cleared the army of any abuses against Rohingya civilians. Instead, the Tatmadaw, as the Myanmar armed forces are known, blamed Rohingya \u201cterrorists\u201d for violence in Rakhine.\nThe latest military operation, like an earlier campaign last year, began after Rohingya insurgents attacked security outposts in Rakhine, killing Myanmar forces.\nThe Tatmadaw\u2019s internal report maintained that soldiers had not targeted any fleeing women or children, a claim disputed by refugees now sheltering in Bangladesh. The inquiry also said that when shooting suspected insurgents, Myanmar forces made sure to only aim below their knees.\nEfforts by the United Nations to scrutinize that first wave of violence last year have been foiled by the Myanmar authorities, who have denied United Nations investigators visas to enter the country.\nWith many of the Rohingya still making the perilous journey to Bangladesh, rights groups fear that there will soon be barely any left in Myanmar, apart from the 120,000 who have been forced into internment camps in central Rakhine.\nOn Monday, the spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain said that the campaign against the Rohingya had been \u201ccreated by the Burmese military and it looks like ethnic cleansing.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, in conjunction with Fortify Rights, a human rights watchdog, released a report with allegations of \u201cmounting evidence\u201d of genocide against the Rohingya.\nMembers of Congress have proposed imposing sanctions on those in Myanmar who have orchestrated the military crusade against the Rohingya. Earlier sanctions were lifted as the military-dominated regime began transferring some power to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s party.\nOn Monday, leaders who had gathered for an Asia-Pacific summit meeting in Manila, including President Trump, declined to issue a forceful condemnation of Myanmar for its treatment of the Rohingya.\nHuman-rights groups have urged Myanmar to end decades of systematic persecution of the Rohingya and to give them citizenship. Although members of the Muslim minority have lived in Rakhine for generations, the official stance in Naypyidaw is that they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.\nLast month, the United Nations, which has been accused by Myanmar officials of supporting Rohingya militants, was told that it would be allowed to resume humanitarian assistance to desperate and hungry communities trapped in northern Rakhine. But only a trickle of aid has been allowed in so far.\nMeanwhile, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s various Rohingya commissions are continuing their work.\n\u201cWe are trying our best to find a solution,\u201d said Dr. Win Myat Aye, the social affairs minister. \u201cBut so far, there is still no way to solve the problem.\u201d",

    "text": "Bangladeshi Flavors Alongside Burgers and Chicken at Neerob\n2017-03-30T17:08:32.000Z\nLast spring, on the street known as Bangla Bazaar in the Parkchester section of the Bronx, the Bangladeshi restaurant Neerob \u2014 thought by many to be the city\u2019s best \u2014 vanished.\nAnother Bangladeshi restaurant stands in its place, a source of confusion for some pilgrims who step off the No. 6 train at the Castle Hill Avenue stop and make their way to that strip of halal meat markets and threading salons. But Neerob\u2019s presiding spirit, Mohammed Rahman, whom friends and regulars call Khokon, is gone.\nFortunately, he can be found a few blocks away, in an equally utilitarian space on Westchester Avenue that was once home to a 99-cent store. There, a year and a half ago, he opened Packsun Halal Chicken with a resolutely American menu of rotisserie and fried chicken and burgers, along with the occasional pakora.\nSoon after, he split with his business partner in the Bangla Bazaar space. He took the Neerob name with him and unfurled it in Packsun\u2019s window to the delight of customers who had been chiding him for the lack of Bangladeshi dishes.\nHis head chef from the original Neerob, Mohammed Islam, is in the kitchen now. And the steam table is loaded three rows deep, with more platters crowded on top: whole fish bronzed with turmeric, under kinked ribbons of caramelized onions; small curls of shrimp peeking from a dark thicket of spinach; shutki, sun-dried fish hardly the length of a finger, broken down in a pan with eggplant just enough that you can still taste the eggplant\u2019s meatiness and feel the crunch of tiny bones.\nSome of the most profound flavors come in the side dishes, like a thick, jet-black mash of kali jira seeds, better known in the West as nigella. The taste of the seeds is delicate, a faint suggestion of charred onion and fennel. Over this snaps the electric current of mustard oil, with a sting that is neither quite flavor nor fragrance, blossoming inside the nose and under the eyes.\nThe bounty changes daily. If you\u2019re in luck, there may be khichuri, hunks of goat and hard-boiled eggs stained pink in a velvety meld of rice and moong dal. Or chicken roast, named for its status as the center of a feast rather than its preparation: pan-fried and simmered in a creamy masala that\u2019s a happy feud of sweet and hot.\nNone of the dishes are labeled, but the women behind the counter patiently identify in English what ingredients they can, while their male colleagues greet customers with \u201cYes, brother\u201d and warn those not of South Asian heritage against the omnipresent chiles.\nA mango lassi proves the best redress for the heat, as does the ever-changing array of sweets: beautiful nokshi pitha, rounds of rice-powder dough carved by hand with a wooden needle (traditionally a thorn from a date palm tree); misti nimki, bands of fried dough like chewy pie crust, shining from sugar syrup; and rosgolla, orbs of sweetened curds, yielding to the teeth without a squeak.\nThe dining room is not exactly cozy, yet people linger. On the walls hang framed newspaper articles singing the praises of the first Neerob. An A.T.M. sits in a corner; a TV mutters. Signs in unexpected places deliver mantras like \u201cEnjoy the little things,\u201d and pakoras may appear, unbidden, at the start of your meal, along with an iceberg lettuce salad that would be perfunctory but for its topping of whole green chiles.\nMr. Rahman left Dhaka, Bangladesh, for New York 25 years ago at 19. Only a few thousand Bangladeshi immigrants lived in the city then. By 2009, when he opened Neerob on Bangla Bazaar, the population had grown tenfold.\nHe still remembers one of his first jobs, washing dishes at an Indian restaurant run, like many in the city, by a Bangladeshi immigrant. He asked his boss, \u201cHow come you make another country\u2019s food?\u201d The reply: \u201cNobody knows Bangladesh.\u201d Mr. Rahman decided to prove him wrong.\nMeanwhile, the fried chicken has not been forgotten. One night, a group of young men of Bangladeshi descent sat devouring it. I asked if the halal version was better than standard American fried chicken. (I had tried it myself and found it respectably crispy, if underspiced.)\n\u201cNot really,\u201d one said. \u201cIt\u2019s just how the chicken was killed.\u201d His friends nodded, all but one, who looked down at his plate and said shyly, \u201cI think it\u2019s better.\u201d\nFollow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

    "text": "Why Do Bangladeshis Seem Indifferent to Partition?\n2017-08-16T10:29:59.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 In 1948, a year after the partition of India, my maternal grandparents moved from Calcutta to Dhaka, crossing from West Bengal in India to East Bengal, or East Pakistan \u2014 now Bangladesh. There, they built a tin-shed house in the new neighborhood of Dhanmondi, known before only for its paddy fields (dhan). At the time, the area was so desolate that every night my grandfather would fire his double-barreled shotgun to ward off foxes and thieves.\nTwo years later, he built the first brick and concrete house in the area, which soon enough filled up with one- and two-story bungalows, each with its own lawn. His house looked no different from the others, but it harbored a surprising secret: He had built it with a foundation that could support seven stories. As far back as 1950, he had told my grandmother, \u201cA day will come when you won\u2019t be able to see anything but people in this city.\u201d And indeed, while at some point other lovely houses in the neighborhood had to be torn down in order to be built back up taller, his children just added new floors.\nWhen I was growing up, such stories struck me as nothing more than proof that my grandfather was eccentric and a visionary. But how we fashion our family history also reflects our collective memory. And when years later I began to examine, for a research project in comparative literature, why Bangladeshis relate to partition differently than do Indians and Pakistanis, I found clues to an answer right in my family lore.\nMost Indians and Pakistanis look at partition as an enduring tragedy and with an overwhelming sense of sadness. The event is lamented for its tremendous violence and its deaths, and marks the loss of territory and homes. For Indians and Pakistanis, it also represents the abrupt truncating of a sense of self. British colonialism had hoped to unite regional groups from Afghanistan to the edge of Burma under a broader national, perhaps civilizational, \u201cIndian\u201d identity. The advent of a separate state for Pakistan announced that project\u2019s defeat.\nIn contrast, Bangladeshis\u2019 response to partition can seem to verge on indifference. For us, Aug. 15, the day of India\u2019s independence in 1947, represents first and foremost the brutal murder many years later, in 1975, of our own founding father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Our seminal historical event is the Liberation War of 1971, during which up to three million Bangladeshis may have been killed by the Pakistani Army and its local collaborators as they tried to crush the movement for independence.\nSome argue that the enormity of that later war suborned the memory of the earlier split. This may be true, but it is not the entire story.\nThe Liberation War of Bangladesh is indeed the most momentous event for the people who were once East Bengalis, then East Pakistanis and now Bangladeshis: It conferred on us the pride of standing as an equal among the nations of the world. Other subnational groups in both India and Pakistan also chafed at the gross inequities committed by an imposing federated state. Yet only in Bangladesh did rebellion against such injustice and the idea of a distinct cultural identity \u2014 in this case, Bengali and secular \u2014 lead to a new nation.\nBut partition had paved the way. So while the importance of 1971 cannot be overstressed for Bangladeshis, to think that partition has only been subsumed here by a bigger and more recent event also misses the point.\nTo explain, allow me to return to the story of my family \u2014 a story similar to that of many other Muslim families who arrived from the other side of the border.\nYou see, my grandparents, two Muslims living in Hindu-majority West Bengal, did not move to East Bengal out of fear. My grandmother came from a large and prosperous clan in a town adjacent to Calcutta. She recalled that during religious riots in 1946, men in her neighborhood guarded all its entrances, wielding swords. As Muslims who held a dominant position in their Muslim-majority corner of town, my grandparents didn\u2019t face the terrible violence of the time.\nBut if they felt secure enough even then, why leave a year after partition? The answer is quite simple: To them, East Pakistan was not a land of exile, but a land of opportunity.\nThe contrast in the fortunes of my ancestors who moved to Dhaka versus those who stayed back in Calcutta is telling. My grandparents\u2019 children in Bangladesh have gone on to hold high offices at home and even internationally. The ones who entered business have enjoyed tremendous success. Their cousins in Calcutta, who are a minority there today, enjoy prosperous middle-class lives, mainly running small businesses. No one approaches the exalted heights reached by their relatives in the new country, or local Hindus with comparable job qualifications.\nYet to write off the difference simply as a function of a majoritarian advantage is to miss a subtler point about who made the move and why. Many Hindus of East Bengal had good reason to fear for their safety after horrific riots and rapes against them there in the late 1940s. But many of the Muslims of West Bengal, especially the more privileged ones, who crossed into East Pakistan were often the more ambitious members of their families and came into the new country to seek new fortunes.\nOf the 15 million people who crossed the borders of Bengal and Punjab, in western India, at the time of partition, only 700,000 moved to East Bengal, most of them from West Bengal, with smaller numbers from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Bengali Muslims suffered less violence than other groups. For many of them the move was voluntary, indeed opportunistic. And their hope of a better future, rather than the mere search for a safe haven, has given rise to a different kind of memory about that period: one less laden with grief and often taut with the excitement of new possibilities.\nOf course, even those Bengali Muslims experienced some longing for what they had left behind. My grandmother would recount fondly her uncle taking her to the tearoom Flurys, a Calcutta landmark. Some of our relatives from the city swapped homes with the famous Bengali poet Buddhadev Bose in Dhaka. Later in school, I read Bose\u2019s mesmerizing account of the monsoon rains beating down on his tin-roof house, but my relatives who took up residence there remained homesick for Calcutta. Their gentle nostalgia and my grandmother\u2019s and that of other displaced Bengali Muslims is part of our muted history, and part of why our history is muted.\nSeven decades on, partition may be a bigger psychic presence for Indians and Pakistanis than it was in years closer to the event. For Bangladeshis, who tend to gloss over its brutality as a pathology of the moment, it is but an echo of the distant past.",

    "text": "Bangladeshi Assault Kills 2 Militants but Fails to End Standoff\n2017-03-26T19:19:42.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Bangladeshi troops using armored vehicles and firing bullets and tear gas assaulted an apartment house on Sunday in the northeastern city of Sylhet, killing two of the militants besieged in the building, the authorities said.\nBut the troops did not succeed in ending a violent three-day standoff that has left six other people dead, including two police officers, and has injured at least 43.\nZedan Al Musa, an additional deputy commissioner of the Sylhet Metropolitan Police, said in a telephone interview that the injured included two officers of the army\u2019s antiterrorism Rapid Action Battalion, including its director of intelligence, Lt. Col. Abul Kalam Azad.\nA spokesman for the battalion, Cmdr. Mufti Mahmud Khan, said on Sunday that Colonel Azad was in critical condition and had been flown to Singapore for treatment.\nThe six deaths and most of the injuries, including those to the colonel, occurred Saturday night, Commissioner Musa said, when two explosions were set off by motorcycle-riding militants at a checkpoint about 400 yards from the apartment building, where a crowd had gathered.\nThe Islamic State claimed responsibility on social media \u201cfor a bombing on Bangladeshi forces in Sylhet,\u201d according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist communications.\nBangladesh\u2019s elite police forces have been trying to crack down on militant groups since a deadly attack on a restaurant last year, arresting and sometimes killing suspected militants. The small-scale attacks that had become commonplace in the country in recent years have largely stopped.\nReports of attacks on religious minorities have increased in recent weeks, though, including the killings of a Sufi spiritual leader and his daughter and an attack on a Bangladeshi Christian. So far, neither crime has been officially linked to extremists.\nThe Sylhet siege follows a week of botched suicide bombings in Dhaka. A man detonated explosives on Friday at a police checkpoint near the international airport in Dhaka, killing only himself, the police said. The Islamic State claimed responsibility.\nMr. Musa said the police began the Sylhet operation Thursday night, when they received word that militants were hiding on the ground floor of the five-story building on the edge of the city.\nHe said officers cordoned off the building that evening, and were joined Friday by a specially trained police unit from Dhaka. More than 70 residents of the building were evacuated that day, he said, and army commandos took over the operation Saturday.\nBrig. Gen. Fakhrul Ahsan said in a televised news conference that the militants had small arms, explosives and suicide vests, and had planted improvised explosive devices in the building.\n\u201cThey are well trained, and have thrown back the grenades we lobbed at them,\u201d he said.\nArmy commandos led the assault on Sunday, General Ahsan said. The two militants killed were wearing suicide vests, and one of them managed to set his off, the general said, adding that one or two more militants were believed to still be in the building.\n\u201cThe operation will take more time,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are risks involved, and we are not in any hurry.\u201d",

    "text": "Refugees\u2019 Flight and Land Mines Spur Bangladesh Protest to Myanmar\n2017-09-06T17:02:16.000Z\nCOX\u2019S BAZAR, Bangladesh \u2014 Bangladesh on Wednesday protested the huge influx of people fleeing violence in Myanmar and raised concerns with Myanmar\u2019s government about reports that its military was placing land mines along the countries\u2019 shared border.\nBangladesh \u201cdemanded immediate measures from Myanmar to de-escalate the ongoing violence,\u201d according to a statement from the Bangladesh Foreign Ministry.\nManjurul Karim Khan Chowdhury, director general for Southeast Asia for the Foreign Ministry, issued the protest on Wednesday to Aung Myint, charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires of the Myanmar Embassy in Dhaka.\nMyanmar\u2019s government did not issue an immediate response. Zaw Htay, a spokesman for its de facto leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, questioned who was responsible for the land mines in comments this week to Reuters, which first reported Bangladesh\u2019s allegations. \u201cWho can surely say those mines were not laid by the terrorists?\u201d he asked.\nMore than 146,000 people are believed to have crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh since late last month, according to the United Nations.\nNearly all are ethnic Rohingya, a Muslim group that has long faced oppression and denial of citizenship rights in Buddhist-majority Myanmar. The surge across the border followed Aug. 25 attacks by a Rohingya militant group on police stations and a military base in Rakhine State.\nRohingya witnesses who have reached Bangladesh say that the military and vigilante mobs of ethnic Rakhine have torched dozens of villages and sprayed bullets at fleeing residents. Satellite photos have shown many fires in the area, which is unusual given the current monsoon conditions, Human Rights Watch said.\nAt least 15 members of the Myanmar security forces and 370 members of the militant group have been killed, the government says.\nThe violence has touched off an exodus of desperate people, carrying children and scant possessions as they cross the border on foot. Land mines have increased their risk.\nOne woman was injured in a land mine explosion Monday, and two siblings were hurt in another blast Tuesday, said Maj. Iqbal Ahmed of the Border Guard Bangladesh. Another two children were injured slightly when a group of Rohingya spotted land mines and threw something to set them off, he said.\nThe explosions occurred on Myanmar\u2019s side of the border, Major Ahmed added. He would not comment on whether the mines were laid by the Myanmar military.\nAt the government-run Sadar Hospital in Cox\u2019s Bazar, some of the Rohingya who had been admitted \u201chad injuries consistent with land mine explosions,\u201d said Dr. Shaheen Abdur Rahman Chowdhury, the resident medical officer.\nOne of the injured, Hobaid, who uses one name, was admitted to Sadar Hospital with a gunshot wound in the chest and land mine injuries.\nHe was hurt Friday in Maungdaw Township in Myanmar, near the Bangladeshi border crossing of Tumbru, his brother Kojail said. Three men were killed when the land mine exploded, and four were injured, Kojail said.\n\u201cWhat is happening to our people is monstrous,\u201d said their father, Aktar Hussan, 70. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if things will ever get better. All we can do is to rely on almighty Allah.\u201d\nThe Myanmar military has, for decades, been accused of using land mines in conflicts with ethnic armies. Myanmar is one of 35 countries that have not joined an international treaty banning antipersonnel mines. Rebel militias, like the Kachin Independence Army in Myanmar\u2019s north, have also been accused of using land mines. Civilians are often the victims.\nIn addition to land mines, people trying to cross the border face other dangers. Last week, at least 46 Rohingya died when their boats sank while crossing a river between the two countries.\nEven for those who have crossed safely into Bangladesh, grim conditions await. The Bangladesh government estimated that 400,000 Rohingya refugees were already in the country before the latest influx began.\nThe arrival of so many people in such a short time has put aid groups under extreme pressure, and camps for them at a \u201cbreaking point\u201d because of a lack of space, Duniya Aslam Khan, spokeswoman for the United Nations\u2019 refugee agency, said Tuesday.\n\u201cThose who have made it to Bangladesh are in poor condition,\u201d she added. \u201cMost have walked for days from their villages \u2014 hiding in jungles, crossing mountains and rivers with what they could salvage from their homes. They are hungry, weak and sick.\u201d\nRohingya who remain in Rakhine State in Myanmar face an even bleaker picture, aid groups say, with dwindling food and continuing military raids on their villages. The Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, the Rohingya militant group that claimed responsibility for the Aug. 25 attacks, has also blocked some men and boys from leaving, refugees in Bangladesh said.\nThe government of Myanmar said Wednesday that more than 26,000 people had been displaced in Rakhine State, but that figure does not include Rohingya civilians.\nThe government of Myanmar has denied that its military is attacking civilians in Rakhine State. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said Tuesday that security forces were carrying out a campaign against terrorists while protecting residents of the area.\n\u201cWe know very well, more than most, what it means to be deprived of human rights and democratic protection,\u201d she said during a phone call with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, according to her office. \u201cSo we make sure that all the people in our country are entitled to protection of their rights as well as the right to, and not just political, but social and humanitarian defense.\u201d\nMr. Erdogan, who last week called the violence against the Rohingya \u201cgenocide,\u201d told her the humanitarian crisis was rousing public anger, Turkish news media reported. Turkey later announced it would send aid to Rakhine State.\nGovernments from several other predominantly Muslim countries, including Pakistan, Malaysia and Indonesia, have also expressed concern. Malala Yousafzai of Pakistan, the youngest Nobel Peace Prize laureate, also confronted Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi on Twitter.\nMs. Aung San Suu Kyi complained to Mr. Erdogan of \u201ca huge iceberg of misinformation calculated to create a lot of problems between different communities and with the aim of promoting the interest of the terrorists.\u201d\nMehmet Simsek, the deputy prime minister of Turkey, posted last month on Twitter that the world was \u201cturning a blind eye to ethnic cleansing\u201d in Myanmar. Among the photos he posted were some from other events and other countries.\nA sea of unverified postings have purported to show bloodshed in Rakhine State. Large numbers of recently created Twitter accounts have also hurled abuse at reporters and staff members of nongovernmental organizations posting anything seen as sympathetic toward the Rohingya or playing down the violence of the Rohingya militants.",

    "text": "Blinded by Her Husband, She Fights for Justice (and Aces Law School)\n2017-12-08T17:22:45.000Z\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia \u2014 During the summer break from her graduate studies in Canada, Rumana Monzur returned home to Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, to tell her husband she wanted a divorce. He reacted with leaden silence.\nBut a few hours later, he strode into the room where she was working on her thesis, locked the door and pinned her down on the bed. Then he dug his fingers into her eyes, blinding her. He also bit off the tip of her nose, and tore flesh from her cheeks and her right arm.\n\u201cI won\u2019t let you be someone else\u2019s and I won\u2019t let you study,\u201d she recalled him saying as their terrified 5-year-old daughter tried to pull him off Ms. Monzur\u2019s chest. \u201cHe told me in a hissing voice, \u2018I wanted to kill you with acid, but good for you, I couldn\u2019t find any.\u2019\u201d\nIn the days and weeks after, Ms. Monzur endured multiple surgeries and a smear campaign by her husband and his family, who tried to paint her as the aggressor in the attack. Refusing to stay silent, Ms. Monzur demanded justice from her hospital bed.\nThe savage assault and her outspoken defiance of female victimization made headlines in Bangladesh and Canada, galvanizing public support that prompted the Canadian government to allow Ms. Monzur to immigrate with her daughter and parents in 2011.\nAnd here in Vancouver she again garnered attention in the news media, earning a master\u2019s degree from the University of British Columbia in 2013. This year she graduated from the university\u2019s law school. Today, she is studying for the bar exam while working at DLA Piper, a prominent law firm.\nAs reports about the abuse of male power have left much of the West reeling, Ms. Monzur\u2019s story underscores the grave perils faced by women in the developing world who dare to challenge men\u2019s authority, and the strength it takes to fight back.\nSitting in a conference room at the law firm high above downtown Vancouver, her sightless eyes concealed by golden contact lenses, Ms. Monzur, 39, recounted how a passion for education drove her to escape her abusive marriage and rebuild her life in Canada.\nMs. Monzur grew up in a moderate Muslim family, the daughter of a retired Bangladeshi army officer who had five sisters, all highly educated.\n\u201cMy family taught me to be ambitious,\u201d she said. Marriage was not something she had ever thought much about, she said. But she agreed to marry Hasan Syeed, the son of a friend of her father\u2019s, while she was studying international relations at the University of Dhaka.\nHe began abusing her on their wedding night in 2000, she said, slapping her right after they had moved into his parents\u2019 home. Her offense was asking why he and his family had arrived so late to the ceremony.\nIn hindsight, Ms. Monzur said, she should have left him immediately, but as a young bride in a conservative culture she blamed herself and chose to endure his beatings rather than face the stigma of divorce.\nAs she obtained her first master\u2019s degree in Dhaka and became an assistant professor, she suffered quietly when he hit and kicked her, shoved her into furniture and dragged her across the floor by her hair. His parents ignored the abuse or told her to be a good wife and forgive him. \u201cI felt like I was in prison,\u201d she said.\nSometimes he was \u201cnormal\u201d toward her, she said, and during one of those brief periods, their daughter was conceived. After she gave birth, however, she moved back in with her parents. She never lived with her husband again, but remained legally married to avoid his wrath and societal opprobrium.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know if I would be able to face society or what kind of stigma my daughter would face,\u201d Ms. Monzur said. \u201cI also thought it was a shame for me. Now I know it\u2019s those people who inflict harm on others who should be ashamed.\u201d\nEager to get away, in 2010, she enrolled in a political science master\u2019s degree program at the University of British Columbia. Life in Vancouver gave her a newfound sense of freedom and with it, the resolve to get a divorce.\n\u201cI just loved that I wasn\u2019t with him and could focus on my studies,\u201d she said.\nYet he continued to terrorize her from afar with phone calls, often in the middle of the night, accusing her of infidelity and threatening to take away their daughter.\nMs. Monzur informed her husband their marriage was over while on a visit home in June 2011. He fled the bloody attack after leaving her blinded.\n\u201cThere was so much internal bleeding in my eyes, it\u2019s a miracle I\u2019m still alive,\u201d she said.\nHer family reported the attack to the police, but they were concerned for her reputation if the incident became public. Outraged relatives and colleagues, however, took to social media and encouraged her to speak out. Ms. Monzur, her eyes swollen shut and nose bandaged, described the attack in a television news interview from her hospital bed, the first of several that received international news media coverage.\nSupporters held rallies demanding justice, yet she said the publicity also elicited a flood of threats and scorn. When her husband was caught two days later, he accused her of having an affair in Canada and trying to kill him with sleeping pills, while his parents claimed she was pretending to be blind.\nAfter he died of a heart attack while in jail awaiting trial that December, his relatives told journalists Ms. Monzur conspired to have him killed.\nBy that time, Ms. Monzur had resettled in Vancouver, but was struggling with her disability.\n\u201cSchool was my comfort zone,\u201d she said. University friends helped her to do research and transcribed her successful master\u2019s thesis. Then she announced she wanted to take the law school entrance exam. \u201cEveryone thought it was ridiculous,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m stubborn, so the best way to make me work is to say, \u2018Rumana, you can\u2019t do it.\u2019\u201d\nA year after losing her sight, she took the law school exam using magnetic letters and numbers, pipe cleaners and her bangles to answer questions and draw diagrams.\nAfter her first year of law school, she had a summer internship with DLA Piper, which led to a full-time job. Ms. Monzur is aided by software that translates text to speech, allowing her to do the same legal research and litigation any new lawyer must tackle.\n\u201cRumana doesn\u2019t do anything different but she does it differently,\u201d said Mary Ruhl, the firm\u2019s director of professional development. \u201cShe makes it seem easy but I know it\u2019s not.\u201d\nStill, Ms. Monzur\u2019s blindness presents obstacles. She cannot witness a will, examine photos or sign documents, so in those instances, the firm brings in other lawyers to act as her eyes.\n\u201cIt was a steep learning curve for us, too,\u201d said Ms. Ruhl, recalling how she told the other lawyers \u201cdon\u2019t be shy to give her work.\u201d But the initial wariness vanished as Ms. Monzur proved herself. \u201cRumana brings a maturity other law students don\u2019t have.\u201d\nMs. Monzur\u2019s tenacity is at the root of her success. She lives with her daughter, who \u201c doesn\u2019t even remember I\u2019m blind because she sees her mother doing everything everyone else is doing,\u201d she said.\nIf anything, the trauma she experienced in Bangladesh has only motivated her to defy expectations of what a blind, single woman can do. \u201cIn the hospital, everyone was saying, \u2018Oh, poor her,\u2019 and I felt like it was the end of my life,\u201d she recalled. \u201cOf course, me being me, I hated that attitude.\u201d\nSo instead of grieving, she has focused on living. \u201cI want people to see the real me, with a smiling face, not someone who lost her sight and completely lost herself,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone has challenges. This is mine. Life is a celebration, I still believe that. You just have to make the best use of it.\u201d",

    "text": "Myanmar Draws Scorn for Rohingya Crisis, but Few Urge Sanctions\n2017-09-18T10:52:50.000Z\nHONG KONG \u2014 Despite international condemnation of Myanmar\u2019s campaign of violence against the Rohingya people, there have been few calls for a return to the sort of sanctions that were long a part of the country\u2019s relationship with the West.\nAfter a Rohingya militant group attacked police outposts last month, Myanmar\u2019s military, along with vigilante groups, launched a crackdown in the western state of Rakhine, triggering a refugee crisis that has sent more than 400,000 Rohingya fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh.\nOn Monday, Boris Johnson, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary,  led a private discussion of the Rohingya crisis among foreign ministers attending the United Nations General Assembly. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto head of Myanmar\u2019s government, last week decided not to attend the General Assembly, where she would probably have drawn a flood of criticism.\nMr. Johnson said nothing about whether the government of Myanmar could face sanctions. In a statement from his office, he called on Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi to take steps to halt the crisis.\nMyanmar\u2019s national security adviser participated in the session, which was closed to the press.\n\u201cI was encouraged by our discussion and by the participation of the senior Burmese representatives,\u201d Mr. Johnson said in the statement, \u201cbut we now need to see action to stop the violence and open up immediate humanitarian access.\u201d\nWhile the United Nations Security Council has the power to impose economic sanctions on Myanmar, that prospect is considered unlikely for now. The Myanmar government has said it was working with Russia and China \u2014 veto-wielding members of the Security Council \u2014 to block any efforts to punish it over the crackdown in Rakhine.\nThe Security Council did condemn the violence last week, its first such unified statement on Myanmar in nine years. But China blocked an effort by Egypt to add language calling for Rohingya refugees to be guaranteed the right to return to Myanmar from Bangladesh, Agence France-Presse reported. The government of Myanmar, a majority-Buddhist country, does not recognize the Rohingya, most of whom are Muslim, as citizens.\nWith regional powers vying to gain influence in Myanmar, China\u2019s government sees potential benefit in backing Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy, while she faces international criticism, said Yun Sun, a scholar at the Stimson Center in Washington.\n\u201cThis is basically an opportunity for China and a vulnerability of Aung San Suu Kyi,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Chinese government says the Rohingya issue doesn\u2019t affect us and by supporting Aung San Suu Kyi we don\u2019t lose anything.\u201d\n\u201cInstead we gain the potential friendship\u201d of the government, Ms. Sun said.\nThe state-run Myanmar News Agency quoted China\u2019s ambassador to Myanmar last week as saying his country supported the crackdown in Rakhine.\n\u201cThe stance of China regarding the terrorist attacks in Rakhine is clear, it is just an internal affair,\u201d said the ambassador, Hong Liang. \u201cThe counterattacks of Myanmar security forces against extremist terrorists and the government\u2019s undertakings to provide assistance to the people are strongly welcomed.\u201d\nIn another sign that China is drawing closer to Myanmar, last week it opened an interim liaison office in Naypyidaw, the remote city that was inaugurated as Myanmar\u2019s capital in 2005. Most foreign missions have stayed in Yangon, the country\u2019s former capital.\nChina\u2019s support for the military crackdown may be partly rooted in the recent opening of a Chinese-operated oil terminal at Kyaukpyu port, in southern Rakhine. While the military\u2019s campaign is being carried out in the north of Rakhine, China would be concerned if the violence expanded and imperiled the terminal, Ms. Sun said.\nOn Monday, Human Rights Watch called for targeted sanctions against Myanmar\u2019s military. It also called for new restrictions on the sale of arms to the country.\n\u201cBurmese security forces are committing ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya and disregarding the condemnation of world leaders,\u201d John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. \u201cThe time has come to impose tougher measures that Burma\u2019s generals cannot ignore.\u201d\nFor decades, Myanmar \u2014 or Burma, as it was formerly known \u2014 was one of the most isolated countries, with the United States and other Western countries enforcing sanctions against its military-led government. But as the military has gradually released some of its political control, the country\u2019s interactions have grown dramatically.\nThe European Union and the United States pulled back broad sanctions after elections in 2012. Then last year, President Barack Obama dropped sanctions on aid from Washington to the government of Myanmar, as well as restrictions on several dozen people with ties to the former military government.\nThat move was made in recognition of the advancement of democracy in Myanmar. But human rights groups worried it would also reduce the leverage the United States had to try to curb abuses against the Rohingya.\nLast week, Senator John McCain of Arizona said he would remove language from a defense-spending bill that would fund cooperation between the militaries of the United States and Myanmar. Mr. McCain has called on Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi to do more to help the Rohingya.\nMs. Aung San Suu Kyi, who was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her long struggle against military rule, has many fans among lawmakers around the world, and that may insulate Myanmar from more serious censure from the United States and other governments.\nThe Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said last week that \u201cpublicly condemning Aung San Suu Kyi, the best hope for democratic reform in Burma, is simply not constructive.\u201d He noted that under Myanmar\u2019s Constitution, she is barred from the presidency and her civilian government has no authority over the military. Her position is \u201can exceedingly difficult one,\u201d he said.\nSean Turnell, an economic adviser to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s office, said her civilian government needs international support, \u201cnot uninformed ostracism or irresponsible or calculated incitement.\u201d\n\u201cThe people who lead this government are the same people who faced down evil for decades,\u201d he added. \u201cThey remain Myanmar\u2019s best hope.\u201d",

    "text": "In a Rohingya Refugee Camp, Soccer Is a Joyful Escape\n2017-07-30T11:08:58.000Z\nCOX\u2019S BAZAR, Bangladesh \u2014 Mohammed Ismail prickled with adrenaline.\nWith one defender between him and the goal, he surged from the left wing, dodging pockmarks in the yellow-dirt soccer field. He stroked the ball with the outer edge of the shoes his father had bought him and, quick as a whip, unleashed a shot that left the goalkeeper gaping.\nMr. Ismail, 24, is a second-generation Rohingya refugee, born in this ramshackle camp in Cox\u2019s Bazar on the southern tip of Bangladesh after his parents fled violence in their native Myanmar. And this was his moment, a joyful escape from painful realities.\n\u201cWhen I play football the sadness and anger is far away,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cBut after I finish, it always comes back.\u201d\nThe soccer field lies on an elevated plain with a sweeping view of the Kutupalong refugee camp: mud-walled hovels and split bamboo structures laced with open sewers. Cockerels and car horns sound from the nearby road.\nThe Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic group, are not recognized as citizens in their native Myanmar even though they have lived there for hundreds of years. They have endured periodic persecution at the hands of the Myanmar armed forces and the majority Buddhist population, who mostly see them as illegal immigrants who should go home to Bangladesh.\nMr. Ismail\u2019s family arrived in 1992 with the first wave of Rohingya refugees, when about 250,000 Rohingya fled abuse at the hands of the Myanmar military. About 33,000 of them remain, living in official United Nations refugee camps in Kutupalong and Nayapara, south of Cox\u2019s Bazar along the Myanmar border.\nBangladesh, a vastly overpopulated country, stopped registering new refugees after 1992, hoping that taking a hard line would deter Rohingya from coming, but it was wrong.\nSince 2012, 200,000 more refugees have come, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, creating an unofficial camp alongside the official one. The latest wave began in October, when the Myanmar military began a deadly counterinsurgency campaign after Rohingya militants attacked three border posts, killing nine police officers.\nRefugees fleeing the military sweep, which was accompanied by arson, murder and rape, more than doubled the size of the unofficial camp, to 75,000 from an estimated 34,000 in 2013, according to the International Organization for Migration.\nThe Bangladeshi government has denied the refugees education and work permits \u201cbecause we want them to return\u201d to Myanmar, said Najnin Sarwar Kaberi, a local official for the governing party, the Bangladesh Awami League. \u201cIf they settle here the size of our population will become unbearable.\u201d\nSoccer is a prized diversion, helping players and spectators forget about their exile, at least for a few hours.\nMohammed Farouque, a refugee who runs a Rohingya soccer club in Malaysia, another destination for the refugees, said that soccer was virtually prohibited to the Rohingya in Myanmar. Most cannot afford the bribe of about $4 required to leave their village, making competitions impossible.\nIn Malaysia and Bangladesh, most Rohingya are stateless, but at least they can hold soccer competitions. \u201cThis is one of the few freedoms we have,\u201d Mr. Farouque said.\nIn Bangladesh, 16 teams \u2014 eight from the unofficial camp and eight from the official camp \u2014 play in an annual World Cup-style competition.\nMr. Ismail said that the unofficial camp teams would be stronger this year now that they had more players to choose from but there was a pervasive feeling that the registered refugees were better equipped.\nThe registered teams have been around long enough to collect periodic handouts of athletic equipment from the United Nations or have been able to earn enough money to buy their own. Unregistered players often wear flip-flops or play in bare feet.\n\u201cIsmail\u2019s team beat us last time because they had boots and we didn\u2019t,\u201d said Ziabur Rohaman, 32, who fled Myanmar with his wife and three children in October and plays for the unregistered camp in Kutupalong. \u201cThey got them from the U.N.H.C.R. but because we arrived recently most of our players didn\u2019t have boots.\u201d\nThe U.N.H.C.R. says that it provides \u201climited support regardless of whether the refugees are registered or not.\u201d Vivian Tan, the agency\u2019s regional press officer, said the agency had provided balls, trophies, track pants and refreshments.\nHowever, the agency is authorized by the Bangladeshi government to provide formal assistance only to registered refugees. That assistance, which includes shelter, cash for food, relief supplies, water, sanitation facilities, basic health care and education up to seventh grade, is prohibited for the unregistered refugees.\nThe winner of the Kutupalong competition plays a team from the Nayapara camp, 50 miles away, to claim the title of best Rohingya team in Bangladesh.\nLast year, Kutupalong beat Nayapara, 3-0, a proud moment for Mr. Ismail.\n\u201cI scored one of the goals, and my teammates voted me man of the match,\u201d he said, sitting in a rough wooden tea shop surrounded by admiring teenagers.\nLike most people at the camp, he has had his share of tragedy and hardship. Last fall, his uncle was killed by the Myanmar Army, he said, forcing his aunt and several cousins to join his family in Bangladesh.\nLast December, he tried to smuggle himself to Malaysia, where, through family connections, he might have been able to attend a university.\nBut the smuggler who promised to help him escape stole his money, about $3,700, and disappeared. The payment \u201cwas all my savings plus money I borrowed and money my mother gave me after selling her jewelry,\u201d Mr. Ismail said.\nAt the tea shop that afternoon, you wouldn\u2019t think he had any cares. He is one of those people whose face defaults to a smile. But his smile is not always joyful: Half the time it\u2019s a working smile, doing the job of holding it all together.\nThe assembled guys all said their favorite player was Lionel Messi, the Argentine forward, considered by some to be the best player in the world. \u201cI love how he cuts through the defense,\u201d said Mr. Ismail, who is also a forward. \u201cHe\u2019s lethal.\u201d\nMr. Ismail will most likely never see a pro game in person, but a big excursion for him is playing with the Cox\u2019s Bazar team in the official Bangladesh league. Rohingya teams are not allowed to play in the official league, but their best players, including Mr. Ismail, are sometimes recruited.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t tell their opponents that I\u2019m Rohingya because they might not agree that I\u2019m eligible to play,\u201d he said.\nWhen he kicked the goal later that day, the ball shot through the rusting posts and bounced off the roofs below. Ismail looped back to his team. They clapped his back and laughed.\nAlready several youngsters were in pursuit of the ball, stumbling in the twilight, eager to be the one to return it. The official refugees beat the team from the unofficial camp, 2-0.\nAfter the match, he asked me to put my Facebook details into his phone so he could stay in touch. The screen still had the last search term he had entered: \u201cFootball hero Messi.\u201d",

    "text": "\u2018We\u2019ll Grow Again\u2019: Bangladesh Cafe Attacked by Terrorists Reopens\n2017-01-11T21:49:15.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 It was nothing special \u2014 just a cafe in a shopping mall supermarket \u2014 but when an elegant matron named Aisha Sattar walked into the newly reopened Holey Artisan Bakery on Wednesday, a sweet, reminiscent look came over her face, as if she weren\u2019t sure it was all real.\nRocky, one of the waiters, caught his breath when he saw her and trailed off in the middle of a sentence: She was Auntie Nini, one of the regulars. The whole day had been like this. A few customers, an owner said, walked in, stepped behind the counter and wordlessly hugged the staff. One woman burst into tears and bought every last pastry and yogurt carton still on sale.\nSix months have passed since anyone thought of the Holey Artisan Bakery with anything but horror.\nIt was once among the most beloved restaurants in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, situated in its diplomatic quarter and popular with expatriates and locals alike. Until, as the dinner crowd was settling in on July 1, five gunmen burst in carrying heavy bags of weaponry, including grenades and rifles.\nDiners and waiters and cooks and busboys scattered throughout the building. The gunmen calmly sorted them, explaining that their intention was to kill only foreigners and non-Muslims. They killed the hostages one by one, using guns and machetes, and used the victims\u2019 phones to publish images of the bodies on social media.\nBy the time the ordeal ended, 10 hours later, 22 people, including two police officers, were dead, the restaurant spattered with blood and shattered glass.\nFor months, Dhaka\u2019s diplomatic quarter was a spooked place. Restaurants were empty night after night. Foreigners no longer left the safety of their compounds. Young Bangladeshis found themselves wondering who they could trust: Several of the terrorists came from wealthy, cosmopolitan families, not so different from the young elites who died in the siege.\nIn an effort to break this trance, the restaurant\u2019s owners decided to reopen the Holey, known for its flour-dusted baguettes and homemade pasta. One of the owners, Ali Arsalan, said he was inspired in part by the staff: When he paid them two months\u2019 salary and suggested they return to their villages to recover from the trauma, they said they would prefer to go back to work.\nSo when a friend offered him a space in his new supermarket, Mr. Arsalan said, he and his business partner said yes \u201cpretty much within five minutes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat else is there to do except move on?\u201d he said on Wednesday. \u201cNo one is going to pay us to sit around and feel bad about what happened.\u201d\nMany were thrilled by the decision. \u201cPast terror, past grief, past agony,\u201d exulted Syeda Zareen Rafa, 17, on Facebook.\nShe has read in the newspapers about young men who have disappeared, perhaps to join militant groups, and she said she worried in the back of her mind that another big attack might happen. But for the moment, she is, as she put it, \u201cecstatic\u201d that the restaurant is back.\n\u201cIt felt like a kind of victory or something,\u201d she said.\nStill, it was painful remembering. Ms. Sattar \u2014 Auntie Nini \u2014 was close friends with Claudia D\u2019Antona, an Italian garment executive killed in the attack. Mr. Arsalan\u2019s 20-year-old nephew, Faraaz Hossain, was one of the victims. Rocky the waiter \u2014 whose full name is Rakib Ahmed \u2014 had, by the luck of the draw, worked the early shift on the day of the siege. For three or four months afterward, he said, he could not sleep.\nThe new space is different from the two-story lakeside home where the restaurant stood until July 1: It is much smaller, inside a mall, and ringed with security. He said he was not under the illusion that the new restaurant would be like the old one.\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain in words how that place felt,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople would bring their children, their dogs, and they would spend all day there. There won\u2019t be a place like that again, because the grounds are now being used for something else, and because there is a fear in people now.\u201d\nHe was heartened, though, by the sight of a dozen foreigners who planted themselves at tables over the course of the day; he had not expected them to dare.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll grow again,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll show people Holey\u2019s back.\u201d",

    "text": "London, North Korea, Rohingya: Your Monday Briefing\n2017-09-17T19:52:46.000Z\nGood morning. \nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\n\u2022 North Korea\u2019s nuclear program and repeated missile tests will be a major focal point as world leaders gather in New York this week for the U.N. General Assembly.\nPresident Trump, who appeared to refer to the North\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, as \u201cRocket Man\u201d in a tweet, delivers his centerpiece speech to the assembly on Tuesday. He has lunch on Thursday with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, who, in an Op-Ed, argues for stronger enforcement of the sanctions against the North.\nOur reporters note U.S. intelligence is trying to determine if ingredients for the unusually powerful fuel the North used in its latest launch may be flowing into the country from China and Russia.\nMany of the leaders will be scrutinizing Mr. Trump, who is attending for the first time, to see how his America First approach fits into the U.N.\u2019s world-first mission. One indication: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has slashed the usual contingent of U.S. diplomats. He\u2019ll meet representatives of Iraq, India, Russia and Myanmar.\n_____\n\u2022 The Rohinyga crisis is also certain to be prominent at the U.N. meetings.\nMore than half of the 400,000 Rohingya Muslims who have fled Myanmar for Bangladesh in recent weeks are children, and many are without their parents. The military violence driving them out came in response to an attack by a new generation of radicalized Rohingya.\nOur Southeast Asia bureau chief visited the overflowing existing camps, seeing endless hands outstretched for food, water or medicine. \u201cYou cannot help everyone,\u201d she wrote, \u201cso you walk on, promising yourself that documenting their suffering is a form of aid.\u201d\nBangladesh plans to construct 14,000 shelters, each able to house six families, near the border in the next 10 days.\n_____\n\u2022 Britain has lowered its terrorism threat level after arresting two men in connection with Friday\u2019s bombing of a London subway station, in which a rudimentary explosive device injured dozens.\nPresident Trump\u2019s tweets about the attack, which asserted that the assailants had been known to Scotland Yard, strained relations with British leaders.\n_____\n\u2022 \u201cThere\u2019s only a little resistance left.\u201d \nPhilippine troops are closing in on Islamic State-inspired militants in the war-torn city of Marawi, according to the country\u2019s defense minister.\nAnd a priest who had been held captive since May was freed amid the heavy fighting.\n_____\n\u2022 For the first time, Stephen Colbert is hosting the Emmy Awards.\nThe race for best drama is wide open, with \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d seen as top contenders. \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d is also poised to have a big night.\nHere\u2019s our live briefing, with highlights and updates. You can also join our TV critics for a lively conversation.\n\u2022 Australia\u2019s Ten Network, awaiting a court ruling today on whether CBS will be allowed to take it over, is suddenly the focus of a bidding war involving the Murdochs\u2019 News Corporation and Bruce Gordon\u2019s WIN Corporation.\n\u2022 The tangled state of the ride-hailing industry is making for strange bedfellows. Uber is nearing a funding deal with SoftBank, and Lyft held discussions with Alphabet.\n\u2022 Rolling Stone, once a bible for the counterculture, is going up for sale on the eve of its 50th anniversary.\n\u2022 Dogecoin was meant to poke fun at the hype around virtual currency. But now, its creator says, Dogecoin illustrates the risks.\n\u2022 Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets.\n\u2022 Kuala Lumpur\u2019s police chief said that seven boys, aged 11 to 18, were arrested in the fire at a religious boarding school that killed 23 people, and that an exchange of taunts with the school\u2019s students may have precipitated arson. [Al Jazeera]\n\u2022 Typhoon Talim is moving north across Japan after striking with record rains that halted bullet train service and many flights. [The Asahi Shimbun]\n\u2022 Hamas agreed to dissolve its governing body in Gaza and allow the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority to take over and hold general elections \u2014 possibly signaling the end of a decade of bitter feuding with its rival, Fatah. [The Jerusalem Post]\n\u2022 Cambodia\u2019s prime minister, Hun Sen, hit back at new U.S. visa sanctions by saying his country would no longer help find and repatriate the remains of American soldiers killed during the Vietnam War. [The Phnom Penh Post]\n\u2022 Four American tourists were attacked with acid by a woman with \u201ca psychiatric history\u201d at a train station in southern France. [The New York Times]\n\u2022 Two rare white giraffes were spotted in Kenya. [The New York Times]\n\u2022 In Indonesia,  rangers at a national park in West Java photographed a rare big cat, leading to speculation that it was a Javan tiger, a species declared extinct 40 years ago. [The New York Times]\nTips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life.\n\u2022 Recipe of the day: Use a muffin tray to make Melissa Clark\u2019s zucchini and tomato tartlets with a Cheddar crust.\n\u2022 Here\u2019s how to clean up safely after a cyclone, hurricane, flood or other natural disaster.\n\u2022 Five steps can help you choose a reliable nursing home.\n\u2022 The Chinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang filled a grand American boulevard with a fleet of choreographed pedicabs festooned with 1,000 handmade paper lanterns that appeared as flying fireflies. \u201cIt was just so charming and it made you laugh,\u201d a viewer said.\n\u2022 Western food companies are aggressively expanding in developing nations, unleashing a marketing juggernaut that\u2019s contributing to a new epidemic of chronic illnesses fed by soaring rates of obesity.\n\u2022 And 41 years ago, Antonio Inoki, one of Japan\u2019s most popular pro wrestlers, faced Muhammad Ali in a bout that some called a publicity stunt. Similar criticism emerged as Mr. Inoki, now a 74-year-old lawmaker, returned last week from North Korea, where he said he discussed nuclear diplomacy.\nOn this day in 1973, Jimmy Carter, then governor of Georgia, filled out a report saying that he had seen a U.F.O.\nIt wasn\u2019t such a strange statement at the time \u2014 a Gallup poll that year found that 51 percent of people interviewed believed in unidentified flying objects, and that 11 percent believed they had seen \u201ca flying saucer\u201d themselves.\nMr. Carter filed his report with the unofficial National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, and said he had seen the object in Leary, Ga., in 1969.\nDecades later, he recounted the incident on CNN: \u201cI and about 25 others saw something in the air that changed colors and was round and came and left. We couldn\u2019t figure out what it was.\u201d\nBut he added that he believed it was impossible \u201cto have space people from other planets or other stars\u201d come to Earth.\nWhile he didn\u2019t believe they could visit us, Mr. Carter did record a message for \u201cpossible unknown civilizations in the galaxies\u201d as president. It was part of the golden record placed in the Voyager in August 1977.\nHe said it represented \u201cour hope and our determination, our good will in the vast and awesome universe.\u201d\nKaren Zraick contributed reporting.\n_____\nYour Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

    "text": "Texas, Wells Fargo, Russia: Your Thursday Evening Briefing\n2017-08-31T22:13:48.000Z\n(Want to get this briefing by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.)\nGood evening. Here\u2019s the latest.\n1. New dangers are emerging in the aftermath of Harvey, as floodwaters recede and the dwindling storm moves through Louisiana and into Mississippi. Forecasters say it should end on Saturday.\nExplosions were reported overnight at a damaged chemical plant near Houston, a hub for chemical and petrochemical plants. More blasts are feared. And much of the city is still covered in a toxic stew of chemicals, sewage, debris and waste.\nMore than 30,000 people remain in shelters like the Houston convention center, above. More details of what people suffered are becoming clear, like the wrenching tale of the 3-year-old found clinging to her mother\u2019s body.\nHere\u2019s a quick guide to our full coverage \u2014 access is free. Check here for how to help victims.\n_____\n2. Today on our podcast \u201cThe Daily,\u201d we discuss how Harvey is forcing Houston, the limitless city, to consider its limits.\nThe capital of the world\u2019s petroleum industry was built on boundless entrepreneurialism, the glories of air-conditioning and a fierce aversion to regulation.\nMany experts now say that unbridled development \u2014 and city planning that failed to account for environmental issues \u2014 helped lay the groundwork for disaster.\n_____\n3. For years, Wells Fargo employees struggling to meet aggressive sales goals secretly signed up customers for credit cards without telling them.\nThe bank was caught. But the tale seemed to be over only in September, when it agreed to pay $185 million in settlements. Now an internal review has found there were 3.5 million such accounts \u2014 about 1.4 million more than previously estimated.\nThe review also found a new problem: the unauthorized enrollments of possibly half a million customers in the bank\u2019s online bill payment service.\n_____\n4. The Trump administration ordered Russia to close its San Francisco consulate, above, and two other sites in New York and Washington in a diplomatic tit for tat.\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson informed Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, of the move by phone. American officials said it was a fair move after Russia ordered the U.S. to cut hundreds of embassy employees in Moscow.\n_____\n5. Pakistan\u2019s most controversial murder trial ended in a verdict that stunned many.\nA terrorism court acquitted five suspected Taliban and Qaeda militants in the 2007 assassination of the former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, above, and declared the former ruler, Pervez Musharraf, who is living in Abu Dhabi, a fugitive in the case.\nHe rejects any involvement in her death, and her party intends to appeal. The long-running case has been dogged by intimidation and threats to the judiciary from militants.\n_____\n6. A building collapsed in rain-ravaged Mumbai, killing at least 14 people, according to a local official. It was the latest in a series of disasters involving substandard buildings in the city.\nOur South Asia bureau chief writes that epic floods are \u201cpart of the landscape\u201d in Mumbai, a megacity of 18 million built on a peninsula. This year\u2019s monsoons have been especially heavy \u2014 not only for Mumbai, but across India, Bangladesh and Nepal. Tens of millions of people have been affected by months of flooding and mudslides, and more than 1,000 people have died.\n_____\n7. The U.S. and South Korea wrapped up their annual joint military exercises, flying some of their most powerful warplanes in live bombing drills. (Above, a meeting between military leaders from the two countries in Washington.) The drills were a big show of force just two days after North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan.\nTomorrow is the deadline for all U.S. citizens to leave North Korea to comply with new rules issued by the White House. Aid workers say the ban imperils their work fighting disease and teaching in the sealed, impoverished country, but its brutal government has repeatedly detained Americans for mild offenses. One U.S. student was returned this year in a coma, and died.\n_____\n8. \u201cThe mood was febrile, angry, reckless. Flowers were piled knee-deep at the gates of the royal palaces; grown men wept openly in the streets.\u201d\nThat\u2019s our writer recalling the scene in London after the death of Diana, 20 years ago today. One unlikely part of the princess\u2019s legacy, she writes, is how she reshaped the monarchy that rejected her, and the country as well.\nOther correspondents offered their recollections, including of the widespread rancor the royal family\u2019s initial aloofness provoked. And one who was at the Paris hospital when Prince Charles arrived to take Diana\u2019s body home answered readers\u2019 questions in a Facebook Live segment.\n_____\n9. Think Christmas creep, but orange. Pumpkin spice products are already showing up on shelves, before many consumers have even changed out of their summer shorts.\nThis year\u2019s offerings include Pumpkin Spice Cheerios and pumpkin-flavored coffee from Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, which says it is \u201cdoubling down on fall flavors.\u201d\nFor the record, fall officially begins on Sept. 22.\n_____\n10. Finally, Warner Bros. reportedly reached a deal to remake the 1954 novel \u201cLord of the Flies,\u201d as a movie, but featuring girls, not boys, set free on an island with no adults. Above, the 1963 version of the film.\nThe news set off criticism from online commenters who said an all-girl island would never devolve into the kind of chaos seen in the story, which of course, is frequently assigned in schools and examines the inherent evil of humanity. (It didn\u2019t help that the film will be written and directed by two men.)\nOthers questioned the notion that girls don\u2019t fight, in real life or on the big screen. Many invoked \u201cMean Girls.\u201d\nHave a great night.\n_____\nIf photographs appear out of order, please download the updated New York Times app from iTunes or Google Play.\nYour Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.\nAnd don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a.m. Sundays.\nWant to catch up on past briefings?

But record earnings in its chip business helped drive fourth-quarter operating profits sharply up.\nSeparately, the cancellation of three concerts in China to be given by Sumi Jo, the famed South Korean soprano, above, heightened suspicions of Chinese payback over Seoul\u2019s decision to deploy a U.S. missile-defense system to counter North Korea\u2019s growing military capabilities.\n_____\n\u2022 The Times has started a weekly email that explains the ideas and context behind major world events.

    "text": "Roy Moore, New York City, Jerusalem: Your Wednesday Briefing\n2017-12-12T19:07:41.000Z\nGood morning. \nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\n\u2022 In the southern U.S. state of Alabama, Democrats celebrated an unlikely victory in an election to fill a crucial Senate seat. (Here are detailed results.)\nThe race captivated the nation not only for its debates over party loyalty and morality, but also for its immense implications for both parties: The upset trims the Republican majority in the Senate to one. It is a snub of President Trump, who backed Roy Moore, the Republican candidate, above, despite accusations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls.\nEarlier in the day Mr. Trump lashed out at his own accusers as fabricators and insulted a female senator as someone who \u201cwould do anything\u201d for campaign contributions.\nMeanwhile, congressional Republicans are near an agreement on a tax bill and began work on dismantling Obama-era rules on higher education.\n_____\n\u2022 New Yorkers mostly kept their fears at bay and the subway turnstiles spinning a day after a botched attack in an underground passageway.\nThe U.S. government filed terrorism charges against the suspect, Akayed Ullah, 27. Investigators said the Bangladeshi immigrant told them he had been radicalized online and had made a number of trips overseas in the past five years, visiting Bangladesh in recent months.\n\u201cHe was a good guy,\u201d said a cabdriver who prayed with Mr. Ullah at a Brooklyn mosque. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he would do anything like this.\u201d\n_____\n\u2022 \u201cI will spare the party any further distraction.\u201d\nWith those words, the Australian opposition lawmaker Sam Dastyari agreed to resign after fending off accusations for months that he pushed China\u2019s foreign policy interests after taking money from Chinese-born political donors.\nMore than 60 asylum seekers in Australia\u2019s offshore detention program on Manus Island have been called in by American officials to discuss potential resettlement in the U.S.\n_____\n\u2022 Sri Lanka\u2019s recent agreement to hand over its strategic port of Hambantota to China has raised fears for its sovereignty \u2014 and concerns that the huge foreign infrastructure investments China is making for its \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative could end up in international land grabs.\nBeneficiaries can find themselves owing China more than they can pay. Sri Lanka owes $8 billion for projects that have sometimes turned out to be white elephants (like the world\u2019s emptiest airport, examined in the Times Magazine in September).\n_____\n\u2022 President Emmanuel Macron of France tried to shore up support for the Paris climate deal by urging heads of state to commit more funding to the fight against global warming.\nSome doubt whether the global community can achieve the emission goals that were set two years ago, given President Trump\u2019s decision to pull the U.S. out of the deal.\nOur international climate correspondent looks at a surprising factor in greenhouse gas emissions: A third of all the food grown on Earth is simply wasted.\n_____\n\u2022 Reviews of \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d are finally out. \nHere\u2019s a bit from ours: \u201cLo, it is a satisfying, at times transporting entertainment. Remarkably, it has visual wit and a human touch, no small achievement for a seemingly indestructible machine that revved up 40 years ago and shows no signs of sputtering out (ever).\u201d\n_____\n\u2022 Westfield, the Australian firm that operates dozens of malls in the U.S. (including at One World Trade Center in New York, above) is being bought for $15.7 billion by Unibail-Rodamco, a Paris-based property investment firm. The combined company would hold property worth $72 billion.\n\u2022 China shut down big chemical factories in its west for as long as four months to free up natural gas to heat homes, schools and hospitals \u2014 another example of how painful and expensive it will be to wean the country off coal.\n\u2022 Artificial intelligence may make half of today\u2019s jobs obsolete in 20 years. What will be left? (\u201cThe robot plumber is a long, long way away.\u201d)\n\u2022 U.S. stocks were mixed. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets.\n\u2022 Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group, said it would \u201cdedicate all its time to resistance\u201d on behalf of Palestinians. The remarks came at a large protest in Beirut against President Trump\u2019s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. [The New York Times]\n\u2022 India declared condom commercials \u201cindecent\u201d television viewing for children and restricted them to 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. [The New York Times]\n\u2022 In Afghanistan, critics of President Ashraf Ghani are losing patience over delayed elections. [The New York Times]\n\u2022 Robert Mugabe, 93, left Zimbabwe for medical tests in Singapore, his first foreign travel since the army forced him from office last month. [Reuters]\n\u2022 \u201cWhy do they bully?\u201d A video of a boy in Tennessee prompted a flood of online support, but it soon led to questions and controversy. [The New York Times]\n\u2022 Raelene Castle is the new chief executive of Rugby Australia. The New Zealander is the first woman to hold such a post in world rugby. [The Daily Telegraph]\n\u2022 A human foot washed ashore in western Canada, the 13th such case since 2007. So far, none have been traced to foul play.

    "text": "U.S. Imposes Sanctions on 52 People and Entities for Abuse and Corruption\n2017-12-21T19:29:22.000Z\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States imposed sanctions on 52 people and entities Thursday for alleged human rights violations and corruption, a list that included Maung Maung Soe, a top Burmese general cited for an ongoing deadly crackdown on the Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic group.\nMaj. Gen. Maung Maung Soe was the chief of the Burmese Army\u2019s Western Command during a crackdown that survivors say involved government soldiers stabbing babies, cutting off the heads of boys, gang-raping girls and burning entire families to death. More than 620,000 refugees have flooded into neighboring Bangladesh since August, fleeing what Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson described as \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d\nMaj. Gen. Maung Maung Soe is the first high-level Burmese military official to named in sanctions, an action that the Treasury Department said grew out of credible evidence of his involvement in the crackdown.\n\u201cToday, the United States is taking a strong stand against human rights abuse and corruption globally by shutting these bad actors out of the U.S. financial system,\u201d said Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, adding that the sanctions send \u201ca message that there is a steep price to pay for their misdeeds.\u201d\nAmong others penalized on Thursday was Yahya Jammeh, former president of Gambia who came to power in 1994 and stepped down in 2017. Mr. Jammeh created a terror and assassination squad called the Junglers that he used to intimidate, interrogate and kill people who threatened him, according to the Treasury designation. Benjamin Bol Mel of South Sudan, Dan Gertler, who did business in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Mukhtar Hamid Shah of Pakistan were also on the list.\nThe designations are the first to result from the passage last year of the Global Magnitsky Act, a bipartisan bill intended to punish people around the world who are credibly accused of serious violations of human rights and of corruption. The law was a follow-on to a similarly named law passed in 2012 designed to punish such people only in Russia. On Wednesday, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on five Russians in designations from that earlier law. Among those targeted on Wednesday was the leader of the Republic of Chechnya.\nThe sanctions freeze any assets the individuals or entities hold in the United States and also prevent them from using any American financial institution for banking or other purposes. Since the United States financial system has such broad global reach, the sanctions make it difficult for the individuals to use major banks anywhere in the world.\nThe laws were named after Sergei L. Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who died in pretrial detention after exposing a $230 million tax-theft scam plotted by Russian officials.\nHuman rights advocates cheered Thursday\u2019s designations.\n\u201cThe fact that these listings were made today reflects the reality that despite many disagreements in Washington about the U.S. government\u2019s role in promoting human rights, there is a bipartisan consensus the U.S. government can and should act to hold human rights abusers to account,\u201d said John Sifton, the Asia advocacy director for Human Rights Watch.\nThe sanctions against Maj. Gen. Maung Maung Soe are among the first concrete actions by the United States against a top Burmese official for the continuing murderous campaign against the Rohingya. Administration officials have been nervous about punishing Myanmar\u2019s government because they worry that broader sanctions could jeopardize the country\u2019s fragile transition to democracy after decades of repressive military rule.\nThe crackdown on the Rohingya is thought to be broadly popular in Myanmar, which is majority Buddhist.\nThe Trump administration has cut back on refugee resettlements, arguing that preserving refugees in their home countries is better and more efficient. Whether the Rohingya will ever be able to return to Myanmar is far from certain.\nTrump administration officials would not say whether more Burmese leaders would be added to the sanctions list. Mr. Sifton said the State Department may be keeping some names in reserve in hopes of persuading Burmese officials to stop the brutal campaign.\nSenator John McCain, Republican from Arizona, and Senator Ben Cardin, Democrat from Maryland, who co-authored the Global Magnitsky Act, released a joint statement welcoming Thursday\u2019s designations.\n\u201cWe look forward to continuing to work with the administration and the human rights community to end a global culture of impunity and ensure robust and comprehensive implementation of this landmark law,\u201d the statement said.",

    "text": "Hurricanes, Climate and the Capitalist Offset\n2017-08-31T07:21:23.000Z\nTexans will find few consolations in the wake of a hurricane as terrifying as Harvey. But here, at least, is one: A biblical storm has hit them, and the death toll \u201438 as of this writing \u2014 is mercifully low, given its intensity.\nThis is not how it plays out in much of the world. In 1998, Hurricane Mitch ripped through Central America and killed anywhere between 11,000 and 19,000 people, mostly in Honduras and Nicaragua. Nearly a decade later Cyclone Nargis slammed into Myanmar and a staggering 138,000 people perished.\nNature\u2019s furies \u2014 hurricanes, earthquakes, landslides, droughts, infectious diseases, you name it \u2014 may strike unpredictably. But their effects are not distributed at random.\nRich countries tend to experience, and measure, the costs of such disasters primarily in terms of money. Poor countries experience them primarily in terms of lives. Between 1940 and 2016, a total of 3,348 people died in the United States on account of hurricanes, according to government data, for an average of 43 victims a year. That\u2019s a tragedy, but compare it to the nearly 140,000 lives lost when a cyclone hit Bangladesh in 1991.\nWhy do richer countries fare so much better than poorer ones when it comes to natural disasters? It isn\u2019t just better regulation. I grew up in Mexico City, which adopted stringent building codes following a devastating earthquake in 1957. That didn\u2019t save the city in the 1985 earthquake, when we learned that those codes had been flouted for years by lax or corrupt building inspectors, and thousands of people were buried under the rubble of shoddy construction. Regulation is only as good, or bad, as its enforcement.\nA better answer lies in the combination of government responsiveness and civic spiritedness so splendidly on display this week in Texas. And then there\u2019s the matter of wealth.\nEvery child knows that houses of brick are safer than houses of wood or straw \u2014 and therefore cost more to build. Harvey will damage or ruin thousands of homes. But it won\u2019t sweep away entire neighborhoods, as Typhoon Haiyan did in the Philippine city of Tacloban in 2013.\nHarvey will also inflict billions in economic damage, most crushingly on uninsured homeowners. The numbers are likely to be staggering in absolute terms, but what\u2019s more remarkable is how easily the American economy can absorb the blow. The storm will be a \u201cspeed bump\u201d to Houston\u2019s $503 billion economy, according to Moody\u2019s Analytics\u2019 Adam Kamins, who told The Wall Street Journal that he expects the storm to derail growth for about two months.\nOn a global level, the University of Colorado\u2019s Roger Pielke Jr. notes that disaster losses as a percentage of the world\u2019s G.D.P., at just 0.3 percent, have remained constant since 1990. That\u2019s despite the dollar cost of disasters having nearly doubled over the same time \u2014 at just about the same rate as the growth in the global economy. (Pielke is yet another victim of the climate lobby\u2019s hyperactive smear machine, but that doesn\u2019t make his data any less valid.)\nClimate activists often claim that unchecked economic growth and the things that go with are principal causes of environmental destruction. In reality, growth is the great offset. It\u2019s a big part of the reason why, despite our warming planet, mortality rates from storms have declined from .11 per 100,000 in the 1900s to .04 per 100,000 in the 2010s, according to data compiled by Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser. Death rates from other natural disasters such as floods and droughts have fallen by even more staggering percentages over the last century.\nThat\u2019s because economic growth isn\u2019t just a matter of parking lots paving over paradise. It also underwrites safety standards, funds scientific research, builds spillways and wastewater plants, creates \u201cgreen jobs,\u201d subsidizes Elon Musk, sets aside prime real estate for conservation, and so on. Poverty, not wealth, is the enemy of the environment. Only the rich have the luxury of developing an ethical stance toward their trash.\nThe paradox of our time is that the part of the world that has never been safer from the vagaries of nature seems never to have been more terrified of them. Harvey truly is an astonishing storm, the likes of which few people can easily remember.\nThen again, as meteorologist Philip Klotzbach points out, it\u2019s also only one of four Category 4 or 5 hurricanes to make landfall in the United States since 1970. By contrast, more than twice as many such storms made landfall between 1922 and 1969. Make of that what you will, but remember that fear is often a function of unfamiliarity.\nHouston will ultimately recover from Harvey\u2019s devastation because its people are creative and courageous. They will rebuild and, when the next storm comes, as it inevitably will, be better prepared for it. The best lesson the world can take from Texas is to follow the path of its extraordinary economic growth on the way to environmental resilience.",

    "text": "What Sandy Can Teach Harvey About Recovery\n2017-09-01T00:44:02.000Z\nDisasters are meant to inform each other, the mistakes of one recovery observed and presumably avoided in the next. Those tasked with remaking Houston in the wake of the current devastation, will have a thick playbook of error on which to reflect.\nIn the days following Hurricane Sandy, New York\u2019s Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg sought above all not to duplicate the failures of Hurricane Katrina, seven years earlier \u2014 failures that had delivered so much corruption and waste. To that end, his administration brought in expensive consultants (because, really what better safeguard against excess?) and developed an application process for homeowners needing rebuilding help so onerous and overdetermined it was hardly viable. Famously, more than a year after the hurricane had rendered its miseries, not one of the 20,000 applicants who had sought help had seen any work begin. Hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid sat idle.\nLast fall, to mark the storm\u2019s fourth anniversary, Mayor Bill de Blasio's Office of Housing Recovery Operations issued a report stating that although the city had set the goal of completing work on single-family homes by the end of 2016 through its Build It Back program, challenges had emerged, among them a lack of available architects and contractors to handle the construction. So much development had already overtaken the city, much of it on the waterfront, however illogically in the age of climate uncertainty, that the talent was deployed elsewhere. We were building new vulnerable homes potentially to suffer the same fate as the ruins we were ignoring.\nWith Texas in mind, it is dispiriting to walk through parts of the Rockaways or low-lying coastal Brooklyn five years after the fact and see houses still boarded up, still getting repaired or only now getting elevated as a means of protection against future storms. On Brighton 4th Street in Brighton Beach for instance, a small white bungalow is just receiving the rehabilitation it needed, a basement apartment bare to its newly installed layers of insulation, as if the hurricane had happened on Memorial Day.\nSome of the permanent occupants, 16 members of an extended Bangladeshi family whose patriarch, Mohammad Rahman, immigrated to the United States more than 30 years ago and works as a taxi driver, are living upstairs while the renovation is completed below. Others are living elsewhere as it goes on. After the hurricane, the family moved out for three months; the house had suffered extensive damage from eight feet of flooding. The roof, gutters, floors, ceilings, dry wall, boiler, foundation all needed repair. Mr. Rahman began the work himself with money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency but had to stop when that money ran out.\nThat the repairs are now getting finished at all is thanks only to the efforts of a nonprofit organization, SBP, founded 11 years ago by a young couple, Zack Rosenburg and Liz McCartney, who volunteered in Louisiana\u2019s St. Bernard Parish after Katrina. Since then the organization has rebuilt homes for more than 1,200 families around the country who have suffered through natural disasters, relying heavily on AmeriCorps volunteers who would disappear if the budget proposed by President Trump were to be enacted. AmeriCorps operates under the Corporation for National and Community Service which would be eliminated.\nIn the New York field office that SBP still maintains in the Rockaways on Beach 88th Street is something called the \u201cWall of Waiting,\u201d pictures of some of the 31 families whose homes are still in need of extensive work. There are currently 18 projects running across Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island, and the office continues to receive three to four calls a week for help, its executive director Thomas Corley told me. One of the AmeriCorps volunteers in the office, Tomika Copeland, said that in her own apartment complex in the Rockaways the boiler had been problematic since Hurricane Sandy, and power continued to go out occasionally. The complex had only recently received funds for repairs.\nIn its various projects, SBP has been especially effective in reducing the time it takes to build and rebuild houses. Mentored by Toyota, whose lean manufacturing systems have been studied and celebrated for decades, the organization managed to cut the number of construction days on a single house from about 120 to 63. In its office in the Rockaways it keeps an enormous progress and goals-setting chart that is similar to the kind Toyota maintains in its production plants around the world. \u201cWe don\u2019t do this all for some affirmation that we are good people,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Corley said, \u2018\u2018this is a business, a business in which waste and mismanagement roll up to more human suffering.\u201d\nIn New York, after Hurricane Sandy, one major problem was that the city continued with its recovery plan even as it clearly wasn\u2019t succeeding. \u201cThere needs to be a culture of leadership to talk about what\u2019s not working,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Rosenburg, who serves as the chief executive of SBP, advised. \u201cAt the outset of a disaster leaders have to set hard and fast recovery goals, which is easier now than ever because of satellites and big data,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cBut often a plan is written with a mind-set focused on compliance rather than outcome. If a contract says that 1,000 houses need to be done by February then there should be incentives to get that done and consequences if it doesn\u2019t.\u201d",

But it doesn\u2019t change 401(k) plans, as had been widely feared. (Here are some other nuggets in the bill.)\nThe architects of the bill said it would deliver a tax break of $1,182 a year to a family of four earning $59,000 a year. How would it affect your taxes? It\u2019s too soon to predict, writes our personal finance columnist, Ron Lieber, but the benefits to the middle class may be fleeting.\n\u2022 We talked to economists about the pros and cons of the measure, which supporters say would lift the economy.\n\u2022 Pieces of paper and two cellphones found at the scene of Tuesday\u2019s truck attack in Lower Manhattan appear to show how the suspect, Sayfullo Saipov, became radicalized.\nOn Thursday, the Islamic State made an uncharacteristically late claim of responsibility for the rampage, which killed eight people and wounded 12. New York began placing hundreds of concrete barriers along the bike path where the attack occurred.\nSeparately, Islamic State fighters were ousted from their last foothold in a major Syrian city, state-run television reported today.\n\u2022 \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d: We look at the everyday Arabic phrase \u2014 meaning \u201cGod is great\u201d \u2014 that has been seized on by jihadists.\n\u2022 President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have both said that they didn\u2019t know of anybody in the Trump campaign who had been in contact with Russians. Court documents unsealed this week suggest otherwise.\nThe documents also mentioned Sam Clovis, a former Trump campaign aide who was in the running for a senior position at the Department of Agriculture.

The Nobel Peace Prize laureate controls the country\u2019s civilian government but has no authority over its military.\n\u2022 There is little overlap between the international and domestic narratives: Myanmar\u2019s government says the Rohingya are killing their own people.\n\u2022 A Marine attacked an Iraqi restaurant in Oregon.

Germany, seeking cost savings during World War I, heard the idea and enacted it in 1915. Three weeks later, the British followed, and other world powers were close behind, including the U.S. in 1918.\nDespite the common belief that American farmers supported the change, they were actually the strongest lobby against it because it disrupted their schedules, said David Prerau, the author of \u201cSeize the Daylight.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how that ever became a myth, but it is the exact opposite,\u201d he said.\nYou can find out more about daylight saving time here.\nDaniel Victor contributed reporting.\n_____\nYour Morning Briefing is published weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern and updated all morning.

    "text": "What We\u2019re Watching at This Year\u2019s United Nations General Assembly\n2017-09-17T22:49:43.000Z\nUNITED NATIONS \u2014 When the 193-member United Nations convenes this week for the annual General Assembly speeches and high-level meetings, world leaders will be paying closest attention to the words and gestures of the most unconventional \u2014 and powerful \u2014 leader among them.\nWhat President Trump says, whom he may offend, please or surprise and how other international leaders react at the world\u2019s largest diplomatic gathering are topics that are likely to dominate the chatter at the United Nations, which, in its 72nd year, is barely older than Mr. Trump.\nHere are five issues to watch:\nWhile this will be Mr. Trump\u2019s first visit to the United Nations as president, he has castigated the organization as an elitist \u201cclub\u201d and proposed what amount to drastic cuts in voluntary contributions from the United States, the single-biggest donor.\nMr. Trump has taken issue with what much of the world regards as one of the most significant achievements at the United Nations, the Paris climate accord to curb greenhouse gases and arrest global warming. His administration also has objected to other positions advocated by the United Nations: protecting the rights of refugees and migrants; the Iran nuclear agreement; and a new treaty that many members are expected to sign on Wednesday that would outlaw all nuclear weapons.\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump will host a meeting to discuss what his ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, has described as badly needed reforms at the United Nations to make it more efficient and responsive. What will he demand from an organization he has pilloried? How will he treat the new leader of the United Nations, Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who told reporters last week that he had been trying to build a \u201cconstructive relationship\u201d with Mr. Trump? What, if anything, will Mr. Trump say about global warming in his speech to the General Assembly on Tuesday morning?\nBy now, North Korea\u2019s defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions banning its tests of ballistic missiles and atomic bombs has become almost routine. Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, launched a missile on Friday that flew longer than any others previously tested \u2014 just four days after the most recent raft of sanctions was adopted and just as General Assembly preparations were getting underway.\nWhat will he do when world leaders converge in New York? (Mr. Kim is not coming.) Mr. Trump, who has vowed a \u201cfire and fury\u201d response if North Korea threatens the United States, is expected to make North Korea a major theme in his General Assembly speech. Whether he will engage in what critics have described as rash talk remains unclear.\nMr. Guterres and his top human rights official have both described the killings and persecution of Myanmar\u2019s Rohingya Muslim minority as a textbook example of ethnic cleansing. With nearly a half-million Rohingya refugees now in Bangladesh and daily evidence of atrocities in Myanmar, what will world leaders say? Will the Security Council, which is empowered to do something to halt the killings, maintain its conspicuously mild response despite increased pressure to act quickly?\nChina, Myanmar\u2019s main patron, is reluctant to issue any statement calling for an end to military operations. On Monday, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, is scheduled to lead a meeting of foreign ministers on Myanmar.\nMr. Trump and his ambassador, Ms. Haley, have both sought to vilify Iran as a sponsor of terrorism and have suggested that the United States may abandon the 2015 deal negotiated by the Obama administration and five other major powers that limited Iran\u2019s nuclear activities. So far Mr. Trump \u2014 who is expected to make Iran another theme of his General Assembly speech \u2014 has grudgingly accepted the nuclear agreement despite having described it as one of the worst ever negotiated.\nWill he go forward with threats to repudiate it and risk isolation? Western diplomats have expressed worry about the administration\u2019s hostility to the accord, saying that it could create more nuclear uncertainty at a time when the world is trying to deal with North Korea.\nA meeting of the parties that negotiated the deal with Iran \u2014 Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States \u2014 will take place on the sidelines of the General Assembly on Wednesday. But there is no expectation that Mr. Trump\u2019s secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, will meet his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif. Nor is there is any expectation of direct communication between Mr. Trump and President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, who is expected to give a news conference on Wednesday.\nThe General Assembly is taking place against a backdrop of apocalyptic droughts, floods and hurricanes, including two that have ravaged parts of Texas, Florida and the Caribbean in the past few weeks. What will world leaders say about these disasters and the Paris climate deal? Will the Trump administration be swayed to rethink its decision to withdraw?\nMr. Trump reiterated his climate-change skepticism after a visit to Florida on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ve had bigger storms than this,\u201d he told reporters.",

    "text": "Houston, Tax Overhaul, Syria: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing\n2017-08-30T22:11:19.000Z\n(Want to get this briefing by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.)\nGood evening. Here\u2019s the latest.\n1. Tropical Storm Harvey shifted its wrath to areas east of Houston, hitting the Beaumont-Port Arthur area of Texas with record-breaking rainfall and devastating floods.\nAt least 38 deaths have been reported throughout the region. Among the victims was a woman who was swept into a canal and drowned, while her child survived by clinging to her. This video shows the emotional and physical toll on storm survivors.\nOur journalists are fanning out to cover the storm and its aftermath. Here\u2019s a collection of the most powerful photographs, (like the one above, of an intersection in northeastern Houston), and a guide to our coverage. Access is free.\n_____\n2. President Trump pitched a tax overhaul during a visit to Missouri, saying cuts for corporations and eliminating loopholes would help the middle class get raises \u2014 but he offered few details beyond the goal of reducing the corporate tax rate to 15 percent.\nA leading economist disputed the notion that changing the tax system would lead to a growth spurt. In related news, the U.S. economy grew 3 percent in the second quarter, its fastest pace in two years, according to new government figures revising the initial report of just 2.6 percent.\n_____\n3. The U.S.-led military coalition in Syria bombed a road and bridge to block the transfer of hundreds of Islamic State fighters, foiling a deal made by the Lebanese Army, Hezbollah and Syrian loyalist forces. Above, a man aboard one of the buses transferring the militants.\nAnd the U.S. demonstrated the capabilities of its missile defense system, successfully intercepting a medium-range ballistic missile in a test off the coast of Hawaii. A short time later, President Trump accused past administrations of paying \u201cextortion money\u201d to North Korea on Twitter. It was not clear what he was referring to.\n_____\n4. Since February, our Mexico City bureau has published exclusives about the government\u2019s use of advanced spying technology to monitor lawyers, journalists and others who have investigated corruption. Above, a protest against the spying in June.\nThe latest target is the son of a prominent businessman, who has used his wealth to invest in civil society groups that fight corruption.\n\u201cWe are under siege, but we will continue to denounce corruption and impunity whenever we find it, be it public or private,\u201d the son, Claudio Gonz\u00e1lez Jr., said in a statement to The Times. \u201cMexico is not condemned to be corrupt.\u201d\n_____\n5. Tomorrow is the 20th anniversary of the death of Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in Paris. We\u2019ll have coverage of the commemorations in Britain, where she remains a powerful symbol. Above, her sons, William and Harry, walked past a memorial.\nA Times of London columnist, in a guest appearance in our pages, writes that despite Diana\u2019s troubled life and tragic death, \u201cthe people\u2019s princess\u201d repaired Britain\u2019s broken monarchy. But our reporter found that for younger adults, the anniversary carries less resonance.\n_____\n6. At least 18,500 members of the Rohingya, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group, fled to Bangladesh from western Myanmar to escape renewed fighting. Most of them were women, children and the elderly.\nAn attack on government posts by a Rohingya militant group last week has led to clashes and a crackdown. The United Nations and human rights groups are calling on the government to exercise restraint, while nationalist monks are urging security forces to assert control over Rakhine State.\n_____\n7. A gerrymandering case will be argued before the Supreme Court in October. Ahead of that, our magazine writer used Wisconsin as a case study to explain why it matters and how it could shape our democracy.\nShe found that sophisticated computer modeling has taken district manipulation to new extremes, and to fix it, the courts might have to learn to do the math themselves.\n_____\n8. An ESPN college football analyst is resigning from one of sports broadcasting\u2019s top jobs because of his concern about brain trauma.\n\u201cI can just no longer be in that cheerleader\u2019s spot,\u201d said Ed Cunningham, a former N.F.L. player.\nIn other sports news, the U.S. Open hosted 87 matches, after all but nine of yesterday\u2019s were postponed because of rain.\n_____\n9. We spoke with the director and actress of a new one-woman show about the Syrian refugee crisis, \u201cOh My Sweet Land,\u201d which will take place in a different private home each night of its New York run.\nThe casting notice had requested an actress \u201cconfident chopping onions and mincemeat,\u201d and Nadine Malouf answered the call. She\u2019ll cook kibbe, the traditional Middle Eastern meat dish, as she tells the story of searching for the Syrian man she\u2019s fallen in love with.\n\u201cEvery kitchen will have a new geography,\u201d explained the director, Amir Nizar Zuabi. \u201cEvery evening will be a new voyage.\u201d\n_____\n10. Finally, it was 40 years ago, on Aug. 20 and Sept. 5, 1977, that a pair of robots named Voyager were dispatched to explore the outer solar system and the vast darkness beyond. See more about their journey in this video.\nOur science writer remembers the days covering the launch from the NASA press room. He never had more fun as a science writer.\n\u201cBack then, we were looking forward to an exploration of space that would go on forever. It was magic, and we were all on the spaceship. What resulted was nothing less than a reimagining of what a world might be.\u201d\nHave a great night.\n_____\nIf photographs appear out of order, please download the updated New York Times app from iTunes or Google Play.\nYour Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.\nAnd don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a.m. Sundays.\nWant to catch up on past briefings?

    "text": "Helping the Rohingya\n2017-09-29T09:00:04.000Z\nHere are some of the organizations responding to the Rohingya refugee crisis. Some are trying to gain access to restricted areas of the western state of Rakhine in Myanmar, where many ethnic Rohingya Muslims remain. Most of the aid has been focused on camps in Bangladesh where hundreds of thousands have fled over the past month.\nMore information can be found through services that track and rate charity groups, including GuideStar and Charity Navigator.\nBRAC, a group founded in Bangladesh, was ranked the No. 1 nongovernmental organization in the world by NGO Advisor. Of the 1,300 staff members directly serving the refugee population in Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh, many are locals who speak a dialect similar to that of the Rohingya in Rakhine State. BRAC has also trained 800 Rohingya refugees as volunteers. The group is now focused on health, education and the protection of women and girls.\nIOM, the United Nation\u2019s migration agency, manages camps and shelters in Cox\u2019s Bazar. In addition to providing healthcare and sanitation, the group is scaling up programs to protect girls, women and others vulnerable to trafficking. IOM employs Rohingya refugees on a casual basis, and most of the 500 employees in Cox\u2019s Bazar are Bangladeshi.\nAction Against Hunger is responding to the Rohingya crisis with 700 staff members and 1,000 volunteers on the ground in Bangladesh, delivering hot meals and water. Health workers are treating malnourished children, while mental health counselors are providing support to refugees suffering from acute stress and trauma. Having been in Bangladesh since 2007, Action Against Hunger is partnering with many local organizations and international groups in distributing food and water.\nUnicef is prioritizing shelter, food and water in its efforts to protect children and women, according to Jean-Jacques Simon, Unicef\u2019s communications chief in Bangladesh. In addition to distributing water daily, the group has plans to install water pumps and deep tube wells in the camps. Malnourished children are receiving therapeutic food and supplements. In a news release on Sept. 17, the group also announced plans to vaccinate 150,000 children against measles, rubella and polio.\nSave the Children has been working in Bangladesh since 1970. In addition to distributing essentials like tents, cooking kits and hygiene kits to the displaced Rohingya, Save the Children is paying special attention to helping children, particularly those who are not accompanied by family members. It says 1,400 staff members and volunteers are currently dedicated to the Rohingya response.\nDoctors Without Borders (also known as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res) has worked in Bangladesh since 1985. At least 2,000 staff members are treating ailments including severe dehydration, diarrheal diseases, violence-related injuries and cases of sexual violence, according to the group.\nThe International Rescue Committee is helping the Rohingya remaining in Rakhine, with 400 staff members and volunteers providing medical care and emergency relief. Sanna Johnson, the group\u2019s regional director for Asia, says its operations are complicated by restrictions from Myanmar\u2019s government, which has banned international nongovernmental organizations from some areas of the state.\nUNHCR, the refugee agency for the United Nations has been working with Rohingya migrants since 1978. Of the UNHCR staff members responding to the most recent crisis, about 150 are in Bangladesh and nearly 30 are in Myanmar, according to Joung-ah Ghedini-Williams, an emergency response coordinator. In addition to distributing emergency aid and shelter materials, the group gives protection and support to unaccompanied children, the elderly and survivors of rape and trauma.\n World Food Program is a United Nations agency that has been distributing high-energy biscuits to migrants as they have arrived in Bangladesh. With 88 employees on the ground, it will continue to address food scarcity through subsidies in rice and nutritional powder.",

Rick Scott surveyed the destruction from Hurricane Irma during a flyover of the Florida Keys on Monday, and the weakened storm moved into Georgia and South Carolina. Here\u2019s the latest.\nThe damage in Florida was not as bad as some had predicted, partly because there was  less flooding than expected. Still, more than 60 percent of residents are without power, and the Keys sustained heavy damage.\nRelief efforts  in the U.S. Virgin Islands come as some residents say they feel ignored. The Caribbean at large, which is heavily dependent on tourism, could take years to recover.\n\u2022 Houston searches for normal.\nHarvey\u2019s floodwaters left the city partially ruined and thousands displaced.

There\u2019s an abstract human figure, too.

    "text": "Not if the Seas Rise, but When and How High\n2017-11-22T13:00:01.000Z\nOnce you\u2019ve read an excellent book about climate change, which Jeff Goodell\u2019s \u201cThe Water Will Come\u201d most certainly is, you can never unremember the facts. Elected officials may be busy arguing about whether global warming is real. But most scientists are having other arguments entirely \u2014 about whether danger is imminent or a few decades off; about whether our prospects are dire or merely grim.\n\u201cSea-level rise is one of the central facts of our time, as real as gravity,\u201d Goodell writes. \u201cIt will reshape our world in ways most of us can only dimly imagine.\u201d\nGoodell has little trouble imagining it. He opens \u201cThe Water Will Come\u201d with a fictional hurricane whipping through Miami in 2037. It sweeps the Art Deco buildings of South Beach off their foundations, disgorges millions of gallons of raw sewage into Biscayne Bay and eats the last of the city\u2019s beaches. Thousands scramble for bottled water dropped by the National Guard. Zika and dengue fever start to bloom (so much moisture, so many mosquitoes). Out rush the retirees and glamour pusses; in rush the lawyers and slumlords. Within decades, the place is swallowed whole by the ocean. What was once a vibrant city is now a scuba-diving destination for intrepid historians and disaster tourists.\nThe whole scenario seems indecently feasible by the book\u2019s end.\nAfter this year\u2019s calamitous flooding in Houston and the Caribbean, \u201cThe Water Will Come\u201d is depressingly well-timed, though I\u2019m guessing all good books about this subject will be from now on. Political time now lags behind geological time: If we don\u2019t take dramatic steps to prepare for the rising seas, hundreds of millions could be displaced from their homes by the end of the century, and the infrastructure fringing the coast, valued in the trillions of dollars, could be lost.\nUnfortunately, human beings are uniquely ill-suited to prepare for disasters they cannot sense or see. \u201cWe have evolved to defend ourselves from a guy with a knife or an animal with big teeth,\u201d Goodell writes, \u201cbut we are not wired to make decisions about barely perceptible threats that gradually accelerate over time.\u201d\nSo we stick our heads in the sand. Until the sand disappears, anyway.\nTo give you an idea of why many climate scientists are so nervous: Over the course of the earth\u2019s history, seas have risen drastically whenever ice sheets suddenly collapsed. And that\u2019s precisely what\u2019s happening now. Greenland is melting at a furious rate \u2014 by 2040, Goodell writes, we\u2019ll be able to windsurf at the North Pole \u2014 and so are the ice shelves of Antarctica.\nMany of our climate reports, including the one that formed the basis of the 2015 Paris Agreement, hadn\u2019t predicted this. Their authors assumed that the most the sea could rise by 2100 was three feet, two inches. Now many scientists believe that estimate is too low. Some say the sea could rise as much as six feet; others say even more than that.\n\u201cFor anyone living in Miami Beach or South Brooklyn or Boston\u2019s Back Bay or any other low-lying coastal neighborhood,\u201d Goodell writes, \u201cthe difference between three feet of sea level rise by 2100 and six feet is the difference between a wet but livable city and a submerged city.\u201d\nGoodell has been writing about climate change for many years. (His previous books include \u201cBig Coal\u201d and \u201cHow to Cool the Planet.\u201d) He\u2019s the real deal, committed and making house calls. In \u201cThe Water Will Come,\u201d partly built on stories he\u2019s written for Rolling Stone, he visits cities in peril around the globe: New York; Lagos, Nigeria; Norfolk, Va.; Miami; Venice; Rotterdam. He speaks to a great many politicians, including Barack Obama, eventually asking some version of, \u201cGiven what you know, aren\u2019t you scared out of your wits?\u201d (Obama\u2019s response: \u201cYeah.\u201d) At an art event, Goodell buttonholes an influential developer in Miami, Jorge P\u00e9rez, and asks several variations of the same question. P\u00e9rez insists he\u2019s unworried. \u201cBesides,\u201d he adds, \u201cby that time, I\u2019ll be dead, so what does it matter?\u201d\nThe full exchange is worth reading. It plays out like something from a Carl Hiaasen novel. All that\u2019s missing are the twin blondes in the hot tub.\nOf all the American cities in this book, Miami seems least equipped to handle a rise in sea level, founded as it is on pleasure, real estate and the inalienable right to not pay state income taxes. (When a local geologist undertook a larger project to show just how much fecal matter was in Biscayne Bay, the mayor of Miami Beach went ballistic.) But every coastal city faces its own obstacles to adaptation, and the problems each one faces are different.\nNaval Station Norfolk, the largest navy base in the world, may have as few as 20 good years left. Yet it\u2019s located in a climate-denial hot spot in Virginia, and it depends on more than a few climate-deniers in Congress for funding. \u201cMany people in the military end up talking about climate in much the way eighth graders talk about sex \u2014 with code words,\u201d Goodell writes.\nNew York City may have more climate-change realists doing its bidding and spending its dollars. But the barrier the city plans to build to protect Wall Street \u2014 you\u2019ve got to protect Wall Street, right? \u2014 could deflect water into poorer neighborhoods. (And let\u2019s not even discuss the fate of the subways.)\nIt is, perhaps, the world\u2019s poor who will suffer most. Goodell devotes a good deal of this book to contemplating their fate. Salty soil has already destroyed the rice crops of the Mekong Delta and Bangladesh. If the sea rises high enough, whole island nations could be washed away. The slum-dwellers of Lagos, Jakarta and other coastal cities in the developing world could be chased from their homes, many of which are already on stilts. The International Organization for Migration estimates there will be 200 million climate refugees by 2050.\nYet even countries with means can\u2019t get their citizens to focus on this problem. \u201cThe average American right now,\u201d Obama tells Goodell, \u201ceven if they\u2019ve gotten past climate denial, is still much more concerned about gas prices, getting back and forth from work, than they are about the climate changing.\u201d\nWater simply isn\u2019t on their minds. They\u2019ve got more pressing concerns to keep at bay.",

A few months later they adopted a white girl. This is what happened decades later, when the two met.\nLong before there were meatless Mondays, there were meatless Tuesdays, wheatless Wednesdays and porkless Saturdays.\nOne hundred years ago, during World War I, the U.S. government made an appeal for the country to sacrifice more to help its allies in Europe avoid starvation.\nAmericans were already encouraged to give up meat (red meat, preserved meat and lard) on Tuesdays and wheat on Wednesdays. The new instructions also excluded pork on Saturday and recommended one meal without meat or wheat each day.\n\u201cIn this emergency, only the simplest of living is patriotic,\u201d said Herbert Hoover, food administrator and a future president.\nIn that crucial winter, he said, \u201clies the period when there will be tested in this great free country of ours the question as to whether or not our people are capable of voluntary individual self-sacrifice to save the world.\u201d\nThe guidelines were later tightened again, and declared a success.\nAnother plea to help those struggling in Europe came after World War II. President Harry Truman, in the first televised address from the White House, asked Americans to give up meat on Tuesdays and poultry and eggs on Thursdays.\n\u201cWe must not fail them,\u201d he said.\nSarah Anderson contributed reporting.\n_____\nYour Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

While information contained in it is based on real posts and real events, the feed and characters depicted within it have been created for illustrative purposes. Section 1: INTRO On the surface Facebook seems pretty straight forward. You use it to spy on exes and make people jealous about that vacation you took that was actually a disaster. But in becoming such a central part of day-to-day communications Facebook has transformed into its own geopolitical force. One in five minutes spent online are spent on Facebook. It\u2019s a cyber kingdom with a population of over 2 billion. That power has made the leaders of many countries feel threatened. So governments have started to push back, attempting to regain some control over how their citizens communicate. Our story begins here \u2014 where the fight between companies and countries has begun fragmenting the internet itself. TITLE: How Facebook is Changing Your Internet To understand Facebook\u2019s role in how the internet is breaking apart, you first have to leave the U.S. Zuck: \u201cIts great to be here in Barcelona with you\u201d Zuck: \u201cIts great to be here in Berlin\u201d Zuck: \u201cIts great to be here in India\u201d Zuck: \u201cI Wanted to come to Legos first\u201d Want to win an election in Ecuador? Are you trying to build a business in Brazil? Network in the Netherlands? Or are you trying to have your single go no. 1 in Senegal? It doesn\u2019t matter where you are or what you\u2019re doing \u2014 Facebook has become a necessity for real world success. Section 2: Expansion Model In part, that\u2019s because the company has gone through extreme efforts to reach far flung corners of the globe. They\u2019re putting satellites into space and developing internet-beaming solar powered drones. Here\u2019s one taking off now. 1. Zuck: \u201cConnectivity can\u2019t be a privilege for just the rich and powerful. (It needs to be something that everyone shares, an opportunity for everyone.\u201d) The company is subsidizing connectivity in the developing world with the mission to make Facebook accessible to all. Here on the outskirts of Nairobi, Facebook made a deal with a telecom provider and now customers of that company can use Facebook free of charge. For those users, Facebook might be their entire experience of the internet. \u201cIf you grew up and never had a computer and you\u2019ve never used the internet and someone asked you if you wanted a data plan, you response would probably also be \u201cwhat\u2019s a data plan and why would I want one?\u201d They call it \u201cFree Basics\u201d a kind of mini version of the internet that gives users free access to Facebook and a few other sites. They\u2019re rolling it out in developing countries all around the world. So why does it matter if they gives away free Facebook access? KENYA - EX: 1 of Unintended Consequence Let\u2019s say you live in Nairobi and your name is Phyl. You find some cheap handbags made of the finest chinese pleather and decide to sell them online. With Facebook offering free internet and just about everyone you know using the site, you decide there\u2019s no need to pay for a shop, so you snap a photo of a blue bag, post it on your facebook page and soon customers from across East Africa are liking your photo. Some people even place orders, even a few who don\u2019t have a data plan because they\u2019re using Facebook\u2019s free version of the internet. They\u2019re happy because they found a bag and didn\u2019t pay any sales tax or data fees. Your happy because you avoided renting a shop and got cash. So life is good. But then you realize, your entire economic existence is resting in the hands of a coder in a hoody who loves avocado toast sitting in Silicon Valley. The more you think about it, the more uncertainty there is. What would happen if Facebook decided to start taking a cut of your business? Or what would happen if the Kenyan government added fees to Facebook, would they pass it on to you? And what if you decided to cut them out and go straight to the customer yourself? How could you possibly have a chance against Facebook? Questions like these, have led some critics to compare Facebook\u2019s dominance in places like Kenya to a form of digital colonialism. For Kenyans, these issues are still theoretical, but for others the issues are much more real. JAKARTA - Ex: of Unintended Consequence #2 Let\u2019s say you live in Indonesia and you\u2019re a devout Muslim man. You\u2019re not convinced about this whole internet thing and you don\u2019t want to spend a good chunk of your monthly income to get a connection. But your daughter keeps telling you, the internet thing really is a thing. So she sets you up with Facebook\u2019s free version of the internet. Online you discover cat videos are surprisingly fun to watch. Then you see a video of your mayor. In it, he appears to say the Quran is lying. You can\u2019t believe it. The video has millions of hits. NAT POP MAYOR AHOK: \u201cThus ladies and gentlemen, if you feel that you can\u2019t vote for me because you\u2019re afraid you will go to hell, you are being lied to, but that\u2019s alright because this is your personal calling.\u201d In response, you and hundreds of thousands of other people come out to protest calling for the mayor to be removed from office. Six-months-later he\u2019s voted out of office. But the problem is \u2014 the video that got you so angry was edited to make the statement seem more provocative than it actually was. But you don\u2019t know that. And you don\u2019t even have the ability to seek out other information because Facebook\u2019s free version of the internet only gives you access to a few sites. So you\u2019re left only with \u2014 A Facebook reality. Section 3: Cause And Facebook\u2019s reality is one that\u2019s based on an algorithm. And that algorithm rewards engagement, which often means prioritizing inflammatory posts. Combine that with Facebook\u2019s ambitious mission to bring internet to the developing world and you\u2019ve got a problem. On one hand, Facebook\u2019s efforts bring information to more of the world than ever before. On the other hand, you have the world as it looks today, where guys like your Uncle Joe bicker on behalf of candidates using rumors and propaganda. Trump Supporter: \u201cFuck political correctness, Build the wall!\u201d This is a space where protests flare up around lies and measured voices are shouted down by radical ones. Duterte Nat Pop: \u201cPresident Obama is a son of a whore\u201d Trump nat pop: \u201cWe will have so much winning if I get elected\u201d Wilders: There is lots of Moroccan scum in Holland Mr. Zuckerberg has said the company is working on squashing fake news, but the problem goes further into what gets promoted and why. But for Facebook, there isn\u2019t a lot of incentive to cut down on the half truths and misconceptions. Its main goal is to hold its audience captive and grow its community ever larger. Written Quote on Screen: \u201cGrowth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell.\u201d At stake is the future of the internet itself. Facebook and only a handful of other major internet companies control our online lives, and each is aggressively trying to expand. Does the Kenyan government care if Facebook has allowed Phyl to circumnavigate their tax system? Does the Indonesian government care that 200,000 people are in their streets protesting? The answer is yes. Section 4: Effect The end result pits countries against companies. And not all governments are willing to cede power to Facebook. So they create new laws to govern their country\u2019s digital space that cater to their interests. This goes against the way the internet was original supposed to work, as a way for people to share information without borders or rules. Now, Instead of one internet \u2014 there are many. Some are controlled by countries, others by companies. And everyone wants more control. Section 5: China Comparison There\u2019s no better place to see the fragmentation of the internet than in China. Nat Pop Zuck: Xin Nian Kuai Le China\u2019s internet is cut off from the rest of the world by filters that keep websites like Facebook from working. Tank Man Clip It\u2019s sort of an anti-internet. Instead of facilitating free communication, it often works as a means to control that communication. Instead of connecting China to the world, it cuts it off. According to China\u2019s internet, this event never even happened. But if you compare China\u2019s internet to Facebook, some uncomfortable parallels emerge. While facebook lets you post plenty of articles and links from the greater internet, it also operates by its own rules. Just like China\u2019s internet, a central authority tracks what you do and decides what you see. Most of the time your feed is hiding a baby photo from that girl Jane who may have been in your 4th grade class, but you can\u2019t quite remember. But sometimes it\u2019s hiding more. For example, these images were all banned from Facebook because they didn\u2019t meet its community standards and now they\u2019re in this video. We think it\u2019s important to show them, but because we did, Facebook could now block our video. [Cut to black] OUTRO The question is: Whose values are we following? Should we cater to the values of Facebook\u2019s algorithm and policies in order to be heard? Even understanding Facebook\u2019s values can be difficult. In many places they promote free speech, yet in others, they are willing to consider censoring. They push for encryption in some places, but turn around and in other places to fight privacy laws that would damage their ad business. That inconsistency is driving fragmentation. And while Facebook claims to be connecting people, they\u2019re doing it their way, with their rules. And you don\u2019t really have a say in it. That\u2019s because Facebook isn\u2019t a democracy, it\u2019s a business. And their business interests are changing the future of your internet. ENDIT\n\u2022 A clash is brewing between America\u2019s tech giants and an increasing number of governments worried about the companies\u2019 influence and reach. Many regulators are mimicking Europe\u2019s stance on digital privacy, using tougher rules to control how parts of the internet are run.\nOur correspondents looked at how Facebook, which is used by more than two billion people each month, tries to win over wary regulators. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s a grand power struggle,\u201d said David Reed, an early pioneer of the internet.\nOur media columnist argues that Facebook should reveal more about what it knows about Russian interference in last year\u2019s U.S. presidential election.\nToday, the European Commission is expected to publish a list of options for taxing technology companies.\n_____\n\u2022 Across the world, more people are now obese than underweight.\nWestern food companies like Nestl\u00e9 are aggressively expanding in developing nations, contributing to a new epidemic of diabetes and heart disease, chronic illnesses that are fed by soaring rates of obesity in places that struggled with hunger and malnutrition just a generation ago.\n\u2022 New technologies are testing the limits of computer semiconductors.

We couldn\u2019t figure out what it was.\u201d\nBut he added that he believed it was impossible \u201cto have space people from other planets or other stars\u201d come to Earth.\nWhile he didn\u2019t believe they could visit us, Mr. Carter did record a message for \u201cpossible unknown civilizations in the galaxies\u201d as president.

Security Council as punishment for the North\u2019s nuclear and missile tests.\nThe crackdown came as President Trump offered rare words of praise for Kim Jong-un, making an apparent reference to his country\u2019s decision to wait \u201ca little more\u201d before acting on plans to launch ballistic missiles toward Guam.\nIn another hopeful sign, joint military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea, shown above in 2016, could provide an opening to reduce tensions over the North\u2019s nuclear program.\n_____\n\u2022 President Trump\u2019s support from corporate America continued to crumble.\nThe president\u2019s main advisory council of business executives disbanded over his remarks equating activists protesting racism with the hate groups who rampaged in Virginia, over the weekend.\nMr. Trump\u2019s remarks also stunned TV hosts, left historians trying to explain and, as our political team pointed out, he managed to boost the white nationalist movement as no president has done in generations.\nBarack Obama\u2019s response to the violence in Charlottesville, with a quote from Nelson Mandela, elicited a different reaction: It quickly became the most-liked tweet ever.\n_____\n\u2022 The hacker is known only by his online alias \u201cProfexer.\u201d\nBut for the first time, an actual witness, a Ukrainian malware expert, has emerged in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and he has been interviewed by the F.B.I.\nThere is no evidence that Profexer worked, at least knowingly, for Russia\u2019s intelligence services, but his malware apparently did.\n_____\n\u2022 In Australia, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, above, took issue with the city of Yarra after its council unanimously voted against recognizing Jan. 26 as Australia Day.\n\u201cAn attack on Australia Day is a repudiation of the values the day celebrates: freedom, a fair go, mateship and diversity,\u201d Mr. Turnbull said.\nThe day is meant to honor the country\u2019s first European settlement, in 1788, but Indigenous communities call it \u201cSurvival Day\u201d or \u201cInvasion Day.\u201d\n_____\n\u2022 Taiwan\u2019s athletes have long had to compete as \u201cChinese Taipei\u201d rather than \u201cTaiwan\u201d in international competitions, like the Olympics.\nBut now, as it prepares for one of the biggest sporting events ever to be held there \u2014 the 29th Summer Universiade \u2014 the whole island is getting the label.\nAbove, a subway car decorated for the event.\n\u2022 Tencent, the Chinese internet giant, bowed to political pressure and restricted the amount of time users can play Honor of Kings \u2014 a smartphone game whose popularity has alarmed Chinese officials \u2014 but fake accounts and workarounds have kept pace.\nAnd Tencent and Alibaba are among the tech companies that will invest nearly $12 billion in China Unicom, in an effort to overhaul bloated state-run companies.\n \u2022 As Nafta renegotiation begins, here\u2019s a look at how the agreement changed trade between the United States, Mexico and Canada.\n\u2022 A U.S. judge overseeing the case of Takata, the Japanese auto supplier, suspended the lawsuits brought by victims of its faulty airbag inflaters in a bid to smooth the company\u2019s efforts to exit bankruptcy.\n\u2022 Airlines have a dress code, of sorts. Dressing up could increase your chances of an upgrade.\n\u2022 U.S. stocks were up.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said in 1965.\nBut in preaching his message, Garvey unintentionally spawned a religion when he said: \u201cLook to Africa, when a black king shall be crowned, for the day of deliverance is near.\u201d\nIn 1930, Ras Tafari Makonnen \u2014 known thereafter as Haile Selassie \u2014 ascended to Ethiopia\u2019s throne, which was taken as a fulfillment of Garvey\u2019s words. Rastafarians immediately hailed Selassie as Jah, the Black Messiah.\nGarvey was not a follower himself, but Rastafari spread across the globe several decades later with the help of reggae musicians, most prominently Bob Marley.\nSelassie died in 1975, but Rastafarians remained convinced he was the living God. As Marley explained in an interview with The Times in 1977, \u201cMany people, dey scoffers.\u201d\n\u201cHow can God die, mon?\u201d Marley continued. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wrote \u2018Jah Live.\u2019\u201d\nEvan Gershkovich contributed reporting.\n_____\nWe have briefings timed for the Australian, Asian, European and American mornings.

    "text": "Travel Ban, Queen Elizabeth, Netanyahu: Your Morning Briefing\n2017-02-06T19:06:04.000Z\nGood morning. \nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\n\u2022 The U.S. Justice Department urged a federal appeals court to reinstate President Trump\u2019s targeted travel ban, saying immediate action was needed to ensure the nation\u2019s safety.\nAlmost 100 U.S. companies \u2014 including Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft \u2014 filed a legal brief arguing that the order is unconstitutional.\nPresident Trump\u2019s confrontation with the courts may foreshadow years of legal battles, and in Congress once-routine debates have turned into proxy battles over a combative president. Here\u2019s what to watch for this week.\n_____\n\u2022 Mr. Trump, who returned to Washington after military briefings in Florida, has rejected criticism.\nIn a Twitter post, he said polls showing that a majority of Americans oppose his travel order were \u201cfake.\u201d In another, he bristled at suggestions that Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, holds the real power in the West Wing.\nBut the chaos and shock waves at home and abroad appear to be prompting Mr. Trump and his top staff members to begin rethinking their improvisational approach to governing.\n_____\n\u2022 A U.S. task force of influential China specialists, including former government officials and scholars, reports on two years of assessments of one of the world\u2019s most important bilateral relationships.\nSet up during the Obama administration as relations began turning rocky, the panel will recommend ways to pursue U.S. interests given the current political strains.\n_____\n\u2022 Other than a timing error that left the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, briefly hanging outside 10 Downing Street and disagreements over the Iranian nuclear deal and Israel\u2019s advancement of settlements, his meeting with Theresa May was cordial.\nMr. Netanyahu was on his way back to Israel when the Knesset passed a provocative law retroactively legalizing Jewish settlements on privately owned Palestinian land \u2014 a measure almost certain to be nullified by the high court, but one that makes the ascendance of the country\u2019s right wing inescapable.\n_____\n\u2022 Remarkably good public health news: Researchers may have found the tools to stop cholera, the global pandemic that rose from the swamps of Bangladesh two centuries ago.\nExtremely effective treatments draw on studies and tests by a research center in Dhaka. And a vaccine accepted by the W.H.O. is being stockpiled for epidemics.\n_____\n\u2022 In an epic, overtime Super Bowl, the New England Patriots came back from a 25-point deficit to defeat the Atlanta Falcons, 34-28. We also reviewed Lady Gaga\u2019s halftime performance and the commercials.\n_____\n\u2022 Introducing The Daily, your audio news report.\nOur reporter Michael Barbaro runs down the big stories and the big ideas. Fifteen minutes a day, five days a week.\nListen here if you\u2019re on a computer, here if you have an iOS device or here for an Android device.\n\u2022 More than 46 billion digital red packets \u2014 online versions of envelopes of cash \u2014 were sent on WeChat, the Chinese social media platform, during the Lunar New Year period, China\u2019s state-run media reported.\n\u2022 President Trump\u2019s  travel ban has disrupted the business of corporate travel to the U.S. \u201cMany groups will just look to move the meeting elsewhere,\u201d one industry leader said.\n\u2022 The new head of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai, has rapidly moved against net neutrality and consumer protections.\n\u2022 Qatar Airways inaugurated the world\u2019s longest scheduled commercial flight, 16 hours and 20 minutes, connecting Doha to Auckland, New Zealand.\n\u2022 U.S. stocks were weaker. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets.\n\u2022 India\u2019s southern Tamil Nadu state is set to swear in Sasikala Natarajan as chief minister, a confidante of her predecessor: the influential politician Jayalalithaa Jayaram, or Amma, who died two months ago.\nThe opposition has been scathing, the Supreme Court is considering a petition to block the move until it rules on a corruption case against her. [The Financial Express]\n\u2022 An Australian panel investigating child sexual abuse confronted reports of 4,444 allegations involving Catholic priests between 1980 and 2015. [Al Jazeera]\n\u2022 A South Australian senator, Cory Bernardi, is expected to resign from the Liberals to establish a conservative party, despite a flood of pleas from his colleagues trying to save the government. [ABC]\n\u2022 In France, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front, set the tone for her bid for April\u2019s presidential election in a speech with echoes of President Trump that warned against globalization and Islamism. [The New York Times]\n\u2022 The U.N. mission in Afghanistan reported that 2016 was another year of record civilian casualties, expressing particular concern over a 65 percent jump in the number of children killed or injured by explosive remnants. [The New York Times]\n\u2022 The police in Myanmar confiscated more than 4.6 million methamphetamine pills from a Buddhist monk. [The Irrawaddy]\n\u2022 Xiao Jianhua, the Chinese-born tycoon missing since being escorted from a Hong Kong hotel by mainland officers last week, shared something with many mainland billionaires: a preference for female bodyguards. [South China Morning Post]\n\u2022 We\u2019re all busy in the morning, so don\u2019t waste time: Here\u2019s how to do the shortest workout possible.\n\u2022 Two brothers and a sister credit a surprising source for their lifelong closeness: their parents\u2019 ugly divorce.\n\u2022 Recipe of the day: Everyone needs a spicy noodle dish that comes together in less than half an hour. Here\u2019s a great one.\n\u2022 The golfer Aditi Ashok is ranked No. 100 in the world at the age of 18, but she is just the second Indian member of the L.P.G.A. and among the few female professionals in her nation.\n\u2022 Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s sapphire jubilee, marking 65 years on the British throne, brought new coins, a stamp and gun salutes. The only thing missing? The queen, 90, who spent a private and reflective day.\nThe Berlin International Film Festival opens this week with a tale of survival, that of one of the 20th century\u2019s greatest jazz guitarists: Django Reinhardt.\nHe was born in Belgium in 1910 to a Roma family that earned a living playing music from town to town.\nReinhardt started off playing the banjo in Paris dance halls. At 18, he lost the use of two fingers on his left hand in a fire, and adapted with a new technique.\nHe rose to fame in the \u201930s. But with World War II and the Nazi occupation of France, Reinhardt tried to flee, fearing that, as a Roma and a jazz musician, he would be detained and killed.\nInstead, his fame \u2014 and the popularity of an officially discredited art form \u2014 may have saved him.\n\u201cThe Germans used Paris as the base for soldiers to rest and relax,\u201d said Michael Dregni, a Reinhardt biographer. \u201cJazz was the hot music of the time, so they all want to go out and see Jazz, and Django was the biggest star in Europe.\u201d\nReinhardt lived through the war, dying of a sudden stroke in 1953. His legacy lives on in the genre he helped create: Gypsy jazz.\nPatrick Boehler contributed reporting.\n_____\nYour Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings.\nWhat would you like to see here?

Trump\u2019s first news conference since July.\n_____\n\u2022 American intelligence agencies presented President Obama and President-elect Trump with unsubstantiated reports that Russia had collected compromising and salacious information about Mr. Trump.\nThe information is based on memos generated by political operatives who sought to derail Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n_____\n\u2022 The use of torture was a main theme on the first day of a whirlwind week of U.S. Senate hearings on Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet choices.\nIn a joint letter, 176 retired officers urged Mr. Trump not to follow through on campaign vows to bring back torture.\nHours later, his attorney general pick, Senator Jeff Sessions, above, distanced himself from Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to bar Muslims immigrants and investigate Hillary Clinton.\n_____\n\u2022 \u201cThey started coming in like the tide.\u201d\nThat was an official at a refugee camp near Bangladesh\u2019s border with Myanmar, where displaced Rohingya Muslims have fled by the thousands to escape a military crackdown in northern Rakhine State.\nThose in the camp say soldiers burned their villages, shot at random and systematically raped women and girls.\n_____\n\u2022 In Iran, the authorities ignored the opposition chants that erupted at the sprawling state funeral for Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who died on Sunday.\nMr. Rafsanjani, once a staunch conservative, had in recent years become a hero to Iran\u2019s middle class. For many of those involved in the so-called Green Revolution, the antigovernment demonstrations in 2009, he was a lone establishment voice representing their beliefs.\nBy official estimates, 2.5 million people attended the funeral.\n_____\n\u2022 Beijing has increasingly signaled that it wants to take on a leadership role in promoting the Paris agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions.\nChina can\u2019t yet lead by example yet. It\u2019s still the world\u2019s biggest polluter. But a shift is evident: Witness the country\u2019s plans to spend $360 billion on renewable energy sources.\n_____\n\u2022 President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has said he has the names of more than a million supposed drug dealers and corrupt lawmakers. He once promised to kill 100,000 criminals in his first six months in office.\nOur reporter met with local officials and law enforcement officers to determine who lives and who dies in the leader\u2019s drug war. \u201cThere is no certain or easy way to get off Duterte\u2019s list,\u201d he writes.\n_____\n\u2022 President Xi Jinping will speak next week at the opening of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, as China looks to cement its role as a global economic leader.\nMr. Xi will lead a group of Chinese executives that includes Jack Ma of Alibaba and Wang Jianlin, chairman of the Dalian Wanda Group. He will be the first Chinese head of state to address the annual meeting.\n\u2022 Alibaba is going brick and mortar. The Chinese e-commerce giant, which is seeking to acquire Intime Retail, has spent billions buying pieces of the very sector it disrupted.\n\u2022 Yahoo plans to rename itself Altaba if the $4.8 billion sale of its internet business goes through. The name is a play on the single biggest asset that would remain of Yahoo: a 15 percent stake in Alibaba.\n\u2022 Fox News secretly settled sexual harassment accusations against Bill O\u2019Reilly, the network\u2019s top host, last summer.\n\u2022 Auto sales in India plunged in December, a casualty of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s ban on large bank notes.\n\u2022 Most U.S. stocks were higher. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets.\n\u2022 In Afghanistan, dozens of people were killed and more than 80 wounded in an attack on Parliament claimed by the Taliban. [The New York Times]\n\u2022 Dylann Roof, the white supremacist who showed no remorse for killing nine people at a South Carolina church in 2015, was sentenced to death. [The New York Times]\n\u2022 China ordered all textbooks from elementary school to university to push back the start date of its war against the Japanese from 1937 to 1931, and to replace \u201ceight-year war of resistance\u201d with \u201c14-year war of resistance.\u201d [South China Morning Post]\n\u2022 Thailand\u2019s cabinet is meeting to discuss emergency measures for the heaviest rainfall in 30 years. At least 21 people have died in severe flooding in the south. [The Nation]\n\u2022 The World Cup will grow to 48 teams from 32 in 2026, a welcome move for Asia and Africa inclusion. But some see a money grab by the scandal-plagued governing body, FIFA. [The New York Times]\n\u2022 Clare Hollingworth, a British war correspondent who broke the news of World War II and was one of the first Western journalists to report regularly from China, died in Hong Kong. She was 105. [The New York Times]\n(In this new section, we\u2019ll help you start your day right.)\n\u2022 We\u2019ve all thought about it: Can we train ourselves to need less sleep?

The country is beginning an experiment to switch off its FM stations and replace them with digital radio.\nIf the plan succeeds, it could be the beginning of a change in how we listen to radio around the globe. Switzerland, Britain and Denmark are considering the same move.\nNorway, where terrestrial radio remains quite popular, was among the first countries to adopt digital radio in the 1990s. The government\u2019s current effort is aimed at improving audio quality.\nThat was also a goal in the creation of FM radio, which offers staticless, high-fidelity broadcasting. Edwin Armstrong, an American inventor, is credited with figuring out how to transmit sound by modulating the frequency of electromagnetic waves (FM) instead of their amplitude (AM).\nHe later built his own FM station to prove its worth to skeptics, though his triumph was marred by legal battles over patents.\nThe New York Times called Armstrong one of the \u201cgreat inventive geniuses in electrical engineering\u201d after his death in 1954. \u201cHe always preferred to be the master of his own laboratory. That he was.\u201d\n_____\nYour Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings.\nWhat would you like to see here? Contact us at asiabriefing@nytimes.com.",

    "text": "Hurricane Irma, Mexico City, Rohingya: Your Weekend Briefing\n2017-09-10T10:00:53.000Z\nHere are the week\u2019s top stories, and a look ahead. \n1.  Hurricane Irma churned through the Florida Keys after leaving a trail of destruction across the Caribbean, with at least 25 people confirmed dead.\nContrary to predictions, the storm is expected to rake Florida\u2019s west coast, potentially exposing St. Petersburg \u2014 not Miami or even Tampa \u2014 to a direct hit. Above, awaiting the arrival of Hurricane Irma in Jensen Beach, Fla., on Saturday.\n\u201cThe biggest thing you can do now is pray,\u201d Gov. Rick Scott said.\nWe have journalists deployed through the region, and digital access to all storm news is free. Here\u2019s a map of Irma\u2019s path and a quick guide to our full coverage.\n_____\n2. The most powerful quake to hit Mexico in 100 years struck off its Pacific Coast late Thursday, rattling millions of residents of Mexico City and claiming at least 36 lives.\nWith the monster quake, four hurricanes, flooding across South Asia and a wave of raging wildfires in the western U.S. \u2014 not to mention the recent solar eclipse and renewed fears of nuclear war \u2014 you could be forgiven for thinking apocalyptic thoughts.\nAs one science fiction writer put it, \u201cThese aren\u2019t the End Times, but it sure as hell feels like the End Times are getting in a few dress rehearsals right about now.\u201d\n_____\n3. The U.S. is pressing for a U.N. Security Council vote by Monday on tough, sweeping measures against North Korea, including an oil embargo, the authorization to board its ships, and a freeze on the assets of the leader, Kim Jong-un.\nRussia and China are likely to block the resolution. Above, the North celebrated its founding day in Pyongyang on Saturday.\nMeanwhile, the White House and the Pentagon are scrambling to decide how to react if North Korea demonstrates that it can send missiles to Guam, or a distance equivalent to striking the West Coast.\n_____\n4. President Trump rejected Republican complaints about his decision to work with Democrats, including Senator Chuck Schumer, above, on fiscal and immigration issues, while the House passed a deal to raise the debt ceiling and fund hurricane relief.\nWe compiled the best writing from the right and left on Mr. Trump\u2019s split with the Republican leadership. On our podcast \u201cThe New Washington,\u201d Mr. Schumer, the Senate minority leader, offers his take on the unexpected alliance.\nJanet Napolitano, the president of the University of California system, filed a lawsuit accusing the White House of violating constitutional due process by abruptly ending the DACA program, which she helped to create as secretary of homeland security in 2012.\n_____\n5. A Times investigation, along with new cybersecurity research, revealed new layers of Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election, tracking how a legion of Russian-controlled counterfeit Facebook and Twitter accounts spread messages critical of Hillary Clinton and promoted material hacked from Democratic emails.\nOn Thursday, Donald Trump Jr., above right, denied colluding with Russia in an appearance before Senate investigators, saying it was concerns about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201cfitness\u201d to be president that prompted him to set up a June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer.\nMrs. Clinton has her say in her book \u201cWhat Happened,\u201d which comes out on Tuesday. Our White House correspondent read an advance copy, and calls it \u201cangry and unsparing\u201d \u2014 especially toward the former F.B.I. director James Comey.\n_____\n6. Equifax is scrambling to contain the legal and financial fallout from a hack that compromised the personal and confidential information of nearly half the population of the U.S. \u2014 including Social Security numbers.\n\u201cSo, Equifax, I have to ask,\u201d our tech columnist writes of the consumer credit reporting agency. \u201cNow that you have failed at your one job, why should you be allowed to keep doing it?\u201d\nAnd our personal finance columnist helps steer you through the company\u2019s confusing instructions on what to do next.\n_____\n7. This week\u2019s Times Magazine is dedicated to education. The cover story, by Nikole Hannah-Jones, reports on the resegregation occurring in schools across the country.\nShe zeros in on Gardendale, Ala., whose court battle to secede from its school district tells a compelling story of the fragile process of racial integration in America. Above, the Gardendale high school.\n_____\n8.

    "text": "Instant Divorce, North Korea, Afghanistan: Your Wednesday Briefing\n2017-08-22T20:00:59.000Z\nGood morning. \nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\n\u2022 Our Washington team looked at how President Trump developed his new strategy for Afghanistan, one that would require thousands more American troops but place more conditions on the Afghan government.\nMilitary and intelligence officials in Pakistan said the new U.S. strategy might worsen relations between the countries. And our bureau chief in Kabul examined how the enemy in Afghanistan, the Taliban, has evolved into a more tenacious foe.\nMr. Trump heads to Arizona today, where the city of Phoenix is bracing for large protests near his first public event since he was widely condemned for his comments on the violence this month in Virginia. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the Trump rally.\n_____\n\u2022 The Trump administration imposed new sanctions on China and Russia as part of its campaign to pressure North Korea to stop its development of nuclear weapons and missiles.\nThe new sanctions affect six individuals and 10 organizations with financial ties to Pyongyang\u2019s weapons program. We tried to answer a big question in the standoff: Can North Korea actually hit the U.S. with a nuclear weapon?\nAnd an American soldier, James Joseph Dresnok, who defected to North Korea in 1962, died after living there for more than 50 years, two of his sons told a pro-North Korea website.\n_____\n\u2022 The commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Adm. Scott H. Swift, above, confirmed that divers found the remains of missing American sailors in the flooded compartments of the Navy destroyer John S. McCain, which collided with an oil tanker off the coast of Singapore.\nThe commander declined to say how many bodies had been located. Ten sailors had been missing since the accident.\nA string of Navy accidents on the Pacific\u2019s western edge not only has raised doubts about its operations, but damaged U.S. prestige and deepened doubts from Asian allies about Washington\u2019s commitment to the region.\n_____\n\u2022 In a major victory for women\u2019s rights, India\u2019s top court voted to outlaw a legal provision that allowed Muslim men to instantly divorce their wives by saying the word \u201ctalaq\u201d \u2014 Arabic for divorce \u2014 three times.\nMen could do the \u201ctriple talaq\u201d in person, by letter or even over the phone. By contrast, a Muslim woman in India seeking a divorce must generally gain the permission of her husband, a cleric or other Islamic authorities.\n_____\n\u2022 An expected visit by Pope Francis to Myanmar has set off intense debate about how hard-line Buddhist nationalists will react to any support he may pledge to the Rohinyga.\nThere had been speculation in recent weeks about whether the pope\u2019s visit, which would precede his trip to Bangladesh, would include a side trip to Rakhine State \u2014 and how hard-line Buddhist nationalists such as Ashin Wirathu might react.\nThe visit would be the first to Myanmar by any pope.\n_____\n\u2022 And Frederik, the Crown Prince of Denmark, above left, was barred \u2014 temporarily, at least \u2014 from a bar in Brisbane.\nThe episode drew more attention to a new state law that has disappointed Australians and tourists alike by requiring that their identification be scanned to get into certain bars after 10 p.m.\n\u2022 China is struggling to revive its industrial heartland where unproductive, debt-laden factories are losing business as China\u2019s growth slows. The city of Shenyang is a crucial test.\n\u2022 Company names in China must now meet official criteria on taste, political sensitivity and length to win approval. Hangzhou Looking for Trouble Internet Technology could not be reached for comment.\n\u2022 Hackers have discovered that a central element of online security \u2014 the mobile phone number \u2014 is also one of the easiest to steal.\n\u2022 Three Chinese shoemakers must pay New Balance $1.5 million for infringing the American sportswear company\u2019s signature logo. Lawyers say is the largest trademark infringement award ever granted to a foreign business in China.\n\u2022 U.S. stocks were up. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets.\n\u2022 An earthquake in Italy struck near the island of Ischia, a tourist spot off the coast of Naples, killing two women and injuring dozens of other people.

Or Texans for \u2026 decades. But on this day in 1784, settlers in western North Carolina declared an independent state. They were concerned that the state and national governments, which were in a debate over debts related to the Revolutionary War, did not have their best interests at heart.\nThe State of Franklin, in what is now eastern Tennessee, adopted a constitution with power divided among three branches, like the national government that its leaders hoped one day to join.\nThe state made treaties, levied taxes and set salaries, but not in currency. Instead, those salaries included 1,000 deer skins a year for the governor, 500 raccoon skins for the governor\u2019s secretary and a single mink skin for the constable for each warrant signed, according to one account published in The Times in 1852.\nOfficials sought the help of Benjamin Franklin, but hopes of national recognition were never realized. The state only lasted a few years because of internal dissent and external pressure.\nBut it had an impact. Franklin was eventually absorbed into Tennessee, and its leader, John Sevier, became Tennessee\u2019s first governor when it joined the union in 1796.\nSarah Anderson contributed reporting.\n_____\nWe have briefings timed for the Australian, Asian, European and American mornings.

    "text": "The World Once Laughed at North Korean Cyberpower. No More.\n2017-10-15T20:55:21.000Z\nWhen North Korean hackers tried to steal $1 billion from the New York Federal Reserve last year, only a spelling error stopped them. They were digitally looting an account of the Bangladesh Central Bank, when bankers grew suspicious about a withdrawal request that had misspelled \u201cfoundation\u201d as \u201cfandation.\u201d\nEven so, Kim Jong-un\u2019s minions still got away with $81 million in that heist.\nThen only sheer luck enabled a 22-year-old British hacker to defuse the biggest North Korean cyberattack to date, a ransomware attack last May that failed to generate much cash but brought down hundreds of thousands of computers across dozens of countries \u2014 and briefly crippled Britain\u2019s National Health Service.\nTheir track record is mixed, but North Korea\u2019s army of more than 6,000 hackers is undeniably persistent, and undeniably improving, according to American and British security officials who have traced these attacks and others back to the North.\nAmid all the attention on Pyongyang\u2019s progress in developing a nuclear weapon capable of striking the continental United States, the North Koreans have also quietly developed a cyberprogram that is  stealing hundreds of millions of dollars and proving capable of unleashing global havoc.\nUnlike its weapons tests, which have led to international sanctions, the North\u2019s cyberstrikes have faced almost no pushback or punishment, even as the regime is already using its hacking capabilities for actual attacks against its adversaries in the West.\nAnd just as Western analysts once scoffed at the potential of the North\u2019s nuclear program, so did experts dismiss its cyberpotential \u2014 only to now acknowledge that hacking is an almost perfect weapon for a Pyongyang that is isolated and has little to lose.\nThe country\u2019s primitive infrastructure is far less vulnerable to cyberretaliation, and North Korean hackers operate outside the country, anyway. Sanctions offer no useful response, since a raft of sanctions are already imposed. And Mr. Kim\u2019s advisers are betting that no one will respond to a cyberattack with a military attack, for fear of a catastrophic escalation between North and South Korea.\n\u201cCyber is a tailor-made instrument of power for them,\u201d said Chris Inglis, a former deputy director of the National Security Agency, who now teaches about security at the United States Naval Academy. \u201cThere\u2019s a low cost of entry, it\u2019s largely asymmetrical, there\u2019s some degree of anonymity and stealth in its use. It can hold large swaths of nation state infrastructure and private-sector infrastructure at risk. It\u2019s a source of income.\u201d\nMr. Inglis, speaking at the Cambridge Cyber Summit this month, added: \u201cYou could argue that they have one of the most successful cyberprograms on the planet, not because it\u2019s technically sophisticated, but because it has achieved all of their aims at very low cost.\u201d\nIt is hardly a one-way conflict: By some measures the United States and North Korea have been engaged in an active cyberconflict for years.\nBoth the United States and South Korea have also placed digital \u201cimplants\u201d in the Reconnaissance General Bureau, the North Korean equivalent of the Central Intelligence Agency, according to documents that Edward J. Snowden released several years ago. American-created cyber- and electronic warfare weapons were deployed to disable North Korean missiles, an attack that was, at best, only partially successful.\nIndeed, both sides see cyber as the way to gain tactical advantage in their nuclear and missile standoff.\nA South Korean lawmaker last week revealed that the North had successfully broken into the South\u2019s military networks to steal war plans, including for the \u201cdecapitation\u201d of the North Korean leadership in the opening hours of a new Korean war.\nThere is evidence Pyongyang has planted so-called digital sleeper cells in the South\u2019s critical infrastructure, and its Defense Ministry, that could be activated to paralyze power supplies and military command and control networks.\nBut the North is not motivated solely by politics: Its most famous cyberattack came in 2014, against Sony Pictures Entertainment, in a largely successful effort to block the release of a movie that satirized Mr. Kim.\nWhat has not been disclosed, until now, is that North Korea had also hacked into a British television network a few weeks earlier to stop it from broadcasting a drama about a nuclear scientist kidnapped in Pyongyang.\nOnce North Korea counterfeited crude $100 bills to try to generate hard cash. Now intelligence officials estimate that North Korea reaps hundreds of millions of dollars a year from ransomware, digital bank heists, online video game cracking, and more recently, hacks of South Korean Bitcoin exchanges.\nOne former British intelligence chief estimates the take from its cyberheists may bring the North as much as $1 billion a year, or a third of the value of the nation\u2019s exports.\nThe North Korean cyberthreat \u201ccrept up on us,\u201d said Robert Hannigan, the former director of Britain\u2019s Government Communications Headquarters, which handles electronic surveillance and cybersecurity.\n\u201cBecause they are such a mix of the weird and absurd and medieval and highly sophisticated, people didn\u2019t take it seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can such an isolated, backward country have this capability? Well, how can such an isolated backward country have this nuclear ability?\u201d\nKim Jong-il, the father of the current dictator and the initiator of North Korea\u2019s cyberoperations, was a movie lover who became an internet enthusiast, a luxury reserved for the country\u2019s elite. When Mr. Kim died in 2011, the country was estimated to have 1,024 IP addresses, fewer than on most New York City blocks.\nMr. Kim, like the Chinese, initially saw the internet as a threat to his regime\u2019s ironclad control over information. But his attitude began to change in the early 1990s, after a group of North Korean computer scientists returned from travel abroad proposing to use the web to spy on and attack enemies like the United States and South Korea, according to defectors.\nNorth Korea began identifying promising students at an early age for special training, sending many to China\u2019s top computer science programs. In the late 1990s, the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s counterintelligence division noticed that North Koreans assigned to work at the United Nations were also quietly enrolling in university computer programming courses in New York.\n\u201cThe F.B.I. called me and said, \u2018What should we do?\u2019 \u201d recalled James A. Lewis, at the time in charge of cybersecurity at the Commerce Department. \u201cI told them, \u2018Don\u2019t do anything. Follow them and see what they are up to.\u2019\u201d\nThe North\u2019s cyberwarfare unit gained priority after the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States. After watching the American \u201cshock and awe\u201d campaign on CNN, Kim Jong-il issued a warning to his military: \u201cIf warfare was about bullets and oil until now,\u201d he told top commanders, according to a prominent defector, Kim Heung-kwang, \u201cwarfare in the 21st century is about information.\u201d\nThe unit was marked initially by mishaps and bluster.\n\u201cThere was an enormous growth in capability from 2009 or so, when they were a joke,\u201d said Ben Buchanan, the author of \u201cThe Cybersecurity Dilemma\u201d and a fellow at the Cyber Security Project at Harvard. \u201cThey would execute a very basic attack against a minor web page put up by the White House or an American intelligence agency, and then their sympathizers would claim they\u2019d hacked the U.S. government. But since then, their hackers have gotten a lot better.\u201d\nA National Intelligence Estimate in 2009 wrote off the North\u2019s hacking prowess, much as it underestimated its long-range missile program. It would be years before it could mount a meaningful threat, it claimed.\nBut the regime was building that threat.\nWhen Kim Jong-un succeeded his father, in 2011, he expanded the cybermission beyond serving as just a weapon of war, focusing also on theft, harassment and political-score settling.\n\u201cCyberwarfare, along with nuclear weapons and missiles, is an \u2018all-purpose sword\u2019 that guarantees our military\u2019s capability to strike relentlessly,\u201d Kim Jong-un reportedly declared, according to the testimony of a South Korean intelligence chief.\nAnd the array of United Nations sanctions against Pyongyang only incentivized Mr. Kim\u2019s embrace.\n\u201cWe\u2019re already sanctioning anything and everything we can,\u201d said Robert P. Silvers, the former assistant secretary for cyberpolicy at the Department of Homeland Security during the Obama administration. \u201cThey\u2019re already the most isolated nation in the world.\u201d\nBy 2012, government officials and private researchers say North Korea had dispersed its hacking teams abroad, relying principally on China\u2019s internet infrastructure. This allowed the North to exploit largely nonsecure internet connections and maintain a degree of plausible deniability.\nA recent analysis by the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future found heavy North Korean internet activity in India, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nepal, Kenya, Mozambique, and Indonesia. In some cases, like that of New Zealand, North Korean hackers were simply routing their attacks through the country\u2019s computers from abroad. In others, researchers believe they are now physically stationed in countries like India, where nearly one-fifth of Pyongyang\u2019s cyberattacks now originate.\nIntelligence agencies are now trying to track the North Korean hackers in these countries the way they have previously tracked terrorist sleeper cells or nuclear proliferators: looking for their favorite hotels, lurking in online forums they may inhabit, attempting to feed them bad computer code and counterattacking their own servers.\nFor decades Iran and North Korea have shared missile technology, and American intelligence agencies have long sought evidence of secret cooperation in the nuclear arena. In cyber, the Iranians taught the North Koreans something important: When confronting an enemy that has internet-connected banks, trading systems, oil and water pipelines, dams, hospitals, and entire cities, the opportunities to wreak havoc are endless.\nBy midsummer 2012, Iran\u2019s hackers, still recovering from an American and Israeli-led cyberattack on Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment operations, found an easy target in Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned oil company and the world\u2019s most valuable company.\nThat August, Iranian hackers flipped a kill switch at precisely 11:08 a.m., unleashing a simple wiper virus onto 30,000 Aramco computers and 10,000 servers that would destroy data, and replace it with a partial image of a burning American flag. The damage was tremendous.\nSeven months later, during joint military exercises between American and South Korean forces, North Korean hackers, operating from computers inside China, deployed a very similar cyberweapon against computer networks at three major South Korean banks and South Korea\u2019s two largest broadcasters. Like Iran\u2019s Aramco attacks, the North Korean attacks on South Korean targets used wiping malware to eradicate data and paralyze their business operations.\nIt may have been a copycat operation, but Mr. Hannigan, the former British official, said recently: \u201cWe have to assume they are getting help from the Iranians.\u201d\nAnd inside the National Security Agency, just a few years after analysts had written off Pyongyang as a low grade threat, there was suddenly a new appreciation that the country was figuring out cyber just as it had figured out nuclear weapons: test by test.\n\u201cNorth Korea showed that to achieve its political objectives, it will take down any company \u2014 period,\u201d Mr. Silvers said.\nA chief political objective of the cyberprogram is to preserve the image of the North\u2019s 33-year-old leader, Kim Jong-un. In August 2014, North Korean hackers went after a British broadcaster, Channel Four, which had announced plans for a television series about a British nuclear scientist kidnapped in Pyongyang.\nFirst, the North Koreans protested to the British government. \u201cA scandalous farce,\u201d North Korea called the series. When that was ignored, British authorities found that the North had hacked into the television network\u2019s computer system. The attack was stopped before inflicting any damage, and David Abraham, the chief executive of Channel Four, initially vowed to continue the production.\nThat attack, however, was just a prelude. When Sony Pictures Entertainment released a trailer for \u201cThe Interview,\u201d a comedy about two journalists dispatched to Pyongyang to assassinate North Korea\u2019s young new dictator, Pyongyang wrote a letter of complaint to the secretary general of the United Nations to stop the production. Then came threats to Sony.\nMichael Lynton, then Sony\u2019s chief executive, said when Sony officials called the State Department, they were told it was just more \u201cbluster,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAt that point in time, Kim Jong-un was relatively new in the job, and I don\u2019t think it was clear yet how he was different from his father,\u201d Mr. Lynton said in an interview. \u201cNobody ever mentioned anything about their cyber capabilities.\u201d\nIn September 2014, while still attempting to crack Channel 4, North Korean hackers buried deep into Sony\u2019s networks, lurking patiently for the next three months, as both Sony and American intelligence completely missed their presence.\nThe director of national intelligence, James Clapper, was even in Pyongyang at the time, trying to win the release of a detained American, and had dinner with the then-chief of the Reconnaissance General Bureau.\nOn Nov. 24, the attack on Sony began: Employees arriving at work that day found their computer screens taken over by a picture of a red skeleton with a message signed \u201cGOP,\u201d for \u201cGuardians of Peace.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve obtained all your internal data including your secrets and top secrets,\u201d the message said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t obey us, we\u2019ll release data shown below to the world.\u201d\nThat was actually a diversion: The code destroyed 70 percent of Sony Pictures\u2019 laptops and computers. Sony employees were reduced to communicating via pen, paper and phone.\nMr. Lynton said the F.B.I. told him that nothing could have been done to prevent the attack, since it was waged by a sovereign state. \u201cWe learned that you really have no way of protecting yourself in any meaningful way,\u201d he said of such nation-state attacks.\nSony struggled to distribute the film as theaters were intimidated. (Ultimately it was distributed for download, and may have done better than it would have.) In London, outside investors in Channel Four\u2019s North Korea project suddenly dried up, and the project effectively died.\nThe Obama White House responded to the Sony hack with sanctions that the North barely noticed, but with no other retaliation. \u201cA cyberbattle would be a lot more risky for the United States and its allies than for North Korea,\u201d said Mr. Silvers.\nBeyond respect, and retribution, the North wanted hard currency from its cyberprogram.\nSo soon the digital bank heists began \u2014 an attack in the Philippines in October 2015; then the Tien Phong Bank in Vietnam at the end of the same year; and then the Bangladesh Central Bank. Researchers at Symantec said it was the first time a state had used a cyberattack not for espionage or war, but to finance the country\u2019s operations.\nNow, the attacks are increasingly cunning. Security experts noticed in February that the website of Poland\u2019s financial regulator was unintentionally infecting visitors with malware.\nIt turned out that visitors to the Polish regulator\u2019s website \u2014 employees from Polish banks, from the central banks of Brazil, Chile, Estonia, Mexico, Venezuela, and even from prominent Western banks like Bank of America \u2014 had been targeted with a so-called watering hole attack, in which North Korean hackers waited for their victims to visit the site, then installed malware in their machines. Forensics showed that the hackers had put together a list of internet addresses from 103 organizations, most of them banks, and designed their malware to specifically infect visitors from those banks, in what researchers said appeared to be an effort to move around stolen currency.\nMore recently, North Koreans seemed to have changed tack once again. North Korean hackers\u2019 fingerprints showed up in a series of attempted attacks on so-called cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, and were successful in at least one case, according to researchers at FireEye.\nThe attacks on Bitcoin exchanges, which see hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin exchanged a day, offered Pyongyang a potentially very lucrative source of new funds. And, researchers say, there is evidence they have been exchanging Bitcoin gathered from their heists for Monero, a highly anonymous version of cryptocurrency that is far harder for global authorities to trace.\nThe most widespread hack was WannaCry, a global ransomware attack that used a program that cripples a computer and demands a ransom payment in exchange for unlocking the computer, or its data. In a twist the North Koreans surely enjoyed, their hackers based the attack on a secret tool, called \u201cEternal Blue,\u201d stolen from the National Security Agency.\nIn the late afternoon of May 12, panicked phone calls flooded in from around Britain and the world. The computer systems of several major British hospital systems were shut down, forcing diversions of ambulances and the deferral of nonemergency surgeries. Banks and transportation systems across dozens of countries were affected.\nBritain\u2019s National Cyber Security Center had picked up no warning of the attack, said Paul Chichester, its director of operations. Investigators now think the WannaCry attack may have been an early misfire of a weapon that was still under development \u2014 or a test of tactics and vulnerabilities.\n\u201cThis was part of an evolving effort to find ways to disable key industries,\u201d said Brian Lord, a former deputy director for intelligence and cyber operations at the Government Communications Headquarters in Britain. \u201cAll I have to do is create a moderately disabling attack on a key part of the social infrastructure, and then watch the media sensationalize it and panic the public.\u201d\nIt ended thanks to Marcus Hutchins, a college dropout and self-taught hacker living with his parents in the southwest of England. He spotted a web address somewhere in the software and, on a lark, paid $10.69 to register it as a domain name. The activation of the domain name turned out to act as a kill switch causing the malware to stop spreading.\nBritish officials privately acknowledge that they know North Korea perpetrated the attack, but the government has taken no retaliatory action, uncertain what they can do.\nWhile American and South Korean officials often express outrage about North Korea\u2019s cyberactivities, they rarely talk about their own \u2014 and whether that helps fuel the cyber arms race.\nYet both Seoul and Washington target the North\u2019s Reconnaissance General Bureau, its nuclear program and its missile program. Hundreds, if not thousands, of American cyberwarriors spend each day mapping the North\u2019s few networks, looking for vulnerabilities that could be activated in time of crisis.\nAt a recent meeting of American strategists to evaluate North Korea\u2019s capabilities, some participants expressed concerns that the escalating cyberwar could actually tempt the North to use its weapons \u2014 both nuclear and cyber \u2014 very quickly in any conflict, for fear that the United States has secret ways to shut the country down.\nThe director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Mike Pompeo, said last week that the United States is trying to compile a better picture of the leadership around Kim Jong-un, for a report to President Trump. Figuring out who oversees cyber and special operations is a central mystery. The Japanese press recently speculated it could be an official named Jang Kil-su. Others are curious about Gen. No Kwang-chol, who was elevated to the Central Committee of the North\u2019s ruling party in May 2016, and is one of the only members whose portfolio is undisclosed.\nThe big question is whether Mr. Kim, fearful that his nuclear program is becoming too large and obvious a target, is focusing instead on how to shut down the United States without ever lighting off a missile. \u201cEveryone is focused on mushroom clouds,\u201d Mr. Silvers said, \u201cbut there is far more potential for another kind of disastrous escalation.\u201d",

    "text": "China Is Reluctant to Blame North Korea, Its Ally, for Cyberattack\n2017-05-17T13:30:43.000Z\nHONG KONG \u2014 North Korea tests nuclear weapons less than 100 miles from China\u2019s border. It launched a missile hours before a major speech by President Xi Jinping of China on Sunday, a move Chinese analysts called a diplomatic slap in the face. Its counterfeiting of Chinese and American currency costs China millions of dollars a year.\nNorth Korea\u2019s history of erratic behavior has embarrassed China in many ways. But through it all, China has remained stoic about its neighbor and ally.\nAs evidence mounts that North Korea may have links to a ransomware attack that destroyed more than 200,000 computers globally \u2014 and hit 40,000 institutions in China \u2014 China\u2019s response has been muted. Which raises the question: How far can North Korea go without getting disciplined by its more powerful neighbor?\nChina has been one of the biggest victims of the attack, which crippled computers at universities, major businesses and local governments, adding a potentially dangerous new element to a relationship that has increasingly tested Chinese leaders.\n\u201cNorth Korea has been a constant threat in terms of missiles and nuclear weapons,\u201d said Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor of international relations at Renmin University. \u201cAll of a sudden, it poses a cyber threat.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThis time if it\u2019s from North Korea, the malware was targeted indiscriminately against all computers. That\u2019s a big change. It harms and threatens China.\u201d\nAmid these tensions, Beijing is not eager to call attention to its deteriorating relations with its longtime ally. North Korea\u2019s missile launch took place hours before Mr. Xi addressed an international gathering in Beijing to promote China\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d project \u2014 an enormous  infrastructure undertaking that is expected to build projects in Asia, Europe and Africa.\nEven though the timing of the launch suggested it was a deliberate ploy to embarrass Mr. Xi at an inopportune time, it was not reported in the Chinese state media.\nRegarding the ransomware attack, China analysts say Beijing will hesitate before directly casting blame on North Korea even if evidence, still inconclusive, directly ties the North to the attack. Beijing is more likely to single out other actors, particularly the United States, experts say.\nThe attack took advantage of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows software through a tool stolen from the United States\u2019 National Security Agency. That plays into broader Chinese concerns about its overreliance on American software.\nChina\u2019s influence over North Korea\u2019s hacking efforts has been significant. By some accounts, the idea to experiment with cyberattacks came to North Korea from China.\nInitially, the North Korean government viewed the internet as a threat. But in the early 1990s, a group of computer experts returned from China with the idea of using the web to take secrets and attack government enemies, according to one defector.\nSince then, North Korean hackers have attended schools in China and used it as a staging ground for attacks. As North Korea devoted more resources to those efforts \u2014 eventually selecting child math prodigies for training and assembling an army of more than 6,000 \u2014 it established a large outpost for its secretive hacking unit in China.\nSecurity analysts say North Korean hackers operate out of hotels, restaurants and internet cafes in northeastern Chinese cities like Shenyang and Dandong, which are outposts for trade with North Korea. Though many still operate in China, North Korean hackers have increasingly moved further afield, to countries in Southeast Asia, where government surveillance and control is less strict.\nThe moves are also intended to protect cyberattack options in the event of a war on the Korean Peninsula. Security analysts say some attacks are also carried out from North Korea, but are limited by the fact that the country has only one main portal to the internet, through China\u2019s state telecom operator China Unicom.\nDespite evidence suggesting a North Korean role in the ransomware attack, the most common reaction among experts and on Chinese social media was to blame the United States.\n\u201cMany criticized the U.S. government, saying that it was responsible for this spread of ransomware. Obviously this accusation is reasonable,\u201d the editor in chief of state-run Global Times wrote in a prominent commentary on Monday.\n\u201cAttacks always happen,\u201d said Chen Zhong, a professor in computer science at Peking University. \u201cWhat catches our eyes this time is that the attack used a tool that leaked from the N.S.A.,\u201d he said.\nOn the social media site Weibo, users almost uniformly blamed the United States for the attack.\n\u201cHell, if North Korea could do this they would have showed it off long ago,\u201d said one user. \u201cNorth Korea would have become a major power if they can pull this off,\u201d said another.\nBut Mr. Cheng of Renmin University said that if events more definitively linked the attack to North Korea, it was likely to pose a new test to China\u2019s increasingly rocky relationship with Pyongyang.\n\u201cSince North Korea started its nuclear program in 2006, China-North Korea relations have gradually deteriorated, and are currently at an abnormal level. If we add another virus, the image of North Korea in the eyes of China will be even worse.\u201d\nChina\u2019s news organizations, both state-run and private, reported on the hacking attacks, as well as the possible links to North Korea, hours after it occurred, but they did so in a controlled fashion that was confined to inside pages of newspapers, and played in modest ways on websites.\nStill, several news portals wrote that cybersecurity firms like Kaspersky Lab had found initial evidence that pointed to North Korea. The news portal Sina pointed to previous attacks \u2013 in Bangladesh, against Sony and the South Korean subway \u2013 that may have originated from the North.\nShould the evidence against North Korea mount, it would add to other indignities China has suffered at the hands of its neighbor.\nOver the years, North Korea has flooded northeastern China with counterfeit $100 bills of American currency. It has also mass manufactured counterfeit Chinese renminbi, but China says little about the problem.\nThis year, South Korea accused the North of assassinating the half brother of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, at the international airport in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. The relative, Kim Jong-nam, was considered a friend of China and he had lived in the Chinese-controlled territory of Macau, where he was protected by state security.\nChinese state-run media reported on the killing but refrained from associating Mr. Kim, the half brother, with China.\nIn 2013, an uncle of Kim Jong-un, who was the main financial conduit between China and the North, was executed by a firing squad that used antiaircraft guns, according to South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service.\nSouth Korean intelligence said the killing of the uncle, Jang Song-thaek, was ordered by Mr. Kim as he was consolidating power over North Korea. His death meant that China lost its most important interlocutor with the North, and was an early signal from Mr. Kim that under his rule relations between China and North Korea would not be business as usual.

    "text": "Runoff Vote Keeps Georgia\u2019s 6th District a Battleground\n2017-04-19T23:58:45.000Z\nATLANTA \u2014 When Jon Ossoff came within a couple of percentage points of winning 50 percent of the votes \u2014 and thus winning outright \u2014 in the special election in Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District on Tuesday, Democrats trumpeted the unexpectedly strong showing in a traditional Republican stronghold. But Republicans were also pleased that they had forced Mr. Ossoff into a June runoff against a seasoned candidate they believe their fractured party can unite behind.\nThis closely watched race in the suburbs north of Atlanta has been widely billed as a referendum on Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency, and local residents are girding themselves for a new bombardment of money and messaging as the two major parties fight for the chance to brand the Republican president as either damaged goods or a wily survivor.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Trump, as divisive and catalyzing as ever, is waiting in the wings, amid speculation that he may be mulling a more personal involvement in the race that could end up stoking Republican excitement, Democratic anger \u2014 or both.\n\u201cI think we could be facing all-out war here for the next two months,\u201d Kerwin Swint, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University in Kennesaw, Ga., said Wednesday.\nMr. Ossoff is a 30-year-old documentary filmmaker virtually no one had heard of until a few months ago. But he has become a sort of instant celebrity as liberals around the country sniffed weakness in a district that previously sent Newt Gingrich to Congress \u2014 but which Mr. Trump barely won in November.\nActivists have filled Mr. Ossoff\u2019s campaign chest with $8.3 million, and more is on the way: On Wednesday, Thomas E. Perez, the Democratic National Committee chairman, sent a fund-raising email encouraging party members to \u201cgo all-in and elect Jon,\u201d and \u201csend a big, loud message to Donald.\u201d\nMr. Ossoff, one of 18 candidates on Tuesday\u2019s ballot, received a little more than 48 percent of the vote. He will face the Republican Karen Handel in a June 20 runoff to fill the seat vacated by Tom Price, who is now Mr. Trump\u2019s secretary of health and human services.\nMs. Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, finished first among 11 Republican candidates on Tuesday night with just under 20 percent of the vote.\nShe has expressed support for Mr. Trump in the past, though not as fervently as some of the Republicans she bested on Tuesday. In a brief victory speech, she did not mention Mr. Trump at all.\nBut in an appearance Wednesday morning on CNN, Ms. Handel said she hoped Mr. Trump would come campaign for her. \u201cIt\u2019s all hands on deck now,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot at stake here.\u201d\nMr. Trump is expected to be in the Atlanta area on April 28 to speak at a National Rifle Association event. It appears, from his Twitter account, that he has taken a keen interest in the race, and has offered his assistance: \u201cDespite major outside money, FAKE media support and eleven Republican candidates, BIG \u2018R\u2019 win with runoff in Georgia,\u201d he wrote Tuesday. \u201cGlad to be of help!\u201d\nBut even if he does not stump for Ms. Handel, his presence will be felt keenly in the runoff, with both candidates facing unique Trump-related dilemmas over the next few weeks.\nIf Ms. Handel keeps a cool distance from the president, she risks alienating the most fervent pro-Trump voters. If she embraces him, she may lend ammunition to Democrats eager to portray Ms. Handel as his tool.\nMr. Ossoff\u2019s problem has to do with outrage. The anger over the Trump presidency has been the rocket fuel that has powered his surprisingly successful campaign, unleashing not only a flood of out-of-state donations, but a formidable army of canvassers and telephone-bank volunteers.\nWhether that level of passion and involvement is sustainable remains to be seen. Democrats have a poor track record of turning up at midterm and special elections, and the June runoff comes during peak vacation season.\nAlan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta, believes that Mr. Ossoff\u2019s supporters will remain motivated enough to return to the polls, and considers the race a \u201ctrue tossup.\u201d He noted that the conservative Tea Party movement, which bubbled up in early 2009, was still going strong enough to have a significant impact on the midterm elections in late 2010.\n\u201cThe anti-Trump sentiment, we\u2019ve seen that persist now since the election,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the indications are that it is still present, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to fade that quickly.\u201d\nGina Rahman, 51, a mother, engineer and yoga instructor who has been volunteering for the Ossoff campaign since February, spoke this week as if she had no choice but to keep working through June. As she coordinated a pro-Ossoff sign-waving group in front of a polling place Tuesday in unincorporated East Cobb County, Ms. Rahman, an immigrant from Bangladesh, said she viewed Mr. Trump\u2019s policies as a flirtation with \u201ctribalism,\u201d and spoke of him as a threat to the environment and the country\u2019s democratic institutions.\n\u201cI ran a marathon,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019ll run a marathon again.\u201d\nCritics say Ms. Handel, 55, is somewhat short on charisma, and note that she lost recent bids for governor and United States senator. But she has a loyal base of support in the district, having served as chairwoman of the Fulton County Commission and chief executive of a local Chamber of Commerce.\nIn her campaign literature, she promotes her classic Republican stances: She is against abortion rights and for gun rights; advocates ending the Affordable Care Act and \u201cbirthright citizenship\u201d; and boasts that she put in place a statewide photo ID system for voters \u201cto ensure only qualified U.S. citizens, not illegal immigrants, are able to vote.\u201d\nShe has criticized Mr. Ossoff \u2014 a champion of abortion rights and other liberal causes who has said he is not running a \u201cpartisan campaign\u201d \u2014 as a \u201clightweight liberal.\u201d\nCharlie Harper, a longtime Georgia Republican operative and publisher of the political news site Georgiapol.com, said that Republicans who had voted for the other conservative candidates would naturally flock toward Ms. Handel, as would donors and prominent party members who were worried about playing favorites when so many Republicans were running.\n\u201cI think they\u2019re going to be very comfortable with her,\u201d Mr. Harper said. \u201cUp until this point it really hasn\u2019t been an even fight. Democrats had everything going for them. They essentially had one unified candidate.\u201d\nJoe Webb, 70, a Trump supporter and retired project manager from Marietta, spent Tuesday waving signs in the district for Bob Gray, a more overtly Trump-aligned Republican. He said he considered Ms. Handel to be a RINO \u2014 a Republican in Name Only \u2014 but said he would be voting for her to keep Mr. Ossoff out of Congress.\n\u201cI thought about it all day, licked my wounds and said, O.K., she\u2019s got a fairly positive track record as a politician \u2014 she did get voter ID in the state of Georgia, which is a major accomplishment,\u201d he said Wednesday.",

    "text": "In Grim Camps, Rohingya Suffer on \u2018Scale That We Couldn\u2019t Imagine\u2019\n2017-09-29T09:00:20.000Z\nBALUKHALI, Bangladesh \u2014 Up to their ankles in mud, hundreds of Rohingya refugees fought to the front of the crowd outside of their makeshift camp. An open-bed truck full of Bangladeshi volunteers was passing by, tossing out donated goods at random: small bags of rice, a faded SpongeBob SquarePants T-shirt, a cluster of dirty forks.\nEntire families sloshed through the rain hoping to grab whatever they could. One boy, no older than 6, squeezed his way to an opening where a pair of oversize men\u2019s jeans came hurtling off a truck. He had to fight off an older boy before he could run off with the prize.\nThere were already more than 200,000 ethnic Rohingya migrants stuck in camps like this one, Balukhali, in southern Bangladesh. But over the past month, at least 500,000 more \u2014 more than half of the Rohingya population thought to have been living in Myanmar \u2014 are reported to have fled over the border to take refuge, surpassing even the worst month of the Syrian war\u2019s refugee tide.\nAs international leaders squabble over whether to punish Myanmar for the military\u2019s methodical killing and uprooting of Rohingya civilians, the recent arrivals are living in abjectly desperate conditions.\nThis is not so much a defined camp as a dense collection of bamboo and tarp stacks. When I visited, children were wandering in the mud looking for food and clothes. There are worries about cholera and tuberculosis. With no toilets, what\u2019s left of the forest has become a vast, improvised bathroom.\nWhile the flow of refugees has greatly slowed in the past week, aid organizations are still overwhelmed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s on a scale that we couldn\u2019t imagine,\u201d said Kate White, the Doctors Without Borders medical emergency manager in Bangladesh. \u201cThis is a small piece of land, and everyone is condensed into it. We just can\u2019t scale up fast enough.\u201d\nFor decades, the Muslim Rohingya of Myanmar, a minority concentrated in the western state of Rakhine, have faced systemic repression by the country\u2019s Buddhist majority, and particularly by the military. But what happened in August, when the military and allied mobs began burning whole Rohingya villages, was so much worse that the United Nations is calling it ethnic cleansing.\nAcross the camps, the escaped all have accounts of fire and cruelty.\nAnwar Begum, 73, sat on the ground, her arm limp below the elbow. She was in constant pain and could hardly focus her eyes. The army, she told me, set fire to her village in Myanmar and cleared the people out. As the civilians fled, one soldier singled her out, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re not welcome in Myanmar,\u201d and smashing her elbow with the butt of his rifle. As her family dragged her away, the soldier had one last thing to say: \u201cBring that to Bangladesh.\u201d\nWhat was once a loose network of camps has become a sprawl. Acres upon acres of forest have been razed to make way for small cities of huts, made from cheap black tarps covered in mud. Across the camp, men are building them as fast as they can.\nEvery medical treatment post here has a line that snakes nearly around the camp. Local doctors and foreign aid organizations like Doctors Without Borders are scrambling to set up more clinics but can hardly keep pace.\nWith just one main road connecting most of the district, aid groups are struggling to reach the most remote camps. In Taink Khali, a nearly 30-minute hike off the main road, an Australian aid agency called Disaster Response Group was setting up a mobile clinic in a tiny shack. Dozens of women and children were waiting quietly in the hot sun.\n\u201cWe\u2019re the first aid these people have seen,\u201d said Brad Stewart, operations manager for the aid group, a small medical assistance organization that most often serves backpackers in Nepal. His team of four ex-military Australians were taping a bottle of hand sanitizer to a tree.\n\u201cThe immediate attention is going to the more established camps,\u201d he said. \u201cOut here, we\u2019re just a drop in a very large bucket.\u201d\nFor the hundreds still coming, they face a dangerous boat ride across the river border into Bangladesh. On Thursday, dozens of Rohingya, many of them children, were killed as a trawler carrying them capsized in the Bay of Bengal.\nTheir bodies washed up on the bay alongside some survivors.\n\u201cThe women and children couldn\u2019t swim,\u201d said Nuru Salam, 22. He had tried to cross with his entire family when the boat tipped in the sea. His son had died and he was waiting to find his wife\u2019s body. \u201cThere are still many more bodies to come.\u201d\nThe physical challenges here are steep enough. But the Rohingya crisis has shaken the entire region, exacerbating already severe sectarian and political strains and worsening the relationship between Bangladesh and Myanmar, in particular.\nThis is not the first wave of Rohingya that Bangladesh has had to absorb. In 1978, around 200,000 Rohingya fled into the country. Most returned to Myanmar after the two governments hammered out a repatriation deal. Another influx came in the early 1990s, as well as in 2012 and in October of last year.\nEven before this latest exodus from Myanmar, the stresses being placed on this already poor country were considerable. Yet some of the locals have shown remarkable kindness.\n\u201cI see that the host community here has been incredibly positive,\u201d said Karim Elguindi, head of the World Food Program\u2019s office in Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh. \u201cI\u2019m still surprised by the humanitarian response of the government and the community.\u201d\nMr. Elguindi has worked in Darfur, the strife-torn region of western Sudan, and he noted that while the sheer concentration of arriving Rohingya was unprecedented and the terrain challenging for aid distribution, the Rohingya could at least count on basic security once they made it to Bangladesh.\n\u201cCompared with Darfur, here they speak the same language,\u201d he said. \u201cThe refugees in Darfur were in I.D.P. camps,\u201d referring to internally displaced persons. \u201cThey were still among enemies. Here, they are relatively safe.\u201d\nWith existing camps beyond their capacity, the Bangladeshi government is racing to convert an additional 2,000 acres of land into settlements for the new arrivals. But a report from a network of United Nations agencies warned that Rohingya refugees had already arrived at the site before adequate infrastructure and services had been set up. The local authorities have begun limiting Rohingya refugees to the camps, setting up police checkpoints to prevent them from leaving.\nOn Sunday, a Bangladeshi cabinet minister said that the government did not plan to give refugee status to the newly arrived Rohingya \u2014 a stance that is complicating efforts to get them more aid. The Bangladeshi government has said it hopes that Myanmar will eventually take back the Rohingya.\nThe Myanmar government, however, has said that it will only repatriate those with the correct documentation to prove they are from Rakhine. It is unlikely that most of the Rohingya who recently fled to Bangladesh brought such papers with them, if they ever possessed them at all.\nSo far, the bulk of the aid effort has fallen to groups of Bangladeshi volunteers. Touched by the stories they have seen on local television, many across the nation have started donation campaigns and driven long distances to give what they can to struggling refugees.\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t just sit at home,\u201d said Abul Hossain, a volunteer who lives six hours north of the camps. \u201cLast week we asked everyone in our village to donate. We drove all night to bring it here.\u201d\nMr. Hossain and his neighbors had hoped to hand the goods over to government workers or foreign aid organizations like the United Nations, but they say they have not been able to find any.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been driving around since the morning looking for anyone to take this,\u201d he said. \u201cSo now, we\u2019re just handing it out ourselves.\u201d\nThis has proved a dangerous method. Last week, CNN reported that a woman and two children were killed in a stampede as a group of Bangladeshis threw food from a truck.\nSince then, assistance has improved significantly. Food distribution points have been set up by the Bangladeshi government to try to lessen the need for the volunteer truck visits. But it is still a challenge.\n\u201cThere are no roads. We\u2019ve been carrying our equipment in the heavy rain,\u201d said Ms. White, from Doctors Without Borders.\nNear his truck at the entrance to the camp, Mr. Hossain unloaded some of his goods as the lines grew around him.\n\u201cWe expect these people will return home one day. For now we will help them \u2014 they are our brothers and sisters.\u201d Then his index finger went up. \u201cBut maybe not forever.\u201d",

    "text": "Pope Francis, North Korea, Jerusalem: Your Tuesday Briefing\n2017-12-25T19:02:47.000Z\nGood morning. \nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\n\u2022 North Korea called the latest United Nations sanctions an \u201cact of war,\u201d and warned that it would continue efforts \u201caimed at fundamentally eradicating the U.S. nuclear threats, blackmail and hostile moves.\u201d\nThe sanctions, proposed by the U.S. and adopted on Friday by a vote of 15 to 0, were the third round this year in a continuing effort to force the North to halt its weapons program and resume negotiations.\nUnder the new sanctions, fuel supplies will be drastically cut, and about 100,000 North Koreans working abroad will be expelled within two years.\n_____\n\u2022 The Myanmar military\u2019s latest campaign of sexual violence against Rohingya women has been so brutal, a United Nations official said, it amounted to \u201ca calculated tool of terror.\u201d\nEven after escaping Myanmar, many Rohingya survivors find themselves vulnerable and commodified in the brokenness of refugee life.\nIn this video, we followed a Rohingya family over four days as they fled to Bangladesh, where hope turned to tragedy. And here\u2019s a closer look at the Rohingya exodus \u2014 one of the most rapid mass departures in modern history.\n_____\n\u2022 A Pakistani film about a rape victim who brings her politically powerful attacker to justice has inspired Pakistani women to expose sexual harassment in a country where the discussion of such topics is often discouraged.\n\u201cVerna,\u201d starring Pakistan\u2019s most popular and highest-paid actress, Mahira Khan, above, was banned by state censors, but a public outcry, fueled by a social media campaign tapping into the spirit of the global #MeToo movement, helped overturn the ruling.\n_____\n\u2022 President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has threatened to phase out jeepneys, the brashly painted passenger trucks that are emblems of Manila\u2019s clogged streets.\nCritics contend that jeepneys, above, are not safe. Twenty people were killed on Monday in the country\u2019s north when a jeepney collided with a bus on the way to Christmas Mass.\nStill, banning jeepneys would pit the populist president against the working poor, who ride and drive them every day.\nSeparately, Mr. Duterte\u2019s eldest son resigned as the vice mayor of Davao City after his teenage daughter implied he had beaten her.\n_____\n\u2022 Christmas is more popular than ever in India, but tensions have dampened celebrations.\nThe local police in central India recently detained 32 carolers and the priests who went to help them. A politician\u2019s wife was excoriated for endorsing a Christmas charity event, and this month, a Hindu right-wing group warned schools that celebrating Christmas would do so \u201cat their own risk.\u201d\nIt\u2019s all part of a broader ideological battle across India based on religious identity.\n_____\n\u2022 Pope Francis used his annual Christmas Day address to warn that the \u201cwinds of war\u201d and an \u201coutdated model of development\u201d were taking a toll on humanity, society and the environment.\nBut Francis also used the opportunity to pray for a positive turn of events: a resuscitation of a two-state solution in the Middle East, the healing of war-torn Syria and Ukraine; the easing of tensions on the Korean Peninsula; and a return to dialogue in Venezuela.\n_____\n\u2022 Rupert Murdoch and President Trump have traveled in the same circles since the 1970s, but they became close only recently. Here\u2019s a look at this new friendship of convenience.\n\u2022 Vice Media built itself from a fringe magazine into a nearly $6 billion global company. But its boundary-pushing culture created a workplace that was degrading for women, current and former employees say.\n\u2022 In this Times video, check out the military-grade crowd-control system developed by China-based Norinco, with water cannons and tear gas launchers. Experts say it\u2019s overkill, but at least one customer \u2014 Venezuela \u2014 disagrees.\n\u2022 Bitcoin is huge in Asia, which accounts for the bulk of trading in the cryptocurrency. But some worry the bubble could harm financial stability.\n\u2022 U.S. markets were closed for Christmas. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets.\n\u2022 Typhoon Tembin is expected to reach Vietnam later today after it battered the Philippines with floods and landslides that killed more than 230 people.

Britain\u2019s monarchy can be big money. And with Prince Harry marrying Meghan Markle next year, tour groups and other companies are ready to capitalize.\nIt\u2019s a mystery that still endures in Australia.\nFifty years ago this month, Prime Minister Harold Holt went swimming at a beach near Melbourne. Mr. Holt, 59, was undeterred by high surf and a minor shoulder injury. He told friends, \u201cI know this beach like the back of my hand.\u201d\nA friend later said the water around Mr. Holt \u201cappeared to boil\u201d and conditions seemed to \u201cswamp on him.\u201d\nHe was never seen again, and his body was never recovered.\nA police inquiry the next year determined that it was nothing more than an accident. An inquest in 2005 officially ruled Mr. Holt\u2019s death an accidental drowning.\nBut his disappearance spurred a wealth of conspiracy theories, including that the prime minister had committed suicide or was assassinated by the C.I.A. One even claimed that Mr. Holt was a lifelong spy for China and had faked his death by boarding a Chinese submarine.\nThose close to him say the sensational manner of his disappearance has overshadowed his legacy. Mr. Holt strengthened Australia\u2019s alliance with the U.S., among others, and he is credited with being the country\u2019s \u201cfirst 20th century prime minister.\u201d\nHis legacy also lives on in another, if slightly macabre, way: at the Harold Holt Memorial Swimming Center in Melbourne.\nIsabella Kwai contributed reporting.\n_____\nYour Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

    "text": "A Mysterious Act of Mercy by the Subway Bombing Suspect\n2017-12-19T00:14:10.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Before Akayed Ullah returned home to New York from his native Bangladesh, and tried to blow himself up with a pipe bomb in a crowded Manhattan subway station, he had one last thing to do \u2014 an all-night bus ride by himself to help Rohingya refugees.\nAfter visiting relatives here in the capital city, Dhaka, he traveled across the country, slept in a mosque and under a tree, and passed out a few hundred dollars of medicine in the crowded refugee camps.\n\u201cWhen he left, he seemed happy,\u201d said his mother-in-law, Mahfuza Akhter. \u201cBut when he returned, he was so upset. He said those people were living in hell, each and every minute.\u201d\nThat lonely trip across Bangladesh in September remains a mystery. Was Mr. Ullah following Al Qaeda, who had just urged Muslims to deliver medicine \u2014 and weapons \u2014 to the Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic group whose members have been raped, brutalized and massacred in neighboring Myanmar?\nOr was he following his own heart, reflecting some sort of inner struggle as he headed toward his first known act of violence and self-destruction?\nA few weeks after his trip, federal investigators said, Mr. Ullah, 27, returned to Brooklyn and began building a bomb out of matchheads and a piece of pipe he found at a construction site. He detonated it on a busy Monday morning, Dec. 11, in a Manhattan subway station, wounding himself and a few passers-by but doing far less damage than he could have. He was apprehended on the spot.\nFrom a bed in Bellevue Hospital Center on Manhattan\u2019s East Side, he has been cooperating with investigators, saying he was inspired online by the Islamic State to strike against the United States for its policies in the Muslim world. Charged with several terrorism-related offenses, he may never get out of jail. In many ways, his is an open-and-shut case.\nBut extensive interviews with more than a dozen friends, relatives and acquaintances, in Bangladesh and the United States, still leave a hole as to why Mr. Ullah did this. He comes across as impulsive, angry, riveted to militant social media and outraged by injustices inflicted on Muslims.\nHe was also described by several people who know him well as loving and giving. And he did not seem hopeless, a classic characteristic of people about to take their own lives, nor was he isolated. He was close to his childhood family \u2014 his mother and siblings \u2014 and he was building a new one.\n\u201cThis is a little different,\u201d said Mohammed Abdur Rashid, a retired army general who now runs a research institute on conflict in Dhaka. \u201cHe had fewer reasons to feel desperate.\u201d\nBangladeshi police officials have put 15 officers on this case. Mr. Ullah, especially his last actions in the Rohingya camp, represents the union of some of their greatest fears.\nBoth American and Bangladeshi investigators say Mr. Ullah was not a jihadist export from Bangladesh, but was radicalized after he arrived in New York in 2011. Before that, he did not seem interested in militant groups.\nBangladeshis are deeply worried about this phenomenon \u2014 young members of the diaspora becoming radicalized overseas. Mr. Ullah is hardly the first. The mastermind of one of the worst terrorism attacks Bangladesh has ever suffered \u2014 the slaughter of more than a dozen foreigners at a bakery last year \u2014 grew up and went to college in Canada. Analysts say it is much easier for young Bangladeshis to be buffeted by jihadist propaganda once they are in the West.\n\u201cYou guys in the West are na\u00efve,\u201d Mr. Abdur Rashid said. \u201cYou give more space for the preachers, the hate speech. We don\u2019t tolerate it.\u201d\nBangladesh is more on guard now than ever. It has become home to the newest magnet for Muslim extremists: the sprawling Rohingya camps along the border with Myanmar.\nMyanmar is a majority Buddhist country, and this year, Myanmar\u2019s army wiped out thousands of Rohingya civilians after Rohingya rebels attacked police posts. Nearly one million Rohingya have run for their lives into Bangladesh, and the Rohingya\u2019s plight has become a rallying cry across the Muslim world.\nAlready agents from half a dozen different Islamist militant groups are circulating in the camps, analysts said, trying to stoke a hunger for revenge.\nIn September, around the time Mr. Ullah was passing out tablets of acetaminophen, stomach salts and other basic drugs in the camp, Al Qaeda issued a call to arms, urging Muslims to bring the Rohingya \u201cmoney, medicines, food, clothing, weapons\u201d and to use their \u201csouls and wealth\u201d to \u201crescue their brothers.\u201d\nIt is not clear if Mr. Ullah was responding to that specific call; investigators in Bangladesh said he was closely following several jihadist websites.\nRelatives said his one-man aid mission to the Rohingyas was driven by his deepening religiosity and a desire to connect with Muslims in peril. Maybe at that moment he could have gone either way.\n\u201cOh, I wish he would have kept doing that aid work,\u201d said Ms. Akhter, his mother-in-law, who has emerged as the reluctant, teary spokeswoman for Mr. Ullah\u2019s family in Bangladesh.\nFor decades, Bangladesh, a poor, almost purely Sunni Muslim country of 160 million people, has been fighting a shape-shifting terrorism problem that has taken the form of highly coordinated bomb attacks \u2014 more than 400 in one day, in one hour \u2014 to slicing up young bloggers with machetes.\nSince it divorced itself from Pakistan in 1971 and became its own country, Bangladesh has veered between secularism and Islamism. Pakistan defined itself as an Islamic country (its official name is the Islamic Republic of Pakistan) and the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh (its official name) tried to define itself in opposition to that, making secularism and tolerance its foundation.\nBut a sizable proportion of the Bangladeshi public never wanted to break off from Pakistan. And over the years, the Islamist hold here has tightened.\nIn Hazaribagh, the packed Dhaka neighborhood where Mr. Ullah grew up, many women wear full veils, just a narrow rectangle of exposed skin around their eyes, and many men keep their beards bushy, their mustaches trimmed and their pants carefully hemmed above the ankle, potential signs of a stricter form of Islam.\nAs a boy, Mr. Ullah and his mother made the rounds in Hazaribagh, knocking on doors and asking neighbors to go with them to the mosque to pray. They were members of Tabligh Jamaat, a peaceful Muslim outreach group.\nThat was about as religious as Mr. Ullah got, his friends said. The son of a grocer, he attended some of Dhaka\u2019s better private schools, like Kakoli High School and Dhaka City College.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t smoke, he didn\u2019t misbehave, he was always cordial, he was the type of guy who couldn\u2019t commit any crime,\u201d said one of his high school friends, Wazidur Rahman, who used to play cricket with him.\n\u201cMy phone kept ringing that whole first night,\u201d recalled Mr. Rahman of the day when Mr. Ullah tried to set off the bomb. \u201cEveryone was asking the same question: \u2018Wait, that\u2019s our Akayed Ullah?\u2019\u201d\nMr. Ullah left Dhaka seven years ago with his parents, heading to New York on an immigrant visa to stay with other relatives who had already been living in the United States. He worked as a driver and part-time electrician.\nBangladesh is a poor, crowded country, a labor factory to the world. Bangladeshis serve as badly paid crews on oceangoing cargo ships, clean up oil wells in Kuwait and drive taxis in New York. It seems every Bangladeshi has a friend or relative working in America or knows someone desperate to get there.\nMr. Rahman said he had recently heard about a squad of 15 Bangladeshis who went to America \u201cthe unofficial way\u201d from Brazil to Colombia up to Mexico and across to Texas; two had drowned in a river.\n\u201cAkayed was so lucky,\u201d Mr. Rahman said.\nWhen Mr. Rahman saw Mr. Ullah again at Mr. Ullah\u2019s wedding in Dhaka in January 2016, it was as if he was meeting a different person. Mr. Ullah had grown a big beard, he was austere and he broke off from the festivities and from catching up with old friends to pray by himself.\nThe Bangladeshi government has been increasingly aggressive toward militant groups, arresting thousands of suspected sympathizers and monitoring mosques, but it has to play a careful game. It is trying to counter the militants but not come across as too anti-Islamist.\nFor instance, Sheikh Hasina, the prime minister, expressed outrage at the first blogger killing in 2013. But after it happened again and then again, part of a wave of assassinations against writers, publishers, gay activists and Hindus that showed the Islamists\u2019 insidious power was only growing, she began to modify her message and said people should be careful what they write about Islam.\nBangladesh\u2019s Islamist political parties, even if not in power at the moment, seem to be shaping the debate. Several intellectuals said they were scared to speak out about friends who had been killed. Islamists have succeeded in branding secularists as atheists; one of the most dangerous things to be called right now in Bangladesh is an atheist.\nMuhammad Jasimuddin Rahmani, a jailed mullah, has urged Bangladeshis to kill those who insult Islam.\nIt was one of his books that Mr. Ullah tried to push on his wife when he returned to Dhaka in early September. The purpose of the visit was to get all the paperwork in order for his wife and 6-month-old son to immigrate to New York. The three were close despite the distance; his family said he would call his wife five to 10 times a day. But during his last visit, he told his wife that Mr. Rahmani\u2019s harsh interpretation of Islam was the one and only Islam.\n\u201cHe seemed to have this hatred for America,\u201d said Monirul Islam, the chief of Bangladesh\u2019s counterterrorism police operations. \u201cWe\u2019re not exactly sure where it came from. Maybe he hadn\u2019t assimilated so well.\u201d\nHasan Rafique, a former member of an Islamist group now trying to work against militancy, said the Rohingya camps that Mr. Ullah visited were now prime recruiting territory for several Bangladeshi and Pakistani militant groups.\n\u201cDefinitely someone helped him around those camps,\u201d Mr. Rafique said. \u201cYou need to find out who.\u201d\nMr. Ullah\u2019s family said they did not know; aid agencies said many people had showed up in the Rohingya camps on their own to pass out food, money or medicine for a few days before melting away.\nMr. Ullah found enormous satisfaction in doing the charity work, his family said. That raises the question of how deeply radicalized he was at that point and how many other young men in similar circumstances might be passing across that same membrane.\n\u201cIt shows you how powerful that propaganda must be,\u201d said Mr. Rahman, his old high school friend. \u201cHow could he forget his friends, his family, his baby\u2019s face?\u201d",

    "text": "Fate of Stateless Rohingya Muslims Is in Antagonistic Hands\n2017-11-03T09:00:25.000Z\nSHAH PORIR DWIP, Bangladesh \u2014 A skinny finger of water separates Bangladesh from Myanmar, and the other night a group of men sat on the Bangladeshi side, peering into the darkness, wondering what was left for them.\nFor these men, ethnic Rohingya Muslim refugees from Myanmar, there is certainly nothing back across the water. Home doesn\u2019t exist anymore. Myanmar\u2019s army wiped out their villages in August, turning their houses, their mosques, their corrals, their grain stores, their fields, even their trees into dunes of ash.\nThe muddy camps just inside Bangladesh, where more than 600,000 Rohingya have since fled, provide no solution, either.\nOfficials from Bangladesh, a very crowded country, insist that Myanmar must take the Rohingya back. But Myanmar\u2019s Buddhist majority drove them out in the first place, creating a climate of hate that vilified the Rohingya as subhuman. Many people in Myanmar insist the Rohingya are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, even though Rohingya have lived in Myanmar for hundreds of years.\nFew ethnic groups on earth have been locked into such hopeless logic, marooned on an international border, unwanted by either side, weary, traumatized, desperately stateless, their very origins in dispute.\n\u201cThe Rohingya are the wretched of the earth,\u201d said Leonard Doyle, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, the agency helping coordinate relief efforts. \u201cNobody wants them. I\u2019m talking about 7-year-olds who have witnessed their parents get their throats slit who are standing in bare feet on the border right now, asking: \u2018What\u2019s going to happen to me?\u2019\u201d\nBangladesh and Myanmar have held rounds of talks about what to do with the refugees, without any Rohingya representatives present. Likewise, the United Nations recently convened a major event in Geneva called the Pledging Conference for the Rohingya Refugee Crisis. Dozens of donor nations and aid agencies were invited but no Rohingya refugees.\nMany Rohingya now worry that without any input from them, their fate is being sealed. It is clear where most would stand if they were consulted.\n\u201cI will never go back to Myanmar,\u201d said an older Rohingya woman named Morjan who spends her days under a plastic sheet in a camp. After her husband and son were slaughtered in front of her, she fled to Bangladesh. \u201cBetter you kill us here,\u201d she said.\nBangladeshi officials have circulated a draft repatriation agreement, specifying how to verify that Rohingya refugees, many of whom are illiterate and do not have a piece of paper to their name, are from Myanmar. The proposal talks of a \u201cfirst batch\u201d of returnees and even mentions logistics and transport.\nBut Western aid officials said privately that this was a charade. The Rohingya would not be returning to Myanmar anytime soon, the aid officials said. But nobody was allowed to come out and say that, because it could alienate Bangladesh, which clearly does not want to host the refugees indefinitely but whose good will is needed right now.\nFurther complicating things, analysts said, was Myanmar stalling the efforts to help the Rohingya, hardly surprising considering how this crisis started. Witnesses have described, in disturbing detail, how Myanmar\u2019s army burned down Rohingya village after Rohingya village, terrorizing and massacring civilians \u2014 of any age, including infants \u2014 with one apparent purpose: to erase the Rohingya from the landscape.\nThe violence is not even over. One Rohingya advocacy group said this week that Rohingya homes were still being burned to the ground.\nEach night here on the border, hundreds of Rohingya keep arriving in fleets of wooden boats that float silently across the mouth of the Naf River, the brackish waterway that separates the two countries.\nA group of New York Times journalists waited in the darkness alongside worried family members as a searchlight on the Myanmar side swung back and forth, back and forth, an eerie metronome moving across the gloom.\n\u201cHow can we talk about repatriation?\u201d asked Tun Khin, one of the few Western-educated Rohingya representatives who have been able to reach out to the international news media. \u201cPeople are still fleeing.\u201d\nBangladesh now finds itself in an impossible situation. One of Asia\u2019s poorest countries, it is home to 160 million people \u2014 half the population of the United States \u2014 squeezed into a space the size of Iowa. The Rohingya refugees have taken over hillsides, chopped down countless trees to build their shelters and put such a stress on the economy of Bangladeshi border villages that prices have shot up threefold, angering longstanding residents.\nFacing international pressure to host the refugees and some domestic pressure to push them out, Bangladesh\u2019s prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, has said that her country would continue to help the refugees on humanitarian grounds but that Myanmar must \u201ctake their nationals back.\u201d\nShe has ordered the army to seal off roads around the camps to make sure Rohingya do not start migrating to towns. Her government has also decreed that Rohingya were not allowed to work or register for local cellphone service.\nWith no way to support themselves, the Rohingya refugees are completely dependent on aid. United Nations agencies such as the World Food Program have been feeding them, while international and Bangladeshi charities have provided medical care, plastic tarps, cooking pots and other basics.\nHow long the Rohingya are expected to stay will affect the next set of issues, including questions like whether Bangladesh or outside groups should begin building schools for them.\nMany Bangladeshis worry that the Rohingya are perfect candidates to be radicalized \u2014 victims of anti-Muslim persecution who are now idle and dispossessed. Retaliation is a theme for the Islamic State and countless other Islamist militant groups, including the Rohingya group that attacked the security forces in Myanmar on Aug. 25, the Arakhan Rohingya Salvation Army.\n\u201cIf they stay where they are living now,\u201d said Anup Kumar Chakma, a retired Bangladeshi Army officer, \u201cthe entire area will become a fertile breeding ground.\u201d\nAnd not only fertile for terrorist recruiters, but also for human traffickers, criminal gangs, prostitution rings \u2014 anyone who preys on the vulnerable.\nFor Rohingya, the conditions in Bangladesh are an uncomfortable echo of the apartheidlike system they were put under in Myanmar, the result of a long campaign of marginalization and dehumanization.\nFor decades, the Rohingya have been pushed around this shoulder area of Asia where the Indian subcontinent and the Southeast Asian peninsula meet. Their lowly status and history of being demonized allowed this latest crisis to happen, analysts say.\nIf the British had drawn the colonial border between what is now Myanmar and Bangladesh a little farther east and south, as Rohingya leaders had pleaded for after World War II, the biggest Rohingya areas would have been become part of Bangladesh. That would have made sense in several ways: the Rohingya are Muslim, like the vast majority of Bangladesh, and their language and culture are very similar.\nBut scholars say that to appease the majority Buddhists and get out of Myanmar as quickly as possible, the British decided to follow the old borders of an extinct Buddhist kingdom. This kept the Rohingya inside Myanmar, where most people are very different ethnically and religiously from them.\nMyanmar\u2019s leaders steadily stripped away their rights, making it extremely difficult for Rohingya to get a government job or a passport, go to school or even be legally married. Government soldiers preyed upon them; revered Buddhist monks openly called them insects and snakes.\nAll this, looking back on it, seems to have been building up to August, when the Rohingya suffered the most comprehensive assault on their existence.\nAccording to dozens of witnesses and human rights groups, after Rohingya militants attacked a string of police posts \u2014 mostly using farm implements as weapons \u2014 government troops rounded up and killed hundreds of Rohingya civilians, creating a panicked exodus.\nMany poured into Shah Porir Dwip, a border crossing and notorious smuggling den somewhat disguised by a collection of scruffy tea shops. It lies just across the water from Myanmar. The air smells heavy here, the odor of rotting fruit cutting through the salty breeze.\nEach evening, Rohingya men sit on a crumbled walkway near the beach, waiting for family members still trying to get out. By 9 p.m., the boats usually start arriving. Without a sound, they materialize from the murk, rowing in from the Myanmar side, engines off, for stealth.\nOn a recent night, one of the heaviest, hundreds of Rohingya refugees splashed out. Many were quiet, and some wept as they waded ashore.\nIt was difficult to tell which men had reunited with their families and which had to return to the camps alone.\nIn the darkness, walking slowly up the beach, the group moved as one.",

    "text": "Solar Experiment Lets Neighbors Trade Energy Among Themselves\n2017-03-13T23:18:21.000Z\nBrooklyn is known the world over for things small-batch and local, like designer clogs, craft bourbon and artisanal sauerkraut.\nNow, it is trying to add electricity to the list.\nIn a promising experiment in an affluent swath of the borough, dozens of solar-panel arrays spread across rowhouse rooftops are wired into a growing network. Called the Brooklyn Microgrid, the project is signing up residents and businesses to a virtual trading platform that will allow solar-energy producers to sell excess-electricity credits from their systems to buyers in the group, who may live as close as next door.\nThe project is still in its early stages \u2014 it has just 50 participants thus far \u2014 but its implications could be far reaching. The idea is to create a kind of virtual, peer-to-peer energy trading system built on blockchain, the database technology that underlies cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\nThe ability to complete secure transactions and create a business based on energy sharing would allow participants to bypass the electric company energy supply and ultimately build a microgrid with energy generation and storage components that could function on their own, even during broad power failures.\n\u201cCommunity members can work both individually and collectively to help meet demand in an efficient way,\u201d said Audrey Zibelman, who recently resigned as chairwoman of the New York State Public Service Commission, which regulates the state\u2019s utilities.\n\u201cIt takes a central procurer \u2014 in this case, historically, the utility \u2014 out of the mix,\u201d she continued, \u201cand really sets the market where they\u2019re not buying and selling to the utility but they\u2019re identifying each other\u2019s need and willingness to buy and sell.\u201d\nThe project is but one example of how rapidly spreading technologies like rooftop solar and blockchain are upending the traditional relationships between electric companies and consumers, putting ever more control in the hands of customers. Across the globe, upstart companies like LO3 Energy, which is designing the Brooklyn experiment with the industrial giant Siemens, are building digital networks that offer the promise of user-driven, decentralized energy systems that can work in tandem with the traditional large-scale grid or, especially in emerging economies, avoid the need for a grid at all.\nIn Australia, where Ms. Zibelman will soon run the nation\u2019s energy markets, a company called Power Ledger announced the start of a residential electricity trading market based in blockchain last year at a housing development in Perth.\nIn Bangladesh, where an estimated 65 million people lack access to a central grid, ME SOLshare has been developing peer-to-peer trading networks of rural households with and without rooftop solar systems. Producer-consumers there \u2014 known as prosumers \u2014 can sell excess power into the network, where neighboring homes and businesses can buy it in small increments with a cellphone.\nAnd in Germany, Sonnen, a leading supplier of home batteries and smart energy products and services, has created a web of about 8,000 customers, both with and without solar on their roofs, who are trading their stored energy among one another.\n\u201cPeer-to-peer is slowly but surely becoming a reality,\u201d said Olaf Lohr, Sonnen\u2019s head of United States business development. \u201cThis really is a very disruptive technology. The customers are also the owners \u2014 they are the producers of the energy. There is no centralized feed-in from one big power plant.\u201d\nIn New York, the Brooklyn microgrid is conceived to work with the conventional grid, which is in the midst of a reboot under Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s directives to make it more flexible, resilient and economically efficient while reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. That effort, known as Reforming the Energy Vision, or REV, includes encouraging the development of microgrids and more active community participation.\nThe ideal power system, said Richard L. Kauffman, who as the governor\u2019s chairman of energy and finance is leading that effort, is one that combines large power plants and transmission lines with clusters of smaller-scale producer-consumers, \u201cwhere electrons can flow in more than one direction and supply and demand of electricity is dynamic \u2014 and that\u2019s different than the grid is today.\u201d\nPeer-to-peer power sharing is consistent with that vision, he said, though a number of regulatory changes are necessary for it to take off.\nThe State Public Service Commission has already taken a few of them, including last week approving new ways to determine pricing for electricity from renewable energy projects that more accurately reflect the value to the grid based on geographic location, timing and other factors yet to be determined. But Lawrence Orsini, LO3\u2019s chief executive, said the state still needed to determine how to define his company and its network of participants before it could get its market up and running, a move he anticipates by June.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing technically infeasible about what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order for transactive energy to take off as a whole, regulators have to be comfortable that markets can actually work this way and, more importantly, that people want markets like this.\u201d\nOver the past year, LO3 has been working to find those people, using Google Earth to identify homes with rooftop solar installations and then knocking on doors to enlist participants, with some success throughout Park Slope and Gowanus.\nOn a block of President Street last year, the company carried out two sales of green electricity credits generated by one homeowner\u2019s solar system to a neighbor across the street \u2014 tiny transactions, but important in proving the concept\u2019s viability.\nThose sales involved test versions of renewable-energy credits \u2014 numbered certificates that are used to track electricity exported from a renewable system to the grid. Utilities, corporations and other customers can buy the credits to claim green energy use.\nIn the Brooklyn case, LO3 used the credit sales, conducted over PayPal, to test its approach; it cannot legally buy and sell electricity until regulators determine its market status. Once that occurs, Mr. Orsini said, the company will be able to facilitate the trading of energy among its participants \u2014 though they would still pay the utility, Con Edison, for infrastructure fees and services, as customers now do when they choose to use a green energy supplier through the utility.\nMr. Orsini\u2019s team is busy collecting data from meters installed in prosumer homes, measuring production, use and export of the solar electricity to help model the market. They are also testing a smartphone app that customers will be able to use to manage their electricity purchases, setting parameters to control the source \u2014 selecting from a range of conventional, renewable, local and bulk options \u2014 as well as how much they are willing to spend.\nMr. Orsini said he expected that most users would want to make their choices and then let the system take over.\n\u201cNo one wants to day-trade energy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re giving something to people that they haven\u2019t ever had before, and that\u2019s really a way to personalize their energy consumption.\u201d\nThat is the aspect that appeals to a number of the participants, including Garry Golden of Windsor Terrace, a futurist who consults for a variety of businesses, including electric utilities and infrastructure companies. Mr. Golden installed solar as part of a group purchase that proved so popular with his neighbors that almost a dozen systems are within view of his roof, forming an attractive cluster for the microgrid experiment.\n\u201cWe need to make energy a product and a service that people can purchase on their own and not rely on a large centralized entity,\u201d Mr. Golden said. He added that it was important to build out infrastructure that would be able to better withstand disasters, both natural and man-made.\nOther participants echoed that concern.\n\u201cThe long-term goal is to be at least partially independent of the grid in emergencies, which was a reasonable argument to join,\u201d said Patrick Schnell, whose Gowanus basement flooded during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, though he did not lose power. \u201cHopefully it will expand and more people will join and it will be more worthwhile.\u201d\nThe project includes plans to create a roughly five-square-block area \u2014 either around a collection of public housing projects or near a hospital \u2014 that could disconnect from the grid and operate independently in case of a power failure.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a recognition of energy needs beyond your own,\u201d Mr. Golden said. \u201cThere\u2019s a microgrid of our community, and that\u2019s great, but the hospitals, the clinics, the schools, large housing complexes \u2014 you can feed the energy where it needs to go.\u201d",

    "text": "At Risk in Rohingya Exodus: 230,000 Children, Hundreds All Alone\n2017-09-15T10:48:46.000Z\nHONG KONG \u2014 More than half of the Rohingya refugees who have fled Myanmar in the past three weeks are children, including hundreds who traveled without family members, putting them at particular risk in cramped, muddy camps in Bangladesh, aid workers say.\nThe United Nations says up to 400,000 Rohingya have fled the state of Rakhine in western Myanmar since Aug. 25 and are now struggling to find food, shelter and clean water in Bangladesh.\n\u201cThe camps are totally overcrowded,\u201d said Christophe Boulierac, a spokesman for Unicef. \u201cIt\u2019s very muddy and raining every day.\u201d\nOf those who have made it to Bangladesh since Aug. 25, about half arrived last week, Mr. Boulierac said, placing extreme pressure on the already struggling relief operations.\n\u201cVery frankly speaking, we are scaling up, but it is such an unprecedented influx,\u201d he said.\nAs of Friday, Unicef had counted 1,267 children at the camp who had been separated from their families. Amid the disorder of the rapidly expanding settlements in Bangladesh, the unaccompanied children are at particular risk for human trafficking, sexual abuse, child labor and child marriage, Mr. Boulierac said.\nUnicef has set up 41 spaces for children to relax and play, some of which can be moved around the camps. The sites also make it easier for aid workers to identify which children have traveled alone or have been separated from their families.\nThe needs of the children include food and nutritional support, basic health care and psychological counseling. More than 18,000 children have received help through the child-friendly spaces since Aug. 25. But with more than 230,000 children estimated to have arrived in Bangladesh, many more will need help, Mr. Boulierac said.\nThe United Nations Population Fund estimates that two-thirds of the refugees are women and girls, 13 percent of whom are pregnant or breast-feeding. It has sent dozens of midwives to help in the camps.\nAnd the numbers are likely to grow, Mr. Boulierac said. \u201cThe worrying news is we don\u2019t see any indication that this influx is decreasing.\u201d\nThe Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic group in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, have been pushed out of the country\u2019s west for decades. They have been deprived of citizenship rights and are often confined to villages with little freedom to travel and work.\nRohingya in Rakhine had already been living under a harsh security campaign that came after attacks by militants last October. An attack on Aug. 25 by a Rohingya militant group known as the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army on police posts and a military base in Rakhine touched off a renewed military crackdown that led to the mass exodus.\nThe military and Buddhist vigilantes have burned villages and massacred civilians, according to human rights groups and refugees. Bangladesh has also complained to Myanmar about reports of land mines placed along their shared border, which have injured and killed civilians in recent weeks.\nZeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, called the military campaign \u201ca textbook example of ethnic cleansing\u201d and a clear violation of international law. The Nobel Peace Prize laureates Malala Yousafzai of Pakistan and Bishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa have challenged Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto leader of Myanmar, to recognize the suffering of the Rohingya. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for leading a campaign against military rule.\nMs. Aung San Suu Kyi, who canceled plans to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York next week, has maintained the belief that the Rohingya are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. While the Rohingya trace their history in Myanmar for generations, the belief that they are foreigners is widely held there.\nMuhammad Yunus, the 2006 Peace Prize laureate, sent a letter with the signatures of 12 Nobel laureates and others calling for the United Nations Security Council to take immediate action to stop the military attacks on civilians. \u201cThe arguments that the Myanmar government is using to deny Rohingyas their citizenship are ludicrous,\u201d the letter said.\nDespite the international condemnation of Myanmar, efforts to punish its government have been limited.\nThis week, Senator John McCain of Arizona, who is also chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he would kill funding to expand cooperation between the militaries of the United States and Myanmar, \u201cgiven the worsening humanitarian crisis and human rights crackdown against the Rohingya people.\u201d\nJournalists and human rights investigators have been largely barred from Rakhine. A group of journalists was taken there on a government-supervised trip last week, and some reported seeing Buddhist men leaving a Rohingya village they had just set ablaze.\nThe lack of access has forced human rights groups to rely on satellite data and the testimony of people who have fled to document the extent of destruction. Amnesty International said Thursday that it had recorded 80 large-scale fires in Rakhine since Aug. 25, while the same period in the past four years had no blazes of such size on record.\nHuman Rights Watch said Friday that 62 villages in Rakhine had been targeted by arson since Aug. 25. \u201cOur field research backs what the satellite imagery has indicated \u2014 that the Burmese military is directly responsible for the mass burning of Rohingya villages in northern Rakhine State,\u201d said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch.",

    "text": "For One Rohingya Family, I Hoped for Redemption. That Hope Was Dashed.\n2017-12-22T10:00:37.000Z\nNAYAPARA REFUGEE CAMP, Bangladesh \u2014 A truck trying to overtake another car darted out from the wrong side of the road and slammed into the rickshaw. The tiny vehicle crumpled like a piece of tin foil, flipped twice and finally settled bottom upward. The truck that hit it sped away. For a moment, the six members of Nor Hossain\u2019s family, who had been riding inside, lay upside down in silence, covered in dirt, battery fluids and blood. It was their second day in Bangladesh.\nI had been in the car right behind them, and had been filming them since the moment they arrived from Myanmar for a video about the Rohingya refugee crisis. My translator and I jumped from our car and sprinted to their aid. I held a camera in one hand and pulled them out with the other. The next few days would become the worst of their lives.\nThe Rohingya refugee situation is a crisis of care. Nearly 650,000 refugees have crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh seeking solace from systematic attacks. Myanmar\u2019s government claims that the Rohingya are \u201cterrorists\u201d and that the attacks against them are \u201cfake news.\u201d But each night, under the cover of darkness, I watched thousands of them fleeing onto the shores of Bangladesh, each with stories of murder, rape and assault in what used to be their homeland.\nIn late September, I decided to find one family with a story that would be emblematic of these struggles.\nThat\u2019s how I met Ranjuma and her husband, Nor Hossain. Ranjuma was 25 years old and nine months pregnant. She wore a makeshift maternity girdle as she climbed out of the tiny wooden boat on the Naf River. Nor Hossain helped lift her out. He was 40 years old, with a long beard. They looked ragged but ecstatic. For days before taking to the water, they had been trekking through the woods. Ranjuma\u2019s ankles were swollen and thick. They had only two liters of water for the six of them (the couple\u2019s two small boys, as well as Ranjuma\u2019s brother and Nor Hossain\u2019s mother, were with them, too). Nor Hossain held Ranjuma\u2019s hand as they surveyed the new country.\nMy translator, Mohammed, explained our journalistic mission to them, and they agreed to be followed and filmed. They seemed excited to show the world their newfound hope.\nThe next day, the car accident happened. After pulling them out of the wreckage, we rushed with them to the closest Bangladeshi clinic. It was a basic, two-room building without power. Most of the family was shaken but only moderately injured. But for Yakub Ali, Ranjuma\u2019s 22-year-old brother, the injuries were more severe. He held his abdomen and writhed in pain. The doctors said his injuries were internal and could not be treated there. He was carried into an ambulance and referred to the main hospital in Cox\u2019s Bazar, nearly three hours away. He died of internal bleeding on the drive up.\nWhat I had hoped would be a story of redemption after fleeing from Myanmar had become the opposite.\nTwo days later, Ranjuma felt abdominal pains as well. Her pregnancy had been a challenge. Her stomach was so large, she had been expecting twins. She rushed to another small clinic. As soon as she lay down, her water broke and she went into labor. Doctors later explained she had been so large because she had developed a large water abscess that had been pressing down on her womb.\nWhen the baby was born, he was underweight. The water abscess had delayed his development and he was premature. After nearly 20 minutes of labored breathing, he was sent in an ambulance to the main clinic. Just like his uncle, he died on the way there.\nI\u2019ve covered wars and conflict around the world, but filming with this family was one of the hardest assignments of my career. I, like Nor Hossain and his family, had expected a story of redemption and hope in the face of oppression. Instead, it became a tale of failures. Their government back home in Myanmar had failed them, the infrastructure in Bangladesh had failed them, and the world around them, which continues to sit back, had failed them.\nNearly a month after those four painful days, I returned to the refugee camps to interview Ranjuma and Nor Hossain. They were happy to see me and glad their pain had been documented. I asked Nor Hossain if he regretted anything. Only one thing, he said.\n\u201cI wish I could have named my son,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least then we could have given him a voice.\u201d",

    "text": "Desperate Rohingya Flee Myanmar Crackdown in Growing Numbers, U.N. Says\n2017-09-05T11:27:45.000Z\nHONG KONG \u2014 At least 123,000 Rohingya have fled from western Myanmar into neighboring Bangladesh since late last month, the United Nations said on Tuesday, as a military crackdown has destroyed villages and killed hundreds.\nIn recent days, a constant stream of desperate people has marched through muddy fields while attempting to escape the violence. At least 46 Rohingya died last week when boats capsized while crossing a river between the two countries, the Bangladeshi authorities said.\nThe Rohingya are a largely Muslim ethnic group who mainly live in Rakhine State in western Myanmar, where they face severe restrictions on basic rights. On Aug. 25, Rohingya militants attacked several police outposts and a military base, killing at least 12 members of security forces.\nThe Myanmar military says it killed 370 Rohingya fighters in response to that attack. Soldiers and Buddhist vigilantes have carried out a campaign against people in Rakhine State, and those who have fled described seeing civilians shot from helicopters and homes burned to the ground.\nRohingya fleeing Myanmar have said that members of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, the militant group that claimed it carried out the attacks on Myanmar government forces, have tried to block men from fleeing villages and demanded they stay and fight against the government.\nWith villages still in flames in Rakhine State, the exodus that began last month is expected to continue, rights groups and United Nations officials said.\nThere are \u201cclear signs that more will cross into Bangladesh from Myanmar before situation stabilizes,\u201d Mohammed Abdiker, director of operations and emergencies for the United Nations migration agency, said on Twitter.\nThe \u201csuffering will continue\u201d without more international support, he added.\nMigrant Offshore Aid Station, a humanitarian group based in Malta that has focused on protecting migrants who travel over dangerous maritime routes, said this week that it was shifting operations from the Mediterranean Sea to Southeast Asia to help with the Rohingya crisis.\nRakhine State is home to about one million Rohingya, and in addition to those who have fled, thousands more face a growing risk of violence and food shortages, Amnesty International said. Last month the government of Myanmar accused aid agencies of colluding with Rohingya militants, a claim that Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, called unsupported and irresponsible.\nAid agencies say the government has continued to block their access to Rakhine State, increasing the risk to people of all ethnic groups fleeing the violence. \u201cBy blocking access for humanitarian organizations, Myanmar\u2019s authorities have put tens of thousands of people at risk and shown a callous disregard for human life,\u201d Tirana Hassan, Amnesty International\u2019s director for crisis response, said in a statement.\n\u201cRakhine State is on the precipice of a humanitarian disaster,\u201d she added.\nThe continuing violence has fanned criticism of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar\u2019s de facto leader and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate for her struggle against military rule. On Monday, she was confronted on Twitter by Malala Yousafzai, a fellow peace prize laureate, who asked Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi to speak out about the plight of the Rohingya. The governments of several predominantly Muslim countries, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan and Turkey, have also expressed concern.\nMs. Aung San Suu Kyi and her government have argued that the Rohingya are migrants from Bangladesh who do not deserve citizenship rights, although most have roots in the area that go back generations.",

    "text": "U.S. Threatens to Punish Myanmar Over Treatment of Rohingya\n2017-10-23T19:26:21.000Z\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration threatened on Monday to take punitive actions against Myanmar unless it pulls back from its violent military campaign against Rohingya Muslims, expressing what it called \u201cour gravest concern\u201d over a crisis that has killed or displaced hundreds of thousands of people.\nThe State Department said it has already cut off travel waivers allowing current and former senior military leaders into the country and was considering further actions to impose economic measures against those responsible for atrocities against Myanmar\u2019s ethnic minority. The department said that all military units involved in operations against the Rohingya were ineligible for American aid.\n\u201cThe government of Burma, including its armed forces, must take immediate action to ensure peace and security; implement commitments to ensure humanitarian access to communities in desperate need; facilitate the safe and voluntary return of those who have fled or been displaced in Rakhine State; and address the root causes of systematic discrimination against the Rohingya,\u201d the department said in a statement issued Monday night, using the former name for Myanmar.\nThe American warning came as the United Nations said the Rohingya Muslims who have fled deadly persecution in Myanmar to Bangladesh would soon exceed one million.\nThat prediction loomed over an emergency donors conference in Geneva to raise money for aid groups struggling to help Bangladesh, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, deal with the crisis.\nDoctors Without Borders, the medical charity, called the health conditions of the refugee encampments a \u201ctime bomb.\u201d\nMore than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have battled terror, exhaustion and hunger to reach safety in Bangladesh since Myanmar\u2019s army began a campaign of what the United Nations has called ethnic cleansing in late August. The new arrivals joined more than 300,000 Rohingya who had escaped in recent years.\nThe number of people crossing the Naf River that divides the two countries has slowed to about 1,000 to 3,000 a day, down from a peak of 12,000 to 18,000 a day earlier in the crisis, said William Lacy Swing, the director of the International Organization for Migration, a part of the United Nations.\nStill, he said, \u201ceven at that rate the numbers are expected to exceed a million shortly.\u201d\nMore than 300,000 children are among the Rohingya refugees. Mark Lowcock, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator, told reporters that many were acutely malnourished.\nStates had previously committed around $116 million toward the $430 million sought by the United Nations for humanitarian aid over the next six months. Pledges received from governments on Monday raised the total to about $340 million, Mr. Lowcock said, expressing confidence that additional contributions would flow in coming days.\nEven so, humanitarian agencies face enormous challenges delivering relief. Hundreds of thousands of refugees were crammed on a strip of land that lacked roads or infrastructure to support the delivery of aid.\nWith 210 hospital beds available to support more than 900,000 people living with little access to clean water, sanitation or medical care, the refugees\u2019 situation is a \u201ctime bomb ticking toward a full-blown health crisis,\u201d Joanne Liu, the international president of Doctors Without Borders told the meeting.\nThe United Nations food aid agency said that it had distributed food to 580,000 people since the crisis erupted, but that it had so far received less than one-third of the $77 million it needs to aid a million people over six months.\nQueen Rania of Jordan, who visited some of the camps on Monday, expressed shock at the conditions. \u201cIt is unforgivable that this crisis is unfolding, largely ignored by the international community,\u201d she said in a statement.",

    "text": "Walking the Line Between Reporting a Rohingya Refugee\u2019s Story and Changing It\n2017-09-17T16:30:05.000Z\nNoor slid to the ground. \u201cIt seems I will die here,\u201d he said, with an almost clinical detachment. \u201cI will die in this place.\u201d\nMinutes before, in the Balukhali refugee camp in Bangladesh, Noor had tapped my shoulder. It was an unusual sensation in a Muslim community where men and women keep to themselves.\nI turned around, and he showed me his bullet wound. Bruises mottled his body. Noor\u2019s story was consistent with many I had heard from refugees fleeing Myanmar, a mass exodus of at least 400,000 Rohingya that began toward the end of August and that the United Nations on Monday labeled a \u201ctextbook example of ethnic cleansing.\u201d\nThe 25-year-old farmer was in his fields in Maungdaw Township when the Myanmar military descended. The village men, and even some of the boys, were beaten, then told to run. Some made it, others didn\u2019t. Noor was lucky. A bullet only grazed his right shoulder. He could still walk after his beating.\nBut days of trekking through jungle on the way to Bangladesh had broken his body.\nRefugee camps are overflowing with Rohingya in need, hands outstretched for food or water or lifesaving medicine. You cannot help everyone, so you walk on, promising yourself that documenting their suffering is a form of aid.\nOn Aug. 29, the day before I traveled to Bangladesh, I stood in my new apartment in Bangkok \u2014 where I\u2019d just moved to begin work as The Times\u2019s Southeast Asia bureau chief \u2014 surrounded by boxes of possessions I did not need or even remember that my family owned: too many glasses for liqueurs I do not drink, mildewed paperbacks, Legos chewed by the dog.\nTwo days later, I stood in a creek near Bangladesh\u2019s border with Myanmar, as a never-ending column of barefoot humanity trudged through the water. Many people carried nothing but babies too traumatized to make any noise.\nOther Rohingya, who had only a few moments to prepare before the Myanmar military burned down their houses, balanced bamboo poles on their shoulders, heavy with sleeping mats, water jugs and solar panels.\nI thought about what I would take from home if I could only grab a few things: some antiques, perhaps, photos not on the Cloud, and all-important documents.\nMost Rohingya, however, have been rendered stateless by the Myanmar government, which seems to be using a Rohingya militant attack on police posts and an army base three weeks ago to justify a campaign to rid the country of this long-persecuted minority.\nTheir licenses, diplomas and other paperwork mean nothing to officialdom. Besides, you cannot eat documents. Live chickens and bags of rice are more sustaining.\nNoor, shivering and taking shallow breaths, was convinced he was dying. I\u2019m no doctor, but having covered conflict, I knew his condition was grave. We had a car and could take him to a clinic. Maybe reporters aren\u2019t supposed to change the story, but this was not one that I wanted to end with yet another Rohingya death.\nNoor refused to go. He had fled without his wife. One of the last things he heard from his village was the screams of women dragged away by soldiers and vigilantes. Noor had no idea if his wife had been raped or killed.\nThe morning of the day we met, he had finally heard that she was in another refugee settlement in Bangladesh. She might come by the next morning.\nSo Noor bought tarp and bamboo. He lashed them together. The effort drained the little energy he had left, but he wanted to make a home for his wife.\nHe could not bear the idea of going to the hospital without seeing her again.\nMy Bangladeshi colleague, AKM Moinuddin \u2014 who speaks a language very similar to Rohingya and helped with translations during the week I was there \u2014 pleaded with him. The photographer Adam Dean suggested that Noor would be more useful to his wife alive than dead.\nA crowd formed, as it invariably does in a refugee camp. Dozens of people concurred: Noor should not die here, slumped in a mud puddle. An imam showed up and exercised his authority.\nWe put Noor in our car and rushed to the clinic.\n\u201cMother, mother,\u201d he repeated, as his eyes rolled back in pain. \u201cMother, mother, help me.\u201d\nHalf an hour later, he disappeared into the clinic. I did not see him again.",

    "text": "An Insider\u2019s Guide to Halal Takeout\n2017-11-09T18:49:23.000Z\nRichly seasoned lamb curry, chana masala and saag paneer fill the chafing dishes. Cases display confections like gulab jamun and rasgulla, sweet milk and cheese dumplings. Overhead a television broadcasts images of Bollywood stars.\nThese features so define Pakistani and Bangladeshi restaurants in New York City that, at first glance, such places appear almost indistinguishable.\nBut make no mistake: Everyone has a favorite.\nFor goat pulao, Amanet Khan, a taxi driver of 25 years, goes to Lahori Chilli, on a stretch of Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn known as Little Pakistan. The dish is also a favorite at Chandni, a floor above the Ar-Rahman mosque in Manhattan. Go a few blocks east to Haandi in Curry Hill for lamb nihari, a stew of slow-cooked shanks and bone marrow.\nJackson Heights, Queens, a few drivers say, is where to get beef Bihari kebab, either at Dera or Kababish, where meat sits on a charcoal grill with spices boiling underneath.\nBy quirk of demographics, taxi drivers will be at any of these South Asian restaurants. According to New York City officials, about 62,000 people in the five boroughs identify as Bangladeshi, and about 51,000 as Pakistani. Of the 148,168 drivers licensed by the city\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission in 2015, 19,354 reported that they came from Bangladesh; 12,536 from Pakistan.\nMost takeout places are halal, which means that the food is prepared according to Islamic guidelines, as Pakistan and Bangladesh are Muslim-majority countries. And most are open 24/7 to accommodate drivers on different schedules.\nAt any hour, South-Asian Americans will be gathered, eating, drinking chai, talking of family, work and politics, with the names Uber, Trump and Sharif popping up in conversations in Urdu, Bengali and English. After all, with some recipes having survived immigration to America and the bloody partition of Pakistan and India 70 years ago, politics have a way of creeping into conversation.\nBut really, it\u2019s all about the food.\n\nHaandi, Manhattan, midnight\nIt was a summer Tuesday evening at Haandi, and 20-somethings drifted in for a midnight snack of pakora. A model from Karachi, eating chicken biryani, complained of dating A.B.C.D.s \u2014 American-born confused Desis. Drivers, their cabs and cars lining Lexington Avenue outside, rotated in and out on break.\nMr. Khan ate lamb karahi as he watched Geo News on the TV overhead. With disgust, he regarded the image of Nawaz Sharif, Pakistani\u2019s former tycoon prime minister, who was ousted in July.\nMr. Sharif had been under investigation after the so-called Panama Papers leaked last year, revealing that three of his children bought luxury apartments in London using offshore shell companies. Between forkfuls of lamb, Mr. Khan said, \u201cThey take money from our country, take it out of the country, live in another country, and as a people we are poor, poor, poor, poor.\u201d\nSeven days a week, Mr. Khan drives his cab, from 5 p.m. to around 2 a.m. He makes $4,000 to $4,500 a month depending on the season, which is really more like $1,400 to $1,900 after he\u2019s subtracted payments for his medallion lease and money sent to his ex-wife and three children in Lahore. This has been the arrangement for almost 15 years: them there, him here. (Though, happily, he reported a new marriage here.)\nDispatching about 64,000 cars every day, Uber and other ride-hailing apps have squeezed the taxi business (more than 17,000 yellow and green cabs are on the road today). But Mr. Khan, as an old-school yellow-cab driver, said he can keep up with the competition because he intimately knows the streets, compared to drivers who use ride hailing apps, who often depend heavily on GPS.\n\u201cIf I\u2019m going from downtown, uptown, then cross uptown, east to west,\u201d he said, \u201cI take First Avenue to uptown, then cross at 93rd Street, where there\u2019s less traffic, and the light is open, one by one by one by one.\u201d\n\nLahori Chilli, Brooklyn, 3 p.m.\nThe week before, on a bright Friday afternoon, double-parked black cars clogged Coney Island Avenue during prayer at Makki Masjid. After services, men streamed out of the mosque. Many of the younger ones did not linger, filing straight to their Uber-stamped black cars \u2014 they had children to pick up, undergrad I.T. classes to get to, likely customers in Park Slope.\nThe older ones, some in traditional shalwar kameez and kufi caps, took their time as they walked toward restaurants lining the avenue for a late lunch.\nInside Lahori Chilli sat Shakeel Baig, 40, a driver for Uber and Juno who lives in Jamaica, Queens, while he supports his wife and five children in Lahore. Eating chickpeas and yogurt, he complained that in three years, Uber has cut its fares twice \u2014 by about 20 percent in 2014, then 15 percent in 2016.\n\u201cIt completely affects everything,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore I would put 60 hours, you know. I was very happy. Now I put 80 hours.\u201d\n\nDera and Kababish, Queens, 8 p.m.\nThe three-quarters of the tables at Dera were full on a recent rainy Friday night, with families coaxing their children to eat more beef nihari, another forkful of chicken biryani.\nFaisal Muhammad, 32, an auditor who lives in Manhattan, and Nasra Jahir, an Indian flight attendant, were there on a first date. They met through Shaadi.com, an Indian matchmaking website where profiles are often perused by singles and their parents alike.\nAsked what caught his eye about Ms. Jahir, Mr. Muhammad said: \u201cI thought she was beautiful. And she is.\u201d\nMohammad Saif Ullah, 50, who also owns another Dera in Curry Hill (Lexington Avenue between 27th and 28th Streets), bought this one in 2004. He arrived in New York seeking political asylum from Pakistan in 1991, after a conservative Muslim party won power. His sapphire ring and rose-gold watch are remnants of his profession during his early years in New York \u2014 a jeweler. He didn\u2019t cook then, or now, but that didn\u2019t make him doubt his ability to run restaurants. \u201cI know the taste,\u201d he said.\nAcross the street, mostly men entered and left the tiny takeout spot Kababish.

    "text": "Dozens Found Guilty in Thailand in Human-Trafficking Case\n2017-07-19T12:07:47.000Z\nBANGKOK \u2014 A court in Thailand convicted dozens on Wednesday of organizing a human-trafficking ring that enslaved hundreds of people. Many victims were found buried in a mass grave near a secret jungle camp in which they had been imprisoned, tortured and held for ransom.\nThe defendants included a high-ranking officer, Lt. Gen. Manas Kongpan, and Pajjuban Aungkachotephan, a businessman and former politician, as well as police officers and smugglers from Bangladesh, Myanmar and Thailand.\nGeneral Manas was convicted of trafficking and of committing an organized transnational crime, and he was sentenced to 27 years in prison; Mr. Pajjuban received a 75-year sentence.\nThe defendants were arrested in 2015 after 36 bodies were found in shallow graves near the border with Malaysia. The discovery led to efforts to dismantle a multimillion-dollar smuggling enterprise, and the traffickers soon abandoned their human chattel in jungle camps or in crowded vessels adrift in the Andaman Sea.\nInvestigators said the victims were from Bangladesh or Myanmar \u2014 many of them Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority \u2014 and had paid smugglers to help them find work in Thailand. Instead, they became slaves in Thailand\u2019s lucrative fishing fleet, the authorities said.\nJudges at the Criminal Court in Bangkok held a lengthy session on Wednesday to announce the verdicts, and many relatives of the defendants were crying as the verdicts were read. In doing so, the judges quoted the testimony of witnesses who had described harrowing journeys of deprivation.\nVictims said they had been smuggled from Bangladesh and Myanmar in cramped boats with little food and water. In Thailand, they were packed into trucks and marched to camps in the forested mountains of Songkhla Province. There, they were imprisoned and made to call their families and beg for ransoms of around $3,000. Some said they had been raped.\nWhen discovering the camp in 2015, the Thai police described finding bamboo cages, watchtowers and a \u201ctorture room.\u201d\nUnder pressure from the United States and Europe, the junta that came to power in a coup in 2014 made a display of prosecuting members of the ring, including General Manas.\nThe chief of the junta, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, said the military should not be blamed for the actions of one officer. \u201cThere are many people in this human-trafficking network,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cDon\u2019t group all soldiers in the country as one.\u201d\nWitnesses, prosecutors and investigators were hounded throughout the trial. In 2015, the police officer who had first overseen the investigation and who had issued more than 150 warrants fled to Australia after numerous threats to his life.\nUltimately, 103 people pleaded not guilty to a bevy of charges that included human trafficking. One defendant died while in custody.\nThe court said it had found some defendants not guilty because of \u201cunclear or insufficient evidence.\u201d\n\u201cThis may be the end of an important and unprecedented trial, but it\u2019s been a rocky road,\u201d Amy A. Smith, executive director of Fortify Rights, a Southeast Asia rights watchdog, said in a statement, adding, \u201cThailand has a long way to go to ensure justice for thousands who were exploited, tortured and killed by human traffickers.\u201d",

    "text": "Aung San Suu Kyi Makes First Visit to Rohingya Area in Myanmar\n2017-11-02T10:57:07.000Z\nBANGKOK \u2014 For the first time since Myanmar\u2019s military unleashed violence against Rohingya Muslims in August, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate who heads the civilian government, on Thursday visited the state where the atrocities have been taking place.\nThe United Nations and international rights groups have laid out evidence of an ethnic cleansing campaign across the northern part of the state, Rakhine. They say that hundreds, at least, have been killed, and that the majority of the Rohingya population has been driven into neighboring Bangladesh by the military\u2019s use of arson, execution and rape.\nThe Myanmar government, however, says it is fighting Rohingya Muslim \u201cterrorists\u201d who launched attacks on security outposts, killing at least a dozen people. Members of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s cabinet maintain that not a single Rohingya has been killed by the Myanmar military.\nThere is little overlap between the international and domestic narratives.\nOne of the places Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi visited during her day trip to northern Rakhine was Taung Pyo, on the border with Bangladesh. The rice-growing hamlet serves as a case study in how perceptions of the violence in Rakhine have diverged.\nIn September, Setara Begum, a 28-year-old mother of four boys and one girl, waded across a stream separating a no man\u2019s land from Bangladesh. Wringing the water out of her dress and setting a child in the mud on the riverbank, she told me she had been forced to flee her home in Taung Pyo after the security forces surrounded the village in late August, ordering them to \u201crun, run, run.\u201d\nShe did, an infant in one hand, a toddler gripping the other. Miraculously, all of her children made it to Bangladesh. But her husband, who had been tilling the fields when the soldiers came, was missing. As she ran, she saw a child facedown in a rice paddy. The last Ms. Setara saw of her village was an orange glow burning from the area where her house had been.\n\u201cIf the color of the fire was in a dress it would be beautiful,\u201d she said, looking down at her muddy clothes, \u201cbut it made me very fearful when I saw it.\u201d\nA Human Rights Watch investigation documented that parts of Taung Pyo were still burning in mid-September as Myanmar soldiers patrolled the village, despite the fact that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said that all \u201cclearance operations\u201d against militants had ceased on Sept. 5.\nWhile Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize as a political prisoner in 1991, controls the country\u2019s civilian government, she has no authority over Myanmar\u2019s military.\nRefugees from Taung Pyo, known in the Rohingya dialect as Tumbru, said that there were almost no Rohingya left in the community \u2014 they had either bolted to Bangladesh, been killed by gunfire or been arrested. Another villager, Mohamed Aktar, said he counted at least three bodies as he fled the area in late August.\n\u201cMaybe more,\u201d he said. \u201cI ran so fast I could not count well.\u201d\nBangladesh has accused Myanmar\u2019s military of laying land mines in the area. One woman who tried to cross back to Taung Pyo, in order to investigate the damage to her home, stepped on a mine and lost most of her leg. She was treated in a hospital in Bangladesh.\nThe Myanmar military said that any land mines found in the area were the work of Rohingya insurgents. The state news media, meanwhile, have focused on the plight of ethnic Rakhine who had fled their homes and took refuge in a police post near Taung Pyo.\nThe vast majority of residents in northern Maungdaw township, which includes Taung Pyo, are Rohingya Muslims. But the civil servants there \u2014 teachers, nurses, administrators \u2014 tend to be ethnic Rakhine Buddhists.\nStories in the local news media focused on how rice, beans and cooking oil had been delivered to Rakhine Buddhists sheltering in Taung Pyo. The stranded community was eventually airlifted to safety.\nBy contrast, for weeks, international aid groups were unable to deliver aid to Rohingya isolated in Maungdaw, Buthidaung and Rathedaung townships, the three worst-affected areas. Some Rohingya said by cellphone earlier this week that they still had not gotten adequate food supplies.\nThe local news media published photographs of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi on Thursday meeting Rohingya in another village in Maungdaw. Before her sat rows of men wearing pristine white prayer caps.\nMs. Aung San Suu Kyi has repeatedly said that the international community should try to understand why some Rohingya have decided to stay in Rakhine, rather than flee to Bangladesh.\n\u201cI hope everything will go fine as local villagers handle the rebuilding process,\u201d Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi told the residents of Pan Taw Pyin village. \u201cWe all have to try our best to live peacefully.\u201d\nBut critics say that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, in the most charitable interpretation of her actions, has allowed herself to be blinded to the realities of ethnic cleansing in Rakhine.\n\u201cJust as important as finally visiting affected areas is the need for Aung San Suu Kyi to actually understand what happened there. And that requires her to break the military cordon around the information she\u2019s receiving and start listening to other sources,\u201d said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch.\n\u201cSome scales need to fall from her eyes about northern Rakhine State, and one hopes that this could be the beginning of that process,\u201d he said.\nSo far, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s governing party, the National League for Democracy, has not sent any investigators to the refugee camps in Bangladesh to hear the stories of the more than 600,000 Rohingya who have fled.\nThe Myanmar government has said it is willing to repatriate those Rohingya who have flocked to Bangladesh over the past two months, if they can prove they used to live in Rakhine.\nBut many Rohingya escaped their burning villages without any documents, so it is not clear how they will be able to prove their former residency. Most Rohingya have been stripped of their citizenship by the Myanmar government, making them stateless.\nOn Tuesday, U Zaw Htay, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s spokesman, reiterated that Myanmar was ready to start repatriation immediately, but then accused Bangladesh of dragging its feet in order to wheedle money out of a sympathetic international community.\n\u201cI think the reason Bangladesh doesn\u2019t want to send refugees back to Myanmar might be because they announced that they would build the world\u2019s biggest refugee camp,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why they don\u2019t want to send refugees back to Myanmar, because they are afraid they will lose international donations.\u201d",

    "text": "Rohingya Recount Atrocities: \u2018They Threw My Baby Into a Fire\u2019\n2017-10-11T15:30:33.000Z\nCOX\u2019S BAZAR, Bangladesh \u2014 Hundreds of women stood in the river, held at gunpoint, ordered not to move.\nA pack of soldiers stepped toward a petite young woman with light brown eyes and delicate cheekbones. Her name was Rajuma, and she was standing chest-high in the water, clutching her baby son, while her village in Myanmar burned down behind her.\n\u201cYou,\u201d the soldiers said, pointing at her.\nShe froze.\n\u201cYou!\u201d\nShe squeezed her baby tighter.\nIn the next violent blur of moments, the soldiers clubbed Rajuma in the face, tore her screaming child out of her arms and hurled him into a fire. She was then dragged into a house and gang-raped.\nBy the time the day was over, she was running through a field naked and covered in blood. Alone, she had lost her son, her mother, her two sisters and her younger brother, all wiped out in front of her eyes, she says.\nRajuma is a Rohingya Muslim, one of the most persecuted ethnic groups on earth, and she now spends her days drifting through a refugee camp in Bangladesh in a daze.\nShe relayed her story to me during a recent reporting trip I made to the camps, where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya like her have rushed for safety. Her deeply disturbing account of what happened in her village, in late August, was corroborated by dozens of other survivors, whom I spoke with at length, and by human rights groups gathering evidence of atrocities.\nSurvivors said they saw government soldiers stabbing babies, cutting off boys\u2019 heads, gang-raping girls, shooting 40-millimeter grenades into houses, burning entire families to death, and rounding up dozens of unarmed male villagers and summarily executing them.\nMuch of the violence was flamboyantly brutal, intimate and personal \u2014 the kind that is detonated by a long, bitter history of ethnic hatred.\n\u201cPeople were holding the soldiers\u2019 feet, begging for their lives,\u201d Rajuma said. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t stop, they just kicked them off and killed them. They chopped people, they shot people, they raped us, they left us senseless.\u201d\nHuman rights investigators said that Myanmar\u2019s military killed more than 1,000 civilians in the state of Rakhine, and possibly as many as 5,000, though it will be hard to ever know because Myanmar is not allowing the United Nations or anyone else into the affected areas.\nPeter Bouckaert, a veteran investigator with Human Rights Watch, said there was growing evidence of organized massacres, like the one Rajuma survived, in which government soldiers methodically slaughtered more than 100 civilians in a single location. He called them crimes against humanity.\nOn Wednesday, the United Nations human rights office said that government troops had targeted \u201chouses, fields, food-stocks, crops, livestock and even trees,\u201d making it \u201calmost impossible\u201d for the Rohingya to return home.\nMyanmar\u2019s army has claimed it was responding to an attack by Rohingya militants on Aug. 25 and targeting only the insurgents. But according to dozens of witnesses, almost all of the people killed were unarmed villagers, and many had their hands bound.\nSatellite imagery has revealed 288 separate villages burned, some down to the last post.\nHuman rights groups said the government troops had one goal: to erase entire Rohingya communities. The unsparing destruction drove more than half a million people into Bangladesh in recent weeks. United Nations officials called the campaign against the Rohingya a \u201ctextbook example\u201d of ethnic cleansing.\nSatellite images show that at least 200 villages of Myanmar\u2019s Rohingya ethnic minority have been set ablaze since late August.\nNearly each night here in coastal Bangladesh, up the Bay of Bengal from Myanmar, bodies wash up in the foamy brown tide \u2014 children, men, old women who tried to escape on leaking boats, their faces bloated from seawater.\nRajuma barely made it to Bangladesh, escaping on a small wooden boat a few weeks ago. She cannot read or write. She does not have a single piece of paper to prove who she is or that she was born in Myanmar. This may be a problem if she applies for refugee status in Bangladesh, which has been reluctant to give it, or ever tries to go home to Myanmar. She thinks she is around 20, but she could pass for 14 \u2014 painfully thin, with wrists that look as if they could easily break.\nShe grew up in a rice farming hamlet called Tula Toli, and said the place had never known peace.\nThe two main ethnic groups in her village, the Buddhist Rakhines and the Muslim Rohingya, were like two planes drawn to never touch. They followed different religions, spoke different languages, ate different foods and have always distrusted each other.\nA community of Buddhists lived just a few minutes from Rajuma\u2019s house, but she had never spoken with any of them.\n\u201cThey hate us,\u201d she said.\nAzeem Ibrahim, a Scottish academic who recently wrote a book on the Rohingya, explained that much of the animosity could be traced to World War II, when the Rohingya fought on the British side and many Buddhists in Rakhine fought for the occupying Japanese. Both sides massacred civilians.\nAfter the Allies won, the Rohingya hoped to win independence or join East Pakistan (today\u2019s Bangladesh), which was also majority Muslim and ethnically similar to the Rohingya. But the British, eager to appease Myanmar\u2019s Buddhist majority, decreed that the Rohingya areas would become part of newly independent Myanmar (then called Burma), setting the Rohingya up for decades of discrimination.\nMyanmar\u2019s leaders soon began stripping their rights and blaming them for the country\u2019s shortcomings, claiming the Rohingya were illegal migrants from Bangladesh who had stolen good land.\n\u201cYear after year, they were demonized,\u201d Mr. Ibrahim said.\nSome influential Buddhist monks said the Rohingya were the reincarnation of snakes and insects and should be exterminated, like vermin.\nThe persecution fueled a new Rohingya militant movement, which staged attacks against Myanmar security outposts on Aug. 25.\nFrom her village, Rajuma said, she heard explosions from one of those attacks \u2014 or at least from the government response to it.\nOver the next few days, Rajuma watched huge fires burn on the horizon. The military was beginning what it called \u201cclearance operations.\u201d Rohingya villages all around Tula Toli were burned to the ground, and on the night of Aug. 29, an elder came from the mosque to Rajuma\u2019s house to deliver a message: The Buddhists say we should go to the river, for our safety.\nHer family decided to stay put. \u201cNobody trusts a Buddhist,\u201d Rajuma said.\nThe next morning, Rajuma was busy making potato curry. As she sprinkled ginger and chiles into a big pot, she sensed something and stopped.\nShe crept to the window and peeked out: soldiers, dozens of them, jogging toward Tula Toli.\nRajuma and her family tried to run but were quickly captured and marched to a riverbank where hundreds of other terrified villagers had been taken prisoner.\nThe soldiers separated the men from the women. The villagers pleaded for their lives and dropped to their knees, hugging the soldiers\u2019 boots. The soldiers kicked them off and methodically killed all the men, said Rajuma and several other survivors from Tula Toli, all interviewed separately.\nThe women and young children were sent into the water and told to wait.\nIn terms of the tactics used, the weapons fired, the openness of the killings, the gang rapes and the level of military organization, the accounts from many different Rohingya areas present a distressing harmony.\n\u201cStories of atrocities are universal,\u201d said Anthony Lake, the executive director of Unicef.\nHe said he was profoundly troubled by what Rohingya children had been drawing in the camps \u2014 guns, fires, machetes and people on the ground with red streaming out of them.\nIn a hospital bed near Cox\u2019s Bazar, the biggest town in this part of Bangladesh, Muhamedul Hassan, a Rohingya shopkeeper from a village called Monu Para, lies on a clean white sheet. Doctors say the fact he is still alive is a miracle.\nOn Aug. 27, Mr. Hassan said, around 20 soldiers from a nearby army base stormed into Monu Para and ordered all the men and any boys older than 10 to report to the house of a prominent Rohingya cattle trader.\nThe soldiers tied everyone\u2019s hands behind their backs. They made them sit in the yard, heads down.\nAround 400 men and boys were hunched over, Mr. Hassan said. They were sweating through their shirts. An army sergeant whom the villagers knew then pulled out a long, thin knife.\n\u201cPeople were calling for help,\u201d Mr. Hassan said. \u201cThe boys were screaming out their mother\u2019s name, their father\u2019s name.\u201d\nMr. Hassan said that in front of his eyes, dozens of people were decapitated or shot. He was shot three times \u2014 twice in the back and once in the chest \u2014 but all the bullets missed vital organs.\nAfter the soldiers left, Mr. Hassan said, he stumbled away to his house, where his sister stuffed turmeric powder, the best they could do for an antiseptic, into his wounds.\nHuman rights investigators said the gravest atrocities they have documented were committed from Aug. 25 to Sept. 1, the period right after the militant attacks. Many witnesses described government troops wantonly killing anyone they could get their hands on.\nIn Tula Toli, Rajuma fought as hard as she could to hold onto her baby, Muhammad Sadeque, about 18 months old.\nBut one soldier grabbed her hands, another grabbed her body, and another slugged her in the face with a club. A jagged scar now runs along her jaw.\nThe child was lifted away from her, his legs wiggling in the air.\n\u201cThey threw my baby into a fire \u2014 they just flung him,\u201d she said.\nRajuma said two soldiers then pulled her into a house, tore off her veil and dress and raped her. She said that her two sisters were raped and killed in the same room, and that in the next room, her mother and 10-year-old brother were shot.\nAt some point, Rajuma thought she had died. She lost consciousness. When she woke, the soldiers were gone, but the house was on fire.\nShe sprinted out naked, past her family\u2019s bodies, past burning homes, and hid in a forest. Night fell, but she did not sleep.\nIn the morning she found an old T-shirt to wear and kept running.\nMany people in the refugee camps have been eerily stoic \u2014 seemingly traumatized past the ability to feel. In dozens of interviews with survivors who said their loved ones had been killed in front of them, not a single tear was shed.\nBut as she reached the end of her horrible testimony, Rajuma broke down.\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain how hard it hurts,\u201d she said, tears rolling off her cheeks, \u201cto no longer hear my son call me ma.\u201d\nShe hunched over on a plastic stool in another family\u2019s hut, covered her mouth with a red veil and started sobbing so hard she could barely breathe.\nA few other refugees looked over at her but went on cooking or cleaning. Outside, on a road not far away, trucks blared their horns, fighting through traffic.",

After two days of blaming \u201cmany sides\u201d for the \u201chatred, bigotry and violence\u201d on display in Charlottesville, President Trump on Aug. 14 bowed to overwhelming pressure that he personally condemn white supremacists, including neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan.

The two attacks killed at least 14 people and injured more than 100.\n24. _________, the embattled chief strategist who helped President Trump win the 2016 election by embracing their shared nationalist impulses, departed the White House on Aug. 18 after a turbulent tenure shaping the fiery populism of the president\u2019s first seven months in office.\n25. A _________ crossed the sky on Aug. 21 from Oregon to South Carolina and brought out throngs of spectators, who exulted in seeing the midday sky go briefly dark. This was totality, an event that had not happened in the continental United States since 1979 and had not traversed such a broad swath of the country in nearly a century.\n26. _________, one of the most destructive storms in the nation\u2019s history, pummeled southeast Texas after making landfall on Aug. 25. Catastrophic flooding that turned neighborhoods into lakes was just the start of a disaster that will take years to overcome.\n27. President Trump on Sept. 5 ordered an end to the Obama-era program that shields _________ from deportation, calling it an \u201camnesty-first approach\u201d and urging Congress to pass a replacement before he begins phasing out its protections in six months.\n28. Since late August, more than 620,000 _________, about two-thirds of the population that lived in Myanmar in 2016, have fled to Bangladesh, driven out by the military\u2019s systematic campaign of massacre, rape and arson in Rakhine.\n29. President Trump brought the same confrontational style of leadership he has used at home to the world\u2019s most prominent stage on Sept. 19 as he vowed to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea if it threatened the United States and denounced the nuclear agreement with Iran as \u201can embarrassment\u201d that he may abandon. In his first address to the _________, Mr. Trump framed the conflicts as a test of the international system.\n30. Following Mr. Trump\u2019s U.N. speech when he referred to North Korea as a \u201cband of criminals,\u201d and said of its leader, \u201cRocket man is on a suicide mission for himself,\u201d _________ called Mr. Trump a \u201cmentally deranged U.S. dotard\u201d who had \u201cdenied the existence of and insulted me and my country in front of the eyes of the world.\u201d\n31. Hurricane Maria, the most powerful storm to make a direct hit on _________ in almost a century, ravaged the island on Sept. 20, knocking out all electricity, deluging towns with flash floods and mudslides and compounding the already considerable pain of residents there.

Dozens of _________, from London to Los Angeles, knelt or locked arms on the sidelines, joined by several team owners; on some teams, nearly all the players skipped the national anthem altogether. What had been a modest round of anthem demonstrations this season led by a handful of African-American players mushroomed and morphed in late September into a nationwide, diverse rebuke of Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive statements.\n35. Jubilant Iraqi _________ celebrated their Sept. 25 vote on independence from Iraq, shooting off fireworks late into the night. But after weeks of threats and posturing, the Iraqi government began a military assault on Oct. 16 to blunt the independence drive, wresting oil fields and a contested city from separatists pushing to break away from the country.\n36. A gunman on a high floor of a _________ hotel rained a rapid-fire barrage on an outdoor concert festival on the night of Oct. 1, killing 58 people, injuring hundreds of others and sending thousands of terrified survivors fleeing for cover, in one of the deadliest mass shootings in American history.\n37.

In early October, _________, the Hollywood producer, was fired from his namesake company after multiple women came forward to accuse him of rape and sexual assault.

After deadly street protests this summer and a continuing consolidation of power by President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, _________ is on the verge of, and by some measures already in, an extraordinary period of hyperinflation, with the inflation rate above 800 percent through October.

Militants detonated a bomb inside a crowded mosque in the Sinai Peninsula on Nov. 24 and then sprayed gunfire on panicked worshipers as they fled, killing at least 305 people and wounding at least 128 others. Officials called it the deadliest terrorist attack in _________\u2019s modern history.\n47. _________ fired an intercontinental ballistic missile on Nov. 28 that flew both higher and longer than previous such launches, a bold act of defiance against President Trump after he put the country back on a list of state sponsors of terrorism.\n48.

In an emotional speech on the Senate floor, _________, Democrat of Minnesota, announced on Dec. 7 that he would resign from Congress, the most prominent figure in a growing list of lawmakers felled by charges of sexual harassment or indiscretions.

    "text": "Hands Tied by Old Hope, Diplomats in Myanmar Stay Silent\n2017-10-12T19:54:25.000Z\nYANGON, Myanmar \u2014 It is unfolding again: Troops have unleashed fire and rape and indiscriminate slaughter on a vulnerable minority, driving hundreds of thousands of civilians to flee and creating a humanitarian emergency that crosses borders.\nA crisis in Myanmar that many saw coming has brought a host of uncomfortable questions along with it: Why did the world \u2014 which promised \u201cnever again\u201d after Rwanda and Bosnia, then Sudan and Syria \u2014 seemingly do so little to forestall an ethnic cleansing campaign by Myanmar\u2019s military? And what can be done now to address the urgent humanitarian calamity caused when more than half of Myanmar\u2019s ethnic Rohingya Muslims fled the country over just a few weeks?\nOutside Myanmar, criticism of its military has mounted. The United Nations secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has urged \u201cunfettered access\u201d for international agencies and called the Rohingya crisis \u201cthe world\u2019s fastest-developing refugee emergency and a humanitarian and human rights nightmare.\u201d\nPresident Emmanuel Macron of France has called it genocide. And there is talk, although still tentative, of the European Union\u2019s renewing targeted sanctions on people culpable in the violence that has driven the Rohingya from Rakhine, a state in western Myanmar.\nBut in Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s commercial capital, where the diplomatic corps is based, there is still reluctance to call to task publicly either the military or the civilian administration led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Some diplomats say they are trying to preserve whatever influence they may have left, in order to avert an even worse catastrophe.\nMore than half a million Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh since late August, when a Rohingya militant attack on Myanmar security posts catalyzed a brutal counteroffensive. Hundreds of thousands more remaining in Myanmar may still be trying to cross the border. Those who cannot flee are trapped and hungry in northern Rakhine, according to anecdotal evidence collected by international aid agencies, which the government has largely prevented from delivering relief supplies or even assessing need in the region.\n\u201cThere are few places on Earth where we are denied access to this extent,\u201d said Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council. \u201cWe have an office in northern Rakhine, we have staff there, we have supplies there, we could go tomorrow with our trucks \u2014 but we are being stopped. This is illegal, this is intolerable.\u201d\nI spoke to half a dozen ambassadors and senior aid agency staff members in Yangon about what the problem was. All asked to speak off the record.\nThere are many reasons for their reticence, but a major one is this: Myanmar has been presented as a success story, despite a host of economic and ethnic problems.\nElections in 2015 elevated Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate whose name was once a byword for acts of conscience, and seemed to usher in a chance for democracy to take hold.\nBut whatever authority she has, as the nation\u2019s state counselor, is dwarfed by that of a military that ruled for nearly half a century and continues to monopolize power.\nMs. Aung San Suu Kyi is not the one ordering Rohingya villages to be burned down or civilians to be massacred. That firepower lies with the Tatmadaw, Myanmar\u2019s military, led by Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing.\nIn a Facebook post on Thursday recounting his meeting with the United States ambassador, Scot Marciel, the military chief called reports of a large exodus of Rohingya to Bangladesh an \u201cexaggeration.\u201d He reiterated that Rohingya were \u201cnot the natives\u201d of Myanmar.\nDiplomats say Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi used to express sympathy for the Rohingya in private, explaining that she could not speak out because of widespread hatred for them among the Buddhist majority. But over the past year or so, she has begun implying that the Rohingya are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.\nIn a televised address on Thursday, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi pushed back against international criticism and promised to personally oversee efforts to bring peace to Rakhine and repatriate those who have fled to Bangladesh.\nIn the speech, as in an address delivered to foreign envoys last month, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi declined to tackle accusations that the military has unleashed arson, murder and rape on the Rohingya.\nDespite Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s obfuscations, diplomats in Yangon have tended to avoid increasing public pressure. Veteran observers of Myanmar\u2019s military, which has long faced condemnation for its brutality toward civilians and ethnic minorities, have warned that an international shaming of a disgraced Nobel laureate is just what the generals want.\n\u201cShe gets all the criticism, and then the Tatmadaw gets to quietly do what it wants and what it has done for decades, which is to burn villages and terrorize ethnic areas,\u201d said David Scott Mathieson, a longtime human-rights researcher in Myanmar.\nForeign envoys here are mindful of the complex politics. A nation does not emerge from 50 years of military dictatorship without political wounds, they say, asserting that pushing Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, whose famous resolve can tend toward obduracy, could be counterproductive.\nOne senior Western envoy said that with no real coordination between military and civilian officials, weeks of flying back and forth to talk with them had come to nothing. The diplomat called it \u201cby far the most frustrating issue I\u2019ve ever worked on.\u201d\nMr. Egeland, who once served as the United Nations\u2019 under secretary general for humanitarian affairs, has grown impatient.\n\u201cI would like to issue a terse message to the diplomats,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to disagree that it is a complicated situation. It is very simple: When humanitarians are not allowed to help civilians, people die.\u201d\nFor its part, the United Nations in Myanmar commissioned an internal report, submitted in April, that warned against soft-pedaling on human rights to placate the military or the civilian authority.\n\u201cTrade-offs between advocacy and access,\u201d the report said, \u201chave in practice deprioritized human rights and humanitarian action, which are seen as complicating and undermining relations with government.\u201d\nThe report\u2019s author, Richard Horsey, noted how quickly the honeymoon period after the 2015 elections had subsided.\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be surprised that the landing spot for Myanmar\u2019s transition may be as one more Southeast Asian nation with authoritarian tendencies, rising nationalism and ethnic tensions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Myanmar should aspire to be so much better than that.\u201d\nCertainly, few countries enjoyed as much international good will as Myanmar did, at a time when the world was desperate for a positive narrative.\n\u201cWestern donors and the U.N. have not always been helpful,\u201d said Charles Petrie, a former United Nations resident coordinator in Myanmar, noting \u201cthe refusal for a long time to let go of the fairy-tale view of Myanmar with Aung San Suu Kyi coming to power and the corresponding refusal to push back on some of her dogmatic positions.\u201d\nMr. Petrie drew comparisons with South Sudan, where the world was \u201cso taken by the narrative of a new country emerging from northern enslavement that the signs of the emerging violence were ignored.\u201d\nInternational aid workers with years of experience in Rakhine say they have never seen the situation so grave.\nBrad Hazlett of Partners Relief and Development, a Christian charity that has provided food aid to the Rohingya, said he had been prevented from visiting internment camps this month in the state capital, Sittwe, that he had visited dozens of times before.\n\u201cI think their strategy is to starve them out,\u201d he said.\nAbul Hashim, a Rohingya from the northern Rakhine village of Anauk Pyin, described by cellphone how a team of ambassadors and United Nations officials had gone to the community on Oct. 2 as part of a stage-managed government trip. The crowds of officials who had helicoptered in promised food aid to the village.\nBut for nearly 10 days, Mr. Hashim said, his community had received nothing. For three months, none of the Rohingya have been allowed to step outside the village, he said. They have had no access to doctors or schools. Until some aid arrived on Wednesday evening, all he, his wife, their three daughters and three sons had eaten that day was less than a pound of rice and some water.\n\u201cOur sorrows,\u201d he said, \u201cknow no bounds.\u201d",

    "text": "Food From Around the World, Homegrown in New York\n2017-07-30T14:00:18.000Z\nEfrain Estrada grows so many peppers, eggplants, okra and squash that he sends the extras to his relatives in Puerto Rico.\nThough Mr. Estrada calls himself a farmer, his bounty sprouts from the unlikeliest of settings: a patch of green wedged among the bodegas and public housing projects of the South Bronx. There, in a community garden where Mr. Estrada is one of dozens of urban farmers, he fills a box of soil no larger than a child\u2019s sandbox with the things he used to grow with his father on a farm in Puerto Rico.\n\u201cIf I knew what I know now, I would have helped my father a lot more,\u201d said Mr. Estrada, 74, a retired cook. \u201cThere would have been more food.\u201d\nMr. Estrada is able to carry on his family\u2019s agrarian tradition in a teeming metropolis as a result of New York City\u2019s thriving network of community gardens, which is being expanded at a time when an onslaught of development has made these public green spaces more valuable than ever. The community gardens are a refuge for immigrants and those without farms or country houses to escape to in the summer as well as a homegrown source of fruits and vegetables in food deserts like the South Bronx.\nThis summer, the Parks Department\u2019s GreenThumb program \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest community garden program \u2014 has grown to 553 gardens, up from 501 in 2009. Most of the gardens sit on city-owned or other public property, and are maintained by community groups and a dedicated corps of 20,000 volunteer gardeners.\nIn many neighborhoods, community gardens have fiercely loyal protectors who have mobilized in recent years as the city has targeted gardens in Harlem and elsewhere as sites for affordable housing, and private developers have also eyed them.\nBill LoSasso, the director of GreenThumb, said the program had increased its efforts to create more community gardens across the city, especially in largely immigrant communities where many newcomers have roots in agricultural areas. Its budget has increased to $2.9 million annually from $720,000 three years ago, and its staff has nearly doubled to 35 people, who provide training and support and free materials like plants, shovels and wheelbarrows.\n\u201cSometimes when you arrive in a new place, you don\u2019t have a network you can tap into for support,\u201d Mr. LoSasso said. \u201cBy joining a community garden, you\u2019re joining a network of neighbors who are coming from diverse backgrounds who can help new members of their community to get settled.\u201d\nAbout 3.2 million New Yorkers, or 38 percent of the city\u2019s population of 8.5 million, were born in other countries, according to an analysis of census data by Queens College. About half of those immigrants came from the Caribbean, Central America and South America.\nQueens had the largest number of foreign-born residents, with 1.1 million, followed by Brooklyn with 992,255 and the Bronx with 514,360.\nThe gardeners at the New Roots Community Farm in the Bronx hail from Guyana, the Dominican Republic, the Central African Republic, Afghanistan, Gambia, Myanmar and the Ivory Coast, among many other places. The garden was started in 2012 by the International Rescue Committee, a refugee services organization, and Bronx Green-Up, an outreach program of the New York Botanical Garden.\nUrsula Chanse, the director of Bronx Green-Up, said that in the last decade, her program had increasingly worked with gardeners from the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America and Africa who have settled in the Bronx. \u201cCommunity gardens reflect the neighborhoods and local demographics,\u201d she said.\nIn the City Line neighborhood of Brooklyn, Bangladeshi immigrants tend a community garden with spinach, winged beans, long beans and bitter melon gourds. The garden was opened in 2014 after a four-year effort by a local group, Bangladeshi American Community Development and Youth Services, to take over a trash-strewn lot.\nSamiha Huda, the group\u2019s executive director, said that home gardening was part of daily life in Bangladesh. Ms. Huda, who lived in the city of Dhaka before moving to New York in 2009, used to grow mangos, lychees, spinach and beans on the roof of her apartment building there.\nNow she can go to the community garden, where the pickings are free for the taking and there are plans for henna painting and story time. \u201cThis garden is open for everyone,\u201d Ms. Huda said. \u201cWe never talk of having a fence, ever.\u201d\nThe United We Stand Community Garden where Mr. Estrada plants was started in the 1990s by Bronx residents and rebuilt and expanded last year by GrowNYC, the organization that runs the city\u2019s Greenmarkets. It has built 100 community gardens since 1975, including 43 since 2013.\n\u201cThere is nothing more beautiful, and quintessentially New York, than people from all over the world working together to build a better community,\u201d said Marcel Van Ooyen, its president.\nThe 15,000-square-foot garden is divided into 51 numbered boxes that are assigned to individual gardeners to plant what they fancy. \u201cThis is my second home,\u201d said Jose Ramos, 89, a retired maintenance worker from Puerto Rico who works in the garden every day in the summer.\nAlex Gonzalez, 44, a deli worker from Mexico, has a box full of tomatoes, green beans, jalape\u00f1o peppers and papalo, a cilantrolike herb used in Mexican dishes. He would grow more, if he had more space. His wife and his brother also have boxes. \u201cThis is fresh,\u201d he said. \u201cI like to eat this way.\u201d\nIn the next box over, Mr. Estrada watered slight green plants that will bear sweet peppers called aji dulce for his wife\u2019s homemade sofrito sauce. She makes enough to freeze for the cold months. \u201cIt\u2019s very expensive to buy,\u201d he said.\nMr. Estrada said he hated working on the family farm in Puerto Rico because he was given no choice. His father used to tell him that they were planting for the rainy days.\n\u201cWhen you have no money, you go to the farm and grab something and then we have lunch,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a necessity.\u201d\nBut years later when his Bronx neighbors started cleaning up a junkyard to turn into a community garden, he did not hesitate to pitch in.\n\u201cI said, \u2018This corner is going to be my garden,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cNow I\u2019m going to make a garden on my own with what my father taught me. I had farming in my blood.\u201d",

    "text": "More than 8,700 Rohingya Flee Myanmar Fighting This Week\n2017-08-29T20:03:05.000Z\nGENEVA \u2014 As fighting in western Myanmar sent thousands of refugees fleeing to Bangladesh, the United Nations top human rights official on Tuesday urged Myanmar\u2019s military to show restraint and accused the office of the country\u2019s de facto leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, of issuing \u201cirresponsible\u201d statements that could endanger international aid organizations.\nUnited Nations officials said more than 8,700 Rohingya, members of Myanmar\u2019s Muslim minority, have fled across the border to Bangladesh from Rakhine state since Saturday, following clashes last week between security forces and a militant group identified as the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army. The fighting was reported to have killed more than 100 people.\nIn comments posted on Facebook on Sunday, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s office said the authorities were investigating reports that staff members of international organizations \u201chad participated\u201d in operations carried out by \u201cextremist terrorists.\u201d It said biscuits supplied by the United Nations food agency had been found at a rebel camp site.\nZeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said on Tuesday that he utterly condemned the violence and that those responsible should be brought to justice. But he also rebuked Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s office for its statements, which he said were \u201cirresponsible and only serve to increase fears and the potential for further violence.\u201d\n\u201cI am extremely concerned that the unsupported allegations against international aid organizations place their staff in danger and may make it impossible for them to deliver essential aid,\u201d Mr. al-Hussein said in a statement issued by his office in Geneva.\nThe comments, which appeared to have been removed from Facebook on Tuesday, pointed to the deterioration in relations between the government and the United Nations since October, when insurgents attacked police border posts in Rakhine.\nMr. al-Hussein lamented the latest upsurge in violence but said, \u201cIt was predicted and could have been prevented.\u201d He said \u201cdecades of persistent and systematic human rights violations, including the very violent security responses to the attacks since October 2016, have almost certainly contributed to the nurturing of violent extremism.\u201d\nIn the security crackdown after those attacks, around 80,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh, bringing accounts of summary executions, mass rape and villagers burned alive in their homes. United Nations investigators who looked into those accounts said Myanmar\u2019s army and police might have committed crimes against humanity.\nMr. al-Hussein said that Myanmar\u2019s authorities should \u201cissue clear instructions to security forces to refrain from using disproportionate force\u201d and that those who use excessive force should be held accountable.\nThe latest attacks in Rakhine have raised alarm among aid and human rights groups that Myanmar may be on the brink of returning to similar violence. On Tuesday, the United Nations said it had suspended aid operations in the state and had relocated noncritical international and national staff members from Maungdaw, the state capital, because of safety concerns.\nMost refugees who crossed the border in recent days were women and children, and there were reports that some were wounded, the United Nations refugee agency told reporters in Geneva. It voiced concern that the number of people needing help would rise in coming days. Thousands more Rohingya were stranded on the Myanmar side of the border, with Bangladeshi guards pushing back many of those trying to get across. The refugee agency called on Bangladesh to open its border and allow those fleeing violence to find safety.\nHuman Rights Watch said Tuesday that Myanmar\u2019s army had built up its forces in northern Rakhine since last week\u2019s attacks. The group said that new satellite images pointed to widespread burning in at least 10 areas of northern Rakhine, covering a larger amount of territory than did the October violence.\nThe cause of the fires could not be identified but some occurred in locations that corresponded with areas where witnesses reported deliberate burning of houses by the military, Human Rights Watch said. It called for international pressure on the government to reveal what is taking place there.\nThe United Nations has set up a three-person fact-finding mission led by a veteran Indonesian investigator, Marzuki Darusman, to look into allegations of human rights violations by military and security forces in Myanmar, particularly in Rakhine. The Myanmar government, however, has said it will not cooperate or allow them to visit.",

    "text": "Myanmar\u2019s Rohingya Actions May Be Genocide, U.N. Official Says\n2017-12-05T21:02:51.000Z\nGENEVA \u2014 Myanmar came under renewed international pressure on Tuesday for its treatment of Rohingya Muslims as United Nations officials said it should be investigated for crimes against humanity and possibly genocide by security forces.\nThe country\u2019s security forces \u201cdeliberately and massively targeted civilians\u201d in operations that drove more than 626,000 Rohingya, half the population of Rakhine State, into neighboring Bangladesh, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, told a special session of the Human Rights Council that convened in Geneva on Tuesday.\n\u201cCan anyone, can anyone, rule out that elements of genocide may be present?\u201d Mr. al-Hussein, said, detailing \u201cacts of appalling barbarity\u201d committed by the security forces since August after decades of systematic discrimination and persecution.\nThe human rights chief had previously described Myanmar military operations in Rakhine as a textbook example of ethnic cleansing. His reference to genocide elevates the charge to the gravest of crimes against humanity: acts aimed at destroying in whole or in part a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.\nThe Rohingya are still fleeing across the border and human rights violations in the area are still occurring, Mr. al-Hussein said. The scale and gravity of the atrocities being reported warrant investigation by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, he said.\nThe Myanmar authorities have made few concessions to international criticism of their military actions against the Rohingya, which appear to be broadly popular with the country\u2019s majority-Buddhist population. On a recent visit to Myanmar, Pope Francis did not publicly use the word \u201cRohingya\u201d \u2014 and drew criticism for that decision. He later said using the term \u201cwould have been a door slammed in the face.\u201d\nThe security forces\u2019 campaign is already the subject of a fact-finding mission by the United Nations Human Rights Council, with a report expected in March. Mr. al-Hussein sought on Tuesday to ratchet up the pressure by urging the United Nations General Assembly to set up a separate body to investigate the individual criminal responsibility of the authorities involved in the operations in Myanmar.\nThe fact-finding team has thus far been refused access to Myanmar, but the team\u2019s chairman, Marzuki Darusman, said it had still been able to collect significant information from refugees and had heard many allegations of \u201cextreme severity,\u201d including genocide.\n\u201cWe have not come to any conclusion on these issues but we are taking such allegations very seriously and are examining them in depth,\u201d he told the council in a recorded video message.\nAdditional investigations by Pramila Patten, the United Nations special representative dealing with sexual violence in conflict, are focusing on reports of widespread sexual assaults by the Myanmar military.\nMs. Patten told the human rights panel Tuesday that she had heard \u201cthe most heartbreaking and horrific accounts of sexual atrocities reportedly committed in cold blood out of a lethal hatred of these people solely on the basis of their ethnicity and religion.\u201d The testimony was collected from Rohingya women who had escaped to Bangladesh.\nRefugees described to her, she said, how women and girls had died while being raped by gangs of men, or raped and then left to die as their houses were burned down. The killing of babies, the next generation of Rohingya, was a recurrent feature in the women\u2019s testimony, she said.\nDiplomats and human rights groups said the council\u2019s special session, convened with unusually wide backing from council members and cross-regional support, underscored Myanmar\u2019s international isolation on the issue and the pressure on its rulers to alleviate the crisis.\nSenior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the army commander, told officers graduating from the Defense Services Academy this past weekend that troops had \u201cstrictly followed orders and acted in accordance with the rules of engagement during the recent Rakhine crisis.\u201d\nHtin Lynn, Myanmar\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, responding at the forum on Tuesday to the grim recital of atrocities, said: \u201cPeople will say what they want to believe. And sometimes they will say what they were told to say.\u201d\nMr. Lynn said Myanmar was ready to work with the United Nations on improving the situation in Rakhine. He said the country was working with Bangladesh to begin repatriation of Rohingya refugees beginning in two months.\nUnited Nations agencies, however, insist that the conditions for voluntary and safe repatriation of refugees do not yet exist. Aid agencies, with the exception of the International Red Cross and the World Food Program, are still barred from working in Rakhine. That has prevented a comprehensive assessment of the destruction after military operations that burned hundreds of villages, or of the assistance refugees would need if they returned.\nNo repatriation should occur without sustained international monitoring of the conditions, Mr. al-Hussein told the council.\n\u201cThe world cannot countenance a hasty window-dressing of these shocking atrocities,\u201d he said, \u201cbundling people back to conditions of severe discrimination and latent violence.\u201d",

    "text": "Is This Genocide?\n2017-12-15T10:45:30.000Z\nSOUTHEAST BANGLADESH, NEAR THE MYANMAR BORDER \u2014 \u201cEthnic cleansing\u201d and even \u201cgenocide\u201d are antiseptic and abstract terms. What they mean in the flesh is a soldier grabbing a crying baby girl named Suhaifa by the leg and flinging her into a bonfire. Or troops locking a 15-year-old girl in a hut and setting it on fire.\nThe children who survive are left haunted: Noor Kalima, age 10, struggles in class in a makeshift refugee camp. Her mind drifts to her memory of seeing her father and little brother shot dead, her baby sister\u2019s and infant brother\u2019s throats cut, the machete coming down on her own head, her hut burning around her \u2026 and it\u2019s difficult to focus on multiplication tables.\n\u201cSometimes I can\u2019t concentrate on my class,\u201d Noor explained. \u201cI want to throw up.\u201d\nIn the past I\u2019ve referred to Myanmar\u2019s atrocities against its Rohingya Muslim minority as \u201cethnic cleansing,\u201d but increasingly there are indications that the carnage may amount to genocide. The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, backed by a Myanmar-focused human rights organization called Fortify Rights, argues that there is \u201cgrowing evidence of genocide,\u201d and Yale scholars made a similar argument even before the latest spasms of violence.\nRomeo Dallaire, a legendary former United Nations general, describes it as \u201cvery deliberate genocide.\u201d The U.N. human rights chief, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, told me, \u201cIt would not surprise me at all if a court in the future were to judge that acts of genocide had taken place.\u201d\nYou judge: Here\u2019s what Noor and her mother, Dilbar Begum, say happened in their village, Tula Toli. First, the Myanmar Army separated the women and girls from the men and boys.\n\u201cThen they shot the men and boys,\u201d Dilbar recalled. \u201cI saw them kill my husband and son. I was screaming.\u201d\nI delicately tried to probe whether Noor had seen the murders of her father and brother, who was just 4 years old.\n\u201cI saw everything,\u201d Noor said, biting her lip. In a rush of words, she added: \u201cMy father was the best man in the world. We were a good team.\u201d\nShe began to cry, and soon my interpreter was wiping away tears, too. And so was I.\nThe Myanmar soldiers herded the women and girls into huts to be raped. Noor and Dilbar were taken into one hut, along with Noor\u2019s 2-year-old sister, Rozia, and another brother, Muhammad Kashel, a baby still nursing.\n\u201cThey took my baby and cut his throat,\u201d Dilbar said in a trembling voice, adding that the soldiers then cut Rozia\u2019s throat, too. Shortly afterward, Noor remembers a machete blade smashing down repeatedly on her own head, her mother screaming in the background. Then she collapsed unconscious.\nDilbar said the soldiers then yanked an earring from her ear \u2014 she pointed to her torn lobe \u2014 and assaulted her beside the bodies of her children: \u201cOne soldier held me down, and another raped me.\u201d When they were finished, she said, the soldiers chopped her on the head with the machete \u2014 she has the same angry scars on her scalp as her daughter \u2014 and left her for dead while setting fire to the hut.\nThe fire and smoke roused her, she said. She checked the bodies of her children and found that Noor was still breathing. Grabbing the girl, she ran into the woods. Dazed, they hiked for two days through the woods to get to the Bangladesh border.\nThe global and American responses have been feeble, so Myanmar is getting away with murder and rape intended to change the country\u2019s demography. The lesson that the world\u2019s complacency sends to other countries is that this is an ideal time to eradicate a vexing ethnic group.\nDaw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, has become the apologist for these mass atrocities. Daw Suu does not control the Myanmar Army, but she has defended the military operation and mocked \u201ca huge iceberg of misinformation.\u201d Her Facebook page scoffed at a Rohingya woman\u2019s report of sexual assault by soldiers as \u201cfake rape.\u201d\nDaw Suu, if you\u2019re reading this, I hope that for a moment you\u2019ll open your heart and listen to the story of Hasina Begum, 21, and her 1-year-old daughter, Suhaifa. (Begum is a common honorific for women.)\nMyanmar soldiers held Hasina and other village women at gunpoint, she said, while the troops executed the men and boys, doused the bodies with gasoline and turned the corpses into a bonfire. Then the troops led the women and girls, five at a time, toward a hut.\n\u201cI was trying to hide my baby under my scarf, but they saw her leg,\u201d Hasina recalled, her voice brittle, her mouth trembling. \u201cThey grabbed my baby by the leg and threw her onto the fire.\u201d\nHasina said she collapsed on the ground, screaming. The impatient soldiers then began to club her \u2014 she showed me scars from the beating \u2014 and dragged her into a hut with her sister-in-law, Asma Begum. The soldiers stripped the women naked and raped them, she said, and finally closed the door and set the hut on fire.\nAs bits of the burning roof fell down on them, Hasina said, she and Asma broke a hole in the side of the hut and ran away naked. They rolled in mud to soothe their burns, and the next day they found a Rohingya house and begged for the man inside to throw out clothes so that they could cover themselves.\n\nA three-day hike took Hasina and Asma to Bangladesh. But Hasina still suffers from the beating and from the emptiness left by the murder of Suhaifa, and she has trouble sleeping.\n\u201cWhen I fall asleep, I look for my baby,\u201d she said. \u201cI wake up screaming.\u201d\nIt\u2019s tempting to say: That\u2019s terrible, but it\u2019s not our problem. But Noor\u2019s plight, like Anne Frank\u2019s in the 1940s, should prick the global conscience, for one lesson of history is this: Crimes against humanity are an offense against all humanity and require a response from all of us.\nThe latest slaughter began in August after a shadowy Rohingya rebel force attacked police and army posts, killing 12 members of the security forces. Myanmar\u2019s Army embarked on a scorched-earth counterinsurgency, and when soldiers couldn\u2019t find rebels, they unleashed their fury on civilians.\nThe brutality varied widely by area, and what happened in Noor\u2019s village was worse than typical. Human Rights Watch says, based on satellite images, that some 345 villages were burned. No one knows exactly what happened to many Rohingya: I searched for people from Rohingya villages I had visited in Myanmar in 2014 and 2015 but couldn\u2019t find them.\nDoctors Without Borders calculated that at least 9,000 Rohingya, including 1,000 small children, died after the army\u2019s attacks, which were undertaken with a savagery that left hardened war correspondents shaken. These attacks involved the systematic use of rape to terrorize the Rohingya.\nOne 14-year-old girl confided her deepest secret: Four soldiers had gang-raped her. She had intended to keep the secret forever, but then she became pregnant and quietly sought medical help. An aid worker helped her get an abortion, but she still hasn\u2019t told even her parents. She shared her story with me only because she is so grateful to the aid organization and it told her that I could be trusted.\nIt\u2019s impossible to know how many women and girls have been raped, but doctors in the refugee camps report a surge in pregnancies as a result of rape, and I encountered two women who suffered fistulas caused by rape.\nThe Rohingya who have reached Bangladesh live in vast, sprawling refugee encampments, where I interviewed them in their tents and shacks; aid organizations provide desperately needed food, water, toilets and medical care, but cannot offer hope. Bangladesh does not want the Rohingya and does not allow aid organizations to teach Bengali, the national language, or to offer an education beyond primary school.\nAn organization called BRAC runs child centers where children are given paper and pens. Their drawings are wrenching: soldiers shooting guns, friends bleeding, huts burning.\n\u201cThat man being shot is Sayid Azam, my neighbor,\u201d said Ismal, an 11-year-old orphan, explaining his drawing of a huge gun firing at a man. \u201cI saw it. I was hiding behind a bush.\u201d\nChina has proposed a plan that would result in the return of the refugees to Myanmar, presumably to live stateless in concentration camps like the ones for Rohingya that I\u2019ve previously reported on. But most are too terrified to contemplate returning. It would be an outrage to force refugees back.\nConsider Shafika Begum, a 15-year-old who may be the only survivor in her family. She said she saw soldiers shoot dead her father and four brothers; they then took her, her mother and her 11-year-old sister into a hut. The soldiers cut her sister\u2019s throat in front of her, and she said that when she screamed, the soldiers clubbed her on the head and knocked her out.\nFlames and smoke brought her back to consciousness: The soldiers had locked the door of the hut and set it on fire. Her mother and sister were dead, and Shafika\u2019s clothes were on fire, but she broke through a wall and fled.\nWas she raped? \u201cI was unconscious, so I don\u2019t know what they did to me,\u201d she said. But she added that someone had rearranged her clothes.\nShafika walked for four days through the jungle to get to Bangladesh. Her back, left hand and both feet are burned, and she has no money to buy burn medicine. I was concerned that interviewing her might traumatize her again, but she was determined to speak.\n\u201cI want to tell the whole world my story,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to tell what happens in Myanmar.\u201d\nThe three people whose stories I\u2019ve focused on \u2014 Noor, the 10-year-old; Hasina, whose baby was thrown onto the fire; and Shafika, disfigured by burns \u2014 are all from the same village, Tula Toli. All these atrocities that I\u2019ve described unfolded on a single dot of the map \u2014 and in every direction there are other villages with tragedies of their own.\nAre the stories they recount true?\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned over the decades (originally while covering China\u2019s murder of Tiananmen democracy protesters in 1989) is that victims lie as well as perpetrators. Outrage leads to exaggerations, to elevated death tolls, to rumors becoming eyewitness accounts. But the attack on Tula Toli has been well documented by human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Fortify Rights, and it is substantiated by satellite photos showing the burned huts. In all, I spoke to seven people who said they were survivors from Tula Toli, and their stories meshed and cross-confirmed one another.\nThere is no easy solution to possible genocide; there never is. But accountability helps, so there should be a major push to prosecute Myanmar military officials in the International Criminal Court. Judges can resolve whether these crimes against humanity also amount to genocide.\nAn open letter from 58 human rights and aid groups has rightly called for targeted sanctions on Myanmar officials. The House of Representatives this month passed a resolution denouncing the ethnic cleansing, and both the Senate and the House have bipartisan legislation pending that would impose sanctions on Myanmar officials, yet it seems unlikely to become law any time soon.\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson has commendably described the situation as ethnic cleansing and has said that \u201cthe world can\u2019t just stand idly by and be witness to the atrocities.\u201d But I fear that\u2019s exactly what is happening. Myanmar may have concluded that its slaughter is a success \u2014 denunciations from bleeding-heart journalists and human rights groups are an acceptable price for eliminating half of its Rohingya population.\nWe do know that international sanctions and pressure matter to Myanmar\u2019s generals, because those were what led them to step back and hold elections. But so far there hasn\u2019t been enough pressure exerted to stop the barbaric treatment of the Rohingya.\nFor individuals wondering how to help, there are fine organizations working on the ground in the camps, among them BRAC, Doctors Without Borders, Save the Children and the Hope Foundation for Women and Children of Bangladesh. First-rate advocacy on behalf of the Rohingya has been led by Fortify Rights, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International.\nA Times colleague asked how I can report on these atrocities and not lose faith in humanity. The answer is that I see not only the evil, but also among the survivors a truly inspiring resilience and courage. I am awed by people like Dilbar, Hasina and Shafika with the physical and mental strength to escape through the mountains and then the moral strength to speak out about sexual violence meant to humiliate them into silence.\nHasina may be exhausted from nightmares about searching for her baby, but she displays a moral clarity that world leaders can emulate. \u201cThey killed my family members, and they killed my world,\u201d she told me. \u201cWhen I tell my story, I feel terrible, and afterward I go cry to myself. But we need justice, and maybe this will help.\u201d\nBrave survivors like her ensure that we will never be able to shrug and say: If only we had known. We know.",

(That outbreak is not food-related. Cholera is endemic there and is being spread to previously clean sources of drinking water by people forced to flee drought and civil war.)\nThe new study, by researchers at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, was published last week in Applied and Environmental Microbiology, the journal of the American Society for Microbiology.\nLarge-scale turtle breeding has expanded rapidly in China, the authors noted. At the same time, turtles infected with the bacteria causing cholera \u2014 Vibrio cholerae \u2014 have been found in shipments throughout Asia, from Bangladesh to Japan.\nThe scientists made Vibrio bacteria easily detectable by inserting into them genes for bioluminescent proteins, then dipped some turtles into a Vibrio solution for two hours before rinsing them off. The researchers also pumped the solution into the stomachs of some turtles.\nWithin days, the scientists found the bacteria growing all over the turtles\u2019 shells, limbs and necks, and in the calipash, the gelatinous green layer beneath the shell that is considered a delicacy in Asia. The researchers also discovered the bacteria in the intestines of some turtles.\nVibrio bacteria flourish in the brackish estuaries where shellfish grow. They concentrate in filter feeders, like mussels and oysters, and attach themselves to crabs and shrimp, thriving on the chitin in their shells, according to a 2009 article in the American Journal of Infectious Diseases.\nThey are not easily removed by rinsing or depuration, a process in which shellfish are stored in sterilized seawater.\nOne of the last cholera outbreaks in the United States took place in Louisiana in 1986, sickening 18 people. Cases were blamed on both crabs and shrimp; raw oysters were also suspected.\nCareless handling \u2014 including holding cooked shrimp in boxes that had held raw shrimp \u2014 contributed to the outbreak.",

    "text": "Not \u2018Lone Wolves\u2019 After All: How ISIS Guides World\u2019s Terror Plots From Afar\n2017-02-04T10:00:40.000Z\nHYDERABAD, India \u2014 When the Islamic State identified a promising young recruit willing to carry out an attack in one of India\u2019s major tech hubs, the group made sure to arrange everything down to the bullets he needed to kill victims.\nFor 17 months, terrorist operatives guided the recruit, a young engineer named Mohammed Ibrahim Yazdani, through every step of what they planned to be the Islamic State\u2019s first strike on Indian soil.\nThey vetted each new member of the cell as Mr. Yazdani recruited helpers. They taught him how to pledge allegiance to the terrorist group and securely send the statement.\nAnd from Syria, investigators believe, the group\u2019s virtual plotters organized for the delivery of weapons as well as the precursor chemicals used to make explosives, directing the Indian men to hidden pickup spots.\nUntil just moments before the arrest of the Indian cell, here last June, the Islamic State\u2019s cyberplanners kept in near-constant touch with the men, according to the interrogation records of three of the eight suspects obtained by The New York Times.\nAs officials around the world have faced a confusing barrage of attacks dedicated to the Islamic State, cases like Mr. Yazdani\u2019s offer troubling examples of what counterterrorism experts are calling enabled or remote-controlled attacks: violence conceived and guided by operatives in areas controlled by the Islamic State whose only connection to the would-be attacker is the internet.\nIn the most basic enabled attacks, Islamic State handlers acted as confidants and coaches, coaxing recruits to embrace violence. In the Hyderabad plot, among the most involved found so far, the terrorist group reached deep into a country with strict gun laws to arrange for pistols and ammunition to be left in a bag swinging from the branches of a tree.\nFor the most part, the operatives who are conceiving and guiding such attacks are doing so from behind a wall of anonymity. When the Hyderabad plotters were arrested last summer, they could not so much as confirm the nationalities of their interlocutors in the Islamic State, let alone describe what they looked like. Because the recruits are instructed to use encrypted messaging applications, the guiding role played by the terrorist group often remains obscured.\nAs a result, remotely guided plots in Europe, Asia and the United States in recent years, including the attack on a community center in Garland, Tex., were initially labeled the work of \u201clone wolves,\u201d with no operational ties to the Islamic State, and only later was direct communication with the group discovered.\nWhile the trail of many of these plots led back to planners living in Syria, the very nature of the group\u2019s method of remote plotting means there is little dependence on its maintaining a safe haven there or in Iraq. And visa restrictions and airport security mean little to attackers who strike where they live and no longer have to travel abroad for training.\nClose examination of both successful and unsuccessful plots carried out in the Islamic State\u2019s name over the past three years indicates that such enabled attacks are making up a growing share of the operations of the group, which is also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh.\n\u201cThey are virtual coaches who are providing guidance and encouragement throughout the process \u2014 from radicalization to recruitment into a specific plot,\u201d said Nathaniel Barr, a terrorism analyst at Valens Global, who along with Daveed Gartenstein-Ross of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington wrote one of the first articles discussing the virtual plotters.\n\u201cIf you look at the communications between the attackers and the virtual plotters, you will see that there is a direct line of communication to the point where they are egging them on minutes, even seconds, before the individual carries out an attack.\u201d\nDetailing this kind of plot direction has become a critical focus of counterterrorism officials in the United States and Europe, as they try to track terror planners who pose a lasting threat and to unravel the criminal networks that the group uses as middlemen to facilitate attacks.\nMr. Yazdani\u2019s case presents one of the most detailed accounts to date of how the Islamic State is exporting terrorism virtually. This style of attack has allowed the terrorist group\u2019s reach to stretch into countries as disparate as France and Malaysia, Germany and Indonesia, Bangladesh and Australia. And plots have been discovered in multiple locations in the United States, including in Columbus, Ohio, the suburbs of Washington and upstate New York.\n\u201cI fear this is the future of ISIS,\u201d said Bridget Moreng, an analyst whose research on the virtual plotters was recently published in Foreign Affairs.\nUntil roughly a year ago, Islamic State recruiters aggressively pushed the message that going to Syria was a spiritual obligation. They described the physical journey as a \u201chijrah,\u201d the Arabic word used to refer to the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s journey to escape persecution in Mecca, imbuing the act with religious meaning.\nThe recruiters hid within an ocean of 2.3 billion live social media accounts, flooding the internet with romanticized videos of life inside the caliphate, as well as brutal execution videos, using them as clickbait to lure potential recruits.\nOne of the Islamic State\u2019s most influential recruiters and virtual plotters was known by the nom de guerre Abu Issa al-Amriki, and his Twitter profile instructed newcomers to contact him via the encrypted messaging app Telegram. Among those who sought him out, asking for instructions on how to reach Syria, was Mr. Yazdani, who had convinced himself that it was his religious duty to move his family to the caliphate.\nBy 2015, Amriki was one of close to a dozen cyberplanners based in Syria or Iraq who were already actively recruiting volunteers abroad, according to a tally based on investigation records from North America, Europe and Asia.\nInitially, they made little effort to hide, posting grandiose threats against the West on public social media feeds. They were sometimes discounted as mere cheerleaders for the terrorist group.\nBut by the late spring of 2015, they were considered enough of a threat that both American and British intelligence began tracking their movements, methodically targeting them with airstrikes and killing several since then.\nAmong them was Amriki himself, who was killed along with his wife on April 22, 2016, when a bomb flattened their apartment in Al Bab, Syria. The Pentagon press secretary, Peter Cook, identified him as a Sudanese citizen also known as Abu Sa\u2019ad al-Sudani, and described him as one of the Islamic State\u2019s \u201cexternal attack planners\u201d who \u201cactively sought to harm Western interests.\u201d\nThe Department of Defense\u2019s account showed, moreover, that the handler had been involved in far more than just the Hyderabad case, planning attacks on three continents.\nAt the same time that he was recruiting Mr. Yazdani, Amriki was grooming attackers in Canada and Britain, as well as at least three other young men in suburbs across America, according to court records. They included a former member of the Army National Guard living in Virginia; a warehouse worker from Columbus; and Emanuel L. Lutchman, a 25-year-old in Rochester.\nLooking for ways to get to Syria, Mr. Lutchman reached out to Amriki on Dec. 25, 2015, asking what it was like to live inside territory controlled by the group. \u201cDream come true,\u201d Amriki responded, before telling the young man that the Syrian border had been closed, according to the criminal complaint.\nInstead, the handler suggested that Mr. Lutchman carry out an attack right at home on New Year\u2019s Eve \u2014 less than a week after their first exchange. Plan an \u201coperation\u201d and kill \u201c1000000s of kuffar,\u201d Amriki instructed him, using a derogatory Arabic word meaning infidel. Over the course of several chats via the Telegram service, they planned how Mr. Lutchman would attack a bar serving craft beer to celebrate the holiday, prosecutors say.\nThe two men discussed recruiting three other \u201cbrothers\u201d to take part. They stayed in contact as Mr. Lutchman went to Walmart, where he spent $40 on two ski masks, two knives, a machete, zip-ties, duct tape and latex gloves. He planned to abduct one of the bar\u2019s customers and videotape himself killing the victim, prosecutors say.\nAnd they exchanged a flurry of messages, as the 25-year-old began to voice doubts and the handler assumed the role of therapist, patiently listening and reassuring him.\nMr. Lutchman was arrested at his home the day before his planned attack on Merchants Grill in Rochester, outed by the accomplice he had recruited, who turned out to be an F.B.I. informant.\nAt the time of his arrest, Mr. Lutchman had been communicating with the handler for a total of five days. It appears he never heard his handler\u2019s voice, or saw so much as a photograph of him, according to the court filings.\nBy late 2015, travel to Syria had become treacherous. Intelligence services on both sides of the Atlantic were getting better at identifying aspiring jihadists, arresting dozens as they prepared to board flights for Istanbul in hopes of crossing into Syria. At first, Islamic State operatives instructed recruits to throw off law enforcement by taking more indirect routes. They also began urging followers to head to other Islamic State colonies, including in Libya.\nThat was what law enforcement officials said a young man from Columbus, Aaron T. Daniels, was trying to do in November, when he was arrested while trying to board a United Airlines flight to Houston, from where he would travel to Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, before continuing toward Libya.\nNo longer describing the journey to Syria as a spiritual necessity, the Islamic State announced last year that those who could not reach the caliphate should attack at home.\n\u201cIf the tyrants have closed in your faces the door of hijrah, then open in their face the door of jihad,\u201d the group\u2019s spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, said in a message released in May.\nAt the time Amriki was killed last April, he had been exchanging messages with Mr. Yazdani in India for more than a year, patiently offering encouragement as his recruit tried and failed to get a visa first to Greece, and then to Turkey in an effort to reach Syria.\nOne of eight children, Mr. Yazdani, who is now 30, grew up in a cramped apartment in the slum of Aman Nagar B, in a narrow alley that smells of sewage in Hyderabad\u2019s Old City. He beat the odds, earning an engineering degree and landing a job as a quality inspector in Saudi Arabia for nearly four years, before returning to India.\nWhile abroad, he began watching the Islamic State\u2019s online propaganda, and soon he became consumed by a desire to leave it all for the caliphate.\n\u201cSince then, I was inclined to join Islamic State and work for the cause of religion,\u201d Mr. Yazdani told investigators from India\u2019s National Investigation Agency, according to his interrogation record, which was obtained by The Times and was first reported by NDTV, a New Delhi-based television company.\nHe logged into Twitter and searched the hashtags #ISIS and #Khilafa, the terrorist group\u2019s preferred spelling of caliphate. In a few keystrokes, he made contact with Amriki.\n\u201cI created a Telegram ID,\u201d Mr. Yazdani told investigators, \u201cand sought his guidance to reach Syria.\u201d\nAfter months of frustrating and failed attempts to help Mr. Yazdani get a visa, Amriki\u2019s directions changed course: \u201cHe asked me to work for I.S. by staying in India itself.\u201d\nIt was a period in which the Islamic State was refining the way it exports terror, increasingly relying on cyberplanners with local knowledge. Just before his death, Amriki handed off Mr. Yazdani to a different handler, known only by his Telegram screen name, \u201cWindsofVictory.\u201d His identity has not yet been confirmed by Indian officials, though they believe he is Indian because he spoke fluent Hindi.\nThe new handler guided the eight-member cell as it took shape, exchanging messages with Mr. Yazdani as the engineer recruited his family members and friends. They named themselves \u201cJund-ul-Khilafa-Fi-Bilad-Hind,\u201d the Army of the Caliphate in India, according to the interrogation records, which misspelled part of the Arabic name.\nAt the end of May, Mr. Yazdani received a message telling him to go to the Nanded Airport, about 200 miles away. He and an accomplice, Habeeb Mohammed, 31, drove all night. After they reached the airport the next morning, the handler told them to head to the Railway Division Office. Near that office, he said, they would see a plastic bag hanging from a tree, according to the transcripts of the men\u2019s interrogations.\n\u201cIt was informed by the handler that opposite to DRM office, there are two trees and on one of the trees there would be a white color polythene sheet (used for wrapping fragile articles),\u201d Mr. Mohammed told investigators. \u201cWe spotted the place, and I, first on the pretext of urinating, went to check for the consignment.\u201d\nWhen they opened the bag, they found two pistols and 20 bullets, according to their account to law enforcement. It was one of at least four drops that the handler set up for them.\nBecause the pistols were rusted, they say the handler instructed them to travel to the railway station in the city of Ajmer, about 600 miles to the north. This time they were told to bring 65,000 rupees \u2014 around $1,000 \u2014 and leave it near the railway track sealed in a plastic bag, which would be picked up and used as payment for weapons.\nBecause the communication always had to go through the handler, the members of the Hyderabad cell never directly interacted with the arms seller. When they were arrested, they could not provide any clues as to who had left the contraband, Indian investigators said.\nThe Hindi-speaking handler guiding the men in Hyderabad also insisted on using a kaleidoscope of encrypted messaging applications, with Mr. Yazdani instructed to hop between apps so that even if one message history was discovered and cracked, it would reveal only a portion of their handiwork.\nAs soon as Mr. Yazdani indicated he was willing to undertake an attack, the handler instructed him to download ChatSecure, a messaging app to be used when they spoke by phone. When he used his laptop, he was told to contact the handler via Pidgin, another encrypted tool. He was told to create an account with Tutanota, a secure email service. And the handler taught Mr. Yazdani how to use the Tails operating system, which is contained on a USB stick and allows a user to boot up a computer from the external device and use it without leaving a trace on the hard drive.\nOnce that system was in place, the handler told Mr. Yazdani to prepare a handwritten oath of allegiance, known as a \u201cbayah,\u201d to the Islamic State\u2019s leader.\nThe members of a cell in Hyderabad, India, signed a handwritten oath of allegiance, known as a \u201cbayah,\u201d to the Islamic State\u2019s leader. An English translation is below.\nMembers of the cell signed it using their noms de guerre, and Mr. Yazdani was told to scan it to his laptop, using Tails to obscure the operation. Next, he was told to upload it to www.gulf-up.com, which allows users to upload files and produces a URL that can be shared with a third party. The link to the URL was to be sent via the secure email.\nBy methodically working through URLs archived on the website, The Times was able to find the image of the one-page handwritten document containing the Indian men\u2019s pledge of allegiance to the Islamic State. The file was uploaded around the time that Mr. Yazdani told investigators he had done so, and the document matched his description of the wording he had disclosed to the authorities. Until they were alerted to its existence, Indian investigators were not aware that the document was still archived on the website, they said.\nThe men\u2019s families have denied that they played any role in a terrorist plot, and accuse the authorities of planting evidence against them.\nOne Indian investigator, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters, said officials were able to crack the full extent of the case only because Mr. Yazdani and his accomplices confessed during interrogation, divulging the passwords to their accounts after their arrests last summer.\nThough the Hyderabad case is among the most detailed in showing how Syria-based handlers directly facilitated terrorist attacks abroad, it is neither the first, nor the only one. Investigation documents from Europe show that a growing share of attacks bear signs of contact with the Islamic State\u2019s stronghold, even though the attacker was initially described as acting alone.\nThe first time that officials in Europe described an attack as having been \u201ct\u00e9l\u00e9command\u00e9,\u201d or remote-controlled, was in the spring of 2015 after a young information technology student named Sid Ahmed Ghlam tried to open fire on a church in the Paris suburb of Villejuif. Instead, he shot himself in the leg.\nWhen the police searched his car, they found his Lenovo laptop containing a series of messages showing how he, too, had been guided by a pair of handlers who provided both the weapons and the getaway car, according to hundreds of pages of police and intelligence records obtained by The Times.\n\u201cOK, brother, now pay attention,\u201d one of the messages begins, instructing the then-23-year-old to head to the suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois, where he would find the automatic weapons in a bag left in a locked car parked near a sandwich shop. \u201cSearch among the cars that are parked there near the big road and look for a Renault M\u00e9gane,\u201d the message said. \u201cLook at the front right tire \u2014 you\u2019ll find the keys placed on top.\u201d\nThe handler then instructed him to store the weapons in another car in a parking garage 10 miles away, a precaution in case his apartment was searched.\nLater, French investigators said they had found that Mr. Ghlam\u2019s handlers were French citizens who had traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State. They, in turn, tapped their criminal network back in France to arrange the logistics of Mr. Ghlam\u2019s plot.\nSeamus Hughes, the deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said the handlers were essentially \u201cquarterbacking\u201d the attack: \u201cThey\u2019re from there, so they can essentially tell someone, \u2018O.K., go 10 yards and go this way.\u201d\nWiretaps, interrogation records and transcripts of chats recovered on suspects\u2019 phones and laptops show that this level of guidance has occurred all over the world.\nIn Germany, a man who set off a bomb outside a concert and a teenager who assaulted train passengers with an ax were both chatting with handlers until minutes before their attacks. The teenager\u2019s handler urged him to use a car instead of an ax \u2014 \u201cThe damage would be much greater,\u201d the handler advised \u2014 but the young man said he did not have a driving permit. \u201cI want to enter paradise tonight,\u201d he said, according to a transcript obtained by a German newspaper.\nIn northern France, a pair of attackers who had been guided by an Islamic State cybercoach slit the throat of an 85-year-old priest. The pair had not known each other, and according to the investigative file, the handler introduced them, organizing for them to meet days before the attack. Intelligence records obtained by The Times reveal that the same handler in Syria also guided a group of young women who tried to blow up a car in front of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris.\nAnd investigations into attacks in Malaysia, Indonesia and Bangladesh reveal that the recruits were directly communicating with Islamic State handlers who molded the plots as they took shape and helped arrange logistics, in some cases wiring money.\nIn several, a pattern has emerged: The attacker initially tries to reach Syria, but is either blocked by the authorities in the home country or else turned back from the border. Under the instructions of a handler in Syria or Iraq, the person then begins planning an attack at home.\nLaw enforcement officials describe that sequence of events in one of the most recent foiled attacks in France, where a group of people are accused of plotting to hit the popular Christmas market in the city of Strasbourg, having been given the GPS coordinates of a location to pick up weapons. At least one of the five men arrested so far had been turned back from Turkey, French prosecutors said.\nWhile a reliance on local amateurs has allowed the Islamic State to announce that it can stage terrorism around the world, it has also led to many failed attacks.\nInstead of opening fire on a church, Mr. Ghlam shot himself in the leg. Instead of laying waste to a music festival this past summer, the Islamic State recruit in Germany detonated his bomb prematurely, killing only himself.\nThe same thing happened the day before the end of Ramadan on July 2 inside a police compound in Indonesia, where another remotely guided attacker hit the switch on his crudely assembled suicide vest.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t even knock over the flowerpot on the ledge next to where he blew himself up,\u201d said Sidney Jones, director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict.\nIndonesian officials say that the suicide bomber had been incited to attack by Bahrun Naim, a 33-year-old Indonesian man who is now one of the Islamic State\u2019s most prolific cyberplanners, operating from the group\u2019s capital in Raqqa, Syria.\nInitially, Mr. Naim wired money to families in Indonesia to pay for travel to Syria, officials said. Later, the bank transfers he sent were to be used to buy the chemicals needed to build explosives, according to the interrogation records of his recruits.\nIn just over a year, the young men with whom he was in touch attempted at least six attacks, targeting a police post, a Buddhist temple and a church, as well as foreigners visiting the country. In November, a college dropout who the police said had at least been initially in contact with Mr. Naim was arrested as he prepared to attack the embassy of Myanmar. In his home, the police recovered a quantity of explosives that could have resulted in a blast twice as powerful as the 2002 Bali bombing, which killed 202 people, the police spokesman told local news media.\nYet nearly all of the plots attributed to Mr. Naim have failed. And it was human error that finally led to the arrest of Amriki\u2019s followers in Hyderabad.\nThe plot began to unravel in June after the men were instructed to collect a 10-kilogram bag of ammonium nitrate left beside a canal next to mile marker No. 9 on the Vijayawada Highway.\nThey returned to Mr. Mohammed\u2019s home to begin preparing a bomb, but could not figure out how to replicate the steps in the instructional YouTube video sent to them by the handler. \u201cWe could not succeed in making powder, as it became jellylike paste,\u201d Mr. Yazdani lamented, according to the transcript of his interrogation.\nThey tried using a tea strainer. They tried heating it longer. They began talking on their cellphones about their efforts to \u201ccook the rice.\u201d\nBy then, the police were wiretapping their calls and suspected that all the food talk was a crude attempt at misdirection. Early on June 29, the police banged on the door of Mr. Mohammed\u2019s home.\nIn his bedroom, they found the half-cooked explosive in his refrigerator.",

    "text": "Far From Myanmar Violence, Rohingya in Pakistan Are Seething\n2017-09-12T09:24:34.000Z\nKARACHI, Pakistan \u2014 It was happening again, but worse than ever: Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Rohingya Muslims were fleeing Myanmar while under attack by the security forces, and the deaths kept mounting.\nEverybody in the vast Arkanabad slum of Karachi has family members who were affected by the government raids that started last month.\nOutside Myanmar, and perhaps now Bangladesh, Pakistan is home to the highest concentration of Rohingya in the world, from a previous exodus of Rohingya in the 1970s and \u201980s. A vast majority live in neighborhoods that are distressingly impoverished even by Karachi\u2019s standards.\nNow they are angry that Pakistan is not doing more to stop the killing in Myanmar, let alone improve the condition of the estimated 500,000 Rohingya who live in this country.\n\u201cThe government needs to do more: Send them more aid, send them food, and break ties with Myanmar completely,\u201d said Noor Hussain Arkani, who leads the Pakistan chapter of a charity in the Rohingya community, the Rohingya Solidarity Organization. \u201cWe need world pressure behind us to end this violence, this hell. Just issuing statements isn\u2019t enough.\u201d\nPakistan was among the earliest and most strident in condemning the Myanmar government for its offensive, which started after Rohingya militants killed members of the security forces. The United Nations said Tuesday that since then, at least 370,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh.\nBut even as politicians and civil society in Pakistan are up in arms over how members of the Buddhist majority in Myanmar are abusing the Muslim Rohingyas there, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya migrants here continue to live in desperation.\nAcross the Arkanabad slum \u2014 named after the old designation for Myanmar\u2019s present-day Rakhine State \u2014 decrepit shanties with temporary walls, often with no doors and windows and unsteady corrugated roofs, serve as homes to more than 100,000 Rohingya.\nThe men mostly work as fishermen, while a small number weave carpets or are employed in garment factories. Malnutrition and diarrhea are common among children who have little access to schools and spend their days playing in rivers of garbage.\nResidents said that up to 30 families shared a single tap of water. But even where running water is available, it often flows for less than four hours a day. There are no hospitals in the slums, and at least six women spoke of having a relative die giving birth because she had been denied admission to government hospitals.\nStill, what people complained of the most in interviews last week was routine harassment by the police. Many spoke grimly of a \u201cBurma Cell,\u201d a special police division responsible for cracking down on Rohingya migrants. (Burma is the former name of Myanmar.)\nMany Rohingya have carried Pakistani national ID cards for years but since the authorities started cracking down on fake versions in 2014, many have found it hard to renew their cards. And the second generation is being denied cards altogether, they said.\n\u201cWithout cards, we are blocked out of jobs, our children can\u2019t apply for admission in high schools and we can\u2019t access government hospitals,\u201d said Mr. Arkani, of the Rohingya Solidarity Organization.\nIn the slum of Burmi Colony, many residents spoke of being forbidden by the police to leave to fish. Mohammad Younis, a fisherman in his 30s, said he had not worked for half a year and his monthly salary of around $600 had shrunk to less than $60.\n\u201cWhen I try and take my nets and go out, I get stopped by the police, who ask for my ID,\u201d said Mr. Younis, whose documents expired six months ago. \u201cI show them documents to prove I am trying to renew my ID card, but they don\u2019t even let me leave the colony.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cWe will die, trapped here without access to our means of livelihood.\u201d\nResidents described arrests of people without cards who were then held either on impossible bail or until they paid a bribe directly to officers.\nMalik Ishfaque, the station house master at the police station under whose jurisdiction many of the Rohingya-majority slums fall, said that officers were duty-bound to crack down on anyone who did not possess valid documents. And while he acknowledged that the Burma Cell used to exist, he said it had been dismantled.\nAsked about instances of harassment and intimidation by the police that some Rohingya had described, Mr. Ishfaque said: \u201cWe act against these people because they are a group of thieves,\u201d noting that crimes like pick-pocketing and robbery in the surrounding area were mostly committed by the Rohingya.\nDespite having little, the Rohingya have been trying to directly help their people back in Myanmar.\nMr. Arkani said the community had raised money to send meat from 30 cows for the new wave of refugees in Bangladesh, as no new refugees were being allowed into Pakistan. The Rohingya Solidarity Organization had also set up a glass donation box, but it was almost empty.\n\u201cWe are so poor already, but even then we try to raise whatever little money we can among ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we need more help from Pakistani people who are rich, who have resources.\u201d\nMany who live here cannot even officially identify themselves as Rohingya. To avoid persecution and be accepted as naturalized citizens, many pretended to be Bengalis who migrated from East Pakistan before the 1971 war of independence, after which it became Bangladesh.\n\u201cYou ask if we have enough to eat or drink, but I ask you: What is our condition when we cannot even say we are Burmese?\u201d said Noor Jabbar, a community elder whose ID card expired three months ago but who has not succeeded in renewing it.\nFor his part, Khalid Saifullah, 70, who migrated from Myanmar four decades ago, described persistent mistreatment. \u201cThey won\u2019t let me be a citizen, because then they have to give me rights and they won\u2019t call me a refugee because then they have to give me aid,\u201d said Mr. Saifullah, showing the high school diploma he had received from a school in Karachi. \u201cI am not a citizen or a refugee. I am an illegal alien. I am nothing.\u201d",

    "text": "New Citizens Hold Their Heads High, 102 Floors Above New York\n2017-08-15T22:08:05.000Z\nOne hundred and two floors above the city, with a hazy view of the Statue of Liberty, 30 immigrants were sworn in as citizens of the United States on Tuesday.\nIt was a morning thick with clouds and redolent with symbolism.\nThis was the first naturalization ceremony to be held at the observatory on the 102nd floor of One World Trade Center. Just days after violence broke out at a white supremacy march in Charlottesville, Va., Robert Katzmann, a federal appeals court judge who is the son of a refugee from Nazi Germany, presided. And Preet Bharara, a naturalized citizen from India who was fired in March as a United States attorney by President Trump, was the keynote speaker. They talked about liberty, equality and the immigrant experience.\n\u201cHow fortunate we are to have you here, contributing your hopes, your aspirations, your skills, your heritages, your music, your culture, your literature, your food to the tapestry of this nation,\u201d declared Judge Katzmann, who is chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. \u201cThe American story is your story.\u201d\nThe newest citizens, from 19 countries including Argentina, Bangladesh, Sudan and Trinidad and Tobago, nodded in recognition, some shedding tears.\nJudge Katzmann, who founded the Immigrant Justice Corps for lawyers training to assist immigrants, spoke about his father\u2019s feeling of freedom when he arrived in the United States, \u201cOf being able to walk on the sidewalks, of not having to fear being accosted because of his religion.\u201d\nIntending his words to \u201cbe timeless,\u201d Judge Katzmann said that he wrote his speech before the weekend\u2019s violence.\nMr. Bharara, the former United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, who joined New York University School of Law as a scholar in residence, invoked his immigrant father, who came from a village in India without running water.\nMr. Bharara\u2019s parents brought their family to the United States more than 40 years ago. Mr. Bharara described his \u201conly in America\u201d success as the first Asian-American U.S. attorney in Manhattan, appointed by the first African-American president. But the new citizens seemed more impressed when he mentioned that his brother, Vinnie, sold his internet company to Amazon for $545 million.\n\u201cWe are bound together in ways that longstanding Americans don\u2019t always appreciate,\u201d Mr. Bharara said. Were his words meant to respond to the anti-immigration rhetoric of the current administration?\n\u201cA restatement of what\u2019s great about the country is never a rebuke to anything,\u201d he said when asked, with a slight smile.\nJoydeep Roy, the one naturalized citizen from India in Tuesday\u2019s ceremony, proclaimed Mr. Bharara\u2019s words \u201cvery moving,\u201d and posed for a picture with him after the ceremony. Mr. Roy, 45, works as an economist for the city and teaches at Columbia\u2019s Teachers College.\nA student of history, he reflected on his own overlapping messages of liberty: Aug. 15 is India\u2019s independence day. He was honored to be chosen that morning to lead his new class in the Pledge of Allegiance, though his family could not attend. His 9-year-old son was at taekwondo camp, and his wife, who was already naturalized, had an important meeting as a senior economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nThe proceedings inspired Hani Ali, 35, an accountant from Sudan, to think about the American dream. \u201cEverybody can do it, it teaches you that \u2018impossible is nothing,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Ali, proudly wearing a red tie and navy suit. The middle child of five siblings, and the only one to live in the United States, he graduated from the University of Connecticut and is a senior manager at Deloitte.\nHe acknowledged that he was upset by Mr. Trump\u2019s executive orders that banned immigrants and refugees from Muslim-majority countries, including his own. But he added, \u201cAfter all, it\u2019s not what the president thinks or says \u2014 America is bigger than that, greater than that.\u201d\nAmid the flag-waving pomp, the new citizens did not get a message or congratulatory letter of welcome from the president. But that was not an indication of the administration\u2019s position on immigration. Creating a new presidential greeting can take a while: President Obama did not have a video message until October, nor a letter until a year after his inauguration, according to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services agency.",

How did you decide if it was something you wanted to give money to? What motivates you to donate, even a small amount, to a person or a charity organization, and why?\nIn \u201cCrowdfunding a Well-Deserved Break,\u201d Tejal Rao writes:\nI had hoped readers would enjoy following a food vendor around on the streets of Manhattan for a day, but I hadn\u2019t expected the story I wrote about Kabir Ahmed to take on a life of its own.\nMr. Ahmed, 46, immigrated from Bangladesh 23 years ago and now works five or six days a week selling chicken biryani and other hot dishes out of a halal food cart in the Financial District. The job is difficult and unglamorous, like many jobs in the food industry. It does not pay well.\nMr. Ahmed\u2019s wife had mentioned to him, in passing, the idea of saving up for a family cruise in the Caribbean. It was a luxury that Mr. Ahmed knew they could not afford for their family of six, but for some reason it had stuck with him.\n\u201cHave you been on a cruise?\u201d he\u2019d asked me on the day I spent reporting with him. \u201cWhat is it like?\u201d At the end of my article (which ran in the Food section on April 19), I wrote about Mr. Ahmed\u2019s longing to go on vacation.\nNot long after my piece was published, readers sent emails asking how they could be helpful. I suggested they buy lunch at food carts, and tip well, especially on rainy days when business slows down. I also proposed learning more about the Street Vending Modernization Act, the New York legislation introduced last fall that would lift the cap on food vending permits, which Mr. Ahmed strongly supports.\nThen one reader, Jennifer Nelson, started a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for Mr. Ahmed and his family and their dream vacation.\nMs. Nelson, a general manager at Buttermilk Channel, a restaurant in Brooklyn, read the article on Wednesday and posted it to Facebook. \u201cI wrote a comment about how I wish I had money to buy this family a vacation,\u201d she said. \u201cImmediately, people started commenting that they wished they did too.\u201d\nStudents: Read the entire article, then tell us:\n\u2014 Did the article make you want to donate to the Ahmed family vacation? Why or why not?\n\u2014 If you did feel as if you wanted to help, how did the reporter\u2019s story get you involved and motivated? What things did you learn about Mr. Ahmed and his family that made you want to help them, even if you didn\u2019t actually donate?\n\u2014 Is there a person or organization you feel is worthy to publicize through crowdsourcing? Who, or what, would you like to start a crowdfunding campaign for, and why?\nStudents 13 and older are invited to comment. All comments are moderated by the Learning Network staff, but please keep in mind that once your comment is accepted, it will be made public.",

    "text": "The Rohingya in Myanmar: How Years of Strife Grew Into a Crisis\n2017-09-13T17:21:32.000Z\nA military crackdown against the Rohingya ethnic group has driven hundreds of thousands of men, women and children from their homes in Myanmar.\nThe Rohingya have faced violence and discrimination in the majority-Buddhist country for decades, but they are now fleeing in unprecedented numbers from violence that the United Nations human rights chief, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, has called \u201ca textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\u201d\nHere\u2019s how an old and bitter dispute has managed to become even more charged.\nThe Rohingya are a Muslim ethnic group that practices a form of Sunni Islam and have lived in Rakhine, one of Myanmar\u2019s poorest states, for generations. Before the latest exodus, an estimated one million Rohingya lived there, but even then they were a minority in the state. The group has its own language and cultural practices.\nSome trace their origins there to the 15th century, an assertion the government disputes. Their name itself refers to the area they claim as home, according to the Council on Foreign Relations: Rohang derives from the word Arakan, the former name of Rakhine State, in the Rohingya dialect, and ga or gya means from.\nMyanmar doesn\u2019t recognize Rohingya as citizens and sees them instead as immigrants from Bangladesh who came to Rakhine under British rule. The country\u2019s first census in 30 years, carried out in 2014, didn\u2019t count the Rohingya; those who identify as part of the group were told to register as Bengali and indicate that their origins were in Bangladesh. The government\u2019s stance makes them one of the largest stateless groups in the world.\nMany live in squalid conditions similar to refugee camps.\nViolence against the Rohingya in Rakhine is part of a \u201clongstanding pattern of violations and abuses; systematic and systemic discrimination; and policies of exclusion and marginalization\u201d that have persisted for decades, according to the United Nations human rights agency.\nSince a 1962 coup in Myanmar, the country\u2019s successive governments have significantly limited the rights of the Rohingya.\nA law passed in 1982 denied them citizenship, leaving them off a list of 135 ethnic groups formally recognized by the government. This limited the Rohingya\u2019s access to schools and health care and their ability to move in and out of the country. The government in Rakhine at times has also enforced a two-child limit on Rohingya families and has restricted interfaith marriage.\nTensions in Rakhine have often erupted into violence, prompting hundreds of thousands to seek refuge in Bangladesh and Pakistan in different waves over the decades.\nIn May 2012, the rape and murder of a Buddhist prompted a series of revenge attacks against Muslims. The violence quickly intensified. The military began a wide-ranging crackdown, and hundreds of thousands fled.\nIn October 2013, thousands of Buddhist men carried out coordinated attacks on Muslim villages throughout Rakhine. Human rights groups say the violence that erupted in 2012 and continued into 2013 amounted to ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. A 2013 Human Rights Watch report said violence in Rakhine was a \u201ccoordinated campaign to forcibly relocate or remove the state\u2019s Muslims.\u201d The response from world leaders, however, has been limited.\nLast October, an armed Rohingya insurgency came to light when militants from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, then known as Harakah al-Yaqin, attacked three border guard posts.\nOver the four months that followed, Myanmar\u2019s army, known as the Tatmadaw, and the police killed hundreds, gang-raped women and girls, and forced as many as 90,000 Rohingya from their homes.\nOn Aug. 25, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army attacked again, targeting police posts and an army base. Security forces cracked down on the wider population, and rights groups accused them of killing, raping, burning villages and shooting civilians from helicopters. The exodus into Bangladesh began: At least 400,000 Rohingya have fled.\nAn additional 12,000 people, mainly ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and other non-Muslims, are also displaced within the state, according to Human Rights Watch. Myanmar has halted humanitarian aid to Rakhine, leaving those still in the state with limited access to food and water.\nMyanmar has framed the actions as a necessary counterinsurgency operation.\nGovernments from several predominantly Muslim countries, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan and Turkey, have expressed concern about the most recent violence. Malala Yousafzai of Pakistan and Bishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa have both called on their fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar\u2019s de facto leader, to do something about the bloodshed.\nMs. Aung San Suu Kyi, who leads Myanmar\u2019s civilian government but does not control the military, has largely avoided public statements about the crackdown and the flight of refugees.\nBut during a phone call last week with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, she complained of \u201ca huge iceberg of misinformation calculated to create a lot of problems between different communities and with the aim of promoting the interest of the terrorists,\u201d according to her office. (On Wednesday, her office said she had canceled a planned visit to the United Nations General Assembly.)\nAnalysts have said that it would be politically difficult for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi to denounce the crackdown, given the military\u2019s political power and the unpopularity of the Rohingya among the country\u2019s Buddhists. Her critics say she has a moral obligation to speak out, and some have called for her Nobel to be withdrawn.",

    "text": "Aung San Suu Kyi, a Much-Changed Icon, Evades Rohingya Accusations\n2017-09-19T03:41:25.000Z\nNAYPYIDAW, Myanmar \u2014 Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and de facto leader of Myanmar, stood before a room of government officials and foreign dignitaries on Tuesday to at last, after weeks of international urging, address the plight of the country\u2019s Rohingya ethnic minority.\nBut those who expected her to eloquently acknowledge a people\u2019s oppression were disappointed.\nIn her speech, delivered in crisp English and often directly inviting foreign listeners to \u201cjoin us\u201d in addressing Myanmar\u2019s problems, she steadfastly refused to criticize the country\u2019s military, which has been accused of a vast campaign of killing, rape and village burning.\n\u201cThe security forces have been instructed to adhere strictly to the code of conduct in carrying out security operations, to exercise all due restraint and to take full measures to avoid collateral damage and the harming of innocent civilians,\u201d she said.\nIt has been a stunning reversal for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, 72, who was awarded the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize for her \u201cnonviolent struggle for democracy and human rights.\u201d\nAs she spoke, more than 400,000 Rohingya, a Muslim minority long repressed by the Buddhists who dominate Myanmar, had fled a military massacre that the United Nations has called a \u201ctextbook example of ethnic cleansing.\u201d The lucky ones are suffering in makeshift camps in Bangladesh where there is not nearly enough food or medical aid.\nA stark satellite analysis by Human Rights Watch shows that at least 210 Rohingya villages have been burned to the ground since the offensive began on Aug. 25. Bangladeshi officials say land mines had been planted on Myanmar\u2019s side of the border, posing a threat to the fleeing Rohingya.\nMs. Aung San Suu Kyi tried to mollify her critics by saying she was committed to restoring peace and the rule of law.\n\u201cWe condemn all human rights violations and unlawful violence,\u201d she said. \u201cWe feel deeply for the suffering of all the people caught up in the conflict.\u201d\nBut, asking why the world did not acknowledge the progress made in her country, she also boasted that Muslims living in the violence-torn area had ample access to health care and radio broadcasts. And she expressed uncertainty about why Muslims might be fleeing the country, even as she sidestepped evidence of widespread abuses by the security forces by saying there had been \u201callegations and counter-allegations.\u201d\nHer speech was remarkably similar in language to that of the generals who had locked her up for the better part of two decades, in the process making her a political legend: the regal prisoner of conscience who vanquished the military with no weapons but her principles.\nMs. Aung San Suu Kyi is the daughter of the assassinated independence hero Aung San, who founded the modern Burmese Army. She is a member of the country\u2019s elite, from the highest class of the ethnic Bamar Buddhist majority.\nOfficials in her government have accused the Rohingya, who have suffered decades of persecution and have been mostly stripped of their citizenship, of faking rape and burning their own houses in a bid to hijack international public opinion. She has done nothing to correct the record.\nA Facebook page associated with her office suggested that international aid groups were colluding with Rohingya militants, whose attack on Myanmar police posts and an army base precipitated the fierce military counteroffensive. In a statement, her government labeled the insurgent strikes \u201cbrutal acts of terrorism.\u201d\nDuring her address, made from a vast convention center in Naypyidaw, Myanmar\u2019s capital, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi tried to evoke a program of grand goals including democratic transition, peace, stability and development.\nBut she also cautioned that the country\u2019s long experience with authoritarian rule and nearly seven decades of ethnic conflict in Myanmar\u2019s frontier lands have frayed national unity.\n\u201cPeople expect us to overcome all these challenges in as short a time as possible,\u201d she said, noting that her civilian government only took office last year. \u201cEighteen months is a very short time in which to expect us to meet and overcome all the challenges that we are facing.\u201d\nThere were worrisome signs from the moment she entered a power-sharing agreement with the military after her National League for Democracy won the 2015 elections.\nMyanmar\u2019s generals \u2014 who ruled the country for nearly half a century and turned a resource-rich land also known as Burma into an economic failure \u2014 stage-managed every facet of the political transition. The Tatmadaw, as the Myanmar Army is known, kept the most important levers of power for itself.\nIt also effectively relegated Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi to the post of state counselor by designing a Constitution that kept her from the presidency.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a dance with the generals,\u201d said U Win Htein, an N.L.D. party elder and former military officer, who served alongside some of the Tatmadaw\u2019s highest-ranking generals.\nHe warned that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi had to placate an army with a history of pushing aside civilian leaders under the pretext of defending national sovereignty.\n\u201cThe army, they are watching her every word,\u201d he said. \u201cOne misstep on the Muslim issue, and they can make their move.\u201d\nYet even before the compromises that accompanied her ascension to power, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi was already distancing herself from the hopes invested in her by the rest of the world.\n\u201cLet me be clear that I would like to be seen as a politician, not some human rights icon,\u201d she said in an interview shortly after her release from house arrest in 2010.\nSuch a recasting of her role has disappointed Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureates. In an open letter, Desmond Tutu, the South African former archbishop, advised his \u201cdearly beloved younger sister\u201d that \u201cif the political price of your ascension to the highest office in Myanmar is your silence, the price is surely too steep.\u201d\nMuhammad Yunus, the Bangladeshi social entrepreneur and recipient of the prize in 2006, was more pointed.\n\u201cShe should not have received a Nobel Peace Prize if she says, sorry, I\u2019m a politician, and the norms of democracy don\u2019t suit me,\u201d he said in a telephone interview with The New York Times. \u201cThe whole world stood by her for decades, but today she has become the mirror image of Aung San Suu Kyi by destroying human rights and denying citizenship to the Rohingya.\u201d\n\u201cAll we can do,\u201d he said, \u201cis pray for the return of the old Aung San Suu Kyi.\u201d\nBeyond her personal legacy, the direction of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s leadership carries global consequence.\n\u201cThis is a democratic moment, and she represents Burma\u2019s democratic promise,\u201d said Derek Mitchell, the former American ambassador to Myanmar. \u201cThe country sits at the crossroads of Asia in a region where democracy is in retreat, which makes Burma\u2019s success even more important.\u201d\nIn Tuesday\u2019s speech, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, acknowledged the state of democracy in her country.\n\u201cWe are a young and fragile democracy facing many problems,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we have to cope with them all at the same time.\u201d\nBut she also stressed that \u201cmore than 50 percent\u201d of Rohingya villages in Myanmar\u2019s western state of Rakhine remained \u201cintact.\u201d And she seemed to borrow vocabulary from a self-help manual when she described the need to research why certain villages had not been touched by the violence.\n\u201cWe have to remove the negative and increase the positive,\u201d she said.\nThrough all of the current Rohingya crisis, and a series of military offensives against other ethnic armed groups, she has publicly supported the military.\n\u201cWe do not have any trust in Aung San Suu Kyi because she was born into the military,\u201d said Hkapra Hkun Awng, a leader of the Kachin ethnic group from northern Myanmar, one of more than a dozen minorities whose rebel armies have fought the Tatmadaw over the decades. \u201cShe is more loyal to her own people than to the ethnics. Her blood is thicker than a promise of national reconciliation.\u201d\nEven before the mudslinging of the 2015 election campaign, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi was sidestepping questions about the sectarian violence in Rakhine that disproportionately affected the Rohingya. Rather than condemning pogroms against the persecuted Muslim minority, she has dismissed accusations of ethnic cleansing and called, instead, for rule of law to solve any problem.\nBecause most Rohingya were stripped of their citizenship by the military, it has not been clear how any laws might apply to them. Even though Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said Tuesday that Myanmar was prepared to repatriate refugees who can establish that they are residents of Myanmar, that may be a formidable task for people who are unlikely to have documents proving that.\nMs. Aung San Suu Kyi has largely shielded herself from the media and has holed up in the capital. Although a year ago, as the nation\u2019s new civilian leader, she attended the United Nations General Assembly, and was celebrated by world leaders, this year she chose not to attend, avoiding criticism of her stance on the Rohingya.\nSeveral heads of state who spoke on the General Assembly\u2019s first day of speeches on Tuesday in New York assailed Myanmar for the Rohingya crackdown, with some describing it as an anti-Muslim atrocity.\nThe president of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, whose country\u2019s population of nearly 200 million is nearly half Muslim, said \u201cthe Myanmar crisis is very reminiscent of what happened in Bosnia in 1995 and in Rwanda in 1994.\u201d The president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose country is majority Muslim and who spoke with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi recently, said the Rohingya had been \u201csubjected to almost an ethnic cleansing, with provocative terrorist acts used as a pretext.\u201d\nMs. Aung San Suu Kyi is attuned enough to public sentiment to understand the deep reservoir of anti-Muslim sentiment in Myanmar. If anything, her equivocations on the Rohingya have given currency to the widely held assumption in Myanmar that they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh who have occupied land that rightfully belongs to the Burmese.\nSince Myanmar\u2019s political transition began, a virulent strain of Buddhist extremism has pushed such attitudes further into the mainstream. Influential monks have preached anti-Muslim rhetoric and pushed successfully for a law that circumscribes interfaith marriage.\n\u201cBuddhist nationalist radicalism has been allowed to spread basically unchecked,\u201d said Min Zin, the executive director of the Institute for Strategy and Policy Myanmar. \u201cThe government is doing very little to stop it.\u201d",

    "text": "Turning the Tide Against Cholera\n2017-02-06T20:26:00.000Z\nSUNDARBANS NATIONAL PARK, Bangladesh\nTwo hundred years ago, the first cholera pandemic emerged from these tiger-infested mangrove swamps.\nIt began in 1817, after the British East India Company sent thousands of workers deep into the remote Sundarbans, part of the Ganges River Delta, to log the jungles and plant rice. These brackish waters are the cradle of Vibrio cholerae, a bacterium that clings to human intestines and emits a toxin so virulent that the body will pour all of its fluids into the gut to flush it out.\nWater loss turns victims ashen; their eyes sink into their sockets, and their blood turns black and congeals in their capillaries. Robbed of electrolytes, their hearts lose their beat. Victims die of shock and organ failure, sometimes in as little as six hours after the first abdominal rumblings.\nCholera probably had festered here for eons. Since that first escape, it has circled the world in seven pandemic cycles that have killed tens of millions.\nArtists of the 19th century often depicted it as a skeleton with a scythe and victims heaped at its feet. It stalked revelers at a masked ball in Heinrich Heine\u2019s \u201cCholera in Paris\u201d and kills the protagonist in Thomas Mann\u2019s \u201cDeath in Venice.\u201d Outbreaks forced London, New York and other cities to create vast public water systems, transforming civic life.\nToday cholera garners panicky headlines when it strikes unexpectedly in places like Ethiopia or Haiti. But it is a continuing threat in nearly 70 countries, where more than one billion people are at risk.\nNow, thanks largely to efforts that began in cholera\u2019s birthplace, a way to finally conquer the long-dreaded plague is in sight.\nA treatment protocol so effective that it saves 99.9 percent of all victims was pioneered here. The World Health Organization estimates that it has saved about 50 million lives in the past four decades.\nJust as important, after 35 years of work, researchers in Bangladesh and elsewhere have developed an effective cholera vaccine. It has been accepted by the W.H.O. and stockpiled for epidemics like the one that struck Haiti in 2010. Soon, there may be enough to begin routine vaccination in countries where the disease has a permanent foothold.\nMerely creating that stockpile \u2014 even of a few million doses \u2014 profoundly improved the way the world fought cholera, Dr. Margaret Chan, secretary general of the W.H.O., said last year. Ready access to the vaccine has made countries less tempted to cover up outbreaks to protect tourism, she said.\nThat has sped up emergency responses and attracted more vaccine makers, lowering costs. \u201cMore cholera vaccines have been deployed over the last two years than in the previous 15 years combined,\u201d Dr. Chan said.\nThe treatment advances relied heavily on research and testing done at the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, known as the ICDDR,B, in Dhaka.\nAlthough Dhaka may not be the first place one might look to find a public health revolution, the center is famous among experts in gut diseases.\nWhile its upper levels are quiet and scholarly, the center\u2019s ground floor is the world\u2019s largest diarrhea hospital. Its vast wards treat 220,000 patients a year, almost all of whom recover within 36 hours. Doctors there save hundreds of lives a day.\nThe ICDDR,B was originally the Cholera Research Laboratory, founded in 1960 by the United States as part of that era\u2019s \u201csoft diplomacy.\u201d Research hospitals were built in friendly countries both to save lives locally and to act as sentinels for diseases that might threaten America.\nThe wards, which in the rainy season extend into circus-size tents in the parking lot, contain long rows of \u201ccholera cots.\u201d On each iron or wood frame is a plastic sheet with a hole in the middle. A bucket beneath the hole catches diarrhea, while another beside the cot fills with vomit. An IV pole completes the setup.\nDefying expectations, the ward smells only of the antiseptic that the floors are constantly mopped with.\nPatients with severe watery diarrhea arrive around the clock, many of them carried in \u2014 limp, dehydrated and barely conscious \u2014 by friends or family. A nurse sees each one immediately, and those close to death get an IV line inserted within 30 seconds.\nIt contains a blend of glucose, electrolytes and water. Cholera spurs the intestines to violently flush themselves, but it does not actually damage the gut cells. If the fluid is replaced and the bacteria flushed out or killed by antibiotics, the patient is usually fine.\nWithin hours, patients start to revive. As soon as they can swallow, they get an antibiotic and start drinking a rehydration solution. Most walk out within a day. The techniques perfected here are so effective that the ICDDR,B has sent training teams to 17 cholera outbreaks in the past decade.\nUsually, the only patients who stay long in the hospital are infants so malnourished that another bout of diarrhea would kill them. They live for up to a month in a separate ward with their mothers, who are taught how to cook nutritious porridges from the cheapest lentils, squash, onions, greens and oil.\nOnly about 20 percent of the patients at the center have cholera. The rest usually have rotavirus, salmonella or E. coli. The same therapy saves them all, but the cholera cases are more urgent because these patients plummet so precipitously toward death.\n\u201cI thought I was dying,\u201d Mohammed Mubarak, a gaunt 26-year-old printing press worker, said one afternoon from his cot. His roommates had carried him in at 7 that morning, unconscious and with no detectable pulse.\nNow, after six liters of intravenous solution, he was still weak but able to sit up and drink the rehydration solution and eat bits of bread and banana.\n\u201cHis stool is changing from rice-water to green, so he is recovering,\u201d said Momtaz Begum, the ward nurse who monitors the buckets and makes sure patients take in as much liquid as they lose.\nMr. Mubarak had first fallen ill at about 2 a.m., a few hours after he drank tap water with his dinner. \u201cUsually I drink safe water, filtered water,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut I drank the city water last night. I think that is what did this.\u201d\nCholera, born in the swamps, arrived long ago in Dhaka. The city is home to more that 15 million, and a third of the population lives in slums. In some places, water pipes made of rubbery plastic are pierced by illegal connections that suck in sewage from the gutters they traverse and carry pathogens down the line to new victims, like Mr. Mubarak.\nVibrio cholerae travels from person to person via fecal matter. In 1854, the epidemiologist John Snow famously traced cases to a single well dug near a cesspit in which a mother had washed the diaper of a baby who died of cholera and nd convinced officials to remove the well\u2019s pump handle.\nBecause cholera is a constant threat to hundreds of millions of people lacking safe drinking water in China, India, Nigeria and many other countries, scientists have long sought a more powerful weapon: a cheap, effective vaccine.\nNow they have one.\nInjected cholera vaccines were first invented in the 1800s and were long required for entry into some countries. But many scientists suspected they did not work, and in the 1970s studies overseen by the ICDDR,B confirmed that.\nIn the 1980s, a Swedish scientist, Dr. Jan Holmgren, invented an oral vaccine that worked an impressive 85 percent of the time. But it was expensive to make and had to be drunk with a large glass of buffer solution to protect it from stomach acid.\nTransporting tanks of buffer was impractical. Making matters worse, it was fizzy, and poor Bangladeshi children who had never tasted soft drinks would spit it out as soon as it tickled their noses.\nIn 1986, a Vietnamese scientist, Dr. Dang Duc Trach, asked for the formula, believing he could make a bufferless version. Dr. Holmgren and Dr. John D. Clemens, an American vaccine expert who at the time was a research scientist for the ICDDR,B, obliged.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t an elegant vaccine \u2014 it\u2019s just a bunch of killed cells, technology that\u2019s been around since Louis Pasteur,\u201d said Dr. Clemens, who is now the ICDDR,B\u2019s executive director.\nHe and Dr. Holmgren lost touch with Dr. Dang, largely because of Vietnam\u2019s isolation in those days. But seven years later, Dr. Dang notified them that he had made a new version of the vaccine. He had tested it on 70,000 residents of Hue, in central Vietnam, and had found it to be 60 percent effective.\nAlthough his was not as effective as Dr. Holmgren\u2019s, it cost only 25 cents a dose. If enough people in an area can be made immune through vaccination, outbreaks often stop spontaneously.\nIn 1997, Vietnam became the first \u2014 and thus far, only \u2014 country to provide cholera vaccine to its citizens routinely, not just in emergencies. Cases dropped sharply, according to a 2014 study, and in 2003 cholera vanished from Hue, where the campaign focused most heavily.\nBut Dr. Dang had not conducted a classic clinical trial, and Vietnam\u2019s vaccine factory did not meet W.H.O. standards, so no United Nations agency was allowed to buy his vaccine.\nBecause no pharmaceutical company had an incentive to pay for trials or factories, his invention languished in \u201cthe valley of death\u201d \u2014 the expensive gap between a product that works in a lab and a factory-made version safe for millions.\nIn 1999, Dr. Clemens approached what is now the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was just getting organized.\n\u201cThey were literally operating out of a basement then,\u201d he said. \u201cI got a letter from Bill Gates Sr. It was very relaxed, sort of, \u2018Here\u2019s $40 million. Would you mind sending me a report once in a while?\u2019\n\u201cBut without that,\u201d Dr. Clemens continued, \u201cthis wouldn\u2019t have seen the light of day.\u201d\nWith that money, Dr. Clemens reformulated Dr. Dang\u2019s vaccine, conducted a successful clinical trial in Calcutta and found an Indian company, Shantha Biotechnics, that could make it to W.H.O. standards.\nRolled out in 2009 under the name Shanchol, it came in a vial about the size of a chess rook, needed no buffer and cost less than $2 a dose. Even so, there was little interest, even from the W.H.O.\nThe vaccine lacked the publicity campaign that pharmaceutical companies throw behind commercial products, and \u201ccholera ward care\u201d was saving many lives \u2014 when it could be organized. The new vaccine was not used in a cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe in 2009, or initially in Haiti\u2019s explosive outbreak in 2010.\nThe \u201cvalley of death\u201d lengthened: Without customers, Shantha could not afford to build a bigger factory. The impasse was broken only when Dr. Paul Farmer, a founder of Partners in Health, which has worked in central Haiti since 1987, began publicly berating the W.H.O. for not moving faster.\nThe agency approved Shanchol in 2011, and since then, the vaccine has slowly gained acceptance. In 2013, an emergency stockpile was started, and the GAVI Alliance committed $115 million to raise it to six million doses.\nThe vaccine is now used in Haiti, and has been deployed in outbreaks in Iraq, South Sudan and elsewhere. A second version, Euvichol, from South Korea, was approved in 2015.\nAnd later this year, Bangladesh \u2014 where it all began \u2014 hopes to begin wiping out its persistent cholera. A local company has begun making a domestic version of the vaccine, called Vaxchol. Dr. Firdausi Qadri, a leading ICDDR,B researcher, estimated last year that success there would require almost 200 million doses.\nThe world finally has a vaccine that, with routine administration, could end one of history\u2019s great scourges. But what will happen is still hazy.\nWith 1.4 billion people at risk, the potential cost of vaccination in cholera-endemic countries is enormous. And the disease tends to move, surging and vanishing among the many causes of diarrhea.\nEven Bill Gates, who paid for much of the research, has asked: \u201cWe actually have a cholera vaccine, but where should it be used?\u201d\nLooking back on his long struggle to prove the vaccine\u2019s value, and then to win acceptance, Dr. Clemens offered an explanation that blended wistfulness and cynicism. \u201cWe\u2019re probably not bad scientists,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we were lousy advocates.\n\u201cIf this disease had been in American kids, there would have been trials as fast as the Salk polio vaccine.\u201d",

    "text": "Pope Francis Rebukes Myanmar Over Treatment of Rohingya\n2017-02-08T17:52:55.000Z\nPope Francis on Wednesday issued a fresh rebuke against Myanmar over its repression of the Rohingya minority group, just days after a United Nations report concluded that security forces had slaughtered and raped hundreds of men, women and children in a \u201ccampaign of terror.\u201d\n\u201cThey have been suffering, they are being tortured and killed, simply because they uphold their Muslim faith,\u201d Francis said of the Rohingya in his weekly audience at the Vatican.\nHe asked those present to pray with him \u201cfor our Rohingya brothers and sisters who are being chased from Myanmar and are fleeing from one place to another because no one wants them.\u201d\nThe pope urged Christians \u201cto not raise walls but bridges, to not respond to evil with evil, to overcome evil with good,\u201d and added: \u201cA Christian can never say, \u2018I\u2019ll make you pay for that.\u2019 Never! That is not a Christian gesture.\u201d\nThe remarks were widely seen as a reference to President Trump\u2019s vow to make Mexico pay for a wall along its border with the United States, though the pope did not mention Mr. Trump by name.\nFrancis also addressed the plight of the Rohingya in 2015, but his latest remarks were his strongest yet on the issue.\nHuman rights groups have repeatedly criticized the crackdown against the Rohingya in Myanmar, formerly Burma, putting Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the country\u2019s first democratically elected leader and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, in an  awkward situation.\nThere were hopes that she would bring an end to the Rohingya\u2019s persecution when she was elected in 2015. Last December, President Barack Obama lifted sanctions against Myanmar, declaring that the government there had made \u201csubstantial progress in improving human rights.\u201d The Trump administration has not taken a clear position on Myanmar.\nObservers say tensions between the Rohingya and Myanmar\u2019s security forces appear to be escalating.\nThe Rohingya, who are Muslims in a primarily Buddhist nation, are denied basic rights, including citizenship, freedom of worship and freedom of travel.\nSince 2012, sectarian violence has displaced more than 100,000 Rohingya from their homes, forcing them to live in what amount to internment camps, where they are prevented from traveling and are forbidden to reclaim land destroyed by conflict. Others have made perilous sea journeys to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.\nPope Francis\u2019 latest accusation came after a United Nations report, released last Friday, said that actions by members of the army and the police were \u201cvery likely\u201d crimes against humanity.\nMore than 200 Rohingya villagers who had fled Myanmar to neighboring Bangladesh gave harrowing testimony to United Nations investigators about the treatment they received.\nThe report said that soldiers and police officers, helped by local villagers, carried out \u201ca calculated campaign of terror\u201d against the Rohingya in Rakhine State after insurgents attacked military posts on the border with Bangladesh, killing nine guards.\nThe report gathered testimonies from witnesses who described \u201cthe killing of babies, toddlers, children, women and elderly; opening fire at people fleeing; burning of entire villages; massive detention; massive and systematic rape and sexual violence; deliberate destruction of food and sources of food.\u201d\nSecurity forces swept through villages shooting indiscriminately with rocket launchers and from helicopters, witnesses told investigators. Those who tried to flee were shot or burned alive in their homes, villagers said. In one case, an entire family, including elderly and disabled people, was locked inside a house and set on fire.\nImams and religious scholars were particularly targeted and some were summarily executed, the report said. The report said the police and soldiers sometimes beat, raped or killed people in front of their relatives with the intention of \u201chumiliating and instilling fear.\u201d\nA 14-year-old girl recounted how soldiers had raped her, beaten her mother to death and killed her two younger sisters. \u201cThey were not shot dead but slaughtered with knives,\u201d she said, according to the report.\nAn 18-year-old girl said that her 60-year-old mother had been caught by the military.\n\u201cShe could not run very well,\u201d she told investigators, \u201cso we saw them catching her and cut her throat with a long knife.\u201d\nMyanmar\u2019s government said it was taking the allegations in the United Nations report seriously and would take \u201cnecessary action.\u201d",

    "text": "Crowdfunding a Well-Deserved Break\n2017-04-25T20:29:53.000Z\nI had hoped readers would enjoy following a food vendor around on the streets of Manhattan for a day, but I hadn\u2019t expected the story I wrote about Kabir Ahmed to take on a life of its own.\nMr. Ahmed, 46, immigrated from Bangladesh 23 years ago and now works five or six days a week selling chicken biryani and other hot dishes out of a halal food cart in the Financial District. The job is difficult and unglamorous, like many jobs in the food industry. It does not pay well.\nMr. Ahmed\u2019s wife had mentioned to him, in passing, the idea of saving up for a family cruise in the Caribbean. It was a luxury that Mr. Ahmed knew they could not afford for their family of six, but for some reason it had stuck with him.\n\u201cHave you been on a cruise?\u201d he\u2019d asked me on the day I spent reporting with him. \u201cWhat is it like?\u201d At the end of my article (which ran in the Food section on April 19), I wrote about Mr. Ahmed\u2019s longing to go on vacation.\nNot long after my piece was published, readers sent emails asking how they could be helpful. I suggested they buy lunch at food carts, and tip well, especially on rainy days when business slows down. I also proposed learning more about the Street Vending Modernization Act, the New York legislation introduced last fall that would lift the cap on food vending permits, which Mr. Ahmed strongly supports.\nThen one reader, Jennifer Nelson, started a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for Mr. Ahmed and his family and their dream vacation.\nMs. Nelson, a general manager at Buttermilk Channel, a restaurant in Brooklyn, read the article on Wednesday and posted it to Facebook. \u201cI wrote a comment about how I wish I had money to buy this family a vacation,\u201d she said. \u201cImmediately, people started commenting that they wished they did too.\u201d\nMs. Nelson did a quick search for Caribbean cruises to estimate the cost for a family of six. Then she started a GoFundMe campaign and set the goal at $3,000. \u201cI hope they can do something that might have seemed a little out of reach before,\u201d she said.\nMany readers felt a connection to Mr. Ahmed, who is one of more than 10,000 people, most of them immigrants, who make a living selling food on the city\u2019s sidewalks. But when I first asked him if I could follow him around for a story in the paper, he was surprised. \u201cA story about me?\u201d he\u2019d asked.\nI explained that it would involve my pestering him all day with questions, but that in the end people might get to know him a little and understand what it\u2019s like to work as a vendor. He said O.K.\nWhen I showed up at his house in Queens, Mr. Ahmed opened the door for me and a photographer, An Rong Xu, clearing toys and snack wrappers from his sofa to make space for us. He opened a box of kaju halwa, a soft, buttery sweet made from cashew nuts, as if we were family. I had to keep reminding him that I was working, too, and he didn\u2019t have to worry about taking care of me.\n\u201cWriting stories is a job?\u201d he\u2019d said, teasing me.\nAt the end of the day, after hopping in and out of his 10-foot-long metal cart a hundred times, jotting down notes on his recipes and watching a series of cute dog videos together, Xu and I both felt lucky to be reporting a story about Mr. Ahmed. \u201cIt was like spending a day with my own father,\u201d Xu wrote to me.\nThis past Friday, a couple of weeks after I had spent that day with Mr. Ahmed, I stopped by his cart to show him that the GoFundMe campaign for his family had reached over $5,000. \u201cI cannot believe this, I cannot,\u201d he said.\nSince the article was published, Mr. Ahmed\u2019s cart has been extra busy, he told me, and everyone seemed to know his name. His wife liked the story very much, he said, and his customers seemed to like it, too. But I wanted to know what Mr. Ahmed thought about it.\n\u201cMy son liked the story,\u201d he said. As we shared a doughnut, it occurred to me that Mr. Ahmed hadn\u2019t read the piece.\n\u201cI started to read it on the train,\u201d he promised me, \u201cbut then I fell asleep. You know, Tejal, I was very tired.\u201d",

    "text": "Pakistan, Let\u2019s Talk About Sex\n2017-09-21T18:47:13.000Z\nKARACHI, Pakistan \u2014 I learned my first lesson about how babies are born from a magazine called Happy Home. It was published by a department of the Pakistani government called the Ministry of Population. The ministry was supposed to encourage people to have fewer babies, and it went about that in a rather coy fashion.\nThe magazine exhorted people to pace themselves; I remember it used the poetic Urdu phrase, waqfa bahut zaroori hai, \u201ca break is important.\u201d I was about 10, and I remember even more clearly the illustration of a small family, a man and a woman and two chubby children, sitting around a stove and eating. I concluded that babies are conceived by sitting around a stove and eating.\nWhen the provisional results of Pakistan\u2019s most recent census came out last month, after massive delays, they seemed to indicate that the message of Happy Home was lost on most Pakistanis, too. Pakistan\u2019s population now exceeds 207 million, an increase of 57 percent since the last census in 1998. Pakistan has become the fifth-most populous country in the world.\nAt this rate, the physicist Pervez Hoodbhoy has warned, in 150 years Pakistan will be a standing-room-only kind of place. Overpopulation will be a terrible strain on natural resources and state services. Already today, every eighth child in the world who is not in school lives in Pakistan.\nI must have read that Happy Home magazine about 40 years ago, but things haven\u2019t changed much here when it comes to conversations about how babies are made. Despite warnings about a population explosion, we still don\u2019t talk about population control. Talking about population control might require talking about sex, and you can\u2019t really talk about sex on prime time TV or the radio, in Parliament or at village gatherings. Ads for condoms are often banned. There\u2019s the occasional valiant attempt \u2014 like Clinic Online, a call-in TV show about sexual health \u2014 but \u201csex\u201d remains a dirty word. As if just saying it was the same as doing it. We don\u2019t even talk about sex with the person we\u2019re doing it with.\nThe Pakistani government could have involved the clergy to dispel the common myth that contraception is somehow un-Islamic, but it hasn\u2019t. There also used to be a myth about the campaign to vaccinate children against polio: That it was a cover for an American conspiracy to sterilize Pakistanis. Then the government got imams to explain on TV that it really wasn\u2019t Allah\u2019s will to cripple the next generation. Yet clerics aren\u2019t preaching that even though God wants you to have good, wholesome sex with your legitimate partner, that shouldn\u2019t stop you from using a condom or taking a birth-control pill.\nPakistan could also have learned from its former sibling Bangladesh, which has had remarkable success at controlling its population by putting women at the center of door-to-door family planning efforts. Bangladesh, which was more populous than Pakistan when it broke away from it in 1971, now has a head count of 163 million \u2014 44 million less than Pakistan. But following Bangladesh\u2019s lead would require acknowledging that women need to be educated about what they can do to not make more babies, and in Pakistan we find it difficult to talk about women\u2019s reproductive health, let alone their sex life.\nSo most Pakistanis are left to figure things out for themselves. Some believe that children come from God and invoke God\u2019s name to resist contraception. Every baby is born with one mouth and two hands, it\u2019s often said. For the poor, children are a potential source of income; in some families, they are put to work at the age of 5 or 6. Since the state seems to feel little responsibility for the poor, the poor are banking on having more children to improve their lot \u2014 hoping those children will rise above poverty and take care of them in old age.\nFor members of the middle class, on the other hand, kids are an expense. With one eye on their bank balance and the other on their children\u2019s future, they find it difficult to comprehend why people who are far poorer than they are have more children than they do. They don\u2019t understand that the process of making babies, then feeding them and putting them to work is the only choice that many poor people have: Even if the poor had only two children, they would still be poor. And sex may be their only fun.\nThe middle-class pundits who tell the poor that their lives would be better if they had two kids instead of five are also making a self-serving statement. Their own family is happier not because it only has two children, but because their parents had enough money (inherited, stolen or earned) for them to be born in a private hospital, be sent to private school and hold their birthday parties in private clubs. When they advise the poor to breed less it\u2019s because they worry that those people\u2019s children will consume the water and breathe and pollute the air of their own precious kids.\nTwo kids or 20, for parents they are all precious. For some, even divine. There are men who believe that by bringing more children into the world they are helping build up the Muslim ummah. Every few years, a silly news story is published about a man with 30 or more children who claims to be having fun doing God\u2019s work. But nobody ever asks the three or four mothers involved in producing all those children if sitting around a stove making food for more than 30 people makes them happy.",

    "text": "Across Myanmar, Denial of Ethnic Cleansing and Loathing of Rohingya\n2017-10-24T04:09:19.000Z\nSITTWE, Myanmar \u2014 The Buddhist abbot tucked his legs under his robes and began to explain.\nRohingya Muslims do not belong in Myanmar, and they never have, he said. Their fertility allowed them to overwhelm the local Buddhist population. But now, somehow, many Rohingya seemed to be gone.\n\u201cWe thank the Lord Buddha for this,\u201d said U Thu Min Gala, the 57-year-old abbot of the Damarama Monastery in Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine State in western Myanmar. \u201cThey stole our land, our food and our water. We will never accept them back.\u201d\nAn overwhelming body of published accounts has detailed the Myanmar Army\u2019s campaign of killing, rape and arson in Rakhine, which has driven more than 600,000 Rohingya out of the country since late August, in what the United Nations says is the fastest displacement of a people since the Rwanda genocide.\nBut in Myanmar, and even in Rakhine itself, there is stark denial that any ethnic cleansing is taking place.\nThe divergence between how Myanmar and much of the outside world see the Rohingya is not limited to one segment of local society. Nor can hatred in Myanmar of the largely stateless Muslim group be dismissed as a fringe attitude.\n[Read: U.N. court orders Myanmar to protect Rohingya muslims.] \nGovernment officials, opposition politicians, religious leaders and even local human-rights activists have become unified behind this narrative: The Rohingya are not rightful citizens of Buddhist-majority Myanmar, and now, through the power of a globally resurgent Islam, the minority is falsely trying to hijack the world\u2019s sympathy.\nSocial media postings have amplified the message, claiming that international aid workers are openly siding with the Rohingya. Accordingly, the Myanmar government has blocked aid agencies\u2019 access to Rohingya still trapped in Myanmar \u2014 about 120,000 confined to camps in central Rakhine and tens of thousands more in desperate conditions in the north.\nThe official answer to United Nations accounts of the military\u2019s mass burning of villages and targeting of civilians has been to insist that the Rohingya have been doing it to themselves.\n\u201cThere is no case of the military killing Muslim civilians,\u201d said Dr. Win Myat Aye, the country\u2019s social welfare minister and the governing National League for Democracy party\u2019s point person on Rakhine. \u201cMuslim people killed their own Muslim people.\u201d\nWhen asked in an interview about the evidence against the military, the minister noted that the Myanmar government had not sent any investigators to Bangladesh to vet the testimony of fleeing Rohingya, but that he would raise the possibility of doing so in a future meeting.\n\u201cThank you for advising us on this idea,\u201d he said.\nThe Rohingya, who speak a Bengali dialect and tend to look distinct from most of Myanmar\u2019s other ethnic groups, have had roots in Rakhine for generations. Communal tensions between the Rohingya and ethnic Rakhine Buddhists exploded in World War II, when the Rakhine aligned themselves with the Japanese, while the Rohingya chose the British.\nAlthough many Rohingya were considered citizens when Myanmar, also known as Burma, became independent in 1948, the military junta that wrested power in 1962 began stripping them of their rights. After a restrictive citizenship law was introduced in 1982, most Rohingya became stateless.\nEven the name Rohingya, which the ethnic group has identified with more vocally in recent years, has been taken from them. The Myanmar government usually refers to the Rohingya as Bengalis, implying they belong in Bangladesh. The public tends to call them an epithet used for all Muslims in Myanmar: kalar.\nThe nomenclature is so sensitive that in a speech this month, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and de facto leader of the government, referred only to \u201cthose who have crossed over to Bangladesh.\u201d\nSome ethnic Rakhine politicians are hailing the Rohingya exodus as a good thing.\n\u201cAll the Bengalis learn in their religious schools is to brutally kill and attack,\u201d said Daw Khin Saw Wai, a Rakhine member of Parliament from Rathedaung Township. \u201cIt is impossible to live together in the future.\u201d\nBuddhist monks, moral arbiters in a pious land, have been at the forefront of a campaign to dehumanize the Rohingya. In popular videos, extremist monks refer to the Rohingya as \u201csnakes\u201d or \u201cworse than dogs.\u201d\nOutside Mr. Thu Min Gala\u2019s monastery in Sittwe, a pair of signs reflected an alternate sense of reality. One said that the monastery, which is sheltering ethnic Rakhine who fled the conflict zone, would not accept any donations from international agencies. The other warned that multifaith groups were not welcome.\nThe abbot claimed that the authorities in Rakhine had stopped a car owned by the International Committee of the Red Cross that was filled with weaponry destined for Rohingya militants who carried out attacks against the security forces in August. Mr. Thu Min Gala claimed that sticks of dynamite had been wrapped in paper with the Red Cross logo. The Red Cross denied these accusations.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t trust the international society,\u201d the abbot said. \u201cThey are only on the side of the terrorists.\u201d\nAt another monastery in Sittwe, an elderly abbot, U Baddanta Thaw Ma, halted my conversation with a young monk by slapping the air in front of my face. \u201cGo! Go! Go!\u201d he yelled in English, before switching to the local Rakhine dialect. \u201cGo away, you foreigner! Go away, you kalar lover.\u201d\nPublic sentiment against Muslims \u2014 who are about 4 percent of Myanmar\u2019s population, encompassing several ethnic groups, including the Rohingya \u2014 has spread beyond Rakhine. In 2015 elections, no major political party fielded a Muslim candidate. Today no Muslims serve in Parliament, the first time since the country\u2019s independence.\nA couple of hours outside Yangon, the country\u2019s largest city, U Aye Swe, an administrator for Sin Ma Kaw village, said he was proud to oversee one of Myanmar\u2019s \u201cMuslim-free\u201d villages, which bar Muslims from spending the night, among other restrictions.\n\u201cKalar are not welcome here because they are violent and they multiply like crazy, with so many wives and children,\u201d he said.\nMr. Aye Swe admitted he had never met a Muslim before, adding, \u201cI have to thank Facebook because it is giving me the true information in Myanmar.\u201d\nSocial media messaging has driven much of the rage in Myanmar. Though widespread access to cellphones only started a few years ago, mobile penetration is now about 90 percent. For many people, Facebook is their only source of news, and they have little experience in sifting fake news from credible reporting.\nOne widely shared message on Facebook, from a spokesman for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s office, emphasized that biscuits from the World Food Program, a United Nations agency, had been found at a Rohingya militant training camp. The United Nations called the post \u201cirresponsible.\u201d\nThe Myanmar government, however, insists the public needs to be guided.\n\u201cWe do something that we call educating the people,\u201d said U Pe Myint, the nation\u2019s information minister. He acknowledged, \u201cIt looks rather like indoctrination, like in an authoritarian or totalitarian state.\u201d\nIn Yangon, Mr. Pe Myint this month gathered local journalists to discuss what he called \u201cfabricated news\u201d by foreign reporters and a \u201cpolitical war\u201d in which international aid groups favored the Rohingya.\nLast month, a mob in Sittwe attacked Red Cross workers, who were loading a boat with supplies that locals believed would only go to the Rohingya.\nEven among officials who might otherwise champion human rights, frustration has been directed at foreign critics. Quietly, some defend Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s failure to call out the military and protect the Rohingya by saying it would be political suicide in a country where hatred of the Rohingya is so widespread. They see the recent international pressure, at best, as ignorant of domestic complexities and, at worst, as intent on hindering Myanmar\u2019s development.\n\u201cWe ask the international community to acknowledge that these Muslims are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and that this crisis is an infringement of our sovereignty,\u201d said U Nyan Win, a spokesman for the National League for Democracy, which shares power with Myanmar\u2019s military. \u201cThis is the most important thing with the Rakhine issue.\u201d\nU Ko Ko Gyi, a democracy advocate who was jailed for 17 years by the military when it ruled Myanmar, also evoked national interest.\n\u201cWe have been human-rights defenders for many years and suffered for a long time but we are standing together on this issue because we need to support our national security,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe are a small country that lies between India and China, and the DNA of our ancestors is to try to struggle for our survival,\u201d Mr. Ko Ko Gyi said. \u201cIf you in the West criticize us too much, then you will push us into the arms of China and Russia.\u201d\nLast month, those two permanent members of the United Nations Security Council shielded Myanmar from an attempt by other nations to condemn the Myanmar military for its offensive in Rakhine.\nThe humanitarian situation has grown desperate within Rakhine while the official block on aid largely continues.\nThroughout the state, ethnic Rakhine have been warned by community leaders not to break the blockade. Last month in Myebon Township, in central Rakhine, women\u2019s activists prevented international aid groups from delivering assistance to an internment camp where thousands of Rohingya have been sequestered since the 2012 sectarian violence, according to foreign staff.\nBut U Tun Tin, a Rakhine trishaw driver, needed the money and delivered food to the Rohingya camp. Shortly after, his wife, Daw Soe Chay, said she was accosted by a crowd that forced her to a nearby monastery.\nInside the religious compound, they beat her and sheared her hair. Then the mob marched her through Myebon, wearing a sign calling her a \u201cnational traitor.\u201d\nDespite his wife\u2019s ordeal, Mr. Tun Tin said he did not regret having sent supplies to the camp, where Rohingya say their rations are running low.\n\u201cThey are human,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to eat, just like us.\u201d",

    "text": "\u2018No Such Thing as Rohingya\u2019: Myanmar Erases a History\n2017-12-02T10:00:24.000Z\nSITTWE, Myanmar \u2014 He was a member of the Rohingya student union in college, taught at a public high school and even won a parliamentary seat in Myanmar\u2019s thwarted elections in 1990.\nBut according to the government of Myanmar, U Kyaw Min\u2019s fellow Rohingya do not exist.\nA long-persecuted Muslim minority concentrated in Myanmar\u2019s western state of Rakhine, the Rohingya have been deemed dangerous interlopers from neighboring Bangladesh. Today, they are mostly stateless, their very identity denied by the Buddhist-majority Myanmar state.\n\u201cThere is no such thing as Rohingya,\u201d said U Kyaw San Hla, an officer in Rakhine\u2019s state security ministry. \u201cIt is fake news.\u201d\nSuch denials bewilder Mr. Kyaw Min. He has lived in Myanmar all of his 72 years, and the history of the Rohingya as a distinct ethnic group in Myanmar stretches back for generations before.\nNow, human rights watchdogs warn that much of the evidence of the Rohingya\u2019s history in Myanmar is in danger of being eradicated by a military campaign the United States has declared to be ethnic cleansing.\nSince late August, more than 620,000 Rohingya Muslims, about two-thirds of the population that lived in Myanmar in 2016, have fled to Bangladesh, driven out by the military\u2019s systematic campaign of massacre, rape and arson in Rakhine.\nIn a report released in October, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said that Myanmar\u2019s security forces had worked to \u201ceffectively erase all signs of memorable landmarks in the geography of the Rohingya landscape and memory in such a way that a return to their lands would yield nothing but a desolate and unrecognizable terrain.\u201d\n\u201cThe Rohingya are finished in our country,\u201d said Mr. Kyaw Min, who lives in Yangon, the commercial capital of Myanmar. \u201cSoon we will all be dead or gone.\u201d\n[Read: U.N. court orders Myanmar to protect Rohingya muslims.] \nThe United Nations report also said that the crackdown in Rakhine had \u201ctargeted teachers, the cultural and religious leadership, and other people of influence in the Rohingya community in an effort to diminish Rohingya history, culture and knowledge.\u201d\n\u201cWe are people with our own history and traditions,\u201d said U Kyaw Hla Aung, a Rohingya lawyer and former political prisoner, whose father served as a court clerk in Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine.\n\u201cHow can they pretend we are nothing?\u201d he asked.\nSpeaking over the phone, Mr. Kyaw Hla Aung, who has been jailed repeatedly for his activism and is now interned in a Sittwe camp, said his family did not have enough food because officials have prevented full distribution of international aid.\nMyanmar\u2019s sudden amnesia about the Rohingya is as bold as it is systematic. Five years ago, Sittwe, nestled in an estuary in the Bay of Bengal, was a mixed city, divided between an ethnic Rakhine Buddhist majority and the Rohingya Muslim minority.\nWalking Sittwe\u2019s crowded bazaar in 2009, I saw Rohingya fishermen selling seafood to Rakhine women. Rohingya professionals practiced law and medicine. The main street in town was dominated by the Jama mosque, an Arabesque confection built in the mid-19th century. The imam spoke proudly of Sittwe\u2019s multicultural heritage.\nBut since sectarian riots in 2012, which resulted in a disproportionate number of Rohingya casualties, the city has been mostly cleared of Muslims. Across central Rakhine, about 120,000 Rohingya, even those who had citizenship, have been interned in camps, stripped of their livelihoods and prevented from accessing proper schools or health care.\nThey cannot leave the ghettos without official authorization. In July, a Rohingya man who was allowed out for a court appearance in Sittwe was lynched by an ethnic Rakhine mob.\nThe Jama mosque now stands disused and moldering, behind barbed wire. Its 89-year-old imam is interned.\n\u201cWe have no rights as human beings,\u201d he said, asking not to use his name because of safety concerns. \u201cThis is state-run ethnic cleansing and nothing else.\u201d\nSittwe\u2019s psyche has adapted to the new circumstances. In the bazaar recently, every Rakhine resident I talked to claimed, falsely, that no Muslims had ever owned shops there.\nSittwe University, which used to enroll hundreds of Muslim students, now only teaches around 30 Rohingya, all of whom are in a distance-learning program.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have restrictions on any religion,\u201d said U Shwe Khaing Kyaw, the university\u2019s registrar, \u201cbut they just don\u2019t come.\u201d\nMr. Kyaw Min used to teach in Sittwe, where most of his students were Rakhine Buddhists. Now, he said, even Buddhist acquaintances in Yangon are embarrassed to talk with him.\n\u201cThey want the conversation to end quickly because they don\u2019t want to think about who I am or where I came from,\u201d he said.\nIn 1990, Mr. Kyaw Min won a seat in Parliament as part of a Rohingya party aligned with the National League for Democracy, Myanmar\u2019s current governing party. But the country\u2019s military junta ignored the electoral results nationwide. Mr. Kyaw Min ended up in prison.\nRohingya Muslims have lived in Rakhine for generations, their Bengali dialect and South Asian features often distinguishing them from Rakhine Buddhists.\nDuring the colonial era, the British encouraged South Asian rice farmers, merchants and civil servants to migrate to what was then known as Burma.\nSome of these new arrivals mixed with the Rohingya, then known more commonly as Arakanese Indians or Arakanese Muslims. Others spread out across Burma. By the 1930s, South Asians, both Muslim and Hindu, comprised the largest population in Yangon.\nThe demographic shift left some Buddhists feeling besieged. During the xenophobic leadership of Gen. Ne Win, who ushered in nearly half a century of military rule, hundreds of thousands of South Asians fled Burma for India.\nRakhine, on Burma\u2019s western fringe, was where Islam and Buddhism collided most violently, especially after World War II, during which the Rakhine supported the Axis and Rohingya the Allies.\nLater attempts by a Rohingya insurgent group to exit Burma and attach northern Rakhine to East Pakistan, as Bangladesh was then known, further strained relations.\nBy the 1980s, the military junta had stripped most Rohingya of citizenship. Brutal security offensives drove waves of Rohingya to flee the country.\nToday, far more Rohingya live outside of Myanmar \u2014 mostly in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia \u2014 than remain in what they consider their homeland.\nYet in the early decades of Burma\u2019s independence, a Rohingya elite thrived. Rangoon University, the country\u2019s top institution, had enough Rohingya students to form their own union. One of the cabinets of U Nu, the country\u2019s first post-independence leader, included a health minister who identified himself as Arakanese Muslim.\nEven under Ne Win, the general, Burmese national radio aired broadcasts in the Rohingya language. Rohingya, women among them, were represented in Parliament.\nU Shwe Maung, a Rohingya from Buthidaung Township in northern Rakhine, served in Parliament between 2011 and 2015, as a member of the military\u2019s proxy Union Solidarity and Development Party. In the 2015 elections, however, he was barred from running.\nHundreds of thousands of Rohingya were disenfranchised in those polls.\nMr. Shwe Maung\u2019s electoral district, which had been 90 percent Rohingya, is now represented by a Rakhine Buddhist.\nIn September, a local police officer filed a counterterrorism suit accusing Mr. Shwe Maung of instigating violence through Facebook posts that called for an end to the security offensive in Rakhine. (The military operation began after Rohingya militants besieged government security posts in late August.)\nMr. Shwe Maung, the son of a police officer himself, is in exile in the United States and denies the charges.\n\u201cThey want every Rohingya to be considered a terrorist or an illegal immigrant,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are much more than that.\u201d",

    "text": "In the Best New Crime, Lethal Lasagna, Honor Killings and Nanny Cams\n2017-07-07T09:01:03.000Z\nHonor-based violence \u2014 which covers everything from beatings and kidnapping to mutilation and murder \u2014 is a scourge in Britain, where the Crown Prosecution Service estimates that the 12 or so honor killings reported each year are only a fraction of the true number committed in Muslim, Sikh and Hindu communities. In LOVE LIKE BLOOD (Atlantic Monthly, $26), Mark Billingham puts human faces on one such case, telling the story of Amaya and Kamal, two Bangladeshi teenagers who run away together to avoid arranged marriages. They make it as far as the London Underground, and the rest is pure savagery.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t an ounce of anything like nobility in what these people do,\u201d Detective Inspector Nicola Tanner hotly informs her colleague Tom Thorne. \u201cIt\u2019s murder, pure and simple, pretending to be something else.\u201d Although \u201cdishonored\u201d male relatives are prime suspects in most cases of punitive violence, squeamish families often prefer to shop the job to a middleman with access to professional hit men \u2014 thugs like Muldoon and Riaz, who collaborate efficiently but whose cultural clashes can be morbidly funny. (Riaz enjoys Bollywood movies, while Muldoon is amused by these musical fantasies about forlorn lovers. \u201cIn a film or whatever, you get to sing about it,\u201d he observes, \u201cbut in real life you get the likes of us turning up.\u201d)\nBillingham allows his plot to wander down some pretty dark alleys. A friend of Amaya\u2019s is gang-raped, considered appropriate retribution for talking to the police. And it\u2019s disconcerting to learn that in Pakistan some honor killings can be forgiven by the victim\u2019s family, with no punishment for the murderers. But Billingham saves his real animus for the Metropolitan Police\u2019s Honor Crimes Unit, which receives 3,000 incident reports a year but doesn\u2019t have a website \u2014 or even a sign on the door. \u201cThere\u2019s a Royal Protection Unit and a Marine Unit and a big, hairy Dog Support Unit,\u201d Thorne notes, but nothing about an Honor Crimes Unit. \u201cIt\u2019s as if it doesn\u2019t officially exist.\u201d Which is what the victims assumed all along.\n\u2666\nDetective Manon Bradshaw was endearingly klutzy in last year\u2019s \u201cMissing, Presumed,\u201d by Susie Steiner. Since she\u2019s five months pregnant in PERSONS UNKNOWN (Random House, $27), she\u2019s even more ungainly, but still endearing, in a novel that\u2019s nominally a mystery but is actually a smart and funny rumination on motherhood. Manon has returned to Cambridgeshire with her adopted 12-year-old son, Fly, to protect him from the indignities of growing up black in London. The irony is that the boy becomes a major suspect in the murder of a London banker who turns out to be the ex-husband of Manon\u2019s sister, Ellie, and the father of her 3-year-old son.\nAlthough the plot \u2014 involving the sleaze merchants of an international prostitution ring \u2014 is a mess, the racial theme cuts deep enough to hurt, and the characters are distinctive. Secondary players like Detective Sergeant Davy Walker, who lives to help others, and Birdie Fielding, a prize specimen of the Beatles\u2019 lonely people, are sweethearts. But since Steiner seems to judge all her characters on the strength of their mothering instincts, the Latvian gangsters don\u2019t get any love.\nMargaret Maron is one of those authors whose devoted fans would follow them anywhere. Now that she has retired her wonderful Deborah Knott series set in North Carolina, readers must head for New York City, the setting of TAKE OUT (Grand Central, $27), the final mystery in another series, which features Sigrid Harald. Lieutenant Harald\u2019s policing may seem old-fashioned, but that\u2019s because the novel\u2019s action takes place in the 1990s. When two homeless men are found dead on a bench, the detective learns they were poisoned by some takeout food. But this part of Greenwich Village is very neighborly and the locals, who include the widow of a mafia don and a former opera star, were always bringing them home-cooked meals. Which one was meant to die? And who delivered the lethal lasagna? Sigrid has a coolly analytic mind; it\u2019s sad to think we\u2019re watching her puzzle out her last case.\n\u2666\nAside from mounting surveillance with a nanny cam, will having an 8-month-old b\u00e9b\u00e9 cramp Aim\u00e9e Leduc\u2019s ineffable style? The modish heroine of MURDER IN SAINT-GERMAIN (Soho Crime, $27.95) and other delicious Parisian mysteries by Cara Black must juggle motherhood with finding a nasty blackmailer, overseeing computer security at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts and hunting down a Serbian warlord. This is Black\u2019s 17th Leduc novel, each set in a different neighborhood, and the formula still charms.\nAlthough the business of the warlord is a lot more interesting than Aim\u00e9e\u2019s bread-and-butter cyber security jobs, finding a babysitter in July and August, when \u201ctoute Paris had disappeared,\u201d is even more challenging. The criminal elements of the story aren\u2019t taxing, but the abiding pleasure of this series is the chance to ride with a cabdriver who wants to discuss Sartre or just tearing around Paris on Aim\u00e9e\u2019s pink Vespa, making stops at the Jardin du Luxembourg and the \u00cele Saint-Louis, where Aim\u00e9e has an apartment.

For those in search of a book that illuminates the here and now, we\u2019ve got \u201cThe Chickenshit Club\u201d (yes, we are printing that title), about why the 2008 financial crisis produced so few prosecutions, and \u201cMaking Rent in Bed-Stuy,\u201d an observation of the challenges posed by gentrification. Two new novels take on serious subjects: honor killings in Bangladesh and Syrian refugees in Greece. For total escape, turn to a rich biography of the 19th-century photographer Nadar or a rollicking account of the Le Mans car race. And if you\u2019re wondering why we all make such wildly different choices, including about what to read, then \u201cBehave,\u201d a book of popular neurobiology, is here to explain.\nEnjoy reading whichever works for you.\nPamela PaulEditor of The New York Times Book Review\nTHE GREAT NADAR, by Adam Begley. (Tim Duggan Books, $28.) In this concise and thoughtful biography, Adam Begley gives a subtle accounting of the career of the 19th-century French photographer Nadar while reminding us of his subject\u2019s many other talents and exploits. (He was a gifted caricaturist, a journalist and editor, and a pioneering balloonist.) Our critic Dwight Garner said that Begley, whose previous book was a biography of John Updike, had \u201cfound a great life to delineate \u2014 this book, like that life, roars past with a whooshing sound.\u201d\nHUE 1968: A Turning Point of the American War in Vietnam, by Mark Bowden. (Atlantic Monthly, $30.) With his signature blend of deep reporting and character-driven storytelling, the author of \u201cBlack Hawk Down\u201d offers a detailed and ambitious history of the 24-day battle that exposed the hollowness of American claims about the Vietnam War.\nTHE CHICKENSHIT CLUB: Why the Justice Department Fails to Prosecute Executives, by Jesse Eisinger. (Simon & Schuster, $28.) Why was virtually no one prosecuted in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis? A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist for the nonprofit ProPublica examines the cultural shifts in the legal and business worlds since the turn of the century that led to solicitous attitudes toward corporations. It\u2019s basically an \u201celites\u201d problem: the prosecutors and the defense attorneys on opposite sides of the table are increasingly the same people, just at different points in their careers. Prepare to be incensed.\nMAKING RENT IN BED-STUY: A Memoir of Trying to Make It in New York City, by Brandon Harris. (Amistad/HarperCollins, paper, $15.99.) Has any borough of this city changed as rapidly and dramatically in the last two decades as Brooklyn? In this searing debut memoir, an African-American critic describes his life as an aspiring filmmaker in a historically black neighborhood, analyzing gentrification and millennial culture.\nBEHAVE: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst, by Robert M. Sapolsky. (Penguin Press, $35.) This quirky, opinionated and magisterial synthesis of psychology and neurobiology offers a better understanding of just where our behavior comes from.

    "text": "He Fled Myanmar on a Deathtrap. Now He\u2019s the \u2018Luckiest Man Alive.\u2019\n2017-11-18T16:06:25.000Z\nDALLAS \u2014 Mohamed Rafiq was emaciated, close to joining the pile of dead bodies at one end of the boat, when he was rescued.\nBarely conscious, Mr. Rafiq was too weak to walk. Foreign sailors picked him up and gave him medicine.\nIt was the first time, said Mr. Rafiq, 39, a Rohingya Muslim, that he had ever been treated with kindness by someone of a different ethnicity.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t even speak because I didn\u2019t know how to move my mouth,\u201d Mr. Rafiq said recently through a translator. \u201cI was so hungry and so thirsty. I wished I could drink, but I could not drink.\u201d When help came, he added, \u201cI thought I was reborn.\u201d\nMr. Rafiq, a member of one of the most persecuted ethnic groups in the world, was fleeing Myanmar in 2008, aiming to find work to support his growing family. But the ferryboat on which he and scores of other Rohingya men fled their country, with benches and no shade, became a deathtrap.\nThe Rohingya in Myanmar are restricted to their villages by laws that prohibit them from traveling within their own country. They are a stateless people denied citizenship, rights and protection.\nAnd abuses against the Rohingya \u2014 shootings, rapes and burning of villages \u2014 have recently intensified to such an extent that United Nations officials have said they may constitute crimes against humanity. The United States secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, visited Myanmar this month and called the situation \u201chorrific.\u201d\nMr. Rafiq and his family, who were separated for eight years, settled together in Dallas last year. Helping Mr. Rafiq reunite with his mother, his wife and their three children was the International Rescue Committee, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.\nAfter his rescue at sea and recovery in Sri Lanka, the International Organization for Migration helped Mr. Rafiq enter the United States and settle in New Hampshire. He heard that Dallas had a larger Rohingya community, so he moved there and began the paperwork to bring his family to America.\nAround age 10, Mr. Rafiq began traveling on foot to sell vegetables and cheap clothing in nearby villages. The police would beat and rob him, he said. He sometimes begged them to let him keep half his earnings, but such pleas were ignored; Mr. Rafiq said the beatings were often so severe that it was painful to walk home. He continued this work until he was about 30, when he had two children and a pregnant wife to support.\nHe decided to join other Rohingya men in an attempt to find work in a neighboring country. Nearly 100 of them crammed onto a boat in February 2008 and set out for what they expected to be a 12-day journey to Malaysia.\nThe engine died at sea. Thirst and hunger set in, killing more than a dozen men. Bodies eventually had to be thrown overboard because the smell was so horrible, Mr. Rafiq said.\nAdrift at sea for four weeks, Mr. Rafiq was stripped of energy and could not move. He watched a friend pass out and die after he drank seawater. \u201cI am ready to die,\u201d he recalled thinking.\nThen the Sri Lankan Navy found the boat drifting in the Bay of Bengal.\n\u201cTwo young men grabbed me by my arms. They pulled me out from the boat,\u201d Mr. Rafiq said. \u201cThey gave me an injection because I wasn\u2019t able to speak. After two or three days I got better, and they gave me soft food, spoon by spoon.\u201d\nMr. Rafiq\u2019s mother, Sara Khatoon, 60, said concern for her son was compounded by the complete lack of news about what had happened to the men on the boat.\n\u201cFor two months after he left I did not receive any information about my son,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know where he was.\u201d\nA tremendous sense of relief spread through the village after the BBC reported that a foreign navy had found a boat full of skeletal men clinging to life. A woman came to Mr. Rafiq\u2019s mother and told her, \u201cYour son survived, and my son survived,\u201d she said.\nMr. Rafiq and the other survivors were brought to a refugee camp in Sri Lanka, where he said he was unable to speak for a month. He made a clawing motion at his throat, saying that it felt so dry that he could not make a sound. When he finally could talk, he asked to call his family. He called the one person in his village who had a cellphone.\nMr. Rafiq\u2019s wife, Nur Hasina, 33, recalled the villager running to her with the phone.\n\u201cWhen I heard his voice,\u201d Ms. Hasina said through an interpreter, \u201cI asked him: \u2018Where have you been? It has been too long. We have not heard anything from you.\u2019 He said: \u2018I cannot explain it right now. It\u2019s a very long story. I will talk to you later, but I am alive and in Sri Lanka.\u2019\u201d\nMr. Rafiq and the other survivors refused to be sent back to Myanmar for fear of torture and execution. He stayed in Sri Lanka for four years, spending most of his time living in group housing provided by the Muslim Aid charity. After arriving in Dallas in 2013, he began working with the International Rescue Committee to reunite with his family.\nHis family had no legal rights to leave Myanmar, so they followed his instructions to sneak into India. They told border guards that they were traveling to Bangladesh for medical treatment, paid bribes and had other relatives furtively pass them their documents over a fence at the border. After two years in India, Mr. Rafiq\u2019s mother, wife and three children arrived in Dallas in August 2016.\n\u201cI was so happy when I saw them,\u201d Mr. Rafiq said. \u201cI was thankful to the U.S. government, the community and the people who helped to have my family reunite with me. I thank all of them, and God,\u201d Mr. Rafiq said. \u201cI have three children, but my youngest one didn\u2019t recognize me. I needed to talk to her a lot, and after that she started talking to me.\u201d\nThe family of seven lives in a two-bedroom apartment with a tiny kitchen in an apartment complex filled with other refugees.\nCongolese and Bosnian children played soccer outside in mid-November as Mr. Rafiq talked of his new life and the arrival of the couple\u2019s fourth child over the summer.\nAsked several times to describe his family\u2019s needs, Mr. Rafiq would say only that he had to keep his 2002 Toyota running to get to his job as a dishwasher and that he faced $4,000 in medical bills for his mother\u2019s high blood sugar. The family says her worries about the relatives she left behind in Myanmar exacerbate her health issues.\nMr. Rafiq walks with a limp and suffers back pain and memory problems from the beatings he once endured. But he says he is living a privileged life.\n\u201cI feel like I am the luckiest man alive \u2014 I can build my life in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cHere it\u2019s easy. I was dying on the boat. Compared to that here, in America, it\u2019s easy.\u201d\nHis gratitude is mixed with anguish about the staggering atrocities unleashed back home on his fellow Rohingya in August. He said he watched news of the mass murders on his cellphone and cried. He worries for relatives who have fled to neighboring Bangladesh and India.\n\u201cI want to donate some money to my sisters and their family in Bangladesh; I won\u2019t use any money here for Thanksgiving,\u201d he said. \u201cI am fine, but they are suffering.\u201d",

    "text": "Indonesians\u2019 Taste for Dog Meat Is Growing, Even as Others Shun It\n2017-03-25T15:40:37.000Z\nJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Parlin Sitio leaned back from a table of empty dishes at a restaurant in eastern Jakarta with a look of satisfaction. He had just enjoyed an order of rica-rica \u2014 dog meat with Indonesian spices.\n\u201cMinimum, I eat it once a week,\u201d said Mr. Sitio, who sells mobile phones for a living. \u201cThe taste is good, and it\u2019s served fresh here. It keeps the body warm and the blood flowing.\u201d\nIn Indonesia, as in some other countries where dogs are eaten, the industry operates largely in the shadows, and reliable data on consumption is scarce. But restaurant owners, butchers, researchers and animal rights advocates agree that more dogs are being killed and eaten here.\nThat makes for a surprising contrast with other Asian countries like South Korea and China, where the practice appears to have been increasingly shunned as incomes have risen, along with pet ownership and concern for animal welfare.\nIndonesia is an example of how economic development can also have the opposite effect, making dog meat newly affordable for people who have no particular objection to it, say people who have studied the subject.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pattern, not just in Indonesia, but throughout the Southeast Asian region,\u201d said Dr. Eric Brum, a veterinarian and a country team leader for the United Nations agriculture agency in Bangladesh, who worked in Indonesia for nine years.\n\u201cSome of these communities have more access to markets and greater disposable income, so there\u2019s more demand,\u201d he said. \u201cAs dog demand increases, there\u2019s going to be more and more production, and more trade.\u201d\nMany Indonesians who are still too poor to eat beef, except on special occasions, can now afford dog or cat, said Brad Anthony, a Canadian animal protection researcher and analyst who lives in Singapore.\n\u201cFrom a strictly practical, agricultural point of view, growing dogs and cats for meat requires far less space and feed resources than growing cows, and is therefore cheaper,\u201d Mr. Anthony said. \u201cThe economics of it all is likely the primary motivator for production and consumption.\u201d\nBesides affordability, many who eat dog meat cite what they consider to be its special health benefits. (The \u201cwarm\u201d quality that Mr. Sitio mentioned alludes to a traditional belief that certain foods have warm energy, others cold.)\nThe Indonesian government does not collect data on how many dogs are killed for food or consumed each year. That is because dogs are not classified as livestock, the way cows, pigs and chickens are. Because of this, the slaughter, distribution, sale and consumption of dogs are not regulated.\nMany Muslims, who make up the overwhelming majority of Indonesians, tend to regard dog meat as unclean, though Islamic tradition does not forbid it outright, as it does pork.\nBut animal rights advocates say the practice of eating dog meat seems to be thriving in Muslim areas, as well as on the island of Bali, the country\u2019s one majority-Hindu province, where it has also traditionally been discouraged. And some of Indonesia\u2019s many ethnic minorities \u2014 like Mr. Sitio\u2019s Batak, who are primarily Christian \u2014 have eaten dogs for centuries.\nThe Bali Animal Welfare Association estimates that as many as 70,000 dogs are slaughtered and consumed on the popular resort island every year.\n\u201cIn our investigations, 60 percent of the customers were Balinese women who felt it was the warmest and most inexpensive form of protein,\u201d said the group\u2019s founder, Janice Girardi, an American who has lived on Bali for decades. \u201cThey believe eating black dogs cures asthma, and maybe other diseases.\u201d\nKarin Franken, a manager for the Jakarta Animal Aid Network, which is trying to collect nationwide data on the subject, said its research indicates that 215 dogs are consumed daily in the city of Yogyakarta and \u201cat least double or triple that much\u201d in Jakarta, the capital. Other regions in Java, Indonesia\u2019s most populous island, serve as supply chains, with stray dogs rounded up or pets snatched off the streets for slaughter, she added.\n\u201cThey trade all over the country,\u201d Ms. Franken said. \u201cIn Yogyakarta, a dish of dog meat and rice is only 8,000 rupiah,\u201d or about 60 cents, she said.\nIn Jakarta, Juniatur Silitonga, whose family has been in the business since 1975, says he slaughters about 20 dogs in an average week. He sells the meat to Batak food stalls in his neighborhood in east Jakarta, as well as to some Korean restaurants around town. He buys live dogs from various suppliers in Java for about $15 each, he said, and sells the meat for about $2 a pound.\n\u201cIt\u2019s cheaper than beef,\u201d he said. \u201cEating dog meat is a tradition among local tribes, and they are mostly Christian, but Muslims also eat dog meat soup for medicinal reasons.\u201d\nMr. Silitonga\u2019s slaughterhouse is in a side room of his dilapidated two-story shop house. The dogs are locked in a second-story room where a fierce stench prevails.\nOne by one, they are taken down a flight of steps to an open room with a concrete pig sty in the back. The dogs are beaten over the head with a wooden club, then stabbed through the throat as they lie unconscious. The blood is drained into buckets and sold to restaurants along with the meat, for cooking purposes.\nDogs are slaughtered much more cruelly on Bali, said Ms. Girardi, the Bali animal welfare advocate. Many are strangled and then butchered immediately, she said, on the theory that strangling them makes the meat more tender. Others are put in sacks and beaten to death.\n\u201cThe cruelty of the dog meat trade in Indonesia shocks me even after years of working on the anti-dog meat campaigns in South Korea, Vietnam and the Philippines,\u201d said Lola Webber, a co-founder of the Change for Animals Foundation, who is based in Bali.\nIndonesia has a law against cruelty to animals, but it applies only to livestock, not dogs, cats or wild animals. Animal welfare activists here have all but given up campaigning against the dog trade on cruelty grounds, because \u201cno one cares,\u201d Ms. Franken said.\nInstead, she said, they focus on the potential for the unregulated trade to spread rabies \u2014 a persistent problem in Bali and elsewhere \u2014 as strays and other dogs are transported from one region to another.\n\u201cIndonesia will never get the rabies problem fixed as long as there\u2019s this underground meat market going on,\u201d said Mr. Anthony, the Canadian researcher.\nLocal governments, including Jakarta\u2019s, vaccinate dogs against rabies but cannot prevent trucks from bringing them in, said Sri Hartati, head of the capital\u2019s livestock and animal health division.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gray area, and we are stuck in the middle,\u201d Ms. Hartati said. \u201cIt\u2019s traditional culture versus animal lovers, and we have no grounds to interfere.\u201d\nMr. Silitonga, the Jakarta butcher, is undeterred by fear of rabies \u2014 he says he has been bitten dozens of times. And he is not without affection for dogs. He keeps one named Luna as a pet.\n\u201cShe\u2019s not for eating,\u201d he said.",

From bloody gladiatorial battles in the Colosseum, to the Derby della Capitale between the soccer archrivals Lazio and A.S. Roma, the city\u2019s stadiums have seen every emotion.\nIt was fitting, then, that this year Rome hosted a cricket match between the Anglican and Catholic churches. Unlike the ancient blood sports, this match fostered unity.\nIt might not look like much, but the match played on Rome\u2019s only cricket pitch was more significant than it appeared.\n\u201cPlaying together builds up its own bond, perhaps more of a bond than at a theological level, where set groups start off from very clear postures and are trying to work together,\u201d said Father Eamon, the manager of the Vatican team.\n2017 was the tournament\u2019s fourth year, and the second time it has been held in Rome. Three teams competed in 2016: the two Christian teams and a Muslim team from Birmingham, England.\n\u201cAt the first match in Canterbury, a Roman Catholic cardinal was given the opportunity to celebrate a Catholic Mass in the Canterbury Cathedral, and as a result early this year there was an Anglican evensong in St. Peter\u2019s,\u201d said Paul Handley, the editor of The Church Times and one of the organizers of the match. \u201cThese things have never happened before.\u201d\nThe Anglican coach, Tom Murray, recalled the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, walking into the dressing room with a pint of beer and telling the team that they \u201cwill never realize how much impact this game has made, for unity; it\u2019s more than we could have achieved in 10 years.\u201d\nThis year\u2019s match retained a competitive edge. The Anglican XI, made up of clergy members and trainee priests, was eager to avenge the defeat they had suffered on this ground two years ago.\nThe youthful St. Peter\u2019s XI had the advantage of being from fanatical cricketing countries like India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, where cricket is preferred to sports like soccer and rugby.\nThe Anglicans put up an almost unassailable lead of 176 for 3 on the strength of a century \u2014 100 runs in a single innings \u2014 from the South African batsman Chris Kennedy. St. Peter\u2019s probably would have needed divine intervention to beat that score, and they were all out for 137.\nAfter the game the players from both sides shared an evening mass and dinner. The St. Peter\u2019s team in their clerical robes sat side by side with their opposition in suits and ties. Nestled in the bag of one the Anglican players was the winners trophy. The Latin words engraved on it were \u201cUt Unum Sint.\u201d\nTo Be One.",

    "text": "Republican Party, Amtrak, Yemen: Your Tuesday Evening Briefing\n2017-12-19T23:16:35.000Z\n(Want to get this briefing by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.)\nGood evening. Here\u2019s the latest.\n1. The Senate passed the Republicans\u2019 sweeping $1.5 trillion tax bill. The House had already approved it, but the chamber will have to vote again because some of the bill\u2019s provisions violated Senate rules.\nHere\u2019s a look at what\u2019s in the final bill, including provisions to tax corporations that operate internationally only on domestic profits. If you pay U.S. taxes, here\u2019s our interactive calculator to help you figure out whether your bill is likely to go up or down.\nIn many ways, the bill represents a political and economic gamble for Republicans. A majority of Americans oppose it, and relatively few believe they will benefit personally from it, polls show.\n_____\n2. The Amtrak train that derailed in Washington State on Monday was traveling 50 miles per hour above the speed limit, federal officials said. Above, pieces of the train were carted away.\nThe train, which careened onto a busy interstate, was on the inaugural voyage of a new route. Two of the three people killed were friends and rail enthusiasts traveling together to experience its debut.\n\u201cThey had wanted to be on that very, very first run,\u201d a friend said. About 100 people were injured.\n_____\n3. The sexual harassment that\u2019s been uncovered in the world of entertainment, media, government and corporations affects blue-collar women, too.\nThe Times spoke with female employees at two Ford plants in Chicago, where a culture of harassment persisted decades after the company tried to tackle sexual misconduct. Tonya Exum, above, said she was groped on the job \u2014 and then found her tires slashed.\nAnd in a bellwether change to end secrecy over harassment claims, Microsoft is eliminating forced arbitration agreements.\n_____\n4. The 27-year-old Bangladeshi immigrant who fumblingly detonated a crude pipe bomb in a New York City subway corridor last week has been charged with several terrorism-related offenses. Akayed Ullah may never leave jail. Above, journalists sought interviews at his family home in Dhaka.\nInterviews with more than a dozen friends, relatives and acquaintances, in Bangladesh and the U.S., paint a picture of a young man who is impulsive, angry, riveted to militant social media and outraged by injustices inflicted upon Muslims \u2014 especially the Rohingya.\n_____\n5. China unveiled an ambitious plan to curb climate change by starting a market for emissions credits. Above, thick smog earlier this year in Henan Province.\nThe long-awaited move puts the world\u2019s No. 1 polluter in a leading position on the issue as the U.S. retreats. Al Gore called it a \u201cpowerful sign that a global sustainability revolution is underway.\u201d\n_____\n6. A large boom startled many in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, around midday. Those who ran outside saw a puff of gray smoke in the sky and black smoke rising from the ground.\nIt was the second ballistic missile fired at the city by Houthi rebels in Yemen in two months, and may have been timed to divert attention from King Salman\u2019s planned announcement of the kingdom\u2019s 2018 budget.\nThe Saudis said they intercepted the \u201cIranian-Houthi\u201d missile without casualties.\n_____\n7. We visited the Mojave, where a \u201chide-and-seek river\u201d defies the desert.\nThe Amargosa flows above and below the ground, creating a unique oasis with incredible biodiversity. It\u2019s home to the world\u2019s rarest fish species, the Devil\u2019s Hole pupfish. There are only 150 left.\nBut the river is under threat from groundwater pumping and efforts to bury nuclear waste nearby.\n_____\n8. The notion that poutine is \u201cCanadian\u201d is giving some Quebecois indigestion.\nQuebec claims the gloppy snack of French fries, cheddar cheese curds and gravy, which has become famous worldwide as a gluttonous indulgence or hangover cure. From Canada.\n\u201cPeople say you can now get cheese curds in Saskatchewan, but it won\u2019t be real poutine,\u201d a Montreal food critic said. \u201cWhen it crosses the border, it loses its authenticity.\u201d\n_____\n9. It was a big year in news \u2014 often big enough to be seen from the sky.\nSatellite images and drone photography captured the eclipse, the Women\u2019s March, hurricanes, fires and other pivotal events that defined a tumultuous year.\n_____\n10. Finally, Trevor Noah looked back at a trying 2017 in a special year-end edition of \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d He said that President Trump presented \u201ca paradox.\u201d\n\u201cEvery day I wake up terrified at the notion that he\u2019s president of the most powerful nation in the world,\u201d Mr. Noah said. \u201cBut I must admit, every day I also wake up knowing he\u2019s going to make me laugh.\u201d\nHave a great night.\n_____\nYour Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.\nAnd don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a.m. Sundays.\nWant to catch up on past briefings?

    "text": "From Cuisine to Apps, Marcus Samuelsson Is Dedicated to Diversity\n2017-10-24T09:00:28.000Z\nIt\u2019s understandable if it seems as though Marcus Samuelsson never sleeps. The affable New York-based chef and restaurateur, who recharged the Harlem dining scene with his restaurant Red Rooster in 2010, recently opened its first outpost, Red Rooster Shoreditch, along with the taqueria Tienda Roosteria, in London. He now operates a total of 15 restaurant brands, from Streetbird Rotisserie, also in Harlem, to Norda Bar & Grill in G\u00f6teborg, Sweden, where he grew up. Two restaurants are planned for downtown Newark and Greenpoint, Brooklyn.\nLast October, Mr. Samuelsson released a cookbook, \u201cThe Red Rooster Cookbook: The Story of Food and Hustle in Harlem,\u201d an ode to the neighborhood\u2019s cultural diversity, and he now narrates a tour of Harlem on the app Detour. \u201cI\u2019m committed to telling a layered journey of the African-American experience, which you have to really dig to find,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people have a strong thirst for this history, and a big part of it is here in Harlem.\u201d\nBelow are edited excerpts from a conversation with Mr. Samuelsson at Red Rooster.\nWhat influenced you to narrate an app tour of Harlem?\nWhen people come to Harlem, they see the Apollo Theater, stop by one of the famous restaurants, take a picture and get back on a bus. I want them to engage with us the way they would in other communities of culture. I\u2019d like for them to go to Marjorie [Eliot\u2019s] Parlor for jazz and see how a bakery looks in our eyes at Make My Cake. In Little Senegal, you can see what a market in Senegal would look like, but in an American city.\nRed Rooster, along with Ginny\u2019s Supper Club, its music-driven sister, were game-changers for the uptown experience. What were your biggest learning experiences with these two venues?\nYou can\u2019t force anything. I didn\u2019t fully understand Harlem and wanted to make sure that I studied it, and not just Lenox [Avenue] and Frederick Douglass [Boulevard], but also [Holcombe] Rucker Park and Charles Gabriel [of Charles\u2019 Country Pan Fried Chicken]. Once I fully understood the community, it was easier to create Red Rooster. Music is something that\u2019s important, so I developed a larger stage for artists, which became Ginny\u2019s.\nWhat led you to open the Red Rooster Shoreditch and Tienda Roosteria in London?\nGrowing up in Sweden, London is always your New York City, especially when it comes to black culture. Red Rooster has a specific song and dance to it. I felt like the space could\u2019ve been in Notting Hill or Brixton, but they\u2019ve changed so much that I didn\u2019t feel like it would reflect our voice. I started to stay in East London and the diversity in Shoreditch was different, with Jewish, Bangladeshi, African and Caribbean influences.\nYou and your wife, the model and philanthropist Maya Haile, are native Ethiopians, and were married in Ethiopia. What was it like to have the ceremony there?\nMy wife has brought me so much love. Being in Ethiopia helped me understand the culture and understand myself. I will always remember it for that because it was so different, and exactly what we needed.\nWhat are some of your favorite Ethiopian foods?\nI love kitfo, raw beef, which came from the Gurage region where my wife is from. It is something that you eat on special occasions. I also love the dulet [a combination of beef, liver, and lamb tripe], which has an incredible level of flavor.\nYou were the guest chef for the first state dinner of former President Barack Obama. How did it feel to take on such a huge task?\nBesides opening Red Rooster, it\u2019s probably the biggest honor that I\u2019ve had as a chef. The idea of being an immigrant in this country and cooking at the White House was amazing. Up until that point, most state dinners featured French food, but I thought we should have food connected to the guest of honor [then-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India]. Vegetarian courses with Indian influences were highlighted. We worked with purveyors from the Gulf Coast and used American wines.\nWhat do you miss the most about living in Sweden?\nI miss the real access to nature; it was never a field trip for us. During my school years, we would go in the woods and pick berries or mushrooms. It was unplanned, just like hanging out with your friends.\nIn 2015, you ran the New York City Marathon, the largest marathon in the world. What was it like to train for the race?\nI enjoy the thinking process of getting up early. I was in the middle of writing the Red Rooster cookbook at the time, so I listened to many of my interviews to help me understand things. I\u2019m one of the slowest Ethiopians and one of the fastest Swedes that you\u2019ll ever find.",

    "text": "Giving Capitalism a Social Conscience\n2017-10-10T07:21:26.000Z\nFor more than 40 years, Muhammad Yunus, the Bangladeshi founder of the Grameen Bank and recipient of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, has been asserting that the most powerful way to eradicate poverty is to unleash the untapped entrepreneurial capacity of people everywhere. \u201cPoverty is not created by poor people,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s created by the system we built. Poor people are like a bonsai tree. You take the best seed from the tallest tree in the forest, but if you put it in a flower pot to grow, it grows only a meter high. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the seed. The problem is the size of the pot. Society doesn\u2019t give poor people the space to grow as tall as everybody else. This is the crux of the matter.\u201d\nYunus has recently written a new book, \u201cA World of Three Zeros: The New Economics of Zero Poverty, Zero Unemployment, and Zero Net Carbon Emissions,\u201d in which he argues that capitalism is in crisis and remains moored in a flawed conception of human motivation. He proposes a far more robust role in the economy for \u201csocial businesses,\u201d which he defines as \u201cnon-dividend\u201d companies \u201cdedicated to solving human problems.\u201d\nAt 77, Yunus shows no signs of slowing down. He reports on an astonishing array of work he has been involved in \u2014 supporting and codeveloping social businesses (often in partnership with large corporations) in Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, France, Haiti, India, Japan, Uganda and numerous other countries.\n\u201cWe need to abandon our unquestioning faith in the power of personal-profit-centered markets to solve all problems and confess that the problems of inequality are not going to be solved by the natural working of the economy as it is currently structured,\u201d Yunus writes.\n\u201cThis is not a comfortable situation for anyone, including those who are on top of the social heap at any given time. Do the wealthy and powerful \u2026 like having to avert their eyes from the homeless and hungry people they pass on the street? Do they enjoy using the tools of the state \u2014 including its police powers and other forms of coercion \u2014 to suppress the inevitable protests mounted by those on the bottom? Do they really want their own children and grandchildren to inherit this kind of world?\u201d\nI sat down with Yunus last week to discuss his new book.\nDavid Bornstein: This is both a solutions book and a warning call. What is the danger?\nMuhammad Yunus: Wealth concentration. In the book, I cite an Oxfam report that says that eight people own more wealth than the bottom 50 percent of the world. Recently, I saw a newspaper report that said now it\u2019s just five people. There are two things to be concerned about: the concentration of wealth and the increasing speed of this concentration. We didn\u2019t notice it when 5,000 people or 50,000 people owned more wealth than the bottom half of the world. Now it\u2019s five people. In a year or two it will be just one person. This is the speed at which it is happening.\nThe capitalist system is a machine which sucks up wealth from the bottom to send it to the top. It\u2019s not the fault of individuals at the top. They follow what the system asks them to do: chase money. But in the process, wealth at the top grows like a giant mushroom owned by fewer and fewer people \u2014 for the simple reason that the more they have, the more they get. Wealth is a magnet. If you have a little magnet, you attract a little wealth. If you have a big magnet, you attract more. And this wealth mushroom is worse than the atomic mushroom cloud. It will destroy our politics, it will destroy our society, it will destroy our economy \u2014 because concentration of wealth goes with concentration of power. This will generate tremendous anger at the bottom, and that anger will disrupt everything. Brexit is the outcome of this anger. Same with the recent U.S. election. Now see the German election. This mushroom is a ticking time bomb. We need to spend many sleepless nights over it.\nD.B.: You say that this problem lies at the root of capitalist theory.\nM.Y.: The capitalist system is based on a fundamental flaw, on misinterpretation of human beings. In capitalist theory, it is assumed that man is entirely driven by self-interest. That\u2019s definitely not the description of a real human being. Human beings are selfish, and at the same time they are equally selfless, if not more. They want to help others. Adam Smith wrote this in \u201cThe Theory of Moral Sentiments.\u201d He was a professor of philosophy. He was interested in morality. Then he wrote a completely different book that talked about self-interest and the \u201cinvisible hand.\u201d The first book was forgotten. He never integrated the two books.\nD.B.: If we integrated these ideas, what would be the implications?\nM.Y.: Capitalism is all about options. But in the economic system, there is only one kind of business: business to make money \u2014 and it\u2019s made more extreme by saying it produces best results when one maximizes profit. When we introduce the selflessness of people in the business world we get another option. Alongside conventional business, we add another type of business that will allow us to express our selflessness through business. The exclusive goal of this business, which I call social business, is to solve people\u2019s problems. My book is full of examples of this.\nD.B.: I suspect some readers will think, \u201cThis sounds idealistic.\u201d\nM.Y.: Actually it\u2019s very practical. Hard-nosed business people come to me all the time and volunteer to create social businesses. Like the Canadian company McCain Foods. They wanted to create a social business jointly with us. They have 60 percent of the French fry market in the world. Jointly we are doing a social business in Colombia. Many Colombian farmers struggle to make a living, like in many other countries. Campo Vivo, our social business, helps farmers grow potatoes and vegetables with high yields.\nAfter that, they created another social business in France, where 26 percent of potatoes are wasted because they\u2019re of a wrong shape for the French fry-making machines. Once McCain put on social business glasses, they started seeing new possibilities. They created Bon et Bien to buy up these potatoes and produce potato soup. They hire youth who have been unemployed. Then they noticed that 30 percent of vegetables grown across Europe are thrown away because they don\u2019t have the right shape for supermarkets. They are called \u201cugly vegetables.\u201d The social business company buys up these throwaway vegetables and chops them up, making small packages of ready-to-cook vegetables. They could make money from this, but they decided not to \u2014 to make the soup and vegetables good and cheap.\nD.B.: Ordinary businesses solve problems all the time. What do we gain by removing the profit motive?\nM.Y.: If you remove the personal profit motive and think only about solving problems, you will suddenly see lots of possibilities that you didn\u2019t see before. If selflessness becomes the driving force behind development of technology instead of personal profit, suddenly technology transforms into an enormously powerful force to change the world very rapidly. Then artificial intelligence will be developed to solve health care problems of people instead of taking away jobs. If you focus on the selfless part of human beings, the whole economy changes.\nD.B.: Where\u2019s the financing to come from?\nM.Y.: From many directions. Charity money can be a major source. Many are creating social business funds. Personal wealth can be an important source. Hedge funds or insurance funds, pension funds, could take 1 percent of their fund and invest it in social business, with no expectation of personal profit. You\u2019d release enormous amounts of money.\nD.B.: What do you say to business leaders who are interested?\nM.Y.: Try it out. Use part of your wealth or corporate social responsibility money or foundation money to invest in social businesses. One may convene a design competition for businesses that address one of the sustainable development goals that you care about. You\u2019ll get lots of business ideas. Pick one or two and start investing in them. Not for publicity purposes. Make sure it really solves people\u2019s problems. You\u2019ll also learn a lot about yourself by doing it.\nD.B.: How is your work in the United States, Grameen America, going?\nM.Y.: We started in 2008. By the end of next year, Grameen America will have lent almost $1 billion to 100,000 borrowers, with repayment remaining nearly 100 percent. Over the next 10 years, Grameen America would like to double from 20 to 40 branches. Even with that modest growth, it can reach 500,000 borrowers by 2028. If more generous funding were available, it could reach a million borrowers. If it had a limited banking license, it could take deposits like we do in the Grameen Bank and its expansion will not be limited by availability of funds.\nD.B.: You see young people as one of the \u201cmegapowers\u201d that can transform the world. Why youth?\nM.Y.: Their minds are open. They are not so protective of the capitalist system. They can think boldly. They have a lot of power, they understand technology, and they have a hunger to do something significant.\nD.B.: What would you like to see schools do?\nM.Y.: Bring into the curriculum the idea that business doesn\u2019t have to be profit maximizing. You can design it to solve people\u2019s problems while you recover your costs and recycle your money. They can have assignments to design businesses to solve problems: how to bring clean water to a village; how to bring education, literacy, housing or health care to a remote community; how to make a crowded slum a decent place where there is health care, education, good roads. There are many universities setting up social business centers and teaching this. Every business school should be offering both conventional M.B.A.s and social M.B.A.s.\nD.B.: You attract people around the world who are challenging traditional ideas about business. What do you find they have in common?\nM.Y.: Excitement. Once you\u2019re bitten by this social business bug, you can\u2019t stop. If making money leads to happiness, making other people happy leads to super-happiness.\nD.B.: When you look ahead 10 years from now, what do you envision?\nM.Y.: I\u2019m guessing or hoping that at least 1 percent of the economy will become a social business economy at the global level. If you can establish that, the bug will have bitten. The only way will be up.\nD.B.: Do you think you could have become very wealthy if you\u2019d pursued that goal?\nM.Y.: Could be. I\u2019ve created a lot of businesses. But I don\u2019t own a single share in any company anywhere in the world. I\u2019m not missing anything. I\u2019m doing things that I care about, and people pay attention, people want to learn and listen, and, after all, what is life all about? To make billions of dollars? For each of those five people who hold more wealth than the bottom 50 percent of the world, their wealth is equivalent to the wealth of 750 million people! What do you do with that? Eat? Have homes? Listen to music? Give it away? For me, in the world of economic activity, social business is the most creative way to be happy, to enjoy life.",

    "text": "At a Luxury Complex in India, the Maids and the Madams Go to War\n2017-07-15T17:48:37.000Z\nNOIDA, India \u2014 The madams in the luxury gated community went to yoga classes and toddler playgroups; the maids soundlessly whisked away dirty dishes and soiled laundry before retreating, at night, to a nearby shantytown of tin sheds and plastic tents.\nThis kind of arrangement has persisted across India for decades, in apparent harmony.\nBut early on Wednesday, at the Mahagun Moderne in Noida, on the outskirts of New Delhi, India\u2019s capital, the madams and the maids went to war.\nA dispute between a maid and her employer erupted into a full-blown riot, as hundreds of the maid\u2019s neighbors, armed with rocks and iron rods, forced their way into the complex and stormed her employer\u2019s apartment. In response, thousands of families have locked their maids out, saying they can no longer trust them in their homes.\nAshok Yadav, the development\u2019s head of security, wondered how long the madams could hold out.\n\u201cThe fact is that it is a symbiotic relationship between the madam and the maid,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, the residents are very angry and shocked at the violent way the mob attacked the society. But before long, they will have to find new maids. How will life go on otherwise?\u201d\nIndia\u2019s vast disparity between rich and poor means members of a newly moneyed class are able to hire domestic help for low pay, with no contracts and few legal obligations.\nThough they may resent their treatment, maids are typically afraid to lose their jobs, and of the \u201cpull their employers may have with the authorities,\u201d said Tripti Lahiri, the author of \u201cMaid in India: Stories of Inequality and Opportunity Inside Our Homes.\u201d\nConflicts between domestic workers and employers are a regular feature of Indian crime logs, but mass violence is almost unheard-of, Ms. Lahiri said. That is partly because in Indian cities, many maids live in their employers\u2019 homes, giving them little opportunity to build networks and compare notes.\nThat has changed, however, as luxury high-rises proliferated in farmlands on the outskirts of New Delhi, and slum neighborhoods appeared beside them, in what Ms. Lahiri called \u201ca perfect setup for an us vs. them clash.\u201d\nIn the case of Harshu Sethi and her maid, Johra Bibi, in Noida on Wednesday, the clash was Alfred Hitchcock-grade, awakening subterranean anxieties about the true relationship between the rich and the poor.\nOn Tuesday, Ms. Sethi accused Ms. Bibi of stealing 17,000 rupees, or about $265, from a safe in her apartment. She said Ms. Bibi had admitted taking 10,000 rupees in back wages, and then disappeared. Ms. Bibi, 30, denies confessing to anything, and said Ms. Sethi \u201ckept me locked at her place\u201d that night, an allegation that her husband shared with other residents of the slum. The police say the maid spent the night in the apartment of another employer.\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember anything,\u201d Ms. Bibi said in an interview. \u201cThe next morning there was a big ruckus. A lot of people came. The guard came and took me out.\u201d\nMs. Sethi, a schoolteacher, described something more frightening. She was in her apartment waking her 8-year-old son for school, she said, when she saw a \u201chuge crowd,\u201d led by women, coming toward her unit, shouting, \u201cToday we will kill her; we will kill the madam.\u201d\nVideo shows a loud, aggressive crowd surging toward the complex while security guards try ineffectually to beat it back. Ms. Sethi said people in the crowd jumped over the balcony of her ground-floor apartment and shattered a plate-glass door with a flower pot.\nMs. Sethi said she pulled her son from a glass-strewn bed and hid in the locked bathroom with her husband for an hour and a half, while the crowd ransacked her apartment.\n\u201cWe were only thinking of saving our lives,\u201d she said in an interview, sobbing, and displayed a heavy iron rod left in the apartment by one of the intruders. \u201cThey tried to show that they did not have rights. I feel that we do not have any human rights. We are the poor ones.\u201d\nMs. Sethi, 34, considers herself a benevolent boss.\n\u201cWe worship them, because they are such an important part of our lives,\u201d she said of the maids. \u201cHindus believe that if you are eating something and someone with an empty stomach is watching you eat, you cannot digest this food. We first feed them and then eat. I would give her tea before making her do her chores.\u201d\nBut she has, she said, lost her faith in that bond. \u201cI think they hate us,\u201d she said of the maids. \u201cThere is a definite class divide. They hate us for the money, they wonder: \u2018Why are they so well off, so rich? Why do they have everything?\u2019 They envy us, and this is how it comes out.\u201d\nMs. Bibi, the maid, had a different take on the relationship, saying Ms. Sethi had not paid her 3,500 rupees, or about $55, for the past two months, and had falsely accused her of stealing.\n\u201cJust because she has money, does she think she will get away with anything?\u201d she said. \u201cAll over, everyone is listening to her, and nobody to me. Will she throw us in the garbage just because I am poor?\u201d\nWithin hours, the conflict had drawn a bright line through the complex, which has 2,700 units, and the residents announced a decision to bar all servants from the complex. The Hindustan Times reported earnestly that \u201ca large number of families ordered their food from outside on Wednesday and Thursday.\u201d\n\u201cThe point is that they must be taught a lesson,\u201d said Mamta Pandey, 50. \u201cIf they can unite, why can\u2019t we?\u201d\nMs. Pandey said she now woke up an hour earlier to do chores, and was planning to buy \u201ca wiper which is made with new-age technology\u201d so she could more easily swab her floors. She said she \u201chad a problem sitting and wiping the floor the traditional way.\u201d\nSandhya Gupta, another neighbor, said employers should be careful not to let their guard down with their maids.\n\u201cThey are like that bone that is stuck in our throats \u2014 we can neither swallow them, nor can we spit them out,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need each other, and must learn to coexist with mutual respect.\u201d\nResidents of Ms. Bibi\u2019s shantytown said the week had been frightening and exhausting, and many said Ms. Bibi was at fault. The police swept into the settlement overnight on Wednesday and Thursday, detaining about 60 people and arresting 13 of her neighbors. Other residents fled into a field of okra and cowered there until the police left.\nOne of the workers, Sadanand, said the police were detaining men indiscriminately. Down the road, women from the Mahagun Moderne slipped outside the compound\u2019s gates to give resentful comments to the bank of news cameras outside.\nThe police said criminal complaints had been lodged by the Sethi family, Ms. Bibi, the residents of the complex and the security guards.\nArun Kumar Singh, Noida\u2019s superintendent of police, said it was striking how quickly the homeowners had turned on their employees, accusing them \u2014 falsely, he said \u2014 of being illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.\n\u201cI asked them a question: How did they then find shelter inside your house for all these years?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like this, the day we have a difference with our brother, that\u2019s the day our brother turns into a history-sheeter, a Naxalite,\u201d referring to ex-convicts and Maoist insurgents. \u201cOtherwise, before this, he is our brother.\u201d",

    "text": "Around the World in an Evening at the Queens Night Market\n2017-06-22T16:09:28.000Z\n\u201cThis is what you eat in La Paz at 4 a.m.,\u201d said the man half-devoured by smoke as he stood at the grill, stroking oil over beef hearts with a brush of banana husks.\nIt was only 8 p.m., but at the Queens Night Market, next to the undulating walls of the New York Hall of Science in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, the night already felt a little lawless, in the best sense of the word: emancipated from day and of unlimited promise.\nIn one hand, I clutched a newspaper printed in Bengali, whirled into a thonga, or cone, and brimming over with jhal muri: a loose bouquet of cilantro, puffed rice, crunchy filaments of fried chickpea flour and hoops of green chile like castoff earrings. Mustard oil trickled through. The heat clarified the soul.\nIn the other hand was a cup of chicha morada, a Peruvian drink of purple corn brewed with pineapple peels, cinnamon and cloves, and darker than any wine, so purple it was nearly black. The sweetness was a jolt, and then it was gone.\nA giant inflatable lucky cat, the talisman of storefronts all over Asia, waved its paw by the fence. Burnished ducks hung inside a stall, as if in a restaurant window in Chinatown. A crowd had gathered around a woman dripping molten sugar from a spoon onto a marble slab, letting it crystallize into the shapes of butterflies, bearded goats and koi with pursed lips, which children then toted around on sticks like lollipops.\nThere are other, more celebrated open-air food bazaars in town. But, for me, none is more surprising, thrilling and inspiring than the Queens Night Market. It runs Saturday nights from April to October (with brief breaks during the United States Open and Maker Faire), but in summer it has the most shimmer.\nAdvice for camp cooking, picnics and potlucks, along with recipes, cocktails, frozen desserts and a taste-test of the best supermarket hot dogs.\nI stood in line beside young mixed-race couples and first-generation sons and daughters bringing their immigrant parents out for the night. I consulted with strangers on what to try next: Ecuadorean bollos de pescado, tamale-like packets of stewed tuna inside a dough of mashed green plantains and peanut paste? Ersatz Twinkies frosted with Filipino ube (purple yam) or strewn with jackfruit and Fruity Pebbles? Balinese sate from the brilliantly named Endless Sunrice?\nThe market, which began in 2015, is a testament to both the cultural riches of Queens and the vision of its founder, John Wang, a former lawyer born in Texas to parents of Taiwanese descent. His goal is to showcase vendors \u201cfrom every country represented\u201d in New York City; the vendor application asks how each menu relates to the seller\u2019s heritage. Because the majority of vendors are first-time entrepreneurs, he offers free small-business seminars and recruits corporate sponsors to help lower their fees.\nCrucially for marketgoers, he has imposed a $5 price cap per dish (with a $6 exception for a few vendors whose margins are \u201crazor thin\u201d). This encourages smaller portion size and grazing, so I was able to try a dozen booths on each visit. I still mourned all that I had missed.\nSome pleasures I may never know again, like slippery sweet-potato noodles glossed with black vinegar and chile oil and betraying a throb of Sichuan peppercorn, from a stall whose sign sadly proclaimed, \u201cThis is our last week.\u201d (Please return next summer.)\nAmong the snacks and dishes to search and hope for is fuchka, delicate semolina shells lined with a mash of yellow peas and chile and sluiced with tamarind so they are sour-sweet and earthy-hot all at once. This is served under the banner of Jhal NYC, which is half food stall, half social enterprise. The two young men who run it \u2014 Queens-born and of Bangladeshi descent \u2014 hire recent immigrants and stay-at-home mothers to make the food, as a way of helping them gain footing in the city and a sense of independence.\nAt the Malaysian Project, the burger pays homage to the beloved Ramly chain in Kuala Lumpur. A compact patty of beef or chicken, suffused with a profoundly warm curry blend, is folded inside a yellow-white tie-dye of egg cracked right on the grill, then slid into a bun slaked with brown butter and chile mayo. I ate mine standing, in silence.\nBut I had to keep going, because I also wanted skewers of beautifully tender beef hearts from the smoky Bolivian Anticuchos booth, and Persian love cake from Sweet Zahra, a brief glissando of cardamom and rose water, already a memory even as I ate it.\nAt Joon, there is the crispy rice called tahdig in Farsi, molded into hollow cups to be filled with fesenjan, a stew whose brooding sweetness comes from long-simmered pomegranate juice. It was ladled in while the vendor\u2019s Iranian mother-in-law watched from the sidelines, approvingly.\nWhere else but Queens could you find \u201cNigerian bibimbap\u201d? (It\u2019s not fusion but marketing savvy.) At Obe, jollof rice is assembled in bibimbap style, with vegetables and meat on top: creamy efo (spinach stew), pepper chicken with gently insistent heat and plantains cooked just enough to sweat without turning too sweet.\nPaula\u2019s Seoul Food offers a light take on the original Korean bibimbap, with layers of quinoa and rice under pickled vegetables, bulgogi beef and a canopy of spinach leaves, as fresh and clean a version as I\u2019ve had in New York.\nAnd my favorite: kue pancong from Moon Man, Indonesian cakes of coconut and rice flour, typically made in grilling pans with crescent-shaped slots. Here they are full moons, hand-torched to order, the best decorated with no more than shreds of coconut and a dark stain of Java palm sugar. More novel toppings may include crumbled Oreos, advertised on the sign with a winking parenthetical: \u201c(Merica!)\u201d\nAt the end of each night, I found myself surrounded by people nibbling helixes of skewered potato slices; gawking as strips of dough were wrapped in spirals around fat metal cylinders to make kurtoskalacs, Transylvanian cakes traditionally roasted over a spit; and extolling the glories of moffles, waffles made with mochiko (glutinous rice flour). But by then I could eat no more.\nThe market\u2019s layout is thoughtful, with room to roam, an A.T.M. in a cloaked booth, picnic tables and portable sinks. Mr. Wang arrives at the park at 7 each Saturday morning to set up, and sometimes doesn\u2019t leave until 24 hours later. His staff members are almost entirely volunteers. They deserve applause.\nBeyond the fence is a beer and wine garden and a lawn where people roll around in knockerballs \u2014 plastic spheres that you can fit your body inside. More than a half-century ago, the park hosted the 1964 New York World\u2019s Fair, whose theme was \u201cPeace Through Understanding.\u201d The public swooned over rocket men in jet packs and dioramas of lunar colonies.\nBut what has perhaps lasted longest in our national memory is the Disney attraction first unveiled at the fair, a cruise by slow boat through caves thronged by dolls of almost every nation, chorusing as one. You know the song: \u201cIt\u2019s a small world after all.\u201d\nFollow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

    "text": "New York City, Alabama, Putin: Your Monday Evening Briefing\n2017-12-11T23:02:31.000Z\n(Want to get this briefing by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.)\nGood evening. Here\u2019s the latest.\n1. \u201cThe choice of New York is always for a reason, because we are a beacon to the world. And we actually show that a society of many faiths and many backgrounds can work.\u201d\nThat was Mayor Bill de Blasio on the attempted terrorist attack in New York City. The crudely made pipe bomb that exploded in a crowded subway corridor during the morning rush injured a handful of people, sent commuters fleeing into the streets and disrupted the day for tens of thousands more. The explosion was caught on surveillance video.\nOfficials rapidly identified the suspect as Akayed Ullah, a 27-year-old immigrant from Bangladesh living in Brooklyn. He told officials he was inspired by ISIS. He is in custody and has been hospitalized for burns.\n_____\n2. President Trump pushed back against an article that we published over the weekend, headlined \u201cInside Trump\u2019s Hour-by-Hour Battle for Self-Preservation.\u201d It was based on interviews with 60 advisers, associates, friends and members of Congress.\nIn particular, Mr. Trump insisted via Twitter that he does not watch four to eight hours of television each day. \u201cWe stand by our reporting,\u201d a Times spokeswoman responded.\nAnd the Treasury Department released an analysis of the Senate tax bill that suggested the $1.5 trillion plan would more than pay for itself \u2014 but only if the economy grows much faster than any independent analysis has projected.\n_____\n3. Alabama voters go to the polls tomorrow in what has become a national nail-biter: the special election for the Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\nRoy Moore, the arch-conservative Republican dogged by accusations that he made sexual advances on underage girls, is holding a rally with Stephen Bannon tonight. Doug Jones, his Democratic challenger, is getting a big assist from Democratic and liberal groups across the country.\nWe discussed the race with our political correspondent Jonathan Martin on \u201cThe Daily.\u201d\n_____\n4. President Vladimir Putin of Russia took a whirlwind diplomatic tour of Egypt, Syria and Turkey, amid anger over President Trump\u2019s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital.\nAbove, Mr. Putin, in car, waved goodbye to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. The trip showcased Mr. Putin\u2019s role as a global statesman just as he embarks on a campaign for another presidential term, his fifth and possibly last.\n_____\n5. When the Islamic State seized territory in Iraq and Syria in 2014, it had the time and space to manufacture weapons on an industrial scale. We obtained extensive documents that show how the group built up its output levels \u201cunlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen\u201d from a nonstate force.\nAt times the weapons were exceptionally cruel \u2014 booby-traps that blew up homes, heaters packed with explosives. Above, an area of Mosul recently recaptured from the group.\n\u201cThey\u2019re spreading this knowledge all over the world,\u201d said an explosives expert. \u201cIt\u2019s going to the Philippines, it\u2019s in Africa.\u201d He added, \u201cThis stuff\u2019s going to continue to grow.\u201d\n_____\n6. After reports that North Korea is developing the ability to launch submarine-based missiles, the U.S., Japan and South Korea are conducting drills to track such weapons.\nFears of a crisis on the Korean Peninsula are mounting. In China, a leaked document circulating online shows that a county along the border with North Korea is constructing refugee camps that could hold thousands of people.\n_____\n7. Mario Batali, the celebrity chef, apologized and stepped away from his food empire and ABC\u2019s \u201cThe Chew\u201d after four unnamed women accused him of sexual harassment.\nHe\u2019s one of the country\u2019s most high-profile chefs and restaurant owners, and also a best-selling cookbook author. The accusations were first reported by Eater, the food website.\nSeparately, The New Yorker fired its Washington correspondent, Ryan Lizza, after it said he had engaged in \u201cimproper sexual conduct.\u201d He denied the charge.\n_____\n8. Firefighters in Southern California have been getting some of the fires in Los Angeles and San Diego under control. But the Thomas Fire is still threatening communities around Santa Barbara. Above, a scene in Carpinteria.\nSign up for our California Today newsletter to get the latest on the fires and other local news delivered to your inbox each morning.\n_____\n9. Talk about unintended consequences. Among the transformations Nafta brought to Mexico: a diet more like the U.S.\u2019s, complete with lots of junk food, soda, meat \u2014 and an epidemic of diet-related illnesses. Above, a Sam\u2019s Club in Chiapas.\nThe latest installment of our series \u201cPlanet Fat\u201d tracks how the 1994 deal opened the floodgates to imports of cheap corn, meat and processed foods.\n\u201cThe only way that Mexico became a \u2018first world\u2019 country was in terms of diet,\u201d said a trade expert.\n_____\n10. Finally, the Golden Globes nominations are out, led by Guillermo del Toro\u2019s fantasy \u201cThe Shape of Water,\u201d with seven. Octavia Spencer, second left, and Sally Hawkins, center, both earned nominations for their roles in the film.\nHere are the top nominees and a look at the surprises and snubs (no best screenplay for \u201cGet Out\u201d; \u201cWonder Woman\u201d shut out; three nods for \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d \u2014 from which Kevin Spacey was eradicated).\nHave a great night.\n_____\nYour Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.\nAnd don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a.m. Sundays.\nWant to catch up on past briefings?

Trump and Melania Trump chose to have their first dance as president and first lady to \u201cMy Way.\u201d\nMr. Trump also opted to follow the spirit of the song on his first days on the job.\nThere were angry Twitter messages, complaints about crowd sizes at his swearing in ceremony and attempts to rewrite the history of his dealings with American intelligence agencies. The lack of discipline was troubling enough to concern even senior members of his circle.\nA combative team added to his pugilistic stance.\nMr. Trump declared himself to be in \u201ca running war with the media\u201d and his press secretary, Sean Spicer, used his first appearance on the White House podium to deliver a jeremiad against the news media. Kellyanne Conway, the president\u2019s counselor, then described falsehoods from Mr. Spicer, as \u201calternative facts,\u201d stoking even more debate.\nMs. Conway also said over the weekend that Mr. Trump had no intention of releasing his tax returns. But her argument that Mr. Trump has done everything he needs to do to step away from his businesses is unlikely to hold much water with critics.\nMr. Trump already faces a barrage of legal actions. A team of prominent constitutional scholars, Supreme Court litigators and former White House ethics lawyers intends to file a lawsuit on Monday, accusing Mr. Trump of violating the Constitution by allowing his hotels and other business operations to accept payments from foreign governments.\nAnd in his first executive order, President Trump directed government agencies to scale back as many aspects of the Affordable Care Act as possible. The move has raised questions about whether people with pre-existing conditions will be left without individual insurance.\nGalaxy Note 7 smartphones were heating up and, in some cases, catching fire because of manufacturing problems and design flaws in the battery. Samsung, which made the phones, apologized, saying that it would form an outside advisory group and add teams focused on the quality assurance of each core component of the device.\nKoh Dong-jin, president of Samsung\u2019s mobile communications business, said the lessons the company had learned had been integrated into its processes and culture, but offered no explanation of how that culture would change.\n\u201cAt a certain point in time you have to wonder just how much the brands and retailers will tolerate. They can tell the factories to drop these charges.\u201d\n\u2014 Scott Nova, the executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a labor rights group based in Washington that is among the most active nonprofits working in Bangladesh\u2019s garment industry. Labor rights groups say the government is trying to scare workers into silence by detaining innocent people.\nWith an eye on its initial public offering and amid concerns about fake news and disinformation, Snapchat has opted to take a hard line on misleading and explicit images.\nNew rules restrict publishers from posting questionable pictures on its Discover platform that do not have news or editorial value. Publishers are also prevented from including reports or links to outside websites that could be considered disinformation.\nThe rules could make the service more appealing to advertisers and investors hoping to avoid companies with taints of fake news and online abuse.\nSome have noted that Snapchat\u2019s approach to media is more akin to traditional media companies than other social media services, like Facebook and Twitter.\n\u201cThis is cable all over again, except for a mobile and global audience,\u201d said Steven Kydd, one of the founders of the online food publication Tastemade.\n\u2022 The retrial of two former executives at the defunct law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf begins on Monday with jury selection. A state judge declared a mistrial in an earlier criminal trial that stemmed from the collapse of the firm in 2012.",

    "text": "What to Read in the Face of Trauma\n2017-11-08T16:37:36.000Z\nMere days after the truck attack in Manhattan that killed eight people on Halloween, a man opened fire inside a church in Texas, killing 26 congregants. How do we reckon with these senseless acts of violence? In these three books, writers explore post-traumatic stress disorder and how others have healed after past national tragedies.\nTHE EVIL HOURSA Biography of Post-Traumatic Stress DisorderBy David J. Morris358 pp. An Eamon Dolan Book/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. (2015)\nIn this book, Morris, a former Marine who suffered from PTSD on his return from Iraq, traces the historical understanding of the disorder, of which, \u201clike many mental health disorders, there is a broad disagreement about what exactly PTSD is, who gets it and how best to treat it.\u201d Morris recounts stories of various types of survivors \u2014 of rape, war or near death experiences \u2014 and investigates the theories and treatments associated with healing from trauma, turning also to literature like \u201cThe Epic of Gilgamesh\u201d and Alice Sebold\u2019s \u201cThe Lovely Bones.\u201d Morris also mines his own experience of fighting in Iraq only to return home and find \u201ca lack of ritual and authentic public engagement\u201d with war or the trauma veterans experienced in its aftermath. Our reviewer wrote that reading \u201cThe Evil Hours\u201d will \u201cmake you a better and more humane citizen.\u201d\nMIDDLETOWN, AMERICAOne Town\u2019s Passage From Trauma to HopeBy Gail Sheehy412 pp. Random House. (2003)\nOf the almost 3,000 people who died on 9/11, nearly 50 were from the town of Middletown, N.J., losses which \u201cdevastated this place,\u201d in the words of a local music producer. This book follows Middletown residents as they grieve and try to move on after the deaths of their neighbors, spouses or family members. Sheehy describes the \u201crepetitive tortures\u201d those who lost loved ones contend with, like the mother who receives a call on Christmas about body parts found of her dead son. Sheehy spends much time on the widows and their different coping mechanisms: Anna Egan, for instance, moves to Connecticut for a fresh start, and four women join to form \u201cJust Four Moms From New Jersey,\u201d a group that works to document the United States\u2019 intelligence failures in the wake of 9/11. Ultimately, Sheehy finds that those who deal with the deaths head-on are able to move forward. \u201cMiddletown, America\u201d features some of the \u201cthousands of people in and around New York who are in pain every time they smell something burning,\u201d wrote our reviewer in 2003.\nTHE TRUE AMERICANMurder and Mercy in TexasBy Anand Giridharadas319 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. (2014)\nDays after 9/11, a Texan named Mark Stroman shot three men he suspected of being Muslims. Two \u2014 immigrants from India and Pakistan \u2014 died, but a third, Raisuddin Bhuiyan from Bangladesh, survived, and the book tells both his and Stroman\u2019s stories. Stroman shot Bhuiyan in a minimart, and as Bhuiyan lay covered in his own blood, he promised to \"dedicate my life for others\u201d if he survived. Surprisingly, it was Stroman whom he worked to save from death row. On his end, Stroman also underwent a change, finding a renewed sense of empathy in the face of potential death and the mercy of his victim. In telling both of these men\u2019s stories, Giridharadas complicates the question inherent in the book\u2019s title. And according to our reviewer, the fact that there is no simple answer to the question of which of the two men is a \u201ctrue American\u201d is \u201cGiridharadas\u2019s finest accomplishment.\u201d",

    "text": "Emmy Awards, London Underground, Hurricane Jose: Your Weekend Briefing\n2017-09-17T10:00:37.000Z\nHere are the week\u2019s top stories, and a look ahead.\n1. World leaders, who will gather in New York this week for the U.N. General Assembly, are facing no small number of international crises.\nJust days after the U.N. adopted new sanctions, North Korea fired a missile over Japan, its 15th such test this year. The North\u2019s threats are pushing Japan to consider an arms buildup and testing U.S. regional alliances.\nIn Southeast Asia, 400,000 Rohingya refugees have fled Myanmar for Bangladesh in recent weeks. More than half are children, and many are without their parents. Above, refugees making the trek.\nAnd President Trump\u2019s tweets about London\u2019s latest terrorist attack strained relations with Britain. He addresses the General Assembly on Tuesday.\n_____\n2. Russia has often been a focus at the General Assembly, and this year will be no different. Analysts fear its huge military exercises with Belarus could be a Trojan horse to establish bases at the borders of NATO nations. The drills end Wednesday.\nAnd more of the extreme methods Russia used to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election came to light. A Russian company with Kremlin ties spread vitriolic messages on divisive issues via hundreds of fake Facebook accounts, some of which used stolen photos to add authenticity, like those of a Brazilian salesman and his family, above.\nOur magazine examined how the Kremlin built one of the most powerful information weapons of the 21st century, and why it might be impossible to stop.\n_____\n3. The British police made what they said was a \u201csignificant arrest\u201d in the terrorist explosion in a London subway station last week that injured at least 30 people. A second man was arrested late Saturday.\nAbove, a masked British police officer entering a property being searched outside London.\n_____\n4. To the dismay of conservatives, President Trump and top Democratic leaders had a surprise meeting of the minds \u2014 creating a possible deal to pair legislation to protect young, undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers with enhanced border security, but setting aside the issue of the border wall.\nMr. Trump\u2019s management style is under scrutiny after accounts that he humiliated Attorney General Jeff Sessions in a meeting.\nAnd despite a dressing down on race relations from Tim Scott, the only black Republican senator, the president reiterated his stance that both sides were at fault for violence that erupted during a rally of white supremacists last month.\n_____\n5. Partisan tensions were also evident after Harvard announced it had invited Chelsea Manning, above, to be a visiting fellow, along with Sean Spicer and Corey Lewandowski, both former associates of President Trump.\nSharp, immediate blowback, including from the C.I.A. director, prompted Harvard to rescind the offer and apologize for \u201cnot recognizing upfront the full implications\u201d of appearing to endorse Ms. Manning, a former Army private convicted of leaking vast troves of classified information to WikiLeaks.\n_____\n6. The scope of hurricane damage grew clearer as Florida and the Gulf Coast made progress in cleaning up. But the horror of eight deaths at a sweltering Florida nursing home that had lost air-conditioning raised scrutiny of disaster planning. Everglades City, Fla., above.\nAnd a reporter who was dispatched to St. Martin, one of the Caribbean islands hit hardest by Irma, describes life without fuel, electricity, schools or a dependable food supply. See the damage on St. Martin, Anguilla and Barbuda, building by building.\nTropical Storm Maria is the latest threat to the Caribbean, while U.S. forecasters said people on the East Coast should keep an eye on Hurricane Jose.\n_____\n7. Cleanups are also in order in the business sector. Equifax took days to put together a cogent response to a breach that compromised the data of up to 143 million Americans \u2014 but don\u2019t hold your breath for more federal oversight.\nA lawsuit over claims of sexual harassment at the online lending start-up SoFi cost its C.E.O., Mike Cagney, his job. Another start-up, Upload, was able to quietly settle a lurid lawsuit (a \u201ckink room\u201d encouraged employees to have sex in the office), and go on with business as usual.\nAnd the former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli, who\u2019s awaiting sentencing on a fraud conviction, was jailed for offering $5,000 for a strand of Hillary Clinton\u2019s hair.\nIs there a Shkreli Syndrome? Researchers say that engaging in illicit behavior as a teenager may point to the success of entrepreneurs, and also foretell their undoing.\n_____\n8. Other difficulties facing women: Three former Google employees are suing, accusing the tech behemoth of paying women less than men.\nAnd, bafflingly, when Tokyo-based Nikon enlisted 32 photographers from Asia, Africa and the Middle East to promote a new camera, not a single one was a woman.\nChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the world\u2019s most powerful woman, is expected to be elected to a fourth term next Sunday. But even so, her country appears to have a woman problem.\n_____\n9.

    "text": "Where to Relax (and What to Eat) in Formentera\n2017-11-01T12:54:58.000Z\nThe southernmost Balearic Island, Formentera \u2014 a 12-mile-long, low-lying piney stretch that was abandoned because of the Black Plague in the 14th century and resettled only 300-odd years later \u2014 has long been known for its superlative beaches and water that\u2019s striped so many shades of blue it looks tie-dyed. Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix are said to have spent time on the island in the 1960s, and Pink Floyd visited in 1967. Today, glitter-painted tourists often day-trip from Ibiza, a 35-minute ferry ride away.\nBut until recently, there wasn\u2019t much else on Formentera to warrant extended stays. Now, though, the Spanish hotelier Pablo Carrington, who co-owns Torralbenc on Minorca and Cap Rocat on Majorca, has finished a redesign of Formentera\u2019s famed Gecko Hotel & Beach Club on Platja de Migjorn. Dining options have also improved dramatically, thanks to chefs who have migrated from Italy and the Spanish mainland to Formentera\u2019s whitewashed capital, Sant Francesc Xavier, and who skip the usual patatas bravas and chorizo to make inventive use of the island\u2019s seafood instead.\nFor all these changes, however, Formentera still isn\u2019t (and never will be) another Ibiza: It\u2019s dressed-down and low-key, with a soundtrack of breaking waves and chirping cicadas. The closest you\u2019ll get to nightclubbing is a beach bar with a D.J. and a sand floor, and the roads are more the purview of mopeds and Fiats than Italian supercars. And that, as a new generation of visitors in search of privacy and simple pleasures will tell you, is the whole point.\nGecko Hotel & Beach Club\nThis family-friendly resort, which opened in 2002, has been remade in midcentury style, with refined but comfortable furniture (spindle-legged armchairs and curtained daybeds by the hotel\u2019s designer, Antonio Obrador) and elaborate Moorish tiling, all in shades that echo the sand and sea, which is visible from just about everywhere on the property. Despite its sophisticated new look, the atmosphere at the 30-room hotel remains relaxed: In between complimentary yoga classes and sunset fish barbecues, guests lounge by their private plunge pools.\nTalaya\nSituated on a particularly tranquil slice of coast, Talaya is the island\u2019s unplugged option. Its two white adobe-style buildings, accented with cactuses and bougainvillea, house a collection of 14 simply furnished apartments. In lieu of a restaurant, there are individual kitchens, where guests can assemble picnics of fresh bread, citrus fruits, figs and goat cheese from the Sant Franscesc Xavier farmers\u2019 market (open every day except Sundays). Talaya doesn\u2019t have a pool, either, but who needs one when the glittering Mediterranean is only a 30-second stroll across the dunes?\nVilla Lentisco\nThe villa rental company Unique Properties & Events manages some of the island\u2019s most refined homes, including the brand-new, fully staffed Villa Lentisco, a series of Brutalist-style cubes overlooking Cala Saona beach. Designed by its Milanese architect owner, the villa has seven bedrooms, a large pool and an outdoor dining area. Inside, vintage Italian sofas and armchairs in muted tones of green and gray complement the polished concrete floors and scrubland surroundings.\nCan Carlitos\nHelmed by Nandu Jubany, who also has a Michelin-starred restaurant north of Barcelona, Can Carlitos serves the island\u2019s best tapas \u2014 try the scrambled eggs with potatoes and Iberian ham and the paella with pork ribs and scallops. Waiters bearing pitchers of strawberry and pineapple-infused sangria drift between the tables, which extend onto an open-air terrace set on a private, pebbly beach in La Savina.\nKiosko 62\nThis Platja de Migjorn beach shack is sleepy Formentera at its finest. There\u2019s reggae on the stereo and just a few tables, all shaded by a palm-frond awning and army netting that flutters in the breeze. A tiny kitchen turns out hamburgers and chicken skewers, along with cold beers and punchy gin-and-lemon cocktails. Patrons, meanwhile, get a view of the ombr\u00e9 shallows (and the barely clad swimmers enjoying them). Platja de Migjorn, west of Gecko Hotel & Beach Club.\n10.7\nA white rectangular box perched high above the striped umbrellas on the eastern end of Platja de Migjorn, this beach bar channels Ibiza-style glamour, with prices to match. The ceviche may not be fully authentic Spanish fare, but it\u2019s perfectly citrusy and piquant, and pairs well with icy ros\u00e9. After a long lunch and a dip in the sea below, diners often return for sunset cocktails.\nMolo47\nGiorgio Armani\u2019s former personal chef, the dashing Antonio D\u2019Angelo, opened this trendy restaurant, which, with its artful amuse-bouches (e.g. octopus tempura with jalape\u00f1o mayo) and graphic, braided-rope furniture by Kettal, wouldn\u2019t feel out of place in Manhattan. Standouts from the menu, which unites Italian and Japanese culinary techniques (D\u2019Angelo is also the executive chef at Nobu Milan), include Wagyu beef wrapped in paper-thin ravioli with caramelized onions, and a succulent, charcoal-smoked bonito with artichoke that arrives billowing steam. Diners can sit ringside at the chef\u2019s table, or choose a perch on the terrace and watch the yachts come and go.\nBalafia\nIn an airy space in Sant Francesc Xavier, this 12-year-old boutique stocks elegant, vacation-friendly clothes, accessories and furniture. Parisian textile designer Annie Barbaret and fellow French \u00e9migr\u00e9 Pascale Morel source them from small designers all over Europe, as well as from fair-trade enterprises in Rwanda and Bangladesh. Along with embroidered cotton tunics by Corsican label Mare di Latte, you\u2019ll find brightly patterned Wayuu bags, women\u2019s and children\u2019s swimsuits and woven hammam towels. 011-34-659-397-181.\nIemanya\nInstead of the biweekly hippie market at El Pilar de la Mola, which lately offers more key chains and tourist T-shirts than artisanal crafts, visit this boutique in Sant Francesc Xavier. Run by Claudia Rossi Liacho, an Argentine woman who arrived in Formentera in the early 1980s, the shop is draped to the rafters with maximalist tribal cotton and silk textiles and accessories from Rajasthan, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, featuring floral block prints and needlepoint beasts and birds in vibrant pinks, greens and blues. It\u2019s easy to lose hours happily rifling through the intricately embroidered and mirrored suzanis, camel blankets, caftans and colorful pompom bracelets. Avenida de Portossaler 13, Sant Francesc Xavier.",

    "text": "A Day in the Life of a Food Vendor\n2017-04-18T15:35:51.000Z\nIt\u2019s 6 on a Wednesday morning, and Kabir Ahmed has snoozed his alarm one too many times. He steps softly, barefoot, around his small, second-story apartment in Jamaica, Queens, creaking through the green and pink hall.\nHe is late, but careful not to wake his wife and their three children, or his mother, who will be up in an hour to say prayers and cook breakfast. He puts on his baseball hat, slides his feet into rubber clogs and hurries out without coffee.\nMr. Ahmed, 46, is in the business of chicken and rice. He immigrated from Bangladesh 23 years ago, and is now one of two partners in a halal food cart that sets up on Greenwich Street close to the World Trade Center, all year long, rain or shine. He is also one of more than 10,000 people, most of them immigrants, who make a living selling food on the city\u2019s sidewalks: pork tamales, hot dogs, rolled rice noodles, jerk chicken.\nThese vendors are a fixture of New York\u2019s streets and New Yorkers\u2019 routines, vital to the culture of the city. But day to day, they struggle to do business against a host of challenges: byzantine city codes and regulations on street vending, exorbitant fines for small violations (like setting up an inch too close to the curb) and the occasional rage of brick-and-mortar businesses or residents. Not to mention the weather, the whims of transit and foot traffic, and the trials of standing for hours, often alone, with no real shelter or private space.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s hard about this job?\u201d Mr. Ahmed says. \u201cEverything is hard. If I get old, I can\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d\nThe work is both demanding and routine. Mr. Ahmed commutes five or six days a week, clocking eight-hour shifts. His ride into Lower Manhattan is just over an hour, so if he can find a seat on the E train, he sleeps, squashed between the bodies of strangers, or watches part of a movie on his phone. Last week it was \u201cAsoka,\u201d based on the life of an Iron Age Indian ruler, played by one of his all-time favorite actors, Shah Rukh Khan.\nBut today, Mr. Ahmed checks his email first, hoping for news from one of the preschools processing the application of his youngest child, Karen. Nothing yet.\nBy 7:15 a.m., he has reached his usual spot, which he found three years ago by word of mouth: a wide swath of sidewalk in front of the BNY Mellon building that gets hectic around noon when those in the financial district crowd \u2014 a mix of Wall Street bankers and construction workers, students and tourists \u2014 are all looking to spend $5 or $6 on a fast, hot lunch.\nThough there are occasional turf wars among vendors, Mr. Ahmed has never had to fight for space. He buys breakfast \u2014 a coffee and doughnut \u2014 from a nearby vendor who gives him what Mr. Ahmed calls a \u201cneighbor discount.\u201d\n\u201cGood morning, neighbor!\u201d is his standard, sunny greeting for the half-dozen other carts on his block.\n\nLike many cart owners, Mr. Ahmed hires someone to deliver the cart to him every morning and return it to a garage each night. (Other owners hitch the carts to their cars and drive them in, then face the ordeal of finding a parking spot.)\nBut by 7:40, Mr. Ahmed is getting antsy; the driver is late. \u201cMaybe he has a flat tire,\u201d he says. He stays calm, though sometimes he can\u2019t help but imagine the worst. Mr. Ahmed was a New Yorker on 9/11, and this part of the city holds meaning for him. \u201cMany people, they went to work like me, they thought it was an ordinary day,\u201d he says.\nIt\u2019s cloudy and cold for April, and Mr. Ahmed is still sleepy, but he won\u2019t be tempted by the hot jolt of a second coffee. He knows he can\u2019t leave the cart to go to the bathroom (at the Target across the street, or the Whole Foods a few blocks away) until his partner shows up hours from now. Another coffee, this early in the day, would be way too risky.\nThe driver pulls up with Mr. Ahmed\u2019s cart at 7:52, and the two men work quickly to wheel it into place. Inside, the cart is cold, clean and packed with boxes of ingredients.\nThe food comes from a commissary kitchen attached to the garage in Long Island City, Queens; the city requires that food carts be serviced and supplied by a commissary, and there are many of them, of varying sizes, with different owners, all around New York.\nAt an extra cost, this one has provided everything Mr. Ahmed needs for the day: heads of lettuce, a few dozen tomatoes and potatoes, ready-sliced halal lamb, several bags of boneless chicken thighs, two 12-pound bags of basmati rice, four large plastic containers of potable water for cooking and washing, clamshell containers and napkins.\nMr. Ahmed ties on his apron and pushes a few boxes underneath the cart so he can squeeze inside and get to work. Any boxes peeking out beyond the cart\u2019s footprint could result in a fine (penalties can run up to $1,000), as could parking his cart closer than six inches to the curb, or 20 feet to the building entrance. Mr. Ahmed knows all the rules by heart.\nHe connects the 40-pound propane tank and turns on the flattop grill and burners. He cuts lettuce and tomatoes, browns lamb and vast amounts of chicken. He takes care, in the cramped kitchen space, to keep his vegetarian cooking separate. For a long time, Mr. Ahmed chops onions in silence.\n\u201cIf I play music or anything, I get distracted,\u201d he says. \u201cI forget the salt.\u201d\nAlthough Mr. Ahmed had little cooking experience when he started, his wife, Sheren Akter, says his food is better than that at most other carts \u2014 less greasy, more flavorful, well seasoned.\n\nHis menu consists of about 20 dishes, most of them cooked to order, but regulars know to ask for the chicken biryani, flecked with fried onion and cilantro, garnished with half a hard-boiled egg, all for $6, with a drink. He\u2019d like to raise the price, but worries that he would lose customers.\nTo make the biryani, Mr. Ahmed fries the onion until it\u2019s translucent. He drops in whole cinnamon, star anise, green cardamom pods and bay leaves. Before the chicken goes in, he adds garlic paste and a spoonful of ghee. He cooks the rice in the same simmering pot, adding water and a prepared spice mixture that includes dried papaya and plums. All the passers-by, those with travel mugs and employee ID badges, or those walking their dogs or pushing their strollers, inhale the familiar perfume of Mr. Ahmed\u2019s chicken biryani.\nSalman Akhtar, a pre-med student at Borough of Manhattan Community College, is Mr. Ahmed\u2019s first customer of the day, at 9:30. The men chat in Bangla, and when Mr. Ahmed speaks in Bangla, he is louder and faster, quicker to tell a joke.\nMr. Ahmed came to New York alone, at age 23. He had studied accounting and commerce at Dhaka College, but in Queens, it took him a few months to find a job. By then, he owed his roommates in Sunnyside almost $3,000.\nHe worked off the debt, busing tables and driving cars. But later, after Mr. Ahmed married and had children, he dreamed of a small business that he could expand.\nHe applied for a food vendor\u2019s license, took a required health and safety class, bought a used cart and took it for an inspection by city officials. (The health department inspects carts at least once a year, and more frequently if a violation is reported.)\nMr. Ahmed still needed a food-vending permit, though, and because of a cap on permits imposed in the 1980s, only 4,000 or so circulate. He acquired his from a permit owner who has charged him and his partner $25,000 for two-year leases (for a permit that cost the owner just $200), which they are still paying off.\nA day ago, Mr. Ahmed received a text message: 100 vendors were protesting the cap. Organized by the Street Vendor Project, a nonprofit group that is part of the Urban Justice Center and offers legal representation to city vendors, they hoped to pressure the City Council to pass legislation introduced last fall that would double the number of food-vending permits, gradually, over the next seven years. Mr. Ahmed, who believes the costs for those starting out should be more manageable, wanted to join them, but like many vendors, he couldn\u2019t get away from work.\n\u201cThe system is totally crazy,\u201d Mr. Ahmed says. \u201cWhoever has a license, give them a permit. It\u2019s good for all of us.\u201d\n\nOnce the lunch rush starts around 11:30, Mr. Ahmed can\u2019t budge from the cart. These hours blur together. He is no longer alone; by noon, he is joined by two more men in the 10-foot-long space \u2014 his partner and an assistant \u2014 working efficiently around the grill, fryer and steam table, finding their rhythm in the surges of orders as clusters of people appear.\nOne chicken biryani, no salad (a business administration student wearing earbuds and black velvet flats). Chicken and rice, hold the onions (an angry-looking man, cheeks flushed, in a wrinkled blue suit). Kati roll with veggies (a construction worker in dusty boots, whistling the theme song to \u201cFrasier\u201d).\nOn a good day, after paying the driver and the garage, and splitting the cash proceeds with his colleagues, Mr. Ahmed earns about $125. For a cart owner, that sum is not unusual.\nHe could make more, working longer hours alone, but he won\u2019t. Mr. Ahmed likes to tell the cautionary tale of a pushcart vendor who made the best food \u2014 so good he once netted $3,000 in one day. That vendor worked alone, and worked himself so hard, Mr. Ahmed says, that he got sick. Now he can\u2019t take care of anyone and has no one to take care of him.\nMr. Ahmed\u2019s son, Kowshik, who dreams of working for NASA, will be a high school senior in the fall, and Mr. Ahmed wants all his children to go to college. \u201cBut now I cannot get sick,\u201d Mr. Ahmed says, \u201cand I cannot stop working.\u201d\nAt 3:30 p.m., Mr. Ahmed\u2019s shift ends and he walks back to the subway; his partner will stay until the cart closes at 8.\n\nBy now, Mr. Ahmed\u2019s feet are sore and his back is aching. Lately, his back is always aching. The F train is delayed, but Mr. Ahmed, who likes to keep up on all the latest memes, and has been deprived of internet access for the duration of his shift, doesn\u2019t mind. He passes this time catching up on funny videos.\nThree times, he watches a 2015 clip of a 102-year-old woman who intends to blow out her birthday candles but instead sends her false teeth flying out onto the cake. People on the platform turn to stare as Mr. Ahmed belly-laughs, nearly weeping with delight. On the train, he learns that a preschool has accepted his daughter.\nBy 5, he is home, where he makes a few phone calls and takes a shower. Ms. Akter, who works part time as a cashier at a nearby Key Food, is also home. She makes a pot of coffee and warms up the food that Mr. Ahmed\u2019s mother cooked earlier: beef curry, potatoes in broth, shredded bitter melon saut\u00e9ed with onions, a cucumber and tomato salad, and two kinds of rice.\nIt\u2019s a feast, set up on the narrow table in the living room, where a soap opera plays on TV. As they catch up, Karen climbs onto the sofa to snuggle, and Ms. Akter fixes her hair.\nAfter work on Fridays, Mr. Ahmed goes to mosque, but not today. In just a few hours, it will be time to watch the news, turn in and start it all again.\nEvery year, they save money so Ms. Akter can take the children to visit relatives in Dhaka in the summer. But last week, she suggested that they plan a Caribbean cruise for the six of them instead. Mr. Ahmed didn\u2019t think they could afford that kind of vacation, not to mention so much time away from his cart.\nBut riding the E train today, peeling potatoes, changing out the empty propane tank, he\u2019d been thinking about it all the same. What would it be like to go on a cruise, he wondered. To board a big ship with your family, to vacation as they do in the movies, to fall asleep at night without setting an alarm.\nFollow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

    "text": "Puerto Rico, Tom Price, Catalonia: Your Weekend Briefing\n2017-10-01T10:00:23.000Z\nHere are the week\u2019s top stories, and a look ahead.\n1. \u201cA giant, beautiful, massive \u2014 the biggest ever in our country \u2014 tax cut.\u201d That\u2019s how President Trump described his new tax proposal, which would reduce corporate rates and collapse the individual brackets to three from seven. Here are six charts that help explain the plan.\nDemocrats say it offers little relief for the middle class and would mainly benefit corporations and the wealthy. Mr. Trump could save $1 billion. Some warn the deficit could explode.\nThe Senate Budget Committee unveiled a 2018 budget blueprint that would shield the tax cut \u2014 estimated at $1.5 trillion or more over the next decade \u2014 from a Democratic filibuster, a critical step for Republican lawmakers as they move ahead. First, the House and the Senate need to agree on a budget resolution for the 2018 fiscal year. The House is expected to vote on one this week.\n_____\n2. The White House is under escalating pressure to step up its response to the devastation in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria as food and water supplies dwindle and desperation and frustration grow among the island\u2019s 3.4 million residents.\nThe mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, has been a powerful voice of grievance. \u201cThis is not a good news story,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a \u2018people are dying\u2019 story.\u201d President Trump, from his New Jersey golf club, fired back, accusing her of \u201cpoor leadership.\u201d He said 10,000 federal workers were on the island \u201cdoing a fantastic job.\u201d\nA team of our journalists spent 24 hours with people trying to survive in the region. Here\u2019s what they saw.\nResidents of the U.S. Virgin Islands, which were also devastated by last month\u2019s hurricanes, are only beginning to understand the losses. President Trump plans to travel to Puerto Rico, and possibly the Virgin Islands, on Tuesday.\n_____\n3. Tom Price, above right, the health and human services secretary, has resigned after drawing ire from President Trump and the public for racking up at least $400,000 in travel bills for chartered flights. Don J. Wright, the deputy assistant secretary for health, will serve as acting secretary.\nThe president was dealt another blow when the evangelical favorite Roy Moore defeated Senator Luther Strange, Mr. Trump\u2019s pick, in the Senate G.O.P. runoff in Alabama.\nThe outcome reflects the power of the anti-establishment approach of Mr. Trump\u2019s recently departed chief strategist, Steve Bannon, and Mr. Bannon\u2019s new partnership with the billionaire Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah.\n_____\n4. Mitch McConnell, center, had also banked on Luther Strange, but the Senate majority leader\u2019s biggest defeat came when his party\u2019s last-ditch attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act imploded.\nPresident Trump, though, is not ready to fold, and predicted that the Senate would vote on another version early next year. He intends to negotiate with Democrats.\nWe looked at the long list of Mr. Trump\u2019s promises of rapid action, from health care to the wall with Mexico to an infrastructure bill. Most have not materialized.\n_____\n5. Reports of violence are piling up in Catalonia, Spain, as security forces try to stop an independence referendum vote unfolding in defiance of Madrid. Here are images from the voting and the days leading up to it.\nCatalonia\u2019s \u201caccidental\u201d leader, Carles Puigdemont, accused the central government of using \u201ctruncheons against ballot boxes.\u201d Here\u2019s what\u2019s at stake.\n_____\n6. In the wake of another independence vote \u2014 an overwhelming yes from Iraqi Kurds \u2014 the government in Baghdad is attempting to isolate the Kurdish region by land and air. But cooperation between Kurds and the Iraqi military is still vital in the fight against the Islamic State, with thousands of Iraqis fleeing to the safety of Kurdish areas over the weekend as the government mounts an offensive.\nThe Kurds warned they would declare independence unilaterally if Baghdad did not yield. Does their dream of independence have a chance?\n_____\n7. More than half a million Rohingya Muslims fled Myanmar for Bangladesh in September, topping the worst month of the Syrian refugee outflow, and the recent arrivals are living in abjectly desperate conditions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s on a scale that we couldn\u2019t imagine,\u201d said a medical emergency manager.\nHere\u2019s how you can help.\n_____\n8. The United States is in direct contact with North Korea, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson confirmed, offering a possible way forward beyond threats of military confrontation.\nPresident Trump is expected to travel to five Asian nations over 12 days in November, including three critical to the North Korea crisis: Japan, South Korea and China. Above, North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un.\nOtto Warmbier \u2014 the college student who was imprisoned in North Korea and died shortly after he was returned to the U.S. in a coma \u2014 suffered brain damage after his blood circulation was cut off, a coroner concluded. Mr. Warmbier\u2019s parents and Mr. Trump claim that he was tortured. The coroner saw no signs of torture but couldn\u2019t rule out the possibility.\n_____\n9. Facebook isn\u2019t the only social media platform under scrutiny for enabling Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Twitter faced the Senate and House intelligence committees and was accused of ignoring fraudulent Russian activity after it reported only 200 fake accounts. Google is also preparing to brief Congress.\nThe Congressional Black Caucus raised the heat on Facebook to examine Russian efforts to exploit racial division ahead of the election.\n_____\n10. Economists hunting for causes of stagnating wages found part of the answer buried in fast-food franchise agreements.\nSome of the industry\u2019s biggest names, including Burger King, Carl\u2019s Jr. and Pizza Hut, prohibit franchisees from hiring workers away from one another.\nThe current state of U.S. wages will come out in the monthly employment report due Friday.\n_____\n11. Today is game day for the N.F.L., with the possibility of more anthem protests. After havoc last week, the N.F.L. found itself in a tight spot, trying to balance its players\u2019 desire to raise social issues with fans who want to enjoy the sport without a political tinge. Here\u2019s the roster of games.\nOne theme that emerged from several meetings across the league: Don\u2019t push back at an unpredictable president.\nAt some high schools, students who kneel during the anthem could face punishment. But if the school is public, such directives may run up against students\u2019 First Amendment rights.\n_____\n12. \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d had a lot of news to catch up on in its season premiere, including the anthem protests and President Trump\u2019s response to the hurricane devastation in Puerto Rico.\n\u201cWrite them a check with our money, you cheap cracker,\u201d the cast member Michael Che, above, said in a searing mini-monologue on \u201cWeekend Update.\u201d\nJay-Z, the musical guest, performed his first song in a Colin Kaepernick jersey.\n_____\n13. Finally, it\u2019s October, the perfect time of year to take in a scary movie or two, especially in the comfort of your home. Here are some of our top picks.\nNeed something to nibble on while you\u2019re at it? How about these internet-famous chocolate chip cookies. Be ready to \u201cpan-bang,\u201d though, if you want the crisp ripples.\nHave a great week.\n_____\nYour Weekend Briefing is published Sundays at 6 a.m. Eastern.\nAnd don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing, weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Evening Briefing, weeknights at 6 p.m. Eastern.\nWant to look back?

    "text": "Ben & Jerry\u2019s Strikes Deal to Improve Migrant Dairy Workers\u2019 Conditions\n2017-10-03T16:32:18.000Z\nFor years, Ben & Jerry\u2019s took steps to make sure that its ice cream did not contain artificial growth hormone. The company also has a self-imposed fee on its greenhouse gas emissions.\nWhat Ben & Jerry\u2019s did not have was a reliable way of ensuring that the dairy farms supplying it with milk were providing humane conditions for their workers, a major issue in an industry where many people work seven days a week for less than minimum wage.\nOn Tuesday, the ice cream maker, which is based in Vermont, took a big step toward changing that, signing an agreement with a farmworkers\u2019 group that establishes labor standards for the company\u2019s suppliers in the state, and creates an enforcement strategy that encourages workers to speak up about violations.\n\u201cWe love to be part of innovation,\u201d said Jostein Solheim, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe believe in worker-led movements, and in bringing in dairy and doing it in Vermont.\u201d\nThe agreement borrows heavily from an arrangement called the Fair Food Program that was put in place in 2011 to address troubling conditions in Florida\u2019s tomato industry.\nIn that instance, Subway, Walmart, Whole Foods and other companies committed to paying an extra 1 to 4 cents per pound of tomatoes and to buying only from participating suppliers. The suppliers, in turn, agreed to pay the legal minimum wage and to ensure workers\u2019 rights and safety. The program has been widely credited with improving working conditions in an industry where human trafficking flourished until recently. It has expanded to other crops and other states on the East Coast.\nThe 1,200 to 1,500 workers in Vermont\u2019s dairy industry have been laboring under their own grim circumstances.\nA 2014 survey of about 170 dairy workers in the state by Migrant Justice, the farmworkers\u2019 advocacy group that signed the agreement with Ben & Jerry\u2019s, found that in addition to a scarcity of days off, workers had schedules that frequently kept them from sleeping more than a few hours at a time. Many of the migrants, who typically work year round for low wages and live on the farms that employ them, also had substandard housing.\n\u201cOne of the biggest issues was housing conditions, the need for workers to be provided with basic amenities, like electricity, water, and housing that is free from pest infestations,\u201d said Enrique Balcazar, a former dairy worker who has helped lead the organizing effort, speaking through a translator.\nThe workers tend to be undocumented, making it difficult for them to speak out.\nUnder the program, called Milk With Dignity, workers at dairy farms that supply Ben & Jerry\u2019s will have the right to one day off a week and will earn at least the state minimum wage, currently $10 an hour. Workers will also be guaranteed at least eight consecutive hours of rest between shifts and housing accommodations that include a bed and access to electricity and clean running water.\nThe agreement requires Ben & Jerry\u2019s to acquire its milk from farms that adhere to the standards. It will be enforced in part by the affected workers, who will be informed of their rights and encouraged to report violations to a 24-hour hotline.\nCompliance will be monitored by a group led by a former staff lawyer at the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Immigrant Justice Project, which will conduct audits. Ben & Jerry\u2019s will effectively finance the benefits by paying an undisclosed premium on the milk it buys, based on volume.\nBrendan O\u2019Neill, an organizer with Migrant Justice, praised the company.\n\u201cBy signing this agreement, Ben & Jerry\u2019s is prioritizing dairy workers as the most important ingredient in their ice cream,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neill said.\nBen & Jerry\u2019s has been owned by the consumer goods giant Unilever since 2000, but it has retained its founders\u2019 interest in social and environmental activism. The company said it had long had labor standards in place for its suppliers and that the most egregious abuses of workers did not occur on its suppliers\u2019 farms. But it acknowledged that enforcing the standards had been challenging.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see a huge gap in hard-core standards,\u201d Mr. Solheim said, \u201cbut we see an opportunity to make it work better.\u201d\nMigrant Justice began its campaign to improve conditions for immigrant farm workers in Vermont several years ago, not long after a worker died after getting tangled in a piece of machinery and being strangled by his own clothes.\nThe group\u2019s efforts got a lift in June 2015, when Ben & Jerry\u2019s formally agreed in principle to support the Milk With Dignity program. But negotiating the details of the agreement, which affects nearly 90 farms that typically employ up to 10 workers apiece, proved to be complicated.\n\u201cThese are real family businesses,\u201d Mr. Solheim said, describing what he saw as a big distinction between the agricultural industries in Vermont and Florida. \u201cIt\u2019s a different dynamic than what we have in a big produce area, where hundreds of people show up to harvest.\u201d\nMigrant Justice took several actions, including protests and marches, to put pressure on Ben & Jerry\u2019s over the past two years, and the group had scheduled a national day of action for Thursday. (Ben & Jerry\u2019s said it understood the group\u2019s tactics but noted that it had never stopped negotiating.)\nThe program will be adopted in stages, with some standards, like prohibitions on sexual assault, forced labor and violence toward workers, taking effect immediately. Others, like raising pay to the minimum wage, will come more gradually. Farms must first go through an orientation, and workers must complete education sessions before Ben & Jerry\u2019s begins making the larger payments that will finance some of the benefits.\nSome experts, while crediting the Fair Food Program\u2019s achievements, have said they were skeptical about whether the model could be extended to a substantial portion of the country\u2019s farm workers, many of whom experience some of the worst conditions and lowest pay in the American work force. (Estimates for how many farm workers there are in the country run from under one million to a few million. Such workers are not covered by the federal minimum wage law, or by similar laws in most states.)\nGreg Asbed, a founder of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, which pushed for the Florida program, said the agreement involving Ben & Jerry\u2019s \u2014 and similar accords in other industries, like those geared toward improving safety conditions for garment workers in Bangladesh \u2014 showed that the model could be applied widely.\nThe only necessary conditions, he said, were the buying power of major brands, which exert enormous leverage over suppliers, and worker participation, to define the needed rights and to help ensure compliance.\nMargaret Gray, an associate professor of political science at Adelphi University who has studied farm labor conditions, praised both the Fair Food Program and the Ben & Jerry\u2019s arrangement. But she warned that one force that made such programs effective, the power of corporate giants, could make it hard to extend their reach.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the corporations who tend to be making the most money, doing so at the expense of the workers, and at the expense of a lot of farmers,\u201d she said. They excel at \u201cfostering division between the two.\u201d",

    "text": "\u2018She Hasn\u2019t Ruined Your Art, She Has Made It Relevant\u2019\n2017-04-15T09:00:04.000Z\nHere are the top 10 comments of the week on our digital platforms, as selected by our readers and the journalists who moderate nearly every comment. Some comments were edited for length and clarity.\n1. As an artist, I love Fearless Girl. But as an intellectual property lawyer, I will say that Mr. Da Modica has a valid legal argument.\nFearless Girl is a work of art that incorporates Charging Bull without permission of the copyright owner. Unauthorized use of a copyrighted work \u2014 unless it falls within some narrow exceptions \u2014 is straight up copyright infringement.\nIn my opinion, Mr. Da Modica is absolutely correct that Fearless Girl completely changes his sculpture\u2019s meaning. You can\u2019t control how people view your copyrighted work necessarily, but you can certainly prohibit them from using it without authorization. The relevant factual question would be, does Fearless Girl use the bull sculpture.\nFearless Girl is great, but people are unfairly attacking Mr. Da Modica. He could have easily and justifiably simply filed what would be a very strong claim for infringement \u2014 but he hasn\u2019t. He\u2019s trying to work things out. THAT is a rare find, indeed.\n\u2014 Leonard H in Winchester, reacting to an article about Arturo Di Modica, who created the \u201cCharging Bull\u201d sculpture that stands near Wall Street and is demanding that the \u201cFearless Girl\u201d statue be moved to another location.\n2. Artists don\u2019t get to force their interpretation of their art on others. All they can do is create and hope their message gets across. That bull may have been a symbol of hope for a better future but is now a symbol of greed and economic tyranny. That little girl doesn\u2019t just represent women, it represents every person that is willing to stand up to the rich and powerful. She hasn\u2019t ruined your art, she has made it relevant.\n\u2014 Not my full name in Illinois.\nThis comment received 527 reader recommendations.\n3. I was on a United flight from London to Los Angeles some years ago. As a physician, I answered a call to assist in the care of a pregnant woman who had stopped having fetal movements and was not feeling well. My fear was that she would spontaneously abort mid-flight and I would have to deliver a dead baby on board.\nI sat with her for several hours on the floor of the galley until she was stabilized. 2 weeks after arrival I received a letter from the United Flight Surgeon thanking me for my \u201cservice\u201d during that stressful flight. Accompanying his letter was a certificate for $25 off my next ticket on United Airlines. I tore up the letter and the certificate.\nI am not surprised by the actions the airline and security personnel took in this unfortunate case nor am I surprised at the airline\u2019s explanation of the incident. Assault and Battery should not be a method of bumping innocent passengers who put their lives in your hand to get them safely from place to place.\n\u2014 DKMD in Santa Monica, Calif., reacting to an article about United Airlines overbooking a flight and forcibly removing a passenger off the plane.\n4. The man was disorderly and refusing to obey airline staff and police instructions. What were the cops supposed to do? Meekly tell him to have a nice day and walk off the plane? When the police are called in most cases like this they take some kind of action. This gentleman bears the responsibility for how this scene played out.\n\u2014 Tornadoxy in Ohio. \n5. Friendly fire is a common occurrence in any military conflict. Intelligence is never perfect, and commanders and their soldiers would never want to put their own at risk. Sometimes someone doesn\u2019t follow proper procedures and needs to be punished. Other times it is just unavoidable. But it\u2019s crazy to put the blame on Trump. Is he really supposed to make a decision about every airstrike in Syria? How could he possibly be sufficiently informed about the operational situation at any one place and time in Syria?\n\u2014 Felix Sonderkammer in Boca Raton, Fla., responding to an article about an airstrike that killed 18 Syrian flighters allied with the United States.\n6. We seem to be very good at killing allied fighters and innocent civilians, thereby dishonoring our country and reinforcing anti-Americanism worldwide. Why is there not strict oversight to prevent these acts of stupidity?\n\u2014 Sylvia in New York.\n7. Give that man a Pepsi and a free flight on United. He\u2019s earned it.\n\u2014 Richard Chapkis on The Times\u2019 Facebook page, reacting to a video in which Sean Spicer compared Hitler to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.\nThis comment received over 6,000 likes.\n8. My doctorate is in the treatment of pesticide poisoning. Sarin gas was invented by Nazi scientists in the 1930\u2019s as a potential insecticide. It was found to be so lethal that it could not even be touched without inflicting a horrifying death. It was then researched to replace hydrogen cyanide gas to be a more efficient murdering tool in the death camps.\nWWll ended before sarin could be utilized in that war. For the record most of the more potent organophosphate insecticides (sarin is an organophosphate insecticide) have been banned in the U.S. The irony here is that Spicer says Nazis never used sarin poison gas on its citizens, when in fact they invented it. Given a few more months sarin could have been used in combat or to murder innocents.\n\u2014 Kimball Chatfield in Lake Tahoe, Calif.\nThis comment received 1,595 reader recommendations.\n9. This article does a nice job spotlighting several communities that make London an interesting place, but breezes over the troubling aspects of globalization that impact the city. London\u2019s global nature isn\u2019t all Indian food and Bangladeshi\u2019s trying for a better life. Its the international banking class pricing out longtime residents from neighborhoods like Camden and Shoreditch. Its Eastern European Oligarchs laundering their money with Chelsea real estate. Its vast neighborhoods of empty houses owned by Saudi princes while people struggle to find housing.\nTrue, globalization brought \u201cothers\u201d to London, and that makes some in the rest of England resent London, but globalization also brought an increased class divide between the capital and the rest of the country that also explains a lot.\nI would have liked to see Britain remain in the EU, but I think The Times could have done a better job highlighting the points of view many hold on the negative effects that globalization has on the fabrics of cities like London.\n\u2014 Chuck Choi in Boston, Mass., reacting to an article about the future of London as an international crossroad.\n10. I\u2019m English. Born and bred. What is the definition of Englishness?\nLondon has always been the heart of immigrant UK. The East End was home to migrant East European jews in the 19th century, of Germans earlier in the century. Look at the surnames of Londoners compared to those in the shires.\nWhy has diversity suddenly become an issue?\n\u2014 Nigel in Amsterdam.",

    "text": "Closing Manus Island Center Would Hurt Refugees, Australia Is Told\n2017-10-25T13:29:54.000Z\nSYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Australia and Papua New Guinea have failed to protect hundreds of asylum seekers sent to Manus Island under Australia\u2019s contentious offshore processing policy, and threats to their safety and health will increase if Australia closes the island\u2019s main detention center next week as planned, Human Rights Watch said on Thursday.\nIn a report based on interviews with 40 of the 770 refugees and asylum seekers on Manus, which is part of Papua New Guinea, Human Rights Watch investigators said that several had been assaulted or robbed by local young men, who in some cases were drunk and armed with knives or screwdrivers.\nAt least three victims since June required emergency medical attention in Papua New Guinea\u2019s capital, Port Moresby, or in Australia, according to the report, which said that in most of the cases no one was charged or punished.\n\u201cThere has been an escalation in violence in the last six months and there has been little to no action by police,\u201d Elaine Pearson, the Australia director at Human Rights Watch, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s simply not safe to move them out of the facility.\u201d\nThe report, which includes video interviews with refugees from a trip to Manus in September, was released days before the planned closing on Tuesday of the main processing center on Manus, and as debate about the costs and risks of Australia\u2019s refusal to accept asylum seekers who try to arrive by boat continues to flare.\nIn Parliament this week, Australian immigration officials told lawmakers that 606 people at the main center in Manus were refusing to move out by the Tuesday deadline. Senator Nick McKim of the Greens party said the government\u2019s plan to cut off food, water and power after the deadline was an attempt to \u201cstarve out\u201d the remaining asylum seekers, all of whom are men.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re risking a human rights disaster here and potentially a mass loss of life?\u201d he asked.\nAustralian officials have said they would continue to provide services to asylum seekers who stay on Manus, including housing and food. They estimated that it would cost 150 million to 250 million Australian dollars, or $115 million to $193 million, to do so for 12 months, depending on the terms of contracts with suppliers and how many asylum seekers find a way to leave the island.\nMs. Pearson said she was uncertain what such a large pool of money would pay for, but she said the asylum seekers\u2019 safety would be difficult to ensure unless Australia made it more of a priority.\n\u201cAustralia is walking away and leaving the P.N.G. government in charge, so when things go wrong, then P.N.G. will get the blame,\u201d Ms. Pearson said, referring to Papua New Guinea. \u201cBut paying the P.N.G. government to take over operations on Manus doesn\u2019t absolve Australia of its responsibilities to these men.\u201d\nManus is one of two offshore centers where hundreds of refugees and asylum seekers from Iran, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and several other countries have been housed for roughly four years, since being detained at sea while trying to reach Australia. The other center is on Nauru, a tiny island nation that is even more remote than Manus.\nSupporters of Australia\u2019s refusal to accept seaborne asylum seekers argue that it has significantly reduced the maritime trafficking of migrants in crowded, rickety boats, which has often led to deaths at sea. But the United Nations and several human rights groups have repeatedly criticized Australia for the harshness of its approach.\nThe Australian government has been trying for years to get other countries to accept the refugees. Officials say the Manus center is being closed because of a ruling last year by Papua New Guinea\u2019s Supreme Court, which determined that the detention of refugees and asylum seekers there was \u201cillegal and unconstitutional.\u201d\nThe United States had agreed to consider taking some of the refugees, under a deal reached near the end of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. President Trump called the agreement \u201cdumb\u201d soon after taking office. So far, only about 50 refugees have been relocated to the United States after extensive screening, about half of them from Manus and half from Nauru, according to Human Rights Watch.\nWith the Manus center\u2019s closing looming, Australian immigration officials have been seeking alternatives. The government recently offered refugees on Manus a chance to move to Nauru, for example, while they wait to hear whether the United States will accept them. But only two refugees have expressed an interest in going.\nHuman Rights Watch investigators said that many of those on Manus were suffering from trauma, not just from experiences in their home countries but as a result of their detention, during which fellow asylum seekers have killed themselves or been beaten or killed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe the situation could get worse, but the proposed shutdown of the main facility would expose the refugees and asylum seekers to even greater harm,\u201d Ms. Pearson said.",

    "text": "As Donald Trump Denies Climate Change, These Kids Die of It\n2017-01-06T15:30:29.000Z\nTSIHOMBE, Madagascar \u2014 She is just a frightened mom, worrying if her son will survive, and certainly not fretting about American politics \u2014 for she has never heard of either President Obama or Donald Trump.\nWhat about America itself? Ranomasy, who lives in an isolated village on this island of Madagascar off southern Africa, shakes her head. It doesn\u2019t ring any bells.\nYet we Americans may be inadvertently killing her infant son. Climate change, disproportionately caused by carbon emissions from America, seems to be behind a severe drought that has led crops to wilt across seven countries in southern Africa. The result is acute malnutrition for 1.3 million children in the region, the United Nations says.\nTrump has repeatedly mocked climate change, once even calling it a hoax fabricated by China. But climate change here is as tangible as its victims. Trump should come and feel these children\u2019s ribs and watch them struggle for life. It\u2019s true that the links between our carbon emissions and any particular drought are convoluted, but over all, climate change is as palpable as a wizened, glassy-eyed child dying of starvation. Like Ranomasy\u2019s 18-month-old son, Tsapasoa.\nSouthern Africa\u2019s drought and food crisis have gone largely unnoticed around the world. The situation has been particularly severe in Madagascar, a lovely island nation known for deserted sandy beaches and playful long-tailed primates called lemurs.\nBut the southern part of the island doesn\u2019t look anything like the animated movie \u201cMadagascar\u201d: Families are slowly starving because rains and crops have failed for the last few years. They are reduced to eating cactus and even rocks or ashes. The United Nations estimates that nearly one million people in Madagascar alone need emergency food assistance.\nI met Ranomasy at an emergency feeding station run by Catholic nuns who were trying to save her baby. Ranomasy had carried Tsapasoa 12 hours on a trek through the desert to get to the nuns, walking barefoot because most villagers have already sold everything from shoes to spoons to survive.\n\u201cI feel so powerless as a mother, because I know how much I love my child,\u201d she said. \u201cBut whatever I do just doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\nThe drought is also severe in Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe, and a related drought has devastated East Africa and the Horn of Africa and is expected to continue this year. The U.N. World Food Program has urgently appealed for assistance, but only half the money needed has been donated.\nThe immediate cause of the droughts was an extremely warm El Ni\u00f1o event, which came on top of a larger drying trend in the last few decades in parts of Africa. New research, just published in the bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, concludes that human-caused climate change exacerbated El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s intensity and significantly reduced rainfall in parts of Ethiopia and southern Africa.\nThe researchers calculated that human contributions to global warming reduced water runoff in southern Africa by 48 percent and concluded that these human contributions \u201chave contributed to substantial food crises.\u201d\nAs an American, I\u2019m proud to see U.S. assistance saving lives here. If it weren\u2019t for U.S.A.I.D., the American aid agency, and nonprofit groups like Catholic Relief Services that work in these villages, far more cadavers would be piling up. But my pride is mixed with guilt: The United States single-handedly accounts for more than one-quarter of the world\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions over the last 150 years, more than twice as much as any other country.\nThe basic injustice is that we rich countries produced the carbon that is devastating impoverished people from Madagascar to Bangladesh. In America, climate change costs families beach homes; in poor countries, parents lose their children.\nIn one Madagascar hamlet I visited, villagers used to get water from a well a three-hour walk away, but then it went dry. Now they hike the three hours and then buy water from a man who trucks it in. But they have almost no money. Not one of the children in the village has ever had a bath.\nFamilies in this region traditionally raised cattle, but many have sold their herds to buy food to survive. Selling pressure has sent the price of a cow tumbling from $300 to less than $100.\nFamilies are also pulling their children out of school, to send them foraging for edible plants. In one village I visited, fewer than 15 percent of the children are attending primary school this year.\nOne of the children who dropped out is Fombasoa, who should be in the third grade but now spends her days scouring the desert for a wild red cactus fruit. Fombasoa\u2019s family is also ready to marry her off, even though she is just 10, because then her husband would be responsible for feeding her.\n\u201cIf I can find her a husband, I would marry her,\u201d said her father, Sonjona, who, like many villagers, has just one name. \u201cBut these days there is no man who wants her\u201d \u2014 because no one can afford the bride price of about $32.\nSonjona realizes that it is wrong to marry off a 10-year-old, but he also knows it is wrong to see his daughter starve. \u201cI feel despair,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel a man any more. I used to have muscles; now I have only bones. I feel guilty, because my job was to care for my children, and now they have only red cactus fruit.\u201d\nOther families showed me how they pick rocks of chalk from the ground, break them into dust and cook the dust into soup. \u201cIt fills our stomachs at least,\u201d explained Limbiaza, a 20-year-old woman in one remote village. As it becomes more difficult to find the chalk rocks, some families make soup from ashes from old cooking fires.\nScientists used to think that the horror of starvation was principally the dying children. Now they understand there is a far broader toll: When children in utero and in the first few years of life are malnourished, their brains don\u2019t develop properly. As a result, they may suffer permanently impaired brain function.\n\u201cIf children are stunted and do not receive the nutrition and attention in these first 1,000 days, it is very difficult to catch back up,\u201d noted Joshua Poole, the Madagascar director of Catholic Relief Services. \u201cNutritional neglect during this critical period prevents children from reaching their full mental potential.\u201d\nFor the next half century or so, we will see students learning less in school and economies held back, because in 2017 we allowed more than a million kids to be malnourished just here in southern Africa, collateral damage from our carbon-intensive way of life.\nThe struggling people of Madagascar are caught between their own corrupt, ineffective government, which denies the scale of the crisis, and overseas governments that don\u2019t want to curb carbon emissions.\nWhatever we do to limit the growth of carbon, climate problems will worsen for decades to come. Those of us in the rich world who have emitted most of the carbon bear a special responsibility to help people like these Madagascar villagers who are simultaneously least responsible for climate change and most vulnerable to it.\nThe challenges are not hopeless, and I saw programs here that worked. The World Food Program runs school feeding programs that use local volunteers and, at a cost of 25 cents per child per day, give children a free daily meal that staves off starvation and creates an incentive to keep children in school.\nWe need these emergency relief efforts \u2014 and constant vigilance to intervene early to avert famines \u2014 but we can also do far more to help local people help themselves.\nCatholic Relief Services provides emergency food aid, but it also promotes drought-resistant seed varieties and is showing farmers near the coast how to fish. It is also working with American scientists on new technologies to supply water in Madagascar, using condensation or small-scale desalination.\nAmerican technology helped create the problem, and it would be nice to see American technology used more aggressively to mitigate the burden on the victims.\nFor me, the most wrenching sight of this trip was of two starving boys near the southern tip of Madagascar. Their parents are climate refugees who fled their village to try to find a way to survive, leaving the boys in the care of an aunt, even though she doesn\u2019t have enough food for her own two daughters.\nI met the boys, Fokondraza, 5, and Voriavy, 3, in the evening, and they said that so far that day they hadn\u2019t eaten or drunk anything (the closest well, producing somewhat salty water, is several hours away by foot, and fetching a pail of water becomes more burdensome when everyone is malnourished and anemic). Their aunt, Fideline, began to prepare the day\u2019s meal.\nShe broke off cactus pads, scraped off the thorns and boiled them briefly, and the boys ate them \u2014 even though they provide little nutrition. \u201cMy heart is breaking because I have nothing to give them,\u201d Fideline said. \u201cI have no choice.\u201d\nAt night, the boys sometimes cry from hunger, she said. But that is a good sign. When a person is near starvation, the body shuts down emotion, becoming zombielike as every calorie goes to keeping the heart and lungs working. It is the children who don\u2019t cry, those quiet and expressionless, who are at greatest risk \u2014 and the two boys are becoming more like that.\nI don\u2019t pretend that the links between climate change and this food crisis are simple, or that the solutions are straightforward. I flew halfway around the world and then drove for two days to get to these villages, pumping out carbon the whole way.\nYet we do know what will help in the long run: sticking with the Paris agreement to limit global warming, as well as with President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan. We must also put a price on carbon and invest much more heavily in research on renewable energy.\nIn the short and medium term, we must step up assistance to climate refugees and sufferers, both to provide relief and to assist with new livelihoods that adjust to new climate realities. (For individuals who want to help, the organization most active in the areas I visited was Catholic Relief Services, which accepts donations for southern Madagascar.)\nThe most basic starting point is for the American president-elect to acknowledge what even illiterate Madagascar villagers understand: Climate change is real.\nAs the sun set, I told Fideline that there was a powerful man named Trump half a world away, in a country she had never heard of, who just might be able to have some impact, over many years, on the climate here. I asked her what she would tell him.\n\u201cI would ask him to do what he can, so that once more I can grow cassava, corn, black-eyed peas and sorghum,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re desperate.\u201d\nMr. President-elect, are you listening?",

Here\u2019s the sign-up.)\nGood morning.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\n\u2022 The attempted suicide bombing Monday morning was the second attack in the city in two months, and the third since September 2016.\n\u201cThe choice of New York is always for a reason, because we are a beacon to the world,\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio said afterward. \u201cAnd we actually show that a society of many faiths and many backgrounds can work.\u201d\nHere\u2019s our main article on the explosion, the result of a crudely made pipe bomb being detonated in a subway corridor near Times Square.\nA map shows the area, and surveillance video captured the moment of the blast, which seriously injured the assailant.\n\u2022 The suspect is a 27-year-old from Bangladesh who went to live in Brooklyn through a visa program available to relatives of American citizens. He told investigators that he was retaliating for U.S. airstrikes against the Islamic State. Here\u2019s what else we know about him.\n\u2022 Today\u2019s special Senate election, which has prompted one of the strangest and ugliest campaigns ever held in the state, has implications for Republicans in Congress as well as President Trump. Here are four things to watch.\nOn Monday, Roy Moore, the Republican candidate, who has been accused of sexual misconduct, rallied rural conservatives. His opponent, Doug Jones, addressed a diverse crowd in Birmingham.\n\u2022 The widely-agreed-on bottom line, according to our reporters in Alabama: \u201cIf Mr. Jones can attract the votes of young people and African-Americans, and peel away a chunk of Republican-leaning whites \u2014 particularly women \u2014 who recoil from Mr. Moore, then he has a chance to win. Otherwise, the state\u2019s conservative DNA is all but certain to kick in and rescue Mr. Moore from tribulations of his own making.\u201d\n\u2022 The NFL Network has suspended three analysts \u2014 all former players, including the Hall of Fame running back Marshall Faulk \u2014 after allegations by a former stylist.\nAlso on Monday, several women who had spoken out during the presidential campaign publicly renewed their accusations of sexual misconduct against Donald Trump. Today, President Trump blamed Democrats for the \u201cfabricated stories.\u201d\n\u2022 And we look at the inner workings of the office of Representative Blake Farenthold of Texas, who was sued by a former aide for sexual harassment. Legal documents reveal a hostile work environment that prompted one lawmaker to call Congress \u201cthe worst\u201d place for women to work.\n\u2022 Among the transformations that the North American Free Trade Agreement brought to the country: a diet more like that of its northern neighbor, complete with junk food, soda, meat \u2014 and an epidemic of diet-related illnesses.\n\u201cThe only way that Mexico became a \u2018first world\u2019 country was in terms of diet,\u201d one trade expert said.\n\u2022 The phenomenon is not limited to Mexico. Free trade is a major contributor to the spread of low-nutrient, highly processed foods from the West to developing countries worldwide.\nListen on a computer, an iOS device or an Android device.\n\u2022 The Treasury Department released a one-page analysis of the Senate tax bill that suggested the $1.5 trillion plan would more than pay for itself. The only hitch? The economy must grow much faster than any independent analysis of the bill has projected.\n\u2022 President Trump has escalated his attacks on the news media, seizing on several recent mistaken reports to bolster his case that he is being persecuted.\n\u2022 Artificial intelligence may make half of today\u2019s jobs obsolete in 20 years.

    "text": "Mafia in Italy Siphons Huge Sums From Migrant Centers\n2017-07-17T20:16:13.000Z\nISOLA DI CAPO RIZZUTO, Italy \u2014 The government provided millions of euros to care for the migrants who had arrived at the reception center at Italy\u2019s toe after traveling across deserts, war zones or choppy seas. But on many days, they were served little more than rancid chicken. Some did not eat at all when the food ran out.\nAt the same time, the priest who founded the local branch of the charity managing the center was spending money on expensive hotels and restaurants, splurging on fine wines and stashing thousands of euros in three safes at home, the authorities say. His business partners \u2014 mobsters and their associates \u2014 outfitted their bathtubs with golden taps. Some hid thousands of euros in vacuum-sealed plastic bags tucked in their fireplaces.\nThe center\u2019s managers, including the Rev. Edoardo Scordio, were among 68 people arrested this spring on charges of fraud, misuse of public money and mafia association. A yearslong investigation exposed a vast embezzlement scheme that, the authorities say, siphoned off nearly 36 million euros, or about $41 million, in government money \u2014 more than a third of the \u20ac102 million provided over a decade.\nThe case in Calabria may be just the most glaring example of how the misery of others has provided ripe opportunity for mobsters and corrupt officials as Italy struggles to keep up with an unceasing flow of migrants and refugees \u2014 more than 93,000 so far this year alone.\nThe swelling of the migrant population, investigators say, has made the running of reception centers a cottage industry of potential government corruption and mafia penetration.\nIn recent years, centers all over Italy have been shut for fraud or misuse of public money, exposing insufficient government oversight and often blatant corruption. In the Rome-based Mafia Capitale investigation, managers at a company that secured lucrative public bids to provide services for reception centers are currently standing trial.\n\u201cMobsters are where power and money are,\u201d said Nicola Gratteri, one of Italy\u2019s more active anti-mafia investigators. He is the chief prosecutor in Catanzaro, in Calabria, home to one of Italy\u2019s most powerful mafia groups, the \u2019Ndrangheta (pronounced n-DRAHN-ghe-ta).\n\u201cBeyond cocaine smuggling, \u2019Ndrangheta mobsters used to be strong on extortion and public bids; now it\u2019s gaming and the migrants centers,\u201d Mr. Gratteri explained in his office, behind an armored door. \u201cThey are just one of the ways to become richer for the mafia.\u201d\nThe central government in Rome, as well as the European Union, provided the reception center in Calabria with roughly \u20ac30 a day for each of the migrants housed in a former NATO base surrounded by razor wire.\nThe money was supposed to go toward food, housing, personal items, and even social workers and Italian teachers to help the migrants integrate and learn the language.\nInstead, using hundreds of hours of hidden camera recordings and reams of administrative documents, investigators say, they found that the center\u2019s catering service did not provide decent food to migrants, or even enough, while invoicing the Interior Ministry for thousands of meals every day.\nWaiters in the cafeteria were recorded on videos raising their hands in a shrug to indicate that the food had run out, while dozens were still awaiting their meal.\nMigrants did not receive a daily allowance of \u20ac2.50 in pocket money, but a card that could be used only at the vending machines inside the center, allowing mob associates to profit.\nThe center also vastly inflated the number of migrants it was caring for, milking the government for still more money than it was due, the investigators say.\nRather than provide aid to the migrants \u2014 many of them from central Africa, Pakistan and Bangladesh \u2014 much of the money went to fund a host of projects, either for the amusement of the mobsters and their business associates, or to allow them to profit still further.\nThe enterprises included a sumptuous movie theater, still under construction; a new sports field; and travel agencies and boat rentals so tourists could explore the turquoise waters of the Capo Rizzuto\u2019s marine reservoir.\nA portion of the money went directly to fund the local \u2019Ndrangheta, a family-run mafia association that is Europe\u2019s primary importer of cocaine, with tentacles all over the globe.\nOne benefit of the cash flow, the local authorities and residents say, was that it at least provided enough money for all the notoriously violent and reckless \u2019Ndrangheta families in the area, calming the competition and bloodshed among them.\nMagistrates noted that the internecine war had stopped in the early 2000s, after the charity took over the reception center in Isola di Capo Rizzuto, a town of 15,000 in one of Europe\u2019s poorest regions.\nThe last violent episode happened in 2004 on a dusty road, bordered by the wind turbines that mobsters operated, leading from the town to one of its pristine beaches, when rival mobsters annihilated the most prominent member of the resident family, Carmine Arena.\nA hail of machine gun bullets devastated the armored Lancia car in which he was leaving his home, a villa hidden behind a high wall and an iron gate.\n\u201cWars stop when cash starts flowing in,\u201d said Mr. Gratteri, the prosecutor, who is a co-author of a dozen historical books on Italy\u2019s indigenous criminal groups. \u201cThen, they no longer have a reason to fight and attract police attention.\u201d\nIn fact, the \u2019Ndrangheta uses violence only to defend its business or territory, and it flourishes when it has consensus, he said.\nIn Isola di Capo Rizzuto, the charity involved in the scandal was the local independent branch of Misericordia, run by Father Scordio.\nThe nationwide charity does nonprofit social work \u2014 like operating ambulances and civil protection services \u2014 through public bids or donations, and with the help of volunteers. Prosecutors have found no connection between the national charity and the local scandal.\nThe Misericordia of Isola di Capo Rizzuto, unusual in size, provides over 300 jobs. The local charity\u2019s managers have been suspended, and the association has been put under judicial administration, though it still runs the center.\n\u201cIn Isola, everyone works or knows someone who works for them, so people prefer not to take sides,\u201d said Antonio Tata, the local representative for Libera, the anti-mafia association also founded by a priest, the Rev. Luigi Ciotti.\nMr. Tata explained that a few years ago, Father Scordio, in a public sermon, had spoken of an \u201cinvasion\u201d when Libera took part in a public bid to work about 250 acres of olive groves, wheat and barley fields confiscated from the Arena family after members were convicted of mob association.\nFather Scordio seemingly disliked the presence of the anti-mafia association in his area.\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t think that he had organized such a business,\u201d Mr. Tata said of Father Scordio. \u201cBut we knew that, in small towns like Isola, people consider normal the presence of \u2019Ndrangheta families. They are historically used to them.\u201d\nBut other residents said it seemed clear to all that the charity and the mobsters were in business together.\nA resident who has lived in Isola di Capo Rizzuto for 40 years said people in the town suspected something was wrong, with the migrants protesting in the streets about their squalid living conditions despite the millions of euros in government aid.

    "text": "New York Today: Advice for Fasting\n2017-06-21T10:03:10.000Z\nGood morning on this (officially) summer Wednesday.\nIt\u2019s the homestretch of Ramadan, the holiest month in the Islamic calendar.\nThe holiday requires Muslims to fast from the moment sunlight is visible on the horizon until dusk. Today, the longest day of the year, there can be no food or drink from just before 4 a.m. until about8:30 p.m.\nWe asked New York Today readers to share tips for fasting during holidays. The advice was both spiritual and, well, practical.\n\u201cDrink something with electrolytes and eat something with a lot of protein,\u201d said Tremont Poole, 48, who is fasting for his 36th Ramadan. His go-to beverage outside fasting hours is coconut water mixed with a salt pill, and his dish of choice is eggs with diced chicken or ground beef, and a whole-wheat or whole-grain bagel.\nTo go with the meals \u2014 \u201csuhoor\u201d in the early morning and \u201ciftar\u201d in the evening \u2014 H. Ali Mohammed, 64, offered these words for the soul: \u201cLess materialism. More spirituality. Think and pray for the desolate. Give alms to the poor.\u201d\nChanit Roston, who fasts on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, engages her other senses to distract from the hunger pangs. \u201cI smell fragrant flowers or essential oils and breathe deeply,\u201d she told us, adding how she is also \u201cgrateful for being in charge of what enters my lips.\u201d\nA month before the Ramadan fast begins, Imam Khalid Latif, the chaplain for the Islamic Center at New York University, hosts workshops with nutritionists to teach congregants about what to eat (foods high in fiber, like fruits and vegetables, and high in protein, like nuts and dates), what not to eat (foods that are processed or oily), how to hydrate (more water, less caffeine and sugar), and why healthy sleep patterns are crucial.\n\u201cTake time to rest and ensure your sleep quality, because a lot of your hydration level is going to be tied to the sleep you\u2019re getting,\u201d Mr. Latif said.\nRamadan, which began in late May and ends this weekend, places added emphasis on the final days of the month, when Muslims engage in longer periods of prayer.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a night within those 10 nights that is said to have the equivalency of a thousand months\u2019 worth of worship,\u201d Mr. Latif said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about empty stomachs,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s about full hearts and how you get to a place where you\u2019re limiting the consumption of your physical and you start to engage in the nourishing of the metaphysical, your internal.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what else is happening:\nIt\u2019s the solstice.\nYou might wish for better weather on the longest day of the year: We\u2019re expecting some showers and thunder in the afternoon.\nThe high will be near 82.\nAh, summer in the city.\n\u2022 Long Island Rail Road riders whose trains are diverted from Pennsylvania Station will receive an average discount of 25 percent.

    "text": "\u2018At the Stroke of Midnight My Entire Family Was Displaced\u2019\n2017-08-14T07:00:28.000Z\nAugust marks the 70th anniversary of the end of British colonial rule in India and the creation of the two independent countries of India and Pakistan, carved along religious and political lines. More than 10 million people were uprooted. We asked readers how they or their families were affected. These are some of their stories. \nIn 1947 I was 10. We lived in comfort in Jammu and Kashmir state.\nWe lost everything at the time of the creation of Pakistan. Things can be replaced, not lives.\nMy father, an intellectual and educationalist, was murdered. Eight of us crossed into Pakistan dressed in summer clothes and nothing else. Winter came and we had nothing to wear and no roof over our heads. By the following summer my feet had outgrown my shoes and I had to walk barefoot on scorching earth. My feet sometimes still feel that hot surface.\nEven today I get nightmares about my father\u2019s murder. As a physician I wonder how the end came. Was he in pain, was he cold, was he thirsty, was he calling out for me?\n\u2014 Tariq Malik\nMy father, Anand B. Khorana, was about 10 years old at the time of partition. His father was a civil engineer and the whole family (my grandparents, father and his five siblings) had recently moved into a new home they built as a mark of their \u201cmiddle-class\u201d status. The oldest child, a daughter, had recently become engaged. The family had lived for generations in the state of Punjab and could not conceive of living any place else. As my late father told it, everyone had heard rumblings about the state being divided into a Pakistani half and an Indian half, but few thought it would happen imminently.\nAt the stroke of midnight my entire family was displaced. Their land and home were deemed to be on the Pakistani side and in a few days it was pretty clear that a Hindu family, regardless of their prior status, was in danger. I don\u2019t know all the details but, unlike most families who decided to emigrate immediately (many losing their lives on the trains in the process), my father\u2019s family went into hiding for a few months. My father recalled hiding in a Muslim family\u2019s house (a former employee of my grandfather\u2019s).\nEventually, things calmed down and the family made the trek to India and resettled, initially in Delhi in refugee quarters. My grandfather was able to find a job similar to his prior one. All of their property, including the house they had recently built, was lost but the family was grateful to have made it out alive \u2014 unlike so many others. The only person believed lost was the eldest daughter\u2019s fianc\u00e9 but, a year later, she spotted him at a train station in Delhi. They married and had several children.\n\u2014 Alok A. Khorana\nMy parents were young when they walked from what\u2019s now Bangladesh to India. Baba called East Pakistan \u201chome\u201d until he died in 2004. His family, landowners in Dhaka, fled with their belongings; copper utensils, large bowls, plates. He used to say, \u201cWe never needed anything, so we didn\u2019t know the value of money. We carried the heavy utensils, because we thought copper was more valuable than silver. We were children, what were we to do?\u201d\nWhen Baba\u2019s bank job moved him to New Delhi, he spent days recreating his childhood vegetable garden. Cabbage, cauliflower, peas, spinach, okra, we had it all. He used to say, \u201cOur pumpkins were bigger than the sun!\u201d and I would believe him. Everything in Bangladesh, the place he left, was better. The roses were more fragrant, the eggplants more purple, the fish were fresher \u2014 Delhi could never compete.\nMa was 12 when her family fled Barisal for Kolkata. They sold everything, including Ma\u2019s favorite school books. She mourned those books until she died, in 2008. But she was proud that she hadn\u2019t marked any of them with a pen or pencil. \u201cThey were pristine,\u201d she would say, \u201cso Thakur da could sell them at a premium. That money helped us escape.\u201d\n\u2014 Madhushree Ghosh\nMy father\u2019s family was part of the British colonial administration. During partition my father was in Pakistan attending school while the rest of his family was in Pune, India. As hostilities erupted between Hindus and Muslims, my father was cut off from his family. He couldn\u2019t get British citizenship because most of his papers were lost during the upheaval. So, in the \u201950s, he made his way to the United Arab Emirates by ship and started a family there.\nMy siblings and I have been effectively stateless. Although we are familiar with Indian and Pakistani culture, we belonged to neither culture. We grew up in the Middle East, in Dubai, among other Asians but could not identify with them.\n\u2014 S. Jones\nWhen partition was announced, my father, who worked for the British Indian Government, was posted in Bombay. He was advised that as a Muslim he would have better career opportunities in Pakistan. He was asked to report to offices in Rawalpindi as soon as possible. He left and my mother, Rosy, who was 20, and their six-month-old daughter stayed behind until he could arrange for their accommodation. Because of the chaos he could not come back to get them, so he asked my mother to take a train to Lahore. On the train a Sikh gentleman noticed my mother alone with an infant and asked her where she was going. When she told him Lahore, he was shocked and told her about the massacres that were taking place on trains going to Pakistan \u2014 my mother and father hadn\u2019t known.\nHe said he was traveling to Amritsar (30 miles from Lahore) but would accompany her to Wagah, a border town between India and Pakistan, because he would never forgive himself if anything happened to her. He told my mother that if anyone asked, she was his daughter. He thought her name, Rosy, was fine since it was secular. But my sister\u2019s name, Shahina, was distinctly Muslim, so if anyone asked her name was Nina.\nHe stayed with them until Wagah and walked with them to the Pakistani border, kissed them both on their foreheads and told them he wished he could take them all the way to Lahore, but he would not make it back alive.\nMy sister, who lives in Karachi, is still called Nina by everyone in the family. My mother insisted on that.\n\u2014 Sohail Murad\nOn Sept. 7, a bespectacled Sikh man, much like my father, was killed in town and a rumor spread that he had come to set fire to the local mosque. \nThe next day dislocated families from surrounding villages who had taken shelter in schoolyards, grain markets and other vulnerable locations were attacked. I can still hear the cries of people shot or stabbed outside the Gurdwara and the gunfire that began around 4 p.m., as the last train left the Jaranwala Railway Station, in Pakistan, and continued into the evening.\nThat night women and children were sheltering in a room on the second floor of the Gurdwara with instructions on what to do if the militia broke through the doors and entered the temple. The thought still gives me chills. The temperature outside was in the 90s Fahrenheit, but inside the heat was oppressive. Some men stayed on the main floor or on the rooftop lookout, armed with sticks, swords, a pistol and one double-barreled gun. We were certain our end was imminent. We prayed as we imagined the worst.\nAlmighty God had other plans. For the next three days we holed-up in the Gurdwara. Our ranks swelled with the addition of the injured who were able to escape. We heard rumors that we would be attacked on Sept. 12, after Friday prayers. But there was a knock at the giant door of the temple around 10 a.m. and four Sikh military officers ordered us to leave in ten minutes and said they would escort us to the caravan of refugees that was passing. Everyone scrambled and ran with the clothes on their backs, relieved and hopeful to live another day or die with others traveling toward the new border and sanctuary of India.\n\u2014 Kanwal Prakash \u201cKP\u201d Singh\nMy father was a refugee and a migrant. As his child I have lived a peripatetic life, but have always been able to maintain connections with my family in Pakistan. I lived in Aligarh while I was researching my dissertation and visited the home where my father and my grandmother were born. I met the son of the family who had migrated from Lahore and received the home as refugee property (though he had been born later, in independent India). I was probably the first member of my family to visit the home since 1947 and met people who remembered my family, who were known for their love of rooftop kite flying. The family who lives there now sent homemade sweets for me to take to my Pakistani family.\n\u2014 Amber Abbas\nMy mother\u2019s younger brother lived in Jammu and must have been a lad of 15 at the time of the partition. He was aware of the mass violence around him, but he did not take up arms and perpetuate the violence. He was a strong swimmer, and he spent days carrying two Muslims from the East to the West and then two Hindus from the West to the East on his shoulders \u2014 back and forth. My uncle\u2019s story reminds me that people can stop the cycle of violence.\n\u2014 Ripudaman Malhotra\nMy paternal grandfather and grandmother moved to Bombay during partition with their two little sons. I shared a room with my grandfather growing up and heard stories of how things were before and silences about what happened during. In his last year my grandfather would often weep about partition. It was not a national tragedy for him, but a very personal one. \nMy maternal grandfather moved to Lucknow in India at the height of the violence. They lost many cousins and relations, but the immediate family made it safely. He restarted an optical shop called Lahore Opticals, named after the city of his birth, and became successful. When Hindu-Muslim strife breaks out in India, the shop is invariably targeted. But my grandfather never changed the name. His shop is now run by my uncle and is still named after the city they fled, now in Pakistan.\n\u2014 Ritesh Batra",

    "text": "Neil Gorsuch, Executive Orders: Your Tuesday Evening Briefing\n2017-01-31T22:51:08.000Z\n(Want to get this briefing by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.)\nGood evening. Here\u2019s the latest.\n1. President Donald Trump announced his nominee for the Supreme Court: Neil Gorsuch, a 49-year-old conservative who resembles Antonin Scalia in both philosophy and style.\nJudge Gorsuch \u2014 who was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, in Denver, by President George W. Bush \u2014 is an originalist, meaning he tries to interpret the Constitution consistently with the understanding of those who drafted and adopted it. This approach leads him to generally but not uniformly conservative results.\nHe called Justice Scalia \u201ca lion of the law\u201d as he accepted the nomination.\n_____\n2. A jarring new level of conflict has hit Washington.\n Democrats skipped scheduled confirmation votes on Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees to lead the United States Treasury and the Department of Health and Human Services. And they renewed a push to block the nominee for attorney general, Jeff Sessions. Republicans showed no sign of breaking ranks as they defended him.\nThe acting attorney general Mr. Trump fired on Monday, Sally Yates, refused to defend his executive order on immigration because Mr. Trump\u2019s own words persuaded her that he was singling out Muslims.\nAnd a State Department dissent cable asserting that the order would not make the country safer has been signed by over 1,000 officials around the world.\n_____\n3. It was the last day to sign up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.\nTalk of repealing the law injected confusion into the last weeks of the enrollment period. In some places, people steadily signed up until the last minute. Elsewhere, people saw little point in doing so.\nWe asked readers to tell us how they\u2019d be affected if the law were repealed. Here\u2019s what they said.\n_____\n4. Bangladesh is moving forward with an internationally criticized plan to transfer Rohingya refugees who fled Myanmar from camps located near resorts to a largely uninhabitable island in the Bay of Bengal.\nThe site is hours from the mainland and submerged during the monsoon season.\nThe refugees said they were not consulted. One of them observed, \u201cAt the end of the day, what we want or don\u2019t want is not going to matter to anyone.\u201d\n_____\n5. In India, a deadly medical mystery had a surprising solution.\nResearchers had suspected that heat stroke, infections or pesticides caused sporadic outbreaks of a disease that struck only children.\nBut a two-year medical investigation found the truth: Compounds in the tropical lychee fruit can be fatal to malnourished children.\n_____\n6. Come along with us on a visit to Beaver, Alaska, a village of about 60 people near the Arctic Circle.\nIt\u2019s essentially an island on a mostly empty landscape. At this time of year, the temperature can plummet to 50 degrees below zero or lower. A breath unfiltered by a face mask can freeze the lungs.\nAnd the challenges for residents range from keeping their tiny school open to shopping for groceries by airmail.\n_____\n7. USA Football, the national governing body for the amateur version of the game, intends to introduce a drastically altered youth football game.\nThe move is a response to declining participation and increasing public belief that the game is not safe for children to play. The field will be smaller and it will be less violent.\nThe organization\u2019s head called it \u201cthe future of the game.\u201d\n_____\n8. Home cooks are raving about the Instant Pot, a device that combines an electric pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker and yogurt maker.\nOne of our food writers tried it out (and a similar unit from another company) and now she\u2019s a convert. She says you can\u2019t use it for every dish, but it\u2019s super-convenient for soups, stews and the like.\n\u201cIt\u2019s as user-friendly as a slow cooker \u2014 except that it gets dinner on the table a day or so faster,\u201d she wrote.\n_____\n9. We\u2019ve been combing the archives of Times wedding announcements, and here\u2019s the latest gem that turned up.\nMary Landon Baker was a fabulously wealthy heiress who left the same man at the altar three times in the 1920s. It made the papers all over the world, and she became known as the \u201cshy bride.\u201d\nBut that was a somewhat misleading nickname. She went through lovers \u201clike General Sherman blazing a path to the sea,\u201d and reportedly received 65 proposals, but never married.\n_____\n10. The star of the wildly popular BBC series \u201cDoctor Who\u201d has announced that he is leaving the show.\nPeter Capaldi, who has played the Doctor since 2013 and is the 12th star of the long-running series, said it was time \u201cto move on to different challenges.\u201d\nThe next season, which starts in April, will be his last.\n_____\n11. Finally, the 140-year-old Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show has added three new breeds to its annual event.\nAnd cats.\nThe show runs on Feb. 11, 13 and 14, and it is expected to feature more than 2,800 dogs \u2014 and some special guests, like the Bengal above.\n_____\nPhotographs may appear out of order for some readers. Viewing this version of the briefing should help.\nYour Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.\nAnd don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a.m. Sundays.\nWant to look back?

The Royal Academy of Arts is bringing together Charles I\u2019s collection of art from the 15th to the 17th century, including works by Titian, Van Dyck, Rubens, Holbein and Mantegna. A quick refresher: Charles I\u2019s authoritarian rule eventually led to his execution. Oh, if those paintings could talk.\nPAKISTAN and UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, Jan. 7 \u2014 21: Blind players from Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Australia, South Africa and the West Indies use a hard plastic \u201caudio ball\u201d in the Blind Cricket World Cup for a game that has been around since the 1920s.\nSOUTH KOREA, Feb. 9 \u2014 25: Leave it to an Olympic city to set a record: Pyeongchang will be the first-ever Winter Games city to award over 100 gold medals. Among the new events: men\u2019s and women\u2019s mass-start speed skating and big-air snowboarding.\nCHINA, Feb. 16: In 2017, it was believed that there would be a fine of up to 100,000 renminbi, or about $14,500, for selling dog meat in the week before the Yulin Lychee and Dog Meat Festival in June of 2017. Although animal-welfare advocates considered the temporary ban a victory, the meat was still available during the festival. Will dog meat sales continue in 2018, otherwise known as the Year of the Dog? Thousands of online petition signatories hope not.\nRUSSIA, March: If President Vladimir V. Putin runs in the country\u2019s next presidential election and is successful, he will become the longest serving Russian leader since Stalin. His most vocal critic, Aleksei Navalny, has promised to run for president, despite being disqualified by his five-year suspension sentence on charges of embezzlement.\nHONG KONG, March 29 \u2014 31: Looking to make that perfect acquisition but can\u2019t make it to Miami or Basel?

Art Basel Hong Kong is Asia\u2019s biggest art fair, where you\u2019ll be sure to find something from one of the many emerging or powerhouse galleries.\nMOROCCO, April 6 \u2014 16: Running about 156 miles in the Sahara? Piece of meskouta (Moroccan cake)! Just don\u2019t forget to bring some water. Participants in the Marathon des Sables drink 32,000 gallons of mineral water on average over the 10-day haul.\nFRANCE, April 2: With HBO, Amazon, Netflix and others shelling out the big bucks for film-production-quality television, Cannes has its timing right to launch a new festival with an official selection of 10 unseen TV series. Vive la television!\nUNITED STATES: You leave millennials stranded without adequate food or shelter on a Bahamian island, and 81 percent say they\u2019d still go back. The now-infamous organizers of the Fyre Festival, which was marketed as a once-in-a-lifetime luxury experience featuring rock bands, celebrity chefs and V.I.P. accommodations, are giving it another go.\nITALY: May 26 \u2014 Nov. 25: The Italians get to host the world\u2019s foremost art and architecture festivals every other year on an island that\u2019s set to sink (whether by water or by tourism, is as yet unclear). The theme for this year\u2019s Venice Architecture Biennale is \u201cFreespace,\u201d focused on the generosity, quality and humanity of architecture.\nCATALONIA, June \u2014 November: The Catalonians have been taking castells (or human towers) to new heights since the early 1700s. Watch a child climb to the top of a nine-person tower and hold up four fingers to represent the four stripes of the Catalan flag. Unesco has added the spectacle to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\nFRANCE, July 7: Several mega-fans of the annual cycling race Tour de France were left \u201c\u00e0 bout de souffle\u201d (\u201cbreathless\u201d) when they learned about two big changes this year: Le Tour will start a week later than usual to avoid too much screen-time overlap with the FIFA World Cup, where the French team is among the favorites to win.

At the biggest light festival in the northern Polish city of Torun, art is expressed in \u201csituations.\u201d Water and light situations, that is, which explore the different ways that light can interact aesthetically with water. Categories include \u201cPleasure vs. Danger\u201d and \u201cGlobal Vital Commodity vs. Natural Element of the Cosmos.\u201d\nINDONESIA, Aug. 18 \u2014 Sept. 2: The pancontinental Asian Games, also known as the \u201cAsiad,\u201d are recognized by the International Olympic Committee and feature sports like sepak takraw (kick volleyball) and the Chinese martial art of wushu.\nWORLDWIDE, Oct. 16: There\u2019s still over 10 years left to achieve the United Nations\u2019 goal of ending global hunger by 2030, and World Food Day aims to raise awareness.

It was the first safety approval for Tepco since the 2011 meltdown at Fukushima.\n\u2022 Uber\u2019s board approved changes that will reshape the balance of power at the company, paving the way for an investment by SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate, and for the company to go public by 2019.\n\u2022 Equifax\u2019s former chief executive told U.S. lawmakers that an error by a single employee had led to a data breach that exposed the personal information of almost 146 million people.\n\u2022 U.S. stocks were flat. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets.\n \u2022 A prank, a cough and a collapsing stage set: Prime Minister Theresa May needed a rousing speech to restore her authority over Britain\u2019s warring Conservatives, but instead she had a nightmare. [The New York Times]\n\u2022 Aid groups in Bangladesh say they need $434 million over the next six months to help more than 800,000 Rohingya refugees, many of them children, and their host communities. More than 500,000 Rohingya arrived over the last five weeks. [The Guardian]\n\u2022 A lawmaker fled Cambodia citing the threat of imminent arrest. Now almost half the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party\u2019s sitting lawmakers have left the country. [Phnom Penh Post]\n\u2022 Three scientists were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing cryo-electron microscopy, a method for generating three-dimensional images of the molecules of life. The prize for literature is announced today. [The New York Times]\n\u2022 The leader of Catalonia, Carles Puigdemont, said in a televised speech that he wanted a negotiated settlement to the region\u2019s territorial conflict with the government in Madrid. He made no mention of plans for a unilateral declaration of independence from Spain. [The New York Times]\n\u2022 Iran barred Dorsa Derakhshani from playing chess for her homeland after she refused to wear a hijab.

In this 360 video, head out with a driverless car service that runs tests with older Californians.\nOn this day in 1947, Harry Truman delivered the first televised presidential address from the White House. (Since most Americans didn\u2019t have TVs at the time, it was also broadcast over the radio. Here\u2019s the full audio clip, a transcript and the Times front page the next day.)\nWith winter approaching, President Truman asked Americans to cut back on their consumption of proteins and grains to help hungry Europeans struggling to rebuild after World War II.\n\u201cIf the peace should be lost because we failed to share our food with hungry people, there would be no more tragic example in all history of a peace needlessly lost.\u201d\nHe called for no meat on Tuesdays, no poultry or eggs on Thursdays, and saving a slice of bread every day. Public restaurants were asked to serve bread and butter only on request.\nThe broadcast was part of a special on food conservation, and other government officials, including Secretary of State George C. Marshall, spoke too.\nA day later, the Citizens Food Committee announced special low-grain (but still pretty high-fat) White House menus. Among the items: cheese souffle; coffee mallow, a rich dessert; and \u201cperfection salad,\u201d a gelatin mold made with cabbage.\nKaren Zraick contributed reporting. \n_____\nYour Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

    "text": "Senate, North Korea, Uber: Your Tuesday Evening Briefing\n2017-11-28T23:12:31.000Z\n(Want to get this briefing by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.)\nGood evening. Here\u2019s the latest.\n1. Senate Republicans are making progress in their push to pass a tax bill by Friday.\nThe Senate Budget Committee passed the bill along party lines, allowing it to proceed to the floor. The leadership is scrambling to corral uncommitted senators and jump through procedural hoops. Here\u2019s the latest.\nPresident Trump was on Capitol Hill for a lunch with Republican senators, above. He escalated the threat of a government shutdown, which would occur if lawmakers cannot agree on a separate spending measure.\nWe modeled what the Senate bill would look like for 25,000 middle-class families. Just as with health care, its fate could rest with Senator John McCain.\n_____\n2. The courts are still deciding who will lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the nation\u2019s top consumer watchdog.\nBut they ruled that while they decide, Mick Mulvaney, above, President Trump\u2019s pick as acting director, can stay in office. We look at the messy fight for control \u2014 and the deregulatory pressures the agency faces \u2014 on our \u201cThe Daily\u201d podcast.\n_____\n3. A Libyan militia leader became the first person successfully prosecuted in the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi in 2012, seen above.\nAhmed Abu Khattala was convicted on four counts, including conspiracy to provide material support for terrorism, in a federal court in Washington.\nIn a surprise, he was acquitted of murder. Still, he faces up to 60 years in prison.\n_____\n4. North Korea conducted its first missile test in more than two months. Within minutes, South Korea fired a missile to demonstrate its ability to strike the North\u2019s launch sites.\nThe exchange came after a senior South Korean official warned that the North was working on being able to launch nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles as early as next year.\nNo wonder Hawaii is bringing back its Cold War-era nuclear warning system. Above, the North\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, with scientists in September.\n_____\n5. In Myanmar, Pope Francis met with the country\u2019s civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, above.\nBut in a closely watched speech, he avoided directly addressing the situation of the persecuted Rohingya minority, or even mentioning the term.\nHe is scheduled to say Mass in Yangon tomorrow before an expected crowd of 200,000 and to meet with Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh later in the week.\n_____\n6. Just a day before jury selection was to start, a federal judge delayed a trade secrets trial between Uber and Waymo, Alphabet\u2019s self-driving car unit.\nHe based the decision on a letter written by a lawyer for a former Uber employee. The letter not only contradicted statements from the company\u2019s lawyers, it also asserted that Uber had a secret team dedicated to corporate spying and impeding legal cases against it.\n\u201cI can no longer trust the words of the lawyers for Uber in this case,\u201d the judge said. \u201cIf even half of what is in that letter is true, it would be an injustice for Waymo to go to trial.\u201d\n_____\n7. Jay-Z, above, and Kendrick Lamar led the nominees for the 60th annual Grammy Awards, coming Jan. 28.\nThe list was heavy on hip-hop and R&B, and shut out some pop stars from the major categories (Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u201cShape of You,\u201d one of the year\u2019s biggest hits, fell into best pop solo).\nCompeting for album of the year are Jay-Z and Mr. Lamar; Bruno Mars, Childish Gambino and Lorde. Here are the nominees in the top 20 categories.\n_____\n8. The International Olympic Committee\u2019s decision next week on how to punish Russia for doping will be informed by the diaries of a complicit Russian chemist. We got an exclusive look.\nGrigory Rodchenkov spent years helping Russia\u2019s athletes gain an edge by using banned substances. His diaries from 2014 and 2015 \u2014 his final years as Russia\u2019s antidoping lab chief before he fled to the U.S. \u2014 provide new details about the elaborate cheating at the last Winter Games in Sochi.\n_____\n9. This week\u2019s Times Magazine cover story is a profile of Sean Hannity, the Fox News host Stephen Bannon called \u201cthe single most important voice for the \u2018deplorables.\u2019\u201d\nHe\u2019s become the face of the network in the post-O\u2019Reilly era. With more than 13 million nightly viewers, he is also one of President Trump\u2019s most public defenders.\nAfter the article published, Mr. Hannity tweeted some criticism of our choice of cover photograph, above.\n_____\n10. Finally, can Meghan Markle save the monarchy?\nThe novelist Irenosen Okojie wrote in an Op-Ed that Ms. Markle\u2019s relationship with Prince Harry \u201cmade me, a black British woman, see the royals slightly differently.\u201d\n\u201cNot since Diana, Princess of Wales, has there been this kind of interest from young people in a member of the royal family,\u201d she added.\nThe late-night hosts celebrated the news of their engagement, too. But Trevor Noah thought \u201cdiversity\u201d was getting too much attention: \u201cIt\u2019s 2017, people. It shouldn\u2019t matter that one of them is a ginger.\u201d (Harry is, of course, a redhead.)\nHave a great night.\n_____\nYour Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.\nAnd don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a.m. Sundays.\nWant to catch up on past briefings?

Here are five takeaways.\nMr. Xi\u2019s rise has been marked by rekindled enthusiasm for traditional culture. Witness how his embrace of the Confucian philosopher Wang Yangming prompted one city to build a theme park, construct a museum and even commission a robot to bring him to life.\n_____\n\u2022 Newly declassified U.S. State Department files show that American officials looked on silently during Indonesia\u2019s anti-Communist blood bath in the mid-60s \u2014 and at times even applauded the forces behind the killings of at least half a million people.\nCold War attitudes may have motivated U.S. diplomats to simply watch as mass extrajudicial executions spread beyond suspected Communists to target ethnic Chinese, students and union members. Above, President Kennedy with President Sukarno in 1961.\n_____\n\u2022 \u201cWe really hold the military leadership accountable.\u201d \nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson was harsh in condemning Myanmar\u2019s reported atrocities against Rohingya Muslims and demanded access to allow a \u201cfull accounting.\u201d\nSince Sunday, as many as 15,000 Rohingya have crossed into Bangladesh, a U.N. spokesman said, where the refugees are waiting to enter already overcrowded camps.\n_____\n\u2022 Our photographer went to the front lines of the fight against the Islamic State in Raqqa, Syria, recording the Kurdish and Arab forces who have now declared victory. Above, a funeral for one of the fighters.\nCounterterrorism experts say the Islamic State is down, but not out, with an estimated 6,000 to 10,000 fighters in Iraq and Syria; branches in North Africa and Asia; a large online network; and possibly sleeper cells abroad.\n_____\n\u2022 Hermit Kingdom? Not exactly. \nNorth Korea\u2019s economy grew 3.9 percent last year, and the country annually generates about a billion dollars in invisible income.\nOur magazine details how, despite being blocked from international financial institutions, the North manages to sells arms, coal, seafood, textiles and, not least, the labor of exported workers. And our writer asks: How long will China continue to be its love-hate enabler?\n_____\n\u2022 A very strange tale. \nA Times investigation uncovered a secretive organization that lured in women with promises of empowerment, demanded they turn over naked photographs or other compromising material \u2014 and then held them down and branded them below the hip, searing a symbol into their skin.\nThe group, Nxivm (pronounced Nex-e-um), has been operating across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\n\u2022 More trouble for Samsung: The South Korean police raided its construction arm\u2019s head office in an inquiry into whether Lee Kun-hee, above, the conglomerate\u2019s patriarch and the father of its jailed crown prince, misappropriated funds to renovate his family home.\n\u2022 Silicon Valley\u2019s smaller companies used to unseat the big ones. But now the giants just eat them, our tech columnist argues in his latest consideration of the unnerving power of Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft.\n\u2022 Rio Tinto, the British-Australian mining giant, was charged with fraud by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for inflating the value of coal assets in Mozambique.\n\u2022 China\u2019s economy grew 6.8 percent in the third quarter, the government said, in line with expectations.\n\u2022 Thai stocks are booming as the royal transition nears completion.\n\u2022 Google\u2019s Pixel 2 phone is an impressive but costly extravagance, according to our reviewer.\n\u2022 U.S. stocks were higher. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets.\n\u2022 U.S. threats to send in SEAL Team 6 prompted Pakistan\u2019s operation to free an American woman, her Canadian husband and their children from the Taliban-linked Haqqani network. Above, the family is back in Canada. [The New York Times]\n\u2022 A condolence call from President Trump became a political flash point, after accounts surfaced that he had told the widow of a U.S. soldier killed in Niger that he \u201cknew what he signed up for.\u201d [The New York Times]\n\u2022 The U.N. refugee agency demanded that Australia step in to avert a humanitarian emergency over the pending, abrupt closure of the Manus Island immigration detention center.

In the Western Conference, the Warriors face a refueled Rockets squad. In the Eastern, where Cavaliers and Celtics have stockpiled stars. But opening night was surprising, and painful.\n\u2022 When Japanese phonemakers introduced emojis in the late 1990s, they likely didn\u2019t foresee the chaos that would be unleashed on the mission to standardize the world\u2019s alphabets.\n\u2022 In South Korea, concern over the North is mostly viewed through decisions made in Washington, according to our Interpreter column. Scrapping the Iran nuclear deal, for instance, is seen as making a deal with Pyongyang impossible.\n\u2022 A new line of condoms available in 60 sizes for the U.S. market was a tough story to tackle seriously, our reporter recalls.\nFor visitors to Madrid, the starting point is often Plaza Mayor, which is 400 years old this year.\nThe plaza was created as a city center for the new capital of Madrid, where the Spanish royal court relocated from Toledo in the mid-16th century. Construction began in 1617, during the reign of King Philip III, who is memorialized by an equestrian statue in the center.\nThe square was built on the site of the market at Plaza del Arrabal, and was later called Plaza de la Constituci\u00f3n, Plaza Real, Plaza de la Rep\u00fablica and finally Plaza Mayor.\nThe plaza has seen almost as many fires as it has names. It had to be rebuilt after blazes in 1631, 1670 and 1790. It now consists of three stories, nine archways and 237 balconies.\nThe site of bullfights, coronations and executions during the Spanish Inquisition, the plaza is now home to shops, restaurants and an annual Christmas market.\nMadrid has marked this year\u2019s anniversary with lectures, screenings and music and dance performances. For a few days recently, the plaza was also covered with grass. \u201cI wanted to recover the spirit of that green space,\u201d the artist behind the project, SpY, told El Pa\u00eds, citing the plaza\u2019s history as earth and garden.\nJennifer Jett contributed reporting.\n_____\nYour Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

    "text": "The Ad Feels a Bit Like Oscar Bait, but It\u2019s Trying to Sell You an iPhone\n2017-04-02T18:25:52.000Z\nCarrie Brownstein, the actress known for the series \u201cPortlandia,\u201d wrote and directed a short film last fall that pokes fun at the exaggerated comments people post under pictures of celebrities on social media, showing what would happen if reverential remarks like \u201cMom\u201d or \u201cmarry me\u201d played out in the real world.\nThe film, just under seven minutes long, was not about clothes but was funded by the fashion brand Kenzo, in the sort of arrangement between advertisers and artists that has become common enough to command its own industry award at the Tribeca Film Festival. Ms. Brownstein\u2019s film is among 10 finalists for the Tribeca X Award, along with others paid for by Apple and BMW.\nThe competition looks to reward the best \u201cstorytelling\u201d from brands working with artists and filmmakers. It drew 600 entries in its second year, triple the number from last year, showcasing the growth in a subtle type of marketing that aims to reach people who are tuning out of traditional commercials.\nRather than deliver a product pitch, this genre is focused on \u201ctelling stories that make people feel warmly about the brand,\u201d said Andrew Essex, the chief executive of Tribeca Enterprises. Apple, for example, sponsored a 13-minute documentary about a mountain-climbing Bangladeshi woman that happened to be shot entirely on an iPhone 6s. Another finalist: an eight-minute film from the mobile payments company Square, telling the story of a Syrian refugee\u2019s dreams after his move to Tennessee; the man is a small-business owner and customer.\n\u201cThe makers of these films and tellers of these stories know if this feels like overt advertising or gross product placement, people will tune out, so authenticity becomes a key metric here,\u201d Mr. Essex said. \u201cTraditional advertising tends to annoy people, and this makes the argument that you have to add value to people\u2019s lives rather than bombard them with a pitch and a hard sell, especially in a world of so much noisy content.\u201d\nA former chief executive of the creative agency Droga5, Mr. Essex helped introduce the award to encourage marketing that does not interrupt television programs or internet browsing and \u201cthat can attract an audience rather than repel an audience,\u201d he said.\nHe noted that it could be difficult to expose people to the films outside industry events, YouTube and Vimeo. This year, there will be a screening for the films at the festival, and they will appear on a special section of The Atlantic\u2019s website.\n\u201cA huge part of the reason readers come to The Atlantic is to understand, more broadly, what people are thinking about and why specific issues matter,\u201d said Hayley Romer, the publisher. \u201cBrands have the same opportunity to provide greater perspective for consumers for dramatic changes that are happening now and shaping their world.\u201d\nMs. Romer said companies were motivated to pursue such marketing because \u201cthe pinnacle of what you can be as a brand is a thought leader in the area in which you exist.\u201d\nThe Atlantic, like The New York Times, has an in-house studio that works with brands to develop content.\nThe jury that will select the winner this month includes figures like Jenna Lyons, the creative director of J. Crew; Joanna Coles, the chief content officer at Hearst; and Jae Goodman, the chief creative officer of CAA Marketing, a division of Creative Artists Agency.\nMr. Goodman said the same qualities that made for any great film applied to those from brands \u2014 though they do have a different goal.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same elements that make it a great, great story, that touches you, that sparks the right emotion, that gives you the same great response that an Oscar-winning movie would give you,\u201d Mr. Goodman said. \u201cHowever, it also needs to drive those brand and business results. If Coca-Cola makes a great feature film and doesn\u2019t sell more Coca-Cola, then that\u2019s a failure on Coca-Cola\u2019s part.\u201d\nHe said that the subtle nature of how brands might sway customers through storytelling and films was a fine line for marketers, and that criticism of it could be overblown.\n\u201cThe idea of being misled by marketers or tricked into choosing one brand over another comes up in this conversation a lot, and for what it\u2019s worth, I think it\u2019s a little bit unfair as long as the brand is straightforward about its role in the creation and distribution of the content,\u201d Mr. Goodman said.\nHe pointed to a children\u2019s show developed recently for Chipotle by the creators of \u201cYo Gabba Gabba!\u201d It is clear that it came from the company but is \u201ceducational entertainment to try to get kids and families to make better food choices,\u201d he said.\nFor the filmmakers and celebrities involved in such projects, the level of creative freedom and opportunity to be more than a face in a commercial can be particularly appealing, Mr. Essex said.\n\u201cThe old model was that you did an ad and you hoped no one would see it,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, the brands are to the point of asking, \u2018Do something more compelling and artistic,\u2019 and the talent is responding to that.\u201d\nMr. Essex said he viewed the Tribeca X Award as the early part of an evolution leading to brands pursuing programming in a bigger way, similar to initiatives in the mid-1900s from General Electric and Mutual of Omaha. He likened these efforts to the high end of a spectrum, where the low end is the automated buying of millions of online ads tailored to a person\u2019s interests and optimized for clicks and sales.\n\u201cThe brand will make the thing, not the thing that interrupts the thing, with shows and films in addition to the programmatic stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have that classic high and low but nothing in between.\u201d",

    "text": "Tom Price, Rohingya People, Elon Musk: Your Friday Evening Briefing\n2017-09-29T22:01:12.000Z\n(Want to get this briefing by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.)\nGood evening. Here\u2019s the latest.\n1. \u201cThis is not a good news story. This is a \u2018people are dying\u2019 story.\u201d\nThat was the mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, above left, after the acting head of Homeland Security said that she was \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with the government\u2019s response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.\nThe death toll stands at 16, though some experts say it\u2019s likely to rise. Conditions are growing increasingly desperate, with shortages of clean water, fuel and other basic necessities. The entire island of 3.4 million people remains without electricity, with little phone service. In this video, people in one of the hardest hit towns send messages to their loved ones.\nThe Homeland Security official, Elaine Duke, had said that \u201cit is really a good news story in terms of our ability to reach people.\u201d\n_____\n2. The State Department is pulling more than half its staff from the American Embassy in Havana \u2014 and warning American visitors of unusual risks \u2014 after mysterious attacks against diplomats.\nTwenty-one Americans associated with the embassy became ill, and some experts speculated that some kind of sonic weapon or faulty surveillance device may have been to blame. They suffered significant injuries, including hearing loss, dizziness, visual problems and cognitive issues.\nThere\u2019s a growing belief among American officials that Cuba is not behind whatever happened. It may have been another country \u2014 perhaps Russia \u2014 or a rogue government unit.\n_____\n3. President Trump stumped for his tax plan at a manufacturing industry convention in Washington, arguing it would be \u201crocket fuel\u201d to propel economic growth.\nA nonpartisan assessment found that the plan would benefit the wealthy and corporations the most. (Mr. Trump himself could save millions under the plan.) We collected the best writing from the right and left on the proposal.\nOn Capitol Hill, the Senate unveiled its budget blueprint, which would shield a $1.5 trillion tax cut from a Democratic filibuster \u2014 and could pave the way for oil drilling in the Arctic.\n_____\n4. Tom Price, the health and human services secretary who racked up at least $400,000 in chartered flights paid by taxpayers, resigned under pressure.\nMr. Price failed to defuse an uproar over his high-priced travel by agreeing to pay back $51,887. The announcement came hours after President Trump said he would decide whether to fire him by the end of the day.\n_____\n5. At least 500,000 Rohingya people have been forced out of Myanmar over the past month, and many are now living in desperate conditions in Bangladesh.\nOur reporter visited one of the muddy makeshift refugee camps and found children wandering around, searching for food and clothing.\nThe U.N. has said the expulsion of the Rohingya, by the Myanmar authorities and allied mobs employing brutal violence, amounts to ethnic cleansing. Here\u2019s how to help.\n_____\n6. In Bali, Indonesia, tens of thousands of people have also fled their homes \u2014 but out of fear that a volcano is about to erupt.\nThe 9,944-foot volcano, called Mount Agung, last erupted in the 1960s, destroying villages and killing nearly 2,000 people in mudflows and clouds of hot gases, lava fragments and ash. The authorities have warned people as far as 7.5 miles from the volcano to evacuate immediately.\n_____\n7. Catalans are set to vote on whether to secede from Spain on Sunday, and the central government is vowing to block them from casting ballots.\nWe went to a small city near Barcelona to get a better sense of what\u2019s motivating residents. Polls suggest about half will vote to break away. Many bitterly remember the years of the Franco dictatorship, when the regime tried to stamp out Catalan institutions and the language.\n\u201cAll my life, I had the dream of dying in an independent country,\u201d one man told us. \u201cIt was a dream that used to seem very remote. But now it is very near.\u201d\n_____\n8. The controversy over \u201ctaking a knee\u201d against racial injustice moved beyond the world of professional sports \u2014 and into high schools.\nOfficials in several school districts said they are requiring student athletes to stand during the national anthem.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union says such policies are unconstitutional. Above, the former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and two teammates last fall.\n_____\n9. Elon Musk unveiled a plan for rockets that could take colonists to Mars \u2014 and make trips to the moon and around Earth.\nThe SpaceX founder called it B.F.R. (The \u201cB\u201d stands for \u201cbig\u201d; the \u201cR\u201d is for \u201crocket\u201d) in a presentation at the International Astronautical Congress in Australia.\nIn other Musk family news, Elon\u2019s mother, Maye Musk, 69, is CoverGirl\u2019s latest brand ambassador. \u201cAging has been good for me,\u201d she told our reporter.\n_____\n10. Finally, \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d returns after a six-year hiatus for its ninth season on Monday. It was a pioneer in what has come to be known as \u201ccringe comedy.\u201d We traced the genre\u2019s evolution.\nOn the late-night shows, the hosts took stock of President Trump\u2019s new tax plan. \u201cI\u2019m starting to wonder if the only reason he ran for president was to lower his own taxes,\u201d Trevor Noah joked.\nHave a great weekend.\n_____\nYour Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.\nAnd don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a.m. Sundays.\nWant to catch up on past briefings?

    "text": "London, Japan, Cassini: Your Friday Evening Briefing\n2017-09-15T21:59:46.000Z\n(Want to get this briefing by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.)\nGood evening. Here\u2019s the latest.\n1. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the crude bomb that exploded on a crowded train in London this morning, leaving 29 injured. It was the fifth terrorist attack on Britain this year.\nThere has been longstanding concern that militants would target the London Underground, known as the Tube, as they did in 2005. The government raised the national threat level one notch to \u201ccritical,\u201d the highest.\n\u201cThis is terrifying and a reminder it can happen anywhere,\u201d said one woman who was on the train. \u201cNowhere is safe.\u201d\nAs the British authorities began their investigation, President Trump wrote on Twitter that the culprits were \u201csick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard.\u201d Prime Minister Theresa May quickly responded that it was not \u201chelpful for anybody to speculate\u201d on an open case.\n_____\n2. \u201cHe likes us. He likes me, anyway.\u201d That was Senator Chuck Schumer on his unlikely ally on immigration policy, President Trump.\nToday on our podcast \u201cThe Daily,\u201d our reporter describes how the two New Yorkers (and Nancy Pelosi) reached a deal on the DACA program over Chinese food.\nHow much more can the president\u2019s base take? That\u2019s the question on the right. We compiled the best writing on this strange week in Washington from across the political spectrum.\n_____\n3. North Korea launched yet another missile early Friday, its 15th this year. The missile flew over Japan, prompting alerts on cellphones and TV there. It also prompted a question: Why didn\u2019t the Japanese military shoot it down?\nOur Tokyo bureau chief set out to answer that question. In short, the country\u2019s missile defenses are limited, and the pacifist Constitution limits military action. Above, the reflection of a news broadcast in Tokyo.\n_____\n4. More than half the 400,000 Rohingya refugees who have fled Myanmar in the past three weeks are children, U.N. officials say. That includes more than a thousand children who have been separated from their families, putting them at particular risk in cramped, muddy camps in Bangladesh.\nThe U.N.\u2019s top official for human rights has called the military campaign against the Rohingya \u201ca textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\u201d Here are the basics about the crisis.\n_____\n5. Equifax\u2019s epic data breach has brought calls for greater oversight. But that\u2019s not likely to happen.\nThe credit bureaus have successfully fended off calls in Congress for more oversight for decades, despite warnings about potential problems. And their efforts are only intensifying. Equifax spent $1.1 million lobbying lawmakers last year, nearly four times what it spent a decade ago.\n_____\n6. Harvard revoked an invitation to Chelsea Manning to be a visiting fellow at the Kennedy School of Government. The school had faced harsh criticism for including Ms. Manning, the former Army private convicted of leaking classified information, in the program.\nMs. Manning tweeted that she was \u201chonored\u201d to be disinvited and that the institution was chilling \u201cmarginalized voices.\u201d Other fellows this year include Sean Spicer and Corey Lewandowski.\nAnd more than 1,000 readers commented on our story about Michelle Jones, who became a respected scholar while serving time for murder. She was accepted into a Ph.D. program at Harvard \u2014 but the school also rescinded that decision after questions were raised about her application.\n_____\n7. NASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft plunged into Saturn early this morning, ending its 20-year mission to expand what we know about the ringed planet.\nCassini\u2019s most surprising discovery was a small ocean containing carbon compounds, a key ingredient for life. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t just changed what we know about Saturn, but how we think about the world,\u201d said one scientist. Above, an engineer monitored the spacecraft from NASA\u2019s lab in Pasadena, Calif.\nNow that it\u2019s gone, here are the next space missions to watch out for.\n_____\n8. Tech is making its way into some Amish communities, pushing them \u2014 sometimes unwillingly \u2014 into the 21st century. We went to Lancaster, Pa., the epicenter of Amish life, to see how the Amish are adopting technology to run their small businesses.\nTheir newfound connectivity is raising concern about exposure to the wider world, and how that might impinge on the Amish way of life.\n_____\n9. \u201cFrozen,\u201d the Disney blockbuster that is now the highest grossing animated movie ever, is coming to Broadway. Our critic went to Denver, where the stage adaptation is doing a trial run.\nHe found it offers delights and difficulties, including the many younger audience members, some dressed in Elsa costumes, who sang along to \u201cLet It Go.\u201d\n\u201cThis was completely adorable but also a little strange,\u201d he reported. The Broadway version is scheduled to begin previews early next year.\n_____\n10. Finally, the late-night hosts reported some whiplash as they tried to keep track of President Trump\u2019s negotiations with Democrats on immigration. \u201cThe last time somebody changed positions that much on Twitter, Ted Cruz liked it,\u201d Seth Meyers joked.\nStephen Colbert will host the 69th Emmy Awards on Sunday. Winners in some categories were already announced, but we\u2019re still waiting for the big ones, including best drama, best comedy and the major acting categories. Above, preparations for the show. (8 p.m. Eastern, CBS.)\nHave a great weekend.\n_____\nYour Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.\nAnd don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a.m. Sundays.\nWant to catch up on past briefings?

    "text": "Michael Flynn, Tax Bill, Rex Tillerson: Your Evening Briefing\n2017-12-01T23:15:47.000Z\n(Want to get this briefing by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.)\nGood evening. Here\u2019s the latest.\n1. \u201cWe have the votes.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what Senator Mitch McConnell told reporters on Friday, and he appeared to be right: The Senate is now on the verge of passing the Republicans\u2019 sweeping tax overhaul. Check back for the latest updates.\nAn independent tax center said that the bill would add $1.2 trillion to federal deficits over 10 years, and we modeled taxes for 25,000 middle-class families to see how it would affect them. You can check this graphic to see how many people in your income group would get a tax cut.\nRepublicans say the bill will fuel investment and job creation. Critics say the only winners are the rich. We asked two economists to make their cases. And here\u2019s how to make sense of the bill itself.\n_____\n2. Michael Flynn, President Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about conversations with the Russian ambassador, and pledged to cooperate with the investigation into election meddling.\nHis decision to help could undercut arguments made by Mr. Trump and his aides that they were not fully aware of Mr. Flynn\u2019s discussion with the Russians. Court documents revealed new details about what the Trump team did know. Scrutiny is intensifying around Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law.\nThis video shows the events that led up to Mr. Flynn\u2019s guilty plea, and here are 10 key takeaways.\n_____\n3. President Trump scoffed at reports that he would soon fire Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, tweeting that they were \u201cfake news,\u201d and that \u201cI call the final shots.\u201d\nHis remarks came just hours after Mr. Tillerson flatly denied that Mr. Trump planned to replace him with the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, possibly by the end of the year.\nMr. Tillerson described the plan, which was told to our reporters by senior White House officials, as \u201claughable.\u201d\n_____\n4. In San Francisco, an undocumented Mexican immigrant was acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges in the killing of Kathryn Steinle, whose death was invoked by Mr. Trump as justification for his hard-line immigration agenda. After a five-week trial, the man was convicted only of being a felon in possession of a firearm.\nMs. Steinle\u2019s death on the city\u2019s Pier 14, above, also fed a fierce debate over whether immigrants without legal status \u2014 the shooter had been deported five times \u2014 should be dealt with more aggressively.\nMr. Trump called the verdict \u201cdisgraceful,\u201d and renewed his call to build a wall on the border with Mexico.\n_____\n5. More firings and scandals over sexual harassment accusations.\nVice Media sacked three employees for \u201cverbal and sexual harassment\u201d and it was revealed that a Texas lawmaker, Blake Farenthold, used $84,000 in taxpayer funds to settle a sexual harassment claim.\nRuben Kihuen, Democrat of Nevada, was also pulled in. His former campaign finance director told Buzzfeed that Mr. Kihuen repeatedly propositioned her for sex and touched her inappropriately.\nOur journalists have now analyzed all the apologies \u2014 and non-apologies \u2014 issued by the high-profile men accused of sexual misconduct.\n_____\n6. Pope Francis finally used the word \u201cRohingya.\u201d\nOn his last day in Bangladesh, the pope listened to the stories, and held the hands, one by one, of 16 Rohingya survivors of persecution in Myanmar, where he visited this week but did not utter the name.\nThe pope, in emotional remarks at a large interfaith gathering, above, asked for forgiveness \u201cfor the indifference of the world.\u201d\n_____\n7. Most of the planet is transfixed by the 2018 World Cup draw that took place today at the Kremlin, above. Here\u2019s our analysis. (Germany and Brazil are the current co-favorites.)\nIn the U.S., it\u2019s all about our kind of football, so here\u2019s a look at the weekend in the N.F.L. and a guide to the college playoff drama.\nAlso, Tiger Woods is back in action \u2014 and is so far playing well \u2014 at the Hero World Challenge.\n_____\n8. The original Seven Wonders of the World were laid out by Philo of Byzantium in 250 B.C., and of those ancient seven, only the pyramids remain.\nIt\u2019s a good thing that a new batch of Seven Wonders was selected in 2007. You can explore them all \u2014 the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal, Petra, the Colosseum, Christ the Redeemer, Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, above, and Machu Picchu \u2014 in this collection of 360 videos.\n_____\n9. The supermoon will be visible on Sunday, so let\u2019s start by explaining what exactly a supermoon is. For that matter, what\u2019s a blood moon, blue moon or strawberry moon?\nHere\u2019s a primer on the science and origins behind these lunar events. You can decide whether they are worth late nights or early mornings of moon-gazing.\n_____\n10. The weekend is finally here so here\u2019s a guide to the best TV shows and movies that are new to Netflix, Amazon and other streaming platforms. (Don\u2019t miss \u201cMy Happy Family,\u201d above, a drama from Georgia.)\nAnd, if you want to be a more informed citizen, here\u2019s our selection of 11 great weekend reads.\nFinally, the late-night host Stephen Colbert made it clear he doesn\u2019t think much of the Republican tax bill.\nHe even offered a new theory for its trickle-down economics: It\u2019s when rich people \u201cthrow their money in the air and dance underneath it for joy! Woo! Woo!\u201d\nHave a great night.\nYour Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.\nAnd don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a.m. Sundays.\nWant to catch up on past briefings?

Alternative for Germany, or AfD, became the first far-right party to enter parliament in more than 60 years.\nThe results suggest that populism \u2014 and anxieties over security and national identity \u2014 are far from dead in Europe. The shape and policies of a new governing coalition will involve weeks of painstaking negotiations.\nBut Ms. Merkel, and the country she leads, now have a major role around the world.\n_____\n\u2022 President Trump engaged in a war of words with the country\u2019s largest sports leagues, making the N.F.L.\u2019s game day one of the country\u2019s most political events of the year.\nTeams and owners presented a united front against Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism over the role athletes play in the country\u2019s race and social justice issues.

For the families who made it this far, the first challenge is food and water.\n_____\n\u2022 The telling problems of an oil middleman: We took a close look at Unaoil, a go-to agent for multinationals operating in the biggest oil patches on earth. Above, its chief operating officer, Saman Ahsani.\nIt\u2019s under investigation by Australia, Britain and the U.S. for possibly paying bribes in resource-rich countries, like Iraq and Libya, on behalf of a long list of companies.\n_____\n\u2022 The Pentagon introduced a $700 million program to destroy the Islamic State\u2019s increasingly lethal fleet of drones.

He challenged Britain\u2019s Prince Harry to fight.\n_____\n\u2022 Uber has successfully barreled into the cutthroat business of food delivery. UberEats sometimes eclipses Uber\u2019s main ride-hailing business in markets like Tokyo, Taipei and Seoul. Above, the service\u2019s San Francisco headquarters.\n\u2022 Facebook\u2019s response to Russian meddling in the U.S. election follows a pattern, our columnist writes: Mark Zuckerberg often fixes things after they\u2019ve broken, rather than preventing problems.\n\u2022 A backlash is building in Silicon Valley against the push for gender equality in tech.\n\u2022 Australia\u2019s four biggest banks are dropping cash withdrawal charges at A.T.M.s to lift their reputations after a series of scandals.\n\u2022 Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets.\n\u2022 Iraqi Kurds appear to be holding to their plan to vote on independence today, despite enormous pressure from Iraq, regional neighbors, and the U.S. over fears of violence that could tear the country apart. [The New York Times]\n\u2022 A \u201ctremendous increase\u201d in seismic activity has forced more than 35,000 people to flee Mount Agung, a Bali volcano that last erupted in 1963, killing 1,100 people. [Associated Press]\n\u2022 Three U.N. soldiers were killed and five others seriously injured by an explosion in Mali. As of Aug. 31, the four-year peacekeeping mission had recorded 133 fatalities.

A White House official said that \u201conly the president or his attorneys are authorized to comment\u201d on the matter.\nAnd Senate leaders said they had reached an agreement to impose new sanctions against Russia \u2014 which would place the White House in an uncomfortable position.\n_____\n\u2022 Taiwan is down to just 20 allies \u2014 19 countries and the Vatican \u2014 after Panama severed diplomatic relations in favor of recognizing China.\nThe move adds to Taiwan\u2019s isolation on the world stage and appears to put its last diplomatic relationships in doubt.\nAbove, Panama\u2019s foreign minister, left, and her Chinese counterpart on Tuesday in Beijing.\n_____\n\u2022 President Trump is close to adding six new trademarks to his portfolio in China, renewing deep concerns about his potential conflicts of interest.

    "text": "Donald Trump, \u2018Brexit,\u2019 Israel: Your Friday Briefing\n2017-01-06T05:00:52.000Z\nGood morning.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\n\u2022 The friction between American intelligence agencies and Donald J. Trump\u2019s incoming administration is worsening.\nAt a Senate committee hearing, the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., above, criticized the \u201cdisparagement\u201d of the intelligence community over its findings that Russia interfered in the presidential election. Bolstered by the support of senators from both parties, he will brief Mr. Trump today.\nMr. Trump is expected to name retired Senator Dan Coats, a former ambassador to Germany, to replace Mr. Clapper as early as today.\n_____\n\u2022 Diplomats say that Mr. Trump\u2019s transition staff has broken with decades of precedent by requiring politically appointed ambassadors to leave their overseas posts by Inauguration Day, threatening to leave the U.S. without Senate-confirmed envoys for months in critical nations like Germany and Britain.\nA joint session of Congress today is to officially name Mr. Trump the 45th president of the United States.\nHuman rights experts worry that if the incoming president keeps his campaign promises to reinstate the sort of torture used in the Bush-era war on terrorism, authoritarian regimes around the world would see a green light to carry out abuses. Above, a detainee at Guant\u00e1namo.\n_____\n\u2022 Turkey suffered yet another terrorist attack, this one attributed to Kurdish militants. A police officer and a court worker, as well as the two attackers, were killed in a car bomb and gun assault on a courthouse in the city of Izmir.\nA senior Turkish official said the country had asked President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s team to reconsider U.S. support to Syrian Kurdish forces.\n_____\n\u2022 C\u00e9dric Herrou has become something of a folk hero in France for resisting the state and taking a stand: that it is simply right to help migrants seeking a better life. Mr. Herrou is facing prison for operating a loosely knit underground railroad to smuggle migrants north, many destined for Britain or Germany.\nA court in the southern French city of Nice is expected to issue a verdict today on charges of aiding illegal migrants against a university lecturer accused of giving a ride to three female Eritreans.\n_____\n\u2022 China intends to spend more than $360 billion through 2020 on renewable power sources like solar and wind.\n\u2022 France started slaughtering ducks in the main foie gras-producing region to try to contain a dangerous form of bird flu.\n\u2022 Ford Motor\u2019s announcement that it would incorporate Amazon\u2019s Alexa into its vehicles is but one of many recent efforts by automakers to improve voice-recognition systems.\n\u2022 The final U.S. jobs report for 2016, due today, is expected to extend the country\u2019s longest streak of job growth on record.\n\u2022 Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets.\n\u2022 A 47-year-old Greek anarchist considered the country\u2019s most-wanted terrorist, above, has been arrested in an Athens suburb. [The New York Times]\n\u2022 A Turkish court sentenced two officers accused of participating in a failed coup in July to life in prison. [Hurriyet]\n\u2022 Anis Amri, the Tunisian man accused of driving a truck into a Berlin Christmas market, killing 12 people, had used 14 aliases, the police in Germany said. [BBC]\n\u2022 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was questioned a second time by the police about potentially improper gifts and favors. [The New York Times]\n\u2022 The U.S. named Hamza bin Laden, a son of Osama bin Laden, a \u201cglobal terrorist\u201d in an effort to hamper his movements and transactions. [The New York Times]\n\u2022 The police in Bangladesh said that they had killed one of the trainers who guided a team of militants through the brutal siege of a restaurant in Dhaka last year. [The New York Times]\n\u2022 Britain sent envoys to Washington to improve ties with the incoming Trump administration and prepare for Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s visit in the spring. [The Guardian]\n\u2022 And senior British civil servants have called for higher pay to compensate for \u201cunsustainable\u201d workloads caused by the country\u2019s plans to leave the European Union. [Press Association]\n\u2022 Frank Ntilikina, an 18-year-old from France, is widely considered the best prospect in European basketball and one of the most intriguing players expected to be available in the N.B.A. draft this summer.\n\u2022 U.S. health experts, in a major reversal, called for parents to give their children foods containing peanuts, starting in infancy, to help ward off life-threatening peanut allergies.\n\u2022 Movie awards season kicks into high gear on Sunday with the Golden Globes, and Oscar voting is underway. Here is our podcast discussion of four films you should know about: \u201cFences,\u201d \u201cPassengers,\u201d \u201cLa La Land\u201d and \u201cPatriots Day.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cAre my thoughts helping to build me up, or tear me down?\u201d A psychologist asks this question to help overcome negativity. Controlled breathing may help, too. Here are more bits of advice.\n\u2022 In 2017, art lovers can look forward to splashy new museums and exhibitions: The Louvre\u2019s outpost in Abu Dhabi will open, London\u2019s Victoria & Albert Museum is getting a $50-million-plus upgrade, and the British Library is commemorating the 20th anniversary of the inception of the world\u2019s most famous wizard, Harry Potter.\nWe have begun the new year with political upheavals spreading across nearly every continent. But 100 years ago, several seismic shifts shaped our modern world.\nAs World War I raged, the monarchy in Russia was collapsing, leading to the formation of the Soviet Union a few years later.\nFinland gained its independence as a result. It\u2019s celebrating the anniversary with new passports and special blankets for newborns. The state of Israel hadn\u2019t been created by then, but the British foreign secretary\u2019s \u201cBalfour Declaration\u201d laid the diplomatic foundation for the state of Israel.\nThe United States entered what was then known as the Great War, a milestone in its rise toward becoming a superpower. One lawmaker who voted against sending troops was a historical figure. Jeannette Rankin took office in 1917 as the country\u2019s first woman in Congress. She later helped pass the 19th Amendment, giving women voting rights.\nNot all of this year\u2019s centennials, though, are tied to war and politics.\nIn 1917, the United States gave a Swedish immigrant a patent for his \u201cseparable fastener,\u201d also known as a zipper. And a Massachusetts resident tinkering in his kitchen concocted something that you might eat for dessert tonight that includes sugar, egg whites and vanilla.\nIt\u2019s known today as Marshmallow Fluff.\n_____\nYour Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings.\nWhat would you like to see here?

    "text": "New York Today: An Ella Fitzgerald Centennial\n2017-04-25T10:07:55.000Z\nUpdated, 10:38 a.m.\nGood morning on this spongy Tuesday.\nNew Jersey Transit trains are running up to 45 minutes late into and out of Pennsylvania Station. Amtrak trains are running with delays of up to 35 minutes into and out of Penn Station.\nToday would have been Ella Fitzgerald\u2019s 100th birthday.\nOne New Yorker, Loren Schoenberg, played saxophone alongside the \u201cFirst Lady of Song\u201d in 1990, near the very end of her career. He compared her to \u201ca vintage bottle of wine\u201d and told us that \u201cshe had none of the characteristics of a star\u201d because of her gracious, humble demeanor.\nMs. Fitzgerald was born in Virginia, but she discovered her voice in New York.\nShe spent her childhood in Yonkers before moving to Harlem, which at the time had a series of talent contests for aspiring artists. Among these shows were the famous amateur nights at the Apollo, where Ms. Fitzgerald entered her first competition in 1934 \u2014 and won.\nShe began performing shortly afterward with Chick Webb\u2019s band. Her voice soon echoed from the Savoy Ballroom on Lenox Avenue up in Harlem down to what was then known as Swing Street \u2014 an area around 52nd Street that was home to Birdland Jazz Club, the Royal Roost (nicknamed the Metropolitan Bopera House), and the original Roseland Ballroom.\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked with a lot of great singers, and a lot of them are divas,\u201d said Mr. Schoenberg, 58, a musician and the founding director of the National Jazz Museum in Harlem.\n\u201cBut with Ella, I\u2019ll never forget how she just came out dressed very modestly and sat down on a stool in front of the band. She just matter-of-factly ran down the program with great professionalism, said hello to some of the guys in the band, and that was it.\u201d\nShe\u2019d then emerge onto the stage before thousands of people, \u201cas effortlessly as you or I would get in an elevator,\u201d Mr. Schoenberg recalled of that show in 1990, when he was playing in the Benny Carter band, with Ms. Fitzgerald, at Radio City Music Hall.\n\u201cAnd there was something about her voice \u2014 a purity about her intonation and her range and her style \u2014 that made musicians react to her like we could react to Pablo Casals, Jessye Norman or Yo-Yo Ma.\u201d\nMs. Fitzgerald died at her Beverly Hills, Calif., home in 1996. She was 79.\nYou can celebrate Ella Fitzgerald\u2019s centennial with concerts this evening (8:30 p.m. and 11 p.m.) at Birdland, or Thursday through Saturday at Lincoln Center. You can learn more about her legacy through the National Jazz Museum, or try your hand at an Ella-centric crossword puzzle from The New York Times.\nHere\u2019s what else is happening:\nStep outside and you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re clingin\u2019 to a cloud. With a high of 56.\nRain will come and go \u2014 and come again \u2014 for the next two days.\nAs they say, into each life a little rain must fall. But sun is on its way, probably around Thursday, when cozy temperatures return.\n\u2022 Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city would offer free, full-day preschool to all 3-year-olds within four years.

Here\u2019s the sign-up.)\nGood morning.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\n\u2022 Trump appoints new national security adviser.\nPresident Trump announced on Monday that Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster would be his new national security adviser, replacing Michael T. Flynn, who was asked to resign after he misled officials about contacts with Russia\u2019s ambassador.\nGeneral McMaster is widely respected and is credited with helping to turn around the Iraq war.\nHis selection followed a report in The Times about two of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates working on a peace plan for Ukraine and Russia. They have no experience in foreign policy, and their \u201cdiplomatic freelancing\u201d infuriated Ukrainian officials.\n\u2022 Taking on a foe of political unity.\nIf East Stratcom sounds like a group tasked with devising plans to win wars, that\u2019s not far-off. The 11-member team is serving as Europe\u2019s front line against fake news.\nSeparately, Mr. Trump claimed that Sweden was experiencing a crisis because of immigration. During a rally over the weekend, he suggested that a terrorist attack had occurred there the night before. Swedish officials were baffled.\n\u2022 Bumpy recess for Congress.\nSome lawmakers are holding town hall-style meetings with their constituents over the break, providing a testing ground of political divisions.\nThe events, which have been contentious at times during discussions of the Affordable Care Act, may signal how much latitude voters will give to defenders of the president.\nOur reporters will be covering four town hall meetings today, including one by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa.\n\u2022 Breeding ground for ISIS.\nTrinidad and Tobago is scrambling to stop young Muslims from going to Syria to take up arms for the Islamic State.\nPer capita, the Caribbean island nation has the largest number of foreign fighters from the Western Hemisphere who have joined the militant group, the former U.S. ambassador there said.\n\u2022 The Daily, your audio news report.\nThe source of recent government leaks could define this new presidency as much as the president himself.\nListen from a computer, on an iOS device or on an Android device.\n\u2022 There were 2,473 billionaires in 2015, 6.4 percent more than a year earlier, by a new count. The top 10 \u2014 nine from the U.S., one from Spain \u2014 have a combined net worth of $582 billion.\n\u2022 Elitism is alive in Britain, and it\u2019s not just over accents: A new report points to pay disparities linked to class.\n\u2022 \u201cThe Lego Batman Movie\u201d again topped the North American box office, while \u201cThe Great Wall\u201d had a disappointing showing.\n\u2022 U.S. markets were closed for Presidents\u2019 Day. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets.\n\u2022 Millions of people in South Sudan are in urgent need of food, the U.N. warned, citing the country\u2019s war and collapsing economy as reasons for the famine.\n\u201cOur worst fears have been realized,\u201d an official said.\n\u2022 Vice President Mike Pence was in Brussels on Monday, and he tried to reassure the European Union of American support.\n\u2022 Norma McCorvey, the anonymous plaintiff in Roe v. Wade, died in Texas at age 69. The landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion in the U.S. also reshaped the nation\u2019s social and political landscapes.\n\u2022 Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations known for his caustic, dry wit, died at work on Monday. He was 64.\n\u2022 We\u2019re in Week 4 of our New Year\u2019s resolutions month, helping you stick to your goals. There\u2019s still time to join.\nWhether you recommitted to a resolution or started a new one, you may be wavering \u2014 and that\u2019s O.K.! What\u2019s most important is forgiving yourself for slip-ups and getting back to it.\nSo we\u2019re giving you permission to move on. Research suggests that \u201cgiving ourselves a break and accepting our imperfections may be the first step toward better health.\u201d\nIf you\u2019ve gotten off track, tell us what happened.\n\u2022 Recipe of the day: Like bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches? You\u2019ll love breakfast carbonara.\n\u2022 The death of Malcolm X.\nThe civil rights leader was killed on this day in 1965 at a rally in New York City. Hear from a witness and visit the site of the assassination in our latest 360 video.\n\u2022 Rise of Alex Jones.\nMr. Jones \u201cis the conspiracy-theorizing, flame-throwing nationalistic radio and internet star,\u201d and an occasional source and validator for the president, our media columnist writes.\nBut in his early years as a broadcaster, he is said to have worked out of a spare bedroom \u201cwith choo-choo wallpaper.\u201d\n\u2022 How well do we know the cosmos?\nA crisis may be brewing: The universe seems to be expanding too fast, some astronomers say.\n\u2022 Best of late-night TV.\nMost hosts took a break for the holiday, but Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers spent it roasting the president.\nToday the U.N. is celebrating International Mother Language Day. Started in 2000, it is a day to celebrate linguistic diversity and draw attention to endangered and defunct languages.\nAn event 65 years ago this week was the inspiration. Students in Dhaka \u2014 then the capital of East Pakistan, now Bangladesh \u2014 demanded that the government designate Bengali as an official language. Violence broke out, and the police opened fire on the demonstrators, killing at least six, according to an article in The Times in 1952.\nThere are around 3,000 endangered languages, some of them dialects, according to an estimate by the U.N.\u2019s cultural body, Unesco. Extinction occurs when the last known speaker dies. That was the case when Alban Michael, a speaker of a dialect of Nuu-chah-nulth in British Columbia, Canada, died last year. Vancouver Island, where Mr. Michael lived, is particularly rich in dialects.\nMultilingual education is the focus of International Mother Language Day this year. \u201cEducation and information in the mother language is absolutely essential to improving learning and developing confidence and self-esteem,\u201d the director-general of Unesco said.\nA Twitter post last week by Unesco was even more emphatic: \u201c#Languages are who we are. Protecting this identity is a matter of human rights!\u201d\nPalko Karasz and Sandra E. Garcia contributed reporting.\n_____\nPhotographs may appear out of order for some readers.

Standing next to the de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, and before military officials, prelates, and diplomats, he avoided directly addressing the situation of the persecuted Rohingya minority, or even mentioning their name.\nHe celebrates Mass in Yangon today before an expected crowd of 200,000 and is to meet with Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh later in the week. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi heads on Thursday to China, which has been offering mediation efforts.\n_____\n\u2022 North Korea conducted first missile test in more than two months, escalating tensions in a standoff with the U.S. and its allies. Within minutes, South Korea fired a missile to demonstrate its ability to strike the North\u2019s launch sites.\nThe exchange came after a senior South Korean official warned that the North was working on being able to launch nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles as early as next year.\nThe U.S. Pacific island state of Hawaii is bringing back its Cold War-era nuclear warning system.\n_____\n\u2022 In Washington, Republicans are scrambling to pass their tax code overhaul, which party leaders hope to bring to the Senate floor for a vote by Friday. We\u2019re following the events in real time.\nThe two top Democrats skipped a planned meeting with President Trump to try to avert a government shutdown after he posted on Twitter this morning \u201cI don\u2019t see a deal!\u201d\nA day earlier, Mr. Trump transformed a White House ceremony to honor Navajo veterans of World War II into a racially charged controversy. (Watch it here.)\n_____\n\u2022 A senior Chinese general who was under investigation for bribery was found dead in his home in Beijing.

    "text": "Myanmar General\u2019s Purge of Rohingya Lifts His Popular Support\n2017-11-26T18:57:43.000Z\nYANGON, Myanmar \u2014 The most powerful person in Myanmar now, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, was little known outside the country\u2019s military circles until the villages started burning.\nWithin just a few weeks in 2009, his forces drove tens of thousands of people out of two ethnic enclaves in eastern Myanmar \u2014 first the Shan, near the Thai border, then the Kokang, closer to China. Locals accused his soldiers of murder, rape and systematic arson.\nTwo years later, the general, who was meeting with Pope Francis on Monday, was promoted to commander-in-chief of the armed forces in a country where the Constitution keeps the military in power despite the veneer of democratic elections.\nThe methods his forces used in 2009 have all been on display this year as the military has driven more than 620,000 Rohingya Muslims out of Myanmar in a campaign the United States has declared to be  ethnic cleansing.\nDaw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate who is the country\u2019s de facto civilian leader, has been harshly criticized for allowing the Rohingya\u2019s expulsion. But under the Constitution, which was written by the military, she has no authority over the armed forces.\nThat is solely the province of General Min Aung Hlaing, 61.\nHis campaign against the Rohingya has further cemented his status, creating an air of crisis that has galvanized support both within the ranks and the country\u2019s Buddhist majority.\n\u201cThey are pinching themselves,\u201d David Scott Mathieson, an analyst in Yangon, said about the military leadership. \u201cThey hit the jackpot. They are six years into the democracy era, and they are more popular than in decades.\u201d\nGeneral Min Aung Hlaing has effectively sidelined Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, whose electoral landslide in 2015 blocked a potential path for him to become president of Myanmar, also known as Burma. She is barred in the Constitution from becoming president and heads the government under the title she created, \u201cstate counselor.\u201d\nShe and the general rarely meet or speak to each other. And as his military offensive continues, it is deeply undermining Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s international standing.\n\u201cAung San Suu Kyi and her government are a human shield for the military against international and domestic criticism,\u201d said Mark Farmaner, director of the London-based Burma Campaign U.K.\nGeneral Min Aung Hlaing\u2019s power includes appointing three key cabinet members, overseeing the police and border guards, and presiding over two large business conglomerates. He fills a quarter of Parliament\u2019s seats, enough to block any constitutional amendment that would limit his authority.\nThe general makes occasional public appearances and often posts on social media about his high-level meetings. Mostly, though, he asserts his power quietly from behind closed doors. People who know him are reluctant to talk publicly about his character or their conversations. He declined to speak to The New York Times.\nInterviews with more than 30 people, including current and former military officers, rights activists, analysts, diplomats and legal experts, paint a portrait of a thoughtful strategist who has used his power to promote a starkly nationalist agenda.\nNow, many expect he will try in coming elections to again put a general in the presidency: himself.\n\u201cHis plan is to become president in 2020,\u201d said U Win Htein, an adviser to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and a leader in her party, the National League for Democracy.\nMin Aung Hlaing grew up in central Rangoon, now Yangon, where his father was a construction ministry official.\nAfter high school, the future general studied law. But his dream was to attend the Defense Services Academy, the surest route to success for a young man during a half-century of military rule. He passed the entrance exam on his third try, said his childhood friend, U Hla Oo, a writer who lives in Australia.\nThe future general was known for his smile, but his tendency to criticize and blame others won him few friends. His contemporaries gave him a nickname meaning cat feces, an especially vulgar epithet in Burmese, said three former military members, including Mr. Win Htein.\nOne fellow cadet recalled in a 2011 radio interview that the young Min Aung Hlaing liked to bully the newer students.\n\u201cWe were so afraid of him,\u201d recalled U Aung Lynn Htut, who became an intelligence officer and diplomat before defecting to the United States. \u201cWhenever we walked by in front of him, he always loved to find fault. So we always tried our best to keep away from him.\u201d\nMin Aung Hlaing graduated in 1977 and became an infantry officer in a military whose existence had largely been defined by its wars against ethnic minorities. It waged a ruthless counterinsurgency strategy known as the \u201cFour Cuts,\u201d isolating rebels from civilian support by violently severing their access to food, money, intelligence and recruits.\n\u201cBurning villages is what they have done for years,\u201d Mr. Mathieson said. \u201cHe would have risen in the ranks in the \u201980s when this was happening all the time.\u201d\nMr. Hla Oo wrote  about the record of \u201cmy dear friend Min Aung Hlaing,\u201d saying, \u201cHe truly is a battle-hardened warrior of brutal Burmese Army.\u201d\nOne of his commanding officers, Mr. Hla Oo said, was a colonel named Than Shwe, who later became senior general and head of the ruling clique.\nIn early 2009, Min Aung Hlaing was named chief of the Bureau of Special Operations-2, overseeing northeastern Myanmar. In July and August that year, his troops targeted rebels in Shan State campaigns that drove nearly 50,000 people from their homes.\n\u201cThis campaign has been carried out coldbloodedly and systematically,\u201d Kham Harn Fah, director of the Shan Human Rights Foundation, said at the time. \u201cThe troops commandeered petrol to burn down the houses, and radioed repeatedly to their headquarters as the buildings went up in flames.\u201d\nThe assault in the Kokang region of northern Shan State began after the military, known as the Tatmadaw, tried to arrest a popular Kokang leader, Pheung Kya-shin. Fighting erupted, dozens were killed and 37,000 refugees fled into China. Mr. Pheung accused soldiers of robbing, raping and killing civilians.\nIn March 2011, Senior Gen. Than Shwe bypassed older and more experienced generals and picked Min Aung Hlaing, then a young lieutenant general, as commander-in-chief.\nHis selection was part of the junta leader\u2019s plan to restructure the government under the new Constitution. Then in his mid-70s, Than Shwe needed a trusted successor who would not hold him accountable in retirement for his brutal reign or his accumulation of personal wealth.\nThan Shwe put two other top generals into civilian positions, including Thein Sein as president, and dissolved the junta in 2011.\nIn 2013, Min Aung Hlaing took on the title of senior general previously held by his mentor. It is unclear who promoted him.\nMin Aung Hlaing was in line to succeed Thein Sein in the presidency, but that plan was foiled by Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s overwhelming victory in 2015.\nAfter the election, he decided to stay on past the mandatory retirement age of 60 for five more years, despite complaints that the move was improper.\nAs commander-in-chief, he has acted much like a head of state, traveling to meet foreign leaders and arms suppliers, and holding court in Naypyidaw, the capital, with ambassadors and visiting dignitaries.\n\u201cHe pays attention to detail,\u201d said U Min Zin, executive director of the Institute for Strategy and Policy Myanmar, an independent center in Yangon that promotes democracy. \u201cHe is good at delegating; he presents himself as a statesman.\u201d\nOn Twitter and Facebook, he extols fitness and discipline, complains of \u201cbullying\u201d by foreign organizations, and accuses the international media of \u201chiding the truth\u201d about Rohingya refugees. Like other nationalists, he calls them \u201cBengalis\u201d and insists they are illegal immigrants.\n\u201cThere is exaggeration to say that the number of Bengalis fleeing to Bangladesh is very large,\u201d he posted in English on Facebook after meeting with United States Ambassador Scot Marciel in October.\nThe two countries said last week that they had reached an \u201carrangement\u201d on the possible repatriation of the Rohingya, but they gave few details.\nThe military\u2019s edge in Myanmar is not an accident. The generals spent more than 15 years drafting their Constitution, instituting a byzantine government structure with many built-in powers for the commander-in-chief.\nSince Parliament selects the president, the commander-in-chief\u2019s control of a quarter of the seats gives him a big head start in any future contest.\nHe has extensive authority over local civilian affairs through his control of the Ministry of Home Affairs and its General Administration Department. \u201cThat means day-to-day administration of the country is under the military,\u201d said U Yan Myo Thein, an independent analyst in Yangon.\nThe general also oversees an extensive intelligence apparatus, unlike Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who at times seems poorly informed about events in the country.\nAnd the military owns two of Myanmar\u2019s largest conglomerates, the Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited and Myanmar Economic Corporation.\nThose secretive companies operate in many sectors, including jade mining, energy, banking, insurance, telecommunications, transportation, tourism and information technology, analysts say.\nHistorically, they have been an important source of wealth for the generals, said U Ye Myo Hein, executive director of the Tagaung Institute of Political Studies, an independent policy center in Yangon.\n\u201cThey have a vast economic empire,\u201d he said. \u201cHe does not have to answer to Parliament or the civilian government. We have a long history of the business-military complex. It is very difficult to stop that.\u201d\nMost land in Myanmar is owned by the government, and the generals have a history of seizing desirable properties and handing them to favored companies, including their own. The commander-in-chief also has authority over many land-use decisions through the Ministry of Home Affairs.\n\u201cHe controls everything that has to do with the land,\u201d said U Myint Thwin, a lawyer who represents farmers trying to recover 20,000 acres outside Yangon that the military seized two decades ago. Twenty farmers were jailed for months in 2014 after they filed a lawsuit seeking the land\u2019s return.\nHe said he and the farmers sent letters last year to General Min Aung Hlaing asking him to give back the land.\n\u201cThe military people were calling the farmers and threatening them.\u201d he said. \u201cThe military sent me a letter saying, \u2018If you don\u2019t withdraw the letter, we will sue you for defamation.\u2019 \u201d\nSome activists fear that the general will declare the abandoned Rohingya villages vacant and give the property to other ethnic groups, making it harder for the refugees to return.\nIn September, the general visited Maungdaw, a town in northern Rakhine State on the border with Bangladesh, and lamented in a speech that the Rohingya had been more successful in business than other ethnic groups.\nHe urged non-Rohingya who had fled the violence to return home and rebuild their communities.\n\u201cIt\u2019s necessary to have control of our region with our national races,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is their rightful place.\u201d",

(The automaker wants to develop fully autonomous cars for highway use by 2021.)\n\u2022 The U.S., once the World Trade Organization\u2019s biggest supporter, has turned into its biggest skeptic.\n\u2022 A notable quote in our latest Brexit update comes from David Davis, Britain\u2019s negotiator: \u201cI don\u2019t have to be very clever,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to know that much. I just do have to be calm.\u201d\n\u2022 Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets.\n\u2022 The photographer who captured a now-viral photo of a starving polar bear in the Arctic recalled the experience: \u201cAs soon as he did a slow stand on his feet, everybody on the team just started crying.\u201d [The New York Times]\n\u2022 Emmanuel Macron, the French president, is hosting an international summit meeting in Paris to increase funding for efforts to mitigate climate change.

    "text": "Trauma, Then Triumph: The New York Times College Scholarship Winners\n2017-03-08T17:08:40.000Z\nJust one year ago, while serving chai lattes and gluten-free waffles to customers at one of Manhattan\u2019s trendiest cafes, McKenna Montgomery was living on secret cups of soup.\nMs. Montgomery used her cafe wages to keep herself and her father afloat. Living in poverty and surrounded by drug use, she battled hunger and depression.\n\u201cI\u2019d have to go days without eating because I couldn\u2019t afford to buy food,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I would get to work, and the first thing I would do is put some soup in a little cup, so it\u2019d look like it was coffee.\u201d\nMs. Montgomery, now 18, has set her sights on a bright future. She is one of 10 students chosen this year by the New York Times College Scholarship Program, which means she will get $15,000 in financial assistance for every year of college, as well as mentoring and internship opportunities with The New York Times Company.\nThe program, which began in 1999 and is financeed by reader donations, has helped put hundreds of students through school, including many at top-tier institutions such as Harvard University, New York University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nOn a recent trip to the New York Times building, Ms. Montgomery gathered with the nine other scholarship winners in a conference room with a bird\u2019s-eye view of Midtown Manhattan, where they posed for photographs, listened to advice about university life and shared their stories.\nMany said they had never known stability, describing childhoods bouncing between foster homes and homeless shelters. Some told how their families had struggled with mental illness, drug abuse or incarceration.\nBut all of the students boasted noteworthy academic achievements, often in addition to work, internships and participation in after-school clubs.\nFaa Diallo, 17, is engaged in a good-natured battle with his best friend to see who will be crowned class valedictorian this year \u2014 a tall order for any student, let alone one whose life was upended by violence.\nMr. Diallo, his mother and four siblings fled to a domestic violence shelter when he was 13. After that, he said, \u201cI started acting like I was the father figure,\u201d and got his first job in ninth grade.\nWhenever Mr. Diallo needed an escape, he turned to Greek mythology. His favorite character was Perseus, a demigod who was cast out to sea with his mother and dedicated himself to protecting her. \u201cThese fictional characters began to be my role models because they could do things that I couldn\u2019t do in the real world,\u201d he said.\nAnother one of this year\u2019s winners, Chaim Fishman, 19, has already been accepted to the University of Pennsylvania. To him, the opportunity is precious. Growing up in a very conservative Hasidic community, Mr. Fishman read only religious texts and spoke nothing but Yiddish. He summoned up the courage to leave his yeshiva at age 15, defying the expectations of nearly all of his friends and family.\nNow he is excelling at a public school, fascinated by science \u2014 especially the big-picture questions, like how the mind works and the origins of the universe.\n\u201cAll those years when I wanted to learn, I wasn\u2019t able to,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the anticipation built up.\u201d\nDriven as they are to succeed, many of this year\u2019s winners also cited the importance of giving back \u2013 to family members, to friends and even to total strangers.\n\u201cI know I want to do something that will help people,\u201d said Shafqat Shadaab, 17. He moved to the United States from Bangladesh at the age of 9 with his mother, who had glaucoma. When he was 14, his uncle, a father figure, died of leukemia. So Mr. Shadaab devoted himself to his mother, taking on a caretaker role while earning sky-high marks in school.\nBariki Innis, 18, said his life was turned upside down twice: first when he moved to the United States from Jamaica at 14 and lost touch with his father, and then again at 15, when his mother was struck by a car, leaving her disabled. Having watched his mother struggle with mobility, the star student now dreams of becoming an innovator in the field of driverless cars.\nIn her scholarship application, Laura Chen, 18, wrote of a harrowing experience witnessing the onset of mental illness in a loved one. That challenge became a lesson in compassion, she said, leading her to start a club to raise awareness of child trafficking. \u201cOnce you undergo some type of struggle, you start you empathize with other people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just an urge to help people.\u201d\nSome of the scholarship winners were hesitant to talk about their struggles, explaining how shame over their families\u2019 circumstances had blossomed into a sort of protective pride.\nJohn Park, 17, said that the older he got, the more admired his mother and father for teaching him the values of hard work and sacrifice. Vanessa Rodriguez, 17, spent her childhood bouncing between shelters, where she watched her mother fend off sleep to stand guard over her family\u2019s few possessions; none of it stopped her from studying or holding down jobs. Rieanna Duncan, 17, shrank into herself when she talked about the wrenching loss of her father when she was in fourth grade, but was expansive about her hobbies, which include poetry, wrestling and rock music.\nThe winners said that they know the scholarship does not mean the end of their struggles. Many still do not have secure housing. Some are estranged from their families. All of them wonder how they will fit in at college, surrounded by peers from more privileged backgrounds.\nLeslieann Gomez, 17, said she would not let college distract her from her mother and sister. She is fiercely protective of her family, which has struggled to stay afloat for as long as she can remember.\nBut Ms. Gomez\u2019s face lights up when she describes her own interests: robotics, Korean pop music and self-taught break dancing. The joy of mastering certain moves \u2013 the tut, the pop-and-lock \u2013 helped her survive a childhood tainted by abuse, hunger and poverty.\n\u201cThey seem like impossible moves, but if you keep practicing, it\u2019s really cool,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will be amazed by you.\u201d",

    "text": "Aussie Rules: Readers Respond\n2017-10-11T23:51:41.000Z\nDamien Cave, our Australia bureau chief, shares insights on global news, local recommendations and feedback from readers in this weekly newsletter. To receive it in your inbox, sign up here.\n______\nLast week\u2019s newsletter on Australia\u2019s rule-following ways brought in a wide range of responses and anecdotes.\nSome of you, of course, focused on my lead anecdote involving kangaroos and the family that was feeding them white bread (yes, we know, it\u2019s bad for the animals).\nOthers replied with stories of their own about Australia\u2019s relationship to rules, many of which made us smile and think even more deeply about how this country works \u2014 which is exactly what we\u2019d hoped for, and what we always appreciate here in the Australia bureau.\nHere are a few of the more memorable replies, lightly edited for space and clarity, followed by a roundup of Times stories we love and a recommendation for those who might be wondering what to do with their lives.\nShare this newsletter widely, add your voice (via our Facebook group or nytaustralia@nytimes.com) \u2014 and always throw the shark out of the pool.\nOur society is, in my opinion, well above average when it comes to rigidity compared to other Western democracies. We set rules and associated punishments for any wrongdoing we can predict.\nYou only have to look at driving signs in Sydney to see that. It takes a minute to read them. I think it might even be illegal to read them, such are the risks to your health and other road users\u2019 health.\nWho decides the rules, and who are the \u2018risky\u2019 subjects? You mentioned those of overseas cultures, but I would add Indigenous Australians and drug addicts to the mix. So often rules are made that make middle-class mums and dads feel safer and more assured, even though they and their families were rarely, if ever, affected by the activities the rules limit or outlaw.\n\u2014 Ned Cooper\nI\u2019m really surprised at your impression re. rule breakers versus rule followers. I break every rule under the sun, have done so all my life (I\u2019m 66) and I think that pretty much all my peers do the same. So I guess it\u2019s a matter of perception.\n\u2014 Neil Bolton\nI had a two-month job as a visiting professor in the United States a couple of years back. The rules to get in for a non-American were astounding. As as woman of more than 70 years I had to insure myself against pregnancy, among other things, in order to be approved. I raised this as a patent absurdity and was told, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not discrimination, men have to get the same insurance.\nThe rule under no condition could be waived.\n\u2014 Bronwyn Davies\nI\u2019m Australian and I\u2019ve lived in Sydney for all 27 years of my life, though I like to think I am well traveled \u2014 don\u2019t we all? I\u2019m also a lawyer.\nThe reason Australians are sticklers for the rules, and the reason they are so hesitant to stray, is that they absolutely abhor the concept of personal responsibility in a way few other countries do.\nIf something goes wrong, it\u2019s not the person\u2019s fault. Rather, it\u2019s that the regulatory framework for that arena of human behavior isn\u2019t effective enough. More laws! Won\u2019t someone please think of the children.\nThe best example I can think of was when, following a drunken man drowning in Circular Quay, the government proposed a fence. People actually agreed! Because of one drunk man. More mundane examples abound.\nIt is, in my opinion, one of the more distasteful aspects of Australian society.\n\u2014 Thomas Wilson\nI was in the butterfly house at the Melbourne Zoo with my daughter a few months ago admiring the elegant little creatures as they landed on the arms and shoulders of visitors. The beautiful delicate wings so full of colour when all of a sudden an Indian man grabbed a butterfly by the wings and starting waving the poor creature in front of his elderly mother\u2019s face.\nMaybe she was blind and he was just trying to let her see it close up but before I knew it I was saying \u201cNO, NO, you cannot do that. You will hurt the poor creature.\u201d Of course they didn\u2019t really understand English that well so just thought I was scared of the butterfly until I started waving my finger disapprovingly like a butterfly lover in distress.\nAfterward I did feel really bad, I felt terrible for making someone feel bad when they were just appreciating nature\u2019s wonders, especially a visitor. Maybe it was the closet zoologist in me, who completed the degree but never worked a day in the field, trying to do my bit for animal conservation.\nI found myself being extra polite as we passed each other many more times in the tight confines of an overcrowded butterfly house, insisting the elderly mother go before me as we both approached the exit.\nI think next time I\u2019ll try to resist the impulse and leave it to natural selection; the butterfly did fly off unharmed of course.\nWhilst I completely agree that some \u201crules\u201d need to be modernised, such as marriage equality, some rules shouldn\u2019t, like don\u2019t grab a butterfly wings! Which at the end of the day is exactly the same thing \u2026 freedom.\n\u2014 Patricia Chircop\nI think your daughter was right.\nYou should have, with the greatest of courtesy, drawn their attention to the \u201cno feeding\u201d rule. If they had been reasonable people they would have been grateful to you for pointing it out.\nSpeaking as a long-term immigrant to Britain, I can say through personal experience that often it is not a case of (usually newly arrived) immigrants not following the rules. It\u2019s a case of not knowing what the rules are: standing in a queue, not throwing litter out of a car, not interrupting while someone is speaking, remembering to top and tail requests with \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you.\u201d\nIt is not that we have some fundamental objection to doing (or not doing) these things: It\u2019s more that often we don\u2019t know what needs to be done. Somebody please tell us \u2014 we want to learn, and through learning save ourselves some embarrassment!\n\u2014 Vani K. Borooah\nAnother interesting quandary I have encountered in my career as a teacher is of migrant families requesting a school for a white Australian blue-eyed blonde teacher for their child over a \u201cbrown\u201d teacher \u2014 it makes for a proud display of the class photo to relatives back home, signaling they have finally \u201carrived\u201d in Australia and raising their prestige in society.\nWould this classify as a hangover of colonization, discrimination or market forces in the independent education sector, where if you are paying exorbitant school fees you can bend the rules to get what you want?\n\u2014 Ipshita Nair\nIn not calling someone out on breaking the rules, it\u2019s because it\u2019s much less hassle and it\u2019s being \u201ctoo serious\u201d and the rule being broken is \u201charmless.\u201d\nIt\u2019s just bread. It\u2019s just food. It\u2019s not a big deal. It\u2019s just a couple of kilometers over the limit, it\u2019s just some paper with your name signed on it and a label of \u201cmarried.\u201d\nThis extends from all manner of interpersonal interaction on the social and professional level all the way into our politicians \u2014 who are too busy calling each other names for a laugh than being serious for five minutes.\nThe problem is, we don\u2019t really draw a line.\nThat\u2019s because we can\u2019t help but want to fit into the way our society runs \u2014 the casual, hands-off, \u201cnah, she\u2019ll be right mate\u201d approach to everything that is so deeply ingrained in our culture that we struggle to care enough to change anything for fear of being called out \u2014 not for breaking the rules, but for disturbing the peaceful, carefree status quo we\u2019ve established.\n\u2014 David Tillett\nI am not suggesting that we become a nation of rule breakers but Australia is truly a \u201cCompliance Nation\u201d progressively getting worse. And unfortunately a general ambivalence by the population is letting it happen.\n\u2014 Grant Kennedy\n______\nA New York Times investigation that chronicled a hidden history of sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein continued to ripple through Hollywood all week. By Sunday evening, his entertainment company fired him. Then new accusations emerged.\nSeveral actresses have now come forward and spoken to or emailed my colleagues about their own experiences with Mr. Weinstein. \u201cWe\u2019re at a point in time when women need to send a clear message that this is over,\u201d Gwyneth Paltrow said. \u201cThis way of treating women ends now.\u201d\n______\nThe suffering of Myanmar\u2019s Rohingya minority continues, with another swell of refugees fleeing to Bangladesh this week. Our South Asia bureau chief, Jeffrey Gettleman, recently spent time in the camps documenting what many there describe as massacres and atrocities targeting women and children.\nTo put the crisis in context for our Australian readers, I interviewed two other Times reporters, Hannah Beech and Ben C. Solomon, who have been covering the situation on the ground in Bangladesh.\n______\nThose pesky Americans, why are they trying to trademark and pass off Aussie stuff as their own \u2014 like ugg boots? Jacqueline Williams reported the story of one Australian\u2019s legal battle in the United States for the rights to Australia\u2019s beloved ugly boots and it\u2019s a David and Goliath story worth reading.\nWe also wrote this week about the new Vegemite, and the Australian government\u2019s efforts to move refugees from Manus to Nauru.\n\u201cWe do not know what is our sentence,\u201d one of the refugees on Manus told us. \u201cWe do not know how many more years we will have to be kept hostage in here.\u201d\n______\n\u2022 Greg Dorfman argues that President Trump is changing the culture of Washington by violating the customs of language and approach that \u201care the scaffolding that supports the otherwise fragile words of our written Constitution.\u201d\n\u2022 Peter Wehner, who served in the Bush White House, explores the divide over President Trump among conservatives, noting with humility that even he is caught up with \u201ca severe case of confirmation bias, the tendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one\u2019s existing beliefs.\u201d\n\u2022 Jason M. Barr explores why the world\u2019s tallest buildings are rising all over Asia, especially in China.\n\u2022 Ruchir Sharma tries to calm our nerves about automation: \u201cWhen new technology destroys, it leaves behind a layer of ash in which new jobs grow.\u201d\n______\nWondering what kind of work to pursue? Or how to design the life you want?\nMillie Tran, our global growth editor, recently shared a presentation she had put together on that topic, pulling from her own life and unorthodox career path. Many of her friends and colleagues (me included) found it valuable and insightful \u2014 and so rather than keep it private, someone smarter than me adapted it for the Smarter Living newsletter (sign up here).\nRead that version, or the view the presentation, which features links, questions and a strategy for women in particular.\nP.S. \u2014 On a related note, we just announced a new gender editor: Jessica Bennett, the author of \u201cFeminist Fight Club.\u201d I\u2019ll be back at some point with more on Jess in this newsletter and in our Facebook group for subscribers, but here\u2019s an interview with her that lays out what lies ahead.",

    "text": "What 7 Fishmongers Wore to Work at the Fulton Fish Market\n2017-10-03T09:00:40.000Z\nThe Fulton Fish Market in the Bronx is less a market than a refrigerated warehouse. Relocated in 2005 from its old home in Lower Manhattan, it is almost a quarter-mile long, with almost 30 seafood wholesalers selling more than 300 varieties of fish, from barramundi to wahoo. On a recent Wednesday morning, before the sun rose over the East River (the action starts daily at 1 a.m.), fishmongers, journeymen, wholesalers and dispatchers talked about what they were wearing. \nOccupation: Fish salesman for Blue Ribbon Fish Company\nAge: 62\nWhy do they call you Coach?\nYears ago I used to coach a lot of sports: high school baseball, Little League baseball, girls basketball. One year I won the coach-of-the-year award and it just stuck.\nYou\u2019re dressed differently from anyone else here.\nI wear the apron so my pants and my undergarments don\u2019t get completely soaked through. And I wear this ugly jacket because it\u2019s so cold in here.\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s ugly. I think it\u2019s cool.\nWell, when the slime is off. It\u2019s an old army jacket. A friend gave it to me. At the end of Friday, I wash it. You saw how I lifted the fish. You get filthy. \nWhat do you wear underneath?\nSweatshirt. T-shirt.\nWhat does your hat say?\nSeatide. It\u2019s one of my customers.\nOccupation: Red snapper salesman\nAge: 25\nTell me something I don\u2019t know about red snapper.\nI don\u2019t know how it tastes. I\u2019ve been selling it for eight months, but I never ate red snapper.\nThat\u2019s insane. How do you sell it then?\nI sell by the color, how red it is, by the size. These are one to two pounds. In a good day we\u2019ll go through 20 to 30 boxes of 70 pounds. So, around 2,000 pounds. \nHow do you dress to sell fish?\nBefore I change into this, I\u2019m in basketball shorts and T-shirt. And then I come in and put my long pants on, regular T-shirt, button-down and a vest. I have three shirts, three pants, one vest. I wash them every Friday. I used to do it every day, but I couldn\u2019t bring home the smell.\nAre you warm enough?\nYeah.\nAnd you\u2019ve got a Dolphins hat.\nI\u2019m a Miami Dolphins fan. They keep me guessing every year. \nOccupation: Dispatcher \nAge: 47\nWhat does a dispatcher here do?\nI send all the fish out to the trucks to the journeymen.\nYou have a lot of pens in your pocket. \nI have to sign off. When they buy, they get a receipt, a card, and I sign off.\nHow do you dress for work?\nWarm. Very warm. It gets chilly in here sometimes. We wear thermals under here. This is refrigerator gear. It\u2019s required.\nDo you wash it every day?\nWe invest in it. I buy three or four jackets, and I wash them once a week. This is a company uniform. Some companies don\u2019t have uniforms; others have different colored uniforms.\nAnd you have a diamond in your ear.\nI never take it out. It stays in 24.\n\nOccupation: Fish salesman \nAge: 55 \nWhat time do you get here in the morning.\nWe start at 1 o\u2019clock. But I have to leave my house at 11:30 p.m., because I live 64 miles from here.\nWhen do you sleep?\nIn the afternoon. Yesterday I went to bed at 5, and my wife woke me up at 11:30.\nYou wear overalls to work.\nI like overalls because they don\u2019t fall down. \nWhat\u2019s this sign on your T-shirt?\nThat\u2019s the union. Thirty-two years. \nWhy are you wearing a hat?\nIt sometimes gets cold when you don\u2019t have hair. This is what happens to your hair when you work 32 years for a fish company. \nDo you fish?\nNo. I can\u2019t stand fish. \nOccupation: Manager of Lockwood & Winant, a seafood wholesaler\nAge: 54\nAre you wearing a hook around your neck?\nI am.\nWhat\u2019s that for?\nIt\u2019s a helpful implement in my job. It\u2019s a physical job. I use it to hook boxes to drag them around, to hook fish to display them, so I don\u2019t have to use my hands. The salt water will eat your hands away. We all need this.\nHow do you get ready for work in terms of what you\u2019re wearing?\nI wear layered clothes because we\u2019re in a 38-degree environment. The boots have to be rubber. And because of the smell if you do wear regular clothes, those clothes are no longer wearable in polite society.\nYou mentioned that the fish market is a microcosm. Explain?\nNew York is such an ethnic melting pot, and everyone comes to buy their particular species. For example, Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi people love something called a king mackerel and a butterfish. Italian people like their calamari, their scungilli. Anglo-Saxon people do the lobster and the crab and the fillet. Mediterranean people will opt for sardines and herring, a darker meat fish like tuna. Asians like their sea bass, their gray sole. \nThere\u2019s a hundred different ethnic groups here and we not only do business together, we enjoy each other. It\u2019s a microcosm of how we should be.\nOccupation: Journeyman at Caleb Haley\nAge: 19\nWhat do you do here?\nI work in the salmon department, mostly stacking boxes.\nDo you need a special holster for your knives?\nYou have places to put them in your pockets.\nWhat\u2019s your move for getting the fish smell out of your clothes?\nIt\u2019s really hard. You have one set and then you wash it. \nThere\u2019s so much water all over. What do you do for footwear?\nBeater shoes. You can\u2019t wear nice shoes.\nOccupation: Fish salesman \nAge: 63\nWhat are you wearing?\nI got two thermals on and just a vest. \nThat\u2019s pretty light.\nWell, we\u2019ve been doing this a long time, so our bodies are acclimated to it.\nWhere did you get your vest from?\nDick\u2019s Sporting Goods store on Staten Island.\nWhat do you do for shoes?\nDickies. Mickey Mouse military jump boots.\nWhat does your hat say?\nColonial Springs. That was a gift from one of my customers.\n Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on Facebook (Styles and Modern Love), Twitter (Styles, Fashion and Weddings) and Instagram.",

    "text": "Canada Beckons International Students With a Path to Citizenship\n2017-01-26T23:11:56.000Z\nST. JOHN\u2019S, Newfoundland \u2014 At the College of the North Atlantic here, a young Chinese woman stood discussing her future with two fellow students, a Bangladeshi man and a Korean woman, amid a flow of mostly pale Newfoundlanders in down coats and hoodies heading for class.\n\u201cThe environment here is really good, so I think for my health I will stay,\u201d said Fei Jie, from China\u2019s eastern Shandong Province. The others said they, too, were planning to remain in the country after graduation, eventually becoming Canadian citizens.\nTheir path is no accident. They are three of hundreds of thousands of international students in Canada today as part of a government strategy to reshape Canadian demographics by funneling well-educated, skilled workers through the university system. It is an answer to Canada\u2019s aging population and slowing birthrate, and an effort to shore up the nation\u2019s tax base.\nIn November, the federal government changed its electronic immigration-selection system, called Express Entry, to make it easier for international students to become citizens. And a bill pending in the Senate would restore a rule that counts half of students\u2019 time spent studying in Canada toward the period of residency required for citizenship.\nThe country needs talented immigrants to backfill a thinly spread, aging population. According to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, the country\u2019s immigration department, immigrants already make up 75 percent of the annual net growth in the country\u2019s work force and are expected to account for 100 percent within 10 years.\nThe strategy, which builds on a decade-long trend and was formally laid out in 2014, seems to be working. In the 2015-16 school year, Canada\u2019s international student population grew 8 percent to more than 350,000 \u2014 equal to roughly 1 percent of the country\u2019s population. The number of international students in the United States is less than one-third of 1 percent of the population.\nCanada expects to have nearly half a million international students studying in the country within 10 years. And more than half its students from abroad hope to stay in the country and become Canadian citizens, according to a survey by the Canadian Bureau for International Education.\n\u201cAll of the building blocks are in place, just in terms of the reputation of our education system for quality, the reputation of the country as tolerant and safe, and the affordability of education in Canada and the opportunities that Canada gives to international students to be welcomed on a more permanent basis,\u201d said Karen McBride, the president of the Canadian Bureau for International Education, an association of educational institutions.\nInternationalizing Canadian education promises a deep and lasting effect on the country, binding it to other nations and cultures through the family ties and the broader perspectives of international students who become citizens and may even rise to positions of national power. Canada\u2019s new immigration minister, for example, arrived in the country as a Somali refugee and earned a law degree at the University of Ottawa.\nBut the strategy may also lead to tensions similar to those seen in the United States and Europe as the makeup of Canadian society evolves and less educated segments of the mostly white work force feel pushed aside.\nSince the early 1970s, when Canada embraced multiculturalism, the percentage of what it calls \u201cvisible minorities\u201d has ballooned to about 20 percent of the population.\nStatistics Canada, the country\u2019s census bureau, predicts that the number will reach nearly 30 percent by 2030. Nonwhites will make up a majority of the population in Toronto and Vancouver.\nSo far, Canadians have shown a remarkable equanimity toward the influx, one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the developed world. While polls show a gradual uptick in concern about the flow of new arrivals, mostly tied to unskilled Syrian refugees, the country on the whole remains welcoming to outsiders.\nBut non-Canadians are already crowding out local students at some of the country\u2019s best-known schools. International students at McGill University in Montreal make up a quarter of total enrollments. In British Columbia, where students from abroad make up 18 percent of the total enrollment, people in the province are beginning to grumble that locals are being passed over in favor of non-Canadians who pay higher fees.\nThe University of British Columbia created a controversy with its plans to spend 127 million Canadian dollars, roughly $95 million, to build a school, Vantage College, for international students \u2014 mostly Chinese \u2014 who need to improve their English before matriculating at the university.\nSimilar tensions have plagued schools in the United States that increasingly rely on tuition from international students to balance their budgets.\nInternational students typically pay more than domestic students, and many, particularly from China, come from affluent families eager to establish a toehold in North America. The money these students bring helps subsidize education for domestic students, but can also distort local economies.\nAbout half of Canada\u2019s inbound students come from China and the government wants even more. Former Immigration Minister John McCallum, recently named ambassador to China, met with Chinese officials in August, hoping to double or even triple the number of Canadian visa application centers in mainland China from the four the country has now, not including Hong Kong.\nAmit Chakma, the president of the University of Western Ontario who led a 2012 government advisory panel that developed the core of the government strategy, said there was plenty of capacity among smaller, high-quality institutions in Canada that are struggling to fill their classrooms as applications from high school graduates fall.\nIndeed, it\u2019s not just major cities that are attracting students from abroad. High schools, colleges and universities across the country are seeing an influx of international students. The fastest growth in the past year has been on tiny Prince Edward Island, Canada\u2019s smallest province. Yukon College\u2019s website, meanwhile, has been translated into Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Portuguese.\nEven the broad middle of the country is getting its fair share. The Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and Technology in Regina, for example, has expanded its International English Language Testing System program to meet the demand, which has doubled, by non-Canadians who need to pass the English proficiency exam for immigration requirements.\nJack Wu, who arrived from China, manages the design of circuit protection systems for hydro-electric transmission lines. He studied at the College of the North Atlantic in St. John\u2019s before earning an electrical engineering degree in 2005 from Ontario\u2019s Lakehead University. He and his wife immigrated through a provincial program for people who have studied in Newfoundland and Labrador. The process from student to citizen took them about two and a half years.\n\u201cOur daughters were born here,\u201d Mr. Wu said proudly, sitting in a Tim Hortons, the quintessentially Canadian fast-food chain. \u201cThey are Newfoundlanders.\u201d",

    "text": "Britain Is an Immigrant Nation\n2017-03-09T18:05:29.000Z\nLONDON \u2014 The central exhibit of the Museum of Immigration and Diversity is the building itself. Located in London\u2019s East End, it straddles the Docklands to its east, where new arrivals to Britain once hit dry land, and to its west the city, whose shiny office towers stand as the symbols of wealth and opportunity that have attracted so many newcomers.\nThis unassuming Georgian building on 19 Princelet Street has migration written into its bricks and mortar. Built in 1719, the house was once home to Huguenots fleeing persecution from Catholic France, and then to families forced to leave Ireland during the potato famine of the 1840s. Later in the 19th century, Jewish refugees from pogroms in Russia and Eastern Europe turned the garden into a small synagogue. In the 1930s, the Jewish East Enders used the basement to hold meetings for the movement that faced down the fascist Blackshirts in the famous Battle of Cable Street.\nThe period that followed bequeathed one of the nation\u2019s most enduringly positive immigration stories. Just before World War II, Britain took in some 10,000 mostly Jewish children through the Kindertransport rescue program. Last year, one of those children, Alf Dubs, a Labour member of the House of Lords, won popular support for his campaign to bring 3,000 unaccompanied child refugees into the country.\nIn the postwar period, the Princelet Street house and surrounding streets were home to new migrant communities \u2014 from Bangladesh, the Caribbean and, most recently, Eastern Europe. Much like New York\u2019s landmark Lower East Side Tenement Museum, the Museum of Immigration and Diversity intertwines all these strands. Each room showcases a different aspect of the immigrant experience, narrating histories through objects, diaries and recordings.\nIn a larger way, of course, the very story of Britain has always been one of migrants. Poke around behind Britain\u2019s currently rigid surface of chauvinism and a composite picture emerges \u2014 of Romans, Vikings, Celts, Normans, Jews, Indians, Chinese, Africans and more. The whole country is a living museum of immigration \u2014 if only its people would acknowledge it.\nBut Brexit Britain, you might suppose, is not a country much inclined to hear migration stories. Whatever else can be read into the referendum vote to leave the European Union, it was characterized by hostility about the flow of people to Britain and campaigning that played heavily on fears of immigration.\nIndeed, Brexit follows years of pandering to fears over immigration, cast as legitimate concerns, with polling consistently placing the issue at the top of the public\u2019s list of concerns. As in the United States and much of mainland Europe, Britain \u2014 or more accurately, England \u2014 is going through a period of resurgent nativism. The telltale signs are imprinted on the national conversation, with its undue preoccupation with cultural differences. A sharp division is drawn between the left-behind and a cosmopolitan elite, a too-fast influx of young, flexible workers versus rooted, traditional families trying to get by.\nThis ominous tone, with its rejection of rootless outsiders, is easily picked up by those sensitized to its message. And it comes from the top. In a speech to Conservatives last year, the prime minister, their party leader Theresa May, proclaimed, \u201cIf you believe you are a citizen of the world, you\u2019re a citizen of nowhere.\u201d Last month, against a public outcry, her government canceled its support for the Dubs Amendment, a deal on bringing in child refugees, named for the Labour politician. This week, a parliamentary vote narrowly failed to reinstate the policy, despite the support of some Tory rebels.\nUnlike America, and some European countries, Britain does not have a national museum of migration. There is no Ellis Island, nor anything like France\u2019s National Museum of the History of Immigration. The paradox is that Britons hold more positive views about diversity and integration than the citizens of other European countries do, yet migration is a curious blank in the history that the country tells itself \u2014 a version that emphasizes the outward travels of empire, allowing for only a brief spate of postwar immigration in this tale of an otherwise homogeneous island.\nThis split national consciousness abides today. Even as the national mood sours toward able newcomers taking British jobs, there is widespread support for the immigrant workers who keep the National Health Service running. In part, this is because the N.H.S., the great institution of Britain\u2019s postwar welfare state, has taken its place in national mythology. But in part also, it is because the health service is so integral to British life. From birth, through life, to death, everyone at some point comes into contact with the service\u2019s legions of caring, dedicated doctors and nurses from around the world.\nAll of which provides good reason to inject more of Britain\u2019s motley history into its apparently resistant idea of itself. There is a clear need to tackle what the writer Robert Winder, in his chronicle of the country\u2019s immigration history, \u201cBloody Foreigners,\u201d describes as the \u201camnesiac streak\u201d Britain has \u201cwhen it comes to acknowledging the immigrant blood in her veins.\u201d As he narrates, migration legacies are inscribed in quintessentially English cathedrals; in the nation\u2019s historical figures and place names; in the English language itself, so full of nuance precisely because it is a rich amalgam; and in all those imported customs and values now deemed British and ordered to be rote-learned by newcomers.\nMr. Winder is also a trustee of the Migration Museum Project, a charity that seeks to create a permanent historical collection. The project recently secured a central London location to use as a pop-up space, but the idea is to build a base in the capital and also partner with other museums across the country, so that its collections themselves would be migratory.\nJust when they\u2019re needed, such historical exhibits may find funding harder to come by \u2014 so politicized is the subject, and the country so polarized on the issue. The Princelet Street building lacks the capital for the major repairs that would allow it to open full time. But politically amplified hostility may be obscuring more sympathetic public interest: On the days the museum can open, the line of visitors snakes far down the street.\nSince Brexit, the country has seen a spike in hate crimes and racist abuse. Those who are dismayed by this xenophobic turn often say, \u201cThis isn\u2019t who we are.\u201d It is meant as a reminder of the British values of generosity and openness, even the vastly underestimated quality of indifference \u2014 prerequisite to a live-and-let-live society \u2014 in a country called home by so many, from so many parts of the world.\nOf course, that is only part of the story. Historically, as now, the national response to migration has always been a mix of kindness and suspicion, hospitality and resentment. But the claim works as a rebuttal of exclusionary, nativist definitions of British identity. It only takes a stroll down Princelet Street to learn that this is not who Britons are. Nor who they ever have been.",

    "text": "Navigating the Fair: Highlights of Art Basel Hong Kong\n2017-03-22T04:01:22.000Z\nThe roving international spectacle that is Art Basel continues to cement Hong Kong\u2019s claim as the capital of the Asian art market. Planners have kept the festival as big as ever, even expanding the scope of its programming and the number of participating galleries, however modestly.\nThe approach reflects a dual reality: 2016 was a tough year for the art market, with the big auction houses reporting steep declines in total sales compared with 2015; at the same time, China was said to have reclaimed its position as the world\u2019s strongest art marketplace in 2016. Many experts believe that the drop in contemporary art sales that China experienced in the last five years has bottomed out, according to a report by ArtTactic, a market analysis firm.\nThe fair will be held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, on Victoria Harbor. This year, 242 galleries from 34 countries will participate.\nAlongside the usual big names, 29 are new to the fair this year, 11 from Asia. (Roughly half of all participating galleries have spaces in Asia and the Asia-Pacific region.) Public viewing days are from March 23 to 25. (The film program began on March 20.) As with each fair that bears the Basel brand, the offerings are diverse and sprawling. Here are a few highlights.\nA consistently rewarding feature of each Basel fair is the \u201cDiscoveries\u201d sector, devoted to emerging artists. The sector is also an opportunity for up-and-coming galleries: Of the 25 in Discoveries, 12 are new to Hong Kong this year.\nAmong the highlights are a series of works by the Bangladeshi-British artist Rana Begum with the Jhaveri Contemporary gallery, in Mumbai, India, whose sharp-edged, colorful paintings and sculptures combine aspects of constructivism, minimalism and the aesthetics of Islamic art and ritual she absorbed as a child. Another entry is an assemblage-based work called \u201cTowards Pure White\u201d by the Indian artist Astha Butail with Galleryske in Bangalore, whose suggestive and finely wrought objects recall the crisp, seamless craftsmanship of Martin Puryear or Laszlo Moholy-Nagy.\nParticipating galleries are chosen by a committee, based upon specific project proposals, said Adeline Ooi, Asia director for Art Basel, who added, \u201cThis is the sector where we need to expose as much as possible what\u2019s going on in the sense of the international discourse.\u201d\nThe \u201cEncounters\u201d sector at Hong Kong is dedicated to larger-scale works of what in most contexts would be described as public art. At Hong Kong, 16 of the 17 installations in the sector will sit under the same roof as the main \u201cGalleries\u201d sector, placed throughout walkways that traverse and divide the two main exhibition halls \u2014 what the sector\u2019s curator, Alexie Glass-Kantor, refers to as \u201cmeridians.\u201d (One of the installations, Joyce Ho\u2019s \u201cOn the second day, Saturday, your three minutes,\u201d will be in a separate, hidden space beyond the main floor.)\nAlthough Encounters does not technically have a theme, Ms. Glass-Kantor said she was organizing this year\u2019s program around the concept of time. The second meridian, which examines the politics of time, seems particularly compelling. Included are a striking and disturbing series from 2009 by the Chinese artist Shen Shaomin (Osage Gallery) involving hyper-realistic recreations of the corpses of five dead Communist dictators. Also on display will be an arrangement of 180 replicas by the young Filipino-British artist Pio Abad (Silverlens) of the black Asprey handbag carried by Margaret Thatcher.\n\u201cFor so many of us at the moment, the Chinese proverb and curse \u2018May you live in interesting times\u2019 is one that carries additional weight,\u201d Ms. Glass-Kantor said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think you can avoid in any way the kind of social, cultural and political implications of the times in which we find ourselves.\u201d\nAbbas Kiarostami, who died last year, was among the most widely acclaimed filmmakers of the last 30 years. But he was also a photographer, and his photography reflects the influence of his early training as a painter.\nA display of his photographs from 2002, \u201cSnow Series,\u201d will be presented by the Rossi & Rossi gallery as part of the fair\u2019s new \u201cKabinett\u201d sector, and comprises numerous black-and-white images of snow-shrouded landscapes. Moody, stark and deliberately composed and executed, they recall the high formalism of f/64 Group photographers like Ansel Adams, Imogen Cunningham and Edward Weston, who sought a purity of form that sometimes verged into hyper-realism or abstraction.\nAbout his photography, Mr. Kiarostami said that it was \u201capparent that my photographs are made of the same substance as my dreams.\u201d \u201cSnow Series\u201d is an intimate view into the direct, minimalistic and rigorous aesthetic vision he pursued to transcendent effect in his films.\nThe main Galleries sector of the fair comprises nearly 200 exhibitors, the overwhelming majority of which have presented at Art Basel Hong Kong before; among those showing, only nine have not.\nBecause the more established galleries will, as always, offer an overwhelming supply of art that is good and not so good (but, above all, commercially viable), a few of the newcomers are worth a look. The Third Line gallery of Dubai, United Arab Emirates, a regular for several years at smaller fairs like Frieze and the Independent, will present works by the Iranian artist Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian, whose mirror-based mosaics and sculptures and reverse-glass paintings were the subject of a traveling retrospective presented in 2015 at the Guggenheim Museum in New York.\nThe German-based Galerie Buchholz is another notable addition, bringing to Hong Kong an impressive array of work by artists, including Isa Genzken (the subject of a big 2013 retrospective at New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art), the German photographer Wolfgang Tillmans and the Vietnamese-Danish sculptor and conceptual artist Danh Vo.\nThe nearly 40 films in Basel Hong Kong\u2019s film program \u2014 which is focused mostly on short works \u2014 will be screened in Theater 2 of the convention and exhibition center.\nHong Kong has a rich and complicated cinematic tradition. Ho Tzu Nyen, a Singaporean artist, captures some of that history and complexity in his experimental film \u201cThe Nameless\u201d (2015), which tells the story of Lai Teck, the secretary-general of the Malayan Communist Party from 1939 to 1947 who was also a triple-agent spy. One of three feature-length films in the fair, it is scheduled to screen on March 22.\nMr. Ho tells Teck\u2019s story by stitching together various clips of the Hong Kong actor Tony Leung, the star of films like \u201cIn the Mood for Love\u201d and \u201cThe Grandmaster,\u201d by the director Wong Kar-wai \u2014 an approach that nods, Mr. Ho told Quartz last year, to \u201cHong Kong cinema\u2019s fixation of a double identity.\u201d\nLi Zhenhua, the program\u2019s curator, said he did not see a \u201cvery direct connection\u201d between the films and \u201cthe art market thing.\u201d But given the increased tendency of contemporary artists to embrace a multimedia approach to art-making, the program does serve as a kind of bellwether, he said. \u201cI would consider it as more or less a kind of not-for-profit touch to the whole fair,\u201d he said of the program, \u201cwhile also giving a little hint of the future of where the art market will be.\u201d",

    "text": "In a Fragile Partnership, Dolphins Help Catch Fish in Myanmar\n2017-08-31T16:16:00.000Z\nMANDALAY, Myanmar \u2014 On a recent sweltering afternoon on the Irrawaddy River, about 10 miles upstream from the city of Mandalay, a Burmese fisherman tapped a small teak dowel against the hull of his squat wooden boat, producing a xylophonic beat.\nDrawn by the drumming, the gray, melon-shaped forehead of an Irrawaddy dolphin \u2014 one of maybe 65 left in their eponymous waterway \u2014 breached the surface nearby. The dolphin was joined by about a dozen more, and together they began herding a school of thrashing baitfish toward the sun-weathered fisherman, who waited on the boat with a throw net.\nBut before he could cast it, a barge loaded with pyramids of logs chugged past, causing the dolphins to dive and scattering the fish. Frustrated, the fisherman, U Thin Myu, began trying to drum up his partners again with the dowel. But a parade of barges from Mandalay, Myanmar\u2019s second-largest city, motored toward him and his wife, who was rowing at the stern.\nMr. Thin Myu is one of a few dozen fishermen left in Myanmar who know how to cooperate with Irrawaddy dolphins to fill their nets. Dwindling numbers of the endangered dolphins live in freshwater rivers and bays, including in Bangladesh and Indonesia, but only the population in Myanmar has been definitively documented as cooperating with humans. It is one of the few known instances of cooperation between humans and wild animals in the world.\nIrrawaddy dolphins have a long history with humans: A Chinese text dated to A.D. 800 noted, \u201cThe Pyu people traded this animal to China, and they named it the river pig.\u201d\nWhen the dolphins stopped being prey and became partners is not known, but Mr. Thin Myu, 44, says he thinks it started in the times of his great-grandfather, who was a fisherman as well. Mr. Thin Myu said he had learned how to fish with dolphins from his brother and uncle. Back then, he told me, the fishermen had names for every dolphin, and the dolphins were so enthusiastic that they would spit water on fishermen sleeping in their boats at night to wake them to fish before dawn.\nBut the cooperation has frayed in the last decade as Myanmar has emerged from a half-century of isolation under a military junta.\nAs the nation has modernized, the threats confronting the river dolphins have multiplied. Mercury from illegal gold mines, fertilizer from farms and industrial waste from factories have polluted the Irrawaddy. Increased ship traffic has harried the dolphins, and collisions are often fatal. Overfishing has devastated food sources, and the dolphins can get trapped in fixed gillnets and drown. Several are believed to have been electrocuted by fishermen illegally using car batteries to try to stun fish.\nIn 2012, the Wildlife Conservation Society reported finding 77 dolphins in the Irrawaddy. A 2016 survey found only 65. Since 2006, Myanmar\u2019s government has established a special dolphin protective zone stretching about 50 miles north of Mandalay. But in the zone\u2019s early years, there was little enforcement against electroshock fishing or pollution.\nRecently, patrols have increased, and U Han Win, a researcher at Myanmar\u2019s Department of Fisheries, says that dolphin conservation efforts have turned a corner. \u201cThe population decline of the dolphins would have been steeper if not for conservation,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, despite many challenges, the population is stable and doing better than it would have otherwise because of the conservation efforts.\u201d\nMr. Thin Myu, the fisherman, said that the increased patrols had made a positive difference. \u201cBecause of the patrols, now there are fewer electric fishermen,\u201d he said, \u201cand so the dolphins are working more cooperatively with us.\u201d\nAs he waited for the convoy of barges to rumble past his boat, Mr. Thin Myu patiently smoked a cheroot. After the convoy passed, he was again able to call the dolphins. He yelped at two he recognized, one by the distinctive white band around its neck, as if greeting old friends.\nOne of the dolphins turned upside down, lifted its tail out of the water and slapped it down hard to the right \u2014 signaling to Mr. Thin Myu the location of their prey. With a shot-putter\u2019s twist, he cast his net. The white mesh billowed open and came down over the roiling water. Another dolphin swam behind the splashing fish, herding them into the net. As Mr. Thin Myu reeled it in, the dolphins plucked at escaping fish.\nMr. Thin Myu yanked a half-dozen small fish from the net, not yet enough for a full meal for his family. On better days, he would sell his excess catch at the market. But he never gave any to the dolphins \u2014 they had learned to cooperate with the fishermen independently, perhaps because they could steal fish tangled in the net.\nAs the number of dolphins has dwindled, so has the number of fishermen who know how to work with them. According to the Wildlife Conservation Society, which helps Myanmar\u2019s government manage the cetaceans, the number of cooperative fishermen has dropped to 65 \u2014 exactly the same as the number of Irrawaddy dolphins believed to still be in the river. Most of the fishermen are older, and finding new recruits is a challenge.\nMr. Thin Myu trained his son to work with the dolphins, but the son left their village for Mandalay, so his wife now rows while he handles the net. Still, he has been tutoring five youths, trying to pass on the tradition. But with Myanmar\u2019s economic development, he has noticed that young people find city jobs more alluring than trying to squeeze a living from the river.\nThe best hope to save both the dolphins and the fishermen may be ecotourism. Mr. Han Win, of the Department of Fisheries, estimated that 700 to 1,000 tourists come to see the dolphins every year. Most arrive on cruise ships and have little interest in the fishermen. But recently, the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries and Rural Development have begun to encourage smaller tours to accompany the fishermen, for which they are paid the equivalent of $20, a welcome sum in a country where the average worker makes $500 a month.\nU Kyaw Hla Thein, a project manager for the Wildlife Conservation Society, said, \u201cEcotourism encourages local fishermen to move away from harmful activities like electroshock fishing and maintain their traditional lifestyles. Dolphin conservation won\u2019t be a success without ecotourism, and ecotourism won\u2019t be a success without conservation.\u201d\nWhether the dolphins and their partnership can endure in the face of Myanmar\u2019s rapid modernization is unknown. Scientific study of the cooperative fishing phenomenon has been sparse.\nBrian Wood, an anthropology professor at Yale University, has researched similar instances of cooperation between humans and wild honeyguide birds to harvest honey in Tanzania.\n\u201cAs industrial lifestyles replace traditional ones across the world, humanity\u2019s longstanding relationships with nature are disappearing,\u201d Professor Wood said. \u201cOnce these relationships are lost, it\u2019s almost impossible to get them back.\u201d\n\u201cThe dolphins\u2019 intelligence led them to partner with us originally because of the benefits they gained from us,\u201d he added. \u201cAs they become less cooperative, they may be concluding it is no longer in their best interest to work as our partners.\u201d",

    "text": "20 Great Reads You Probably Missed in 2017\n2017-12-30T03:20:33.000Z\nThere was a lot of news in 2017 \u2014 just take a look at the 750 breaking news alerts The New York Times sent this year, a 30 percent jump from last year. So we understand if you might have missed some of these great reads. Here\u2019s a selection of some of our favorite somewhat-overlooked stories from the past year.\nAs Turkey\u2019s governing party expands the ranks of its enemies, life in a fragile democracy becomes stranger and stranger. Many Turks \u2014 journalists, academics, Kurds and people accused of working for the exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen \u2014 live in exile, having lost their livelihoods and their citizenship, and having been separated from their husbands and wives and children. By Suzy Hansen.\nEdith Rivera loved her life in Hampton, Iowa, but like many undocumented immigrants she faced a tough choice. She decided to return to Mexico, where her husband had been deported in 2015, with their American-born teenage son. Some politicians call it \u201cself-deportation.\u201d She called it her family\u2019s only hope of being together. By Jack Healy.\nKazakhstan wants to wean itself from a dependence on natural resources and transform itself into a financial hub, the Dubai of Central Asia. There are plans for a new stock exchange overseen by an independent judicial system. Tech start-ups will get the come-hither, too, with the hope of giving rise to Kazakhstan\u2019s own version of Silicon Valley. But its president still has the trappings of an old-school authoritarian. By David Segal.\nEven by the standards of one of the nation\u2019s most dysfunctional prison systems, the maximum-security St. Clair Correctional Facility in Alabama stood out for its violence. The prison is overcrowded, and the number of guards has plummeted. By Campbell Robertson.\nWith \u201cJunk,\u201d the Pulitzer-winning playwright Ayad Akhtar examines financial chicanery in the 1980s \u2014 and how it shaped the blind worship of affluence today. By Michael Sokolove.\nHome to seven main tribes, the Omo region in the southwestern corner of Ethiopia is now on the precipice. The Ethiopian government has recently completed the third of five proposed dams upriver. The dams threaten to alter the lives of the communities that have inhabited this valley for millennium and depend on the river\u2019s moods for survival. By Andrew McCarthy.\nEl Salvador\u2019s gangs are trying to negotiate a way out of their bloody stalemate with the police. They created a gang coordination group for dialogue. They even asked a United Nations special envoy to initiate a dialogue with the government. By Azam Ahmed.\nThe granddaughter of a prosperous cattle baron and real estate magnate, she vanished in broad daylight just after leaving her Tucson school on a spring day in 1934. Nineteen days later, June was found bewildered but alive in a makeshift wood-and-sheet-metal cage buried in the broiling desert. By Sam Roberts.\nBoy Scouts seem to emphasize doing things (activities like white-water rafting, welding and bugling) while Girl Scouts emphasize caring for others (being a good neighbor, a voice for animals, a social butterfly). As the Boy Scouts prepare to accept girls, it\u2019s worth asking what they can learn from the Girl Scouts. By Claire Cain Miller.\nThe receding Arctic ice has opened new passageways for high-speed internet cables. One of the fastest internet connections in America is arriving in Point Hope, a gravel spit in northwest Alaska, giving 700 or so residents their first taste of broadband speed. By Cecilia Kang.\nWith the fall of its capital and loss of territory in Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State may be reeling, but it is far from vanquished. Its leaders signaled more than a year ago that they had drawn up contingency plans to revert to their roots as a guerrilla force. The group also continues to inspire so-called lone wolf terrorist attacks abroad.

    "text": "In Brooklyn, a Hare Krishna Reckoning\n2017-12-22T10:00:45.000Z\nWeekdays at Govinda\u2019s Vegetarian Lunch, a cafeteria in the basement of Sri Sri Radha Govinda Mandir, the Hare Krishna temple located in the rapidly developing area of Downtown Brooklyn, is a peaceful affair. Outside, there are cranes, scaffolding and cement trucks. But inside and down a few stairs, there is faint, dulcet chanting piped through speakers. Contented diners, ranging from municipal workers to financial sector employees, sit together with plates piled full of eggplant Parmesan and chana masala.\nIt\u2019s a soothing respite for Govinda regulars. \u201cIt\u2019s been a weekly staple,\u201d said Javiel Vazquez, who works for Consolidated Edison nearby.\nThe tranquil atmosphere hasn\u2019t permeated the four floors above, however, where a fight over leadership has roiled the shrinking congregation. Prompted by a possible sale of the temple, at 295-311 Schermerhorn Street, for close to $60 million to a developer, a power struggle has pitted the temple president and his board of trustees against the leaders of the International Society of Krishna Consciousness, also known as Iskcon or the Hare Krishna Society.\nIt\u2019s the latest chapter in a series of sweeping changes for the Hare Krishnas in New York, many of whom have divergent views on how to adhere to the rules and tenets of what is now a large, international organization. These days the religion is more popular in India than it is in the United States, the country that nurtured and fueled the movement in the late 1960s and \u201870s. But at its most basic, the conflict also reveals how the real-world notions of financial power and political control can disrupt a religion that is supposed to embrace selflessness.\nFor a humble spiritual movement that was born in an East Village storefront, the Hare Krishna conflict in Brooklyn involves a lot of money, a good amount of litigation, and even, at some point, locked temple doors and private security guards.\nThe man who started the Hare Krishna movement in the United States, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada, was part of Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s civil disobedience movement in India and later became a disciple of a prominent Hindu guru who asked him to spread his teachings to the English-speaking world. So in 1965, at the age of 69, Swami Prabhupada traveled to New York on a cargo ship, arriving in the city with about $7 in Indian rupees and a crate of Sanskrit texts, according to the documentary \u201cHare Krishna! The Mantra, the Movement and the Swami Who Started It All.\u201d\nSoon Swami Prabhupada found himself on the Bowery, leading workshops on the Bhagavad Gita and overseeing devotional chanting in Tompkins Square Park, where there\u2019s now an elm tree dedicated to the religion. The idea of Krishna consciousness, that the material world is temporary and that people could attain high spiritual development through devotional service to the deity Krishna, dovetailed easily with the city\u2019s counterculture scene, according to Burke Rochford, a religion professor at Middlebury College.\nThe poet Allen Ginsberg, an early devotee who attended some of the first outreach sessions in New York, told The Times in 1966 that the chanting \u201cbrings a state of ecstasy.\u201d\nSwami Prabhupada, known to his followers as Srila Prabhupada, officially founded the Hare Krishna Society that same year. Its first temple was located in a former gift shop at 26 Second Avenue in Manhattan. Early devotees were mostly white Westerners, many of whom were disillusioned with American culture as the Vietnam War bore on.\nDevotees quit their jobs or dropped out of school; initially, they also gave up drugs and extramarital sex. Buoyed by the positive reaction from New Yorkers, and as donations and book sales started to bring in some money, Swami Prabhupada started to crisscross the nation to spread his teachings.\nHe even made hippie history in San Francisco, when members of the Hare Krishna Society organized the Mantra Rock Dance at the Avalon Ballroom in December 1967, according to the documentary. The Grateful Dead and other bands performed for free to raise money for a new Bay Area temple, with the founder as its special guest.\nCelebrity Krishnas also included George Harrison. \u201cThe Vedic scriptures gave some sort of backbone to my life,\u201d  Harrison said in the film. Harrison\u2019s first solo single after the Beatles, \u201cMy Sweet Lord,\u201d was an ode to Krishna and a worldwide hit.\nBy the religion\u2019s heyday in \u201970s New York, devotees were out in full force, chanting and selling scripture at the Port Authority Bus Terminal and at area airports. The temple moved several times, first to another Second Avenue location and then to 439 Henry Street in Brooklyn. In 1975, the organization moved to 340 West 55th Street, a 11-story building, where it thrived. There was a theater, a gift shop and a hotel, with hundreds of followers living communally in the upper floors.\n\u201cThe Manhattan location was so central, there were tons of people coming in and out of the building, raising money,\u201d said Lorelee Somershein (Jambavati Devi Dasi), a Springfield Gardens, Queens, resident who used to attend services there. \u201cIt was an exciting place to be.\u201d\nIn 1977, Swami Prabhupada died, and soon thereafter, the Krishnas were troubled with financial difficulties. Local leadership decided to sell the Manhattan property and splinter off into three groups, according to Jay Israel (Jayadvaita Swami), a disciple of Swami Prabhupada and the editor of many of his books. Between 1981 and 1982, one group went upstate, another to New Jersey and the third group decamped to the current temple in Downtown Brooklyn.\n\u201cWe let prime Manhattan real estate go,\u201d said Mr. Israel.\nIn Brooklyn, the temple attracted hundreds of people for Sunday services at first, but the congregation soon started to fracture, as did the organization at large. In 1996, a prominent leader in West Virginia, who had once run the largest Krishna community in the United States, was accused of murder and jailed for racketeering. Two years later, the Hare Krishna Society conceded that physical, sexual and emotional abuse of children occurred at its boarding schools across the country, including in Dallas, Seattle and several in India.\nAs the original, mostly Western members started to abandon the religion, there was an almost simultaneous uptick of new South Asian congregants. Many Hindu immigrants were attracted to the society\u2019s temples because they were reminders of home, said Mr. Rochford, who is the author of the book \u201cHare Krishna Transformed.\u201d\nThese days, the congregations of many American temples don\u2019t follow the Hare Krishna Society\u2019s tenets strictly, but rather use the temples to gather for cultural reasons, he said.\nThe religion, he added, is actually thriving in India. The society is currently building a $90 million facility, which includes a planetarium, in Mayapur, near the Bangladesh border, where it will serve as the new global headquarters. Alfred B. Ford, a devotee and the great-grandson of Henry Ford, donated $25 million to the project, said Geoffrey Walker (Anuttama Dasa), a spokesman for the society.\nBack in New York, however, the organization is suffering from an identity crisis and a lack of vision.\nAlthough there were between 50 and 60 devotees who lived at the Brooklyn temple in the \u201980s, the number of full-time volunteers dwindled over the years. By the \u201990s, many of the congregants were Indian and Bangladeshi immigrants who traveled from Queens and Long Island to the temple, which prompted the idea of building a new temple in Queens, said Heather Britten (Satya Dasi), the temple\u2019s treasurer and the force behind Govinda\u2019s Vegetarian Lunch.\nThe qualities that had once made the 93-year-old building attractive \u2014 large communal rooms and upper-floor dormitory space \u2014 now seemed outdated and unnecessary, Ms. Britten said. The income from donations, book sales and the cafe has not been enough to pay for the much-needed building repairs and utility bills.\nMs. Britten said that she believes a more modern space would benefit the community and help attract future members. Even though Downtown Brooklyn is booming, she explained, \u201cThe rent is so high in the area, there\u2019s not a lot of people from our congregation who live around here anymore.\u201d About 100 or so members attend Sunday services on a regular basis, she said.\n\nThe Krishnas are not the only religious order facing hard real estate decisions in New York. Many organizations, including several Catholic churches, have become key players in high-power real estate transactions. Facing dwindling attendance, churches, temples and synagogues have sold their properties to start fresh elsewhere, combine parishes or even sell their properties\u2019 air rights to developers.\nThe New York State attorney general\u2019s office, whose approval is required for most sales of religious properties in New York, received 165 sale petitions in 2016. So far this year, it has received 198, according to a spokesman. (In its review, the office, among other things, considers whether the transaction terms are fair and reasonable and if the interests of its members will be promoted by the sale.)\nThe temple\u2019s president, David Britten (Ramabhadra Das), and his board twice asked the Hare Krishna Society\u2019s ecclesiastic directors, known as the Governing Body Commission, for permission to \u201cmove the deities,\u201d which implied a property sale \u2014 once in 1998 and again 2008. Mr. Britten and his board were given approval both times, said Seth Spellman (Sesa Das), a commission member and the head of a group tasked with halting the current sale. But a lack of interest from buyers, and then the financial crisis, held back possible deals.\nAs the economy and the real estate market once again gathered steam, however, it became easier for the board to find a buyer. Two years ago, congregants were shocked to discover that the temple board had signed a sales contract with a developer for $58.8 million.\nPragnesh Surti, 39, a member of the Downtown Brooklyn congregation since childhood, recalled Mr. Britten first mentioning a possible sale during a service in 2014: that the property could fetch $60 million and that it was \u201ca sign from Krishna\u201d that it was meant to happen. In 2015, Mr. Britten told the congregation that the New York State attorney general\u2019s office was reviewing a sales petition. Mr. Surti recalled Mr. Britten envisioning details of the new temple with large domes and Swarovski crystals.\n\u201cMany of us,\u201d Mr. Surti said, \u201cwere like, \u2018Wait, what?\u2019\u201d\nCongregants said they were worried as questions to the board about a temporary location went unanswered. Financial details and architectural plans were not disclosed. People wondered where in Queens land was available. Discord over the sale increased.\nMany members say an existing temple, and more important, the deities that live there, cannot be moved unless there\u2019s an urgent need, as stipulated in Swami Prabhupada\u2019s will. It is sacrilegious, said Shakti Assouline, a 36-year-old yoga instructor and former congregant of the Brooklyn temple who said she is no longer welcome there because of her differing opinion (she prefers to raise money to renovate the building rather than sell it).\n\u201cWe are in an amazing location, which serves our outreach endeavors and is conveniently located for visitors,\u201d Ms. Assouline said.\nAlthough the Hare Krishna Society\u2019s Governing Body Commission had previously approved the sale, it had not been informed that a contract was signed in 2014, or that it was revised in 2015. By this time, Downtown Brooklyn was thriving; giving up the property seemed unwise. So the Commission revoked its previous approval, and in March 2016 it told Mr. Britten to stop the sale, said Mr. Spellman.\nIn the year that followed, commission leaders started to suspect that the Brooklyn temple board was defying its order and was continuing to push the property sale through, Mr. Spellman said. Mr. Britten declined to comment for this article.\nTensions erupted in late July 2017, when the commission tried to remove Mr. Britten from his post after decades of service. He refused to leave the temple, where he lives, or abdicate his position. Instead, he locked the temple doors for several weeks, shuttering Govinda\u2019s as well. Although Sunday services resumed a few weeks later, congregants noticed private security personnel at the door blocking several members who had been vocally against the sale from entering the building.\nThe commission grew more concerned when the large Hare Krishna Society temple sign was removed from the building\u2019s facade in August, leading some to believe that Mr. Britten was disassociating the temple from the society, said Mr. Spellman.\nThe tension, of course, is over which governing entity \u2014 the local temple board, led by Mr. Britten, or the global Hare Krishna Society, led by the Governing Body Commission \u2014 will have control over the millions of dollars from the property sale, if it is allowed to proceed.\nAs usual, when ideals and money are at odds, things get complicated.\nThe temple property is owned by a religious corporation called the Bharati Center Inc., which legally makes the temple board trustees the owners of 295-311 Schermerhorn Street. The Hare Krishna Society was not mentioned in the paperwork when the building was purchased in 1982, because some members of Congregation Mount Sinai, the synagogue that owned the property, had concerns over selling the building to Hare Krishnas, said Mr. Walker. The commission has allowed temples to be purchased under various names before to protect the group from potential legal action, he said. This was one of those cases.\nIf the sale goes forward, the commission is worried that the money will be in the hands of a temple board that no longer seems to be part of the Hare Krishna Society, so it has taken steps to wrestle back control of the temple by forming a new board of trustees, which includes Mr. Surti. But the Brittens, as well as the other board members who are supportive of the sale, continue to exist and operate.\nThe New York State attorney general\u2019s office told the Bharati Center board in September that the multiple proposals it had submitted didn\u2019t meet the legal requirements for approval and that it should find recourse in court. A date has been set for late January at State Supreme Court in Brooklyn.\nDavid G. Samuels, a partner at Duval & Stachenfeld LLP and the attorney representing the society, said there is legal ground for the court not to approve the sale because it is not in the best interest of the temple congregation. Mark J. Weinstein, counsel to Mr. Britten\u2019s temple board, declined to comment.\n\u201cA real estate transaction for religious entities can be very complex,\u201d said Patricia C. Sandison, a senior associate at Hodgson Russ LLP, whose firm is not involved in the sale. \u201cPeople identify themselves with a temple or a church, and it\u2019s a facet of their belief, so selling that property can be very challenging.\u201d\nNikhil Gupta (Nimai Pandit Das), a Hare Krishna follower, said a prolonged court battle should be expected. He would know, since the Hare Krishna Society has been trying to remove him, as well as other leaders of a temple in Freeport, Long Island, for 13 years.\nIn 2004, the commission accused the Long Island leaders, and subsequently Mr. Gupta in 2007, of not following Krishna doctrine. In court filings, the Commission said Mr. Gupta, the current temple president, was deviating from society philosophy and must therefore be removed. Mr. Gupta disputes this claim and said he has many other grievances with the commission\u2019s governance.\nIn October, State Supreme Court in Nassau County ordered Mr. Gupta to vacate the temple premises, but he appealed, and has attained a stay. Mr. Gupta said he will continue his fight to remain as president of the local temple in court.\n\u201cThe society\u2019s penchant for legal battles takes away from the purity of the founder\u2019s teachings,\u201d Mr. Gupta said.\n\nThe fractured Brooklyn congregation has led to the formation of many smaller Hare Krishna groups. Mr. Surti said a group in New Rochelle attracts society members from Westchester, the Bronx and Upper Manhattan, while there are several in Queens, including a Bengali and Gujarati group that meets in Long Island City and Jackson Heights.\nThere are also splinter groups in the city. Cesar Bisono (Gopal Campu Das), 23, tried services at the Downtown Brooklyn temple, but he said he was more attracted to the purity of NYC Harinam, which he joined full time in 2015, he said. The group has 10 devotees, all in their early 20s, who live communally with their mentor in an apartment on the Lower East Side. Their daily lives revolve around chanting and conducting outreach services; they all lead a monastic lifestyle.\nMr. Bisono surmised that NYC Harinam was more akin to how the society was in the early days. \u201cI felt more spiritually inspired by going outside,\u201d he said of his decision not to join the Brooklyn temple. \u201cThis group was more inviting.\u201d\nMike Ramlogan (Sunandana Das), the president of the Hare Krishna Society temple in South Richmond Hill, Queens, has been watching the Brooklyn conflict unfold from afar. He said that both sides seem to be more concerned about the money and haven\u2019t come forth with a vision for the future.\n\u201cWould it be nice to have a big, new temple in Queens? Sure,\u201d Mr. Ramlogan said, noting that the small space he manages can squeeze in only about 100 people during Sunday services.\n\u201cI hope the good souls, the good swamis, put the place back together again. But I\u2019m not exactly sure who they are.\u201d",

    "text": "iPhones, Jemele Hill, Food Memories and Teenage Tattoos: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week\n2017-09-21T22:08:00.000Z\nEach week on our site, we post nine new writing prompts inspired by Times articles or images, and we hear from teenagers all over the world in response. Below, we\u2019ve called out some of the best comments that have come in over the last seven days.\nBut this week, we\u2019re hoping you won\u2019t just rely on the pieces we post, but will also tell us what else you might be reading, watching or listening to in The Times on your own. For a wonderful example of that, read the thoughts of Dominic T-C, below, on a new kind of ice cream engineered to appeal to Indian palates.\nJoin the current events conversation: whatever got your attention in The Times this week, post a comment here and tell us why you noticed it, or tag us on Twitter (@nytimeslearning) with a photo or a comment.\nAny teenager from anywhere in the world is welcome to participate, anytime until next Thursday.\nWe loved not only what Dominic T-C from California had to say about \u201cA Taste of Indian Nostalgia Finds an Eager Audience,\u201d but also the way he said it:\nI love flavors that have some life to them. Flavors as interesting as they are high in calories. Ginger-lime. Praline. Raspberry. Coconut with chunks of fresh mango. They are scrumptious! But flavors, like relationships, don\u2019t matter if you start with a bad base.\nFood scientist Dr. Kanti Parekh gets this. Kwality arrived in India in the 1950s, serving up indulgent, creamy treats. In fact, Dr. Parekh created many of their wildly popular flavors. Intense. Made for Indian taste buds. Seated on a rich base of milk and butterfat. Lots of it. A total success. Then, in 1995, Unilever bought the brand. They cut costs. They changed the base. Watered it down. Sweetened it up. Betrayed their relationship. They cut their flavorist.\nLike the unraveling of a relationship when it\u2019s clear there\u2019s little below the glittering surface, customers moved away. Dr. Parekh landed in New Jersey. Soon, he opened his own ice cream parlor. And lucky for us, Kwality was born anew, even richer \u2014 with a base as creamy and solid and vibrant as its flavors of fresh glowing mango and butterscotch. Successful and delicious. Yes, I love flavors with life. And like a solid friendship, these flavors work because they sit atop a base of quality.\n_________\nNearly 50 comments came in on our question, \u201cHow Has the iPhone Affected Your Life?\u201d with students evenly divided on whether they would purchase the new iPhoneX for $999 \u2014 and on whether smartphones in general are wonderful life-changers, or terrible time-wasters.\nKieran VH from Albany likes his phone:\niPhones have altered my life for the better; they put everything I need for everyday life right into the palm of my hand. An average day without an iPhone would be hectic at best, as many people don\u2019t even know how to use many of the objects that the iPhone has replaced.\nMadison Sim, from WAHS, agreed:\nA little over 100 years ago, the longest distance you could call someone was 3,600 miles. That is just from New York to California. Now, iPhones make it so that you can FaceTime someone across the entire world in seconds, with just a few taps on your phone screen.\nBut Geneva Mellison from WAHS strongly disagrees:\nI think I would be a more talented, and more thoughtful, person if I did not have a phone ... I would prefer if they did not exist. Life might be more difficult in some senses, but the whole realm of friendship and romantic relationships would be totally different. And I believe kids would get their homework done more often and have overall better grades. I think that smartphones have also created a more depressed society. We are lonelier because we spend more time by ourselves on our phones.\nKaity K has been \u201cbrainwashed\u201d:\nI honestly am not sure I could go a whole day without my phone. I am brainwashed by it. My parents say all the time that back in their day they didn\u2019t have phones. They had to communicate to each other, pull out actual maps, and figure out answers on their own!\nAnd Lisett S from KHS, California, wishes for a magical day when all smartphones disappear:\nSometimes, I do wish we could wake up at least one day without any iPhones or smartphones, so that people, especially pre-teens like me, could enjoy one day without using our phones on the table. Maybe just enjoy family.\n_________\nWe received many excellent comments on \u201cWhat Is Your Reaction to the Jemele Hill Controversy?,\u201d chiefly from a group of students in Virginia. \nFirst, though, this comment by Allison O\u2019Malley Graham, from Amarillo, Tex., which sums up what many saw as the main issues, and was recommended by several readers:\nAt its core, I think this is an issue of the extent to which an individual belongs to themselves. By that I mean that we are dealing with two Jemele Hills: Jemele Hill, the person, and Jemele Hill, the ESPN host. It\u2019s the same distinction we make with most public figures. Jemele Hill, off the air and on Twitter, is most definitely acting as her own person. It would be different if she made these comments on the air, where she is operating under ESPN and broadcasting through them, but on Twitter she exists outside of this framework, and so I don\u2019t think that ESPN has any real right (regardless of the law of the land) to discipline her for her words. To box Jemele Hill up and forbid her to have opinions outside of sports denies her free agency as an American, a woman, and an African-American. She isn\u2019t just a sports commentator, she is an African-American in the public eye, and most definitely feels that she has a duty to represent her own concerns as well as the concerns of the African-American community.\nBesides, when you have a president that takes to Twitter to air his personal grievances and launch authoritarian-style attacks on private companies, can we really bring Ms. Hill\u2019s tweets into question?\nThe president and his staff ought be more concerned about why she made these comments, because she surely isn\u2019t the only person thinking this way. Silencing voices may be faster than addressing the issues raising those voices, but it does a lot less for us as a society.\nBut Riley Wyant from Virginia Tech disagrees:\nSports journalists have every right to bring up political issues in the realm of sports. The average sports anchor could take all day, even all week, discussing the Colin Kaepernick controversy, Jerry Sandusky, domestic violence issues in the N.F.L., drug usage with players, and a myriad other technically \u201cpolitical\u201d stories pertaining to sports.\nHowever, Jemele Hill crossed the line last week with the words she chose about the President, and she should know it. It was not just one hiccup of a tweet, but an entire string of unprofessional and reckless comments made on a Twitter account that reflects directly back onto ESPN. Even though the tweets were from her personal account, everyone knows Jemele Hill as the SportsCenter anchor, and she should not have put the ESPN in that position, especially after much ongoing conflict with the reputation of ESPN being seen as too political and leftist nowadays. Of course, many can argue that President Trump tweets the same type of careless and aggressive content. However, Hill purely stooped to his level and acted on her feelings in an unproductive and impulsive way. Don\u2019t like the president? Think he\u2019s a white supremacist? Call your state representatives and other political influences in your area instead of putting your corporation in a bad light.\nMany students who noted that they were from Blacksburg, Va., home of Virginia Tech, made good points. Lauren Farrar writes:\nOne of the most politically divisive questions of our day is whether or not professionals in the sports industry have any place in the diffusion of political thought and protest. In a nation with democratic principles and a governing document that explicitly protects the right to free speech, the answer is simple: Yes, but not without consequences. When Hill tweeted about the president, she accepted many risks, including criticism from the public and a response from her employer... Speech is legally protected, but it is not guaranteed freedom from backlash.\nMany took on the question of whether or not sports and politics should mix. Liam Duchelle says:\nI have been a sports junkie for as long as I can remember. As I have gotten older, I have started becoming more interested in the political world as well. However, I think the two should remain separate. Politics are a very sensitive topic for all of us and for a lot of people, sports is an escape from that and all of the crazy things that are going on in the world right now. Personally when I\u2019m watching SportsCenter and I see something regarding Colin Kaepernick and the N.F.L. protests, I change the channel.\nBut Miguel Pineda disagrees:\nThe notion that sports figures shouldn\u2019t be allowed to talk about politics is one that does not make sense to me. Political figures are allowed to talk about sports, even though in the end they are just a cultural function of our society. Politics is about people. Politics is about REAL life in a certain sense of the word. At the end of one game the world doesn\u2019t change in the same way that when a bill is passed into law, or the stroke of a presidential pen meets paper. Political decisions, actions, and choices that are made have a real substantial effect on the country as a whole.\nZack Perhach adds:\nA personal opinion on whether Ms. Hill\u2019s actions were a fireable offense is irrelevant. This is a matter of policy. Does ESPN have strict social media rules for its employees? Did Ms. Hill\u2019s tweets break those rules? If yes, then fire her; if no, don\u2019t.\nLoren made a comparison between Ms. Hill and Donald Trump as TV personalities:\nIt is difficult to back up Trump\u2019s disappointed comments about Hill\u2019s tweets when he posted similarly spiteful ones toward Obama while he hosted \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d A principle still stands even when correct action is occasionally not taken. Was Trump\u2019s tweet about Obama in October 2012 a fireable offense? Yes. Are Ms. Hill\u2019s tweets a fireable offense? Yes. Were either fired? No.\nMany brought up what they saw as a double standard by ESPN. Cody Davis, also from Blacksburg, said it best:\nI believe ESPN is handling this situation very hypocritically and, as a result, deserves all the blowback they are getting from outlets such as Fox News. The company made no hesitation to fire Colin Cowherd and Curt Schilling when they made provocative comments from the other side of the political spectrum. I do not believe the company \u201cempowers (their) hosts to be provocative,\u201d because they do not \u2014 they empower their hosts to express left-wing, progressive opinions. If this company truly did empower free expression, Cowherd and Schilling would still be employed by ESPN.\nMireya from Palo Alto, Calif. felt Ms. Hill\u2019s actions show \u201cwhy Democrats continue to lose elections\u201d:\nThis is why Democrats continue to lose elections. This is also why most of America doesn\u2019t take \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d seriously. Jemele Hill \u2014 like many of her friends \u2014 is quick to insinuate racism or \u201cwhite nationalism\u201d against those with whom she disagrees. Hill\u2019s rhetoric might go over well in the bluest of blue communities. However, this insinuation is extremely offensive. I would argue that being called a \u201cracist\u201d is as vile and offensive as being labeled a \u201cpedophile,\u201d \u201cwife-beater\u201d or, of course, that vile \u201cn\u201d word. Yet, Hill and other celebrities throw such offensive rhetoric and accusations around with reckless abandon. The goal of organizations like BLM is supposedly respect and equality. How do you gain respect when you disrespect the flag, the national anthem or the President of the United States? I wasn\u2019t a fan of President Obama\u2019s policies. In fact, I found some of them to be terrible. Yes, he was still my president. The same is true with President Trump.\nWe\u2019ll leave you with a comment by macduff15 of Salem, Ore., who makes a larger point:\nIf employers are allowed to sanction employees who make comments on their personal time and through their personal means and on issues unrelated to their employment, no one with a job will be able to express themselves at all. Heck, they couldn\u2019t even write a comment on a N.Y. Times article like I\u2019m doing right now.\n_________\nWe had a great time reading the comments on \u201cWhat Foods Bring Up Special Memories for You?\u201d \u2014 and it was obvious you had fun writing them:\nFor instance, we loved what Allison O\u2019Malley Graham of Amarillo, Tex., had to say:\nI\u2019m an Irish-American dual citizen born in Singapore and raised abroad, so \u2018home\u2019 used to be a difficult concept for me. Not anymore. Home is a gas-station raspberry Popsicle, plucked from the freezer of a Shell gas station in Muscat, Oman. Home is also three years later, eating a raspberry wine-gummy in the back of a four-door Sedan driving through Adelaide, Australia. And again, four years later, five years later, last week, home is eating anything with artificial raspberry flavouring. Whenever I touch the stuff, I\u2019m brought back to my first home, Oman, and every time I\u2019ve felt at home since then.\n... If anything, I try to avoid sullying the memories I attach to the food by avoiding eating it too frequently. I fear that somehow I\u2019ll dilute the feeling raspberry flavours bring. It\u2019s the only food I feel anything for. There is no food I shy away from, nor is there any food I reach for. Just one flavour, artificial as it may be, that makes me feel at home.\nFor Jayden Cook from Albany, Ore., it\u2019s a Cherry Coke. At the end, he poses a good question:\nFor me I drink a 20-ounce Cherry Coke out of a plastic bottle, it takes me back to when I was at preschool one day, and my best friend/cousin was getting picked up early, and I was upset because I did not want him to leave, and then his dad called my mom and she said that he could take me home, because we were neighbors. After that we went to a little store, because it was a long ride, and we all got a Cherry Coke ... My question is, why is it that the Coke connects me to that memory? Why does something so small, that\u2019s not super relevant to the story, make me remember the story better?\nMarileidy from 4D YC-CLIP did a nice job expressing a common thread running throughout many comments \u2014 that food is love:\nHave you ever eaten too much? Have you ever felt that you can\u2019t walk because you ate a lot of food? Five years ago when I was 13 years old, I went to a neighbor\u2019s dinner in my home country. Every year at Christmas in my neighborhood we make this dinner to share and have a nice time with all our neighbors. The dinner is always full of love, hope, neighborliness, and a lot of food.\nThe food was so good that night and I hadn\u2019t eaten the whole day ... That night I was in the front of the house receiving all the people who were coming to the dinner and taking them to the backyard. It was a big and beautiful backyard. When I was done with my work I sat at my table and started eating the food which was so good and tasty. I couldn\u2019t stop eating so at the end of the night I couldn\u2019t get up from my seat. I have never eaten like that since that night. I miss my people.\nMahir from 4D YC-CLIP expresses the same sentiment movingly:\nI remember the time back in my country when I use to visit my grandma she always used to make a special pickle, we call it \u201cboroi achar.\u201d This was the best pickle for me in the whole wide world. My grandma was very lovely, she always loved me so much. Sometimes I used to eat too much and hide under the bed then she\u2019d hide the pickle from me, and I would go look for it and steal it. Then she would come run after me and yell \u201cyou\u2019re going to have bad stomach day.\u201d\nAfter coming to America two years later my Grandma passed away, and that was the saddest day of my life ... Whenever I go back to Bangladesh it brings back all the memories.\n_________\nOur question \u201cWhat Do American Values Mean to You?,\u201d based on an Op-Ed by former Vice President Joe Biden, yielded some thoughtful answers:\nJackie in Missouri referenced America\u2019s founding documents and said:\nTo me, being an American means that, whether or not you were born in this country, whether or not you are part of the 1% or the 99%, no matter what race you are, what gender you are, or whether or not your ancestors came here in the 17th Century or the 21st or at any time in between, being an American means that you faithfully adhere to the ideals of the United States. Namely, that all people are created equal, that we all have freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom to speak truth to power, freedom of religion, freedom to vote according to our consciences, freedom to resist tyranny and oppression and all of the other freedoms enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\nyle Rouzaud in Oregon spoke from the heart:\nHow would I define the values of an American? I believe to be an American you have to be born and raised in America, and throughout your life you have to obey the laws and respect the government\u2019s decisions.\nTo be an American you have to take pride in your country, you can\u2019t be ashamed. An American has to be willing to announce that you are a citizen in the U.S. who follows the countries requirements.\nAmerica and the citizens who live within the country are known to be independent. We are known to solve conflicts ourselves without assists of others.\nAmerica is looked up to among other countries, this is because we are not in poverty, we have law in order, and we have citizens who respect each others\u2019 differences.\nWe are a united country, and we hope to spread that unity around the world.\nMeghan in Albany changed her answer after reading the article:\nReading this did change my initial answer I gave to the question of what American values mean to me. I thought of them more individually as opposed to them being suggested as more global. American values to me means being united as a country. It means standing up for what we believe isn\u2019t right. It means coming to agreement on decisions that could have big impacts.\n_________\nMany commented on the question, \u201cHow Should the Problem of Sexual Assault on Campuses Be Addressed?,\u201d including a few who have been victims of sexual assault themselves.\nCaroline King, a medical student, reflected on her own roles, both as a student now and a physician in the future:\nAs medical students, we are entrusted to advocate for our patients\u2019 health from the first day of school. And yet, after stepping out of a lecture to listen to Ms. DeVos\u2019s speech, I rejoined my peers wondering who is tasked with ensuring I can safeguard my own health on campus. Ms. DeVos\u2019s focus is not on protecting me or my classmates.\nWith changes ahead, I will work to ask my school to maintain its commitment to both complainants and respondents, as has been done successfully at some but not all schools under current policies. I will continue to read comments of those in favor of and opposed to D.O.E. decisions as I try to understand why the narrative of this conversation is changing. This prompt asks which of the NYT\u2019s political writers opinions strikes a chord; the collective silencing of survivors\u2019 voices in reporting from nearly every major paper including the NYT has left a ringing in my ears I am still working to quiet.\nAs I try to become the best physician I can, I place some degree of my own well being in my institution\u2019s hands by becoming a student. My school is helping me build a framework to deliver trusting and compassionate care to patients. When the 2011 DCL guidelines fall, I will ask my school to use this framework in deciding where they stand on sexual assault. Student activists across the US are preparing for this fight; I know we are ready to work to protect each other regardless of what lies ahead.\nJordyn from Lockwood, Ore. writes from the point of view of someone who has experienced sexual assault:\nAs someone who has personally experienced sexual assault, I think that there should be justice. However, I completely understand false accusations and believe that both sides deserve some form of legal support. Regardless of what new rules are set in place to \u201cprotect\u201d students, sexual assault will still continue to happen. Whether or not it is reported is the question.\nBell Krebs was clear in her support for victims, saying:\nIndividuals who come out about sexual violence experience outrageous amounts of disrespect and victim-shaming. These changes could keep more victims from coming out about their experiences for fear that what happened to them would not respected. There are very few cases of lying and false accusations of sexual violence, so there needs to be an encouraging environment that what happened will be heard.\nGracie Bakie of West Albany High School writes about how to keep the process as fair as it can be:\nWhile DeVos has good intentions of keeping innocent people from being convicted of sexual assault or rape, it needs to be kept in mind that this must be dealt with in an extremely careful manner. This issue should not be an issue dealt with exclusively by schools and their guidelines but by a proper process by law. Only after the accused are proven guilty should their privileges be revoked. That being said, guilty offenders should not receive any privileges from their schools, now matter their skill level in sports, academics, or any extra curricular activities. Also, as well as making sure defendants receive the correct representation, DeVos needs to keep in mind the fragile state a victim will be in and how unlikely it is for women to come forward if they\u2019re less likely to get justice ... If DeVos gives more support to either side, she is not interested in keeping campuses and students a safe place for education.\n_________\nSeveral comments came in on Who Should Decide Whether a Teenager Can Get a Tattoo or Piercing? We were especially interested in the conversation between these two students \u2014 and would love for more of you to read and respond to each other this way.\nLazuli Roth of Denver writes:\nFirst thing to consider before piercing your tongue is that it is lifelong, and second is that it can cause the worst halitosis (bad breath) possible. The third consideration is that relative to other body parts, the tongue will not \u2018regenerate\u2019 and the hole will be there until death. Fourth thing to consider is that the body was not born with a hole in the tongue, so why would you change that, as an existential question. Lastly, for now, consider what may happen to the money spent if you just saved it rather than spent it on a painful experience \u2014 oh wait! For real, lastly, consider the pain involved! That makes seven things to consider.\nAsa V of New York replied:\nLazuli, no. A quick Google search reveals that tongue piercings heal remarkably quickly and are not permanent. \u201cThe body was not born with a hole in the tongue, so why change that\u201d \u2014 Why do you get a haircut? Why do we wear clothes? Why do we disconnect umbilical cords? C\u2019mon, now. What if we saved the money and spared ourselves the painful experience? I ask myself the same thing when I go to the dentist. Obviously the receiver of the piercing considers it worth the pain. If they don\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t really matter, because that means they\u2019ve already been impaled by a needle and it\u2019s too late to go back. Childbirth, on the other hand, drags on! Consider that pain! Why do people have babies? Like most things: different strokes for different folks.\n_________\nPlease note: All comments have been lightly edited for length and clarity.",

Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets.\n\u2022 A giant statue of Lt. Gen. Mikhail Kalashnikov, the creator of the AK-47, was unveiled in Moscow in a ceremony that made no mention of the millions killed and wounded by the world\u2019s most prevalent assault weapon.

[The New York Times]\n\u2022 More than 2 million people in Japan are above the age of 90, leading some experts to call for a new definition for the term \u201celderly.\u201d [The Japan Times]\n\u2022 Our Washington reporter  describes how he landed a recent political scoop: by overhearing a conversation of Trump legal advisers at a Washington steakhouse. [The New York Times]\n\u2022 In New Zealand, screenings of Disney\u2019s \u201cMoana\u201d in te reo M\u0101ori, the language of the indigenous Maori, sold out quickly, bolstering efforts to keep the tongue relevant.

The Times introduced readers to pizza 73 years ago today as \u201ca pie made from a yeast dough and filled with any number of different centers.\u201d\n\u201cWith the dexterity of a drum major wielding a baton, the baker picks one up and twirls it around, first in one hand and then in the other,\u201d the report said, describing Luigino\u2019s Pizzeria Alla Napoletana in Times Square.\nIn the early 1800s, Naples was famous for working poor, the lazzaroni. Pizza was the answer to their need for quick and cheap food. Antica Pizzeria Port\u2019Alba opened in Naples in 1830 and is widely thought to be the world\u2019s first pizzeria.\nWhen Neapolitans began migrating in large numbers to the U.S., they brought their tradition of wood-oven bakeries. The first U.S. pizzeria opened in New York in 1905.\nSome things have changed. Pizza is now embedded in much of the world\u2019s culinary fabric. (Last week, our dining critic proposed that Jersey City actually has New York\u2019s best pizza.)\nBut the gluttony pizza can inspire is enduring.\n\u201cEach one will make four portions,\u201d the original 1944 introduction said. \u201cAlthough many people can do away with a whole pie single-handed.\u201d\nRemy Tumin contributed reporting.\n_____\nYour Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

    "text": "Mike Pence, Uber, Greece: Your Tuesday Briefing\n2017-02-21T05:06:11.000Z\nGood morning.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\n\u2022 An 11-person team of diplomats and former journalists is Europe\u2019s front line against an onslaught of fake news. But their task has proved overwhelming.\nMany recent false reports have targeted politicians who oppose closer ties with Russia, while others seek to portray refugees as criminals, fomenting populist anger.\nPresident Trump stood by his attack on Sweden\u2019s migration policies, doubling down on his suggestion that refugees had caused a surge in crime there. Statistics do not support Mr. Trump\u2019s claims, and the Swedes were flabbergasted.\nAbove, Syrian refugees in Denmark on their way to Sweden.\n_____\n\u2022 Vice President Mike Pence told E.U. leaders in Brussels that the White House fully supported European institutions, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s critical comments about them.\nBritain\u2019s House of Commons debated an online petition signed by more than 1.8 million people that called for denying Mr. Trump a formal state visit.\n_____\n\u2022 Mr. Trump chose a widely respected military strategist, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, above, as his new national security adviser.\nMr. Trump\u2019s defense secretary, Jim Mattis, is touring the Middle East. He sought to play down the president\u2019s remark last month that the U.S. should have \u201ckept\u201d Iraq\u2019s oil after the 2003 invasion.\nSome Arab allies are alarmed over a proposal by the Trump administration to designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization.\n_____\n\u2022 Ukraine reacted furiously to a peace plan secretly put forward by two Trump associates and a Ukrainian lawmaker that seemed to advance Russian interests. The Kremlin denied knowledge of the plan.\nComplicating peace talks, Russia issued a decree recognizing passports issued by two separatist governments in eastern Ukraine.\nAnd the Kremlin is stirring tensions in former Yugoslav republics.

    "text": "Shaky Jobs, Sluggish Wages: Reasons Are at Home\n2017-02-28T14:38:44.000Z\nPresident Trump hasn\u2019t been saving jobs in the last few weeks, focusing his energy (and Twitter feed) on how to close the borders to immigrants instead.\nWhen he gets back to it, he might spend less time on the workers putting together air-conditioning units in Indiana and more \u2014 a lot more \u2014 on the maids and janitors who clean Trump golf resorts and hotels.\nThis is not to accuse the president of being hypocritical by skewering companies that move production overseas while, say, selling Trump merchandise made in Bangladesh, or loudly championing the cause of the working man while refusing to recognize the rights of workers at his branded properties.\nRather, it is to argue that by obsessing over how the manufacturing jobs of the 1970s were lost to globalization, Mr. Trump is missing a more critical workplace transformation: the vast outsourcing of many tasks \u2014 including running the cafeteria, building maintenance and security \u2014 to low-margin, low-wage subcontractors within the United States.\nThis reorganization of employment is playing a big role in keeping a lid on wages \u2014 and in driving income inequality \u2014 across a much broader swath of the economy than globalization can account for.\nDavid Weil, a professor of management at the Questrom School of Business at Boston University who headed the Labor Department\u2019s wage and hour division at the end of the Obama administration, calls this process the \u201cfissuring\u201d of the workplace. He traces it to the 1980s, when corporations under pressure to raise quarterly profits started shedding \u201cnoncore\u201d tasks.\nThe trend grew as the spread of information technology made it easier for companies to standardize and monitor the quality of outsourced work. Many employers took to outsourcing to avoid the messy consequences \u2014 like unions and workplace regulations \u2014 of employing workers directly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly important part of the story that we haven\u2019t paid attention to,\u201d Mr. Weil told me.\n\u201cLead businesses \u2014 the firms that continue to directly employ workers who provide the goods and services in the economy recognized by consumers \u2014 remain highly profitable and may continue to provide generous pay for their work force,\u201d he noted. \u201cThe workers whose jobs have been shed to other, subordinate businesses face far more competitive market conditions.\u201d\nThe trend is hard to measure, since subcontracting can take many forms. But it is big. A study last year by Lawrence F. Katz of Harvard and Alan B. Krueger of Princeton, a former chief economic adviser to President Barack Obama, concluded that independent contractors, on-call workers and workers provided by contracting companies or temp agencies accounted altogether for 94 percent of employment growth over the last 10 years.\nNonstandard employment arrangements like these account for nearly one in six jobs today. That is 24 million jobs, nine million more than 10 years ago.\nMany of these jobs are poorly paid. A 2008 study by Arindrajit Dube of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and Ethan Kaplan, then at the Institute for International Economic Studies at Stockholm University, found that outsourcing imposed a wage penalty of up to 7 percent for janitors and up to 24 percent for security guards.\nThe Government Accountability Office of Congress concluded that contingent workers in the education field \u2014 substitute teachers, adjuncts and the like \u2014 earn almost 14 percent less per hour. In retailing they earn 9.4 percent less. Contingent workers across the board are less likely to have health insurance. One-third live in families making less than $20,000 a year. That is three times the share of workers employed in standard full-time jobs.\nThe rise of outsourced work adds an important twist to the standard understanding of America\u2019s growing wage inequality, which is based on the notion that technology has left less-educated workers behind \u2014 taking over their routine jobs while opening lucrative new possibilities for the better-educated.\nThe sorting of workers into different classes of companies will further widen the earnings gap as the rewards of the most profitable among them \u201cincreasingly go to a more limited group of highly compensated and more-educated workers and to shareholders,\u201d Professor Katz explained.\nManufacturing has gone through this process. General Motors in its heyday employed more than 600,000 workers in the United States, including the engineer, the man sweeping the shop floor and the woman serving coffee. Though the engineer certainly earned much more, the other two could share in G.M.\u2019s success. Norms of fairness, Mr. Weil argues, would limit the wage gap between workers of a single company, giving a boost to those at the bottom.\nOutsourcing does away with such considerations. Apple is as successful as G.M. was in its time. But it employs fewer than 70,000 people in the United States. While it keeps engineers, designers and such in house, it doesn\u2019t bother with workers not critical to creating seductive new gadgets. Many of those work for Foxconn, in Asia, where the margins are slimmer and the pay is not as good.\nThe trend is not unique to manufacturing nor to outsourcing overseas, though. It is happening across the nation\u2019s brick-and-mortar workplaces and coursing through service industries, the fastest-growing segment of the labor market.\nThese days the receptionist at the front desk is unlikely to work for the hotel. The truck driver may not work for the delivery company, nor the nurse for the hospital. Jobs in coal mining and hydraulic fracturing \u2014 even shipbuilding \u2014 have been siphoned off.\nThough the gig economy is still small \u2014 employing 0.5 percent of contingent workers, according to Professors Katz and Krueger \u2014 the technologies powering it are likely to fissure the American workplace further.\nThis sorting would increase the slice of national income going to shareholders and reduce workers\u2019 share. The pattern is consistent with evidence that most of the widening of the nation\u2019s earnings inequality can be explained by growing pay gaps between organizations rather than within them.\nOver all, Professor Katz estimates, the sorting of workers into high- and low-end employers accounts for a quarter to a third of the increase of wage inequality in the United States since 1980.\nSo can Mr. Trump do anything about this? When at the Labor Department, Mr. Weil argued that companies that outsource should share liability with subcontractors for wages and working conditions, so they could not simply wash their hands of responsibility.\nIt\u2019s not an easy problem to fix, though. As Mr. Weil puts it, \u201cHow do you reattach some of the responsibility to the engine of value of these network business systems?\u201d Companies will continue to seek efficiencies by shunting work into these broader networks. And it would make little sense to adopt policies that forbid this kind of business organization. Encouraging unions, which many scholars have suggested as a tool to improve wage growth, could well accelerate the splintering.\nAnd yet, there may be a place for incentives to discourage the weakening of labor standards. Some employers might adopt a system like Harvard\u2019s parity policy to ensure that those in contract positions like guards or cafeteria workers get the same pay and benefits as comparable university staff members.\nWhatever its difficulties, addressing the vast transformation underway in the organization of work seems more relevant than tilting at windmills in hopes of restoring American manufacturing to its 1950s state.",

The ruling is likely to restrict the company from expanding its services.\n\u2022 When the Winklevoss twins invested their Facebook settlement in Bitcoin, many snickered.

South Korean cameras recorded the escape.\nAnd North Korea called the Trump administration\u2019s imposition of new punishments \u2014 restoring the North to the U.S. list of terrorism sponsors and yet more sanctions \u2014 a \u201cserious provocation.\u201d\nIn the U.S., the death of an American who had been held in harsh conditions by the North in 2010 raised concerns that he had committed suicide.\n_____\n\u2022 Security forces in Papua New Guinea stormed a controversial detention center on Manus Island, in an attempt to end a standoff that has drawn international scrutiny to Australia\u2019s refugee policy.\nThe authorities destroyed belongings in the men\u2019s shelters and announced on a loudspeaker that the men had to leave for alternative facilities on the island. The camp was officially closed on Oct. 31, with electricity, food and water being cut off as hundreds of asylum seekers refused to leave.\nLeft, a photo taken by a refugee on Manus Island and released by an Australian activist group.\nThe Times recently sent journalists to visit the Manus Island camp as well as the new facilities the men are supposed to move to.

Eight were rescued and said to be in good condition.\nIt was the fifth accident this year for the Seventh Fleet, the Navy\u2019s largest overseas fleet, and the weight of repeated tragedy was reflected on its Facebook page. \u201cThis year needs to be over already,\u201d a post said. \u201c7th fleet can\u2019t handle any more curse.\u201d\n_____\n\u2022 Europe closed what may be its most shameful chapter of bloodletting since World War II.\nAfter a trial that lasted years, the Bosnian Serb warlord Ratko Mladic was sentenced to life in prison by a U.N. tribunal. He was convicted of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity in the slaughter of Bosnian Muslims during the breakup of Yugoslavia, including the mass executions of 8,000 men and boys in Srebrenica.\nOur reporters note that European nationalist passions are once again on the rise.\n\u2022 From Washington, a tangled message: U.S. regulators\u2019 plan to end net neutrality expands the powers of major internet providers, while a suit to block AT&T\u2019s merger with Time Warner reins one in.\n\u2022 In a high-profile auction on Alibaba\u2019s Taobao auction site, the Chinese carrier SF Airlines bought two Boeing 747s for $48 million.\n\u2022 China\u2019s biggest pork companies are racing to build vast hog farms in the northeastern cornbelt, reshaping the country\u2019s $1 trillion pork market.\n\u2022 Uber\u2019s revelation that hackers stole 57 million accounts, that it paid a ransom, and that the breach and deal were kept secret for a year raises new questions about Travis Kalanick, the former chief executive who remains on the board.\n\u2022 Unregulated exchanges for digital currencies have popped up in South Korea and other spots.

This year, there will be more than 8,000 participants, including many performers and clowns.\nBut the act of parading, a ceremony that dates to the earliest human civilizations, isn\u2019t always about fun.\nThe Romans celebrated their military triumphs with parades \u2014 all chariots, plundered loot and captured slaves.\nAs an expression of raw imperial power, it\u2019s tough to beat the Prussians, who introduced the goose step to parades in the 17th century. That same martial precision can be found in modern military parades in Russia, China and North Korea.\nThese days, parades around the world inspire exuberance, pride \u2014 and often eccentricity. Aside from the wild parades of Mardi Gras and Carnival, there\u2019s the annual Pikachu parade in Yokohama, Japan, and the Vienna Love Parade in Austria.\nOne of the oddest events of recent years: a parade in the Netherlands in which enthusiasts recreate the phantasmagorical paintings of Hieronymus Bosch, the 15th-century Dutch artist.\n_____\nYour Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

    "text": "A Voice From Paris on Climate Change\n2017-04-01T14:00:04.000Z\nAnne Hidalgo, mayor of Paris, is also chairwoman of C40, a network of the world\u2019s biggest cities committed to addressing climate change. As mayor, despite strong opposition, she has closed parts of the city \u2014 including along the bank of the Seine River \u2014 to traffic. Recently, I asked Ms. Hidalgo about her interest in environmental issues and why women are important to the solutions. Her answers have been edited and condensed.\n\nHow did you get interested in environment and climate change issues?\n\nAir pollution was the issue that first alerted me to the importance of taking bold action to protect Parisians. Pollution created by heavy traffic has always been a challenge for big cities like Paris. When I was a deputy mayor between 2001 and 2008, Paris made a lot of progress by creating the V\u00e9lib\u2019 bike sharing system, one of the first in any major city in the world, and the Autolib\u2019 electric car hire system. When I was in charge of urban planning, we pedestrianized the first section of the bank of the Seine, from the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay to the Eiffel Tower. This was disruptive at the time, but today Parisians and Paris lovers can\u2019t imagine this iconic landscape as a road anymore.\n\nWe know you\u2019ve introduced \u201cParis Respire.\u201d What does that involve? What else have you done in this area, and what do you hope to do in the future?\n\nParis Respire is the reclaiming of the streets of Paris, for the enjoyment of pedestrians \u2014 the adults and especially the children \u2014 and the cyclists. Some of the city\u2019s most iconic areas, including Le Marais, Montmartre and the Canal St.-Martin, are closed to all vehicles on Saturdays and/or Sundays. This showed to Parisians what it meant to live and commute alternatively. They were given the opportunity, for the first time in living memory, to experience a healthier and more peaceful city, breathing a cleaner air.\nAnd we do even more now. Every first Sunday of the month, the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es is also closed to vehicles. Most recently, we pedestrianized a second section of the bank of the Seine, between Les Tuileries and Sully-Morland, creating a wonderful new space for Parisians and those who love Paris, to enjoy.\nWe also launched \u201cReinventing our squares.\u201d This began with the Place de la R\u00e9publique, which was one of the most dangerous or unpleasant places to visit as a cyclist or pedestrian. Today, most of the square is reserved for these users. Our plans are now to expand this initiative to seven more squares.\n\nWhat are the biggest contributors to the pollution problems in Paris?\n\nThere are no surprises here. It is cars, particularly the oldest ones. Tourist buses also contribute significantly. All diesel vehicles cause particular problems because the pollution from these is the most damaging to human health. That is why, with the mayor of Mexico City, we announced that we will ban all diesel vehicles from our cities by 2025.\nAll cars entering Paris must display a colored sticker called Crit\u2019Air, indicating the age of the vehicle, engine size and emissions.\nIn order to provide alternatives to private car use, since I became mayor we have expanded the V\u00e9lib\u2019 bike hire system to more than 14,000 bikes. The Cityscoot system allows people to rent an electric scooter from their smartphone, making millions of journeys each year with zero emissions. We will also launch the SeaBubbles in Paris this year: These flying taxis over the River Seine will offer another transportation alternative.\n\nHow has being a woman hindered \u2014 or helped \u2014 you as a mayor of a major city and a leader in environmental causes?\n\nThe fact is that women have to work 10 times harder to get the same opportunities as men. And they have then 10 times less the right to fail.\nFor a long time, women were working on environmental issues, because men were not interested in them. It was seen as a career dead-end. And despite that attitude, an incredible group of powerful women succeeded in delivering one of the greatest diplomatic achievements in history, when more than 170 nations signed the Paris Agreement on climate change. It has truly inspired a new generation of young women and men to help tackle the climate crisis.\n\nDo you see all environmental issues as being especially a women\u2019s issue, or specifically climate change?\n\nAll these issues are humanity\u2019s issues but they are impacting women more. I\u2019ll give you some examples of their higher vulnerability when facing the potential catastrophes of climate change. In 1991 in Bangladesh, 90 percent of the 150,000 people killed in the cyclone were women, because they were more likely to be at home. Women in New Orleans experienced an average loss of earnings of 7 percent in the year after Katrina, a 14 percent loss for African-American women, while men experienced a 23 percent gain in earnings.\nIn many communities, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, about half the women are still working in agriculture. Agriculture is uniquely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, leaving millions of women around the world, and the family members who rely on them for their wages and food, at risk because of the changing climate.\n\nAt the conference, people talked about women being more sensitive, more caring, more collaborative, and therefore more able to negotiate ways to attack climate change. Some critics would say that even though the idea to is enhance the role of women, these are traditional, and perhaps even sexist, ways to view women. How would you respond to that?\n\nThe challenges our societies are facing while tackling climate change are enormous. And I\u2019m convinced that we will all need to show courage, creativity and solidarity. These aren\u2019t traits that are unique to women, but our life experience is different than that of men. For a long time, the life experience of women has been denied, and now it is time to consider what those experiences can bring. An inspiring group of powerful women managed to deliver the Paris Agreement, after years of dead ends and false hopes, they delivered it.\nIn my experience, the successful men that I have met have not lacked confidence in their abilities. Through the Women4Climate initiative we are asking young, talented and potentially powerful women to believe in their abilities, believe in their chance, because our planet needs them.\n\nWhat challenges do you see in light of President Trump\u2019s sharply differing views of climate change compared with those of President Barack Obama?\n\nWhatever happens at the White House, I am convinced that together, cities, businesses and citizens will save the planet. Their alliance is critical. We know there is no alternative. We know that if we don\u2019t act now, our citizens will never forgive us.\nAt the last C40 Mayors Summit in Mexico City, it was inspiring to see a group of mayors from American cities come together and repeat their determination to deliver on the Paris Agreement, regardless of what happens at the federal level. As my very good friend Muriel Bowser, mayor of Washington, D.C., said at that event, \u201cOne election does not change who we are in cities in America.\u201d\nMy message to the cities of America and to the women of America is that there are millions of us around the world who will stand by their side in the fight against populism, against climate change and against the forces that would hold you back. You can count on us.",

    "text": "Protect Alaska\u2019s Last Great Wilderness From Oil Drilling\n2017-10-18T08:55:13.000Z\nFew landscapes remain virtually untrammeled by the growing impact of the planet\u2019s seven and a half billion inhabitants \u2014 places where the natural environment is so overwhelmingly intact and truly wild that coming across so much as a boot print is a surprise. It seems unlikely in this day and age, but such areas do still exist.\nThe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one such place. Lies and misrepresentations have characterized this Arctic region as a \u201cbarren wasteland.\u201d In fact, this is a landscape of surprising beauty and biological diversity: 31,000 square miles of the craggy Brooks Range, valleys of spruce forest and flower-filled tundra extending north to the Arctic Ocean.\nIn this terrain and the adjacent Arctic Ocean, you\u2019ll find roughly 700 kinds of plants and a multitude of different species: 200 bird, 47 mammal and 42 fish species. It\u2019s a place of living grandeur.\nThose of us who have explored the Arctic refuge treasure seeing grizzly bears, wolves, Dall sheep and thundering herds of caribou. With awe we have watched golden eagles and flocks of migrating birds from across the globe, many of which nest there in the summer after a winter spent in such faraway places as the Amazon, the coastal wetlands of Patagonia or the Sundarbans mangrove swamps of Bangladesh.\nYet this stunning landscape is now in the cross hairs of the United States Congress. Republicans are using the budget reconciliation process to allow oil drilling in the refuge in order to generate revenue to offset the cost of tax reform. This expedited process allows Republicans in the Senate, where they hold a narrow edge, to pass a reconciliation bill with a simple majority, bypassing a filibuster from the Democrats. This is not the way we should consider a measure that threatens irreversible damage to our wilderness heritage.\nThe refuge was originally suggested for protection in the early 1950s, when Alaska was not yet a state. To investigate its conservation value, Olaus Murie, the president of the Wilderness Society, and his wife, Mardy, who both had spent years in Alaska, suggested a biological survey to Fairfield Osborn, president of the New York Zoological Society (now the Wildlife Conservation Society). The Sheenjek River Valley and surrounding areas on the southern slopes of the Brooks Range were selected as the focus of the expedition.\nIn the summer of 1956 the Muries and a team \u2014 consisting of the ornithologist Brina Kessel from the University of Alaska, along with graduate students Robert Krear and one of us (Dr. Schaller) \u2014 roamed these remote mountains. They made lists of plants and animals and absorbed, in Olaus Murie\u2019s words, \u201cthe precious intangible values\u201d of the place.\nAs early as 1952, Dr. Schaller noted that oil development had already begun in northern Alaska. He wrote the secretary of interior, Fred Seaton, warning that unless the region were shielded from development it \u201cmay in future years resemble one of the former Texas oil fields.\u201d\nIn 1960, the Eisenhower administration established the nearly nine million acre Arctic National Wildlife Range to preserve \u201cthe unique wildlife, wilderness and recreational values\u201d of this landscape.\nCongress and the Carter administration doubled the size of the refuge, to 18 million acres, in 1980 under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, renaming the area as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. (With an addition, it is now 19.6 million acres.) Native people retained their hunting rights, and licensed trophy hunters were permitted to kill Dall sheep and caribou.\nThe refuge also includes the 1.5 million acre \u201c1002 area\u201d adjoining the Arctic Ocean. This swath of coastal plain is thought to be rich in oil and gas, and even though vast portions of the Arctic slope and coastal waters of northern Alaska are open for oil leasing and drilling, the Trump administration, and oil interests and their allies in Congress want to invade and squander this pristine area, which takes up less than 5 percent of the coastal plain.\nThis part of the Arctic slope extending northward from the Brooks Range to the Arctic Ocean is a critical site for polar bears to make their dens and give birth. It is also the calving ground of America\u2019s largest caribou herd, which migrates widely through the region. The Gwich\u2019in Indians of Arctic Village in the Brooks Range and the Inupiat of Kaktovik on the coastal plain depend on the animal for food and clothing.\nThe Gwich\u2019in call the calving area that oil companies hope to develop \u201cthe sacred place where life begins.\u201d As Trimble Gilbert, chief of Arctic Village, said: \u201cWe hurt because we see the land being destroyed,\u201d and added that \u201cwe believe we have something to teach the world about living a simple life, about sharing, about protecting the land.\u201d\nOn the 50th anniversary of the Murie expedition in 2006, the explorer and author Jonathan Waterman organized a return trip to the Arctic refuge. We joined the team, along with graduate students Forrest McCarthy and Betsy Young.\nIt was exhilarating for Dr. Schaller to return after 50 years and still find no roads, no buildings, no garbage. On the Sheenjek River, even an eagle nest he had seen on a cliff in 1956 was still there. Arctic loons still called near our camp on Last Lake, and caribou continued to meander across the coastal plain as we floated first the Canning and then the Hula Hula Rivers.\nOn this trip, we visited the famous Prudhoe Bay oil field on the Arctic slope. After a major petroleum discovery in 1968, an 800-mile pipeline was constructed to transport oil to southern Alaska. Oil started flowing in 1977. Look at Prudhoe Bay and all its satellite fields now. Those who treasure the splendor of industrial sprawl must visit this morass of pipe lines, buildings drilling rigs, gravel pits, roads and pools of toxic chemicals.\nPrudhoe Bay is the largest oil field in North America and one of the top 20 globally. It has undoubtedly brought wealth and prosperity to Alaska, but spills of oil and chemicals, large and small, take place each year. Various laws require that this region be cleaned up once the oil has been exhausted. But who will pay for that in this pro-development world is anyone\u2019s guess.\nThe Arctic refuge must continue to be preserved as a symbol of America\u2019s natural heritage. It remains a healthy ecosystem supporting wildlife, and native peoples as they adapt to profound climate-related changes. True wilderness holds a spiritual value that can nourish us.

    "text": "Preparing Young Americans for a Complex World\n2017-02-08T08:21:16.000Z\nLast year, the Council on Foreign Relations and National Geographic commissioned a survey to assess the global literacy of American college students. Over 1,200 people participated; less than 30 percent earned a passing grade. Below are six questions they included, each of which a majority of respondents answered incorrectly. See how you, or your students or children, do. (Answers below.)\n1. In which of these countries is a majority of the population Muslim?\na) South Africa\nb) Armenia\nc) India\nd) Indonesia\n2. Which language is spoken by the most people in the world as their primary language?\na) Russian\nb) Mandarin Chinese\nc) English\nd) Arabic\n3. Which country is the largest trading partner of the United States, based on the total dollar value of goods and services?\na) Canada\nb) China\nc) Mexico\nd) Saudi Arabia\n4. Approximately what percentage of the United States federal budget is spent on foreign aid?\na) 1 percent\nb) 5 percent\nc) 12 percent\nd) 30 percent\ne) 40 percent\n5. Which countries is the United States bound by treaty to protect if they are attacked? (select all that apply)\na) Canada\nb) China\nc) Japan\nd) Mexico\ne) North Korea\nf) Russia\ng) South Korea\nh) Turkey\n6. True or False: Over the past five years, the number of Mexicans leaving the United States and returning to Mexico has been greater than the number of Mexicans entering the United States.\nWhy is it so important to understand the world and the United States\u2019 role in it today?\nTo begin with, the American economy is inextricably linked to the global economy. It\u2019s estimated that one-fifth of jobs here are now tied to international trade. Moreover, many of the world\u2019s major challenges \u2014 climate change, instability in financial markets, food and water insecurity, infectious diseases, migration, war and terrorism \u2014 are complex, interdependent and borderless. And with 40 million foreign-born residents, the United States is itself a global society with deep emotional ties to many nations and cultures. To survive and thrive, Americans have to learn how to manage greater complexity and collaborate across lines of difference.\nDuring the Obama administration, the federal Department of Education recognized this imperative. Since 2012, its strategy has emphasized \u201cglobal and cultural competency\u201d as a core educational priority. In 2018, the Program for International Student Assessment, an international testing system that sets benchmarks for student performance in which the Department of Education participates, will add global competence as a new domain.\nNevertheless, many American schools have remained poorly prepared to deliver education in \u201cglobal competence\u201d (defined by American education leaders as \u201cthe capacity and disposition to understand and act on issues of global significance.\u201d) The focus on traditional achievement and test scores has narrowed the delivery of instruction at a time when students need to learn to think more broadly. In the wake of \u201cBrexit\u201d and the election of Donald Trump (both far more popular among older voters than among the young) \u2014 and amid the global rise of nationalist movements \u2014 schools need to help students navigate the forces shaping the world they will inherit.\n\u201cWhat are the values, attitudes, skills and behaviors that must be cultivated if we\u2019re going to live in a peaceful world?\u201d asked Dana Mortenson, one of the -founders of World Savvy, an organization that has worked with thousands of teachers to integrate global competence into their lessons.\nWhat\u2019s needed is not just scoring well on standardized tests. \u201cIt\u2019s an openness to new opportunities and ideas,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s a desire to engage. It\u2019s self-awareness about culture and respect for different perspectives. It\u2019s comfort with ambiguity. It\u2019s the skill to investigate the world through questions. Empathy and humility are big pieces of all of it.\u201d\nTeaching these higher-level skills and attitudes might seem a tall order for schools that struggle with the basics. But World Savvy has seen impressive results among its partner schools, a majority of them in high-poverty areas. By raising the bar, teachers say, it becomes easier to engage students.\nThat\u2019s been the experience of Carla Kelly, a special-education teacher at DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx who completed a Global Competence Certificate, a 15-month graduate-level program developed by World Savvy, the Asia Society and Teachers College at Columbia University.\n\u201cI saw that I needed to teach so that my students could contribute anywhere in the world,\u201d Kelly said.\nKelly teaches a variety of subjects \u2014 including science, health, Spanish and life skills \u2014 in a school that has students and faculty members from 46 countries. She tries to integrate global competence concepts throughout her teaching.\nIn a unit on nutrition, for instance, students explore foods from around the world, graphing diets against life spans. \u201cWe compared diets high in starchy vegetables with places where they eat dark green or sea vegetables,\u201d she said. The connections the students drew were powerful: They learned that people in China live longer than black people in America. They discovered that wherever the American diet was introduced, life spans declined.\nIn a unit on death, Kelly added an exploration of 11 funeral rites. Students learned that in Ghana, caskets are woven in the shape of objects beloved by the deceased; in South Korea, a person\u2019s remains may be pressed into jewelry; and in Tibet, the mountaintop \u201csky burial\u201d in the open allows a dead person\u2019s soul to exit the body and be reincarnated. \u201cI asked them to choose five rituals that would be a good fit with their values and cultures,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI wanted them to make connections, to see how other cultures see life and death.\u201d\n\u201cEvery class that I\u2019ve revised to include international representation,\u201d she added. \u201cI found that the students made more connections because they had a cultural anchor. And when I assessed what they retained I got content-specific vocabulary because it stuck, especially where they could see aspects of themselves and of people they knew. And the questions I got were better. I stopped getting \u2018what\u2019 questions and started getting \u2018why\u2019 questions, and \u2018what if\u2019 questions.\u201d\nAt Mill Valley Middle School in California, two teachers, Rod Septka and Maggie Front, working with more affluent students, have seen this approach evoke a similar response. When the recent drought in California was daily news, they looked at how people in the state were conserving water. Then they examined how people cope with water-related problems in Bangladesh, Israel, Sudan, Bolivia, China, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Peru and Syria. The students did extensive research and data gathering. One student was astonished that so many people around the world couldn\u2019t just go into their kitchen and get water from a tap. Then the water crisis in Flint, Mich., became news, and they looked at water access in terms of wealth and race. That led a student who had been previously disengaged in school to discover her activist voice, said Front. And studying water rights brought her to a related concern: women\u2019s rights.\n\u201cA lot of this helps the kids to understand what actions they can take toward solving world issues,\u201d said Front. \u201cIt\u2019s not the mission to create activism, but that tends to come out of it.\u201d\nIn a culminating experience, the students, working in twos, carried five-gallon buckets of water for half a mile. They experimented with ways to do it efficiently, while minimizing spillage, and collected data about time, distance and volume to calculate how long it would take them to provide water for their family. \u201cIt was a lot harder than they thought,\u201d said Septka. \u201cIt gave them a newfound appreciation for people who have to do things differently than we do.\u201d\nEach of these teachers described learning alongside the students, making mistakes, and improving their own global competence in the process.\nFor now, teacher education that is focused on this area remains at a nascent stage, says William Gaudelli, an associate professor at Teachers College at Columbia University who is a founder of the college\u2019s Global Competence Certificate program and the author of a book titled \u201cGlobal Citizenship Education: Everyday Transcendence.\u201d\n\u201cBy and large, our curriculum in the United States is a European great civilization approach \u2014 Plato to NATO \u2014 with some add-ons for cultural diversity,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the condition we live in is fundamentally global. There\u2019s literally nothing that\u2019s not connected far beyond our borders. When people 100 years look back on our generation, they\u2019re going to wonder: How did they know so much about what was going on and do so little to educate about it?\u201d\nFor Mortenson, a core hurdle is moving beyond the \u201caversion to complexity in our education system.\u201d\n\u201cThe system was set up that way because the idea was to standardize knowledge,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was appropriate when someone was being trained for a job they might hold for 40 or 50 years. But the world has changed in such profound ways that developing an understanding of complexity is paramount. Whatever the policy, the idea that things are simple, or black and white, and we can put a blanket on them and feel that it\u2019s going to have the desired impact \u2014 that idea can become very dangerous.\u201d\n*Answers, with percentage of respondents who gave the correct answer.\n1. d (29 percent)\n2. b (49 percent)\n3. a (10 percent)\n4. a (12 percent)\n5. a (47 percent), c (28 percent), g (34 percent), h (14 percent)\n6.

Here\u2019s the sign-up.)\nGood morning.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\n\u2022 Europe closed what may be its most shameful chapter of bloodletting since World War II.\nAfter a trial that lasted years, the Bosnian Serb warlord Ratko Mladic, 75, was sentenced to life in prison by a U.N. tribunal. He was convicted of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity in the slaughter of Bosnian Muslims during the breakup of Yugoslavia. Above, celebrating the sentence in Srebrenica, where 8,000 men and boys were executed by Mr. Mladic\u2019s forces.\nOur reporters note that European nationalist passions are once again on the rise.\nIn an Op-Ed, a journalist who covered the Bosnian war says Mr. Mladic\u2019s conviction was too long in coming and sends a discouraging message to victims of conflicts in Syria, Zimbabwe, Yemen and elsewhere: \u201cWill Mr. Mladic\u2019s verdict, 22 years in the making, inspire hope that justice can be delivered fairly and without delay? I think not.\u201d\n_____\n\u2022 The U.N. Command is demanding to meet with officials of the North Korean People\u2019s Army, accusing its troops of violating the truce that halted the Korean War when they fired on and chased a defecting comrade across the border last week. South Korean cameras recorded the escape.\nAnd North Korea called the Trump administration\u2019s imposition of new punishments \u2014 restoring the North to the U.S. list of terrorism sponsors and yet more sanctions \u2014 a \u201cserious provocation.\u201d\nIn the U.S., the death of an American who had been held in harsh conditions by the North in 2010 raised concerns that he had committed suicide.\n_____\n\u2022 Security forces in Papua New Guinea stormed a controversial detention center on Manus Island, in an attempt to end a standoff that has drawn international scrutiny to Australia\u2019s refugee policy.\nThe authorities destroyed belongings in the men\u2019s shelters and announced that the men had to leave for alternative facilities on the island. The camp was officially closed on Oct. 31, with electricity, food and water being cut off as hundreds of asylum seekers refused to leave.\nLeft, a photo taken by a refugee on Manus Island and released by an Australian activist group.\nThe Times recently sent journalists to visit the Manus Island camp as well as the new facilities the men are supposed to move to. Damien Cave, our Australia bureau chief, shared more photos and stories from that trip.\n_____\n\u2022 The Trump administration formally declared that Myanmar\u2019s brutal crackdown on its Rohingya Muslim minority constituted \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson said the designation was made \u201cafter careful and thorough analysis of the facts.\u201d The move opens the door to sanctions against the country\u2019s military and intensifies pressure on Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, its embattled civilian leader.\nThe Rohingya crisis will come under additional scrutiny next week, when Pope Francis visits Myanmar and Bangladesh.\n_____\n\u2022 Affordable housing featured prominently in Britain\u2019s annual budget presentation.

    "text": "Playing for \u2018Our Own,\u2019 Afghanistan\u2019s Cricket Stars Return Home as Heroes\n2017-05-09T13:30:19.000Z\nKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Some of the children walked for two hours. Others paid about 30 cents for the bus ride. Some left home in their faded blue uniforms, backpacks and all, but skipped school rather than risk missing anything.\nNow they are here, at the Kabul International Cricket Ground, among a crowd of roughly 300 who are watching the final of a local league, with a $15,000 prize up for grabs. It is 75 degrees in the intense sun of early afternoon.\nMost of the older people in the crowd sit in the stands, in the shade of pop-up marquees. But not these children. They are pressed against the blue railing, their eyes intent above its spearlike tips, and just below the razor wire that is supposed to prevent anyone from entering the field.\nThey are not just cricket fans \u2014 they are fanatics, commentator-mimics, encyclopedias of often-imagined trivia about their favorite players. And just curious, demanding children. For hours, they remain intent on every play, almost immediately returning to the railing each time they are chased up the stands by a Taser-carrying guard.\nMany of the players in front of them are stars: celebrities propelled by the game from villages and dusty refugee camps to the highest national, and even international, stage. So when the fans demand, they oblige. This is the love they play for.\n\u201cHey Shafaq, sign this, will you?\u201d shouts one boy, sticking his cap through the railing at Shafiqullah Shafaq, a member of the country\u2019s national team who is fielding at the boundary now for one local side. Mr. Shafaq steps over the boundary rope and signs cap after cap on his raised knee.\nAs the play resumes, he drops the pen and runs after the ball.\n\u201cShafaq, any chance for a photo?\u201d Calls another young fan.\n\u201cAfter this ball,\u201d Mr. Shafaq says. Phone after phone is handed to him as he extends his arm, smiles, takes selfies with the children behind the railing, and then hands the phones back.\n\u201cPlaying in our own nation, for our own people, it gives me happiness,\u201d Mr. Shafaq said after the game, which his team lost by a small margin.\nCricket has had a remarkable rise in Afghanistan, after its first team was born, more than a decade ago, by players returning home from the dusty parks of a refugee camp in Pakistan. Now Afghanistan\u2019s team consistently ranks in the world\u2019s top 10.\n\u201cA very long journey, in a very short time,\u201d said Shukrullah Atif Mashal, chairman of the Afghanistan Cricket Board. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great example, for all institutions in Afghanistan.\u201d\nIn the documentary \u201cOut of the Ashes,\u201d which beautifully captures the Afghan cricket team\u2019s rise, one player recites a couplet that describes the team\u2019s philosophy \u2014 and the escape that this unlikely game continues to bring to a weary and traumatized nation:\nPull up your sleeves and dance\nThe happiness of the poor comes only now and then.\nAfter every victory, every step up in the rankings, the team is, in fact, welcomed home with song and dance. Fans and officials wait at the stadium with flowers and music. The players are driven around Kabul in the backs of trucks, trophy in hand, smiles beaming.\nThe players\u2019 faces are all over billboards and commercials. Television channels carry their games live; radio stations compete for the commentary. In the small province of Khost, four local television channels and eight of the 10 local radio channels broadcast games live, sometimes even local provincial games.\nThere is tremendous money in the game. The International Cricket Council, the sport\u2019s organizing body, gives Afghanistan about $1.4 million a year, around 33 percent of the game\u2019s overall budget, Mr. Mashal said. The rest comes from private sponsors, their willing numbers increasing with the game\u2019s popularity.\nLike almost everything else in Afghanistan, the game is not untouched by accusations of ethnic bias and cozying to certain political groups. But Mr. Mashal, the chairman, says he is committed to equal development of the game across the country.\nThese days, a top national team player could make as much as $10,000 a month, with everything from salary to match fees included, according to Mr. Mashal. That is a large sum in a country where a police officer\u2019s monthly salary is about $200. Then there are private leagues for bonus income. A player like Mr. Shafaq, for example, is paid about $1,000 for a week\u2019s play in a private tournament like this one. Other leagues offer as much as $500 a match.\nSome top Afghan players also play for the game\u2019s largest international leagues, in Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Caribbean. The talk these days is about two players who were given contracts in the lucrative Indian Premier League, the highest private stage for the game. The Afghan teenage star Rashid Khan got a whopping $600,000 contract, and a veteran, Mohammed Nabi, received $46,000 \u2014 all for about six weeks\u2019 play.\nIn the evenings, televised Indian Premier League games are a big show in town.\nAt his small fast-food and sweets shop in the Macroyan neighborhood of Kabul, Sediqullah Khan is glued to his 32-inch Samsung television. He usually closes shop by 9 p.m., but on a recent Wednesday night he was waiting for the game to finish.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what the Indian Premier League was before this, but now I watch because Nabi and Rashid are playing \u2014 I have not missed a single game,\u201d Mr. Khan said. \u201cI have a TV at home also, but it\u2019s not this big and I can\u2019t watch in this good quality.\u201d\nAt the cricket ground, with snow-covered mountain peaks hovering in the distance, the curious children behind the railing are busy with all sorts of subjects, including last night\u2019s Indian Premier League game in which Mr. Khan, the young Afghan star, was playing.\n\u201cWho won last night?\u201d Bismillah, 13, asks. He fell asleep after the game was interrupted by rain.\nBefore he has even heard the answer, he sees Mohammed Ibrahim, one of the players on the field in front of him, gulping from a water bottle during a fielding break.\nBismillah asks his friend next to him the player\u2019s name, and then shouts after him: \u201cHey, Ibrahim, can you give me some of that water?\u201d\nMr. Ibrahim, tall and athletic, steps over the rope to hand him the bottle through the railing.\n\u201cToss it back here after you drink \u2014 this is the only bottle I have,\u201d Mr. Ibrahim says.\nThe bottle makes the rounds. The children drink from it one after another. It doesn\u2019t make it back to Mr. Ibrahim on the field.\nHis sun-beaten lips moist now, Bismillah puffs his chest and begins a commentary on the game in front of him as if he were on the radio: \u201cWhat a glorious shot! The ball is running toward the boundary!\u201d\n\u201cThey should just give me a list of the player names and a loudspeaker,\u201d Bismillah says, satisfied with his own performance. \u201cBut they won\u2019t.\u201d\nNext to him, Rahatullah, 11, is busy with different ways of calculating what the $600,000 Mr. Khan is being paid in India means.\n\u201cEvery ball that he pitches is one lakh rupees,\u201d roughly $1,500, Rahatullah calculates.\nDuring the innings break, the renowned national team player Mohammed Shahzad walks out of the V.I.P. room in jeans and sandals. He has recently been suspended from the game for a short while by the international council for using a prohibited substance.\nThe children have decided he is going to jail.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a regular jail,\u201d Bismillah says. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice room, and it has a television, too.\u201d",

    "text": "Marty Chavez Muses on Rocky Times and the Road Ahead\n2017-11-14T07:00:01.346Z\nMarty Chavez remembers when he went to his sister\u2019s home in San Francisco for Thanksgiving seven years ago and quickly wondered whether he shouldn\u2019t have.\nThat was a time when having Bubonic plague seemed preferable to being a partner at Goldman Sachs.\n\u201cIt was almost Manichaean,\u201d said Mr. Chavez, who has been a Goldman partner since 2005 and its chief financial officer since April. \u201cTechnology in San Francisco, good. Finance in New York, evil.\u201d\nThe year 2010 had been a rough one at Goldman. Its executives had been humiliated during an all-day hearing in Washington before the Senate\u2019s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The Securities and Exchange Commission had charged Goldman with civil fraud as a result of its role in creating Abacus, a synthetic mortgage-backed security that lost some sophisticated investors more than a billion dollars. (Of course, it\u2019s worth noting the deal made John Paulson, the hedge fund manager, around a billion dollars, too, because he had the other side of the trade.)\nTo settle with the S.E.C., Goldman paid a $550 million fine, then the largest by a Wall Street firm. What\u2019s more, Congress had passed, and President Obama had signed, a new law \u2013 known as Dodd-Frank \u2013 that regulated Wall Street back to the Stone Age.\nIt was no fun being a Wall Street investment banker, let alone a partner at Goldman, which Matt Taibbi, at Rolling Stone, had famously branded a \u201cgreat vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money.\u201d\nBy the time Mr. Chavez arrived in San Francisco for Thanksgiving, the anger directed at Wall Street from Main Street was palpable. During the dinner, he recounted to me recently, one guest turned to him and apropos of nothing said, \u201cMarty, how can you work for that company? How do you look at yourself in the mirror?\u201d\nMr. Chavez thought the comment was a \u201cwildly inappropriate topic for Thanksgiving\u201d and asked, \u201cWhat exactly do you mean?\u201d The dinner guest said, \u201cWell, Lehman,\u201d referring to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. \u201cYes, what about Lehman?\u201d Mr. Chavez replied. \u201cI don\u2019t work at Lehman.\u201d\nThe conversation sort of fizzled out when the man could not articulate what exactly he hated about Goldman Sachs.\n\u201cI took away from that, \u2018Oh, it was just in the zeitgeist at the time,\u2019\u201d Mr. Chavez said. \u201cI thought, when times are rough there seems to be a human tendency \u2014 I\u2019m sure you read \u201cThe Scarlet Letter\u201d as a kid, right? \u2014 that if we find someone to name and shame and blame then we\u2019re good. And I think bankers have throughout history been useful in that context. This is not the first time, and I remember thinking, \u2018This too shall pass.\u2019\u201d\nHe was right. What a difference seven years makes. Now when he goes to San Francisco, \u201cnobody\u2019s too interested in Goldman Sachs,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re much more interested in the Russian hacking of the election and all their other\u201d \u2014 and here he searches for the right word \u2014 \u201cmishegas. So times change.\u201d\nJust as he once told people he went to school in Boston, instead of telling them he went to Harvard, he used to tell people he worked in finance, instead of at Goldman Sachs. \u201cI don\u2019t do that anymore,\u201d he said. He said he\u2019s actually looking forward to Thanksgiving this year. \u201cWell, I won\u2019t be the center of attention,\u201d he said.\nMr. Chavez is about as far from the stereotypical Wall Street senior executive as you can imagine, and that is one reason his musings about the future direction of Wall Street are listened to carefully.\nHe grew up in Albuquerque, one of five children, who all went to Harvard. He got a doctorate in medical information sciences from Stanford University. (At that time, he was known by his full name Ramon Martin Chavez.)\nIn 1990, Mr. Chavez came out, the day after he defended his doctoral dissertation. \u2013 \u201cArchitectures and Approximation Algorithms for Probabilistic Expert Systems.\u201d He is one of the few openly gay executives on Wall Street. He and his husband have a son courtesy of a surrogate in California. He has large Japanese language tattoos on his arms and for years had the type of un-Goldman-like beard favored by some Major League Baseball players in the postseason.\nHe stands all day at his specially designed desk \u2013 it goes up and down at the push of a button \u2013 in his 41st-floor office that has a stunning view of New York Harbor. His energy is kinetic; he speaks quickly and passionately, moving rapidly from one arcane topic to another, such as the efficacy of judging Wall Street firms on their return on equity, a measurement of investment banking performance long favored by industry research analysts.\n\u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s great about return on equity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt includes the notion of profit, which I think is really important.\u201d\nHe views his job as a simple one that is hard to get right: \u201cI\u2019m not paid or evaluated on the accuracy of my crystal-ball predictions,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m paid to enumerate every possible outcome and do something about every possible outcome well in advance, when it\u2019s still possible to do something, because once it\u2019s happened it\u2019s too late.\u201d\nUnlike many of his peers on Wall Street, Mr. Chavez does not complain about the extent of the regulation that hit the financial industry as a result of Dodd-Frank. Generally speaking, he says, the regulations have helped banks \u201cconfront their problems and capitalize and bolster their liquidity,\u201d making them \u201cstronger as a result,\u201d and the financial system safer and more profitable.\nThat does not mean he would not like to see some revisions on the margins. \u201cOne could ask questions all day about, well, when all these rules were enacted, did we end up with something that we didn\u2019t really desire?\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, I think it\u2019s important, while asking those questions, to recognize that the rules, broadly speaking, are working. They\u2019re making the system safer and sounder, and so I sure wouldn\u2019t want anybody to throw out the baby with the bath water.\u201d\nHe\u2019s an advocate of \u201csome sculpting\u201d and \u201csome recalibrating\u201d of the existing rules, as the Treasury Department \u2014 in its three recent white papers \u2014 and regulators such as Christopher Giancarlo, the chairman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, have been hinting will occur.\nHe said he expected Randal Quarles, Wall Street\u2019s new banking regulator at the Federal Reserve, to put less emphasis on some aspects of the stress tests than did Daniel Tarullo, his predecessor.\nInstead of complaining about the extra expense and manpower required to comply with the mountain of new regulations, Mr. Chavez chooses instead to think about it differently. \u201cIf you approach the regulations as \u2018Oh, we\u2019ve got to comply,\u2019 you\u2019ll get one result,\u201d he said. He prefers thinking about the regulations as, \u201cThis makes us and the system and our clients safer and sounder, and yes it\u2019s a lot of work, but what can we learn from this work and how can we use this work in other ways to make a better result for our shareholders and our clients? Everywhere we look we\u2019re finding these opportunities and they\u2019re very much in keeping with the spirit of the times.\u201d\nLike any good senior Goldman executive, he does worry. (Lloyd Blankfein, the Goldman chief executive, once told me he spent 98 percent of his time worrying about things with a 2 percent probability.)\nHis biggest concern at the moment is the risk of \u201csingle points of failure\u201d in the vast world of cybersecurity. He worries about any individual \u201crepository of information\u201d that does not have a backup and that can \u201cbe hacked.\u201d\nHe does not even trust Goldman\u2019s own computer system; he treats it as a potential enemy.\nHe said what got him especially attuned to this risk was when a \u201cgroup of criminals\u201d last year managed to wire almost $100 million out of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York into the central bank of Bangladesh and from there into a casino in the Philippines \u201cand was never seen again.\u201d\nIt\u2019s no longer a hypothetical. \u201cIf five years ago I would have said I\u2019m really worried about someone heisting $100 million from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and wiring it to a casino in the Philippines, you would have thought that I really worry about a lot of things in a true paranoid style,\u201d he said, \u201cand then it happened.\u201d As a result, he said, Goldman has been an \u201cearly adopter\u201d of cloud services offered by a variety of third-party providers.\nWhat also makes Goldman different from its peers is the firm\u2019s love affair with engineers. At the moment, he said, engineers comprise around 30 percent of Goldman\u2019s work force of about 35,000. It\u2019s what drew him to Goldman in the first place \u2014 to work on Goldman\u2019s in-house software, \u201cSecDB,\u201d short for \u201cSecurities Database,\u201d an internal, proprietary computer system that tracks all the trades that Goldman makes and their prices, and regularly monitors the risk that the firm faces as a result.\nHe said the system generates some million and a half points of data that were used to calculate, for the first time, the firm\u2019s \u201cliquidity coverage ratio\u201d \u2014 now 128 percent \u2014 and that were shared with regulators every day. He\u2019s been busy trying to figure out how the newly generated data can be used to help him understand what the firm\u2019s liquidity will be a year from now.\nThat way, he said, in his principal role as Goldman\u2019s chief financial officer, he can perceive a problem in plenty of time to do something about it. \u201cWe\u2019re able to get much better actionable insights that make the firm a less risky business because we\u2019re able to go much further out into the future,\u201d he said.\nHe spoke optimistically about Goldman\u2019s ability to rebound from the slump this year in its Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities group and said he expected that business to perform better when interest rates start fluctuating again.\nWe\u2019ve come to the end of our 90-minute discussion \u2014 Tiffany Galvin, from the Goldman press office, was more than ready to wrap things up 45 minutes ago \u2014 and Mr. Chavez has made no mention of the firm\u2019s longstanding investment banking prowess, whether it be in advising on mergers and acquisitions or in underwriting debt and equity securities.\nHe thinks there is nothing unusual in that, and that Sidney Weinberg, the firm\u2019s senior partner in the middle of the 20th century, would not find that omission troubling.\n\u201cGiven the times, and combined with the people, the brand and the culture, which I\u2019ve been part of for a longtime, that when you put all those things together,\u201d he said, \u201cit makes me super excited about the next 20 years.\u201d",

    "text": "He Aimed to Fight in Syria. ISIS Had a Broader Plan: Southeast Asia\n2017-09-03T18:57:55.000Z\nPURWOREJO KLAMPOK, Indonesia \u2014 The quiet young Indonesian aircraft mechanic dashed out of his relatives\u2019 home in a hurry in February and disappeared. The next time his anxious family would get word of him would be three months later, on the television news.\nThe authorities announced that the man, Yoki Pratama Windyarto, 21, was one of seven Indonesians who had joined the Islamic State and gone to the Philippines to fight on the island of Mindanao.\nHis family had not even known that he had a passport.\nAnd then another shock: Weeks later, his mother, Sri Eny Windarti, received an anonymous call saying that her son had been martyred, and got a text message with a picture of him lying dead on the battlefield, a pool of blood under his head.\n\u201cWhat caused him to go there is a big question for us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have no idea what happened to him.\u201d\nMr. Windyarto was one of about 30 foreign fighters recruited by Islamic State operatives to join the battle against the Philippines government in the city of Marawi, officials say. That fight, which has raged for months, has become the most intense military campaign that the Islamic State has supported outside Syria and Iraq.\nThe militants fighting in Marawi opposed the government long before they announced loyalty to the Islamic State, known as ISIS or ISIL. But in addition to the propaganda value of linking themselves to the militant group, recent evidence suggests that they have received financing and other assistance from the Islamic State command.\nAmong those helping to recruit foreign fighters have been Indonesians who went to Syria, joined the Islamic State and rose to leadership positions, said Sidney Jones, the director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict, a research organization in Jakarta. Another who has taken a leading role in recruitment for the group is a former law lecturer from Malaysia who is part of the inner circle of militant leaders in Marawi, the authorities say.\nOnce Mr. Windyarto arrived in the Philippines, he was told to recruit his jihadi friends to come to Mindanao for a \u201cbig party\u201d in May.\n\u201cThe Marawi operations received direct funding from ISIS central and reveal a chain of command that runs from Syria through the Philippines to Indonesia and beyond,\u201d said a recent report by the institute.\nThe siege of Marawi began in May, when Philippine troops tried to arrest Isnilon Hapilon, the Islamic State leader in Southeast Asia, and stumbled upon hundreds of militants massing for an assault.\nIn Manila, Brig. Gen. Restituto Padilla, a spokesman for the Armed Forces of the Philippines, said that most of the foreign fighters had come from neighboring Indonesia and Malaysia. Fighters from Arab countries and Bangladesh are believed to be among them, he said, but their sightings are unconfirmed.\n\u201cThere have been a number of foreign fighters who made their way here under the guise of humanitarian workers,\u201d he said. \u201cSome come through the back door. It\u2019s a very porous border.\u201d\nIndonesian Islamists, in particular, have long had ties to Mindanao. In the 1990s, they received military training at a camp near Marawi. In the 2000s, Mindanao became a transit point for Indonesians returning from fighting in Afghanistan and a sanctuary for others wanted in a string of terrorist bombings in Indonesia.\n\u201cMarawi is not strange for Indonesian jihadis,\u201d said Ansyaad Mbai, the former head of Indonesia\u2019s National Counterterrorism Agency. \u201cAll Indonesian jihadis are familiar with this place.\u201d\nA leader of today\u2019s Marawi militants, Omarkhayam Maute, is married to an Indonesian, Minhati Madrais, whose father is a conservative cleric. The couple met while studying in Egypt. For a time, Mr. Maute taught his radical views at his father-in-law\u2019s Islamic school in the city of Bekasi, east of Jakarta.\nToday, the most prominent foreigner among the militants in the Philippines is Mahmud Ahmad, a Malaysian and onetime Islamic law lecturer who fled to Mindanao in 2014.\nA seized video of a strategy meeting before the battle shows him in the militants\u2019 inner circle with Mr. Hapilon, Mr. Maute and Mr. Maute\u2019s brother Abdullah, a fellow leader of the Maute Group. The former lecturer is known among the militants there as Dr. Mahmud.\n\u201cDr. Mahmud appears to be senior to anyone operating in Indonesia, meaning whatever the intergroup frictions, all recognize a chain of command within the ISIS hierarchy that they are obliged to obey by virtue of their oath,\u201d the report says.\nAmong those Mr. Mahmud helped bring to Marawi was Mr. Windyarto.\nThe young aircraft mechanic grew up in a mostly Muslim neighborhood in the central Java town of Purworejo Klampok, a tolerant community about 250 miles east of Jakarta. The family is doing well by local standards: His mother is an English teacher, his father a town official.\nA few years ago, Mr. Windyarto was accepted into a university. But his parents said the cost was too high and sent him to the Indonesia Aviation School, a strict boarding school in the city of Tangerang, west of Jakarta.\nHe began studying aviation maintenance there in 2013. At first he was despondent. His head was shaved and he was not allowed to leave or talk to anyone by phone for three months. He graduated in September of last year, shortly before his 21st birthday, and moved in with his uncle while waiting to start a job as a trainee at Garuda Indonesia, the state airline.\nMr. Windyarto had always been devout. And during his stay in Bekasi he expressed conservative religious views to some family members, including the idea that women should not work outside the home.\nBut in interviews, more than a dozen relatives said they had not realized that he had embraced a radical ideology. He never spoke about the Islamic State or Syria, they said, speculating that he had been recruited online.\nBut Ms. Jones, a leading expert on terrorism in Southeast Asia, said evidence indicated that he had been recruited by Islamists in person after he was allowed to leave campus.\nBy 2015, he had joined a little-known Islamist network called Al Hawariyun, or \u201cThe Helpers,\u201d and took part in military training outside Jakarta, according to her institute\u2019s report.\nThe network\u2019s first leader, the cleric Ustadz Nanang Ainur Rafiq, went to Syria in 2015 and was killed last year fighting Kurdish forces. The next leader, Abu Nusaibah, was arrested in November with eight followers on charges that they were plotting to set off a riot at a huge election protest against the governor of Jakarta.\nSoon after, Mr. Windyarto began making plans to go to Syria along with another member, Anggara Suprayogi, whose wife worked as a maid in Hong Kong and was part of a radical cell of domestic workers there, Ms. Jones said.\nMore than 500 Indonesians have joined the Islamic State in Syria, including families with children, Ms. Jones said. About 100 fighters have been killed in combat or by airstrikes; others have risen within the Islamic State\u2019s ranks.\nBut when the two militants contacted Indonesian operatives with the Islamic State in Syria, they were urged to go to Mindanao instead and told to contact Mr. Mahmud, the report says. He agreed to help and directed a member of a rival Islamist group in Central Java to organize their travel.\nIn mid-December, even before starting his job with Garuda, Mr. Windyarto quietly got a passport.\nMr. Windyarto was briefly ill in mid-February, and his mother went to Bekasi to care for him. Even then, she said, he gave no hint of his plan to leave.\nBut after she left, he emptied his bank account, dropped out of the family WhatsApp messaging group and sold his motorbike and laptop, she said. Then, on Feb. 27, he made a quick visit to the house in Bekasi when only his aunt was home, retrieving a flash data drive before rushing off. He never spoke with a family member again.\nOn March 20, his parents, suspecting that he might have run off to join militants, filed a missing person\u2019s report and asked the police to block him from leaving the country.\nEven so, they said they were shocked on May 31, when the Indonesian police announced on national television that their son and six other Indonesians were wanted for involvement in Islamic State terrorism in Marawi.\nThe phone call that Ms. Windarti dreaded came on June 20. A man speaking English told her that her son had become a \u201cshahid\u201d \u2014 a martyr.\nHe texted her the picture of her son\u2019s body lying on the ground.\nFamily members cling to the hope that he may somehow be alive, perhaps having faked his death to escape. But there have been few answers.\n\u201cIf we use our normal logic, it doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d said his uncle, Anto Kuswanto, in Bekasi. \u201cWe educated him to be a good guy. He had never even been in an airplane.\u201d",

    "text": "\u2018Why Do All the Jihadis Come to Birmingham?\u2019\n2017-03-27T01:16:12.000Z\nBIRMINGHAM, England \u2014 Outside the Maasha\u2019Allah internet cafe, Mohammed Hussain raised his voice over the recorded Quranic verses blaring from the abaya shop two doors down. He was furious that Britain\u2019s latest terrorist attacker had amplified his city\u2019s stigma.\n\u201cWhy do all the jihadis come to Birmingham?\u201d he half-shouted, prompting a passing group of teenage girls in bright-colored head scarves to frown, then giggle.\nExaggeration or not, many people are asking that question. Khalid Masood, 52, the Briton responsible for the deadly attack outside Parliament last week, remains a puzzle to investigators working on how, why and when he was radicalized.\nBut one aspect is familiar: He had a connection to Birmingham, having moved almost a year ago to this city of 1.1 million, where more than than one in five residents declare Islam as their religion.\nAs if to further punctuate the connection, the police announced Sunday that they had arrested an unidentified man in Birmingham as part of the investigation of Mr. Masood.\nMembers of Birmingham\u2019s Muslim communities acknowledged the linkage between their city and Islamist extremism, which many attribute to poverty and drug abuse that make youths vulnerable to jihadist recruiters who operate like gangs. But Muslims in Birmingham also deeply resent what they see as a grossly unfair reputation, countering that most residents are proud and law-abiding.\nMany also see their neighborhoods as reassuring refuges from the backlash of anti-Islam bigotry roiling Europe and elsewhere.\nThe bigotry has often focused on Birmingham. A few years ago, a Fox News terrorism commentator had to apologize for describing Birmingham as a \u201cMuslim-only city\u201d where non-Muslims \u201cdon\u2019t go.\u201d\nNonetheless, Birmingham, Britain\u2019s second-biggest city behind London, has produced a disproportionate number of convicted Islamist militants, including some linked to the Sept. 11 attacks, and to last year\u2019s bombings in Brussels.\nSo many Islamist militants have been born in Birmingham \u2014 or have passed through \u2014 that the Birmingham Mail newspaper once lamented that the city had the dubious distinction of \u201cTerror Central.\u201d\n\u201cThe extremist schools of thought seem to have become more embedded in Birmingham than in other parts of the country,\u201d said Nazir Afzal, the former chief crown prosecutor for northwest England, who is from Birmingham.\nMr. Masood, who converted to Islam in his late 30s, was born and raised in an affluent village in southeast England. He spent much of his adulthood in and around London, interrupted by jail time and two yearlong relocations to Saudi Arabia. But Birmingham was his last residence.\nBirmingham was the birthplace of Britain\u2019s first suicide bomber, the residence of a financier of the Sept. 11 attacks, and the place where Al Qaeda hatched a plot to blow up a commercial airliner in 2006. When a masked member of the Shabab, the Somali extremist group, celebrated the murder of the soldier Lee Rigby in a 2013 video, he listed Birmingham as the first source of its fighters.\nThe man who is believed to have recruited the militant known as Jihadi John, the Islamic State executioner with the King\u2019s English accent, was from Birmingham, as was his closest associate. Other prominent militants who have come through the city\u2019s underground networks include Abdelhamid Abaaoud, organizer of the 2015 Paris attacks, and Mohamed Abrini, a Belgian national who helped plot the 2016 Brussels attacks.\nIn 2014, Birmingham was at the center of a so-called Trojan Horse plot in which, it was alleged, a group of Islamist extremists had sought to infiltrate and take over two dozen state schools. A recent report by the Henry Jackson Society, a politically conservative research organization, found that one in 10 convicted Islamist militants in Britain come from five Birmingham neighborhoods.\nDavid Videcette, a former senior counterterrorism official, said that Birmingham had a better established extremist network than London \u2014 a city of seven million \u2014 which helped to explain why, in his view, many investigations lead \u201cback to Birmingham.\u201d\nPart of Birmingham\u2019s allure to prospective militants is its diverse sprawl of Muslim neighborhoods where they can blend in easily, local activists said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hiding place or a passing place to do what they want to do, and keep a low profile,\u201d said Mohammed Ashfaq, director of Kikit, a community organization that helps young people who are drawn to drugs and extremist ideology.\nIf a militant were to hide, for example, in Birmingham\u2019s Muslim neighborhood of Sparkbrook, Mr. Ashfaq said, \u201cno one looks at them twice.\u201d\nBirmingham is also much poorer than London, providing a more exploitable population for extremists, Mr. Ashfaq said, recalling how his organization dissuaded two youngsters from joining the Islamic State. Both were drug addicts.\n\u201cA lot of kids are on drugs, or from single-parent families, or who experience domestic violence,\u201d Mr. Ashfaq said.\nIn the neighborhoods of Sparkbrook, Washwood Heath and Alum Rock, where many of Birmingham\u2019s Muslims live, mosques dot the cityscape, some offering Shariah councils for family matters. After-school madrassas serve a growing demand for parents who want their children to study the Quran. Even state-funded schools often accommodate religious demands, allowing for lunchtime prayer, shortened days during Ramadan and optional head scarfs.\nTo many outsiders, the segregation is striking. But Muslim residents, particularly women, speak of their neighborhoods as safe havens from an increasingly hostile society.\n\u201cThere is safety in numbers,\u201d said Sara Begum, 20, shopping on Coventry Road, a bustling area where eateries advertise halal meat from Kashmir and Syrian cuisine. Ms. Begum, who wears a face-covering niqab, rarely leaves her neighborhood for fear of being insulted or worse. She said a friend\u2019s head scarf had been ripped away by far-right youths near Birmingham\u2019s downtown train station.\n\u201cI feel safe around here because a lot of other women dress like I do,\u201d she said. \u201cOther people look at this neighborhood, they see a lot of brown people and a lot of Muslims and they worry about security.\u201d\nWithin hours of last week\u2019s attack, Muslim women in Birmingham received text messages warning about the far-right English Defense League mobilizing, and urged them to stay inside after dark.\nSmall Heath Park, where girls in head scarves play soccer and men in Muslim garb huddle to share a picnic, feels like a different world than the city center, a 10-minute drive away.\nThere are recently arrived Somalis, third-generation Bangladeshis and European converts, like Alicia Fierens, who moved here with her Chinese husband, also a convert, six years ago because Belgium had become too anti-Muslim, she said. \u201cWe were having our first child and we didn\u2019t want him to grow up with that,\u201d she said. Birmingham is friendlier, \u201cas long as you stay in the area.\u201d\nOne problem, said Nicola Benyahia, who runs Families for Life, an independent organization that helps parents detect radicalization in their children, is the mistrust between Muslim communities and the authorities.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help when the community feels on the defensive,\u201d she said, sitting in a sparsely furnished first-floor office.\nResidents were angered and appalled when the government in 2008 secretly placed hundreds of close-circuit television cameras in predominantly Muslim neighborhoods. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like it was for our security,\u201d Ms. Benyahia said.\nBut she readily acknowledged that recruiters prey on Muslim youths. Her son Rasheed, then 19, abruptly left for Syria in May 2015 and was killed six months later, which prompted her to start her charity to help other parents avoid the same fate.\nMs. Benyahia, a Welsh convert married to an Algerian, said she believed someone in Birmingham had radicalized her son. When her daughter once asked him, Ms. Benyahia said, he recoiled and responded, \u201cDon\u2019t ruin it for anyone else.\u201d\nBirmingham\u2019s Green Lane Mosque, a red brick building with a clock tower that was formerly a public library, once had a reputation as an \u201cincubator\u201d of militants, Khalid Mahmood, a local lawmaker, said. Now the mosque seeks to counter them.\nLast week the mosque quickly condemned the attack in Westminster, saying it would \u201conly strengthen our ongoing work in exposing deviant extremist ideologies, to ensure that we safeguard vulnerable individuals susceptible to radicalization.\u201d\nMr. Videcette, the former counterterrorism official, said extremist networks are run \u201clike the mafia\u201d and include bookshops that sell extremist literature. They also organize tours and talks involving hate preachers, he said, and use some mosques to raise funds.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a business for them,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we say terrorism, people tend to think it\u2019s about religion. It\u2019s not. This is always about money.\u201d\nOne man in Britain who blurred the boundary between religion and violent extremism is Anjem Choudary, a founder of Al Muhajiroun, which is classified as a terror organization.\nMr. Choudary, who is now in prison after he was convicted last year of encouraging support for the Islamic State, had preached in Birmingham several times in recent years. His entourage would arrive in big vans on Coventry Road, an area associated with conservative Islam, preaching and distributing leaflets.\n\u201cThey turned religion into a gang-type thing, with thugs around him saying, \u2018Come join our gang,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Ashfaq, the director of Kikit. Their message, he said, was \u201cyou can be cool, you can become a gangster jihadi.\u201d",

    "text": "Motives of North Korea\u2019s Leader Baffle Americans and Allies\n2017-09-04T00:27:22.000Z\nTOKYO \u2014 What does Kim Jong-un want?\nThat remains far harder to answer than the technical questions about Mr. Kim\u2019s bombs and the reach of his missiles that have preoccupied American, Japanese and South Korean intelligence officials for years.\nAfter North Korea\u2019s underground test on Sunday, more is now known about the power of his nuclear arsenal, even if mystery remains about the veracity of the North\u2019s claim that it detonated a hydrogen bomb.\nYet six years after Mr. Kim took power and began executing those who challenged his rule \u2014 sometimes with an antiaircraft gun \u2014 there is no issue that confounds analysts more than the motives of a 33-year-old dictator whose every move seems one part canny strategy, one part self-preservation, and one part nuclear narcissism.\nThe conventional wisdom has always been that Mr. Kim, like his father and grandfather before him, is mostly motivated by a deep desire to preserve the family business \u2014 a small country that is an improbable, walled-off survivor of Cold War.\nBut inside the Trump administration, many have begun to question the long-held assumption that his nuclear buildup is essentially defensive, an effort to keep the United States and its allies from finding the right moment to try to overthrow him.\nMr. Kim\u2019s real goal may be blackmail, they argue \u2014 the sort that would be possible as soon as North Korea can put Los Angeles or Chicago or New York at risk.\nIt may be splitting the United States away from two allies \u2014 Japan and South Korea \u2014 who wonder whether the United States would really protect them, and half-expect Mr. Trump to make good on his campaign threat that he might pull American troops from the Pacific.\nOr it may be about making Mr. Kim a power broker, a man Mr. Trump and Xi Jinping \u2014 leaders of the two superpowers Mr. Kim is fixated on \u2014 must treat as an equal.\nMaybe it is about all three.\nVery few people outside of North Korea have met Mr. Kim, including his supposed protectors, the Chinese.\nDefectors periodically appear in London or Seoul, and offer insights, but few are true insiders. Documents revealed by Edward J. Snowden show that American intelligence agencies broke into the computer systems of the Reconnaissance General Bureau \u2014 the North Korean C.I.A. \u2014 but they learned more about operations than intentions.\n\u201cAnybody who tells you what North Korea wants is lying, or they\u2019re guessing,\u201d said Jon Wolfsthal, a scholar in the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and former senior director for arms control and nonproliferation in the National Security Council under President Barack Obama. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what Kim Jong-un has for breakfast, so how can we know what his real end game is? We just don\u2019t have great intelligence into his personal thinking.\u201d\nIn public statements, the country has made clear that it wants to be accepted as a full member of the international community and that it wants to develop its economy alongside its nuclear program. It has also maintained as a longtime goal the desire to reunify with South Korea \u2014 on the North\u2019s terms. Although Mr. Kim makes repeated bellicose threats against the United States and South Korea, such statements are always conditioned on the Americans or South Koreans continuing their \u201chostile policy\u2019\u2019 against the North.\nBut none of that explains the pace at which Mr. Kim \u2014 more technically savvy and more brutal than his father \u2014 has raced in the past year to develop an arsenal of nuclear weapons that can hit multiple targets in the continental United States.\n\u201cHe wants to demonstrate his ability to put a U.S. city at risk of nuclear attack,\u2019\u2019 Michael Morell, the former deputy director of the C.I.A., said on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS on Sunday. \u201cThat is where he is driving.\u2019\u2019\nHe has nearly achieved that goal.\nThe most commonly heard explanation is that Mr. Kim believes that once he can hit Los Angeles, or maybe New York and Washington, the United States would never risk doing to him what it helped do to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the now-deceased Libyan leader.\nMr. Qaddafi gave up all the elements of his nascent nuclear weapons program in 2003, in return for promises of economic integration with the West. That never fully materialized. And as soon as there was an uprising against him, the United States, European allies and some Arab states bombed him. He was found by rebel forces and executed.\nBut perhaps more than a self-preservation strategy is at work here. Mr. Kim, some of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers and outside experts believe, thinks he may be able to force the United States to withdraw sanctions and pull back its troops from South Korea, where they are a perennial irritant to Pyongyang.\nWhere analysts diverge is what he might do if the United States really did withdraw some or all of its forces, as Mr. Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, suggested that Washington consider doing. One fear is that it could use its nuclear arsenal as a shield for a military invasion of South Korea in an attempt to reunify the peninsula by force.\nThe worry, say those who fear the North is considering that option, is that its ability to strike the United States with nuclear missiles could undermine Americans\u2019 ability to guarantee that it would protect South Korea, as well as Japan, from attack.\n\u201cIf the Americans face a choice between San Francisco and Seoul, they will choose San Francisco,\u201d said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Kookmin University in Seoul.\nBased on that calculation, Mr. Lankov said, North Korea \u201ccan provoke a conflict in South Korea and then they can just basically put an ultimatum to the United States telling the Americans that if they get involved, they are going to basically get a North Korean retaliation strike.\u201d\nSuch a conflict would be catastrophic for Asia, and could lead to the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives. But it would also undercut every assurance the United States has made to other allies, from NATO to New Zealand, about coming to their defense.\nThe probability that the North intends to use force to reunify the peninsula, Mr. Lankov said, is \u201clow, but real.\u201d\nIt is also one of the regime\u2019s stated goals, though one that \u2014 in the absence of nuclear weapons \u2014 it has never had a realistic hope of achieving. Many believe it is a fantasy, with or without a nuclear arsenal.\n\u201cNorth Korea does not have the power to carry out an all-out war that could last a long time for unification by force,\u201d said Cho Han-bum, a senior researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification, a South Korean government-funded think tank. \u201cThere is no way North Korea, while suffering from food shortages, can liberate South Koreans by force.\u201d\nMr. Kim, Mr. Cho said, \u201chas no intention of putting his words into action.\u201d\nHe may well be right, but given the miserable track record of anticipating Mr. Kim\u2019s intentions, neither American nor South Korean leaders seem eager to make that assumption. (One senior Trump administration official noted that in 1950, everyone assumed the North was too weak to invade the South, and were wrong.)\n\u201cIt is important to take Pyongyang\u2019s threat seriously,\u201d said Mo Jongryn, dean of the graduate school of international studies at Yonsei University in Seoul.\nThere is another, less dramatic interpretation of Mr. Kim\u2019s intentions. The combination of his developing nuclear program and his increasingly impressive cyberprogram may allow the North to effectively get away with smaller provocations without fear of military retaliation.\nMr. Kim paid very little price for the cyberattack that took out 70 percent of Sony Pictures Entertainment\u2019s computer systems three years ago. There was no retaliation for its attacks on South Korean banks and media companies; its suspected theft of money from the Bangladesh central bank; or its role in a recent attack that hit Britain\u2019s hospitals with ransomware demands. It might try to expand its cyberattacks for profit, or blackmail countries for economic aid.\nAnother possibility is that the regime will use its nuclear weapons to gain the upper hand in any future negotiations with the United States and its allies.\nIn the past, negotiators assumed North Korea might be prepared to trade away its nuclear program in exchange for economic support or a peace treaty with the United States, which would mean a final settlement of the seven-decade old conflict on the peninsula. (Under the United Nations armistice that suspended the Korean War in 1953, North Korea is still technically at war with South Korea, and its allies.)\nBut now the hope that sanctions will lead North Korea to give up an arsenal in which it has invested so heavily seems almost a fantasy. Instead, there is talk of whether, as an interim step, Mr. Kim might consider a freeze of its programs at their current level.\nIf so, the huge buildup of the past few years may have an easy explanation: Before negotiating a freeze, Mr. Kim may want a nuclear capability too big to dismantle. In short, he wants to be treated like Pakistan, or India, which have made clear they will never trade away their nuclear arsenals. By and large, the world has stopped demanding that they do so.\nDomestic politics are also at work. Keeping nuclear weapons is also how the Kim regime can best engender fear and loyalty in the country\u2019s populace.\n\u201cIn order to justify what they\u2019ve been doing all these years, they need an enemy of the United States to continue to exist,\u201d said Suzanne DiMaggio, a director and senior fellow at the New America research group who has been involved in unofficial talks with North Korea. \u201cOnce that enemy is gone, then they don\u2019t have the rationale any longer to keep this society in complete isolation.\u201d\nThat is not to say that the North Koreans don\u2019t have a list of wants if and when they are offered a seat at the negotiating table.\nThe North has repeatedly called for the suspension of annual war games conducted by the United States and South Korea and an eventual withdrawal of American troops from the peninsula. It is likely to want a guarantee that the United States will never again station tactical nuclear weapons in South Korea. It will surely want sanctions lifted, and some economic aid, as well as diplomatic recognition.\nCritics of past negotiations with North Korea say it will never be satisfied. \u201cIt\u2019s just this endless slippery slope of demands,\u201d said Bruce Klingner, a Korean and Japanese specialist at the Heritage Foundation in Washington.\nSome analysts say that what North Korea most wants is respect.\n\u201cThere is a certain universality of wanting to be recognized and respected,\u201d said Cameron Munter, former United States ambassador to Pakistan and now president of the EastWest Institute. \u201cAnd because Americans take this for granted, they don\u2019t see just how deeply motivating that search for respect can be.\u201d\nBut granting that wish can be difficult for politicians who do not want to appear to be bowing to a dictator. The farthest President Trump went recently was to say at a rally in Phoenix last month that he respected the fact that Kim Jong-un \u201cis starting to respect us.\u201d\nIf that was ever true, it didn\u2019t last long.",

    "text": "In Undiscovered Paterson, Falls, Food and Fetty Wap\n2017-09-14T09:00:27.000Z\nThis Is Just to Say\u2026\nYou Should Visit Paterson, NJ\nReally.\n\u201cpaterson is not a task like milton going down to hell, it\u2019s a flower to the mind\u201d \u2013 Allen Ginsberg in a letter to William Carlos Williams\nFor a kid growing up in Jersey City, nearby Paterson, N.J., was the country.\nWhen I was a teenager, my friends and I would drive to Lambert Castle in my boyfriend\u2019s Ford and hike around wooded Garret Mountain overlooking the city.\nAnd then there were the Great Falls.\nStanding over them and feeling their spray on my face, their thunder drowning out our laughter, and eyeing that drop into the abyss was as close to heaven and hell as I\u2019d ever come. People from Jersey City weren\u2019t used to such displays of natural power and beauty. The most amazing part was that these massive waterfalls were in the middle of an industrial city, just a few towns away from my own industrial city.\nFrom above, higher than the spires, higher\neven than the office towers\u2026\nthe river comes pouring in above the city\nand crashes from the edge of the gorge\nin a recoil of spray and rainbow mists \u2014\nBack then I hadn\u2019t yet read those lines in the epic poem \u201cPaterson\u201d by William Carlos Williams, the pediatrician-poet who lived a short drive away and made house calls in the city. I didn\u2019t know Paterson\u2019s sweeping history, didn\u2019t know it was founded by Alexander Hamilton because of the falls. I didn\u2019t realize that Philippe Petit had, just a few weeks after walking between the Twin Towers in 1974, stretched his high wire above Paterson\u2019s swirling chasm and made his way across, as 30,000 people looked on, gasping. I had only just discovered the howling of Paterson\u2019s native son, the poet Allen Ginsberg, and was about to read Jack Kerouac\u2019s \u201cOn the Road,\u201d whose main character, Sal Paradise, lives for a time with his aunt in Paterson. And who could have predicted that the director Jim Jarmusch would write his own indie-film love poem to the falls, the city and to poetry itself, released earlier this year?\nBut the primeval roar of Paterson\u2019s waters told me that something special resided here -\u2013 some magnet that had drawn me and thousands of others to it, a psychic force bigger than my own teenage psyche.\nI forgot about the city as I traveled the rest of the wide world. I cheated on Paterson with a visit to Niagara, a drive across the country, then moved on to other countries and continents. But when I had my own kids, always on the lookout for fun day trips, I brought them to Paterson to see what I had seen.\nThere they were, the falls, right where I had left them, quite a spectacle for the eyes of a 7- and 4-year-old. And a 41-year-old.\nStrange to have moved\nthru Paterson, and the West, and Europe and here again\u2026fire escapes\nold as you\nThat\u2019s when I stumbled upon some of Paterson\u2019s other precious gems: Libby\u2019s Lunch, a Texas-wiener-style hot dog shack right across from the falls. Libby\u2019s, supposedly there since 1936, may be older than anyone remembers. While doing work in the basement recently, the owner\u2019s son came across paper delivery bags stamped with the Libby\u2019s name and the year, 1916.\nAround the corner was Paterson\u2019s jewel of a museum \u2013 located in the restored Thomas Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works shop \u2013 tracing the city\u2019s industrial history; big black locomotives were parked out front and Wright Aeronautical Company airplane parts sat inside \u2014 a thrill for my small son. Now that he\u2019s at college, I take my two-year-old nephew to see the antique fire trucks, Lenape Indian statues and locomotives.\nThe motor of Lindbergh\u2019s Spirit of St. Louis was made in Paterson, as were the sails for the first America\u2019s Cup yacht race. Because it was such an industrial center and important union town, Paterson was a regular campaign stop for presidential candidates: everyone from Dwight Eisenhower to Ronald Reagan. Even Bill Clinton stopped in to campaign for Hillary last year.\nBut Paterson has seen the worst of American history as well as its best. Boxer Rubin \u201cHurricane\u201d Carter, immortalized in the Denzel Washington film and in Bob Dylan\u2019s song, grew up on its streets and was falsely accused of a triple homicide committed in one of its local bars. Six of the 9/11 hijackers lived in an apartment in Paterson before their attacks, not far from the falls. Two of its recent mayors have been indicted.\nIt\u2019s as if Paterson has had a cameo in every chapter of American history.\nThe Lenape Indians, the first to be pulled by the power of the falls, came for the prime fishing and hunting on the Passaic River. All that\u2019s left now is a display at the Paterson Museum that includes an LED campfire, a wigwam and snarling bear skin.\nHamilton picnicked atop the falls in 1778 with George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette, feasting on cold ham, tongue, large biscuits and grog, and was inspired to build the country\u2019s first planned industrial city in 1792, harnessing the energy from its waters. Paterson\u2019s paper mills, textile mills, breweries, Colt factories and in particular silk mills \u2013 earning Paterson the nickname Silk City \u2014 employed wave after wave of poor immigrants. The Germans, Dutch and Irish were followed by Eastern Europeans and Italians (including the family of Lou Costello, who changed his Calabrian name from Cristillo. He now has his own statue at Cianci Park, not far from the falls, holding a baseball bat in a nod to his Who\u2019s on First routine).\nPaterson, the state\u2019s third largest city after Newark and my rapidly gentrifying hometown Jersey City, is now home to 147,000 people from 52 different ethnic groups, including Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Africans, Bangladeshis, Caribbean islanders, Middle Easterners and Peruvians.\nThanks to those immigrants, Paterson has some of the best restaurants in the state. One of my favorites is Griselda\u2019s, a Peruvian spot in a neighborhood dubbed Little Lima. Griselda\u2019s gets packed for lunch and serves great jalea (deep fried seafood) and chaufa (fried rice), though I haven\u2019t been brave enough to try its guinea pig stew. Across town in South Paterson \u2013 known as Little Ramallah \u2014 is Al Basha, a Palestinian/Lebanese restaurant that serves warm pita with authentic labne, kebabs and stewed lamb.\nSix years ago, the latest settlers arrived: the National Park Service. They now run tours of the falls, giving the landmark a legitimacy that it lacked before, working with the city and state on refurbishing the areas surrounding the Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park. Since Hamilton became a rock star, Hamilton-heads have been making pilgrimages to that picnic spot and his statue overlooking the falls. The gift shop at the visitors center now sells Hamilton books, banks, hand warmers and the Broadway cast album.\n\u201cThere has always been industry here,\u201d said Robert Veronelli, who runs the visitors center. \u201cBut the only industry left now is tourism.\u201d\nOn a weekday visit in spring, I was the only person on an official tour of the falls, but Mr. Veronelli said more than 300 tourists passed through on summer weekends, not just visitors from other parts of New Jersey but from as far as Texas and Arizona.\nVisitors can download a free audio tour app called Mill Mile that features poetry, rap and salsa and the voices of Lin-Manuel Miranda, Barack Obama, Junot D\u00edaz, Cory Booker and Ron Chernow, at hamiltonpartnership.org/millmile.\nWhen I was there, several people were milling about the falls on their own, including a young couple. Joshua Ortiz, who grew up next door in Clifton, had been here many times, but his friend, Shannon Klemm, never had. \u201cIt\u2019s so gorgeous,\u201d said Ms. Klemm, shaking her head and looking over the stone wall at the falls, the second largest by volume east of the Mississippi after Niagara. They had come because they were both \u201cSopranos\u201d fans. In one episode of the HBO series, hit men throw someone into the falls from the arched iron footbridge.\nMy guide, park ranger Ilyse Goldman, countered that on most sunny days you can see a rainbow from that same bridge because of the falls\u2019 spray. I have never been so lucky.\nThe latest boon to the town\u2019s tourism is the film, \u201cPaterson,\u201d by Mr. Jarmusch, which was nominated for the Palm d\u2019Or at the Cannes Film Festival last year. The movie is about a poet/bus driver named Paterson, played by Adam Driver, who is inspired by the falls. Mr. Driver quotes Mr. Williams in the film, the perfect poem about the plums in the ice box. And \u201cPaterson,\u201d Mr. Williams\u2019 epic paean to the city, is one of the dog-eared books on the character\u2019s writing desk.\nBooks will give rest sometimes against\nthe uproar of water falling\nMovie fans often stop in at the Paterson Museum to ask if the nearby bus depot is the same one used in the film. Indeed it is, answers the museum director Giacomo DiStefano, who was born and raised. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t the museum in the film?\u201d they ask. \u201cIf the Paterson character worked across the street, wouldn\u2019t he come and visit?\u201d Mr. DiStefano explains that the character doesn\u2019t really exist.\nMr. Jarmusch\u2019s movie is a draw for out-of-towners, but Paterson\u2019s most recent favorite son and homegrown poet is rapper Fetty Wap \u2014 26-year-old Willie Maxwell II, who grew up in the Fourth Ward neighborhood. Mr. Maxwell\u2019s 2014 runaway hit single \u201cTrap Queen\u201d references trap music, known for its synthesized, complicated beats and gritty lyrics that both celebrate and lament inner-city life.\nMr. Maxwell recorded a music video last year for another single, \u201cWake Up,\u201d featuring marijuana and a stripper, not unusual subject matter for a music video. But it was filmed in Paterson\u2019s Eastside High School, which Mr. Maxwell once attended. At the end of \u201cWake Up,\u201d a tattooed woman takes an apple off the teacher\u2019s desk and uses it as a pot pipe. Paterson officials were not amused and launched an investigation last year into how a stripper pole and platform made it into the school. A principal took the fall and was suspended, and the approval process for filming on school property has now been tightened.\nIf he were still alive, Paterson poet Ginsberg probably would have appreciated Mr. Maxwell\u2019s work. When he returned home to Paterson in 1966 for a poetry reading, Mr. Ginsberg told the crowd that he had just smoked pot at the falls to better appreciate their beauty. The mayor told the police to issue a warrant for his arrest. So Mr. Ginsberg didn\u2019t make a public appearance in Paterson for another 14 years.\nUnlike Mr. Ginsberg, Mr. Maxwell has remained a strong presence in his hometown, distributing turkeys at Thanksgiving and hanging out in the neighborhood.\nAnd you can\u2019t change what\u2019s understood, ayy\nAnd if it\u2019s all good it\u2019s all good, I\u2019ma rep my \u2018hood, ayy\nPaterson today is not just rough around the edges, but throughout; gang violence and drug deals are common, its smokestacks dormant, bail bond shops numerous and the banks of the Passaic dotted with tents from the homeless living where the Lenape once fished.\nOn my most recent drive there, I heard on the radio that a spotted Savannah cat someone was keeping as a pet had been set loose on the city streets. Thankfully it was caught before I got out of my car.\nThe large, spotted cat slinking past littered streets and aluminum sided homes, was like something one of the city\u2019s poets might include in a line. The wild power of nature bumping up against the industrial landscape that was once America.",

    "text": "How the Appetite for Emojis Complicates the Effort to Standardize the World\u2019s Alphabets\n2017-10-18T09:05:55.000Z\nAnshuman Pandey was intrigued. A graduate student in history at the University of Michigan, he was searching online for forgotten alphabets of South Asia when an image of a mysterious writing system popped up. In eight years of digging through British colonial archives both real and digital, he has found almost 200 alphabets across Asia that were previously undescribed in the West, but this one, which he came across in early 2011, stumped him. Its sinuous letters, connected to one another in cursive fashion and sometimes bearing dots and slashes above or below, resembled those of Arabic.\nPandey eventually identified the script as an alphabet for Rohingya, the language spoken by the stateless and persecuted Muslim people whose greatest numbers live in western Myanmar, where they\u2019ve been the victims of brutal ethnic cleansing. Pandey wasn\u2019t sure if the alphabet itself was in use anymore, until he lucked upon contemporary pictures of printed textbooks for children. That meant it wasn\u2019t a historical footnote; it was alive.\nAn email query from Pandey bounced from expert to expert until it landed with Muhammad Noor, a Rohingya activist and television host who was living in Malaysia. He told Pandey the short history of this alphabet, which was developed in the 1980s by a group of scholars that included a man named Mohammed Hanif. It spread slowly through the 1990s in handwritten, photocopied books. After 2001, thanks to two computer fonts designed by Noor, it became possible to type the script in word-processing programs. But no email, text messages or (later) tweets could be sent or received in it, no Google searches conducted in it. The Rohingya had no digital alphabet of their own through which they could connect with one another.\nBillions of people around the world no longer face this plight. Whether on computers or smartphones, they can write as they write, expressing themselves in their own linguistic culture. What makes this possible is a 26-year-old international industrial standard for text data called the Unicode standard, which prescribes the digital letters, numbers and punctuation marks of more than 100 different writing systems: Greek, Cherokee, Arabic, Latin, Devanagari \u2014 a world-spanning storehouse of languages. But the alphabet that Noor described wasn\u2019t among them, and neither are more than 100 other scripts, just over half of them historical and the rest alphabets that could still be used by as many as 400 million people today.\nNow a computational linguist and motivated by a desire to put his historical knowledge to use, Pandey knows how to get obscure alphabets into the Unicode standard. Since 2005, he has done so for 19 writing systems (and he\u2019s currently working to add another eight). With Noor\u2019s help, and some financial support from a research center at the University of California, Berkeley, he drew up the basic set of letters and defined how they combine, what rules govern punctuation and whether spaces exist between words, then submitted a proposal to the Unicode Consortium, the organization that maintains the standards for digital scripts. In 2018, seven years after Pandey\u2019s discovery, what came to be called Hanifi Rohingya will be rolled out in Unicode\u2019s 11th version. The Rohingya will be able to communicate online with one another, using their own alphabet.\nAs a practical matter, this will not have much impact for the Rohingya who are suffering in Myanmar, many of whom are illiterate and shut off from educational and technological opportunity. \u201cThe spread of this new digital system is unlikely to go to scale,\u201d Maung Zarni, a human rights activist who works on Rohingya issues, and Natalie Brinham, a Ph.D. fellow at Queen Mary University of London, told me in an email. They emphasized that the Rohingya do not have the autonomy to organize their own schools. But given the group\u2019s history of oppression, the encoding of their language carries considerable symbolic weight because it legitimizes an oppressed minority and their language. \u201cIt becomes a tool of unity to help people come together,\u201d Noor says.\nCreating such interconnectedness and expanding the linguistic powers of technology users around the world is the whole point of Unicode. If the work is slow, that\u2019s because standardizing a writing system for computers is a delicate art that relies on both engineering and diplomacy. And the time and attention of the volunteers who maintain the standard are finite. So what happens when a new system of visual communication like emoji emerges and comes under their purview? Things get even slower and the mission more complicated.\nShortly after finishing a linguistics Ph.D. at Berkeley in 1980, Ken Whistler was frustrated by the inability of mainframe computers to print the specialized phonetic symbols that linguists use. I can fix that, he thought, and he then hacked an early personal computer to do so. In 1989, on one of his first days on the job at a software start-up, his boss told him to meet with a Xerox computer scientist, Joe Becker, who had just published a manifesto on multilingual computing. \u201cThe people of the world need to be able to communicate and compute in their own native languages,\u201d Becker wrote, \u201cnot just in English.\u201d\nAt the time, computing in the United States relied on encodings like those from the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (usually known as ASCII), which assigned numerical identifiers to letters, numbers, punctuation and behaviors (like \u201cindent\u201d). The capital letter \u201cA,\u201d for instance, had an ASCII code of 065, or 01000001 in the 0s and 1s in the binary code of computers. Each textual character used by a computer needs its own unique sequence, a numerical identifier or \u201ccharacter encoding.\u201d The problem with ASCII was that it had only 256 codes to distribute and far more than 256 characters in the world needing identifiers.\nIn order to work with more writing systems than ASCII was able to handle, technology companies like Apple, Xerox, IBM, DEC, Hewlett-Packard and even Kodak created their proprietary encodings. None of them worked with the others. To complicate things further, some nations insisted as a matter of national pride on their own standards for text data. \u201cThe proliferation of character encodings was chaos,\u201d Whistler says.\nJoe Becker gathered like-minded computer scientists to bring order to the chaos, arguing that cooperation was needed among companies. The result was the Unicode Consortium, which was incorporated in 1991. He also maintained that the solution had to be international and helped broker an alliance with the International Organization for Standardization, which maintains more than 20,000 standards related to products and services, from the tensile strength of yarn to the chemical composition of toys. Such standards are meant to ensure, among other things, that things from one country can be used in the industrial processes of another. Standardized shipping containers, for instance, have made international commerce far more efficient. Standards don\u2019t become regulations; they\u2019re conventions, \u201crecipes for reality\u201d in the words of Lawrence Busch, a sociologist emeritus at Michigan State University who studies how standards arise. Unicode unified all the numerical identifiers and made sure they were reliable and up-to-date.\nAs is the case in other standards organizations, full membership in the nonprofit Unicode Consortium comes with the right to vote on changes to the standard. Membership dues are $18,000 annually; current full members include global tech giants (like Apple, Facebook and Google) and the Sultanate of Oman (which wants to see digital Arabic improved). A second membership tier includes a university, government bodies in Bangladesh and India, a typeface company and an emoji search engine. Over the years, members came and went, depending on their immediate interest in issues of standardization.\nUnicode\u2019s idealistic founders intended to bring the personal-computing revolution to everyone on the planet, regardless of language. \u201cThe people who really got the bug,\u201d Whistler says, \u201csaw themselves at an inflection point in history and their chance to make a difference.\u201d No fortunes have been made through Unicode, unless you count the platforms (like Twitter) and products (like the iPhone) that adopted the standard.\nUnicode\u2019s history is full of attacks by governments, activists and eccentrics. In the early 1990s, the Chinese government objected to the encoding of Tibetan. About five years ago, Hungarian nationalists tried to sabotage the encoding for Old Hungarian because they wanted it to be called \u201cSzekley-Hungarian Rovas\u201d instead. An encoding for an alphabet used to write Nepal Bhasa and Sanskrit was delayed a few years ago by ethnonationalists who mistrusted the proposal because they objected to the author\u2019s surname. Over and over, the Unicode Consortium has protected its standard from such political attacks.\nThe standard\u2019s effectiveness helped. \u201cIf standards work, they\u2019re invisible and can be ignored by the public,\u201d Busch says. Twenty years after its first version, Unicode had become the default text-data standard, adopted by device manufacturers and software companies all over the world. Each version of the standard ushered more users into a seamless digital world of text. \u201cWe used to ask ourselves, \u2018How many years do you think the consortium will need to be in place before we can publish the last version?\u2019\u2009\u201d Whistler recalls. The end was finally in sight \u2014 at one point the consortium had barely more than 50 writing systems to add.\nAll that changed in October 2010, when that year\u2019s version of the Unicode standard included its first set of emojis.\nOn a downtown San Francisco street last November, partygoers were lined up at a Taco Bell truck to get tacos. Inside the nearby co-working space, Covo, was the opening night party of Emojicon, a weekend-long celebration of all things emoji, held just days before the presidential election. Only foods that could be depicted with emojis were being served, while a balloon artist twisted approximations of various emojis.\nIn the late 1990s, when Japanese phone manufacturers first put emojis on their devices as marketing gimmicks, messaging standards required that emojis be sent as text data \u2014 as characters matched to strings of numbers, not as images. But emojis were unreadable on devices that couldn\u2019t translate their numerical identifiers.\nWhen a software engineer named Graham Asher suggested in 2000 that Unicode take responsibility for emojis, the consortium demurred on the grounds that pictures were subjectively interpreted. A few years later, companies like Apple and Microsoft realized that the increasingly popular Japanese emojis would appear as gibberish on their products and pushed the consortium to encode them. By 2009, 974 emojis had been assigned numerical identifiers, which were released the following year.\nAs the demand for new emojis surged, so, too, did the criticisms. White human figures didn\u2019t reflect the diversity of real skin colors. Many emojis for specific professions (like police officer and construction worker) had only male figures, while icons for foods didn\u2019t represent what people around the world actually ate. Millions of users wanted to communicate using the language of emoji, and as consumers, they expected change to be swift. One thing appeared to be slowing things down: the Unicode Consortium.\nAt Emojicon, resentment toward Unicode was simmering amid the emoji karaoke, emoji improv and talks on emoji linguistics. \u201cSuch a 1980s sci-fi villain name,\u201d one participant grumbled. \u201cWho put them in charge?\u201d A student from Rice University, Mark Bramhill, complained that the requirements for the yoga-pose emoji he had proposed were off-puttingly specific, almost as if they were meant to deter him. A general antiestablishment frustration seemed to be directed at the ruling organization. One speaker, Latoya Peterson, the deputy editor of digital innovation for ESPN\u2019s \u201cThe Undefeated,\u201d urged people to submit proposals to Unicode for more diverse emojis. \u201cWe are the internet!\u201d she said. \u201cIt is us!\u201d\nOn the first morning of Emojicon, Mark Davis, president of Unicode, explained in a talk that the consortium also maintains the repository for time and date formats, currency and language names and other information that adapts computer functions to where a user is. Even more demanding technically is making sure that characters behave as users want them to. One major achievement has been ironing out how right-to-left alphabets like Arabic are used in the same line of text as left-to-right ones like Latin, which affects billions of users and can take years to adjust. Dealing with emojis, in short, is a small, though increasing, part of the consortium\u2019s responsibilities.\nDavis mentioned that once characters become part of the Unicode standard, they\u2019re never removed. This inspired one young designer in the audience to announce that he\u2019d ensure his legacy by proposing emojis until one was accepted. The crowd laughed; Davis smiled coolly, perhaps because Unicode committees have been overwhelmed with some 500 submissions in the last three years.\nNot everyone thinks that Unicode should be in the emoji business at all. I met several people at Emojicon promoting apps that treat emojis like pictures, not text, and I heard an idea floated for a separate standards body for emojis run by people with nontechnical backgrounds. \u201cNormal people can have an opinion about why there isn\u2019t a cupcake emoji,\u201d said Jennifer 8. Lee, an entrepreneur and a film producer whose advocacy on behalf of a dumpling emoji inspired her to organize Emojicon. The issue isn\u2019t space \u2014 Unicode has about 800,000 unused numerical identifiers \u2014 but about whose expertise and worldview shapes the standard and prioritizes its projects.\n\u201cEmoji has had a tendency to subtract attention from the other important things the consortium needs to be working on,\u201d Ken Whistler says. He believes that Unicode was right to take responsibility for emoji, because it has the technical expertise to deal with character chaos (and has dealt with it before). But emoji is an unwanted distraction. \u201cWe can spend hours arguing for an emoji for chopsticks, and then have nobody in the room pay any attention to details for what\u2019s required for Nepal, which the people in Nepal use to write their language. That\u2019s my main concern: emoji eats the attention span both in the committee and for key people with other responsibilities.\u201d\nEmoji has nonetheless provided a boost to Unicode. Companies frequently used to implement partial versions of the standard, but the spread of emoji now forces them to adopt more complete versions of it. As a result, smartphones that can manage emoji will be more likely to have Hanifi Rohingya on them too. The stream of proposals also makes the standard seem alive, attracting new volunteers to Unicode\u2019s mission. It\u2019s not unusual for people who come to the organization through an interest in emoji to end up embracing its priorities. \u201cWorking on characters used in a small province of China, even if it\u2019s 20,000 people who are going to use it, that\u2019s a more important use of their time than deliberating over whether the hand of my yoga emoji is in the right position,\u201d Mark Bramhill told me.\nSince its creation was announced in 2015, the \u201cAdopt a Character\u201d program, through which individuals and organizations can sponsor any characters, including emojis, has raised more than $200,000. A percentage of the proceeds goes to support the Script Encoding Initiative, a research project based at Berkeley, which is headed by the linguistics researcher Deborah Anderson, who is devoted to making Unicode truly universal. One the consortium recently accepted is called Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong, devised for the Hmong language by a minister in California whose parishioners have been using it for more than 25 years. Still in the proposal stage is Tigalari, once used to write Sanskrit and other Indian languages.\nOne way to read the story of Unicode in the time of emoji is to see a privileged generation of tech consumers confronting the fact that they can\u2019t communicate in ways they want to on their devices: through emoji. They get involved in standards-making, which yields them some satisfaction but slows down the speed with which millions of others around the world get access to the most basic of online linguistic powers. \u201cThere are always winners and losers in standards,\u201d Lawrence Busch says. \u201cYou might want to say, ultimately we\u2019d like everyone to win and nobody to lose too much, but we\u2019re stuck with the fact that we have to make decisions, and when we make them, those decisions are going to be less acceptable to some than to others.\u201d",

    "text": "How North Korea Managed to Defy Years of Sanctions\n2017-05-12T13:35:28.000Z\nDANDONG, China \u2014 As the end of the fashion season approached, and the suits and dresses arrived in her company\u2019s warehouses here in the Chinese border town of Dandong, the accountant crammed about $100,000 into a backpack, then boarded a rickety train with several co-workers.\nShe asked to be identified only by her surname, Lang, given the sensitivity of their destination: North Korea.\nAfter a six-hour journey, she recalled, they arrived at a factory where hundreds of women using high-end European machines sewed clothes with \u201cMade in China\u201d labels. Her boss handed the money to the North Korean manager, all of it in American bills as required.\nDespite seven rounds of United Nations sanctions over the past 11 years, including a ban on \u201cbulk cash\u201d transfers, large avenues of trade remain open to North Korea, allowing it to earn foreign currency to sustain its economy and finance its program to build a nuclear weapon that can strike the United States.\nFraudulent labeling helps support its garment industry, which generated more than $500 million for the isolated nation last year, according to Chinese trade data.\nNorth Korea earned an additional $1.1 billion selling coal to China last year using a loophole in the ban on such exports, and researchers say tens of thousands of North Koreans who work overseas as laborers are forced to send back as much as $250 million annually. Diplomats estimate the country makes $70 million more selling rights to harvest seafood from its waters.\nChina accounts for more than 80 percent of trade with North Korea, and the Trump administration is counting on Beijing to use that leverage to pressure it into giving up its nuclear arsenal. The Chinese government took a big step in February by announcing that it was suspending imports of coal from the country through the end of the year.\nBut China has a long record of shielding North Korea from more painful sanctions, because it is afraid of a regime collapse that could send refugees streaming across the border and leave it with a more hostile neighbor.\nIn addition, Beijing now has a sympathetic ear in South Korea, whose newly elected president, Moon Jae-in, echoes its view that sanctions alone will not be enough to persuade Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear program.\nWhile North Korea remains impoverished and dependent on food aid, its economy appears to be growing, partly because of a limited embrace of market forces since its leader, Kim Jong-un, took power more than five years ago.\nForeign trade, primarily with China, has surged, too, more than doubling since 2000, though it has slipped in the past three years.\nIn theory, North Korea\u2019s greater openness to trade makes it more vulnerable to sanctions, with new potential targets and pressure points. But it also highlights the limits of an approach to sanctions \u2014 defined largely by China at the United Nations \u2014 that aims to punish North Korea\u2019s military and ruling elite while sparing its people. As trade expands, the lines have blurred.\nPositioned near the mouth of the Yalu River, Dandong is China\u2019s largest border town, and much of North Korea\u2019s trade with the world flows across its old bridges or through its deepwater port.\nMs. Lang, 33, moved here more than a decade ago to study environmental protection. She ended up like many with ambition in this city of more than three million: doing business with North Korea.\nShe wears exquisite makeup and carries a Louis Vuitton handbag, and she said her role in the garment trade was straightforward: Orders come in from Japan, Europe and other parts of China, and she gets the clothes made.\nFor those with quick deadlines or detailed specifications, she turns to Chinese factories in Dandong, where quality control is better. Yet even these factories employ North Korean laborers, she said.\nFor decades, North Korea has been accused of sending workers abroad and confiscating most of their wages, an arrangement that activists liken to slave labor. Researchers say the practice has expanded since Mr. Kim took power, with more than 50,000 workers now toiling in up to 40 countries.\nIn Dandong, the local government boasts that 10,000 North Koreans are employed in its apparel factories, working 12- to 14-hour shifts, with just two to four days off each month and a monthly wage of no more than $260.\n\u201cThey are well disciplined and easy to manage,\u201d says the website of the Dandong commerce bureau, noting that the workers have been vetted before arrival. \u201cThere is no such thing as absenteeism or interfering with management, no using illness to shun work or procrastination and losing work time.\u201d\nMs. Lang sends more-flexible orders to North Korea, where costs are lower but it is impossible to guarantee delivery dates because of power failures and a shortage of trucks.\nHer company ships fabric, buttons and zippers to factories there, she said, because the North lacks the materials, and they put \u201cMade in China\u201d labels in garments to make them easier to sell overseas. That would most likely be considered fraud and a violation of place-of-origin rules in countries that import the clothes, experts said.\nPaul Tjia, managing director of GPI Consultancy, a Dutch company that offers advice on doing business in North Korea, said that some European clients had ordered hundreds of thousands of garments and that \u201cMade in China\u201d labels could be justified by additional work put into the clothes inside China.\nBut he added: \u201cI\u2019m not a garment manufacturer. I just make the introductions.\u201d\nChina has kept North Korea\u2019s garment sector off the list of industries targeted by United Nations sanctions, arguing that punishing it would hurt ordinary people and not military programs. It has protected North Korea\u2019s seafood industry using the same argument.\nBut it is difficult to say who benefits from this trade, in part because even private enterprise in North Korea is overseen by state officials who extract taxes and bribes.\n\u201cWhether the proceeds from the textile industry support the nuclear program is an open question,\u201d said Joseph M. DeThomas, a professor at Pennsylvania State University and a former American ambassador involved in sanctions policy. \u201cMoney is fungible.\u201d\nAt least one North Korean enterprise controlled by the atomic energy bureau, the Korea Kumsan Trading Corporation, ran a garment factory that added embroidery and beading to clothing, according to a North Korean government trade website.\nAnd South Korean officials say the millions paid by Chinese companies to fish in North Korean waters go primarily to firms controlled by the North\u2019s military.\nSanctions also do not cover the organized export of labor. The United States has urged countries to eject North Korean workers, saying their remittances benefit the military, not their families. But China, Russia and other nations continue to hire them.\nAmerican sanctions against North Korea began with a near-total economic embargo adopted in 1950, at the start of the Korean War. Over the years, some sanctions were eased and others added, including after the cyberattack on Sony Pictures in 2014 that Washington attributed to the North.\nThe United Nations Security Council did not impose sanctions until July 2006, when, after a series of missile tests, it banned countries from selling material for missiles or weapons of mass destruction to North Korea.\nThe North detonated its first nuclear device months later, followed by additional tests in 2009 and 2013, and two in 2016. The Security Council tightened sanctions after each test, as well as after a satellite launch in 2013. It targeted military supplies and luxury goods, shut Pyongyang out of the international financial system and, most recently, banned a range of mineral exports.\nBut loopholes abound. Resolutions called for searches of vessels carrying cargo to North Korea but have failed to stop its use of ships sailing under foreign flags. And when the Security Council banned its top export, coal, China insisted on an exception for transactions judged to be for \u201clivelihood purposes.\u201d\nNew measures seek to limit North Korea\u2019s ability to make money through its embassies. In Berlin, for example, the authorities are closing a hostel run out of former diplomatic quarters. But the North has responded to such crackdowns by shifting business to countries with weaker enforcement.\n\u201cHow much cooperation will the international community get from Cuba, Russia, Iran or even Pakistan, Bangladesh or Laos?\u201d asked Stephan Haggard, an expert on the North Korean economy at the University of California, San Diego.\nThe United States has also urged a boycott of Air Koryo, the North Korean airline, but it still flies to China and Russia. Chinese tourism to North Korea is booming, said Cha Yong Hyok, whose company, Indprk, takes groups by train to Pyongyang and will soon use new flights from Dandong.\nThe North often circumvents banking sanctions using front companies and agents overseas, and North Koreans routinely send and receive payments using Chinese intermediaries who take a commission, despite the ban on \u201cbulk cash\u201d transfers.\n\u201cWe can and should go after these targets, but turning this into a game of financial cat-and-mouse will never achieve the level of pressure needed,\u201d said Daniel L. Glaser, a former Treasury Department official involved in sanctions enforcement.\nUltimately, he argued, that pressure will come only if China makes a strategic decision to truly squeeze the North. \u201cThough China has taken helpful steps at times,\u201d he said, \u201cit has never been willing to go all in.\u201d\nMany of China\u2019s best-known companies have done business with North Korea even as they have sought customers and investors in the United States or relied on American-made parts and materials. ZTE, the mobile phone and electronics manufacturer, for example, shipped about $15 million of goods to the North in 2015, according to Chinese customs records viewed via the global trade database company Panjiva.\nThe company agreed to pay $1.19 billion in March for violating American sanctions against Iran and North Korea, in part by sending 283 shipments of electronics with American-made components to the North. ZTE has pledged to improve oversight.\nBut many Chinese companies sell products to North Korea without such problems. The electric car and battery maker BYD, in which Warren E. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway owns a 10 percent stake, has shipped $14 million in goods to North Korea since 2012, including rubber products in January and vehicles in December, customs records show. BYD and Berkshire Hathaway didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nJust about every big Chinese appliance maker does business with North Korea, too, shipping refrigerators, air-conditioners, televisions and other electronics. The major Chinese automakers sell vehicles to the North as well.\nEven Tsingtao Brewery shows up in customs records, delivering $20,000 worth of beer in the summer of 2014.\nUnited Nations sanctions prohibit the sale of luxury goods to North Korea, but countries are generally left to define what that means. The resolutions list jewelry, luxury automobiles, sports equipment and snowmobiles but make no mention of televisions, consumer electronics or home appliances.\nIn some cases, Chinese companies with access to advanced technology are doing business with North Korea. Subsidiaries of the defense manufacturer Norinco made seven shipments, mostly of electronic and optical goods, worth a total of $1.5 million, in the second half of last year, records say. Norinco did not respond to a request for comment.\nMatthew Brazil, a security consultant and former diplomat for the United States who investigated Chinese trade controls in the 1990s, said it was often impossible to get China to follow up on leads suggesting Chinese firms were violating restrictions. \u201cThree months later, if you\u2019re lucky, the visit is scheduled, and many times, visits weren\u2019t scheduled at all,\u201d he said.\nMr. Brazil said the problem had persisted, and \u201cany level of control of American electronics has completely collapsed because this technology can be so easily shipped from China to North Korea.\u201d\nOn AliExpress, an e-commerce platform run by the Chinese internet giant Alibaba, six of the nine shipping services list North Korea as a potential destination. Alibaba declined to comment.\nThe manager of a shipping firm in Dandong who asked to be identified only by her surname, Li, because of the nature of her work said shipping a package of electronics to North Korea was straightforward \u201cas long as it doesn\u2019t have obvious labels\u201d and meets weight requirements.\nIn fact, a delivery is more likely to run into problems on the North Korean side of the border than with customs inspectors in China. \u201cThe key,\u201d she said, \u201cis to make sure everything is fine with the people on the other side.\u201d",

    "text": "How Immigration Foiled Hillary\n2017-10-05T08:28:58.000Z\nDemocrats point to a thousand reasons that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election. Here is another.\nIn political circles, it\u2019s common knowledge that in four key states President Trump unexpectedly carried counties that Democratic presidential campaign strategists had failed to recognize as crucial terrain \u2014 sparsely populated areas of Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.\nIn \u201cWhat I Got Wrong About the Election,\u201d for example, published right after Clinton lost, David Plouffe, who had managed the Obama campaign in 2008, wrote that\nTrump\u2019s margins in rural and exurban counties were off the charts. For example, in Madison County, an exurban area outside Columbus, Ohio, Mr. Romney\u2019s margin over Mr. Obama was 20.4 percentage points; Mr. Trump\u2019s margin over Mrs. Clinton was 39.8.\nPlouffe added that this \u201chappened in thousands of counties throughout the country, and it added up quickly.\u201d\nWhat Democrats missed was the profound political impact recent immigration trends were having on the more rural parts of the once homogeneous Midwest \u2014 that the region had unexpectedly become a flash point in the nation\u2019s partisan immigration wars.\nIn a Brookings essay published last month, John C. Austin, director of the Michigan Economic Center, a local think tank, writes that the region is experiencing a \u201csteady stream of immigrants from Mexico, Central America, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.\u201d\nAs a result, Austin continues,\nImmigration has become an unambiguous factor in this racially charged Midwestern landscape. While immigrant-rich states like Arizona, California, and Florida are often at the center of immigration policy discussions, the political debate about the role of immigrants burns hottest in the heartland.\nAustin went on, in an email, to provide more detail about the power of immigration to move white voters into the Trump column:\nThe \"rural\u201d voters here are some farmers, but more likely, as in the hinterlands outside Flint, Monroe, Toledo, Erie, or Janesville, Wisconsin, they are mostly white, working class blue collar workers or retirees, many, sadly, who fled their small cities to escape blacks. They are anxious about the economic prospects for their future, their aging communities (the kids have fled), making folks mad. And now all these immigrants come and are changing the society!! Just as Macomb County, where working class white voters fled Detroit in advance of blacks, now sees nearby communities like Hamtramck becoming (in their view) a Bangladeshi bazaar \u2014 and they don\u2019t like that. And they are easily fanned to blame those folks.\nIn February 2017, Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster and strategist, conducted four postelection focus groups with white voters who had cast ballots for Trump in Macomb County, Michigan, an area he has been studying since 1985. The participants were not Republicans. They were whites without college degrees who identified themselves as independents, as Democratic-leaning independents, or as Democrats who voted for Obama in 2008, 2012 or both.\n\u201cImmigration is a powerful issue for these Trump voters, representing a demand that citizens come before noncitizens, Americans before foreigners, and that we take care of home first before abroad,\u201d Greenberg wrote in his report for The Roosevelt Institute:\nThey believe that we have \"opened up our borders, they pretty much made it a free for all\" which means fewer jobs and greater demands on government services and more concerns about safety.\nGreenberg\u2019s report is replete with revealing quotes from the focus groups:\nI went and finally signed up for Medicaid, and I\u2019m standing in the damn welfare office, and I\u2019m looking around at all of these people that can\u2019t even say hello to me in English. But they\u2019re all there with appointments for their workers, which means they have the health care, they have the food stamps.... If you can come from somewhere else, why can\u2019t we all get it?\nAnd:\nMy grandson\u2019s school, I went to as a child, there are hardly any \u2014 I\u2019ll just say American families there now. It\u2019s mostly Middle Eastern and people all standing outside waiting for their kid, to pick them up at the end of the day, and nobody\u2019s speaking English. Everyone\u2019s speaking other languages, which, there\u2019s nothing wrong with other languages.\nAnd:\nYou know what, like where I\u2019m working, at Kroger, how many Spanish people I wait on. The universal language \u2014 I don\u2019t care, if you smile \u2014 hello, I don\u2019t care what country you\u2019re from, but some of these people, they act like they can\u2019t do that, even. It\u2019s like, \"You know what? You\u2019re in America.\" Get with either \u2014 you can learn to say hello, goodbye, thank you, in our language. This is America.\nThree developments are taking place in the rust belt simultaneously.\nFirst, as recently as 2000, many of the key Midwestern counties that moved from blue to red in 2016 had very few minority residents. Since then, their immigrant populations began to increase at a rapid rate well above the national average. Second, at the same time that immigrants are moving in, younger native-born residents are leaving in droves to seek employment elsewhere, while the remaining white population is aging and is often hostile to change. It is the perfect formula for cultural conflict, and Trump proved to be the perfect candidate to exploit it. Finally, these changes are taking place in a region that Austin points out is home to \u201c15 of the nation\u2019s 25 major metro areas with the sharpest black-white segregation,\u201d making it even more unreceptive to nonwhites than other sections of the country.\nOne way to understand what has been taking place recently in the Midwest is through the use of a measure called the diversity index. This index ranks geographic areas \u2014 states, counties and ZIP codes \u2014 on a scale from 0 to 100. The higher the number, the more likely that two people chosen at random will be different by race and origin. Put another way, a higher number means more diversity, a lower number, less diversity. (The diversity index for states and counties can be found here.)\nArrayed on a diversity index, Michigan with an index of 42, Wisconsin at 35, Ohio at 36, and Pennsylvania at 41, all rank in the bottom twenty \u2014 i.e., the least diverse \u2014 of the fifty states. The diversity index for the entire country is substantially higher at 63. Examples of states with very high diversity indexes include California at 79; Nevada at 73; Texas at 70; and New York at 70.\nA rapid rate of growth in the percentage of immigrants in communities that have in the past experienced little diversity is particularly explosive.\nBenjamin J. Newman, a political scientist at the University of California-Riverside, described this phenomenon in a 2013 paper:\nGrowth in local Hispanic populations triggers threat and opposition to immigration among whites residing in contexts with few initial Hispanics, but reduces threat and opposition to immigration among whites residing in contexts with large pre-existing Hispanic populations.\nIn other words, communities that are close to 100 percent white will react intensely to a modest increase in foreign-born residents, while highly diverse communities will shrug it off.\nExit poll data from 2016 shows how critical opposition to immigration in the Midwest was to Trump\u2019s victory.\nIn Michigan, for instance, exit poll data showed that those who believe immigrants to the United States \u201churt the country\u201d voted three to one for Trump. Those who said illegal immigrants should be deported voted for Trump by better than five to one. The same pattern can be seen in exit poll data from Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania, which, while not part of the Midwest geographically, resembles it politically.\nDemocratic strategists were unprepared for the depth of the upheaval that shifted the balance of power across the Rust Belt.\nTake Erie County, Pennsylvania, one of the key jurisdictions that shifted from blue to red in 2016. In 2012, the county backed Obama over Mitt Romney 57.1 to 41.2; four years later, Trump carried the county 48 to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 46.4.\nFrom 2000 to 2015, the diversity index for Erie rose from 19 to 29.3. That\u2019s a 54 percent increase, nearly double the national rate of increase, 28.6 percent.\nFor a more extreme example, take Luzerne County surrounding Wilkes-Barre, Pa. Obama beat Romney there by 51.5 to 46.7. Four years later, Trump beat Clinton by a landslide margin, 57.9 to 38.6. In 2000, Luzerne had a diversity index of 8; by 2015 the index rose to 36.6. That\u2019s a 360 percent increase over 15 years.\nThe same pattern can be seen in many of the Midwestern counties where the shift to Trump was strongest. Adams County, Wisconsin, voted for Obama over Romney by 53.9 to 45.1. Last year it backed Trump 58.9 to 37. From 2000 to 2015, the diversity index for Adams County rose from 7 to 21.3, a 204 percent increase. Macomb County, Michigan: 51.3 to 47.3 for Obama; 53.6 to 42 for Trump \u2014 its diversity index jumped from 16 in 2000 to 34.5 in 2015, a 116 percent increase.\nAt the same time, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and, to a lesser extent, Pennsylvania, have each experienced a net out-migration of native-born residents. The effect of this exodus is twofold.\nFirst, the people leaving tend to be younger and more open-minded, willing to risk moving to a faster growing section of the country. Second, those left behind tend to be older, more closed-minded and more set in their ways.\nWilliam Frey, a demographer at Brookings, emailed me:\nThese \u201cleft-behind\u201d populations tend to be older and more backward rather than future oriented \u2014 less likely to embrace the nation\u2019s new diversity and the emerging global economy. This was surely the case among 2016 voters in rural parts of swing states that helped to elect Trump as president.\nIn a June paper, \u201cCensus shows nonmetropolitan America is whiter, getting older, and losing population,\u201d Frey wrote that nationwide, nonmetropolitan communities experienced negative population growth, declining 0.4 percent with \u201ca net out-migration of 680,000 people. This contrasts with a nearly 6 percent growth rate and net in-migration for metropolitan areas.\u201d\nFrey noted how crucial many of these declining, left-behind, nonmetropolitan communities were to Trump\u2019s victory:\nIn Pennsylvania, nonmetropolitan residents comprised just 12 percent of the population and 10 percent of voters, but Trump\u2019s nonmetropolitan margin of 287,000 votes overtook Clinton\u2019s metropolitan advantage of 243,000 votes.\nRob Paral, a fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, wrote in an email that one thing that sets the Midwest apart \u201cis the tremendous loss of native-born population.\u201d As younger residents emigrate to the South and West,\nthe depopulation makes the inflow of even modest numbers of immigrants add up to more dramatic demographic change than would be otherwise felt.\nFurther compounding the rightward movement of these white voters is their animosity to nonwhites.\nIn Macomb, the bellwether Midwestern county, Austin of the Michigan Economic Center found that whites in virtually all-white communities react most strongly to demographic changes taking place in close-by neighborhoods:\nAll the recent population growth in the county \u2014 3 percent over the past six years \u2014 has come from minorities, as the white population continues to drop. New residents include a 34 percent increase in African-Americans, a 27 percent increase in Asians, and a 14 percent increase in Latinos. And migrants from abroad account for fully 60 percent of the county\u2019s recent population increase.\nLooking at the 23 small cities and towns that make up Macomb County, Austin determined that between 2012 and 2016 each one had shifted toward Republican voting, with the increase ranging from one percent to 14 percent, but that \u201cthe shift was greatest in the white enclave communities.\u201d\nThe consequences of neighborhood increases in foreign born and black residents can be seen in Austin\u2019s data.\nIn the whitest Macomb communities, averaging 3.4 percent foreign born and 4.9 percent African-American, Trump\u2019s gains over Obama were largest, 12.4 percentage points. In the more diverse Macomb communities, close to white enclaves, 8.3 percent foreign born and 9.3 percent African-American, Trump\u2019s gains were smaller, averaging 7.2 percentage points.\nIn a prescient 2010 paper, \u201cPoliticized Places: Explaining Where and When Immigrants Provoke Local Opposition,\u201d Daniel Hopkins, a professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania, described the crucial interaction of the rate of change in the level of immigration with the politicization of the immigration issue by national figures:\nWhen faced with a sudden, destabilizing change in local demographics, and when salient national rhetoric politicizes that demographic change, people\u2019s views turn anti-immigrant.\nIn an email, Hopkins elaborated on his thesis: \u201csudden influxes of immigrants generate hostility, likely because they destabilize long-time residents\u2019 sense of their communities\u2019 identity.\u201d\nLooking back on the 2016 election and the importance of the immigration issue, what stands out is the failure of the Clinton campaign to address the immigration concerns of the Obama-to-Trump voters who played such a key role in the outcome. Campaign strategists may not have been aware of the intensity with which these voters viewed the issue, or they may have decided that given their target voters, the Democratic Party was not at liberty to moderate its unwavering pro-immigration stance.\nThe immigration stance of the Clinton campaign contrasted with Obama\u2019s record. While Obama called for immigrants who were brought into this country as children to be allowed to stay, he stressed policies calling for the deportation of criminals and in fact deported more people than George W. Bush or Bill Clinton.\nThe campaign\u2019s public stance on Immigration Reform declared:\nHillary has been committed to the immigrant rights community throughout her career. As president, she will work to fix our broken immigration system and stay true to our fundamental American values: that we are a nation of immigrants, and we treat those who come to our country with dignity and respect \u2014 and that we embrace immigrants, not denigrate them.\nEight of the nine policies described in Clinton\u2019s statement are pro-immigration, and the ninth refers only peripherally to enforcement:\nEnforce immigration laws humanely. Immigration enforcement must be humane, targeted, and effective. Hillary will focus resources on detaining and deporting those individuals who pose a violent threat to public safety, and ensure refugees who seek asylum in the U.S. have a fair chance to tell their stories.\nThe Clinton campaign has come under some fire from fellow Democrats on immigration. In a June American Prospect essay, Stanley Greenberg wrote:\nThe Democrats have moved from seeking to manage and champion the nation\u2019s growing immigrant diversity to seeming to champion immigrant rights over American citizens\u2019. Instinctively and not surprisingly, the Democrats embraced the liberal values of America\u2019s dynamic and best-educated metropolitan areas, seeming not to respect the values or economic stress of older voters in small-town and rural America.\nThe contest for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination will test whether and how the explicitly liberal stance adopted by Clinton might evolve. This is a moral and political challenge for left-liberal parties throughout the Western Hemisphere. On one hand, there has been the prospect of \u201can emerging Democratic majority.\u201d In the United States, Obama won the White House twice relying on just such a majority.\nStill, Trump\u2019s 2016 victory \u2014 as well as Brexit, Marine Le Pen\u2019s episodic successes (33.9 percent of the French presidential vote last May), and the emergence of the anti-immigrant AfD in Germany last month as the third largest party in the Bundestag \u2014 all demonstrate that backlash politics continue to gain ground and remain a powerful force.\nAn issue that first came to the fore 52 years ago after passage of the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act has yet to be resolved. The task for Democrats is how to come up with a non-xenophobic, non-racist answer to this problem.",
