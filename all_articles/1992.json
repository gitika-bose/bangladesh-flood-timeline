[{"text": "DANGER OF FLOODS WORRIES ISLANDERS\n1992-05-13T05:00:00.000Z\nThe 45,000 people of the Marshall Islands, a former United States trust territory in the Pacific Ocean, will need to be rehoused or evacuated within 30 years if ocean levels rise as much as some scientists predict as a result of atmospheric warming, according to a United States study.\nThe study, paid for by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, describes the Marshall Islands as one of the \"innocent victims\" of global warming.\nSuch a rise in sea levels would also threaten other coastal areas with far larger populations, including the Nile Delta and Bangladesh.\nThe report, which is to be released next month, was circulated by environmental groups during international talks here on curbing the emission of gasses that trap warm air in the atmosphere, which in turn melts the polar ice caps, raising ocean levels.\nThese negotiations are intended to produce an agreement on stabilizing climate that government leaders to sign next month at the environmental summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro.\nIn the talks, the Marshall Islands and 34 other island states argue that fear of flooding is already deterring foreign investment. They want the industrial nations to recognize their responsibility by insuring foreign investors against inundation.\nThe study is believed to represent the first attempt to assess the effect on a specific country of the higher sea level that scientists advising the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted in 1990. The study says the findings appear valid for a number of island states and archipelagoes, mainly in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, including Maldives, Kiribati, Tuvalu and Tonga.\nThe scientists on the advisory panel said that, depending on several assumptions, ocean levels are likely to rise by a little over a foot during the next century, or perhaps by as much as three feet.\nTaking the lower assumption, the study says, the population of the 29 atolls and 5 islands of the Marshall Islands would need to be rehoused in high-rise buildings near the highest points on the archipelago by 2022.\nIf ocean levels rise by the upper estimate of three feet a century, the study concludes, the entire population would be forced to abandon the islands, \"the only realistic option."}, {"text": "Thousands of Burmese Said to Flee Drive by Army\n1992-03-05T05:00:00.000Z\nA harsh dry-season campaign by the Burmese military against an array of ethnic and religious minorities is driving thousands of refugees across international borders daily, say United Nations officials and American experts on Myanmar, formerly Burma.\nThey say the Burmese are crossing into China, Laos and Thailand as well as Bangladesh, where a steady stream of refugees has turned in the last week into a flood.\nAn unknown number of other Burmese are being confined to detention camps as the army methodically destroys border villages in an attempt to seal off the country, exiles say. People from the Karen, Shan, Kachin, Mon and Arakanese regions -- traditional ethnic homelands strung around the country's periphery -- have been affected.\nBurmese fleeing the Tenasserim Division in the extreme southeastern part of the country say crops and cattle are being destroyed by the army and villagers are forced to hike miles to centers they call concentration camps, where diseases and malnutrition are taking a toll of children and the elderly. Farther north, tens of thousands of Karens have crossed into Thailand with similar stories.\nOn Tuesday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees issued an urgent plea in Geneva saying the situation on the Burmese-Bangladesh border was turning rapidly into \"one of the world's major refugee crises.\" Between 5,000 and 7,000 people are fleeing western Myanmar daily \"with little more than the clothing on their backs,\" the refugee office in Geneva said.\nThe United Nations is airlifting tens of thousands of blankets and plastic sheets into the area.\nIn recent weeks the State Law and Order Restoration Council, the martial law administration that seized power in 1988 in Burma, which it later renamed Myanmar, has been putting intense pressure on the remote headquarters of the national Government elected in 1990, which has never been permitted to take office. The government, in internal exile in ethnic Karen territory, is camped precariously at Manerplaw, near the border with Thailand.\nThe Burmese Army has vowed to overrun the headquarters by March 27, a national holiday, but has suffered several setbacks, said Josef Silverstein, professor of political science at Rutgers University and a leading scholar on Burma, who visited the Manerplaw region in January.\nHe said four Burmese divisions confront the lightly armed Karen rebels near the confluence of the Moei and Salween Rivers.\nPaula Green, director of the Karuna Buddhist center in Leverett, Mass., who was in Manerplaw last week, said the Karen told her that the attacks by the Burmese Army \"were the worst they had seen in 43 years.\"\nBilal M. Raschid, delegate to the United Nations for the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma, the fugitive government, said in an interview today that minority rebels fear that the Burmese Army may use chemical weapons if they fail to take Manerplaw with conventional forces.\nAt the annual meeting of the the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, member nations voted on Tuesday to put Myanmar under special international scrutiny for the first time after reports of torture, forced labor and other abuses circulated at the commission."}, {"text": "Even Bleak Bangladesh Is a Haven to Muslims Fleeing the Burmese Arm\n1992-02-07T05:00:00.000Z\nBangladesh, which has endured chronic poverty and murderous cyclones, is now being lashed by a tide of tens of thousands of Muslim refugees fleeing in panic from Myanmar.\nIn the southeast corner of this crowded country, the scenes in what pass for refugee camps are chilling even to people for whom hunger and suffering are no strangers.\nThis morning, as on many recent mornings, a little skiff nosed onto the mudflats of the Naf River here, letting off another group of refugees. They have been streaming in for the last month, usually bringing nothing more than accounts of how the Burmese Army is rampaging through their home villages, intent on driving them and their kinsmen from homes they have long occupied.\nAmong the arrivals today was Noor Zahan, who clutched a 40-day-old infant while her three small children followed her closely. 'I Was Raped'\nShe struggled through the muck to firmer ground and there, looking back at the hills of her native Arakan province in what was once called Burma, she recounted what had driven her to desperate flight.\n\"My husband was taken away as a porter by the army,\" she said. \"I was raped. We came because we heard there was a refugee camp somewhere down here.\"\nHer eyes, fearful and uncertain, darted over the crowd of Bangladeshis who indifferently watched her clamber up the embankment toward the thin asphalt road. In a shallow puddle she washed her children.\nNoor Zahan, and the 30 or so others who came in the boat, are Rohingyas, Muslims who have lived in the villages and towns of Arakan for centuries. More than 45,000, and perhaps as many as 60,000, have crossed the Naf River in the last month from Arakan, the westernmost region of Myanmar and home of most of the Muslims there.\nThey are fleeing the Burmese army, which, they say, is raping and murdering, forcing men into press gangs and destroying mosques and schools, all as part of the military junta's program of making all things Burmese.\nFor Bangladesh, the sudden onslaught of refugees has provoked both a human and a political crisis. One of the poorest countries in the world, Bangladesh cannot afford to house and feed tens of thousands of utterly destitute refugees. In fact the country is still recovering from a cyclone last spring that left nearly 140,000 people dead.\nNow, thousands of the Burmese refugees are beginning to starve, in part because Bangladesh has barred relief operations by United Nations agencies and has no relief funds of its own. Bangladesh wants to solve this problem on its own and not alienate its Burmese neighbors.\nA relief group financed by Saudi Arabia and allowed to operate in a disorganized encampment is distributing food only to refugees whom it selects, and some local relief workers say the Saudi doctors are helping only those who seem the most fervently Muslim. 'This Land of Peace'\n\"This began right after the start of January 1991,\" explained Rafiqul Islam, the director of the Rohingya Muslim Welfare Association, a small group of Bangladeshis trying to provide assistance. \"Suddenly refugees started coming after the start of Operation Pyatya, a Burmese word meaning to create a peaceful land in Myanmar. The junta thinks the Rohingya can be driven out of Arakan. The junta thinks it can create this land of peace.\"\nThe Burmese Army has been waging war with minorities throughout the nation.\nNear the border with Thailand, where the largely Christian Karen have been waging a separatist rebellion for decades, Burmese troops have invaded long-held rebel sanctuaries, driving thousands into Thailand.\nIn northern Myanmar, home to the Chin people and their insurgents, the army is seeking to restore its authority. And in Arakan, where 1.2 million Rohingyas live, Burmese soldiers are building garrisons and bunkers, driving the Muslim people out.\nIndeed, the Government in Yangon, the capital, has even changed the name Arakan to Rakhine Pyay; the Rakhines are the Buddhist minority in the province.\nSix weeks ago, a Burmese army unit attacked a Bangladesh border post, killing a guard and seizing weapons as it pursued a band of Rohingya rebels. The Burmese apologized for the attack, then simply denied it had occurred.\nBut the exodus of Rohingyas from Myanmar, Bangladesh's only neighbor beside India, has created a delicate situation for the Dhaka Government.\nIn conversation, Government officials deplore Myanmar's human rights record, the refusal of the military junta to recognize the election of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, and the Government's brutal pro-Burmese campaign.\nYet the Dhaka Government publicly professes \"quiet diplomacy,\" to preserve at least civil relations between the two countries. So cautious is the Dhaka Government that it even refrained from congratulating Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi when she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Food, Please, Not Words\nOn the Myanmar border, in Teknaf and farther up the road in Moricha, where tens of thousands of refugees are gathering on patches of unoccupied land, diplomatic niceties are overshadowed by the struggle for life.\nThe hillocks of Moricha, little more than a cluster of partly deforested mounds at a bend in the thin macadam road that runs the spine of this peninsula, are now covered with shacks packed with refugees. Lean-tos of twigs, leaves and matted grass cling to the muddy paths that lace the hills like coarse netting. Everyone has a tale of horror.\n\"I came five days ago,\" said a young woman named Gulshesher, who crouched in the mouth of her fragile hut. \"Two months ago, we were sleeping and the army came and took my husband. I haven't seen him since. I don't know if my husband is alive.\n\"The military came and said, you must leave this place. I said, this is my country, why should I leave.\"\nAs she spoke, an elderly man strode up the path, a white turban on his head. A plastic badge identified him as Master Sirajul Alam Chawdhury, a relief worker for the Rohingya Muslim Welfare Association. \"I was a school teacher in Burma for 24 years,\" he said. \"I came here in 1978,\" when a Burmese pogrom against the Rohingyas drove 300,000 into exile in Bangladesh.\nUltimately, nearly two-thirds returned home. Mr. Chawdhury sought political asylum here and stayed. 'From Another Place'\n\"All of these people are Burmese Muslims who accept the Islamic religion,\" he explained. \"The Burmese Government cannot accept them. They say, you are coming from another place, you are foreigners. We say, we have been here 1,300 years. But the Burmese Government says, you come from another place.\"\nMr. Chawdhury estimated that there were 12,000 refugees living in the hills, with more arriving every day. There was no food, no clothing and barely any medicine.\nBut Rabita, a relief organization based in Mecca, was at work on the other side of the road. Unlike Mr. Chawdhury's group, which struggled simply to provide to anyone whatever sparse supplies it could find, the Saudi group is refusing rations to thousands of desperate refugees.\n\"Rabita has some interest to give rations to some people,\" said Mr. Chawdhury. \"If you arrive today as a refugee, you can get nothing. If you want to go to Rabita, you will not get it. Rabita has selected people among the refugees. They will point out and say, 'You are entitled to food.' \"\nA Rabita worker, Abdul Rashid, saidno one had been denied food. \"I am unaware of this fact,\" he said. But a Saudi doctor who followed foreign journalists only agreed to treat a very sick child when the journalists demanded that he do so. The doctor ignored a woman who was moaning faintly inside the same lean-to. \"She's not sick,\" he said matter-of-factly. \"She's just hungry.\"\nWhile large and well-armed rebel groups are battling Burmese troops in parts of Myanmar, among the Rohingyas only a small and ineffectual force of guerrillas has emerged. A leader of the group, known as Arif, met with a few foreign journalists. A former teacher, he declined to give his name because he worries that Bangladesh would send him back.\n\"We live in Burma,\" he said, sitting on the edge of a bed in a small cement room in the heart of this decrepit town. \"It's our country. We belong to it. We want to be in our country under a federation of Burma.\"\nHe spoke frankly, almost apologetically, of the limitations of his rebels, with none of the bravado of most guerrillas. \"We have around 2,000, but with poor equipment,\" he said. \"We have very few AK-47's. Mostly we have guns from the Second World War. We have some hit and run guerrilla actions. We try to organize the people.\"\nArif's presence in Arakan has done nothing to hinder the movement of the Burmese army. Over the last week, regular witnesses to the influx of refugees said, the number of Rohingyas coming across the Naf River has increased sharply. In a single hour three boats landed here, each with at least 30 people, despite a cruising Burmese patrol boat flying a red flag. -------------------- Refugees' Flight Continues\nTEKNAF, Bangladesh, Feb. 6 (AP) -- About 20 Muslim students attacked four soldiers on a patrol in western Burma, overpowered them and fled with their rifles to Bangladesh, said a Burmese who arrived here today. A businessman who was among 500 Muslims who reached here today reported the attack in the town of Saferaung, along the Naf river."}, {"text": "CONFERENCE IN RIO/The Rich Vs. the Poor; Cooling the Globe Would be Nice, But Saving Lives Now May Cost Less\n1992-05-31T05:00:00.000Z\nOne of the frustrations for planners of the Earth Summit in Rio has been the inability of the world's nations to reach agreement on an idea that seems relatively obvious: that something must be done to keep the earth from slowly getting hotter.\nDespite the possibility of floods, famines and droughts within the next 50 or 100 years -- though not all scientists are convinced that global warming is a real threat -- the pre-conference talks have already badly split on the issue. Rich nations want poor ones, with their rapid birth rates, to stop scrambling to get more factories and more cars, even if that means they will stay poorer for a while. Poor nations, by contrast, furious that the rich ones have produced far more pollution per person for the last 200 years, want the industrialized countries to be the ones to drive less, plug in less and put expensive scrubbers on their smokestacks -- and they want them to admit that it's more important for poor nations to get out of poverty than to be ecologically pristine.\nInterestingly enough, many economists, including some outspoken liberals, think the poor nations are right.\nThe World Bank's 1992 \"Development and the Environment\" report argues strongly that eliminating poverty should remain the world's top goal. It recognizes that countries will use more energy and pollute more, but argues that growth is a powerful antidote for the kinds of pollution that are killing people right now.\nNearly 2 billion people live without clean water or sewers, and cholera, typhus and other diseases kill two million children a year. One billion live in cities with unsafe sulfur dioxide levels; coal-fired factories spread lung disease and acidify cropland. Leaded gasoline fumes leave many children retarded. Topsoil depletion costs the third world up to 1.5 percent of its annual gross domestic product, and farmers starve.\nSacrificing more people by slowing progress in order to forestall deaths in 50 or 100 years makes no sense, the report concludes.\n\"Poverty is already a worse killer than any foreseeable environmental distress,\" said Lawrence H. Summers, chief economist at the World Bank, who calculates that 34 million people a year -- more than live in California -- die of poverty-related causes. \"Nobody should kid themselves that they are doing Bangladesh a favor when they worry about global warming.\"\nThese economists insist that it is cheaper and fairer for rich countries to shoulder the anti-warming effort. Any funds they spend in the third world should go for things like safe drinking water, sewers, cleaner smokestacks and engines and soil conservation. Education for girls should be another priority, some say, since studies have shown that girls in developing countries with high school educations have an average of three children, while those without average seven.\nEconomic growth increases pollution, economists admit, but they say that the pendulum eventually begins to swing back. By some estimates, once a nation's per capita income rises to about $4,000, it produces less of some pollutants per capita because it can afford technology like catalytic converters and sewage treatment. Solid waste and carbon dioxide emissions keep increasing, though. Some countries, like Mexico and Russia, are at that $4,000 threshold now.\nPoor countries can still fight global warming, the economists say. But the most sensible steps for them to take first are relatively low-cost ones that will also help their economies. For example, eliminating government subsidies on coal and oil will force factories and utilities to become more efficient. Enforcing property rights can slow deforestation. Educating girls can slow population growth. Small Results With High Prices\n\"Scientists say there are all these neat things to do for free,\" said Robert Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, an economics research group. \"If it would do so much good now, why haven't we done them? The reasons are political.\"\nIn the industrialized world, he points out, even rudimentary steps like adopting taxes on pollution have often been stymied. In the United States, measures like the gas-guzzler tax on big cars and the creation of saleable air-pollution rights have had some effect, but gasoline is still cheap, so there is little incentive to conserve.\nOn another front, the economists argue that the high price of curbing global warming will yield only small gains.\nThe World Bank cites estimates that keeping American emissions of greenhouse gases at present levels would cost between 3 and 7 percent of the G.D.P. Three percent equals Federal health spending; 7 percent equals military spending.\nThe key question is: how much sacrifice is it worth? \"You could get rid of highway fatalities if you reduced the speed limit to five miles per hour,\" said Mr. Hahn. \"How much economic growth do you want to give up to buy insurance against global warming?\" Like a Recession\nIn developing countries, the price might be twice as high, largely because they lack capital, rely heavily on cheap but dirty fuels like wood and charcoal, and have less flexibility since more energy goes for uses like cooking than for air-conditioning.\nOn the other hand, the economists argue, the costs of global warming, while large, are hardly infinite. William Cline of the Institute for International Economics and others estimate that if the United States's weather became 2 or 3 degrees hotter 50 years from now, the extra costs of adapting -- such as building seawalls and shifting crops -- would equal only 1 to 2 percent of G.D.P., the impact of a mild recession.\nIn developing countries, putting money into job-creating industries might make more sense, they argue. If every dollar invested today grows to $100 in 50 years, the higher incomes would make climate changes less painful, since people could afford safer housing, more farm irrigation and the like. \"The evidence implies that investments with real rate of return as low as 5 percent do more for future generations than investments in large reductions of greenhouse gas emissions,\" the report said.\nThe scariest prospects involve the damage to agriculture. But as many economists have pointed out, most famines in recent centuries have been caused not by food shortages but by poverty. As a whole, the world grows more food than it can eat. With higher incomes, poor countries could buy more.\nEconomists with environmental groups say these estimates are too conservative, and, more important, that they miss the point.\n\"The approach that 'We'll be 1 to 6 percent less rich' leaves out the risk of catastrophe,\" said Mr. Cline. And models that rely on the American economy do not take into account the devastation of, for instance, hurricanes in Bangladesh after ocean levels rise.\n\"It's very difficult for economists to conceive of cataclysm,\" said David Batker, an economist for the environmental organization Greenpeace.\nThe debate is apt to continue long after the Rio meeting adjourns. \"If science were more certain that we were going to hell in a handbasket,\" said Mr. Hahn, \"you'd get more consensus.\""}, {"text": "Island Nations Fear a Rise in the Sea\n1992-02-17T05:00:00.000Z\nRepresentatives of 37 island nations that fear they may disappear beneath the waves if the world grows any warmer are voicing their concern at the slow pace toward an agreement on stabilizing the global climate.\nThese nations, including Cyprus and Malta in the Mediterranean, the Caribbean islands and archipelagos around the Pacific, say their existence is threatened by the rise of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that contribute to the melting of the polar ice caps, which raises the ocean's level.\nWarmer climates can also intensify hurricanes and tropical storms and kill coral reefs that protect island coastlines and harbor rich shoals of shrimp and fish.\nThese nations, which make up the Alliance of Small Island States, came together on Friday to prepare for a session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change on Tuesday. The group wants to draft an agreement before the \"Earth Summit\" in June in Rio de Janeiro.\nBut square brackets indicating objections still surround almost every sentence in the draft agreement on stabilizing the quantity of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere, mainly through the burning of fossil fuels.\n\"The Alliance of Small Island States members are doomed to ecological, social and economic catastrophe within the foreseeable future,\" Danielle de St. Jorre, the Seychelles Minister of Planning and External Relations, told the meeting Friday. \"Some will even disappear. And if that happens they will take with them cultures, identities and values which are irreplaceable.\"\nRobert F. Van Lierop, United Nations representative of Vanuatu, in the southern Pacific, said, \"It's a question of survival, it's that simple. At the very least, sea level rises of a foot or so could wipe out island ecosystems. At worst, whole islands could disappear under water.\"\nNoel J. Brown of the United Nations Environment Program, said, \"We are facing a whole new category of ecological refugees.\" 4-Inch Rise in a Century\nEvidence suggests that sea levels have risen by 4 to 6 inches in the last century, and the median forecast is for a further rise of 8 inches by 2030 and 26 inches by 2100, said John C. Topping, president of the Climate Institute in Washington, D.C.\nAlready many of these islands are feeling the effects.\nMrs. de St. Jorre said tourist beaches are shrinking and noted that the Seychelles had to build special dikes to protect reclaimed land and sea-level industrial developments. Four tiny islands in the Maldives are being evacuated because of flooding.\nThe sense that they are already becoming the first victims of global warming gives the island states an urgency that they feel puts them at odds with the political priorities of the northern industrial countries and the larger developing nations.\nAll Western industrialized countries except the United States are ready to commit to stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by 2000, but many will only do so if the United States changes its position. Saudi Arabia and several other oil-producing states, for example, are lined up with the United States against setting any binding new targets for emission levels because they fear that this will reduce demand for oil.\nJapan wants to stabilize emissions at about 9 per cent higher than in 1990 to allow for population growth.\nAnd for the bigger developing countries, like India and Brazil, the top priority is to insure that any agreement does not restrict their economic development and that the industrial north, which is responsible for over 80 per cent of the carbon dioxide already in the air, curbs its own emissions.\nNevertheless, larger countries may have as much incentive to stabilize sea levels as small island states, according to Stephen P. Leatherman, director of the Laboratory for Coastal Research at the University of Maryland.\nA three-foot rise in ocean levels would render 72 million people homeless in China, 11 million in Bangladesh and 8 million in Egypt, or four times the island states' entire population of 23 million, he said."}, {"text": "NEWS SUMMARY\n1992-01-02T05:00:00.000Z\nINTERNATIONAL A2-12 SALVADOR ACCORD: PEACE AT LAST?\nThe Salvadoran peace agreement reached at the U.N. will bring an almost immediate truce in the 12-year civil war, and by autumn, disbanding of the five rebel armies, Government and rebel officials said.

Most likely, he had been carrying home the night's tips, usually $60 or so. The Feel of the City\n\"He loved America,\" said Gregory Frederick. \"He loved the feel of the city.\" Mr. Frederick, a waiter at Sfuzzi, said he had known Mr. Ahad for more than a year. \"It's so unfortunate that one person who is trying to live the American dream has his life taken away by some 16-year-old for a buck.\"\nA witness told the police that Mr. Ahad was fatally shot when he tried to follow the thieves, described as three boys and a girl 15 or 16 years old, after they took his money.\nAs Mr. Ahad's brothers and friends gathered sorrowfully in his apartment yesterday afternoon, and fellow employees recalled him at Sfuzzi, on West 65th Street, some in the city's Bangladeshi community expressed anger at what they said were growing instances in which members of the community were victimized. They added that the authorities were not doing enough in response.\n\"This was a robbery and brutal murder, but also we're harassed all over the city,\" Mohammod M. Rohman, who works for a Brooklyn insurance agency and is from the same Bangladeshi town, Beanibazar, that Mr. Ahad came from five years ago, said angrily as he joined other mourners in the victim's apartment. \"People are walking, they're called names, they're beat up, spit on.\"\nHe asserted that the police did not pursue complaints of such incidents with sufficient vigor, adding that many such encounters took place in Ozone Park and adjoining areas of Queens and Brooklyn, where he said several thousand people of Bangladeshi background lived, out of about 50,000 in New York City.\nA Police Department spokesman, Detective Joseph McConville, responded that police officials in those areas said they did not know of concentrated incidents of harassment of people from Bangladesh. Quiet and Hard-Working\nBut for Mr. Ahad's relatives, friends and co-workers, all this was of little interest as they described a quiet, friendly and hard-working man. At Sfuzzi he was a kitchen waiter and food runner, who assembled the food on plates in the kitchen and brought the meals to the dining room.\nThrough an interpreter, one of the brothers he lived with, Abdul Asad, 19, said there were two other brothers and a sister and their parents back in Beanibazar, where their father is a businessman selling food and spices.\n\"He says he can hardly express it in words but he feels terribly bad,\" Muhammad Kalam said of Abdul Asad, who sat dazed in the apartment at 81-43 102d Road that he shared with the victim and others, including another brother, Abdus Salam, 30."}, {"text": "Immigrants' Fear of Forms Imperils Aid to Schools\n1992-11-07T05:00:00.000Z\nWhen Lyubov Golant was told to sign a standard government form to qualify her son for free lunch at a Brooklyn public school last fall, her first reflex was fear.\nAfter years of having to answer prying questions from Soviet authorities before getting a job or even a library card, she was suspicious of giving the school personal information like her family's income, the number of people in her household and whether they were on welfare.\n\"It's in our blood to be scared,\" said the 30-year-old woman, who left Moscow with her 8-year-old son, Yevgeny, five months ago. \"In Russia, we learned to say not what we really think and to think not what we really say.\"\nMrs. Golant's hesitance was only momentary. But many of the city's new immigrant families are unwilling to fill out such forms, a reluctance that is costing schools with large foreign-born populations hundreds of thousands of dollars in Federal aid, said Robin Wilner, executive director of strategic planning for the school system. Main Poverty Indicator for Schools\nWith the number of foreign-born schoolchildren on the rise in recent years, getting the forms -- which are the main poverty indicator used in the schools -- has become more and more pressing for the schools. The forms not only make children eligible for a free lunch, but they are used to qualify for the Chapter 1 Federal aid program, which pays for extra tutoring and special classes for low-achieving poor children.\nCurrently, 7 of the 649 schools in the city that became eligible for such aid this school year have lost it, and 17 risk losing it, because they were not able to collect enough lunch application forms, school and union officials say. In most cases, the schools losing out have large immigrant populations, the officials said. The loss of funds will result in fewer teachers, aides, reduced class sizes and developmental programs in those schools.\nMany parents are like Mrs. Golant, immigrants or refugees from countries governed by harsh laws and dictatorships. In some cases, however, the parents refuse to sign because they find it shameful to accept what they see as welfare. Still others are here illegally, and fear that such forms will eventually be used to track them down and deport them.\n\"With the recent spate of immigrants from so many countries that are at war or in political turmoil, it's a growing new problem,\" said Susan Amlung, a spokeswoman for the United Federation of Teachers.\nDifficulty in getting immigrants to fill out forms is not confined to the New York schools. Other key ports of entry, including Miami, Boston, Los Angeles and Houston, see it, too. Innocent Requests Can Chill\n\"Immigrant parents are easily put off by any kind of request for information,\" said Joan First, executive co-director of the National Coalition of Advocates for Students, a group based in Boston. \"The requests may be very innocent on the part of the school people and may not have any intent to chill the parents' relationship with the school, but it still may have that outcome.\"\nAbout 150,000 immigrants from 167 countries have enrolled in the city's schools in the last four years, said the schools' chief spokesman, James S. Vlasto.\n\"As this immigrant population increases, it's going to be even more difficult,\" Mr. Vlasto said. \"It takes a lot of work to help these people assimilate into the school system. They're fearful of the government. Where they come from, they're looking over their shoulder. They're afraid of answering the phone or even giving out their mailing address.\"\nOfficials are also worried that a second problem will emerge next year. The pool of Federal funds that New York City receives could shrink by more than $50 million because of a change in the Federal allocation formula, which will use 1990 Census figures for the first time, they said.\n\"The same families who don't want to fill out the lunch forms are not picked up in the 1990 Census, so we will not get credit for these families, and we're serving their children,\" said Ms. Wilner. \"It's a problem we have that is going to be a national issue.\"\nNew York's school system received $432 million in Chapter I aid for the 1992-93 school year. Elementary schools that qualify average about $500,000 in Chapter I aid. To be eligible, schools must show that at least 59.08 percent of their students are living below a certain family income level; the lunch forms are the most common proof. A school that cannot collect enough forms forfeits the Federal aid, and its share is then distributed to other schools that do qualify. But it leaves some schools with a large immigrant population -- often in need of a great deal of remedial help in reading and math -- at a severe disadvantage.\nIn an effort to get the forms signed this year, some schools have enlisted the help of community organizations that have a foothold in immigrant neighborhoods. Others have tried home visits, telephone calls and private meetings in the principal's office in an effort to convince parents that they will benefit from signing.\n\"We mingle with them in the schoolyard and we also make calls,\" said Joseph Silverstone, the principal of P.S. 225, whose large Russian population includes Mrs. Golant's son. His staff, which speaks to parents in their native language, has collected all but 11 lunch forms from the school's 660 students. \"You have to understand what they've overcome to come to this country,\" he said.\nIn Community School District 4, where a wave of immigrants from Mexico and Central America have flooded the schools of East Harlem, school officials have tried to soothe parents' fears with meetings that focus on the confidential nature of the forms and their relationship to the Federal aid received by the school.\n\"These are the front-line realities that schools have to deal with,\" said Wilfredo Laboy, the district's director of student development and pupil personnel services. \"We have newly arrived people coming from countries that have been abusive of power. They don't understand the connectedness between the services and these applications.\"\nAt Seward Park High School on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where many students are from China, Burma, Bangladesh, Central America and the Caribbean, dozens of free lunch applications are neatly stacked by color according to language; pink for Chinese, green for Spanish and white for English.\nBut Jeannette Goldstein, a tart-tongued school aide who is known affectionately as the Lunch Lady, said some students seem to prefer an empty stomach rather than accept a free lunch coupon from her. 'Don't Care What You Offer'\n\"I plead with them. We joke with them. We try to induce them,\" said Mrs. Goldstein, a 64-year-old school aide. \"The ones who are not willing don't care what you offer them. They just say they don't want.\"\nThe other day, Mrs. Goldstein was riffling through at least 60 admission slips of students who had not returned lunch application forms. She balled a fist tight in frustration.\n\"A lot of them come from poor areas but they don't want any lunch,\" she said, rattling off students' addresses. \"East Broadway -- I know that building is a walkup. It's probably still an old tenement with bathtubs in the kitchen or in the hallway.\"\nAt a desk behind Mrs. Goldstein, Ellen Wong, an assistant who interprets for the large Chinese population at Seward Park High, monitored a telephone. One of her jobs is to call parents who work in garment factories in Chinatown when they have not returned the lunch forms. Welfare Question Ignored\nMost of the lunch forms for Asian students are eventually collected, the school assistant said. But, she added, when they are asked whether they are on welfare, about 80 percent of the Asian families refuse to answer.\n\"They're embarrassed,\" she said. \"They do not go for welfare. They don't want people to look down on them. I try to explain, 'You need it.' They go home and think about it.\"\nA feeling of shame about handouts is shared by many immigrants, whether they are Asian, Haitian or Russian like Mrs. Golant, who feared that she and her son would be viewed as \"a second sort of people.\"\nA school system spokesman, Robert Terte, said the free-lunch forms, which also ask for the Social Security number of the adult household member, are kept confidential in the schools and are not shared with agencies like the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Still, some school employees say the forms have the power to terrify many immigrants. 'I Can't Take a Chance'\n\"They freeze when they see the Social Security number,\" said Jerry Cioffi, the principal of Prospect Heights High School in Brooklyn. \"They say 'I'm undocumented, Mr. Cioffi, and I can't take a chance.' Some of them have left Haiti and a very repressed Government. They're not here properly and they don't have a Social Security number. The downside outweighs the upside. The downside, in their minds, is that if the Federal Government gets this information, they could be deported.\"\nProspect Heights High, where three-quarters of the students are immigrants and mostly Caribbean, needs to collect 1,500 lunch applications, but by the last week in October the school had retrieved only 600 forms. Because the collection numbers are so low, Prospect Heights High risks losing 10 teachers and aides next year who help children in remedial math and reading.\nFor one family from Peru, whose 9-year-old son attends a public school in the Bronx, signing the forms became the basis of a heated argument.\nThe father, who insisted on anonymity, is here illegally, though his wife has proper documentation. Signing is considered a terrible risk by the father, who looks for work on construction crews. He said he told his wife that he might be hunted down.\nHe and his wife ultimately compromised. She filled out the form, making no mention of his existence.\n\"We considered not signing it, but we also understand that the person who would suffer is the baby,\" he said."}, {"text": "IN THEIR OWN WORDS; Excerpts From Remarks Delivered by Jackson and Carter at the Convention\n1992-07-15T05:00:00.000Z\nFollowing are excerpts from remarks delivered at the Democratic National Convention by the Rev. Jesse Jackson and former President Jimmy Carter, as transcribed by The New York Times. Rev. Jesse Jackson\nPresident Bill Clinton, you have survived -- you have survived a tough spring. It will make you stronger for the fall. With your stripes you must heal and make us better. The hopes of many depend upon your quest. Be comforted that you do not stand alone.\nAnd now that it look like you are going to win the race in November, people are already lining up outside of your hotel to get a job or an appointment. Just remember when you get to the White House that I put Hope, Ark., on the map by saying keep Hope, Ark., alive all over America.\nVice President Al Gore, in years past Republicans would always talk about a stature gap. But this time around, they have a Vice President who cannot spell \"potato,\" and our candidate can spell \"fluorofluorocarboantidisestablishmentarianism\" at the same time -- Al Gore.\nI want to thank Al Gore for his work as environmental leader, a supporter of social justice, an original sponsor of D.C. statehood.\nWe stand as witnesses to a pregnant moment in history. Across the globe, we feel the pain that comes with new birth. Here in our country pain abounds. We must be certain that it leads to new birth and not a tragic miscarriage of opportunity. We must turn pain to power; pain to partnership, and not pain to polarization.\nThe great temptation in these difficult days of racial polarization and economic injustice is to make political arguments black and white and miss the moral imperative of wrong and right. Vanity asks, \"Is it popular?\" Politics asks, \"Will it win?\" Morality and conscience ask, \"Is it right?\"\nWe are part of the continuing struggle for justice and decency, linked in a chain that began long before we were born and will extend long after we are gone. History will remember us not for our positioning but for our principles. Not by a move to the political center, left or right, but rather by our grasp on the moral and ethical center of wrong and right.\nWe who stand with working people and poor have a special burden. We must stand for what is right; stand up to those who have the might. We do so grounded in the faith that that which is morally wrong will never be politically right. But if it is morally sound, it will eventually be politically right.\nBy my standing here tonight and looking into your faces, I hear the pain and see the struggles that prepared the ground that you stand on. We've come a long way from where we started a generation ago it seemed, in 1964. Fannie Lou Hamer from Sunflower County, Miss., Fannie Lou Hamer had to fight even to sit in this convention. Tonight, 28 years later, the chair of the party is Ron Brown from Harlem; the manager is Alexis Herman, an African-American woman from Mobile, Ala. We've come a long way.\nAnd yet we're more interdependent than we realize. Not only African-Americans benefited from the movement led by Dr. King for justice. It was only when African-Americans in the South were free to win those states to Bill Clinton and Al Gore from that same South take this rostrum to lead our country into the next century.\nTonight, we face another challenge. Ten million Americans unemployed, 25 million on food stamps, 35 million in poverty, 40 million have no health care. From the coal miners in Big Stone Gap, W. Va., to the loggers and environmentalists in Roseburg, Ore., from displaced textile workers in my home town of Greenville, S.C., the plant closing in Van Nuys, Calif., pain abounds. . . .\nThere is, there is a harshness to America that comes from not seeing and growing mindless materialism. Our television sets bring the world into our living rooms, but too often we overlook our neighbors.\nIt was there in Hamlet, N.C., 25 workers died in a fire at Imperial Foods, more women than men, more white than black. They worked making chicken parts in vats heated to 400 degrees with few windows and no fans. The owners locked the doors from the outside. The women died. He said he locked the doors because they may steal some chicken wings. These women died trapped by economic desperation and oppressive work laws.\nOne woman came up to me after the fire and said, \"Rev. Jackson, I want to work. I don't want to be on welfare. I have three children and no husband.\" She said, \"I plucks 90 wings a minute. Some times I can't bend my wrists; I catches this carpal thing\" -- talking about the carpal syndrome. \"And then when we get hurts and can't bend our wristses, then we can't get no medical care.\" . . . \"Then they fires us, 'cause we cripple. And then they called us lazy bitch.\"\nAnd she began to cry. And I said, \"You are not lazy, and you are not bitch, and you are not alone, and a change is coming. We stand with you.\"\nHer friend, a white woman came up to me and said, \"Let me have your other shoulder. I'm seven months pregnant. We're standing in two inches of water with two five-minute bathroom breaks a day, sometimes we can't hold our water. And then our bowels break and then we faint.\"\nWe work together and we keep Hamlet, N.C., in our hearts and before our eyes.\nWe will act to empower working people, we will protect the right to organize and to strike. We will empower workers, we will empower workers to enforce health and safety laws, we'll provide a national health care system, a minimum wage sufficient to bring workers out of poverty and paid parental leave. We must build a movement for economic justice across this nation. This land is our land.\nTonight we face a difficult challenge. Our cities have been abandoned, farmers forsaken, children neglected, floods in Chicago, fires in Los Angeles. They say they cannot find $35 billion for our mayors but the latest down payment for S.& L. bailout thieves is $25 billion. If we can find the money to bail out S.& L. thieves we can find the money to bail out American cities. . . .\nWe cannot become isolationists. We must reach out. Let us not forget in 1939 900 Jews left Germany coming to America for freedom. They got within Miami Beach, Fla., eyesight. U.S. authorities turned the 900 Jews, mostly women and children, around on the ship called the St. Louis. They got back to Germany. Hitler killed them and said to them, No one would accept you. It was anti-Semitic and wrong to lock them out. But guess what, 1942.\nYou saw young Kristi Yamaguchi skating to glory in the Olympics a few months ago. Her mother was born in an American concentration camp, 120,000 Japanese-Americans locked up while they fought to help us win the Second World War. If it were wrong and anti-Semitic to lock the Jews out in 1939, if it were wrong to lock the Japanese-Americans up in 1942 it's wrong to lock the Haitians out in 1992.\nTonight, South Africa remains a terrorist state. Sanctions should be reimposed until there's an interim government established in South Africa.\nLastly, there's a lot of talk these days about family values. Even as we spurn the homeless on the street remember Jesus was born to a homeless couple, outdoors in a stable in the winter. Jesus was a child of a single mother. When Mary said Joseph, when, when Mary said Joseph was not the father she was abused and questioned. If Mary had aborted the baby she would have been called immoral. If she had the baby she would have been called unfit, without family values. But Mary had family values. It was Herrod, the Quayle of his day, who put no value on the family. . . .\nAnd I say this to you tonight as we proceed toward November in all of this ugliness there is hope. There is still that silver lining in the cloud. Let us not forget. We talk a lot about Rodney King and how the white police beat him and how the white jury freed them and how racist that was, and it was. But lest you forget, unless a white man named George Holiday with a sense of conscience and instinct, had not George Haliday filmed the beating, and made it public tonight Rodney King would be in jail accused of assaulting police officers. He is a genuine port of light.\nBut then on the other side of town you saw the white truck driver beaten on television. It was wrong. It was wrong for the police to withdraw from their duty. But those police did not save Mr. Denny. It was four young black youths operating as good Samaritans. They saved his life. There is hope. There is hope. . . .\nAll of us are not born giants with silver spoons in our mouths and gold slippers on our feet; some of us are born short, short of hope, short of opportunity, abandoned, neglected, homeless, motherless, teeth crooked, eyes tangled, dreams busted -- hurt! But somebody has to measure their giantness not by leaping up but by reaching back and reaching out and loving and caring and sharing. Democrats, if we pursue that ethic, that love ethic, that care ethic, we will win. Jimmy Carter\nWith Federal funding slashed to the bone for instance, there are now 10 times as many homeless people in Atlanta, Ga., as there were when I left the White House. Violent crimes, violent crimes among juveniles have increased 300% in just the last five years. Their lack of hope for a better life seems to be equaled among America's leaders.\nThose in the White House, the Congress, governors' mansions, mayors' offices, corporate boardrooms, and even university campuses have come to doubt that anything they do can make a difference in crime, juvenile delinquency, drug additions, homelessness or unemployment. I do not believe that the hopelessness is justified and this country must do something about it.\nIncreasingly concerned about the plight of families in our inner cities We at the Carter Center have embarked on what we call the Atlanta Project. . . .\nNow, Atlanta is a wonderful city, prosperous, progressive, and blessed with good race relations. But there are two Atlantas. I've been Governor and President of these same Georgia neighbors, but my recent visits among them has been an education to me. I've learned why many pregnant women will not seek prenatal care, why one-fourth of all the public housing apartments are boarded up and unused despite a long waiting list for occupancy.\nI've visited a middle school where the primary problem with young boys is that their measure of success in life, their achievement of stature among their peers is to own a semi-automatic weapon. I've learned that the pregnancy rate was highest in the lower grades among girls because the pimps and the drug pushers prefer sex with the little ones who are cheaper, less able to defend themselves and less likely to have AIDS.\nI've visited hut villages with homes the size of minibuses where one resident was trying to teach the others how to read, another had helped the neighbors to build their houses and they rotated the boiling of water from street sewers and then shared it equally with the other families.\nThey were not furnished running water or portable toilets in hopes that they would move out of the neighborhood.\nThis is a great city in America and not the slums of Haiti, Bangladesh, or Uganda. And this has got to change."}, {"text": "Japan's Choice -- Scour Technology's Stain With Technology\n1992-10-04T05:00:00.000Z\nStephen Hesse, an American Lawyer who lives in Japan and teaches courses on international environmental law at Yokohama City University, asks his Japanese students on the first day of class to give examples of what they consider major environmental problems. In one recent survey, two answers he got were \"bad breath\" and \"old men on bicycles.\" \nFrom a Japanese perspective the answers make sense because, historically, environmental problems, or \nkankyo mondai, \nhave been defined as conditions that rend the fabric of society, not the web of nature. Old men on bicycles disrupt pedestrian and automobile traffic and sometimes cause actual injuries.\nThe Japanese word for \"pollution,\" \nkogai, \nis literally \"public nuisance,\" and refers generally to any disruption of the smooth flow of civic life: traffic jams, drought, vibrations from passing subway trains or a new skyscraper blocking a neighborhood's sunlight. This social definition of pollution, absent of ecological meaning, is the result of a society that fast-forwarded from feudalism to modernity without passing through that distinctively Western phase known as \"greening.\" Which is not to say that Japan has not had to tackle serious environmental pollution problems, or that a sizable number of Japanese have not adopted the language and gestures of Western environmentalism. They have, but without embracing the underlying values that inspire Western environmentalists.\nThousands of Japanese on several occasions have paddled in canoes to giant construction caissons in the Nagara River, a major waterway in central Japan. There, in perfect synchronization, the canoeists have raised their paddles and bellowed their protest against the $1.1 billion barrier being built across the mouth of the Nagara.\nWhat are their objections to the dam? They believe it is poorly designed, will increase the chance of floods and, by driving a species of river trout extinct, put fishermen out of work. The protesters' goal, therefore, is not to preserve the Nagara in a wild state. That is a Western ideal. Most Japanese value nature the way Westerners admire a painting or sculpture -- for the artful layering-on of human workmanship and design. \"Wild\" nature has no more value than a lump of clay before a sculptor shapes it.\nIn any event, the Nagara -- at least to Western eyes -- is a bonsai tree of a river with its once-wild banks trimmed and tidied by shoguns and farmers and fishermen down through the centuries. This does not stop the Nagara dam protesters from rallying around Western environmental slogans. Reiko Amano, a 38-year-old nature writer, explains that her leadership of the grass-roots movement against the Nagara dam is based on her determination to \"save the last natural river in Japan.\" Queried about her use of the word \"natural,\" Amano says: \"The Nagara River is not real nature. There's not much real nature left in Japan. It's what you might call secondary nature -- nature created by man. And the Nagara is the best model we have of that in Japan, so it must be preserved.\" \nIn certain respects, the Japanese, whose keen interest in nature is reflected in haiku poetry, screen painting, Zen meditation and garden design, would seem to be environmentally progressive. They are avid recyclers and their industries are highly energy-efficient. Some Western environmentalists even consider Japan an ideal model of a developed nation that has successfully balanced the often conflicting claims of economic growth and environmental health. Faced with an outbreak of pollution-related diseases in the 1950's and 60's -- the result of unchecked economic hypergrowth -- Japan in 1970 enacted some of the world's toughest antipollution laws. At great expense, Japanese industry invested in smokestack scrubbers and water purification devices, and later went on to capture large overseas market shares with these and other pollution-curbing products. The environmental laws worked, and without significantly slowing the country's economic growth.\nJapanese industries are looking closely at how they will do business in a world increasingly concerned about global warming and ozone depletion. And it was as a champion of the \"technofix\" approach to environmental problems that Japan attended the June Earth Summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro. There, Japan consistently chose a progressive course. It pledged $7.7 billion over the next five years for a variety of environmental foreign aid programs -- the largest sum promised by any nation. It also pledged to hold its per capita greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000 and it signed a treaty to protect global biodiversity. (The United States took neither step on the grounds that they might harm business interests and slow economic growth.) \nJapan's bold moves made it the star of the summit. But by championing the idea that in better technology lies the salvation of the environment, Japan has made itself the focal point of a furious debate among environmentalists. That argument pits Japan and other proponents of the technofix approach against those who say that only a profound change in human values will save the earth. \nMany environmentalists familiar with Japanese politics and society point out that Japan's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is predicated on the successful completion of its program to build about 40 nuclear power plants in the country over the next 25 years. Nuclear power is considered by Japan to be environmentally sound because it generates no carbon dioxide, the leading greenhouse gas. \nJapan's critics question both the intent and the likely effects of the $7.7 billion environmental foreign aid commitment. The world's largest disburser of foreign aid, Japan in 1990 had a direct foreign aid budget of $7.5 billion, with $1.2 billion earmarked for \"environmental\" needs. But critics say that Japanese environmental aid invariably serves Japanese commercial purposes more than local needs. For example, a $2 billion dam has been built largely with Japanese foreign aid in Asahan, Indonesia, ostensibly to provide electricity and economic stimulus to the undeveloped region. But the roads, bridge and port built as part of the dam complex are largely used by Japanese companies running an aluminum refinery, which also uses most of the electricity produced by the dam. \nIn fact, in recent years, Japan the global economic power has become known as an environmental despoiler. Its commercial whaling fleet roamed the oceans until a worldwide ban, in 1986, finally compelled it to stop. (Japan continues to kill 300 minke whales a year for \"scientific research.\") A United Nations resolution last year ordered Japan's drift-net fishing fleet to stop that practice by this December. Japan is the world's largest importer of rain forest timber, mostly from Malaysia, and it has not slowed down those imports. Throughout Southeast Asia, its major sphere of influence, Japan is under increasing attack for exporting polluting industries. \nThat trend began in the 1970's, when the combination of Japan's growing economy and strict new environmental laws led hundreds of manufacturers to look for lower wages and laxer environmental laws in the developing countries of Asia. Since then, numerous Japanese export pollution cases have cropped up. Heavy-metal poisoning was found in people living around Jakarta Bay, Indonesia, where many Japanese manufacturers operate factories. Philippine citizens groups have documented severe air and water pollution near a copper smelter owned by a consortium of Marubeni, a major trading company, and other Japanese companies. Recently, a Malaysian court ordered a mineral refinery operated by Mitsubishi Kasei, a Japanese chemical manufacturer, to shut down; a lawsuit brought by Malaysian villagers charged the factory with dumping radioactive waste, a byproduct of the refining process, on their farmland and in their drinking water. (The factory, now closed, is appealing the order.)\nAnd despite the claim by Japanese politicians that their country's success in fighting its pollution crises of the 1960's render it a model for solving global problems in the 1990's and beyond, the facts suggest otherwise. The strong antipollution laws passed in 1970 were effective in addressing the most severe cases of air and water pollution, but continued economic growth in Japan since then has overwhelmed many of those gains. The 1970 laws, for instance, sharply reduced the allowable limits for polluting emissions from individual automobiles. But the increase in the number of automobiles has pushed air pollution levels back to hazardous levels in the big cities. Nitrogen dioxide levels in many cities have increased above 1970 levels and, according to a recent report from Japan's Environment Agency, have been linked to increasing rates of asthma in schoolchildren.\nJapan has its own history of environmental controversies. The most famous is the Ashio Copper Mine tragedy at the turn of the century. A copper baron made millions digging ore out of a mountainside in central Japan and in the process poisoned the drinking water and cropland of hundreds of farmers. After putting up with sickness and devastation for many years, the farmers finally organized mass protest marches at the Ministry of Agriculture in Tokyo. With a virtual rebellion at hand, serious negotiations at last began. But even though the Government ordered the mining company to meet strict pollution controls, they were poorly enforced, and both the pollution and the litigation continued for decades. Substantial financial compensation to farmers living near the mine was not paid until 1974.\nIn the Ashio Copper Mine disaster, as in hundreds of subsequent cases in Japan, environmental problems have been discussed in terms of land rights, compensation claims, breaches of social contracts and reparations. Saving scenic beauty for human enjoyment, or protecting wilderness, or preserving the plants and animals indigenous to a region -- the standard repertory of Western environmental goals -- has, until recently, not been part of the discussion in Japan.\nWhat the Japanese have done is devise a number of highly commendable environmental practices. Japan is a world leader in paper recycling. Pickup trucks drive through residential neighborhoods once a week, picking up bundles of used newspapers left on the curb and handing out rolls of toilet paper to householders. People carry handkerchiefs to dry hands after washing (paper towels are scarce in public bathrooms). To save energy, overhead electric lights in homes have three settings, from dim to bright. Most toilets have a \"weak flush\" option to save water. Even with chilly winters, homes are not centrally heated, but are warmed with space heaters, one room at a time.\nDespite its recycling prowess, however, Japan today faces a garbage crisis. The increasing volume of consumer goods in Japan since 1970 has overwhelmed available landfills, incinerators and recycling plants. Tokyo's main dump site, a landfill in Tokyo Bay called Dream Island, is filled to overflowing, and a new dump site has not been completed. \nAlthough paper towels aren't offered in most public bathrooms, a flood of waste paper comes from other quarters of Japanese society. Comics the size of telephone books are sold like daily newspapers at train stations and discarded in overflowing bins. In department stores, items are inevitably wrapped and bagged three or more times. A dozen postcards will come in a dozen bags -- actually 13, including the one the dozen are bagged in.\nUntil recent months, \nsodai gomi\n, or \"big garbage\" piles, were a common sight in residential neighborhoods. Looking like heaps of new products just dropped off at curbside by delivery trucks, these mountains of practically new televisions, stereos, rice cookers and other appliances were, in fact, waiting for the garbage truck. A Japanese aversion to secondhand goods, a passion for the very latest products and the small size of Japanese apartments induce city dwellers to throw away perfectly usable merchandise. Many a foreigner's home in Japan has been amply furnished with pickings from these curbside treasure troves. \nJapan's current economic troubles and new stiff carting fees have diminished the big garbage problem somewhat, though the Tokyo metropolitan government is still waging war on people leaving hardly used goods on back streets and other illegal dump sites. According to the Tokyo city government, often good-as-new items from sodai gomi piles dumped into the Tokyo Bay landfill in 1990 included 128,029 television sets, 99,006 refrigerators, 88,841 washing machines, 20,352 microwave ovens, 28,152 vacuum cleaners, 10,431 electric organs, 189,753 bicycles, 124 pianos, 78 cars, 1,531 motorcycles, 424,904 chairs, 13,702 baby strollers and 13,212 kitchen sinks.\nBesides the worsening air quality and garbage problems, a third environmental crisis now looms. From the northern island of Hokkaido to the southernmost tip of Okinawa, giant public works projects, resort hotels and golf courses are tearing into the landscape. This flood tide of development is a result of Japanese Government policy to use public works spending, and subsidies to private development, to stimulate the economy. No different from United States Federal and state government policies, such projects have a greater impact on the environment because the country's territory is so small. In 1991, Japan committed 43 trillion yen ($330 billion) a year to public works projects through the year 2001. This year, with the economy slumping, the Government passed an additional $87 billion stimulative plan, mostly for public works. \nA foreign policy crisis in Japan in 1985 hastened the procession of bulldozers into the Japanese countryside. Responding to international pressure to slow its exports, Japan strengthened the yen and in one stroke weakened its exporting industries, a pillar of the economy. One measure enacted to compensate for that loss was an increase in public works spending. The National Resort Law of 1987, which many believe to be the single greatest threat to Japan's environment today, threw open vast areas of previously protected national parkland to resort development. Although officially designated parks comprise 14 percent of Japan's total land mass, much of these areas are heavily developed with roads, houses, golf courses and resorts. Furthermore, most of the parklands have been commercially reforested in recent decades, the new trees planted in straight parallel rows, many to be eventually cut down for timber. (Actual wilderness areas comprise only 0.015 percent of Japan's total land mass.) \nEvidence that Japan's natural environment is creaking dangerously under all the developmental strain is more anecdotal than statistical. First-time visitors to Japan are often shocked at how little undeveloped countryside is left in Japan. Garish pachinko parlors lighted with neon signs rise up in otherwise sleepy farm towns. Tunnels are blasted through mountains to reach small fishing villages. High-voltage electric wires crisscross national parks. Golf courses are carved into mountainsides. Soda vending machines are scattered around sacred temple grounds. \nWhat statistics there are tell a similar story. In Japan, 8.1 percent of the known bird species are endangered, as compared with 3.5 percent in Canada and 7.2 percent in the United States, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which keeps data on developed countries. More than half of Japan's seacoast and about one-third of its wetlands -- vital buffers between sea and land and the areas supporting plants and animals, or biodiversity -- have been landfilled. As a result of heavy soil runoffs caused by resort development, the coral reefs of Okinawa, which once ringed those islands like a brilliant necklace, are now 95 percent dead or dying, according to Katherine Muzik, a marine biologist based in Boston who spent eight years in Japan studying marine life.\nIN THE MEANTIME, seemingly unable to carry out foreign trade without causing friction, Japanese political leaders have identified environmental aid as the one area in which they hope to exert a positive influence around the world. Japan's qualification? Having fought the severe domestic industrial pollution of the 1960's. \nThere was the much-publicized Minamata mercury poisoning epidemic, in which dozens of people died and hundreds were crippled after eating fish tainted by industrial waste. In Tokyo, air pollution got so bad that some traffic cops used oxygen masks and children fainted in schoolyards. An emergency session of Government -- the Pollution Diet of 1970 -- passed what were then some of the world's toughest antipollution laws. Japan's worst pollution problems cleared up and Tokyo's air quality improved dramatically. At least for a while.\n\"Japan's experience testifies that environment and economic growth can coexist,\" says Kazuo Aichi, a former director general of Japan's Environment Agency who remains active in promoting the idea of Japanese environmental aid abroad. \"We can act as a bridge between the first and third worlds.\" \nJapan envisions a large transfer of antipollution technology to needy countries as part of its contribution to solving global environmental problems. \"It's really just a question of getting the right technologies to the right places, at an affordable price,\" says Jun Okumura, an official with environmental policy experience at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.\nOver the past two years, largely under the ministry's direction, 16 of the country's leading industrial manufacturers have established a joint research project to invent commercially viable technologies that will not harm the environment. One goal is to design a kind of smokestack scrubber that will extract carbon dioxide, a leading greenhouse gas, from factory emissions. This is much more complex technologically than removing sulfur or nitrogen from waste gases.\nThis approach is winning plaudits from some environmentalists. \"The truth is that only a new environmental revolution in technology is going to save the planet's environment,\" says Gustave Speth, president of World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank in Washington. \"We are going to need dramatic technological changes in industry, manufacturing, transportation, energy and agriculture. I think Japan can lead the way, and it doesn't bother me a bit that they plan to make a yen by doing good.\"\nBut environmentalists who favor improved human values over improved technologies argue that Japan's technofix approach is not only misguided but dangerous, since it fails to consider ecological limits to economic growth. \"There's a basic insensitivity to the large picture of the environment,\" says Stephen Hesse of Yokohama City University. \"It's an unwillingness to perceive that there is an overarching concept of ecology that has to be recognized, ecosystems that have to be protected. Both nationally and globally, Japan is not doing that.\"\nOpponents of Japan's technofix approach are particularly critical of research -- popularly designated \"global superprojects\" -- being carried out by several of the nation's largest construction companies and a number of think tanks. Superprojects include theoretical schemes to install an atmospheric control switch in the form of a dam across the Bering Strait, enormous dams high in the Himalayas to prevent flooding in Bangladesh and a ring of solar panels installed in countries circling the globe at the equator, with branch lines running to the northern and southern hemispheres. \nThe most advanced of the schemes is one called \"Greening the Sahara Desert.\" Several Japanese construction companies, all vying for environmental foreign aid disbursements they believe will one day come, have each drawn up different models. One envisions colossal aqueducts -- stretching from the Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean to the desert -- connected to huge desalting plants. Other models: seeding the desert with trees, building huge underground reservoirs and injecting the desert with vast globs of water-retaining polymer gel. \nThis scheme may seem like Buck Rogers by way of Rube Goldberg, impossible politically and financially if not technologically. Yet major Japanese construction companies are working on the designs, saying they are committed to the long haul, and Government ministries have signaled their interest in this and other superprojects. Most importantly, these projects provide a window into Japan's basic attitude toward man and nature. \nFrom the Japanese perspective, the superprojects are designed to serve a world in economic harmony. The word \nkeizai, \nor \"economy,\" has broader connotations than the English word. The word carries with it the notion of political and spiritual guidance of social life by an all-powerful bureaucracy. The image of a beautiful green earth is appealing, but it is secondary to the more fundamental ideal of a sound economic-political-spiritual body. Fix the economy first, and the ecology will take care of itself. \n\"We consider any kind of environmental damage to result from mismanagement of the economy,\" says Norio Yamamoto, research director of the Mitsubishi Research Institute, a think tank that works on global superprojects. \"Look at the pollution problems of Eastern Europe. Where did they come from? Mismanagement of the economies. So we need a sound economy on a global basis.\"\nSays Jun Okumura of the trade ministry: \"We want to free ourselves of the environmental restraints to economic growth. Of course, we will never be entirely free of environmental constraints, but we should continue to look for ways to push those limits.\"\nPUSHING THOSE LIMIT has meant that for all the paddle-raising protests of the Nagara River dam, the dam's construction schedule has not been delayed for a single day. Nor, under Japanese law, could it have been, since there is no legal requirement for rigorous environmental impact studies. Nor is there a legal requirement to hold public hearings before large national construction projects begin.\nThe laws passed in the 1970's in response to the country's pollution crisis were exclusively antipollution laws, not nature conservation laws. The former protect humans, at the top of the food chain, from industrial wastes; the latter protect lower-ranking wildlife and their habitats from any sort of destruction.\nIn her 1962 classic work on agricultural pesticides, \"Silent Spring,\" Rachel Carson argued powerfully that human life was inextricably linked to the natural world, that vital ties connected the lowest organisms in the food chain to humans at the top. Throughout the 1960's, these and other ecological concepts became popularized, and with them the notion that devastation of one part of the global ecosystem would inevitably harm other parts. \nBy the mid-1970's, these concepts were encoded in United States law. The Environmental Protection Agency was formed in 1970, backed by regulatory laws designed to protect wilderness areas, to require environmental impact studies on Government construction projects and, after 1973, to protect endangered species. Dozens of environmental groups, which took it as their mission to be nature's advocate, were also formed. \nNone of this took place in Japan. Instead, the Japanese Government adopted laws and institutions that were superficially patterned after American models but that remained ineluctably Japanese. The Environment Agency formed in 1971 was patterned after the United States Environmental Protection Agency. But it has been a governmental orphan, with all significant regulatory powers stripped from it after turf battles with vastly more powerful agencies and ministries. Laws regarding endangered species, environmental impact assessments and so on have been drawn up, but they have been toothless statutes.\nIndeed, the Environment Agency is not empowered to regulate hazardous waste disposal, radioactive waste storage, the environmental impact of land use and development, water supply or ocean pollution. Many Government agencies are charged with both promoting and regulating certain industries. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry, for example, promotes trade at the same time that it regulates imports of endangered wildlife products -- like ivory and tortoise shell -- used by Japanese artisans. The Ministry of Health, which oversees Japan's water supply system, also monitors water safety. The Ministry of Construction, whose mandate is to carry out the Government's stimulative public works spending programs, is also responsible for conducting nonbinding environmental impact assessments of those projects. Not surprisingly, no major project has ever been stopped by the Environment Agency or the Ministry of Construction on environmental grounds. \nA close look at what passes for Japan's environmental movement reveals much the same picture. The largest and most active Japanese environmental group is the Wild Bird Society, which has a membership of 40,000 and a budget this year of $7.5 million. (Japan has a population of 124 million, half that of the United States.) The Wild Bird Society was started in 1934 by a devout Buddhist who promoted bird watching as an esthetic ritual similar to a tea ceremony or flower arranging. In the 1970's, an internal power struggle, fomented by younger leaders with a more Western conservationist bent, resulted in the development of ecology training programs. The society today runs 10 small bird sanctuaries throughout Japan. Although it tries to avoid making political waves, it does a little lobbying on the most important issue for bird protection in Japan: the protection of wetlands from resort and industrial development. \nThree international environmental groups have offices in Tokyo: Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and the Worldwide Fund for Nature. All suffer from chronic underfinancing and shaky morale. \"We have young people who want to come work for us,\" says Jonathan Holliman, director of the Tokyo branch of Friends of the Earth, \"but their parents tell them, 'If you do, you'll leave this house today!' There is a stigma attached to all groups that advocate social change in Japan, and people worry if they work for us that their marriage and job prospects would suffer.\"\nThe lack of a popular understanding of ecological principles accounts in large part for the seeming helplessness of Japanese environmentalist groups. Takashi Adachi, a graphic designer from the city of Gifu, is one of those protesters who joined Reiko Amano in her paddle-raising protests of the Nagara River dam. An outdoorsman, Adachi has formed his own protest group called Save the Satsukimasu, after the name of a fish that the dam may drive extinct. \n\"I heard that Americans were able to stop a dam because of a fish called the snail darter,\" says Adachi, explaining the derivation of his group's name. But instead of focusing on the fish's possible extinction, Adachi stresses that such a demise would put commercial fishermen out of work. He admits that without a law to protect endangered species his efforts are empty gestures. \"My fight is as much a struggle for democracy in Japan as anything else,\" he says, wistfully."}, {"text": "Kuwait City Journal; Foreign Women Lured Into Bondage in Kuwait\n1992-01-03T05:00:00.000Z\nEdita Castro left her home in a Manila slum for Kuwait after hearing a radio commercial promising a good job overseas.\nOut of work, struggling to feed her three children, the 33-year-old mother packed her bags for what she thought would be a two-year stint as a nanny. But when she showed up at the airport she was spirited away in a van to a house in Kuwait City. She would work, she was informed, not as a nanny but a maid.\nMany Kuwaitis, who felt the sting of mistreatment by their Iraqi occupiers, have failed to translate that experience into compassion for the 500,000 menial laborers, most of them from Asia, who do everything from sweep their streets to cook their food. Beaten and Raped\nOnce in her employer's home, Mrs. Castro was refused permission to leave for even a few minutes. She could not receive letters or phone calls, even from her family. Her work began before dawn and ended long after midnight.\nIf she failed to respond fast enough, she was beaten. She was never paid her $130 a month salary. Then, she recounts, she was raped by her employer.\nShe fled to the Philippine Embassy and was given space on the floor of two rooms that now hold 130 women who have sought refuge.\nAnd it is not just the Filipinos who have fled. The Indian, Bangladesh and Sri Lankan embassies say 15 to 20 women a day arrive at their gates with similar reports of abuse. 'Almost Like Slavery'\nForeign workers, and especially domestic servants, complain of beatings, long hours with no time off, tardy payment or nonpayment of salaries, being denied contact with the outside world and sexual abuse.\nMohammed Shabanan, the Assistant Secretary for Labor Affairs, said his office was looking into the activity of the many recruitment agencies that bring the workers into the country, but he refused to comment on charges of mistreatment.\nMir Abdel Hossain, First Secretary of the Bangladesh Embassy, said, \"This job of a houseboy or a maid in Kuwait is almost like slavery.\"\nThe workers have little recourse if they are abused, most being denied protection under the labor laws. They must reimburse their employers for the travel and agency fees, a small fortune for them and their families, if they want to break the contract. And many have already pawned their jewelry or taken out loans to pay the $300 fee charged them by the agencies.\nThe Kuwaiti Government will not issue exit visas to the workers without the employers' consent, even if they can get emergency travel documents from their embassies. Some Are Trapped\nThe workers who fail to raise the $1,500 to cover their employers' costs in bringing them them to Kuwait are often trapped, unable to work and unable to leave. In some cases the women do not even know the phone number and full name or address of the employer they ran away from, sending embassy staff members into neighborhoods to knock on doors.\nThe Philippine, Indian, Bangladesh and Sri Lankan embassies try to find new jobs for those who do not have the money to buy their own release.\n\"You get them a job and a week later they are back with the same stories,\" a labor attache said.\nAbuse of foreign workers is nothing new in the emirate, which has one of the highest standards of living in the world. In 1988 the Phillipine Government banned agencies from recruiting maids for Kuwait, contending that many were abused. The Sri Lankan, Bangladesh and Indian Governments also discourage women from taking jobs in the Persian Gulf countries and especially Kuwait.\nBut Kuwaiti recruitment agencies operate openly and advertise in the newspapers and have branch offices overseas. The agencies skirt the Philippine ban by promising employment in Bahrain or Qatar and sending the women on to Kuwait instead.\nKuwait, with some 600,000 citizens, has long depended on legions of foreign workers to prop up a luxurious and often indolent way of life.\nBefore the Iraqi invasion the country had over 1.5 million foreign workers. Diplomats contend there are probably half a million now, and each week a few hundred are added to their ranks.\nAfter decades of living off huge oil revenues, many Kuwaits do not know how to cook or do simple household chores.\nThe al-Garib complex, a building with several small offices, houses some of the many recruitment agencies in Kuwait City. People needing maids, drivers or houseboys leaf through the files and choose whom they want from one-page resumes that include photos.\n\"It is not like in the United States,\" said a man who identified himself as Youssef in the al-Gatan Trading Company, as he handed over sheets on Filipino and Sri Lankan maids. \"You don't have to give them a schedule or a day off. If you do you will spoil them. Treat them like children.\"\nThe pressure on those trapped inside the embassies is intense. They are unable to support their families back home, who depend on the income from abroad to survive. The women have no privacy and little to occupy their time. Maid's Return Demanded\nCol. Abdel Latif, whose maid, Lourma Sanchez, has taken refuge in the Philippine Embassy, angrily demanded her return from embassy employees.\nThe maid, who contends she was frequently beaten, said the colonel followed and struck her with his car as she tried to flee from the house. The colonel says \"she had an accident trying to escape.\"\nThe officer's angry demands, and refusal to return her passport, sent an embassy employee inside to try and get Mrs. Sanchez to aquiesce.\nMrs. Sanchez, tears streaming down cheeks, instead grabbed a kitchen knife and tried to thrust it into her stomach before being restrained. The embassy employee, as she rocked the woman in her arms, also began to cry.\nThe colonel, when told of the incident, refused to back down.\n\"Do you think I run a travel agency for Filipino girls?\" he asked. \"What about my money? Who is going to pay my money back?\""}, {"text": "THE WORLD; U.S. Forces Find Work As Angels Of Mercy\n1992-01-12T05:00:00.000Z\nFRESH off a triumphant year bracketed by the crushing defeat of Iraq's army and the breakup of its Soviet archrival, the United States military faces a growing role as an international angel of mercy.\nIn the last 12 months, American-led allied forces provided food, water and shelter to 500,000 Kurds in northern Iraq and Turkey. Navy hovercraft ferried tons of supplies and medicine to typhoon-ravaged Bangladesh. An olive-green tent city sprouted at an American naval base in Cuba to house 7,000 Haitians fleeing their country. Perhaps most emblematic of this changing mission, Air Force cargo planes this winter are flying tons of food, blankets and medical supplies into the former Soviet republics.\nThe Bush Administration last week sent former Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard L. Armitage to London, Bonn and Helsinki, Finland, to scout a location to coordinate the flow of Western aid to the newly independent Soviet republics, including $100 million Congress earmarked in this year's $291 billion Defense Department budget to transport supplies.\nThe military has embraced its humanitarian mission with some ambivalence, despite its training to rebuild cities, handle vast medical emergencies and whisk life-saving aid to disaster areas on a few hours' notice. Battle-hardened generals boast of turning their war machines around to help the sick and needy. But they also worry that quick infusions of emergency relief can drag into lengthy and costly commitments.\n\"We're not that excited about staying for the long term, but we have to plan for that eventuality,\" said Marine Brig. Gen. George H. Walls Jr., commander of the military task force at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, that built tent camps for the Haitian boat people in late November and may be running them for weeks or months.\nThe military has conducted relief operations for years, though few on the large scale engaged in last year. But as the Soviet threat fades and the military scrambles to justify its huge budgets, Congress and the Pentagon are focusing the armed forces' sights on new missions: suppression of terrorism and drug trafficking, and humanitarian aid. And in a world where many nations are racked by political unrest and natural calamities, where new impoverished nations are forming in the ashes of the Eastern bloc and where former Soviet clients are willing or eager to accept help from other corners, both Pentagon officials and international relief organizations say the fastest way to rush aid and know-how to a disaster is to send in the Marines. Or the Army, Navy or Air Force.\nAfter the Kurdish relief operation, \"Americans appeared to take it for granted that the U.S. military forces would play a similar role after a cyclone struck Bangladesh and a volcano erupted in the Philippines,\" Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the House Armed Services Committee, said last week.\nThe military's natural ability to operate \"under hostile conditions and adverse circumstances where there is very limited infrastructure\" makes it ideal for disaster relief, said Marine Lieut. Gen. Martin L. Brandtner, director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\nBut while Americans in uniform might form the backbone of future emergency operations, international coalitions that can share costs and ease sensitivities will be needed.\n\"Our strengths are organization, speed and efficiency, but the U.S. can't go it alone any more,\" said Marine Lieut. Gen. Henry C. Stackpole 3d, the American commander of the Bangladesh mission, which relied on help from British, French, Pakistani, Japanese and Bangladeshi forces. 3,000 Tents\nIdeally, commanders want to defuse a crisis and then turn over responsibility to a local government or a relief organization that may have been overwhelmed at first.\nRobert P. DeVecchi, executive director of the International Rescue Committee, one of world's largest private relief agencies, recalled asking an American Army commander in northern Iraq how many weeks it would take to set up 3,000 tents for 15,000 Kurds. By nightfall, six C-130 cargo planes had parachuted the tents and Army engineers had erected them. While the engineers had scores of bulldozers, cranes and helicopters, Mr. DeVecchi said, \"my agency's motor pool was a rented 10-year-old Turkish Land Rover and a stolen Iraqi taxi that had to be hot-wired.\"\nAnd once the military has taken command of a crisis, a graceful exit is not always easy. Last week, months after most American forces left northern Iraq, Army helicopters flew 12 tons of food over snow-blocked mountain roads to Kurdish settlements that United Nations trucks could not reach. This week, as the Haitian refugees await Federal court rulings, Army linguists plan to open a school for 300 children in the camps.\nAnd despite interservice rivalries in the Pentagon, relief work in the field depends on blends of specialized skills from each service.\nAt Guantanamo Bay, for example, Army civil affairs specialists and military police run the camps. Navy doctors provide medical care. The Air Force set up tents for the 1,800 Americans. Marine engineers built the refugees' tent city.\nPolitical sensitivities limit such operations, and the cost runs into the millions quickly.\n\"We don't seek the mission,\" said General Brandtner. \"But relief operations can be expected to be something we'd be involved with from time to time as situations warrant.\""}, {"text": "Tax.

George Bush has repeatedly told the American people that by his standard for judging what taxes or fees are, he raised them only once, and Bill Clinton raised them 128 times. If that is not a lie, then it is its identical twin.\nThe truth is that by George Bush's own standard, he raised taxes and fees 178 times in only three and a half years. That means by George Bush's own standard, he raised taxes and fees 51 times a year -- almost five times more per year than what he claims Bill Clinton did.\nYet, George Bush says he raised taxes and fees only once and his opponent raised them 128 times.

Seeks Blocked Funds to Use in Iraq\n1992-03-04T05:00:00.000Z\nThe United States and the other four permanent members of the Security Council are considering using Iraqi assets frozen abroad to pay for humanitarian supplies and the destruction of Baghdad's most dangerous weapons, and to start compensating victims of its invasion of Kuwait, diplomats said today.\nIraq's assets abroad are thought to total about $5 billion. The amount in the United States is about $500 million, according to recent Congressional testimony by the Bush Administration.\nThe Council has already asked Iraq to resume selling oil, its major export, under the terms of the cease-fire that ended the Persian Gulf war. The terms require that the money be handed over to the United Nations, which would then spend it on food and medicine, the elimination of Iraqi weapons and reparations to Kuwait and to individuals who suffered losses as a result of the Iraqi invasion and occupation. Stubborn Over Oil\nIraq has returned some of the property it plundered from Kuwait, but so far has refused to sell its oil, despite evidence of mounting hardship in Iraq. The Government says it will not compromise its sovereignty by having the United Nations dictate how Iraqi money is spent.\nBecause Iraq has refused to sell oil, the fund set up to pay compensation claims against Iraq remains empty.\nThe United States has suggested that priority go to compensating poor foreign workers who lost their savings as a result of the invasion, since this would provide a useful injection of hard currency into countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Egypt, which are heavily dependent on remittances from citizens working abroad. Stubborn Over Weapons, Too\nIraq is also refusing to cooperate with United Nations efforts to identify and destroy its most dangerous weapons, and is defying international pressure to end an economic blockade against the Kurdish region of northern Iraq.\nBritain and France are urging the council to send an envoy to Iraq to persuade the authorities to lift the trade blockade on the Kurdish region and to end military harassment of Shiite Muslims in the south.\nDeputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz is expected to meet with the Security Council here on March 11 to explain why Iraq is refusing to destroy ballistic missile equipment and to provide further details of its armament plans. 3 Ways to Spend Money\nDiplomats say the United States has proposed three ways to use Iraq's frozen assets.\nThe first would be a Security Council order directing that the $1.5 billion worth of Iraqi oil in transit when the international embargo against Iraq was imposed be put under United Nations control. These assets, in the form of oil and delayed oil payments, has already been earmarked by the Council for compensation payments and humanitarian aid.\nAnother option, officials say, would be a resolution directing the Bank for International Settlements to hand over more than $300 million that Iraq keeps there. This cash is a deposit from which the bank settles other countries' trade accounts with Iraq.\nFinally, the Security Council could order or encourage countries to unblock Iraq bank deposits and other financial assets, including shares held in companies.\nThe Security Council committee overseeing sanctions against Iraq has already said that governments may unfreeze such funds at their discretion, provided they use the money to sent humanitarian goods to Iraq. But the United States and the 12 European Community countries agreed not to do so in order to encourage Baghdad to accept the oil-sales plan.\nWhile major governments agreed to freeze what Iraqi assets they could find, experts say Baghdad still has access to secret funds abroad that are being used to pay for some imports of food and other goods. But no one knows how much is involved."}, {"text": "Women's Work\n1992-03-02T05:00:00.000Z\nThere was an air of gimmickry about a gathering in Geneva last week of 70 wives of top government leaders. But the purpose was a good one: to draw attention to the appalling lot of rural women in the poorest, most populous countries.\nThough more females are born than males, a 1991 census in India found 92.9 females for every 100 males in the population. In China: 93.8 females for every 100 males.\nWhat happened to the missing women? Many were routinely killed, others starved because priority is given to feeding males -- the fate of as many as 100 million missing women in the world.\nRural women who survive are expected to do far more than take care of children and the home. They are also the dirt farmers and tenders of livestock: in the words of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, \"the unacknowledged backbone of the rural economy.\"\nIn Bangladesh, the innovative Grameen Bank has extended a million small loans -- 92 percent of the borrowers were women who used the loans to increase food production and improve homes. The women's repayment rate has been 97 percent.\nRaising the status of women is the key to greater food output, better health care and increased literacy in developing countries. By signing the Geneva Declaration for Rural Women, 70 First Ladies called welcome attention to the world's hardest and least-recognized workers. It is a pity that Barbara Bush and most other Western First Ladies failed to attend."}, {"text": "India Plans Purchases Of Wheat\n1992-02-13T05:00:00.000Z\nFor the first time since 1988, the Government of India will be buying wheat abroad to bolster its stockpiles of food, Indian and American officials say.\nThe head of India's Food Deaprtment told the United States Agriculture Department this week that New Delhi needs about one million tons of grain to stabilize food prices, which have risen as a result of changes in economic policies.\nIn looking for foreign wheat supplies, India is in competition with a number of nations that were once part of the former Soviet Union. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome said today that 12 former Soviet republics, excluding the Baltic nations, might buy as much as 35 million tons of grain this year, 11 million more than last year.\nWorldwide, the food organization said, the demand for wheat alone would increase 12 million tons.\nAmerican officials say there is less fear in Washington that supplies will be strained and more concern that subsidized European grain will siphon off buyers. American wheat sells for about $180 a ton; wheat grown in Europe under heavy European Community subsidies sells for $130 a ton.\nIndia, which is self-sufficient in food production, bought two million tons of American wheat in 1988 when food stockpiles were running low. The wheat was sold under the 1985 Export Enhancement Program, which subsidizes sales of American grain to make it more competitive with European grain.\nNew Delhi has asked the United States for price concessions again this year. In the Agriculture Department, officials are inclined to support the Indian request because India, with about 850 million people and a limited ability to expand acreage, is seen as a long-term cash customer for American wheat.\nRussia is seeking about 23 million tons on the world market this year, officials say. But they believe that private ownership and improvements in Russian agriculture will sooner or later make production more efficient.\nThe United States has made other poor South Asian nations, including Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, eligible for the Export Enhancement Program subsidies on grain. Asian nations with better economic performances and large trade imbalances with the United States have been excluded. These include Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, all of which continue to buy American wheat rather than cheaper European grain."}, {"text": "WITH U.N.'S HELP, U.S. WILL AIRLIFT FOOD TO SOMALIA\n1992-08-15T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Pentagon will begin a special airlift of food to Somalia as soon as possible, the White House announced tonight.\nAn Administration official said the step was intended to speed the shipment of food to outlying areas of the country that have received little food in the last several months because of warfare and drought.\nThe officials said the airlift would begin in the next several days and would be directed at areas where planes will not be challenged by armed bands that have thwarted the delivery of supplies of food in recent months. Kenya Involved, as Well\nMarlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said, \"We are asking the Kenyan Government to join us in supporting airlifts to northern Kenya for Somali refugees and drought-stricken Kenyans, and to locations inside Somalia where there is sufficient security to support these relief operations.\"\nThe Red Cross has estimated that a third of the eastern African nation's population, variously estimated at 4.5 million to 6 million, is in danger of starving to death. Worsening matters, the fighting has blocked food deliveries and destroyed any semblance of government in Somalia since the longtime dictator Mohammed Siad Barre was overthrown early in 1991.\nMore than two million Somalis have been pushed off their land by warring factions, preventing farmers from planting crops. Much of their livestock has been killed.\nThe White House's announcement tonight follows a recent agreement between the United Nations and a Somali factional leader that will allow the deployment of 500 armed United Nations troops to guard the food deliveries. A Protracted Operation\nThe United States is likely to fly those guards to Somalia, an American official said. Relief officials in the country say they expect the guards to arrive, at the earliest, in three weeks.\nThe Bush Administration also said it would seek a United Nations Security Council resolution that would authorize the sending of the armed guards, as well as any additional ones that might be needed. The White House said it wants the Security Council to adopt a resolution that would \"authorize use of additional measures to insure that humanitarian relief can be delivered.\"\nHelp for Somalia has been a priority for the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali of Egypt, who has compared the intense Western interest in the fighting in the former Yugoslav republics with the West's limited interest in the far more desperate plight of the Somalis.\nThe United States, joining the effort to prevent starvation in Somalia, has donated $77 million in food. The Administration said today that it had ordered that an additional 145,000 tons of food be sent. Its cost is not known.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross has delivered 88,000 tons of food to Somalia this year, and the United Nations has sent 22,000 tons, according to officials of the two organizations. Gregoire Tavernier, the International Red Cross official in charge of Somalia operations, says the nation's capital, Mogadishu, with a population of about a million, needs 15,000 to 20,000 tons in food aid a month. But the main problem is in distributing the aid amid the perils of war.\n\"Because armed bands are stealing and hoarding food as well as attacking international relief workers,\" Mr. Fitzwater said, \"the primary challenge that the international community faces is the delivery of relief supplies.\"\nThe airlift will allow the delivery of food to southern and central Somalia, officials say, pending the arrival of the guards, who are to protect the movement of the food shipments to the rural areas where they are most needed.\nThe American military has been used on previous occasions to deliver relief supplies. Soon after the Persian Gulf war, it brought food and clothing to areas of Bangladesh that had been devastated by a cyclone.\nThe aid was delivered by a task force that was diverted to Bangladesh on its way home from the gulf. The task force delivered 3,300 tons of supplies to coastal areas and islands, using ships, helicopters and amphibious craft.\nThe United States also mounted a major effort to deliver relief to Armenia after the earthquake there in 1988.\nAdministration officials said the military authorities in charge of the Somalia airlift had received little advance notice that it was being ordered before the announcement tonight. Little Information at Pentagon\nPentagon spokesmen said they could not say when the operation would begin, how long it would last, or how many planes would be involved. Much of the airlift, an American official said, would involve transporting the supplies from Kenya to Somalia.\nThe Administration's decision to send the aid was issued with a written statement. It was made in such haste that key elements of the airlift are still being planned.\n\"We are working the details of the operation now,\" a Pentagon spokesman said. \"We don't have any information.\"\nAn Administration official said it was decided to launch the airlift after experts determined that there were areas where supplies could be transported without the need for special security measures. In addition to beginning the airlift, the White House said it was proposing that the United Nations convene a conference among aid donors on the Somalia crisis.\n\"The President calls upon other nations to join us in this urgent and important effort to alleviate starvation in Somalia,\" Mr. Fitzwater said.\nMajor factions in the Somalia fighting would also be invited to the session, the White House said. The cooperation of the Somali factions, Mr. Fitzwater said, would represent \"the most important step to accelerate delivery of relief supplies and to minimize security problems.\"\nThis week, Gen. Mohammed Farrah Aidid, the leader of one of the two main, clan-based factions that have been fighting in Somalia for the last 10 months, agreed to the deployment of the 500 United Nations guards.\nA United Nations representative visited General Aidid this week at his headquarters at Bardera, 185 miles west of Mogadishu. The general signed a document saying the troops would protect the Mogadishu port and transportation to rural centers where hundreds of people are dying each day.\nGeneral Aidid's opponent, Mohammed Ali Mahdi, has long welcomed the idea of the United Nations troops. But Mr. Mahdi has consistently opposed the idea of opening the port of Mogadishu to commercial shipping, saying that his adversary would use the opportunity to get shipments of weapons."}, {"text": "Finally, Help for Somalia\n1992-08-18T05:00:00.000Z\nHigh marks to President Bush, and to whoever nudged his pen, for ordering the Pentagon to airlift food to millions of starving people in Somalia. What one U.S. aid official calls \"the world's worst humanitarian disaster\" has been caused by devastating drought and a senseless clan war that forced two million farmers from the land. Besides the airlift, Washington will fly in 500 armed United Nations guards and seek a Security Council resolution authorizing \"additional measures\" to assure arrival of humanitarian relief.\nThe Bush Administration should have done this months ago. Distribution has been the main problem in getting food aid to the interior and to the capital, Mogadishu, the scene of savage street warfare. Human rights groups charge that the U.S. was dragging its feet, fearful of an election-year quagmire in the Horn of Africa; the Administration says it has long been ready to move but was waiting for the U.N. to take the lead.\nWhatever the case, urgently needed aid is now en route, and Somalia's capricious warlords will have to contend with U.N. guards and the U.S. Air Force. Nobody pretends to have pat solutions for the chaos that followed the ouster in 1991 of Somalia's longtime dictator, Mohammed Siad Barre. But to say that nothing could be done, that Somalia was too messy and remote, would have been a shameful, unthinkable abdication.\nThe new measures should sober belligerents and begin to comfort the afflicted. After similar humanitarian missions in Kurdish Iraq and Bangladesh, the U.S. armed forces will gain precious experience in what may be an increasingly needful role. Even in this political season, Mr. Bush warrants bipartisan applause for his Somalia mission."}, {"text": "Humanity Confronts Its Handiwork: An Altered Planet\n1992-05-05T05:00:00.000Z\nHUMANS have always exploited nature in the belief that the all-encompassing biosphere -- the seamless, wondrously resilient fabric of life, land, water and air -- was so vast and enduring that people could never do it basic harm.\nEvents of the last decade have shattered that comforting perception. The moment of awakening may have come in the mid-1980's when governments finally accepted and acted on the evidence that waste industrial chemicals were weakening the stratospheric ozone shield that protects living things from biologically harmful ultraviolet rays.\nBut that is almost the least of it. People have now transformed the biosphere on so many fronts, scientists say, that Homo sapiens rivals grand forces like the movement of continents, volcanic eruptions, asteroid impacts and ice ages as an agent of global change.\nThe transformation has sharply escalated in both scale and pace since World War II. And it is raising serious questions not only about the ability of nature to sustain the global economy, but also about the health and future of the biosphere itself. That is why delegates from around the world are preparing to gather at an \"Earth Summit\" early next month in Rio de Janeiro.\nThere are many reasons for concern:\n*People have transformed or manipulated ecosystems constituting about half the planet's ice-free land surface and have made a significant impact on most of the rest.\n*They have appropriated to their own use about 40 percent of the photosynthetic energy produced by plants.\n*They have steadily reduced the number of other species in the world through pollution, hunting and destruction of natural habitat. Now, as the inroads become deeper and more widespread, many biologists fear that human activity could bring about a mass extinction of epic scale, wiping out 25 percent of the world's remaining species in the next 50 years.\n*By burning coal, oil, natural gas and trees they cut down, humans have altered the global flow of energy within the biosphere. Atmospheric concentrations of heat-trapping carbon dioxide have increased by 25 percent since pre-industrial times. That is well above levels recorded at any other time in the last 160,000 years, which is as far back as scientists have been able to track the trend. No end to the buildup is in sight. If it remains uncontrolled, scientists warn, a disruptive and possibly catastrophic warming of the earth could take place.\n*Global population, which stood at 2.5 billion only 40 years ago, is expected to reach 6 billion by the year 2000 and swell to perhaps 10 billion 60 years from now.\nDelegates to Rio hope to sign legally binding treaties to cope with the threats of climate change and species extinction. The final round of talks on climate is to conclude at the United Nations in New York this week. The last round of biodiversity talks starts next week in Nairobi, Kenya.\nThe Rio delegates also hope to adopt a statement of principles and an agenda for action to prevent broad damage to the biosphere while accommodating the economic needs of the surging population.\nThe question of limits to economic and population growth has come to the fore once again in connection with the summit. But this time it has been joined by the newer and more pressing question of the degree to which the biosphere is in jeopardy. Scientists are still struggling toward an answer in each case.\nUntil now, humans have always been able to push back the physical limits imposed on their expansion by the rest of the biosphere. When limited food supplies have threatened to check the proliferation of people, for instance, people have employed technology and social organization to grow crops and then clear forests, plow grasslands and, finally, harness science to agriculture. Humanity has not repealed the laws of ecology, but it has bent them; it continually expands to fill its ecological niche, then stretches the niche -- at some cost to other elements of the biosphere. Capacity for Growth\nIs the capacity of the earth to accommodate human growth infinite?\nNo, argue Donella H. Meadows, Dennis L. Meadows and Jorgen Randers, three authors of the \"limits to growth\" thesis propounded 20 years ago under the sponsorship of the Club of Rome, an informal group of academics, civil servants and business leaders. The thesis, based on computerized simulations of the workings of the global ecosystem, held that limits to growth on the planet would be breached within a century and that a sudden and uncontrollable decline of population and industrial capacity would ensue. Damage to the biosphere's natural resources were one element in the predicted collapse.\nIn a new book called \"Beyond the Limits\" (Chelsea Green Publishing Co.), based partly on updated computer simulations, the three authors argue that if human activity continues as at present, it will \"overshoot\" the carrying capacity of the biosphere and precipitate a collapse within the next few decades.\nThe result, they write, would be \"a permanently impoverished environment and a material standard of living much lower than could have been possible had the environment never been overstressed.\"\nThe new analysis puts more emphasis on deterioration of the biosphere, and Dennis Meadows said that it convinced him that less time is available to halt the expected collapse than had earlier been thought. Twenty years ago, he said, \"it seemed to us there was a period out to 2030 or 2040 in which to fashion a sustainable society.\" Now, he said, it looks as if a new set of attitudes and policies are not in place in the next 20 years, it will be too late to avoid an eventual collapse. Are Limits Real?\nThe original limits-to-growth thesis drew sharp criticism and dissent, and the updated one is likely to provoke argument as well. Indeed, Allen Sinai, chief executive officer of the Boston Company Economic Advisors, an economic analysis group, took issue with its forecast of overshoot-and-collapse in a debate on the subject a few weeks ago in Cambridge, Mass. The debate was organized by Earthwatch, a Boston-based scientific research and education organization. The earth's carrying capacity is \"roughly infinite over the time span of relevance to most of us, which would be 50 to a hundred to 150 years,\" Dr. Sinai said.\nHe did not discount \"the very real effects\" of population and economic growth on the physical world in the short term. But \"again and again,\" he said, the market system has \"stretched limits which appear finite to roughly infinite,\" frustrating Malthusian predictions of disaster.\nBut no one knows the capacity of the biosphere to sustain humanity's expansion. \"We have yet to see a cogent analysis of what the real, sustainable carrying capacity of the earth is for people,\" said Dr. Daniel Botkin, an ecologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara.\nScholars have a better fix on the ways in which human activity is transforming the biosphere, even though they have only recently begun looking at the question systematically. No Immediate Danger\nContrary to widespread popular perception, they say, the earth itself is in no danger at the hands of humanity, and life itself is not about to be wiped out. Grand movements of the continents, shifts in the earth's position relative to the sun that bring on ice ages, global temperatures higher than any contemplated in the foreseeable future, bombardment of the planet by debris from space -- all have transformed the earth in the past without destroying the planet or extinguishing all life.\nNor are humans the only species that has altered the biosphere. The earth's original atmosphere, for instance, was far different from today's. But about 2 billion years ago, photosynthesizing microbes that lived on hydrogen began to break down water and expel oxygen as a byproduct. Oxygen was toxic to most other organisms then alive, and they perished as atmospheric oxygen built up. The ultimate result was the creation of a new, oxygen-rich atmosphere that supports today's animal kingdom.\nNevertheless, the extent of change wrought by humans \"is enormous; you can't get away from it,\" said Dr. B. L. Turner 2d, a geographer at Clark University in Worcester, Mass., who directs a new program based at Clark on human transformation of the earth. The most recent and comprehensive inventory of biospheric changes caused by humans was published in 1990 under the auspices of Clark. In it, a wide range of experts in the physical and social sciences from around the world described the last 300 years of change.\n\"Humankind has altered or transformed virtually every element of the biosphere,\" Dr. Turner, Dr. Robert W. Kates of Brown University and Dr. William C. Clark of Harvard University wrote in the first chapter of the voluminous report, \"The Earth as Transformed by Human Action\" (Cambridge University Press, 1990).\nThe face of the earth, the 1990 report said, bears the most visible and oldest marks of change, although the more recent and more subtle changes in the flows of the biosphere's energy and chemicals may be more profound.\nAlterations to the face of the earth have been going on \"a bit longer than most people realize,\" Dr. Turner said. For instance, one quarter of the deforestation that has now taken place in the world had taken place by 1700, and 75 percent by 1915.\nBut in most cases, at least half the biospheric change caused by humans has taken place since World War II. This is especially true of the byproducts of the consumption-oriented industrial societies: emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, chlorofluorocarbons that weaken the protective ozone layer, nitrates that alter patterns of plant growth and sulfates that cause heat-reflecting clouds to form and acid to pollute water and soil.\nSome changes analyzed in the study are decelerating even while others speed up. Humans increasingly alter the distribution of water in the biosphere by withdrawing more and more of it for their own use, for instance, and carbon dioxide continues to build up in the air. But some changes are decelerating because awareness of harmful impacts has led to regulation. One example is the successful effort to reduce emissions of lead, sulfur and carbon tetrachloride. Now that the world has formally agreed to phase out the manufacture of ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons, they are expected in time to diminish as a problem.\nMoreover, the global pattern of biospheric transformation is uneven. Much land in the industrialized countries has reverted to forest, for example, as those countries have moved toward zero population growth and the area devoted to farming has declined. But in the developing countries, where population is surging and industrialization is only now taking hold, forests are being cleared at an increasingly rapid rate to provide both farmland and lumber.\nThe effects of the changes are also expected to vary regionally, with winners and losers emerging. If the human population were ever to plunge sharply because there were no longer enough resources to sustain it, \"you wouldn't see a global crash,\" Dr. Botkin said. \"You'd see it in one region or another.\" The Clark study warns that \"regional population declines are possible, potentially brutal and even likely accompaniments\" to the achievement of zero population growth globally.\nSimilarly, some cold regions might benefit, or suffer less, from global warming while others would suffer catastrophic drought or flooding from rising sea levels. Developing countries would be hardest hit in both instances, experts believe.\nWhat of the future?\nDemographers do not expect the global population to stabilize until it reaches 11 billion to 12 billion more than a century from now, and even this projection assumes that fertility rates eventually stabilize at replacement level -- an insecure assumption. Some analysts say the increase would be accompanied by a tripling or quadrupling of agricultural production and a sixfold to eightfold increase in energy use. Dr. Turner and his colleagues say that this analysis suggests that \"the enormous transformations of the last three centuries will be doubled, trebled or more in the centuries to come.\"\nBut surprises are virtually assured.\n\"The very best scientists of any time,\" they wrote, \"may only poorly understand the fundamental processes governing nature, society and the relationships between them.\"\nAnd even if fears about the biosphere's health are genuine, they said, \"the gloomiest of forecasts may not be realized because society takes them seriously and acts upon them.\" POPULATION Pressure Is Building\nTHROUGHOUT most of history, humans have been a quite minor presence on the planet. Only 200 million people were alive at the time of the birth of Christ. By the time Europeans first settled in America 1,600 years later, the world population had grown to 500 million. But the human population spurted to 1 billion in 1850, more than doubled by 1950 and then more than doubled again, to 5.3 billion, in just the next 40 years. This post-Industrial Revolution expansion -- and especially the last 50 years -- is generally held responsible for most of the stress humans have put on the biosphere.\nDemographers say that though women have been having fewer children since 1950, improved health and control of disease have caused death rates to plummet, so that global population increased. At the same time, population growth feeds on itself: more people means more women of childbearing age.\nThe United Nations now projects that if fertility ultimately stabilizes at a replacement rate of about 2.06 births per woman, the global population will reach 10 billion in the year 2050 before leveling off and stabilizing at around 11.5 billion soon after 2200. But those numbers could vary greatly if fertility rates turn out to be higher or lower. At a rate of 2.5 births per woman, the U.N. calculates, world population would reach 28 billion in 2150. At a rate of 1.7, which a few industrialized countries have achieved, it would reach 7.8 billion in 2050 but then fall to 4.3 billion a century later. Economics and Population\nAccording to conventional wisdom, a country's population will stabilize as its economy develops and living standards rise. This \"demographic shift,\" as it is called, has already taken place in industrialized countries, where the fertility rate is generally at or below replacement level.\nBut the shift is only starting in developing countries of the Southern Hemisphere, where fertility rates, while dropping in many instances, are still double and even triple those in the affluent countries of the North. As a result, the developing countries in 1990 accounted for 77 percent of the global population; by 2025, they are expected to account for about 85 percent. The U.N. projects that more than 60 percent of these will be urban dwellers, as compared with 37 percent in 1990.\nBecause the rural dwellers of developing countries rely for their direct sustenance largely on ready-at-hand renewable resources like trees, soil and water, growing population puts increasing pressure on the local biosphere. Forests are cut for wood, soil is depleted, water is withdrawn at ever-rising rates. In an anxious quest for income, many of these countries are also cutting some of their forests for commercial sale.\nPerhaps a billion people remain desperately poor in these circumstances of mismatched resources and population, slowing the onset of the demographic shift. Many of these are moving to increasingly overcrowded and misery-racked cities in their search for sustenance. AGRICULTURE Revolution Has Slowed\nTEN thousand years ago in the Middle East, humans first freed themselves from dependence on what they could glean from the wild. By cultivating grains for the first time, they were able to expand food supplies so that an unprecedented growth in population was made possible.\nFor millennia, farmers sustained population growth mainly by clearing and cultivating new lands. The clearing escalated about three centuries ago, and since then there has been a 450 percent increase in the world's cultivated acreage, from a total area equivalent to Argentina to an expanse as large as South America.\nAlmost all prime agricultural land is now under cultivation. And although forests are being cleared at a rapid rate, scientists say, the land now being freed for farming is of marginal productivity and will have relatively little impact on future food production.\nMoreover, since World War II, agriculture, deforestation and overgrazing have left an area about the size of China and India combined with moderately to severely diminished soil quality, reducing overall productivity.\nThe Green Revolution, based on higher-yield seeds and fertilizer, largely overcame these limitations starting in the 1960's and 1970's, enabling the world's farmers to sustain the doubling of the global population that began after World War II.\nHigh-yield strains of wheat and rice bred in the world's agricultural laboratories doubled and tripled harvests in much of the developing world. So abundant did the harvests become that world food prices declined by more than 20 percent in the 1980's.\nSub-Saharan Africa is the main exception to the rule. It is the only region in the world with declining food production. It relies most heavily on imported food and a higher proportion of its people are malnourished than for any other region.\nBut out-and-out famine as a result of underproduction has largely disappeared. World hunger today is caused mostly by political upheaval, ineffective distribution of food and inability of the poor to buy it.\nYet the demand for basic food grains could double by 2020, and the ability of agriculture to keep pace with the demand is being called into question. Some neo-Malthusians insist that mass starvation is on the horizon, while some economists counter that human ingenuity will come through as it always has.\nEven some who have brought the Green Revolution about, however, acknowledge that it has made its biggest and easiest gains, and that the challenge ahead appears formidable. Side Effects of Production\n\"The task will not be an easy one,\" said Dr. Donald L. Winkelmann, the director-general of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in Mexico, where the Green Revolution's \"miracle wheat\" was developed. The Green Revolution has entered a new and slower phase, he said, one in which increased production will depend on relatively simple measures like more intensive use of fertilizers, more efficient water use and fast-maturing varieties of plants that allow multiple crops.\nIntensive use of synthetic chemicals runs the risk of further polluting water supplies through runoff, and a number of advocates urge the adoption of alternative methods of cultivation that rely on organic fertilizers and natural pest controls. But alternative agriculture is making inroads slowly.\nMany scientists say that a variety of highly productive new strains of crops might be developed, but there are widespread fears that the natural genetic material from which they might be created is rapidly disappearing.\nFarmers, as they embrace the Green Revolution, are abandoning traditional crop strains that constitute part of this genetic capital. And the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization warned recently that global agriculture could be threatened by the extinction of 40,000 important plant species in the next 60 years unless conservation measures are immediately stepped up. SPECIES The Signs Of Danger\nIN THE last 600 million years, the earth has experienced five big extinctions of life, usually linked to climatic change, in which 35 percent to 95 percent of all species then on the planet disappeared. Scientists know from fossil records that in each case it took 10 million years or more for the earth to regain its biological diversity.\nHumans may now be precipitating an extinction of comparable scale, many biologists fear. Some economists argue that the fears are based on insubstantial evidence, and a few biologists say they may be exaggerated. But most biologists who have studied the situation believe the threat to species diversity is a clear and present danger.\nAs people alter or obliterate natural ecosystems to plant crops, harvest trees and build cities and towns, they destroy species habitat. Eventually a species that lives in a given kind of habitat will be doomed to extinction if enough patches of habitat disappear.\nGlobe-traveling humans have also introduced countless species into new habitats around the world, where they tend to choke out native species. Few areas on earth have been unaffected by this redistribution of plants and animals. Many animals have already been hunted to extinction. Others, like the rhinoceros and the African elephant, are threatened by hunting today. The Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Pacific and Indian Oceans are so heavily fished that fish populations can no longer withstand the pressure, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization says, and pressure is nearly as heavy in some other oceanic areas. Diversity of Life\nNo one can say for sure how many species are being doomed. But Dr. E. O. Wilson, a Harvard University biologist, has determined on the basis of field observations that when a patch of habitat is reduced by 90 percent, the number of species living in it eventually declines by about half. Using this formula, Dr. Wilson has calculated that at the rate at which tropical rain forests are being destroyed, 10 percent to 22 percent of rain forest species will be lost in the next 30 years because of habitat destruction alone.\nThe rain forests contain about half the plants, animals and microbes on earth. A quarter or more of the planet's species could be eliminated in 50 years, Dr. Wilson said.\nHow many species this amounts to is unknown, for the simple reason that the vast majority of all living species have yet to be discovered. About 1.4 million have been named, but biologists say there may be as many as 10 million, or even 100 million undiscovered species. The overwhelming majority are not charismatic species like elephants and whales but obscure but essential invertebrates and microbes that undergird the web of life. \"The life of this planet,\" Dr. Wilson said, \"is largely unexplored.\" If he and others are right, much of life could vanish before scientists can even name it.\nWhat does it matter?\nApart from the value attached to life in general, natural ecosystems provide the materials of human sustenance That is where crops originally came from. Forests contain untapped riches in the form of medicines. But more than that, scientists say, natural ecosystems are such an essential part of the biosphere that mass extinctions could undermine its functioning. It is now widely recognized, for instance, that the diversity of life interacts with the oceans and the atmosphere in regulating climate, that it is essential in creating soils and holding them in place, that it cleanses waters of pollution and maintains a microbial standoff that keeps harmful pathogens under control.\nScientists do not know at what point a gradual loss of species results in the disintegration of ecosystems, or at what point the loss of ecosystems begins to affect the overall health of the biosphere. But many argue that it is dangerous to take chances. FOREST Chain-Saw Progress\nOF ALL the differences humans have made in the face of the Earth, perhaps none is so striking as the disappearance of forests. People have long been cutting down trees, but only in recent decades have they become alarmed at the scope and rate of deforestation.\nTrees play a vital role in the maintenance of the biosphere. They hold soil in place, preventing erosion and the silting of rivers. They absorb water and give off moisture, helping to recycle water. They absorb vast amounts of heat-trapping carbon dioxide and lock it up in their cells. And they contain a disproportionate share of the world's living species.\nEstimating the extent of forest cover and of deforestation is chancy, since many forests regenerate and are in constant flux.\nIn fact, deforestation of temperate-zone forests in the industrialized countries has reversed in this century as marginal farm land is taken out of production and trees reclaim it. There were an estimated 7.7 million square miles of forest in the developed nations in 1900, and about 8 million in 1985. Pressure on Forests\nBut the population explosion in the developing countries has intensified the pressure on forests there, which are one of the last sources of fuel and of new pasture and arable land, however marginal. The advent of the chain saw, truck and tractor have made it immeasurably easier to clear trees. As a result, according to United Nations estimates, an area of tropical forest larger than the state of Florida is disappearing each year.\nScientists estimate that about half the forest cover of the developing world has vanished in this century, and the rate of tropical deforestation is believed to have increased by 50 percent in the 1980's.\nWorldwide, scientists say, there has been a net loss of more than 3 million square miles of forest, an area roughly equal to the 48 contiguous states of the United States. About half the loss has come since 1850. Figures on deforestation vary somewhat, but experts agree that trees are being destroyed on a large scale, and many believe the rate in the tropics is accelerating.\nAssuming that about 3 million square miles of forest have been lost, that would be 12 to 13 percent of the pre-agricultural worldwide total. Forests may therefore cover an area 85 to 90 percent as large as they did 10,000 years ago. Scientists nevertheless raise two main alarms.\nFirst, some 25 percent of the heat-trapping carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere as a result of human activity has come from deforestation. While the burning of fossil fuels will continue to be the main source of carbon dioxide buildup, accelerating deforestation adds substantially to the atmospheric total.\nSecond, the tropical forests -- which happen to be in the very developing countries where population pressures are greatest -- harbor far more living species per acre than forests elsewhere. Their density, complexity and fertility allow many habitats to coexist in a small area, and the loss of even a tiny patch can doom numerous species. WATER Few Drops To Spare\nAS POPULATION expands and economies develop, humans are pressing the world's freshwater resources hard, and some regions are starting to bump up against limits imposed by water supplies.\nOnly 3 percent of the water on earth is fresh. Most of that is locked up in ice caps and glaciers. If all the water in the world amounted to 25 gallons, about half a teaspoon would be available for human use.\nAgainst this background of limitations, human use is 35 times what it was three centuries ago. People withdraw the equivalent of Lake Huron from the world's rivers, streams, lakes and aquifers each year, and withdrawals have been increasing by about 4 to 8 percent a year in recent decades. About 40 percent of the water withdrawn is returned quickly to the water cycle as waste water. The rest is consumed.\nAbout two-thirds of the withdrawals are used for agriculture, about 25 percent for industrial use and the rest for domestic purposes. Experts expect withdrawals for farming to increase slightly by the end of this century and withdrawals for industrial use to double. Most of the increase will be in the developing countries. Water use is stabilizing in the industrialized countries and is actually expected to decline slightly in the 1990's. Water Supply Problems\nThe vagaries of rainfall make the distribution of water uneven related to human need. Water is chronically short in many areas of sub-Saharan Africa, threatening the ability of agriculture to keep up with population. Supplies of water are beginning to fall behind demand in northern China, and the World Resources Institute says shortages could reach crisis proportions in the Middle East before this decade is out. Shortages have become a familiar and serious problem in the southwestern United States, particularly in California.\nIn their thirst, humans have greatly altered the distribution and quality of fresh water on the planet, most of which is found in river basins. They have submerged an area the size of France in reservoirs, disrupting the flow of rivers and transforming their ecosystems. They have polluted more than enough river water to fill Lake Superior. And typically, they have caused the amount of choking sediments to triple in large rivers and to increase eightfold in smaller ones in crowded regions.\nThe World Resources Institute says that in general, river water quality as measured by the biological demand for oxygen has improved in industrialized countries over the last 20 years because of better sewage treatment.\nIn the developing world, water quality is difficult to determine with precision because of a lack of information. But there appears little doubt that it is deteriorating there, especially around urban areas. Industrial discharges are usually poorly controlled, according to the World Resources Institute, and few cities in the developing countries treat their sewage.\nBoth pollution and development have had a heavy impact on many river ecosystems, and the rivers also carry pollution to coastal areas, where they affect coral reefs and the breeding grounds of marine life. ATMOSPHERE Potential Disaster\nGLOBAL warming is the most far-reaching transformation wrought by humans because it could catastrophically magnify other changes as well -- if it develops as many scientists fear.\nAtmospheric levels of some gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, mainly carbon dioxide and methane, are rising steadily as a result of human activity like the burning of fossil fuels. But scientists agree on little else beyond that.\nThey have not yet fully understood the myriad atmospheric interactions that are touched off when these \"greenhouse\" gases trap heat. The ultimate heating depends on the degree to which these interactions cancel each other out. But with that caveat, an international group of scientists convened by the United Nations predicts that if humans continue to pour greenhouse gases into the air at the present rate, the average surface temperature of the globe will rise by 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit some time in the next century. In comparison, the average temperature of the earth has risen by 9 degrees since the depths of the last ice age.\nWhether a human-induced warming has already begun is unclear. The 1980's were an unusually warm decade, and 1990 and 1991 were the warmest years recorded, globally, since surface-temperature records have been kept. As provocative as this change is, it falls well within the natural swings of climate variability.\nWarming, at least in the lower range of the prediction, could well benefit some people, scientists say. Higher concentrations of carbon dioxide, for example, stimulate crop growth. Some areas of the world would probably receive increased rainfall, making them more fertile. Some would enjoy longer growing seasons in regions where it is now too cold for maximum farm production. The cities of the industrialized North would experience a more salubrious winter climate, while still able to insulate themselves from summer's heat.\nBut there is also a long list of possible catastrophes, especially if warming develops in the high end of the predicted range. As glaciers and ice caps partially melt, according to the United Nations forecast, the level of the oceans would rise by about two feet by the end of the next century. This would place many coastal cities in jeopardy, inundate many low-lying, populous areas in countries like Egypt and Bangladesh and devastate coastal wetlands. Redistribution of Water\nWarming would pour more energy into the climate system, and some studies show that the result would be more frequent and more disastrous storms.\nWhile some areas would receive increased rainfall, others, particularly in the interior of continents, would probably get less. This global redistribution of water would subject some areas to disastrous flooding. In others, drought would devastate agriculture, and some studies show that drought generally would become more frequent.\nOne recent study suggests that agricultural yields would increase in the lower ranges of the predicted warming but decline in the higher ranges, and that farming in industrialized countries would fare better than in the developing world.\nDeveloping countries, according to a U.N. study, would generally be the most vulnerable to climate change because they depend more on agriculture, forests and other natural resources. People in many developing countries already live on the margins of existence, and their plight would be intensified.\nEven if humans were able to adapt, many scientists say, natural ecosystems would not easily be able to do so. While nature has adapted to climate change many times in the past, the rate of change was much slower then, taking place over hundreds or thousands of years. Global warming would take place over mere decades, and ecologists say that many ecosystems would be torn asunder as temperate-zone trees, for example, would be unable to migrate to friendly climes fast enough. Many climate-sensitive habitats could be destroyed, hastening the extinction of species. One study suggests that as much as 40 to 60 percent of the planet's vegetation could be disrupted, and the web of life with it.\nHow all of this might actually play out remains to be seen. But one conclusion seems inescapable:\nBy altering the chemistry of the atmosphere, humans have launched out into unexplored territory."}, {"text": "Punish The Butchers Of Burma\n1992-03-28T05:00:00.000Z\nThe country called Myanmar by its military dictators but known as Burma has turned into a killing field. Since early this year, the army has terrorized ethnic minorities -- burning villages, torturing and forcing thousands to become military porters and to move into labor camps. Almost 200,000 refugees have fled to Bangladesh.\nThe U.N. is sending an Under Secretary General, Jan Eliasson, to Bangladesh on Monday to investigate human rights abuses among the refugees. And yesterday, Norway pressed the Security Council to impose an international arms embargo.\nWhile the U.S. has banned arms sales and opposed any international aid for Burma, it could do much more. U.S.-Burma trade, although relatively small, has doubled since 1988. In 1990, Congress authorized the President to impose trade and investment sanctions. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has unanimously asked the Administration to seek a U.N. arms embargo.\nBut Mr. Bush has refused to do any of this, and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian affairs, Kenneth Quinn, testified before Congress that the Administration's general policy in East Asia is to oppose economic sanctions. Burma, apparently, is no exception.\nOther countries have been even more helpful to the regime. Foreign trade and investment help sustain the military's hold on power. In 1988, after the massacre of thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators, $500 million a year in foreign aid to Burma was suspended and the Government was nearly bankrupt. With no cash to buy weapons, the army was literally running out of bullets.\nStrapped for hard currency, the regime, which had restricted trade and investment to isolate the country, reversed course and solicited foreign business. According to the Burma Action Group, a British human rights organization, the military \"began to sell Burma's natural resources like fast food.\"\nThai businesses, with the help of the Thai Army's commander, Gen. Chaovalit Yonchaiyut, bought the rights to clearcut Burma's teak forests. Logging concessions, which have also been sold to companies from Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan, now generate an estimated $112 million annually.\nTen oil companies -- including Amoco, Unocal, Royal Dutch Shell and Idemitsu -- are investing $320 million in oil exploration. Austrian, Japanese, Singaporean, South Korean and Thai corporations are running department stores, renovating hotels, mining precious gems and building gas pipelines. Pepsi-Cola has opened a bottling plant.\nWith the stampede of foreign business, foreign currency reserves rose from less than $12 million in 1988 to $900 million in 1991. Burma is using this hard currency to expand and modernize its army rather than to benefit the people. In 1988, the armed forces totaled perhaps 190,000. By late 1991, they reached almost 300,000. Military spending amounts to 60 percent of the Government's budget.\nChina, by far Burma's largest arms supplier, trains Burmese pilots and sold the military more than $1 billion worth of aircraft, armored vehicles and small arms in 1990. Other suppliers of military equipment since 1988 include Japan, Pakistan, Poland, Singapore, Thailand and Yugoslavia.\nJapan has exported more than 15,000 Isuzu, Nissan and Toyota trucks, which are being used by the Burmese military -- an action criticized by European Community officials. Japan has also resumed development aid, worth $134 million in 1991.\nSince such economic ties finance Burmese repression, it is difficult to imagine a stronger case for worldwide sanctions on trade and investment. Rather than opposing such sanctions, the Bush Administration should lead a U.N. effort to impose them on Burma's ruthless military regime."}, {"text": "Kennedy Airport, Crossroads for a Constant Flow of Food\n1992-02-19T05:00:00.000Z\nON a runway ramp near Rockaway Boulevard sit 4,000 pounds of fresh fish from Iceland, dinner tomorrow at a resort hotel in Curacao. A few feet away, Fish and Wildlife Service inspectors examine a shipment of wild Scottish grouse and hare, on their way to Manhattan's finest restaurants. Across the tarmac, an El Al 747 filled to capacity with tomatoes, Galil melons and fresh chives for the sun-starved Northeast rolls slowly toward waiting refrigerators.\nThe largest air cargo port in the world is John F. Kennedy International Airport in southern Queens off Jamaica Bay, where 800 flights arrive and depart daily with passengers and freight from 115 countries. More than 65,000 tons of fruit, vegetables, meat and fish entered or left the United States through Kennedy in 1989, the latest year for which figures are available, according to the business development office of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Only Narita Airport in Tokyo rivals J.F.K. for the sheer volume of food it handles.\n\"Air freight right now has allowed us, literally, to become consumers of fresh food from all over the world,\" said Peter J. Nonas, regional manager of Gateway Freight Services, who is a 25-year veteran of the food business. \"In 24 to 48 hours, you can send anything anyplace.\"\n\"It used to be more complicated a few years ago, but some of the new equipment -- these insulated boxes, refrigerated containers -- have really closed the distances,\" he said. \"Now, you pick up the phone and call Chile, call Greece. You want mangoes from Brazil? Call the grower, you can have them custom-picked for you in a day.\n\"We're a spoiled country in that respect. You go to a place in Europe and order a salad, and you get whatever's in season. Here, you always get tomatoes, you always get peppers, you can get whatever you want, any time of year.\"\nFood arrives at and departs from Kennedy two ways: as registered cargo and in passenger luggage. Air freight is expensive compared with ships' rates. At up to $1 a pound for loose packages, air transportation can cost more than the goods themselves, so only certain foods are carried by air: highly perishable items like fresh fish or sweet corn; expensive, lightweight goods like raspberries or saffron; time-sensitive goods like just-released nouveau Beaujolais or fertilized eggs, which are lighter and cheaper to ship than the live chickens, ducks or salmon they will become after arrival. The extra cost is eventually passed on to consumers.\nWhile most goods are familiar -- peppers from Holland, lamb from New Zealand --some are less so, destined for the markets that cater to the tastes of New York's population of diverse ethnic heritages. The monthly importing breakdown from the Department of Agriculture lists tropical fruits like genips, uchava and rambutan, and herbs like dashen leaf. Lufthansa ships live eels from Atlantic shorefront waters to Germany every week, and Avianca brings in purple land crabs from Peru.\nJames Larsen, a former cargo handler who is now manager of Air Cargo Development for the Port Authority, recalled flying millions of tiny seed oysters from Japan to France after the offshore oil spill of 1978 forced Brittany to replenish its oyster beds, and charter flights to Teheran filled with 1,000-pound pregnant cows.\nFood arriving in the United States is subject to inspection by one or more of five Federal regulatory agencies: the Customs Service, which looks for dutiable items and contraband; the Department of Agriculture, which acts to stop dangerous insects and diseases from entering the country; the Food and Drug Administration, which watches for pesticides and other human health dangers (when a few Japanese restaurants in New York wanted to put fugu, the potentially fatal raw blowfish delicacy, on their menus, the F.D.A. inspected the shipments); the National Marine Fisheries Service, which inspects all seafood except salmon and trout, and the Fish and Wildlife Service, which takes care of salmon and trout and makes sure endangered species don't end up on restaurant menus or in Asian pharmacies.\nCosts are higher in New York, and Port Authority officials concede that the city has an \"image problem,\" the result more of movies like \"Goodfellas\" than of fact, they say. They add that Kennedy is eighth among the country's 20 major airports in theft per million dollars in freight.) So why the heavy volume through Kennedy?\nThe primary reason is simple. Most cargo is shipped in the bellies of passenger planes, and J.F.K. is the busiest point of entry and departure in the country. Sometimes, different shipments bound for the same destination are consolidated at New York to save money.\n\"You can get to be part of a consolidation to Helsinki from New York,\" Mr. Larsen said. \"You can't get to be part of a consolidation to Helsinki from Philadelphia or Baltimore, because nobody flies to Helsinki from Philadelphia or Baltimore. There are 1,800 flights a day from the three New York airports.\"\nIn a competitive industry, location in the country's largest metropolitan area is no guarantee of future business. The Port Authority works hard to sell Kennedy around the world, not only as a destination airport but also as a distribution airport, vying with O'Hare in Chicago for goods that end up in Pittsburgh, and Miami for the Baltimore trade.\n\"I see us as the most logical airport on the East Coast,\" Mr. Larsen said. \"We're one day's drive from half the population of the United States. We're physically -- flight time -- closest to the European markets.\" \nAnd with food shipments in mind, the Port Authority is underwriting the construction of the largest storage structure for perishables in the country -- 100,000 cubic feet of refrigeration space in a building that will also house the Customs Service and Agriculture Department. It will have testing laboratories for the agencies, equipment for re-icing of fish and separate temperature zones for holding such shipments as Thai orchids, Philippine bananas and frozen shrimp from Bangladesh.\nWhile the bulk of the food business is cargo, the full scope of the world's bounty is brought into the country -- or at least as far as the International Arrivals Building -- in passenger luggage. Some items are not illegal, like kouri, roasted guinea pig from Ecuador. Some are clearly illegal, like homemade kielbasa from Poland, or the ackee flower from Guyana -- delicious when mature but toxic if picked too young. Some items defy easy description.\n\"Take the Guyana flight,\" said Joseph Gittelman, a supervisor for the Department of Agriculture, as he walked through the baggage claim area looking for food smugglers. \"Last week we had a couple of meat items that we couldn't figure out. \n\"We got them back here,\" he added, indicating his department's forensic office, hidden in the middle of the arrivals floor, \"poked one around a little bit, finally figured out that it was half an armadillo.\" He seemed thoughtful. \"Wild harvest. Found a lot of buckshot in it.\"\nThe Agriculture Department inspectors are highly trained in animal and plant identification. Many have advanced degrees in botany, veterinary medicine or entomology. In the offices are hundreds of seized samples, taken for identification purposes. \nOn a recent day the big catch seemed to be chestnuts -- every other passenger returning from Italy had a bagful. They were promptly confiscated at the Customs desk. Although chestnuts are imported by the millions, they first must undergo fumigation, supervised by the Agriculture Department, to eliminate curculionidae, the chestnut weevil. This was apparently news to some very sullen-looking tourists who were clutching bags of tasty and expensive souvenirs.\nIn a sealed jar in a laboratory were several small white oblong objects preserved in alcohol, seized from an arriving passenger. They were potatoes, seized to avert introduction of nematodes. What kind of person brings potatoes into the United States, Mr. Gittelman was asked?\n\"Peruvian natives,\" he replied. \"People who visit there.\"\nBut potatoes?\n\"Oh,\" he said, smiling. \"For them, it's just, well, you know, something back from the old country.\""}, {"text": "U.N. Doctor Charges Iraq Hinders Children's Care\n1992-08-09T05:00:00.000Z\nThe United Nations doctor overseeing children's health care in Iraq has complained that the Government is obstructing his work despite serious problems among children, including many cases of weight loss and the threat of a measles epidemic.\nDr. Enzio Gianni Murzi of Italy, who heads the United Nations Children's Fund's delegation in Iraq, said in an interview here that since the start of July the Iraqi Government had refused to issue his staff and drivers the travel permits that are necessary for moving about the country.\nAs a result, his staff is unable to supervise and monitor the children's health programs that Unicef is supporting outside Baghdad. Local truck drivers are also unable to deliver medical supplies to health care centers.\nIn July Unicef requested travel permits to deliver seven consignments of medicines to different parts of the country, but nothing has been granted.\nSince the Iraqi Government also refuses to renew United Nations staff residency permits or issue new ones, Dr. Murzi said he could not replace staff members who go on leave or whose contracts expire. \"We face enormous problems,\" he said. \"Our professional capacity is decreasing.\"\nDr. Murzi's problems are shared by other United Nations agencies working to ease the impact of the economic embargo on vulnerable groups in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war. They are also shared by the handful of private groups doing similar work, like Catholic Relief Services, CARE, Oxfam, the Quakers and the Middle East Council of Churches.\nThe agreement, negotiated between Iraq and the United Nations, under which all these agencies and organizations are operating in the country expired at the end of June and thus far Baghdad has refused to renew it. Iraq has not asked foreign relief workers to leave, and the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has ordered them to remain at their posts while he presses for an extension. But lack of travel and residency permits means that their operations are becoming steadily less effective.\n\"Drivers are afraid to go out on the road without these permits, so our activities are being reduced,\" said Mohammed Saleheen, the Bangladeshi official running the United Nations World Food Programs. Food Aid for Poor Iraqis\nThe W.F.P. distributes free food to more than a million very poor Iraqis who cannot afford to supplement the Government's basic food ration.\nThe restrictions on Unicef's activities, Dr. Murzi says, have come at a moment when many young Iraqi children are facing two new health threats for the first time since the gulf war. Dr. Murzi said shortages of infant formula and other baby food had left about 300,000 children under 5 with serious weight loss. \"This makes them vulnerable to any other diseases that come along,\" he said.\nWhile diarrheal diseases remain a severe threat to young children, Dr. Murzi said he was particularly worried by signs that an epidemic of measles was breaking out this year.\nThe Iraqi authorities reported 7,000 measles cases in May, and the Health Ministry has forecast a total of about 70,000 cases for the whole year. Iraq has asked Unicef for vaccines, and these are being sent.\nBut Dr. Murzi estimates that about a million children are vulnerable to the disease because they have not been vaccinated against it.\nExperts remain divided over how much of an increase in child mortality United Nations trade sanctions have brought about, but everyone agrees that there has been some increase. Just after the gulf war, the United Nations Population Division estimated deaths among children under the age of 5 had risen from some 30 per thousand births before the war to about 63.\nBut last summer a report by an international team concluded after visiting Iraq that the mortality rate among very young children had then reached 80 per thousand."}, {"text": "U.N. Let the Somali Famine Get Out of Hand, Aide Says\n1992-08-16T05:00:00.000Z\nThe famine in Somalia could have been mitigated if the United Nations had dispatched relief experts months ago instead of relying on a small crew of junior staff members in the country, a senior United Nations official said.\n\"It's so bad because we've let things simmer without paying proper attention,\" said Trevor Page, the newly appointed head of the World Food Program in Somalia. \"We've had inexperienced people who don't know what they are seeing, who don't know what the implications are and didn't blow the whistle.\"\nMr. Page, who has worked for the United Nations food agency for 30 years, and who directed all emergency programs in the 1980's, said he had not seen such human suffering since the Biafra famine of the late 1960's and the Bangladesh crisis of 1971. \"But in those places we were much better organized,\" he said.\nThe World Food Program made its first airlift to Baidoa today on a C-130 Hercules transport packed with 17 tons of high-protein biscuits for the more than 8,000 seriously malnourished children being fed at four centers. 20,000 Meals a Day\nMore than 20,000 hungry adults are served one meal a day here at outdoor kitchens by the International Committee of the Red Cross.\nThe United Nations plane, which had Mr. Page on board, was met by Anita Ennis, one of two nurses who runs the feeding centers on behalf of Irish Concern, a relief agency based in Ireland.\n\"The biscuits are really important, we had a limited supply,\" Miss Ennis said as she watched the cartons being unloaded from the plane onto trucks. \"We can use them fairly freely now that we know we will get a good flow.\"\nMr. Page said the United Nations airlift would continue until arrangements could be made to protect truck convoys from the wartorn Somali capital, Mogadishu, to Baidoa. The trucks have come under fire from heavily armed looters. Gangs Steal Animals\nThe town has attracted tens of thousands of hungry people from the bush, many left bereft by gangs who have stolen their animals in the anarchy that has enveloped Somalia since a civil war intensified last November.\nIn addition to the war, the country on the Horn of Africa has suffered the effects of a long drought. Its population, estimated variously at between 4.5 million and 6 million, is made up largely of nomadic peoples.\nRelief workers say children are dying daily in the feeding centers and bodies are still seen strewn on the roads leading into Baidoa, even though food deliveries by the Red Cross started here last month.\nThe question of how to get food to starving Somalis amid continuing violence has suddenly seized the attention of both Washington and the United Nations.\nTo alleviate the lack of food, which, according to the Red Cross is causing the deaths hundreds, perhaps thousands daily, the Pentagon announced Friday that it would airlift 140,000 tons of food to Somalia.\nMr. Page said that the World Food Program planned to airlift 5,000 tons of food to rural centers in most need. The country needed 400,000 tons of food this year, he said. So far, just over 100,000 tons has been delivered.\n\"Because of the disorganization in the United Nations, less than a third of the food that is needed has been delivered,\" he said. Food Cannot Be Delivered\nBut Mr. Page said that, despite the desperate situation in many areas where there are still high death rates from starvation, large amounts of food could not be delivered until nongovernmental relief agencies were found to run the feeding centers in those places.\n\"You can't just airlift to a community,\" he said. \"The food disappears by looting.\"\nThe bandits, heavily armed gangs of young men driving powerful four-wheel-drive vehicles, have made it extremely difficult for aid agencies to deliver food to those who need it in the quantities required.\nTo protect the enormous shipments of food anticipated in the coming months the Security Council has authorized the dispatch of an infantry battalion of 500 armed troops.\nThe United Nations soldiers will not arrive for another three weeks and that is only if the complicated logistical planning of stationing such a contingent in Mogadishu goes \"like clockwork,\" said Brig. Gen. Imtiaz Shaheen, the Pakistani chief of the 50 unarmed United Nations soldiers already in Somalia observing the cease-fire. General Shaheen, who said he would lead the armed battalion, said that the soldiers would be armed with heavy submachine guns.\n\"This is not combat and there should be no need for mortars or heavy caliber weapons,\" he said. U.N. Troops to Secure Ports\nThe battalion would be restricted to securing the port and airport of Mogadishu, the main entry points for food, and escorting the food to five points within the city for distribution to the rural areas.\nViolence flared at the port in the capital this week as the Red Cross struggled to unload the remaining 1,200 tons of food from a ship that had carried 7,000 tons and that has been docked at the port since Aug. 1.\nA convoy of 20 trucks, each carrying 200 sacks of rice and many with armed men on top to provide protection from looters, emerged Thursday from the bullet-strewn dockside as gunfire at the gate died down. Just as the trucks were ready to drive out, a gunman started to shoot at the gate, demanding a bag of rice. A member of the port security staff, without uniform and looking like any other gunman around Mogadishu, fired into the air and then pointed his AK-47 at the gunman.\nWhile no one was killed in the exchange, two gunmen were killed on the dock alongside the ship last week. Salad Hussein, the Somali field officer for the Red Cross at the port, said that two men were shot in an altercation over food.\n\"It's just luck that I haven't been hit by a bullet,\" said Mr. Hussein, who negotiates among the various security gangs that are supposed to guard the port but in fact are responsible for much of the looting. Red Crescent Workers Shot\nNo section of the port is safe. Many staff members of the Somali Red Crescent who work alongside the Red Cross staff, have been wounded by bullets. One of them, Ahmed Hassan Duelle, pointed to bullet scars on his leg and arms. \"It's normal,\" he shrugged.\nAs laborers unloaded bags of rice from the ship's holds on Friday, there was frequent gunfire just 50 yards away on the edge of the dock area, cordoned off by a wall of shipping containers. Suddenly the unloading stopped because 20 men with AK-47s, recognized by Mr. Hussein and others as professional looters paid by merchants to steal food at gunpoint, were allowed through the wall onto the dock by the port security, who themselves would get a cut of the stolen food.\nMr. Hussein said that on Thursday he was sitting in his port office -- an open-ended shipping container -- when two disabled Somalis came in on crutches. One man showed a mortar and a pistol, the other carried an AK-47.\n\"They said they would do something terrible for the image of the Red Cross if I didn't give them a bag of rice, which meant they would kill me,\" Mr. Hussein said. \"They are prepared to die for a bag of rice.\"\nMr. Hussein said he was determined not to give in, and called his own armed security men, who disarmed the pair.\n\"The looting is habitual,\" said Dr. Salad Farah Gutali, the health minister of a United Somali Congress faction who was at the port on Friday. \"It is normal. Men like guns psychologically. It means nothing to steal large amounts of food when they see no institutions, no law and order and when they and others are desparate for food.\"\n\"The port is chaos,\" said General Shaheen. \"There is violence for many reasons. Jobs, food. We have to get some management there, and stop having it done on a day to day basis.\"\nWhile the Red Cross tried to get the last bags of rice out of the ship, another vessel with 10,000 tons from the United Nations waited its turn outside the port to unload. It had been waiting there for days, relief officials said."}, {"text": "On My Mind; The Absent Americans\n1992-05-15T05:00:00.000Z\nThe chance was lying there for weeks -- the opportunity for the United States to make a gesture in support of a people it had betrayed.\nIt was a chance important politically, and important morally, and cost-free. No announcement has been made yet, but the United States has taken its decision. It has refused.\nThe opportunity was for the U.S. to do what other countries are doing -- send observers to witness as the Kurdish people carry out an astonishing political gamble.\nOn May 17 about one million Kurds are expected to vote, choosing a legislative assembly. Never before has there been an election like it -- by a persecuted people, in the midst of a war for their survival, in the face of the enemy, within range of his guns.\nThe Kurds are a Muslim, non-Arab people scattered through Iraq, Turkey, Iran, Syria and some of the southern republics of the former Soviet Union. Now and then one Western or Mideastern nation or another decides the Kurds might be useful as pawns in one war or another.\nDuring the gulf war President Bush mused aloud about wishing the Iraqi people would rid him of Saddam Hussein. The Kurds, trusting America, rose against the man who had murdered all the years of his reign.\nSo, after Saddam was defeated, the U.S. allowed him to keep and use the helicopters, artillery and divisions he needed to try to destroy the Kurds altogether. He failed that time, but the sight of Kurds dying in the mountain passes shocked the world, for a while.\nThe Kurds now hold part of the Iraqi areas where they seek self-government -- autonomy, not statehood. According to U.S. sources, Saddam has been told that still another full-scale attack against the Kurds will bring U.S. reprisals. He does not seem terrified. The same sources also say that he has doubled the size of his forces ranged against the Kurds.\nThe Kurds, we are often reminded by some of the American specialists who built up Saddam Hussein, are a quarrelsome, fractious lot. Perhaps, but maintaining unity and delicacy under centuries of massacre can be a bit difficult.\nAnyway, the Kurds will hold an election in the midst of ongoing war, day-to-day danger and deprivation. The Kurds say that Saddam's blockade means that they get only about 25 percent of the food and supplies available to other Iraqis.\nThe Kurds thought the U.S. might like to witness such an election. They asked the U.S. to send observers, as it has for elections in Nicaragua, Bangladesh, Albania, Namibia, Chile, among other places.\nThe State Department said no. Why, Saddam Hussein might say Americans were involved in the election. And one fellow on the Iraqi desk actually trotted out the \"Arab streets\" again and how they might rise if the U.S. dared send observers.\nThen the Department began warning off Congressional aides and other Americans who planned to go privately.\nThey were told that it would be dangerous. Saddam Hussein may try some election-day nastiness. But as one Californian said after Los Angeles, that did not freeze his blood.\nThe Americans were also warned they could be prosecuted under an executive order barring commerce with Iraq. That neatly lumps Saddam and his victims together as the enemy, which must tickle him.\nRepresentative Lee Hamilton of Indiana tried to get the State Department to allow private Americans to go. Back came a letter from Assistant Secretary of State Janet G. Mullins saying that if the Kurds wanted observers, let them go ask any of the \"growing number of democracies around the world.\" She wrote it, unembarrassed. I have the letter and will cherish it.\nOne Administration official said observers had been vetoed because Turkey, which has problems with Turkish Kurds, would be upset. Apparently he did not have the late news: Turkey will send observers itself.\nA few Americans who were warned off are going anyway -- among them Mike O'Callaghan, the former Governor of Nevada, an amputee of the Korean War; but the U.S. Government will be studiously absent.\nFor the Kurds, official witness would have meant that the Bush Administration was not only acknowledging their willingness to gamble on democracy but giving them some respect and dignity. Those things seem to have value to those fractious Kurds."}, {"text": "Savage Intolerance; Fundamentalism In South Asia Isn't All Islam\n1992-12-13T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE cry on the lips of the fanatical Hindus who stormed and destroyed an obscure mosque in the northern Indian town of Ayodhya was deafening and terse: \"Jai Sri Ram!\" (\"Hail Lord Ram!\").\nThe cry on the lips of the mujahadeen who roared into Kabul last spring was also terse: \"Allahu Akbar!\" (\"God Is Great!\").\nIn India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bhutan, Kashmir and Sri Lanka, throughout South Asia, the claim on people's emotions and politics, and the driving force of armies, guerrilla warfare, human-rights abuses and Government policy is, increasingly, the power of fundamentalist beliefs. These forces are stronger and more articulate in some places than others, but everywhere reasoned discourse is being displaced by the intolerance of fundamentalism.\nFundamentalist religious and political organizations have won broad appeal, particularly in India, where last week more than 1,000 people died in sectarian violence.\nHere religious issues are being drawn more and more starkly. The Hindu fundamentalists' use of the mythical god Ram, a warrior king whose exploits are told in the epic the Ramayana, exemplifies the manipulation of Hinduism for political purposes and propagating intolerance, especially in northern India.\nFor millenniums, Hinduism has been eclectic, embracing and flexible. It was not bound by one deity or text, or a hierarchical clergy or uniform liturgy. It proscribed little and tolerated much. Under centuries of invasion, invasions by Muslims at that, it was astonishingly resilient. India Surrounded\nBut now, as Indians see themselves surrounded by Islamic states -- Pakistan and Afghanistan to the west, Bangladesh to the east, the central Asian republics to the north -- a less accommodating Hinduism has become not only appealing, but necessary. And the Ramayana, the eighth-century B.C. allegorical account of the Aryan migration into India and the first conflicts between agriculturists and hunter-gatherers, has become the crucible on which this nationalist ideology is being forged.\nIn recent years, Hindu leaders decided that they had found the exact spot where the god Ram was born. The site was an undistinguished mosque built in 1528 by the Mogul invader Babur in an obscure but holy Hindu town. The mosque wasn't used much, so a decision to put idols of Ram inside met no resistance. But a crisis ensued. Hindus demanded that the mosque be replaced by a temple to Ram, and Muslims insisted that the idols be relocated in Ayodhya and the temple built there. 'Lord Ram Descended'\nVishnu Hari Dalmia, the president of the World Hindu Council, a hard-core religious group that demanded the demolition of the mosque and that was declared an illegal organization last week, expressed in a recent interview the Hindus' uncompromising stance. \"Muslim fundamentalism is going throughout the world,\" he said, adding that it should be checked somewhere. \"Thousands of Hindu religious places have been destroyed by the Moguls. According to the Hindu religious belief, Lord Ram descended on this spot. Hindus have been fighting to regain possession of this place for hundreds of years. This is not a matter to be decided in the courts. This is a matter of faith.\"\nSo the battle line is drawn by Hindu fundamentalists. Political counterparts of religious groups have mushroomed in popularity. Just three years ago, the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Hindu fundamentalist political party, was another minor party. Now it is the largest opposition party in Parliament.\nIn Pakistan, a nation created for religious reasons, the forces of fundamentalist Islam have always been stronger than secular ideals. In a country where 97 percent of the population adheres to Islam, and where poverty and illiteracy are rampant, the collusion of fundamentalism and extremist politics was inevitable.\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif has turned to fundamentalist leaders to lend religious legitimacy to sometimes unpopular policies, to consolidate his control and, in his view, to buy off challengers. The consequences have led steadily to a religious state. Religious law is practiced, alcohol is banned, television shows are censored and women, while not forced to wear chadors, are pressured into covering their heads. Sensing blood, fundamentalists have demanded that interest be banned in banking. For the fundamentalists, Pakistan's civil courts are subservient to the religious courts, and the constitution to religious law.\nIslamic fundamentalism is thriving elsewhere. The victory of guerrilla armies in Afghanistan was driven more by religious zeal than distaste for Communism. The so-called victors (the country has been parceled among warlords, guerrilla groups and former militias) imposed a rigorous version of Islam by banishing women to the home or the veil, installing religious law in crime and civil disputes, suffusing education with Islamic ideals and banning traditional entertainment.\nBangladesh, never comfortablewith Islam, has been battered in the last year by zealous students and mullahs. Increasingly, religious slogans are mixing with the political, and the criterion of truth is religious, not civil.\nFor Bhutan, a tiny Buddhist kingdom on India's northern border, conformity in dress, language and religion is dictated. In fact, Bhutanese forces have driven Nepalese immigrants in the south across the border. Human-rights groups regard Bhutanization as one of the region's most persistent problems.\nSri Lanka struggled in the 1980's with extreme Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism, represented by the shadowy group called the Janata Vimukti Peramuna, or People's Liberation Front. In subduing the movement, Government death squads and the army killed perhaps 50,000 Sri Lankans. Now, as Tamil separatists persist in their guerrilla war for an independent country, rumors of a revival of Sinhalese nationalism are once again reverberating.\nBut it is in India where antisecularist and antidemocratic fundamentalism is rising. The Congress Party, which has ruled India for most of its post-independence history, is floundering. Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao, a secularist who expressed anguish over the destruction and violence at the Ayodhya mosque, seems unsure in the challenge by Hindu fundamentalism. He called for a campaign of national education."}, {"text": "Advice From the Trenches\n1992-11-01T05:00:00.000Z\nMOVING MOUNTAINS Lessons in Leadership and Logistics From the Gulf War. By William G. Pagonis with Jeffrey L. Cruikshank. Illustrated. 248 pp. Boston: Harvard Business School Press.\nHAVING kept American forces well supplied during the Persian Gulf war, Lieut. Gen. William G. Pagonis now offers corporate America lessons in innovative management. \"Moving Mountains: Lessons in Leadership and Logistics From the Gulf War\" is not a modest book. General Pagonis maintains that, in effect, his achievements as the leader of a huge Army logistics team rank him among the nation's more imaginative and effective top executives.\nMilitary memoirs, in his view, are no longer the preserve of combat commanders like General Grant or General Eisenhower or, most recently, General Schwarzkopf. Supplying military expeditions in the post-cold war era is also heroic, he believes, and the Army's performance in the gulf is evidence that America is supreme in that field. \"Our logistical successes in the gulf war,\" General Pagonis writes, \"suggest to me that our colleagues in the private sector may now get some good guidance from us.\" In the 19th century European generals came to this country to learn something about moving and supplying large, complicated forces by observing P. T. Barnum's maneuvers with his vast circus. Now American industry, the general suggests, should look not only to Japan and Germany for lessons in efficiency, but also to the United States Army.\nThat would be quite a spinoff victory from the gulf war, if it were true. But while General Pagonis is clearly an effective executive, his management precepts are already known to corporate America, or should be. More than a decade of self-analysis and self-criticism for having lost the industrial lead to Japan and Germany has produced a huge volume of literature on how to manage workers, reorganize and inspire them, and how to keep strategic goals simple and flexible.\n\"Moving Mountains,\" written with Jeffrey L. Cruickshank, a communications consultant, is a bracing review of these lessons, even offering an original management tool: 3-by-5 cards, each with a handwritten message, that General Pagonis and his corps used by the thousands to keep information flowing rapidly. But such management agility is now standard in corporate America, and \"Moving Mountains\" is far from being a breakthrough book.\nDisconcertingly, General Pagonis shifts back and forth from memoir to management textbook, with the latter occupying two-thirds of the book. The memoir is more vivid, anecdotal and instructive. For months William (Gus) Pagonis was billed in the news media as the logistics genius who, as head of the Army's 22d Support Command, had fed, housed and equipped more than half a million American troops on short notice. As he notes, moving that large a force and all its equipment was like moving the whole state of Alaska and everything in it around the globe and then keeping it going. How did he do it? General Pagonis offers a broad outline, but starves his readers for detail.\nOne lesson comes through loud and clear. Saudi Arabia turned out to be a well-equipped and friendly staging area for a war. When the general arrived with a skeleton staff, he rented Saudi buses to transport the thousands of troops piling up on airport tarmacs without a clue about what to do next. And he secured 10,000 Bedouin tents to help house them.\nThe greatest feat, getting so many Americans and so much ammunition and equipment from the United States to Saudi Arabia in a few weeks, is not the subject of this book, and that is disappointing. Others managed this aspect of the operation; the general and his men -- a corporate work force, so to speak, that reached 50,000 people -- handled the distribution within Saudi Arabia.\nAnd for all their organizational skills, they might have failed if the Saudis had not made available deep-water ports with excellent docks and huge warehouses, fresh food and thousands of trucks and buses that were rented, each with a driver, from the Philippines, Korea, Turkey or Bangladesh. The same war, staged from a much less friendly country like Jordan or Syria, might not have made the 51-year-old General Pagonis such a management hero.\nMOVING tanks hundreds of miles to the front line, for example, was a major problem. Under their own steam, the tanks would have torn up the asphalt highways or burned too much fuel and created too many maintenance problems. General Pagonis urgently needed big transport trucks, and the Army had only 112 in Saudi Arabia. \"We were able to assemble a fleet of nearly 1,300 H.E.T.'s [ heavy equipment transporters ] and tractor trailers, most of which came equipped with experienced third-country national drivers,\" the general reports. And on to the next problem.\nZahir Mastri, a friend of King Fahd, solved General Pagonis's fresh-food problem. As the general tells the story in an amusing section of the book, troops waiting months in the desert for the war to start required a diet that went beyond dry Army rations, and Mr. Mastri's company, Astra Foods, operated the largest covered farm in the world. Soon Astra Foods and the Pagonis team had mess halls everywhere as well as mobile fast-food canteens, with King Fahd paying most of the bill. King Fahd, the good Arab host, had sent Mr. Mastri to the Americans.\nA successful company, of course, is not only efficient but profitable. The gulf war's urgency saved General Pagonis from budget constraints, and the Army's buying power was a magnet not only for Saudi merchants but also for suppliers in neighboring countries. \"Word spread like wildfire that the American military was paying in Saudi riyals -- a desirable currency -- and that payment was made every two weeks,\" General Pagonis writes. \"Since the Saudi Government was in the habit of paying its vendors only once or twice a year, we were suddenly the favorite clients on the block.\"\nAnd in the end it is that buying power that makes Army executives, even those as skilled as General Pagonis, less than credible as management gurus."}, {"text": "KITCHEN BOOKSHELF; Someone's In the Kitchen With . . . a Book\n1992-12-09T05:00:00.000Z\nJADED as I am, I sometimes wonder whether the world really needs another cookbook. Yet, cooking titles continue to pour off publishers' lists, especially now at gift-giving season, promising fulfillment from old ways or rejuvenation from new ones, cautioning healthful restraint or endorsing self-indulgence, introducing us to new products, new techniques, new ethnic cuisines.\nCharts, polls and surveys all indicate that no one cooks anymore, yet someone out there is buying cookbooks -- a lot of someones, by the look of it -- and if the current offerings are anything to go by, the cooks are fearless in the kitchen and increasingly interested in alternatives to the standard meat-and-two-vegetables American dinner plate.\nCookbooks for out-and-out vegetarians are still rare, and those that provide real flavor or a sense of elegance in the recipes are rarer still, so YAMUNA'S TABLE by Yamuna Devi (Dutton, $23) is especially welcome. The recipes are \"inspired by\" Indian flavors rather than authentically Indian: Native American quinoa macaroni and cheese with vegetables is a long way from Bombay. Many of the preparations would please the most resolute carnivore, and the book as a whole is a useful source for those who simply want to add more vegetable variety to their tables. Be warned, however: the ingredients lists can be daunting and substitutions often bizarre -- anyone who finds California pitted black olives an adequate substitute for the finest Greek Kalamatas is shopping a different aisle from the one I'm in.\nNot everyone is becoming vegetarian, but almost everyone is interested in reducing quantities of red meat on the table. A FEAST FOR THE HEART by Willa Gelber (Little, Brown; $21.95), written with Greg Case, is billed as a low-cholesterol cookbook, but it's a good deal more than that. This is healthful food but not health food. The recipes are for dishes with style and charm, each one presented as part of a total entertaining plan. The menus grew from Ms. Gelber's experience as a successful New York City caterer; the low-cholesterol part came when she was told that her cholesterol count was dangerously high. Except for a Christmas saddle of venison, no red meat appears in the book, and even the venison provides a low-cholesterol serving, especially in the context of the whole holiday menu. A nutritionist's per-serving counts of total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol and calories are given for each recipe.\nCookbooks on cuisines from other parts of the world can provide alternatives to the high-meat American diet, at the same time offering enticing glimpses into the manners and means of another culture. The best of these are deeply affecting, written from the heart by those who have set themselves the task of remembering cultures that have all too often disappeared. Two with special appeal this season are Zarela Martinez's FOOD FROM MY HEART (Macmillan, $25) and Mary Urrutia Randelman's MEMORIES OF A CUBAN KITCHEN (Macmillan, $25). Each book functions more or less as a memoir with recipes.\nMs. Martinez, chef-owner of the restaurant Zarela on Manhattan's Upper East Side, recalls her youth on a northern Mexico cattle ranch, nicely weaving together information about ingredients, recipes, anecdotes of her childhood and lore about Mexican history and folk culture. Ms. Randelman's memories roam all over Cuba, which she left at age 10, as she recounts lunches at the Havana Yacht Club and family feasts on the Urrutias' tobacco, citrus and cattle spreads. Cuban food is not all black beans and rice, by this account, but rather a rich composite of braised and grilled seafood and meats (often marinated in garlic and bitter-orange juice), salads of fresh vegetables and stews of native root vegetables like yuca, boniato and malanga.\nBharti Kirchner, a cook and writer in Seattle, is a native of Bengal, the region of the Ganges Delta that straddles India and Bangladesh. THE HEALTHY CUISINE OF INDIA: RECIPES FROM THE BENGAL REGION (Lowell House, $24.95) is a tribute to her native cuisine, less a memoir than the books above but still replete with hints of how the food fits the culture and religion of this rich, subtropical land. This is an irresistible cuisine -- I keep going back to try recipes like chholar ghughni, a chickpea stew fragrant with seasonings and browned onions, and murghir dom, boneless chicken braised in an onion and ginger puree and served with a coriander-yogurt sauce. Low-fat alternatives are offered for many recipes, and there is a full chapter on vegetarian cooking, as well as one on dhals, the lentil and bean dishes so typical of Bengali cuisine.\nItalian cookbooks continue to be the strongest subcategory among ethnic cookbooks. The owner of a New York bookstore told me that anything with an Italian word in it practically walks out of his shop.\nTHE SPLENDID TABLE (Morrow, $30) by Lynne Rossetto Kasper is a compilation of recipes from the Emilia-Romagna region of north-central Italy, the northern Italian heartland, as rich in agriculture as it is in culinary traditions. The book, as interesting to folklorists and food historians as it will be to cooks, is a fine tribute to a region that even other Italians, notoriously picky when it comes to food, look to as the standard-bearer for their national cuisine.\nAnother new title on the Italian cookbook shelf is Clifford Wright's CUCINA PARADISO (Simon & Schuster, $25) argues for the strength of Arab traditions in Sicily by offering recipes of what Sicilians call la cucina arabosicula. I have a little trouble with some of the history, like the idea that \"the Arabs grew summer squash in great abundance.\" But the recipes are evocative of a world of flavor combinations derived from the Arab culture that remained intact on the island, the author tells us, for four centuries -- a good deal longer than British culture has existed in North America.\nAnna del Conte's A CASA (HarperCollins, $27.50) is another collection from that good cook and teacher. Arranged seasonally in menu form, the recipes, as the title suggests, are evocative of Italian home cooking, which is, as almost anyone knows, the best food in Italy. The recipes are clear enough for even rookie cooks to follow, and they make sense in terms of the kinds of food many people want to eat today -- fresh, flavorful, simply prepared, with less emphasis on meat and more on vegetables.\nPlenty of Italian food is included in Molly O'Neill's NEW YORK COOKBOOK (Workman, $17.95). See her discourse on pizza along with those on Chinese, Irish, Jamaican, Greek, Korean, Polish and most other ethnic groups that have set foot in New York City. Like a Circle Line tour that means, willy-nilly, to show you everything, this book offers recipes, shopping notes, neighborhood food tours, bits of culinary history, chats with cooks, and explanations of technique from a plenitude of New York restaurants (posh and otherwise) and peeks at home kitchens, bakeries, delis, pickle factories, fish smokehouses, markets and other places where food is the focus. Ms. O'Neill, an otherwise sensible native of Columbus, Ohio, who writes about food for The New York Times, has been thoroughly smitten by New York City and its food ways. Even those who aren't will find her joy catching.\nThere is a special place on the kitchen bookshelf for books that are more words than recipes, books for the cook to read while the sauce is simmering or the cookies baking (and for all those who are passionately interested in food but almost never step into the kitchen -- except to borrow a book). Those fascinated by the way food forms culture will want to look at Kathy Neustadt's CLAMBAKE (University of Massachusetts Press, $40 hardbound and $14.95 paper), which is both a loving celebration of an annual community event, the century-old Allen's Neck clambake in Rhode Island, and an insightful examination of how public rituals like it help people define who they are.\nEmbedded in THE CAROLINA RICE KITCHEN: THE AFRICAN CONNECTION by Karen Hess (University of South Carolina Press, $24) is a little book of recipes for rice cookery published in Charleston in 1901. The recipes are intriguing, but the real interest is the introductory material by Ms. Hess, one of this country's best-known culinary historians. She argues cogently for African and French (but more African than French) origins for the celebrated cuisine of the Carolina Low Country. Like American music, American cooking has roots in West Africa that have seldom been acknowledged. This book is one more piece of evidence for our culture's African origins.\nCLASSIC RUSSIAN COOKING (University of Indiana Press, $39.95) is an annotated translation of a somewhat abridged version of Elena Molokhovets's \"A Gift to Young Housewives,\" the 19th-century Russian version of Fannie Farmer's Boston Cooking School Cookbook. Dr. Joyce Toomre, a Russian scholar and culinary historian, is responsible for the translation of this compendium, which ranges from a \"real Russian coulibiac\" to instructions for preserving sorrel: \"When the mown grass begins to grow again in September, then sorrel also begins to send up fresh shoots and turn green. This is the time to gather it and preserve it for winter.\" Dr. Toomre's lucid analysis of the book and its place in Russian culture is particularly useful for anyone curious about 19th-century Russian customs, the severity of Lenten fasts, the structure of stoves or the relationship between master (or mistress) and servant (or serf).\nThe category of books as good to read as they are to cook from must include REAL BEER AND GOOD EATS (Knopf, $23) by Bruce Aidells and Denis Kelly, a cross-country celebration of American beer and recipes for the kind of old-timey saloon fare that goes best with it -- veal shanks and winter vegetables in ale, for instance, gingerbread stout cake, beer-baked beans and even bollito misto prepared, somewhat surprisingly, with two cups of amber ale. This is saloon food, robust and aggressively flavored. The authors verify beer's important place in American history and assess the state of the art of brewing today with a region-by-region tour of breweries and taverns.\nAnyone who hasn't yet had enough of the Columbus Quincentennial, and anyone else interested in how New World foods (corn, potatoes, chocolate, peanuts and so on) have changed the ways people eat and cook the world over, will want to look at Elizabeth Rozin's BLUE CORN AND CHOCOLATE (Knopf, $23). With more recipes than text, she traces food routes from one culture to another. Peppers, for instance, show up in a Catalan romesco sauce or a roast-pepper focaccia from Italy, in chicken paprika and Hungarian goulash soup, then in a hot pepper and lamb dish from India, and stuffed with shrimp and scallions in dim sum."}, {"text": "Serbian Forces Surround a City In a Muslim Enclave in Bosnia\n1992-08-10T05:00:00.000Z\nSerbian forces are tightening a noose around the northwestern corner of Bosnia and Herzegovina, cutting food deliveries and escape routes for 300,000 increasingly desperate residents.\nSome relief workers fear that Bihac, the largest city in this Muslim enclave, could soon become a second Sarajevo, an encircled city consumed by violence and human suffering.\nSerbs based in the hills above Bihac have been bombarding the city since mid-June. United Nations soldiers posted here to monitor relief shipments say that more than 500 shells sometimes land in a single day.\nIn radio broadcasts, Serbian commanders have told the people of Bihac that the shelling will stop if all of the city's 70,000 residents agree to leave. If they insist on staying, the broadcasts say, they face the prospect of continued bombardment and possible starvation. Waiting to Be Saved\n\"They are trying to clear this area of Muslim people,\" said Ibrahim Kozlica, a Muslim who had operated a cafe in Bihac. \"I wanted to send my wife and children out, but there is no way. We are waiting for God to save us.\"\nBecause the local Muslim authorities are still in control of Bihac and surrounding areas, as they are in Sarajevo, Serbs cannot summarily move people out. In other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina they have taken military control and then begun the process of \"ethnic cleansing,\" or forcing other ethnic groups to leave.\nUnited Nations officials say they are caught between two unpleasant alternatives as they consider how to help the besieged residents of Bihac and the rest of the Muslim enclave in northwest Bosnia. If they agree to sponsor a mass evacuation, they say, they will in effect become accessories to the \"ethnic cleansing\" process, which they consider repugnant. But they fear that if they do not attempt such an evacuation, they will be leaving residents to a gruesome fate.\n\"It's a human and political calamity that's just waiting to happen,\" said Cedric Thornberry, civilian affairs director for the United Nations peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslavia. \"It will require a major change in policy on the part of the Serbs if that calamity is not to occur. Many of us have nightmares about it.\"\nThe commander of United Nations military mission here, Maj. Ziaul Haider of Bangladesh, met with local Serbian leaders last month to ask why they were shelling Bihac and other communities in this area. \"They said they want to move all Muslims out of Bosnia and replace them with Serbs,\" he recalled.\n\"They really don't have any military objective,\" he said. \"The shelling is directed to civilian areas to terrorize people.\" About 150 people have been killed and 1,000 wounded since the shelling began, he said. He estimated that 95 percent of the victims were civilians.\nMuch of the bombing is random, but at least two attacks appear to have been carefully aimed. On June 28, shells were fired into the local stadium while refugees from outlying towns were being processed there, killing two of them. A week later, four residents were killed while waiting in line to buy food at Bihac's only functioning store.\nThe United Nations headquarters was moved out of the center of town last month, Major Haider said, after a bombing attack in which three children in an adjoining building were killed.\nBihac sits in a fertile valley only a few miles from Bosnia's border with Croatia. Serbs control the regions of Croatia that are north and west of here and also dominate rugged Bosnian hills to the south and east. Some Supplies Get Through\nSupplies sent by the United Nations and the Red Cross, including one convoy that arrived this weekend, are allowed to cross Serbian lines. But relief workers acknowledge that the amount of food and medicine that is arriving here is not nearly enough to meet the needs of such a large population.\nEvidence of the growing isolation of this region is clearly visible in the Bihac Hospital, where doctors have recently begun treating severely malnourished infants.\n\"They look like victims of the Ethiopian famine,\" said Lars Neilsen, a Danish relief worker. \"Pediatricians tell us that many cases don't even make it to the hospital.\"\nThe economy of this region has ground to an almost complete halt, with few crops being harvested and almost no businesses still open. In Bihac, many buildings have been destroyed or damaged by mortar fire. Many of the remaining homes are protected by piles of sandbags or stacks of lumber.\nAlthough other communities in the area are not under the kind of sustained bombardment that faces Bihac, many are suffering. In one typical town, Velika Kladusa, 25 miles north of here, residents are without electric power, telephone service and running water. Food shortages are becoming acute, and residents say several small children have died in recent days because there is no medicine to treat their ailments.\nSerbs who block escape routes from Velika Kladusa have allowed the evacuation of several seriously ill people, but will not permit groups of residents to leave unless the entire population agrees to flee.\nThe local authorities in the town, as in some other nearby communities, have forbidden residents to leave. They fear that if their town is abandoned, residents will never be able to return.\n\"It's like being in jail,\" said Elvira Redzic, 23 years old and a Muslim. \"All the roads are blocked. People don't have enough to eat. The stores are empty. We have no idea what to do.\"\nRelief workers say residents of another Muslim town, Bosanski Novi, are preparing to flee en masse in the face of Serbian attacks and threats.\nBosnian Muslims, many of whom are blond and blue-eyed like their Serbian neighbors, are Western-oriented and have little sympathy for religious fundamentalism. Many say they are shocked at the vehemence with which Serbs are now attacking them.\n\"It is very hard to fight them because they are like brothers to us,\" said Hakija Zolic, an electrical engineer who had joined the heavily out-gunned Bosnian Army. \"We will never surrender.\""}, {"text": "Abolish the Disaster Agency\n1992-09-06T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency's lackluster response to Hurricane Andrew makes it painfully clear that the agency should be abolished.\nIn theory, the management agency is responsible for coordinating the Government's response to domestic emergencies. In reality, it has little practical authority to carry out Presidential priorities -- particularly when it tries to coordinate with much larger entities, like the Pentagon or the Department of Transportation. Moreover, the agency has become a dumping ground for mediocre political appointees with little background or interest in disaster relief. In fact, its ratio of political appointees to career professionals is the highest in the Government.\nThe U.S. used to have an effective crisis-management organization. The Office of Emergency Preparedness was in the White House. Its director, a member of the National Security Council, reported directly to the President. The office handled domestic disasters, as well as national security emergencies (like industrial sabotage) and economic crises (like carrying out a wage and price freeze).\nBut in 1973 the office was abolished, a victim of a political skirmish in the Nixon Administration. Its national security functions were moved to the General Services Administration, while its disaster management responsibilities were transferred to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nIn 1978, Jimmy Carter put crisis-management responsibilities back under one roof when he created the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But the agency's record has been less than inspiring. Delays plagued its responses to recent disasters -- the San Francisco earthquake in 1989, Hurricane Hugo the same year and Hurricane Bob in 1991. Worse, the rest of the Government doesn't take the agency seriously. Wallace Stickney, its director, was effectively cut out of the decision-making process during Hurricane Andrew.\nThe emergency agency should be scrapped and replaced with a smaller, highly professional office. The new agency must operate from the White House, and its director must be of Cabinet rank to carry the necessary authority. About 500 professionals (100 in Washington and 400 in the field) would constitute its nucleus, replacing the current staff of 2,600.\nMoreover, the military should be given responsibility for planning and logistics, coordinating simulations of disaster conditions much as it conducts military exercises. Bases across the country would serve as centers for water, food and medical supplies and as temporary shelters. A military official of lieutenant general rank should be made director of operations for the agency to strengthen ties with the Pentagon.\nDuring the cold war, it did not make much sense for the military to take on domestic disasters. The Pentagon could not afford to have Army divisions tied down in Florida if the Soviet Union tried to break through NATO defenses in Germany.\nBut now fewer troops need to be stationed abroad. Giving the military responsibility for disaster relief would not only be good for the country, it would be good for the troops, giving them a meaningful mission to maintain their cutting edge. Our armed forces know how to deal with disasters, as they demonstrated in Somalia and Bangladesh. And they would be particularly adept at responding to the man-made disasters of the future: techno-terrorist attacks that could paralyze the entire country.\nIf the Administration is really serious about reducing the size of Government, it would replace the Federal Emergency Management Agency with a streamlined crisis-management organization agile enough to provide disaster relief immediately -- and not a few days later."}, {"text": "Researchers Report Much Grimmer AIDS Outlook\n1992-06-04T05:00:00.000Z\nThe worldwide epidemic of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, threatens to infect 40 million to 110 million people by 2000, and international efforts to stop the spread of the fatal disease have stalled, a leading AIDS research group said yesterday.\nThe conclusions, compiled by 40 experts and researchers from around the world, are far grimmer than those of the World Health Organization, which predicts, at most, 40 million H.I.V.-infected people by 2000.\nDr. Michael Merson, who heads the AIDS program at the health organization, said its estimates were based on government reports. Many countries suppress reports about AIDS and other diseases, but Dr. Merson said his group would stand by its estimates.\nThe new projections, by a group led by Dr. Jonathan Mann of the Harvard School of Public Health, are based on interviews with experts and analysis of hundreds of programs around the world. Many in the group have been forceful advocates of greater efforts to prevent the spread of the disease.\nThe World Health Organization \"is underestimating both the scope of the problem and what will be needed in order to deal with the problem,\" Dr. Mann said at a news conference in Washington yesterday.\nNo country or community has stopped the spread of H.I.V., the human immunodeficiency virus, and it is spreading with \"astounding rapidity\" in many areas of the world, he added.\nEven simple things that can be done to prevent the spread are not being done, said Dr. Mann, who formerly headed the global AIDS program at the World Health Organization.\nFor example, he said, huge numbers of blood transfusions are being given in many developing countries without any effort to screen the blood for the virus, though tests to do so have been available for seven years. Appeal for New Strategy\nHealth officials have not systematically analyzed the hundreds of programs around the world to identify what works in checking spread of the virus, Dr. Mann said.\nThese alarming findings are reported in the coalition's book, \"AIDS in the World 1992,\" to be published by Harvard University Press later this year. The report urges world leaders to develop a new strategy to cope with the worldwide epidemic.\nDr. Merson responded that the annual meeting of W.H.O. last month had adopted \"a new global AIDS strategy\" that gives countries a framework for battling the epidemic. Details of Epidemic\nBut Dr. Mann said the World Health Organization, as an agency of the United Nations, is vulnerable to political pressure from member nations. By contrast, he added, the group he heads is financed by a private Swiss foundation, the Association Francois-Xavier Bagnoud, and its members are freer to speak out.\nThe book, edited by Dr. Mann and Dr. Daniel Tarantola and Thomas W. Netter, who are with the International AIDS Center at Harvard, offers these conclusions:\n*AIDS is having a growing impact on women, who now account for 40 percent of H.I.V. infections worldwide, up from 25 percent in 1990.\n*AIDS is exploding in Southeast Asia, and by 2000 Asia will overtake Africa with the largest proportion of H.I.V.-infected persons. Asia will account for 42 percent, sub-Saharan Africa for 31 percent, Latin America for 8 percent and the Caribbean for 6 percent.\n*During the next three years alone, the number of infected people who develop AIDS will exceed the total who developed the disease during the entire history of the epidemic.\n*By early 1992, at least 12.9 million people had been infected with H.I.V., including 7.1 million men, 4.7 million women and 1.1 million children. One in five developed AIDS and nearly 2.5 million have died. About 100,000 people now have AIDS.\n*The number of children orphaned by AIDS will more than double in the next three years.\n*A survey of 38 countries showed that one-third of the leaders had never spoken about AIDS; another third had spoken occasionally and only since 1989.\nThe major impact of AIDS is yet to come, Dr. Mann said. During the next decade, H.I.V. is likely to reach most communities in the world and \"the question is not if AIDS will strike, but only when,\" he said.\nThe coalition noted that there are wide variations in the impact of the disease from region to region, and even area to area within a country.\nThe group deplored what it called the \"enormous discrepancies between funding for AIDS work in industrialized and developing countries.\" It noted that no country had made AIDS a health priority and that there had been a substantial turnover in senior leadership of AIDS workers in many countries. Not Enough Money\nIn 1990 and 1991, the coalition said, about 6 percent of the worldwide spending for AIDS prevention was in the developing countries that accounted for more than 80 percent of all H.I.V. infections.\nIn 1991, the United States spent $2.70 per person and Europeans $1.18 for AIDS prevention, compared with 7 cents per person in sub-Sahara Africa and 3 cents in Latin America.\nTreatment for AIDS is largely the privilege of the industrialized countries, the coalition said. Still, the report said, from 40,000 to 80,000 people are expected to develop H.I.V. infections in the United States this year. In Europe, 75,000 people became infected last year.\nIn 1985-91, the researchers found, industrialized countries spent about $780 million for AIDS prevention and care in the developing world. But they are turning away from coordinated efforts to work through bilateral agreements with developing countries, the coalition said. It said it would be much more efficient to channel donations through an agency like the World Health Organization. The Human Rights Issue\nThe coalition stressed that the \"rights of people with H.I.V. remain in grave peril.\" More than 50 countries have imposed restrictions on travel and immigration of people with H.I.V. and AIDS, and international efforts to roll back such legislation have stalled, the coalition said.\nOne reason for such travel controls is the high risk that 57 countries face of an explosive spread of H.I.V., including such densely populated nations as Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Nigeria and Pakistan.\nDr. Mann said that the scores of programs aimed at stopping the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus were incomplete \"because they have not considered what they could have learned from programs in other parts of the world to see what works, evaluate it, and then spread the information around.\" 'So Much Waste'\nDr. Mann said, \"There is no document saying, here is what is essential to all programs.\" Instead, \"there is so much waste, so much reinvention of the wheel.\"\n\"The world is still handicapped in the battle against AIDS,\" he concluded, \"by debating whether it is O.K. to distribute condoms, exchange needles, give sex education, whether people with AIDS deserve care that they obviously deserve.\""}, {"text": "On My Mind; Letter To Two Men\n1992-02-11T05:00:00.000Z\nSince this column is written on the chance that it will come to the attention of President Bush or Secretary of State James Baker, it is addressed directly to them, with hope.\nDear Mr. President and Mr. Secretary,\nIn your time in office, both of you have taken part in operations of rescue for which you neither asked nor received a great deal of credit.\nAs just one instance, the President helped the airlift of Ethiopian Jews to Israel. As another, the Secretary used his talents and strengths and those of some of his best officers to bring about the release of prisoners held in the Soviet gulag. There were other cases of which I am aware and I am sure that there are some of which I know nothing.\nComing from a frequent critic of the Administration's foreign policy this acknowledgment may be construed as having an ulterior motive, which is absolutely correct. The motive is to urge you to take a personal new look at the disaster that has befallen the people of Haiti and to do for them what you did for some other victims of repression.\nThis tragedy is not simply on our doorstep, but right in our own house. It is there that the Haitians seek succor, no place else. Tens of millions of Americans understand this in their souls because it was to this one blessed country that their fathers and mothers fled, and to no other.\nIt is in our house because thousands are here already or under our protection at Guantanamo. And, as you know, their suffering is ours to deal with now because you have inherited it from decisions of previous American Administrations to arm and help maintain in power the killer regimes of Haiti that have brought its people to desperation -- Duvalier, father and son, and the thugs who surrounded and succeeded them.\nDespite our problems, we still say and still believe that we are ready to help those who seek freedom. We still are capable of doing so. If this cannot be done with people already in our house physically and morally, what will we be saying to the world, and what to ourselves?\nAmericans know the problems involved. Some Haitians perhaps do not fit the strict definition of political refugee needed for acceptance but are \"only\" refugees in the \"economic\" sense -- from starvation. We know that the U.S. cannot accept all foreigners who wish to live here -- although immigrants' children, like myself, struggle against the idea of denying others the gift of America that we received.\nI do not talk about money. Americans are no less generous than Pakistanis who accepted millions of Afghan refugees, and shared with them, or the people of dirt-poor Bangladesh, where desperate sufferers have fled the Burmese dictators.\nWe know that the Administration has not shown a heart and face of stone, but has accepted as refugees about a fourth of the Haitians who fled here.\nBut 10,000 more already here or at Guantanamo will be sent back to danger. They are being forced to return to a country whose rulers have endowed it with nothing but terror. These people, strong and brave enough to flee in small boats, will pay in blood when they are forced back -- pay at once or pay tomorrow when the world takes its attention off Haiti and the police gangsters can beat, torture and kill at will once again.\nSo is this not truly the time to remove technicalities and restrictions confining the generosity and compassion of our country to these people?\nThe President is enabled to use disaster-relief powers. Rarely has a greater disaster been visited upon neighbors. And what relief has meaning other than allowing them to stay in safety -- until they can have reasonable assurance that they can return in peace and decency?\nWould Americans turn away, Mr. President, if you told them directly that you were stepping in to preserve the lives of neighbors, and the name of America?\nThe contrary -- I think that would be received with acclaim, most particularly by the great variety of Roman Catholic community and church organizations and the Protestant and Jewish groups that already work and give for the Haitians.\nAnd nothing would better explain why the name of this country always has meant so very much to so very many beyond its borders, and still does."}, {"text": "THE WORLD; Somali Culture Holds Surprises, Some Pleasant, For American G.I.'s\n1992-12-27T05:00:00.000Z\nMARINE Cpl. Charles Cox landed here expecting to see starving children in a grim tableau of misery and death. In his first week, though, Corporal Cox drove by lush farms and grazing land for cattle and other livestock that rivaled the richest countryside near his hometown, Mobile, Ala.\n\"We didn't expect to see camels and cornfields,\" said the 23-year-old infantryman. For thousands of young American marines and soldiers in the military relief operation here -- many serving on their first overseas mission -- the reality of Somalia has differed sharply from their expectations.\nSince the Vietnam War, in which American commanders learned hard lessons about insensitivity toward the citizens of an occupied land, the military has worked hard to prepare its grunts for the cultures they will encounter in overseas operations. But most young troops interviewed in the first two weeks of the Somalia operation said there were some things here that they had to learn firsthand.\nThe soldiers expected to see poverty, but not the large number of seemingly healthy people they also encountered. Somalia is a Muslim country, but the forces here have been able to quietly observe Christmas and Hanukkah with none of the religious restrictions encountered in Saudi Arabia during the Persian Gulf war.\nMarines were prepared to engage guerrillas in battle, but so far have seen little action and suffered few casualties (the first American fatality occurred last week, a civilian Army worker killed by a mine). Scattered potshots from snipers are about the extent of the opposition encountered by the troops, as well as gunfire from 10-year-olds with AK-47 assault rifles, usually aimed harmlessly into the air. American troops had heard of Somalia's culture of guns, but in the initial days of the military relief operation, before gunmen largely retreated from the streets of Mogadishu, they were shocked at how young and cocky those with guns were.\nThe American troops say their attitude toward their mission hasn't changed -- they still want to help. But immersed in the chaos that long ago replaced a working government, soldiers and marines say it will take much more than delivering tons of food to solve Somalia's problems in the long run.\n\"Once you get here, you understand why you're here,\" said Cpl. Norman Finley, 22, a gulf war veteran from Rio Vista, Tex.\nBefore they arrived, marines heading to Somalia aboard ships were given magazine articles and briefings on the country. Cpl. Larry Abeyta, 25, an anti-tank gunner from Redondo Beach, Calif., took a cultural geography course offered on the dock-landing ship Rushmore. Cpl. Greg Bernhardt, 21, a radio operator from East Northport, L.I., brushed up on the Somali words for \"halt\" and \"Are you in pain?\" from a military handout. Many others summoned their experience from recent relief missions in Kurdistan, Bangladesh and the Philippines.\nBut the unexpected greeted marines from the moment photographers blinded camouflaged scouts storming Mogadishu's beach. The marines came ashore unsure what, if any, opposition they might face. So far, random snipers, working mainly after dark, have been errant but still unnerving. Reading Expressions\nBehind the heavy, double-metal gates of the United States Embassy, marine and Army sentries say they have had to become quick judges of character. \"You can tell which ones need help and which ones are gang members by the expressions in their faces,\" said Corporal Finley. \"During the day they are your friends, and at night some of them are the snipers shooting around you.\"\nIn those same faces, American troops say, they see little of the debilitating hunger that camera crews captured regularly for the evening news last summer. Instead, many soldiers have had to contend with the crowds of curious and frequently exuberant Somalis thronging around foot patrols and armed vehicles.\nAs the military operation gradually expands into Somalia's famine belt, many marines are surprisingly unaware of the steady efforts of private relief agencies who have continued to deliver supplies in the most violent situations. Other scenes of abject poverty, though, burn into soldiers' memories. Pfc. Jason Karger, 19, an Army cook from Duluth, Minn., said he realized the state of living conditions and health education here when he saw a woman casually ladle out a drink for herself from a metal basin in which she was bathing her baby.\n\"I heard it was bad, but I didn't know it was this bad all around,\" said Cpl. Greg Riles, 22, of Riverside, Calif., as he shooed away a pack of kids who tried to snatch food remains from a burning garbage heap. The kids evidently lived in a ramshackle corrugated metal lean-to nearby.\nThe marines, supplied with M.R.E.'s -- meals-ready-to-eat -- have often been reluctant to eat in front of Somalis.\n\"It gets so bad you won't eat on the top of your amtrak in front of the kids,\" said Lance Cpl. Jim Dufault, a 20-year-old amphibious track driver from Haverhill, Mass. \"I'd rather be inside the track with the flies. It makes me feel really bad.\"\nIn some instances, a rapport is slowly building as sign language and the Somalis' generally receptive attitude toward the troops bridge the language gap.\n\"No matter how badly they live, they are very proud,\" said Lance Cpl. David Ferguson, 21, of Denver, Colo. \"You can tell just talking to them. They not afraid or intimidated by us.\"\nSomalis have distinctly different reactions to black troops, who make up about 21 percent of the American force here.\nMost Somalis seem to welcome the black troops and the order they have helped to impose, although some of the young gunmen disarmed by the marines, perhaps in a reflection of their bitterness, have been critical of the American blacks.\nBlack marines said they seemed to be regarded either as heroes or reviled for fighting with a white-led occupying force. \"When they saw me, they'd yell, 'Hey, Mike Tyson,' \" said Pfc. Walter Hughes, a 19-year-old cook from Detroit. \"They'd all be smiling.\"\nBut Cpl. Kerry Freeman, a 22-year-old rifleman from Sandersville, Ga., said Somalis had lectured him about the mistreatment of blacks in America. They would \"tell me all about how blacks got to America as slaves,\" he said. \"But then I'd tell them about Malcolm X and Martin Luther King.\"\nLance Cpl. Allen Robinson, a 20-year-old machine-gunner from Amityville, N.Y., said: \"They see me working side-by-side with white guys and many of them don't understand. They think you're no good and that you're there to fight them.\n\"I tell them, 'I'm African-American and you're Somali, but we're the same.' Still, it hurts when they say, 'You're no good,' and I'm here doing my job trying to help them.\""}, {"text": "Burmese, After Years of Terror, Hope Things May Soon Change for the Better\n1992-04-29T05:00:00.000Z\nFor many of the people of Yangon, the faded capital of a nation better known to the world as Burma, the best they could muster this week was a muted, wary optimism that maybe something might change.\n\"We do not know what to believe, whether this junta could ever tell the truth,\" said a 26-year-old painter, asked about the announcement by the military Government that it would release political prisoners and would allow family members to visit the nation's Nobel-prize winning dissident, Aung San Suu Kyi. \"Optimism is a luxury.\"\nAfter hopes for a democratic Myanmar were brutally crushed by the junta when it ignored election results in 1990 and jailed and tortured many of the winning candidates, optimism, he said, is a thing still easily smothered by fear.\nForeign diplomats in Yangon, formerly Rangoon, admit they are also puzzled by elements of the Government's decree. They say there is great -- and justifiable -- suspicion over the motives of the soldier who now appears to be running the country, Maj. Gen. Khin Nyunt, the 52-year-old director of Myanmar's secret police. Pictures of Prisoners\nIn tea houses and noodle stands along the steamy, tree-shaded sidestreets of Yangon, formerly Rangoon, people this week have been hunched over copies of the Government newspaper, The Working People's Daily, to study the grainy photographs of the 19 political prisoners who have been released so far.\n\"She looks very thin,\" said a shopkeeper eating breakfast at a noodle stand on Pansodan Street, pointing to the photograph of Ma Theingi, a writer who was Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's personal assistant. On Sunday, Ms. Theingi was released from detention in Yangon's notorious Insein Prison.\nBetween spoonfuls of an aromatic noodle soup flavored with banana stem and a sprinkling of fried garlic, the shopkeeper looked at the photograph again and again.\n\"Mah Theingi is not smiling in the photograph,\" he said. \"The other political prisoners are smiling. Why isn't Mah Theingi smiling? Perhaps she knows this is a trick. We all hope these developments mean more openness. But we all know this could be a trick.\"\nThe shopkeeper and a group of friends stopped their loud chattering -- their faces froze, in fact -- when a Western reporter, traveling in Myanmar on a tourist visa since journalists are officially banned from the country, asked them about the soldier whose picture appeared on the front page of the newspaper, General Khin Nyunt.\n\"This man is very powerful,\" whispered one of the friends, brave enough to say something about General Khin Nyunt but not brave enough to actually utter his name in a place where strangers might be listening. Informers working for the general's secret police are thought to be everywhere.\nSeveral Western and Asian diplomats in Yangon say they believe that General Khin Nyunt engineered the moves that began Thursday night with the announcement that the chairman of the junta, General Saw Maung, had stepped down because of ill health.\nHis health problems were not specified in the announcement, although diplomats say that the 64-year-old general suffered a nervous breakdown.\nLast December, as he was about to tee off at a golf tournament, he reportedly started screaming, for no apparent reason, \"I am the great King Kyanzittha! I am great King Kyanzittha!\" a reference to a monarch of the ancient Pagan empire. At recent public gatherings, he has been incoherent. Known as Slorc\nThe junta calls itself the State Law and Order Restoration Council and is better known by Myanmar's large English-speaking population by the acronym Slorc.\n\"Essentially, Khin Nyunt is running Slorc,\" said a Western diplomat.\n\"Saw Maung seems to have been the bottleneck to progress,\" said another diplomat. \"Khin Nyunt is no angel, of course. But he seems to be much more pragmatic, more sophisticated than his colleagues. He knows that something has to be done to prevent Burma from being isolated any further in the international community.\"\n[ That isolation eased some on Tuesday when Myanmar's Foreign Minister and his Bangladesh counterpart signed an agreement under which Myanmar will accept the return of thousands of Burmese Muslims who fled across the border since early 1991, charging they were driven out of Myanmar, which is predominantly Buddhist. More than 200,000 Burmese Muslims are now in living in squalid camps in Bangladesh. ] Power Believed to Be Shared\nOthers in diplomatic circles say that General Khin Nyunt's power is still far from absolute, and that his authority is shared with other generals, most notably Than Shwe, who is now the junta's titular chairman, and Ne Win, the architect of the 1962 coup that began three decades of xenophobic authoritarian rule in Myanmar.\nAmong those freed last weekend was the nation's last democratically elected Prime Minister, 85-year-old U Nu, who had been held under house arrest since December 1989. He was reported by his family to be in good health.\nTo no one's surprise in Yangon, the order did not include Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, the charismatic leader of Myanmar's pro-democracy movement and the dissident whom junta members often angrily refer to in their speeches simply as \"that woman.\"\nThe daughter of Aung San, the nation's founder, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi has been held under house arrest in Yangon since July 1989. Last year she was awarded the Noble Peace Prize for her nonviolent campaign to bring democracy to Myanmar.\nOn Saturday, it was announced that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's British husband and their two children would be allowed to meet with her for the first time in more than two years. Could Remain a Prisoner\nThere has been no suggestion that she will be released anytime soon from her family's gracious lakeside home on Yangon's University Avenue, and diplomats say that unless she agrees to leave Myanmar and renounce politics -- something she has refused to do -- Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi could remain a prisoner of the junta for years.\nAs the head of the nation's secret police, the Directorate of the Defense Services Intelligence, General Khin Nyunt is thought to be well aware of, if not actually directing, the Government-sanctioned torture and killing of junta opponents allied with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi.\nIn its 1991 report on international human rights practices, the State Department found credible evidence \"to suggest a number of civilian deaths at the hands of government officials or soldiers\" in Myanmar, and that political opponents were routinely tortured by methods that included electric shock, cigarette burns, suffocation and sleep and food deprivation. -------------------- Military Operations to Stop\nBANGKOK, Thailand, April 28 (Special to The New York Times) -- The military government of Myanmar, formerly Burma, announced today that it would suspend military operations against the nation's best-armed rebel group in hopes of negotiatiating a peaceful settlement to an insurgency that began more than four decades ago.\nThe announcement, carried on Myanmar's state radio, amounted to an admission that Government troops would be unable to overrun the ethnic Karen rebels during the dry season, which ends in a few weeks.\nEarlier in the year, the junta vowed that it would take the Karen headquarters, Manerplaw, by March 27, Armed Services Day. It missed that deadline, although Government forces did capture several other Karen strongholds in fierce battles."}, {"text": "Saving the Earth From Roasting\n1992-06-05T05:00:00.000Z\nIs there yet time to save Earth from a catastrophic roasting that some experts now regard as virtually inevitable? A new show at the American Museum of Natural History offers a rare opportunity for visitors to crystallize their thinking about this monstrous prospect.\nThe museum and its partner in the project, the Environmental Defense Fund, recently opened a spectacular exhibition aimed not only at demonstrating the possibly imminent danger of global warming, but also at suggesting the possibility of salvation, provided that people everywhere begin pitching in.\nThe show, \"Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast,\" occupies a substantial part of the museum's third floor and cost $3.7 million, making it one of the most expensive and elaborate temporary exhibitions the institution has mounted. It also breaks new ground.\n\"By attempting to look into the future, this exhibition is clearly different from anything we've done in the past,\" said Dr. George D. Langdon Jr., the museum's president. \"We're not an advocacy organization, but our department heads agree that it's important for people to understand the scientific questions involved in the threat of global warming. We also believe that steps should be taken before it's too late.\" A World Debate\nNational leaders are meeting in Rio de Janeiro this week to consider environmental issues, and although many agree that urgent action is needed to head off global warming, President Bush, a participant in the meeting, does not. Mr. Bush's Administration contends that international regulations limiting the amount of carbon dioxide industries may emit would be enormously costly and not justified by the meager evidence that the world has already begun to warm up.\nWhile rancorous debate among experts has not resolved this question, no one disputes the fact that carbon dioxide levels have been rising rapidly in this century and that at least in theory, their continued increase could cause global warming of up to 8 degrees in the 21st century.\nThe effects of the carbon dioxide may be offset, of course, by increased cloud cover reflecting sunlight away from Earth or by increased levels of sulfur dioxide produced by volcanoes (which increases cloud cover), or by many other mechanisms scientists have hypothesized -- none of them well understood.\nBut in some worst-case predictions, global warming could rapidly melt polar ice, raising sea levels and inundating Bangladesh, Venice and countless other places. The world's great granaries -- America's Midwest, Ukraine, Argentina and other regions -- might become arid semi-desert land, with incalculable effects on global food supplies.\nA strength of the new exhibition is its wealth of displays clearly explaining some of the scientific methods and gadgets used to study Earth's climate. With money from Shearson Lehman Brothers, the National Science Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation and Turner Broadcasting Systems, the project was able to splurge on unusually elaborate displays.\nFor example, scientists seeking to calculate how carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere may have raised or lowered global temperatures in the past base some of their calculations on the study of ice buried deep in the Greenland and Antarctic ice caps. Ice core samples brought to the surface by drilling machines are windows into the past.\nThe age of such a sample can be determined accurately from its depth and the chemical and physical composition of its layers. Best of all, an ice-cap sample contains myriad tiny, highly compressed air bubbles trapped intact since the ice froze.\n\"Fossil\" air in these tiny bubbles is immensely valuable to scientists. Not only does an ancient air bubble reveal how much carbon dioxide the atmosphere contained at a specific time in the past, but also oxygen isotopes trapped in the bubbles indicate the temperature of the atmosphere at that time as well. Greenland Ice and Cows\nThe display includes a freezer with a large window, through which viewers can look at a big chunk of real Greenland ice clouded by tiny bubbles of 660-year-old air.\nAnother eye-catcher is a model cow equipped with a gut represented by a twisted neon tube and a speaker emitting recorded cow burps. The point of the display is that hoofed animals digesting vegetable fodder burp enormous amounts of methane, which, with carbon dioxide, is one of the most potent \"greenhouse\" gases -- gases that prevent the sun's radiant energy from being reflected back into space. Cattle, mainstays of rural economies throughout the world, may be adding to the greenhouse problem.\nAn elderly woman said to a companion with whom she had just toured the exhibits: \"This is just horrifying. I had no idea Earth was in such trouble. I'm so glad we came.\"\nThe climate debate is far from over, and to their credit, the museum and the Environmental Defense Fund offer viewers an assortment of dissenting views. Explanatory panels and interactive computer programs point out, for instance, that climate temperature varies widely and randomly, and that although the past decade has been unusually warm, the degree of warming is within the normal range of variability.\nThe museum and the Environmental Defense Fund might have skirted the contentious issue of birth control but chose instead to show how unchecked population growth is closely linked to carbon dioxide production and greenhouse warming. One display panel states that \"to create a sustainable global society, we must both conserve our resources and stabilize population size\" -- a view shared by most scientists but not by the Vatican, by many third world governments or by the Bush Administration.\n\"Our trustees properly insisted that we address this issue,\" Dr. Langdon said. \"We've tried to do that without shaking our fingers at anyone.\"\nDespite the publicity lavished on environmental problems in recent years, many people remain confused by or ignorant of the complicated facts and can benefit from guidance offered by the show, said Dr. Samuel M. Taylor, the museum's director of exhibitions.\nThe most common misconception, he said, is mistaking greenhouse warming (caused largely by carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) with the ozone hole (a completely different phenomenon probably caused by the release of chlorofluorocarbon compounds into the upper atmosphere).\nWhether for education or the pleasure of strolling through an exceptionally well-conceived museum exhibition, \"Global Warming\" is worth an hour's visit. . . . Where to Learn More\nThe show on global warming will remain at the American Museum of Natural History, at Central Park West and 79th Street in Manhattan, through Jan. 19, after which it will tour these museums:\nLos Angeles County Natural History Museum (April 3 to July 25, 1993)\nCarnegie Science Center, Pittsburgh (Sept. 24, 1993, to Feb. 13, 1994)\nMilwaukee Public Museum (April 15, 1994, to Sept. 5, 1994)\nDenver Museum of Natural History (Nov. 4, 1994, to March 26 1995)\nSt. Louis Science Center (May 26, 1995, to Oct. 15, 1995)\nNational Museum of Natural History in Washington (Dec. 15, 1995, to May 5, 1996)\nOn weekdays, the exhibition is usually crowded with school groups, but museum officials say it is much quieter on Friday and Saturday evenings. On those days the museum is open from 10 A.M. until 8:45 P.M. On other days it is open from 10 A.M. until 5:45 P.M. Suggested museum admission: $5 for adults and $2.50 for children.

Attention to symptoms and avoidance of causes is invariably more pronounced among those who are so comfortable that change seems threatening than among those who have so little that change can only be for the better. Herein lie seeds of discord that could disable global action for survival.\nThe question of consumption is central to the environmental crisis. It is the human impact that is endangering the planet's capacity to sustain life. The human impact stems mainly from people's use, or waste, of energy and raw materials - and that varies vastly.\nA quarter of the world's people, most of them in industrial countries, account for 80 percent of commercial energy consumption; 20 percent goes to the remaining three-quarters of mankind, mainly in poor nations.\nOn average, each person in a developed nation consumes 18 times the energy used by a person in a developing country. The high energy consumption of the rich causes vastly more pollution than the low consumption of the poor. Carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is a major factor in environmental stress. Each North American produces 10 times as much carbon dioxide as each inhabitant of South or East Asia, excluding Japan.\nThe impact of industrial states on the biosphere can only be lowered if they reduce their consumption of energy and other resources. With determined effort, much can be done in this direction. Unfortunately, some of the big energy users have actually been increasing their per capita energy consumption.\nThe real reductions in per capita consumption of commercial energy since 1970 have been in poor nations, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America - not as a matter of virtue but as population growth has outstripped economic growth.\nThe environmental crisis affects both developed and developing countries. But they face it from very different economic experiences and with vastly different capacities. The crisis is thus likely to be perceived quite differently, with potentially serious consequences for North-South relations.\nThe industrialized nations of the West enjoyed a period of remarkable prosperity in the 1980s. This created many undesirable environmental side effects, but it also provided the resources to tackle the problems. The more environmentally aware states have achieved measurably cleaner air, soil and water.\nThis contrasts sharply with the position of many developing nations, where poverty increased in the 1980s and where, for hundreds of millions of people, life has long been a struggle for survival.\nWhen governments have to cope with heavy debt burdens, low commodity prices and protectionist barriers, sustainable development with due care for the environment becomes a distant objective. Poverty and degradation of the environment are now inextricably linked in a chain of cause and effect.\nSome of the demands being made by affluent states - the preservation of tropical forests, for example, or the linking of aid and trade to environmental standards - provoke genuine fear in developing countries. The idea that poor nations should forsake opportunities for growth in order to attack problems caused largely by the imprudence and profligacy of the rich is often seen as an attempt to preserve the global distribution of wealth and power.\nThe clamor in industrialized states for a ban on tropical hardwood is a case in point. There has been serious overexploitation of some tropical forests, and forestry industries must be subjected to economic disciplines leading to sustainable use. But to focus on this issue is to neglect the far more serious problem of forests retreating as growing numbers of poor people seek land for farming and grazing, and wood for fuel. This trend will probably accelerate if the trade in timber ceases to provide export income needed by developing nations to meet basic needs.\nThe United Nations Development Program and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimate that eight times as much wood is removed from forests to provide fuel for poor families as for use by loggers.\nFocusing on logging involves the relatively easy task of lecturing developing nations. Tackling the real problems involves the West in reducing commercial energy consumption and alleviating poverty in the developing world through development programs.\nYet developing nations cannot ignore some forbidding issues. The counterpoint to consumption among the rich could well be population growth among the poor. Rapid population growth in areas where resources are scarce compounds the difficulties of development. For example, in Bangladesh - where millions live precariously on mudbanks facing imminent disaster - the population is expected to double, to 220 million, in the next 35 years, even assuming that the birth rate is halved.\nUnless developed states are willing to do much more to alleviate the burden of poverty, many developing nations will not move beyond their current hand-to-mouth existence.\nThis is a crucial time. If Western countries spurn the cries for help from the poor nations or treat the issues of environment, poverty and development in a parochial, self-serving manner, they could reap a bitter harvest.\nThis is adapted from an address given by Mr. Ramphal Thursday at a conference on business and the environment in Asia and the Pacific. The conference, which ends Friday, is organized by the International Herald Tribune."}, {"text": "Germany Chides Europe About Balkan Refugees\n1992-07-29T05:00:00.000Z\nGerman leaders are increasingly upset at their European partners for refusing to accept larger numbers of refugees from the former Yugoslavia, and will use a refugee conference in Geneva this week to urge them to change their policies.\nBut several governments, including those of France and Britain, have rejected Germany's criticism and indicated they are not willing to admit many more Balkan refugees.\nThe debate reflects the difficulty European countries have in coordinating their policies despite their efforts to move toward unity. In Germany, prominent politicians have begun using unusually blunt language to condemn the refugee policies of allied governments. German Minister 'Furious'\nForeign Minister Klaus Kinkel introduced a resolution at a meeting of European Community foreign ministers this month that would have committed each of the 12 member countries to accept more refugees from the Balkans. His motion failed on a 6-to-6 vote, and Mr. Kinkel said afterward he was \"undiplomatically furious.\"\n\"This has to be a central issue at the refugee conference in Geneva,\" Mr. Kinkel said in an interview with the newspaper Bild am Sonntag. \"All E.C. nations must do their part by accepting refugees. That is what the citizens of these nations want. The governments must follow suit.\"\nMembers of the German Parliament from all parties have joined in criticizing the governments of neighboring countries. Kohl Makes Public Appeal\n\"It is hardhearted and unfriendly for countries like England, France or the Benelux nations to refuse to take refugees,\" said Olaf Feldmann of the centrist Free Democratic party. \"Their attitude shows that the European solidarity we hear so much about is really an empty farce.\"\nOn Friday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl took the unusual step of publicly appealing to the leaders of all European Community nations to open their borders to Balkan refugees.\n\"I consider it extremely important that all European Community member states accept refugees from the former Yugoslavia for a limited time,\" Mr. Kohl wrote in a letter made public by his office. \"The task before us cannot be done if only a few members of the community participate.\"\nThe conference in Geneva, which is to open on Wednesday, was convened by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata. She has been urging European leaders to accept more Balkan refugees.\n\"Little Malawi, a barren African country with eight million inhabitants, sheltered nearly one million people during the war in Mozambique,\" Mrs. Ogata wrote in an article published on the front page of Die Zeit, Germany's leading intellectual weekly. \"Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries in the world, has opened its doors to 300,000 people who have fled from Burma. Does Europe have less to share than these countries?\" 2 Million Displaced by War\nAs many as two million or more citizens of Balkan republics have been displaced by the fighting that broke out there last year, but most remain inside the borders of the former Yugoslavia.\nOf the 425,000 who have managed to flee beyond those borders, Germany has accepted more than 200,000. Austria and Hungary have taken more than 50,000 each, Sweden nearly 45,000, and Switzerland about 17,500.\nBut according to a list issued today by the United Nations refugee commission, other European countries lag far behind. France and Britain have accepted fewer than 1,200 refugees each. Belgium and Finland have taken fewer than 1,000, Spain has admitted 120 and Greece has accepted 7.\nBritish officials have said they believe refugees should be housed as near to their country of origin as possible. They say Britain is too distant. French Suggest Safe Havens\nIn France, military officers have suggested creating safe havens for refugees within the former Yugoslavia, similar to those established to protect Kurds in northern Iraq. They say this would make it unnecessary for citizens to flee the Balkan region.\nForeign Minister Roland Dumas of France has strongly rejected criticism of his Government's policy. \"I am furious about the statements that some 'sympathetic souls' are making on this subject,\" Mr. Dumas said in an interview with France-Soir on Friday.\nGermany was slow to begin accepting refugees from the Balkans, with officials arguing that the country was already being overrun by asylum-seekers from around the world. But great public momentum has built in recent months, and there is widespread support for accepting the refugees here.\nWhen more than 5,000 Bosnian refugees arrived in German cities on Sunday, local citizens converged on train stations to welcome them with flowers and give them packages of food and clothing. Some have offered to accept refugees in their homes.\nPublic pressure is moving some governments to act. Luxembourg has expressed a willingness to accept more refugees, and Denmark said today that it would accept 1,000 in addition to the 1,600 already there."}, {"text": "Kuwait City Journal; With a Bang! Bang! Bang! War Cleanup Goes On\n1992-10-15T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Persian Gulf war has not ended in the dunes and flatlands that surround Kuwait City.\nExplosions still rock the desert, sending up fireballs and clouds of acrid black smoke. Men still die. And the detritus of battle still lies strewn about in rusting heaps.\nSome 4,000 sappers and laborers comb the desert each day deactivating some of the half-million land mines and tons of munitions believed to have been left behind by retreating Iraqi troops.\nMore than 50 have been killed since the cleanup began, and scores more have been injured, including Kuwait's entire five-member team. The Kuwaiti Government estimates that there have also been 1,500 civilian casualties.\n\"This stuff is very unforgiving,\" said Floyd D. Rockwell, a retired master sergeant in the United States Army.\nAfter the war, Kuwait divided the country into sectors and handed out contracts worth some $1 billion to countries that had backed it against Iraq. The French, British, Americans, Turks, Egyptians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis all have swaths of territory and contracts for two or three years. 'A Lot of Potential'\nSome countries, like Egypt, use soldiers. But others with contracts, like the American company Conventional Munitions Systems and the Turkish company Ictas, hire retired American servicemen who have spent most of their professional lives doing explosive ordnance demolition.\nThese specialists belong to a small, tightly knit fraternity that makes a living cleaning up the mess left by militias and armies around the world.\nWalt Tanner, the program manager for Conventional Munitions Systems, rode down a bumpy dirt road in southern Kuwait talking about business. His jeep passed piles of green Iraqi ammunition boxes, stacks of light brown antitank mines, rows of shells and gutted Soviet-built Iraqi tanks.\n\"You still have mines in what was East Germany, all along where the wall was, and there is Cambodia and Afghanistan,\" he said. \"Someday someone will have to go into Iran and clean up the mess form the war with Iraq, so there's a lot of potential.\"\n\"Nicaragua and El Salvador,\" he added as an afterthought.\nThe air suddenly shook with blasts from munitions being destroyed by sappers. In the distance a plume of black smoke curled upward.\nMr. Tanner parked his jeep next to strands of barbed wire that marked an Iraqi minefield.\nSappers walked slowly through the field, swinging mine detectors back and forth. They wore bomb suits made up of a helmet and a \"last chance\" vest. Each man was followed by a partner. The pairs of men traded positions every half hour.\nGary E. Johnston, who retired from the Navy last December, passed his detector over a mine, and a high-pitched noise came from his apparatus. He knelt, brushed off the sand with a trowel and gingerly lifted a five-pound Italian-made antitank mine out of the ground. He turned it upside down and used the tip of the trowel to deactivate it with a few twists of a screw.\n\"We would all rather work without this suit,\" said Mr. Johnston, a 41-year-old native of Culbertson, Mont. \"It does not give you any kind of security. If one of these mines explodes it will turn you into a pile of mushrooms.\" But the insurance companies insist.\nAbout a third of the 100,000 or so tons of munitions dropped by the allies over Kuwait never exploded, either because they were duds or were swallowed by the sand. When sappers try to deactivate some of these devices, like the V-69 antipersonnel mine, a spiked cone that shoots out trip wires and jumps to waist level before exploding, they have to get down on their stomachs and delicately maneuver a pin into the works.\nThe men, who earn about $90,000 a year, say the best attributes for the work are cool nerves and a nimble step. Calmness Is Essential\nBut most admit that the job is unsettling. \"You have to stay calm,\" said Isaac J. McKeithan, 52, one of the oldest men in the field. \"The shaking comes afterward.\"\nMr. McKeithan, like many of the older specialists, is deaf in one ear and has trouble hearing in the other after decades of blowing up munitions.\n\"When I'm in the fire bunker,\" he said, referring to the shelter the sappers use when they detonate munitions, \"I can protect my hearing and smoke at the same time, since I only have to block one ear.\"\nThe long exposure to the elements have made many shells and mines unstable. A retired bomb disposal instructor working for Conventional Munitions Systems was killed earlier in the year by an artillery shell that exploded with routine handling.\nAnd workers along the border, where Clinton A. Hall, an American, was held by Iraqi forces for three days last week, say Iraqi soldiers frequently fire over their heads.\nThe sappers sometimes stumble onto Iraqi bodies. The companies report the locations to the Kuwaiti authorities, but the remains are rarely picked up.\nGeorge R. Spencer, a retired Army major, stood over the body of an Iraqi soldier, still dressed in his dark green uniform. He flagged the spot with a small red marker.\n\"This is not a good place for an Iraqi,\" he said, \"dead or alive.\""}, {"text": "Peppered With Mines, Awash in Civil War, It Still Is Home for Cambodians\n1992-03-30T05:00:00.000Z\nNearly 370,000 Cambodian refugees living in border camps in Thailand are preparing to return home to a nation that seems ill-prepared to receive them.\nOn Monday, the first 600 refugees are to be placed on United Nations buses and driven across the border into Cambodia, for many the first trip home since Vietnam installed a revolutionary government 13 years ago.\nBut relief workers warn that myriad problems inside Cambodia -- land mines, disease, unpassable roads, banditry, shortages of land and housing, the continuing threat of the Khmer Rouge guerrillas -- may force them to halt the repatriation almost as soon as it begins. Government Attacks Rebels\nEven though a peace settlement was reached last fall, there have been repeated ceasefire violations, and heavy fighting was reported last week north of Phnom Penh between troops of the Vietnamese-installed Cambodian government and the Chinese-backed guerrillas of the Khmer Rouge.\n[ The Government began an army offensive against Khmer Rouge guerrillas in northern-central Cambodia on Sunday, seeking to open a highway that is the only link between Preah Vihear province and the rest of the country, The Associated Press reported from Phnom Penh. But United Nations officials said the fighting would not affect the repatriation effort, which is taking place in the western part of the country, the A.P. said. ]\n\"It's no secret that there are problems,\" said Daniel E. Conway, the Thailand representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which is overseeing the $116 million program to return the refugees.\nIn Site 2, the largest of the border camps, a makeshift city of thatch and bamboo that is home to more than 200,000 Cambodians, the imminent return home has created an anxious climate, a mix of euphoria and fear. Many Are Homesick\nSome refugees say that after so many years in a sealed camp in a foreign land, they are unimaginably homesick, ready to go back to Cambodia whatever the hazards.\n\"Cambodia is my home,\" said Chan Siyoun, a 46-year-old widow from Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, who has lived in Site 2 since 1985. \"This camp is not my home.\n\"My life will begin again when I am back in Phnom Penh, and I want to go there soon,\" she said, scanning a bulletin board on which the United Nations has displayed photographs of the six new reception centers in Cambodia.\nBut for every refugee who wants to go home, there is another, it seems, who wants to stay here, at least until the civil war is truly over.\nMany refugees say that if they find conditions in Cambodia as bleak as rumored, they will quickly try to return to Thailand. 'I Am Scared to Leave'\n\"Everybody I know wants to stay in the camp,\" said Jab Buth, 61, a seamstress who has been told she must pack up her belongings -- three skirts, three blouses, two cooking pots, a few photos of the Thai royal family -- and board a bus on Tuesday. \"I am scared to leave. There is still trouble in Cambodia.\"\nMiss Jab Buth, who fled in 1979 to escape the starvation that nearly killed her and took the lives of several neighbors in her tiny western Cambodian village, is skeletal once again, her skin drawn tight against her tiny frame.\nNow, she says, the explanation for her gaunt appearance is a chronic respiratory disease.\nIn Site 2 there are three hospitals, and drugs and doctors' visits are provided free by relief agencies working with the United Nations. Miss Jab Buth says the doctors have kept her alive.\nBut in Cambodia, she knows, there is almost no medical care, free or otherwise. \"I think life will be very hard there,\" she said, clutching the all-important United Nations pass with her photograph that will, for a time, allow her to receive food and other rations.\nMany Cambodians have lived in camps in Thailand since 1979, when the Vietnamese invaded their country, ousting the Khmer Rouge and setting off yet another civil war, in which the Khmer Rouge sought to retake power.\nThailand was host to Cambodian refugees long before then, however. Thousands fled when the Maoist-inspired Khmer Rouge controlled the Government in a reign of terror from 1975 to 1979. Most of those refugees were eventually resettled in other countries.\nBut in recent years, the United States and other nations have refused to accept any more Cambodians. And Thailand, seeing nowhere else to send them, is eager to shut down the refugee settlements once and for all. Large but Precarious Program\nBeneath signs that read \"Gratitude to Thailand\" in Khmer, Thai and English, the first 70 refugee families, about 600 people, are to board United Nations buses on Monday to take them across the border to a center in Sisophon, where they are to be greeted by Prince Sihanouk, Cambodia's head of state.\nAfter two or three days, the refugees are to be transferred to areas where they have asked to be resettled. In Cambodia, the United Nations plans to provide them with building materials and food. The United Nations is responsible for getting all the Cambodians home in time for elections next spring. Relief officials say it will be the largest repatriation of war refugees since 1971, when hundreds of thousands were uprooted in the Bangladesh war for independence.\n\"That is, if this comes off,\" said a United Nations official involved in the resettlement. \"There is so much that can go wrong. I think, yes, let's begin the resettlement. But it may have to be stopped or curtailed very quickly.\"\nRelief workers say that, under one widely discussed plan, the United Nations will halt the repatriation in mid-April, after the first 10,000 to 15,000 refugees have returned home, and then regroup in hopes of restarting the repatriation later in the year.\nMr. Conway, the United Nations official in Thailand, said he knew of no plan to halt or curtail the repatriation after it begins on Monday. But he and other United Nations officials readily concede there is not enough safe, arable land in Cambodia for all the refugees, and few roads capable of transporting them to areas of the country where the land is available.\nAfter a generation of war and bloodshed, Cambodia is also seeded with land mines, hundreds of thousands of them, perhaps millions. And despite a commitment by the United Nations to provide five acres of unmined farm land to each family, little of that land has been identified so far.\nThe peace treaty granted the refugees the right to choose where they wish to resettle, in part to foil the Khmer Rouge in its plans to coerce some refugees into territory it controls. But that promise created another problem: Nearly 60 percent of the 370,000 refugees have asked to settle in one province, Battambang, directly across the border from Thailand.\nMany refugees originally came from Battambang, but others acknowledge that they requested resettlement in Battambang because it would, if necessary, offer them the quickest route back to safety in Thailand.\nWhile Battambang is among the most affluent provinces in Cambodia because of its border trade and its rich farmland and gem trade, it almost certainly cannot handle so many new residents.\nMany of the refugees also fear that after so many years, they have forgotten the basic farming skills that will allow them to provide for themselves after they return home to Cambodia.\n\"I have not been a farmer for many years, and my children have never seen a farm,\" said Eng Peo, 37, who has raised two children in the camp. \"How do I start again?\""}, {"text": "The Pop Life\n1992-10-14T05:00:00.000Z\nA Big Splash\nHere's how long it took the tribute to Bob Dylan at Madison Square Garden that's scheduled for Friday night, featuring everybody from George Harrison, Eric Clapton and the rock poet himself to members of the group Pearl Jam, to sell out: 70 minutes. That's for 18,200 seats, and each person was allowed to buy only one pair of tickets at a time. The tickets started at $80 for the public and at $150 for industry types. What recession?\n\"We were pleasantly surprised about the response,\" said Kevin Wall, the chairman of Radiovision, the company producing the show. \"The demographic is the same as has been buying back-catalogue records for years and saving the music industry. It's getting people out of the suburbs into cars to go to a concert in New York, which is hard to do. The demand is much greater than the tickets we had, and I think we could have done five nights. To have George and Dylan and Eric, it's magical. I think when value is put out here in the market place, people will buy, even if we're deep in a recession.\"\nStill, $80? Mr. Wall said the concert was costing more than $5 million to produce. There are unions to pay, long rehearsals, the cost of the Garden itself and the cost of housing so many people.\nThe show is to be taped with both high-definition and regular television cameras. It can be seen on pay-per-view cable service at 8:30 for $19.95; it will also be seen around the world, some places live, some with a delay. The press release says half a billion people will watch it, which seems a bit much.\n\"We think we've got a magical moment, like 'The Last Waltz' or 'The Concert for Bangladesh,' so we thought we'd do the absolute best,\" Mr. Wall said. \"We're going to shoot this on high definition, which is very expensive. If you can put four high-definition cameras together you're doing great, and we have eight. That right there doubled the production costs for the TV side.\"\nThe show was the idea of Mr. Dylan's representatives and Columbia Records. Mr. Dylan is a seminal figure in popular culture, even if he now sings like a wounded dog and is long past his prime. He is, inescapably, still a huge draw and has influenced everyone from the Beatles to a whole host of younger performers. Other acts on the bill include Neil Young, Mary-Chapin Carpenter, Johnny Cash, John Mellencamp, Willie Nelson, Sinead O'Connor, Tom Petty, Rosanne Cash, Lou Reed and Shawn Colvin.\nRoger McGuinn, the leader of the Byrds, will also appear, and he owes a good deal of his success to Mr. Dylan. The Byrds' first single, before they signed with Columbia, was Mr. Dylan's \"Mr. Tambourine Man.\"\n\"It's incalculable, his influence has been so great,\" Mr. McGuinn said. \"If he hadn't existed, there might not have been thinking-man's music. In the mid-60's the music might just have stayed bubble gum, all those concepts of his might have been lost. The Beatles were doing straight pop, and Dylan had a talk with Lennon and after that the Beatles changed, got motivated to do something more interesting, more intellectual. Life without him in music would be the same as life without William Shakespeare.\" 8 Little Splashes\nThey Might Be Giants just ended a 100-performance tour of Europe and North America, and instead of playing Madison Square Garden and charging big money, it has taken over the Variety Theater, an ex-porno palace at 110 Third Avenue, between 13th and 14th Streets in the East Village. The group, which has been touring with a band instead of its usual boom-box accompaniment, is performing for eight nights starting at 6:30 tonight, and it has a different opening act each night. The openers include David Thomas, Boss Hog and Eugene Chadbourne.\n\"We didn't want to do a big place,\" said John Flansburgh, who, with John Linnell, makes up the group. \"Doing smaller shows, where people can sit down and check out the music more intensely, where a show is not so much like controlling a riot, would give us a chance instead to do real musical moments. We have a history of doing long stands in New York, and it lets us mix up the show more, so we can stretch things out a bit. And it's a good excuse to get to our homes -- we're on the extra crispy leg of a yearlong world tour, so it gives us a good excuse to get back to Brooklyn.\"\nThe group has produced the whole engagement, an unusual move that has given it the freedom to select the opening acts, shape the look of the show and determine everything else about it.\n\"It's better this way than if everything were picked by a promoter,\" Mr. Flansburgh said. \"We lose the money if the money is lost, but it's worth it. And the Variety Theater has got the best marquee below 30th street, and it's been completely renovated, so people shouldn't stick to the floor.\n\"It's a nice place to see a show and it's not just for people who want to slam dance in the mosh pit. It's also for people who don't know what a mosh pit is. I hate big stagey productions, so I don't want our fans to think we've gone U2 on them. In the continuum between N.R.B.Q.'s production and the Rolling Stones, we're way over on N.R.B.Q.'s side.\"\nThe group will perform with a saxophonist, a bassist and a drummer as a band, which Mr. Flansburgh said is \"a lot more challenging than a boom box.\"\n\"I've been doing this for 10 years, and with the band we're going through this really big transitional moment now which is good for us on a musical level. We're doing shows that are incredibly exciting, and people notice it. And the last show we do here will be a reprise of our first album. It'll be introduced by the talk show host Joe Franklin, which seems appropriate for New York.\""}, {"text": "THE SURROUNDING SCENE -- THE MELTING POT; The Tired, the Poor, the Laundry\n1992-07-14T05:00:00.000Z\nMohammed Hassan, a busboy at the Righa Royale Hotel, is busy this week filling the water glasses and clearing the dirty plates of the Democratic Senate Convention Committee members and their guests. But close as he is to the heart of the American political process, the 25-year-old immigrant from Bangladesh harbors no illusions about seeing democracy at work.\n\"They democracy, I work,\" said Mr. Hassan, who has lived in Astoria, Queens, since he won a visa in an immigration lottery a year ago.\nAs the city plays host to the Democratic National Convention this week, hotel workers, restaurant employees and taxi drivers, many of them foreign-born, brush closer to the big event than many other New Yorkers. And for the immigrant women who make the delegates' beds and the immigrant men who make their cappuccinos, the convention is at once mystifying and vaguely exciting.\nFor Marie Dominique, a 51-year-old Haitian immigrant assigned the dubious honor of cleaning Gov. Bill Clinton's suite at the Hotel Intercontinental, it is merely nerve-wracking. 'I Just Wash, Wash, Wash'\n\"I don't speak to him, but I speak to his wife,\" said Mrs. Dominique, who takes home $320 for 35 hours of scrubbing a week. \"I just wash, wash, wash and she say, 'Take your time, relax.' That's why the Democrats make me happy. Because they don't treat you down, like the Republicans. The Republicans, they're mean.\"\nMost foreign-born tourism workers are not quite as partisan as Mrs. Dominique, who, like so many of her compatriots, sees President Bush as an enemy of the deposed Haitian president, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.\nRather, as they vacuum the confetti of the political party that considers itself the voice of the immigrants, most immigrant workers do not know they are being spoken for. Some, for that matter, have no idea what the hoopla is all about. Curious About Gore\n\"I just know the name of this convention, the International Democratic Convention,\" said Ludmila Pushkosh, a math teacher from Odessa, Ukraine, who works as a maid at the Sheraton Park Avenue. \"It is, I think, a lot of people from different nationalities who talk about communication between peoples.\"\nIn contrast, Tilak Ranaweera, who owned a coconut farm in Sri Lanka and now cleans rooms at the Sheraton New York, was intensely curious about Governor Clinton's choice of Senator Al Gore as running mate. Mr. Ranaweera, who arrived in this country three months ago.\n\"Is it because of his position on the environment?\" he asked on Sunday. \"Here people waste a lot of things.\"\nTraditionally, Democratic leaders, particularly in the Northeast, have waxed eloquent about the immigrant pursuit of the American Dream. At the 1984 and 1988 conventions, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts spoke rapturously of their Italian and Greek forebears. Ellis Island is less central to the oratory of Governor Clinton of Arkansas, but not far at all from the minds of the many delegates who are trekking there for a visit this week.\n\"My father came to this country from Poland the day Warren Harding was elected president,\" said Elaine Bloom, a Florida legislator and delegate. \"I imagine that for the immigrants working at our hotel, this moment is as moving for them as that moment was for him.\" 'Still Sleeping at Noon'\nWell, not quite. \"I'm mad at the Democrats,\" said Marta Cruz, a housekeeper from the Dominican Republic, as she munched on chicken Sunday in the Sheraton New York's employee cafeteria. \"I have five rooms full of them -- and they're all still sleeping at noon.\"\nFor some recent immigrants, the difference between the Republicans and the Democrats appears so subtle as to be inconsequential. \"In Sri Lanka, we have two parties that are easier to distinguish, the extreme socialists and the extreme capitalists,\" said Mr. Ranaweera, 37 years old.\nFor others, however, the lines are more clearly drawn. \"Well, the Democrats stand for more like people and such,\" said Anne Marie Standly, a 32-year-old Trinidadian, as she paused in her vacuuming at the Sheraton New York, a convention headquarters. \"The Republicans are more like for money and monuments.\"\nSome of the immigrant hotel workers assumed that one was a Democrat if he or she was a believer in democracy. \"I'm born and raised a Democrat and that's the truth,\" said Eunita King, a St. Lucian who grew up in Barbados, a Commonwealth member with a Parliament. Dreams Are Far Away\nAlthough this confusion would seem fortuitous for the Democratic Party, many immigrants from the Caribbean -- like Mrs. King and Mrs. Dominique, the Clintons' hotel housekeeper -- don't seek citizenship, preferring to hold on to their dreams of returning home. Other immigrants become citizens but don't vote.\n\"The procedure how to register -- I never learned it,\" said Anna Frydman, a Polish housekeeper who has lived in the United States for 22 years.\nMrs. Frydman is, however, learning an aspect of the democratic process that will not be shown on C-Span. As she entered the room of a union official at the Sheraton New York on Sunday morning, she noted that the bed was still tightly tucked in, the nightly chocolate still on the pillow.\n\"Somebody didn't sleep at home last night,\" she said. \"Party, party, party.\"\nPervasive as the media are in all languages, most immigrants, in and out of the hotel industry, have at least some idea of who's who. Getting the General Idea\n\"George Bush? He have a lot of experience,\" said Fiona Yu, a cashier at the Hotel Maria who arrived in New York from Hong Kong last year. \"Bill Clinton? He make me feel -- not very honest, maybe too young. And he have a scandal: Little Flowers.\"\nPenny Shum, a 44-year-old immigrant from Shanghai who cleans rooms on the 46th floor of the Sheraton New York, engages every delegate she sees in conversation. And her story is a rich one, like the stories of so many of the workers silently tending to the Democrats this week.\n\"Do you know the great Cultural Revolution?\" she begins. \"Well, I was forced into the countryside to farm. Then I go back into the city to work at a factory. At night, I go to Chinese Medical College. I mostly learn acupuncture, massage. Many people call me Dr. Shum.\n\"I came here for the children's future,\" she continued, wiping the headboard on a queen-size bed. \"I want them to live more than me. Maybe someday they be guest here at the Sheraton. Like a Democrat.\""}, {"text": "For Flier People, Peskiness Is a Virtue\n1992-05-03T05:00:00.000Z\nWhen Mohamed Zayed, an Egyptian immigrant, wrote home recently to his wife about his progress in America, he held some things back. \"I wrote her only that I could not find a job in my specialty, and that I have taken a temporary position in the field of distribution,\" he said.\nMr. Zayed, who was a chemist in his country, was standing in the field, in front of the Marriott Marquis Hotel at the southwest corner of Broadway and 46th Street, distributing fliers for a topless club on Eighth Avenue.\n\"I am ashamed of this flier,\" Mr. Zayed said with a self-deprecating smile. \"This dancing is not a part of my tradition. I am a religious man.\" He is Muslim, and during the Ramadan celebration last month, he said, he arranged to move his half-hour break from 4 P.M. to 6 P.M. so he could fast every day until sunset.\nStanding with Mr. Zayed on his corner for an hour on a nice day, it is easy to feel alienated amid the constant flow of humanity. Hundreds of people pass by -- tourists wielding cameras, teen-agers on class trips tagging after chaperones, men and women in office garb rushing to appointments. The tourists look up at the buildings, the New Yorkers look straight ahead, and almost no one seems to notice the 52-year-old man with the thick glasses wordlessly holding out fliers.\n\"Rejection, refusal,\" Mr. Zayed commented. \"I have internal feeling that this is bad job.\" He said he felt painfully conspicuous in his apron with the name of the topless club in big letters, but in fact he seemed as anonymous as the nearby pay telephone.\nFlier people, as their employers refer to them, are anonymously everywhere on the streets of Manhattan these days. Most are immigrants working one of the crudest of trades in a not-very-job-friendly time. All of them are tenuous tenants of the very bottom of the way up.\nOn Fifth Avenue, peddlers -- yes, even peddlers are generally considered a higher form of street life -- sell fake Rolex watches, homeless people solicit change and three-card monte players con the naive. The flier people just stand there, asking for nothing and offering no product. Flier people are just a piece of paper stuck in your face.\nNo one knows how many flier people there are, but on a recent walk along a five-block stretch of midtown, the count was 25. They were giving out fliers for golf lessons, fast food, designer shoes, foot examinations and leather skirts. Better Than Stealing\nMost of the 25 were people from somewhere else who spoke just enough English to make it understood that this was the only job they could get. There was Faraba Konteh from Gambia, Krishna Dey from Bangladesh, Hernando Marin from Colombia, Fernando Gonzalez from Mexico and David from Russia. And one American, Albert Tindall, from the Bronx.\n\"This is better than robbing someone,\" said Mr. Tindall, who was at the southeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 40th Street, giving out fliers that advertised $3.99 men's bathing suits at Odd-Job Trading.\nFlier people earn about $4.25 an hour, without benefits, though those who dress up as, say, clowns or computers can make up to $9 an hour. Mr. Zayed, who had been laid off from his dishwashing job, said he found his flier position three months ago through a friend who had given it up and gone back to Egypt.\nDavid, the Russian, said he had walked up Fifth Avenue collecting fliers, and then visited the businesses listed on them to offer his services. He was hired by the Midtown Golf Club, at 7 West 45th Street.\nOne of the owners of the golf club, Bob Sacco, walked by as David was talking. Mr. Sacco said he was checking on the flier people. David, he said, was the exception: a reliable flier person.\n\"We have to get rid of about one a week,\" Mr. Sacco said. \"It's not easy to get guys who are really going to do it.\" Some, he said, throw the fliers in the nearest trash can.\nMr. Zayed said he would never do that. \"My boss observe me,\" he said.\nDavid is one flier person who is hard to miss. For one thing, he is very tall. And he has amazing technique. While many of his competitors seem to be apologizing for their existence, David thrusts his fliers at passers-by with an authoritative air. \"They told me, 'Be aggressive,' \" he said. It works: He says he gives out as many as 300 fliers in four hours.\nThis is what Harvey Stone, the manager of On Call, a temporary Manhattan employment agency, says he tells flier people: \"Approach the person as they're coming up to you, wish them a very good morning, extend your hand with a smile on your face, and say, 'Sale at . . ..' Some people will take, some won't take. You can't take it personally.\"\nThat can be hard, Mr. Tindall said. \"Some people take it and just crumple it up right in front of you.\".\nFliers, or handbills, are one of the oldest, and least sophisticated, forms of advertising. And they are cheap: it costs about $20 to print 1,000 fliers.\nNew Yorkers tend to stake out personal stances on various facets of street life -- giving money to the homeless, buying watches from unlicensed peddlers, trying to beat the cars across the intersection. Flier people also require a position.\nThis is DeAnna Stango's: Take no fliers. \"I hate to be bothered while I'm walking,\" Ms. Stango, who is an office receptionist, said, seconds after she had passed Mr. Zayed. \"I feel like I'm in Mexico.\" Nasty Intrusion\nTo Jennifer Borum, a freelance writer walking up Broadway in the 60's, flier people are one more intrusion into \"my space.\" \"If I see them, I try to avoid them. If I can't, I try to be nice and say, 'No thank you.' \"\nJohn Smith, who is in sales, makes a point of taking fliers, except for topless clubs and related activities. \"I feel sorry for the guys doing it,\" said Mr. Smith, who was in the crowd in Times Square the other day. \"They're out there trying to earn a buck.\"\nThere is one person, William H. Whyte, the urban sociologist, who has studied flier people. \"I think they're one of the glories of New York,\" said Mr. Whyte, who featured a flier person named Handbill Frank in a documentary. \"They're going out to meet the market. You don't find them in Dayton, Ohio.\"\nThe best flier person in the city these days may be \"the Love guy,\" as Johnny Wright is called. Mr. Wright, 57, a former bricklayer who lost his leg several years ago, sits on a metal chair in front of the Love store at 62d and Broadway. A Streetwise Charmer\n\"One for you, darling,\" he called out the other morning, demonstrating his quick two-handed flier delivery. Pedestrians smiled, greeted him by name -- and, in a sharp departure from policy, took his flier, with the coupons for shampoo and cold medicine. \"I only take fliers from Johnny,\" said Felicia Scandrick, an agent at the nearby AAA travel office.\nBesides his sidewalk hospitality, there are two other secrets to Mr. Wright's success -- \"the Love dogs,\" Star and Harley, yellow labradors that lounge on a cushion beside Mr. Wright's chair.\n\"You've got to produce\" Mr. Wright said. \"I go inside the store and ask, 'How are the fliers doing?' If they say, 'We're getting a lot of coupons,' I feel better. If they say, 'We're not getting so many,' I say, 'I've got to push harder tomorrow.' \""}, {"text": "The Hatreds of India; Hindu Memory Scarred by Centuries Of Sometimes Despotic Islamic Rule\n1992-12-11T05:00:00.000Z\nWhen Hindus destroyed a 16th-century mosque in a remote northern town on Sunday, they touched off four days of rioting in which hundreds were killed as Muslims protested against what they saw as persecution.\nHindu leaders said the militants were trying to sweep away deep feelings of inferiority and were asserting the dominance of Hinduism in Indian society, culture and politics.\nThe paradox is that Hindus are not a persecuted minority. They are, in fact, the vast majority of a country that regards itself as heir to an ancient civilization. Hindus account for 83 percent of the 882 million Indians.\nThe deep-rooted cause of India's crisis is that despite their history, Hindus as well as Muslims act out of a sense of persecution. Centuries of Brutality\nThe Hindus' sense of inadequacy and the passionate emotions it breeds are rooted in a history of brutal occupations by Islamic rulers over the past 1,000 years.\nBut these long memories have also been inflamed by a series of what Hindus see as injustices that began with the creation of the country in 1947, when Pakistan was severed from India and set up as an Islamic state. (East Pakistan became Bangladesh.)\nSince 1947, Hindus have seen Muslims rise up in the Kashmir Valley and again threaten the unity of India. Hindus have seen the Sikhs of the Punjab take up arms to press their claim for a separate state. Hindus have seen the Supreme Court allow Muslim men to divorce their wives without paying alimony, as Muslim tradition allows. (The court ruled that Sharia, or Muslim law, held precedence for Muslims over Indian civil law.)\nIn all of this, India's Hindus are resentful and angry, and many are determined to wrest what they see as their country back from the discriminatory bonds of secularism. Accusations of Appeasement\nFor many Hindus, India should become a Hindu state, a nation run by and for Hindus. This is why the mosque was destroyed.\n\"It has a whole history,\" Jipendra Kumar Tyagi, a physician at a government hospital here, said of the mosque's destruction. \"Here in this country, the majority people are so much harassed. The policies of the Government are to appease the Muslims for petty political gain.\"\nThe tension was reflected in the reaction to Mr. Tyagi's comments during a conversation with several Hindus. Many joined in approvingly but a young man, Hari Kumar, a sociology graduate student at Delhi University, dissented.\n\"This is the most disastrous incident for our country,\" he said. \"I feel our country has been pushed back 20 years. You are believing this propaganda. You are not being rational people.\" An Instinct for Prejudice\nAs the talk skittered back and forth, emotions ran high, and one man accused Mr. Kumar of being \"commissioned from the other side,\" an allusion to Pakistan, thus baring the instinctual prejudices, the tendrils of real and imagined history that collude in dividing many of the 732 million Hindus from the 97 million Muslims.\nMany Hindus, probably a vast majority, think of themselves as somehow second-class citizens in their own land, somehow shunted aside as the Muslims are granted special privileges. It is a sentiment that is sometimes viscerally held, a sentiment that has become the fuel for a new type of Indian politics, the politics of divisiveness, mistrust, religious chauvinism.\nIndia's Hindus, historically, have not enjoyed an always comfortable relationship with Islam. Ten centuries ago, Mahmud of Ghazni, an Afghan ruler, spent a good deal of time touring India with his armies, leaving a trail of looted towns and wrecked Hindu temples. This was India's first experience with the Muslim world.\nAfter a respite of 200 years another Afghan, Muhammad of Ghor, led his armies to what is now Delhi, where he defeated King Prithvi Raj III and captured the region. A Mogul's Disdain\nFor centuries after, Muslim invaders ruled large chunks of India, allying themselves with Hindus when convenient, obliterating Hindu influence when necessary. Babur, the first of the Mogul kings, who marched into India in the early 16th century, saw opportunities for booty but remained singularly unimpressed by his conquest.\n\"Hindustan,\" he wrote dismissively, \"is a country that has few pleasures to recommend it. The people are not handsome. They have no idea of the charms of friendly society, of frankly mixing together, of familiar intercourse.\n\"They have no genius, no comprehension of mind, no politeness of manner, no kindness or fellow-feeling, no ingenuity or mechanical invention in planning or executing their handicraft works, no skill or knowledge in design or architecture; they have no horses, no good flesh, no grapes or musk melons, no good fruits, no ice or cold water, no good food or bread in their bazaars, no baths or colleges, no candles, no torches, not a candlestick.\"\nMogul rule gave way to the British, and the British to the new nations of Pakistan and India in 1947. But nationhood, achieved over the bodies of half a million Muslims and Hindus slaughtered in the partition, did not bring with it a sense of renewal, a sense of confidence, a sense of marching into the modern world.\nTo the Hindu ear, Babur's words still stung like a fresh slap.\nIndia's history is not, for most Hindus, a record of earlier civilizations, of distant wars, religions, economies, societies, the stuff of dusty tomes. Instead history, or at least the version retold by Hindu ideologues, is evidence of an enduring Islamic hostility to Hinduism, of the repression of Hindus at the hands of an alien religion.\n\"So many temples have been destroyed by Babur,\" explained Dr. Tyagi. \"We have had this sentimental feeling for centuries. I think the Ram temple should be there.\" A Hindu's Grievances\nAs a matter of faith, Hindu fundamentalists believe fervently that the mosque built by Babur in Ayodhya was on the precise site where their god Ram was born 5,000 years ago, a mosque that was erected after a Hindu temple was leveled. The destruction of the mosque, which was praised by Dr. Tyagi and many members of India's solid middle class, was revenge for that insult 464 years ago.\nBut what fuels Hindu passions even more than the abuse of history is the perception, deeply and immovably held, that Muslims continue to enjoy special privileges endowed by the ruling Congress Party to preserve itself in power over most of the past 45 years.\nDr. Tyagi willingly provides a litany of grievances.\n\"Thousands of temples in Kashmir have been demolished,\" he said. \"Hindus have been forced out. There is Shah Bano,\" which allows Muslims to invoke Sharia rather than civil law in divorce cases. \"This was a decision to appease the Muslims. If there is any sports event and Pakistan wins over India, this particular community cheers. It has been going on for 40 years. This should be checked.\"\nMr. Kumar, the graduate student, regards people like Dr. Tyagi as easy prey for Hindu ideologues. \"The propaganda war by the Hindu fundamentalists,\" he said, \"has been in such a systematic manner that they are quite convincing. This propaganda war deals with Hindus killed in the Punjab, Hindus forced to leave Kashmir, hundreds of temples destroyed in Kashmir, privileges under the law.\"\nFor the Muslims, the events of the past week augur ill, for them and for India's secular credentials. Indeed, Tahir Mahmood, the head of Islamic and Comparative Studies at the Indian Institute of Islamic Studies, likens the events at Ayodhya to the actions of Germany's skinheads and to the behavior of the Nazis. Standards Have Changed\n\"It is exactly the kind of thing that is happening in Germany,\" Mr. Mahmood said. \"In practice, these Hindus have been the opposite of tolerance and nonviolence.\" He said that most Muslims were baffled by the anguish expressed by Hindus over Babur's mosque in Ayodhya.\n\"For the average Muslim in the street, it is quite logical,\" he explained. \"This was done 500 years ago and this was done according to thoughts then. The kings did it their own way. These things happening now in 1992 seem to be no excuse. It seems inexplicable to Muslims. There was no case for demolishing the mosque, even if Babur demolished a temple 500 years ago.\" A 'Bewildered' Community\nRasheeduddin Khan, the director of the Indian Institute of Federal Studies and a former member of the upper house of Parliament, says the persistent antipathy between the two communities is a direct consequence of sundering Pakistan from India in 1947.\n\"Partition has left a scar on everyone,\" he said. \"The partition of a country on religious grounds is irrational. It is not acceptable as part of modern statecraft.\"\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party, the political party of Hindu fundamentalists, \"has been systematically propagating that Muslims are not to be trusted,\" Mr. Khan continued.\n\" 'Look at these Muslims when they ruled India',\" he quoted Hindus as saying. \" 'They built mosques on our temples. The role of the Muslim has been to oppress you and destroy your dignity.' Nobody questions that. This has reached even the rational strata of people, doctors, engineers.\"\nThe Muslims, who are bearing the brunt of the sectarian violence that is sweeping over dozens of cities and towns, have become visibly cowed by the assertion of Hindu might demonstrated in Ayodhya, \"bewildered and benumbed,\" in Mr. Khan's words.\n\"When you have B.J.P.-like parties who openly speak of building a new Hindu ethos, as opposed to a new composite Indian ethos, you allow communal polarization, allow intolerance,\" Mr. Khan concluded.\nMr. Mahmood wonders whether there is any way to bridge the gap.\n\"There is a very fundamental difference between Hindus and Muslims,\" he said. \"If we go by religious beliefs, what is most abhorrent in Islam is idol worship. For our religion it is so abhorrent. For the other it is normal practice. For followers of Islam, they cannot compromise on that. That seems to be the main reason these communities cannot reconcile.\"\nFor Mr. Mahmood, however, India's salvation can only lie in the preservation of secularism, the Government's neutrality in matters of faith.\n\"India must try and retain its secularism,\" he said. \"Whether it will, we will see.\" And if it fails, \"we are going back into the medieval ages.\""}, {"text": "Can the West Afford Flood of Bosnia Refugees?\n1992-08-28T05:00:00.000Z\nTo the Editor:\nMargaret Thatcher (\"Stop the Excuses. Help Bosnia Now,\" Op-Ed, Aug. 6) rightly demands a Western military presence in Bosnia. \"False Humanitarianism,\" Leslie H. Gelb's column the same day, calls our substitution of food parcels \"a scam.\"\nSince the West, save only President Francois Mitterrand, has been dilatory and cowardly in the face of moral appeals, perhaps it will listen to a more cynical, economic, argument: easy military victories are cheaper than hundreds of thousands of refugees, who, if not rapidly returned to their homes, will never go back. Indira Gandhi showed the world this economic truth in Bangladesh in 1971, when her military intervention saved not only lives, but also money.\nAnother precedent to remember is the Greco-Turkish solution of 1920: partly redraw the frontiers, partly move the people, both ways. That is, separate them at the least cost of money and lives, with people exchange one of many tools. But there was no world supervision, so much blood was spilled.\nThe historic nation of Bosnian Muslims is only two million strong, 40 percent of the republic's population. Serbs can flee to Serbian territories, Croats to Croatian, but Bosnians can only flee abroad to molder in our camps or die where they are. So there must be border changes. These would have to be an act of force by the United Nations or NATO troops. Let no one say there is no precedent: the West has done it in Iraqi Kurdistan without even diplomatic recognition.\nWe must not now keep Tito's irresponsible republic borders; that would be like restarting the Hundred Years War. On the contrary we must establish a more militarily defensible free ethnic Bosnia, smaller than the present territory. There must be money for those displaced by our action in either direction. But we owe nothing to previous migrants, unless they are Bosnians returning from previous deportation.\nMigration has, for example, almost emptied Zagreb of Serbs without actual murder, and we have not the resources to move other populations about at will. So we must tolerate the brutal processes going on elsewhere, notably in the Krajina and Slavonia. After all, the Krajina is now militarily viable, which is the name of the new game. Our aim throughout must be peace in Bosnia with minimal movement of populations and only the necessary movement of other ethnic groups, especially Serbs.\nFinally, Bosnia is part of the Muslim world, with which the West's rela tions vary from hostile to delicate. We may be attacking a Muslim power shortly. Do we want to offend all these millions by refusing Bosnia help well overdue according to our own principles, which we say exclude Christian genocide? P.

In banks, you will not find a cluster of fellow Americans around you as you peer anxiously at the rates of exchange to see how far the dollar has fallen overnight. On the streets, you will not be passed by bus loads of earnest Japanese, their faces obscured behind cameras, snapping you in case you are of historical or topographical interest. The tourist trade has been shanghaied by nearby Bradford, which markets itself as a base for visiting Bronte country, Herriot country and all the other pieces of pop-geography that have replaced the historic Yorkshire Ridings. (Haworth has just erected direction signs in Japanese; Bradford sponsors weekends devoted to sampling its Indian restaurants.)\nBut as far as the tourist trade is concerned, Leeds raises its eyebrows and shrugs. Who needs it? Tourism is for towns in decline. Leeds, with a population of almost three-quarters of a million, has weathered the two great recessions of the 80's very nicely, thank you. New and converted office blocks proliferate, many of them designed in the hideous international style that some call \"Toytown Renaissance, \" but that Leeds city planners confidently designate as the \"Leeds Look.\" The foreigners in your hotel will not be tourists, they will be businessmen.\nTo walk up Briggate, for centuries Leeds's principal thoroughfare, is at first to get the impression that Leeds is identical with any other English provincial city. All the usual names are there: Habitat, Marks & Spencer, Virgin Records, together with a few establishments that look as if they came yesterday and will be gone tomorrow. To get a sense of Leeds Past, you must raise your eyes, because, above the ground floors, all these businesses are in buildings that display the riotous fancies of Victorian architects -- Gothic, Moorish, Palladian and just plain odd. Here are the memorials to designers for whom conformity and uniformity were not gods. Plunge down one or other of the passages off Briggate (and unless you are sharp you will miss them) and you will find yourself in a still more ancient Leeds -- the Leeds of the old inn yards.\nBy no means the oldest but the best preserved of these inns is now known as Whitelocks, in the Turk's Head Yard, reached down an alleyway just above Marks & Spencer. Rebuilt in the 1880's, it has been restored miraculously close to its original state, so that the drinker of today can still relish its Art Nouveau stained glass, wrought-iron tables with curly legs, marble-topped bar and above all its omnipresent mirrors, advertising drinks no longer consumed brewed by breweries long defunct. To drink in the long, ornate bar of Whitelocks is to enter the sort of atmosphere in which Jude the Obscure disputed with the Oxford undergraduates, or his wife drew pints in dresses a shade too low-cut for decency.\nThe late Victorians found other ways for the decent citizens of Leeds to escape from the dirt and racket of a large industrial city -- a city that Dickens, for one, particularly disliked, and called \"an odious place.\" In the last decades of the 19th century a series of arcades was constructed where the middle-class shopper could walk sheltered from the elements and removed from the hubbub of hoi polloi and the omnibuses of Briggate. Times have changed, and shoppers have been lured into the mass-market delights of shopping malls, but the arcades of Leeds, extending from both sides of Briggate, cling on, each with its own distinctive character: the Grand is the seediest, but it retains its automated clock, with crusading knights marking the hours; Thornton's, the oldest, is still the most elegant; the County Arcade has been recently and splendidly refurbished -- all the shops are new, except for the corset shop (when did you last see a corset shop?), and all are spick-and-span, though in the current economic climate there is a slightly desperate sense of them waiting for something to turn up, preferably the retail sales figures.\nAt the top of Briggate, where it intersects with the Headrow, the visitor senses that he is at the core of Leeds. For all its bustle and surfeit of traffic there is still a breadth, a feeling of confidence and expansiveness about the Headrow that speaks of Leeds's great days in the 19th century when the wool industry made it Yorkshire's center. At the Briggate end you have the 20's neo-classicism of Lewis's department store -- not great architecture but agreeable in its solidity. Along the length there are grand Victorian pubs, the last music hall in the city (where such variety stars as Harry Lauder and Vesta Tilley appreared), and a series of solid banks and building societies. (The Headrow is now also punctuated by the appalling Schofield's shopping mall, chosen architectural horror of the year 1989 by The Sunday Times, a structure that can elicit only one response: a prayer that it fall down). And at the farther end of the Headrow is the great Town Hall.\nFor many people the Town Hall \nis \nLeeds. Its massive confidence represents a time when the provincial cities knew their worth and knew what they stood for. Others might opt for the fussiness of neo-Gothic for their municipal buildings: Leeds went for classical certainties and a square structure, many-columned and satisfyingly regular, topped (as an afterthought) by an assertive clock tower. Opened in 1858 by Queen Victoria, it seemed from the start to represent the city and to dignify it. Local government, then, was an important matter that attracted substantial and imaginative men. The interior structure is dominated by Victoria Hall -- gorgeously ornate, both classical and colorful, the towering organ surrounded be a central arch that proclaims: \"Except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it.\" The Victorian burghers had no doubt that the Lord had played His part in the building of this piece of civic magnificence, standing behind them like some sort of spiritual bank guarantor. Unfortunately, they diluted the starkness of the proclamation by a series of homely mottoes round the walls, including the decidedly unbiblical \"Honesty is the best policy\" and the gnomic \"Trial by Jury\" (not a reference to the Gilbert and Sullivan piece, still 17 years in the future). Today Victoria Hall functions as a concert hall, and the rest of the building houses a few overflow courtrooms. The various branches of local government have moved elsewhere, and many people are now proposing a proper, custom-built concert hall to replace it. As more and more of the functions of local government have been usurped by the central Government, the Town Hall, as if in protest, has become a white elephant, and is in danger of becoming a shell.\nIf the Town Hall and the buildings around it -- library, museum, art gallery -- make up the civic heart of Leeds, its people's heart is Kirkgate Market, on the other side and at the other end of Briggate. Large covered markets are almost unknown in the south of England, but they are a glory of the north, and the Leeds market is among the very finest. The present building dates from 1904, but it is on the site of an earlier one where Michael Marks, a refugee from Lithuania, began his rise to fortune as one half of Marks & Spencer by selling a variety of goods from his stall, all priced at one penny. Today the market is open every weekday, with a constant throng of shoppers and traders, the latter setting the tone of the place by bawling offers, undercutting their neighbors' prices and trading insults. It should perhaps be noted that \"love\" as a form of address carries in Yorkshire not an ounce of sexism or indeed of romance. The stall holder who asks his female customer, \"What do you fancy today, love?\" may address a male customer in identical terms, and it would be an exceedingly unwise one who thought there was any kind of sexual invitation involved. From the hundreds of stalls in the market can be bought fruits and vegetables, meat, game, clothing, flowers, confectionery and an array of foreign foods imported for the rich mix of peoples -- Poles, West Indians, Bangladeshi -- in the town. The wary shopper insists on getting the goods that are on show on the stall, not in the prepacked bags underneath it.\nLeeds, unlike such northern industrial cities as Manchester, has a compact center. Ten minutes' walk in any direction covers the extent of it. The corollary of this is that there is virtually no open space in the heart of Leeds. But the larger city more than makes up for this: in the suburbs there is a long string of parks -- bequeathed, very often, by manufacturers and businessmen, maintained by city fathers. Each has its own special character: Golden Acre has bird life, Beckett's Park has dignified William and Mary style college buildings, now part of Leeds Polytechnic; Lotherton Park has a rambling Edwardian country house where one can almost see the guests assembling for a weekend party. And Roundhay Park has everything. Roundhay really is the park of parks. It has been the \"lung\" of Leeds for over a century: an enormous open space with lakes, woodlands, bandstands, a fake-Gothic castle keep, an open-air arena and even a small fairground. Every form of sport and popular activity has been pursued within its boundaries, and it has even survived mass open-air pop concerts in the 80's. Initially decried as a piece of wanton extravagance on the part of the city council of Leeds, Roundhay came into its own with the advent of mass transport. To earlier generations especially it meant escape from the polluted industrial atmosphere of Leeds: fresh air, relief from toil and constraints -- freedom.\nAlmost as enticing a \"lung\" are the grounds of Temple Newsam, only five miles east of the city center. Here there are rolling lawns and fields, a rose garden and walks lined with massed rhododendrons, those rather unsatisfactory shrubs that look glorious for a week in June and sit dumpily on a great deal of space for the rest of the year. But the real attraction of Temple Newsam is the house. It is a Tudor mansion extensively remodeled in Charles I's reign in a slightly dated style that gives it an air of completeness and unity, especially in its courtyard, where, raised in stone around the roof of the house, the owner proclaimed his love of God, his allegiance to the King and his (spectacularly unfulfilled) hope for \"loving affection among his [the King's] subjects.\" \nIt was in this house that Lord Darnley, Mary, Queen of Scots's husband, came into the world in 1545, 21 years before being blown out of it at Kirk o'Field. Here in 1806 the future Prince Regent (George IV) met Lady Hertford, the mistress of his mature years -- \"forbidding, haughty, unpleasant looking\" is how she was described by a contemporary, but then the Prince was a notoriously bad picker. She became an owner of Temple Newsom in 1807, and he presented her (an odd love gift, surely?) with some superb hand-painted Chinese wallpaper, which adorns the Chinese drawing room to this day. In 1922 the great house was sold for a nominal sum to the city of Leeds by the future Lord Halifax, arch appeaser of Hitler and wartime ambassador to the United States. Since then the city has retrieved some of the original furniture and housed here most of the older paintings in its own collections, as well as exhibitions of ceramics and silverware. Temple Newsam is thus a museum, but a splendid one, and it retains its air of tranquil confidence, its sense of being undoubtedly the finest jewel in a crown, even if that crown is a municipal one.\nThe most evocative and mysterious open space in Leeds is also one of the smallest parks. Three miles to the west of the city itself lie the remains of Kirkstall Abbey. If it makes sense to talk of fine monastic ruins, these are among the very finest. Founded in the 12th century, this Cistercian abbey had an uneventful history in medieval times -- or perhaps its events were inward, spiritual ones. It may also have been the monks who began the local woolen trade. But with the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539 there began a history of casual pillage, neglect and spectacular collapse; in 1759 the Perpendicular tower sank into the nave of the Abbey church. Today some parts of the great structure are merely the remains of walls, others are pretty much as the monks left them, and the church rises, gaunt and roofless, a magnificent witness. \nAnd not least of the mysteries of the place is that hardly a soul visits it. Mothers and babies and courting couples sit around in the grounds, which slope down to the River Aire and are particularly fine in their spring dresses of daffodils, crocuses and cherry blossoms. But there is usually no one in the Abbey ruins, which is a boon for the visitor with imagination. Primed with material about the Abbey's history and its appearance in its heyday from the Abbey House Museum (the former gatehouse), one can wander in and around the remains, conscious of being in touch with the spiritual dimension of a great industrial city, in one of its earliest manifestations. For some young northern Jude the Obscure Kirkstall Abbey must have seemed like \"the heavenly Jerusalem.\"\nBut ending, as we began, with Jude, reminds us of a strange lacuna in the history of Leeds: it has never produced anyone of the slightest importance in literature or the creative arts. (Well, there was Barry Cornwall: hands up everyone who has heard of Barry Cornwall.) Nearby, and rival, Bradford has produced J. B. Priestley, Frederick Delius, David Hockney. Leeds people mutter that Patrick Bronte proposed to his wife at Kirkstall Abbey (there's no evidence that he did) and that Charlotte Bronte bought her trousseau here (she didn't), but in fact the Brontes have much stronger links with four or five other towns in the region. The odd fact is that the city has an artistic life as vigorous as that of any provincial English town: the Opera North in the beautiful Grand Theater; the West Yorkshire Playhouse, a new theater attracting capacity audiences; the City Art Gallery with its Henry Moore collection. And yet nobody to hail as a native son. There \nis \nAlan Bennett, the playwright, born in the suburb of Wortley. But are his funny, allusive plays the stuff of classics? Will he be someone future generations can \nboast \nabout? \nIf not, they will have to make do with T. S. Eliot's widow.WHEN IN LEEDSCHECKING IN\n All prices are based on $1.80 to $:1 and are for one night in the spring-summer season.\nAmong the international chain hotels in Leeds are the HILTON and the HOLIDAY INN.

All are open year round, and charge about $2 for admission.\nARMLEY MILLS is about three miles west of Leeds on Canal Road, off the A65 Kirkstall Road, in the town of Armley (telephone: 532-637-861). It was the world's largest woolen mill in the late 18th century, and today it is a museum devoted to the industries of Leeds. The wool display traces the progress of wool from the sheep's back to the clothing store and includes a carding engine, spinning mules, warping frames and weaving looms. Another exhibit illustrates the history of movie projection -- what is perhaps the very first motion picture ever filmed was shot from Leeds Bridge in 1888. There are also demonstrations of static engines and steam locomotives, both made in Leeds in the 19th century, an exhibition of underground haulage and a display on the electrification of Leeds. Open Tuesday through Sunday and bank holiday Mondays, 10 to 6.\nABBEY HOUSE MUSEUM is nearby, on the A65 Kirkstall Road, across from Kirkstall Abbey (532-755-821). Once the gatehouse of Kirkstall Abbey, it is now a museum depicting Leeds life in the 18th and 19th centuries. Three streets have been re-created on the ground floor, lined with shops including a pharmacy, an ironmongery, a grocery, a barber shop and an inn (the landlord's parlor is upstairs, filled with Victorian furniture and knickknacks). Exhibits show how the working people of Leeds cooked, laundered and lighted and heated their homes; there are also collections of toys and clothes. Open weekdays from 10 to 6, Sundays from 2 to 6.\nTEMPLE NEWSAM HOUSE is about three miles from Leeds, off the A63 Selby Road (532-647-321). The mansion is built in the Tudor style (it was altered considerably at later dates) and is known for its Georgian long gallery and Chinese drawing room. The house is set on 1,200 acres, with a large park designed by Capability Brown, extensive gardens and a home farm. There is a tea shop on the grounds. Open Tuesday to Sunday and bank holiday Mondays, from 10:30 to 6:15. \nTHWAITE MILLS is on an island between the Aire River and the Aire-Calder Canal, two miles south of Leeds, off the A61 and accessible from the M1 (532-496-453). During the 19th and early 20th centuries, this mill crushed stone that was used in paint and putty throughout the British Empire. Today it has two working waterwheels, and visitors can watch them power several pieces of 19th-century machinery. The owner's Georgian house has been restored and contains displays about the mill's history. Open Tuesday to Sunday and bank holiday Mondays, from 10 to 5."}, {"text": "The Himalayas' Hidden Kingdom\n1992-09-20T05:00:00.000Z\nWE stopped for our picnic of boiled eggs, roast potatoes and cheese on the rim of the Phobjika Valley, not far from where the road vanishes into the shadow of the Gantey monastery. The essence of Bhutan, the last Himalayan Buddhist kingdom, was all around.\nBehind us, obscured by a thicket of brilliant April rhododendrons -- red, lavender and yellow plants the size of trees -- was the retreat where Gantey's Buddhist abbot had retired for a long meditation. In front of us, on the valley floor where black-necked Siberian cranes had wintered, were half-timbered farmhouses, clusters of bamboo poles with flapping prayer flags and the emerald fields of spring.\nOnce a string of Buddhist civilizations stretched secure in their mountain valleys or on plateaus from the Hindu Kush to Tibet. In what is now Pakistan, they lie in ruins. The culture of Tibet is being irreversibly diluted under Han Chinese rule. In Nepal, where Guatama Buddha was born, Buddhism can be held suspect in a Hindu kingdom, except in the higher mountain communities far from the Katmandu Valley. Ladakh and Sikkim were absorbed by India, where Buddhism has all but disappeared as a major religion in the country where it first took root.\nIn the hidden kingdom of Bhutan, with fewer than a million people, it is not just Buddhism that has survived, but Tantric Tibetan Buddhism, with its temples of florid, erotic and sometimes terrifying statuary, its lamas in maroon robes chanting to ancient instruments. Traditional costumes, by law, must be worn by all Bhutanese citizens: the knee-length robelike kho for men and ankle-length kira for women. Houses and public buildings are still built in traditional style and trimmed in folk-art designs.\nAs we sat by the roadside near Gantey, I thought of old photographs I had recently studied in an account of 19th-century Bhutanese life. Viewed from where I sat, as from most other places in Bhutan, nothing had changed. No buses, no trucks, no cars. Just blossoming magnolia trees among the rhododendrons. And silence.\nThere is only one narrow highway that snakes across the inner Himalayas from west to east (or east to west, except that you can't start at that end). Barely two lanes wide, it connects most of the country's major historic fortress towns, from the capital, Thimphu, in the west, through Wangdiphrodang, Tongsa and Bumthang to Tashigang in the remote east. Punakha, the ancient capital and home for half the year of Bhutan's highest-ranking lama, the Je Khenpo, is a sidetrip away. So is Gantey.\nEach fortress town caters to the traveler's every need, spiritual and temporal in this agrarian mountain country, which has no cities as we know them. Thimphu has the air of a frontier outpost. The approaches to the dzongs are almost always spectacular, with the seemingly impenetrable fortress-monasteries rising above wooded slopes or river valleys to stand watch over daily life below.\nIn interior Bhutan, the kingdom the Bhutanese call Druk Yul, the Land of the Thunder Dragon, foreigners are few, as a matter of national policy. This small kingdom, untouched by the mass tourism that has marred other Himalayan countries, remains one of the world's most exclusive -- and expensive -- destinations. In 1991 barely 2,000 foreigners (not counting Indians from next door) visited the realm. Some Bhutanese think that's too many, and worry about the future now that the Government of King Jigme Singye Wangchuck has lifted the limit to 4,000 to encourage private investment in small hotels and trekking companies.\nThe decision had one immediately positive effect, however. A number of prominent Bhutanese families have ventured cautiously into tourism, opening exquisite Bhutanese-style inns in Thimphu and on the edges of the capital region. Tourists should request this kind of accommodation in advance; it allows visitors to avoid the drafty if colorfully decorated former government hotels or guest houses and the seedy Indian-run hostelries built for commercial tradesmen.\nNot just anybody can go to Bhutan, where all tours must be booked from abroad. Not just anybody would want to. The $220 a day fixed fee set by the Government for room, board and internal transportation, payable in advance, is a deterrent, as it is meant to be. And the inner temples of Bhutan's spectacular hilltop monasteries are closed to tourists, who are accompanied everywhere they go by gracious if omnipresent guides.\nThe national airline, Druk Air, has only one plane -- a small, sleek, 80-passenger British Aerospace 146 jet -- and no other flights are permitted to land at the sole Bhutanese airport at Paro, in western Bhutan, about a two-hour drive from Thimphu. The approach to Paro follows a river valley flanked by peaks.\nFor the visitor, the positive side of Bhutan's national tourism policy is the custom tour each foreigner can plan. Tourists can come for history and culture, for trekking or for nature tours in the most protected -- by royal decree -- environment in the Himalayas. On the trails, tent accommodations are cheaper than hotels -- about $130 a day, all inclusive.\nMy husband and I first went to Bhutan as a \"trekking party\" of two in the days when journalists were not welcome on reporting trips. Friends have put together ad-hoc parties of four or six. On my last visit I went alone to research a book, and therefore was assigned a full-time foreign service officer as a guide and interpreter. In all cases a reasonably new car or van is made available for travel inside the country, along with driver and guide. Many foreigners agree that Bhutanese drivers are the safest and most skilled in Asia.\nThirty years ago there were no roads there, no currency, no postal service and no tourists. Bhutan was effectively closed to the outside world. When tourism began, haltingly, little more than a decade ago, the Bhutanese first hoped to offer outsiders a rare glimpse of their endangered Tibetan Buddhist culture. But they soon drew back, stung by disruptive behavior and thefts from temples and monasteries.\nThe Bhutanese do allow foreigners access to temple festivals called tsetchu, sacred dances and dramas held in courtyards of the fortress-monastery dzongs. Such festivals take place only once a year but on a different date in each monastery town, usually in the spring or fall, and tourism reaches it peak in those months. So does Bhutanese anxiety. At the Paro tsetchu in March tourists barged into ceremonies with video recorders and ate and drank noisily during what were essentially religious rites, according to ruffled Bhutanese and some of the few foreign residents of Bhutan.\nWhen there are no festivals in progress, some dzongs, the seats of local government as well as religious authority and scholarship, welcome outsiders in small groups year round into public areas inside their high walls. There the unique architecture of a dzong, with its blend of administrative, martial and sacred functions, is on lavish display.\nIn Thimphu, the 17th-century (but extensively restored) Tashichhodzong, the fortress that houses the royal and national capital offices as well as the Je Khenpo's residence for the months he is not in Punakha, is a spacious construction in a river valley. But the pattern is familiar: nearly vertical wooden staircases lead up from the inner court to temples, monks' quarters and the throne room of the King.\nON the other side of the capital, the older Simtokha Dzong, now a school for monastic and linguistic studies, is more characteristically perched on an overlook for security, a reminder that Bhutan was a set of warring principalities until early in this century.\nBecause Simtokha Dzong is a school, foreigners can enter and look at its religious paintings and statuary, while also glimpsing children at their lessons.\nFor more lessons in Tantric Buddhist art, foreigners can enter the Memorial Chorten in Thimphu, a richly decorated monument dedicated to the memory of the King's late father, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck. Here can be seen the panoply of temple ornamentation, including the copulating figures that Tantric Buddhists see as the union of knowledge and wisdom.\nA visit to the national art school in Thimphu is fun. Children from rural villages are taught classical Buddhist arts and the national Dzongkha language, along with English. In a calculated gamble, King Jigme Wangchuck and his late father declared English the language of instruction, so that the young could move with skill and confidence into higher education abroad.\nVisitors to Paro, where everyone arriving and leaving by plane has the choice of spending at least one night, should take time to go to the small but very informative national museum built into the large watchtower high above the main dzong, but reachable by road. Even higher, and accessible only by a rigorous climb or on horseback, is Taksang Monastery, with a view of most of the Paro Valley.\nPunakha, an imposing fortress near the confluence of two Himalayan rivers, can be seen in a day trip from Thimphu. Of special interest is reconstruction there to replace a portion of the dzong destroyed several years ago by fire. All the work is being done in traditional style by artisans with classic craftsmanship and tools. Many Bhutanese contribute their craft work as an act of religious merit.\nFarther afield from Thimphu and Paro, but still within a journey of a day or two from the capital, are the dzongs at Tongsa and Bumthang.\nTongsa's monastery-fortress is arguably the most arrestingly placed of all, soaring above fingered valleys where the east-west highway meets one of the few roads south toward India, yet tucked into a small hilly town.\nOn shops and houses in Tongsa, stories from Buddhist mythology are painted by local artists. (In more rural villages along the way, the decor is often more basic, with elaborately detailed phalluses fashioned on plaster near doorways to plead for fertility.)\nIn Tongsa, traditional weavers can be seen working on yatras, narrow lengths of woolen cloth in distinctive Bhutanese colors of rust, red, blue and gold. The yatras are stitched together by Bhutanese seamstresses to make blankets, upholstery or jackets. They are also on sale, for less than $8 for a length of about 6 feet, in Bumthang, and in the hamlet of Gyetsa, on the road between Bumthang and Tongsa.\nBhutanese recommend buying these and other crafts in villages and towns away from Thimphu because patterns are more authentic and prices lower. In the national craft emporium in the capital, a full-length winter coat made of several yatra lengths will cost $175 or more.\nIf there is time to visit Bumthang, the rewards are many. Bumthang, a two-day trip by car from Thimphu through virgin forests and dramatic mountain passes, is considered the spiritual center of Bhutan.\nThe name Bumthang covers an area that includes the Jakar Dzong, a less dominating presence than fortresses overlooking other valleys, and a collection of temples associated with two of Bhutan's most revered Buddhist saints.\nGuru Rinpoche -- known in the wider Buddhist world as Padmasambhava, a monk who legend says flew miraculously to Taksang, near Paro, in the eighth century from the Swat Valley in what is now Pakistan -- brought Buddhism to Bhutan. Pema Lingpa, believed to be a reincarnation of the Guru Rinpoche, was born in Bumthang in the 15th century. He founded monasteries, wrote philosophical treatises and introduced sacred dances.\nA few miles out of town along the road from Jakar to Mongar, there is an unusual complex of temples at Kurjey Lhakhang, where Guru Rinpoche meditated and left the imprint of his body on a rock, according to Bhutanese belief.\nA 17th-century temple was built on the spot, to which have been added two newer temples.\nBUT Bumthang has more prosaic sites to offer those who want to better understand the soul of Bhutan. From the comfortable Wandichoeling Guest House, a small lodge where most foreigners stay -- unless it is overcrowded in the autumn tsetchu season -- it is a short walk to an extraordinary hospital built in two equally clean and reasonably well-equipped wings, one for modern medicine and the other for traditional healers. Patients are encouraged to cross from side to side for their chosen treatment.\nBhutanese say that the hospital, built with aid from Switzerland, Bhutan's most active foreign partner in development, is symbolic of the mesh of cultures the nation hopes to achieve.\nNext door to the guest house is another local institution with a tale to tell about the pragmatism of a people caught between a world of reincarnation and mundane concerns for the future of their children: a handsome primary school where young Bhutanese start the day with Buddhist prayers and then move into classrooms to learn about the environment, about sanitation and health, basic science and simple arithmetic.\nNo central government decree ordered the school into existence, the local administrator said. The parents of Bumthang built it themselves in less than a month, when they decided that the time was right to start educating their children in the ways of a wider world. A GUIDE TO ARRANGING A TRIP AND TO HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS Getting There\nAll tours to Bhutan must be booked abroad, but visitors can decide on their route into the country. Bhutan's only airport, at Paro, connects by Druk Air flights to Katmandu, Nepal; Bangkok, Thailand; Dhaka, Bangladesh, Calcutta and New Delhi. Tourist visas are required ($20) and are most easily obtained through a travel agent. Tour Companies\nAbout a dozen American tour companies offer advice and a reliable reservation service for trips to Bhutan, according to the Bhutan Tourism Corporation in Thimphu. Among them are:\nBhutan Travel, 120 East 56th Street, Suite 1430, New York, N.Y. 10022; telephone (212) 838-6382 or (800) 950-9908.\nAbove the Clouds Trekking, Worcester, Mass. 01602; (508) 799-4499 or (800) 233-4499.\nInsight Travel, 502 Livermore Street, Yellow Springs, Ohio 45387; (513) 767-1102. Insight, which caters to practioners of Buddhism as well as other spiritual traditions, describes its tours more as pilgrimages than vacations.\nInner Asia Expeditions, 2627 Lombard Street, San Francisco, Calif. 94123; (415) 922-0448 or (800) 777-8183.\nTourcan Vacations, 3200 Dufferin Street, North York, Toronto M6A 2T3. (416) 787-0334. Where to Stay\nAlthough visitors must buy a package tour, tourism officials and private hotel owners in Bhutan say tourists can request a particular hotel instead of being assigned one. The price will be the same. All rooms are clean and have private baths and Western-style beds.\nIn Thimphu, the capital, many tourists are assigned to the Mothithang Hotel, on a hill above the city. The setting is superb, but the hotel is big, a bit desolate and too far for a stroll into town. The alternatives:\nHotel Druk is a workaday Indian-owned business hotel within walking distance of shops and the Memorial Chorten.\nJumolhari Hotel, close to the Druk on Thimphu's main street, Norzin Lam, is smaller and more Bhutanese in character.\nYu Druk, a thoroughly Bhutanese inn on a hillside away from the town center (but not as far away as the Mothithang), is owned by the well-known family of Sonam Wangmo Tenzing, whose local travel agency also organizes trekking tours and welcomes direct communications from tourists. Mrs. Tenzing can be reached by fax at (00975) 22116.\nDechen Hotel, another family-run inn in a residential section, is slightly closer to town. The family -- Dechen Zam and her husband, Dasho Dukpon -- also owns Dechen Cottages, in Mendegong, a hilltop retreat between Thimphu and Punakha with a wonderful view over farming villages. A traditional stone bath, with water steamed over hot rocks, is about $6 extra and takes three hours to prepare.\nIn Paro, the lodges and cottages of the Olathang Hotel, in a woodland setting, are undergoing a face-lift.\nIn Tongsa, Bumthang and Tashigang, visitors do not yet have a choice of hotels. In Phunsholing, Bhutan's commercial center on the Indian border, the Hotel Druk is best, though not outstanding. What to Eat\nBhutan's hotels usually offer a small variety of Indian, Western and a few Bhutanese dishes. Among the local items are momo, the small Tibetan dumplings filled with cheese, vegetable or meat. More Bhutanese are the fern fronds cooked like asparagus; pakshee paa, a sliced pork dish with chilis and radishes; ema datsee, a chili and cheese dish, or hewa datsee, a combination of potatoes, cheese and chilis. Most Bhutanese dishes are very hot -- green chilis are eaten there as vegetables: beware of dishes that look like string beans. In Bumthang, specialties are buckwheat pancakes or noodles.\nPotatoes, asparagus in season, mushrooms, carrots and spring onions are abundant, as are oranges, apples and mangoes, among other fruits. Try Bhutanese red rice, a delicious side dish. Currency\nThe Bhutanese unit of currency, the ngultrum, is pegged to the Indian rupee, now about 25 to the dollar. Indian currency is accepted in Bhutan, as are some credit cards in larger hotels, but Bhutanese money is often preferred. Traveler's checks must usually be cashed at a bank in Thimphu before trips to the interior. There is now an American Express agent in the capital, Chenddu Travels, on Norzim Lam, where traveler's checks can be bought with the American Express card. What to Read\nThere is only one thorough and reliable guide, written recently by the French scholar Francoise Pommaret. Her book, \"An Illustrated Guide to Bhutan,\" includes both an introduction to Bhutanese culture and arts and down-to-earth information. The guide, published by Editions Olizane in Geneva, is sold in crafts shops and bookstores in Thimphu in French or English for about $10. What to Buy\nBhutanese handicrafts are generally expensive because they are not made in quantity. Larger hotels have small craft shops, but there are four good stores in Thimphu where the selection is relatively large. These are the Handicrafts Emporium, a Government-built showroom near the Bank of Bhutan; Peljorkhang, up a flight of stairs off Norzin Lam near the main crossroads; The Larder, a small shop near the Bistro restaurant off the town square, and Etho Meto, near the Thimphu movie house, which also sells maps.\nBhutan's crafts, some unique to the country, include dance masks, handmade paper, woven fabrics -- on a recent visit a kho length of about eight feet cost $150 in raw silk and a kira $300, with a set of cotton placemats under $10. There is also inexpensive silver jewelry or more valuable items of silver and gold, turned wooden bowls of various sizes (a rice bowl with lid is about $20) and coats made of yatra cloth for $100 to $200.\nThe widest range of crafts (plus postcards and books) are on display at the Handicrafts Emporium. Etho Meto often has the best selection of Bhutanese stamps, including first-day covers prized by collectors. Peljorkhang has a good selection of woodcraft, masks and small shrines. The Larder sells handwoven purses, cosmetic cases and attractive slippers for under $10."}, {"text": "Silence of the Frogs\n1992-12-13T05:00:00.000Z\nIn the early 70's, a bizarre, inexplicable illness was sabotaging the academic career of Cynthia Carey. Then a young biologist, she was writing a dissertation on the physiology of coldblooded animals. Her creature of choice was Bufo boreas, named for the ancient Greek god of the north wind, an extravagant tag for a warty, blotchy, four-inch toad. It is more commonly and appropriately known as the western toad, its range encompassing the mountains of western North America. Twice a week, Carey went into the vast, pristine wilderness of Colorado to do her research. At times the toads were so plentiful she had to be careful when driving away not to crush them under her wheels.\nIn 1973, two years into her work, the illness struck. When she went into the field, Carey started coming upon an alarming sight: dozens of dying toads, toads barely able to move because their legs were puffy and red. She took one back to a veterinarian, who told her the toads were dying from an opportunistic infection because their immune systems had collapsed. But why?\nCarey was in no position to unravel the mystery -- she had a dissertation to do. But by 1979, there were no western toads, healthy or sick, to be found at any of the previous sites, or anywhere else in Colorado she looked. \"These are wilderness areas,\" she says today from her laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where she is an associate professor of biology. \"There was no development, no housing, no habitat destruction. I was sad and mystified.\"\nShe was also in trouble. \"I had to change my research. You can't tell your tenure committee, 'I haven't done my research because all my animals went extinct.' \" Instead she switched to bird eggs, became an expert on them and for the next nine years thought little about where all the toads had gone.\nThen in 1988, she read a scientific paper on how environmental disturbances suppress the immune systems of fish. \"That's when all the lights went on,\" Carey says. She has since set out to discover what happened to Bufo boreas, now missing from at least 80 percent of its historic range.\nAround that time the same light bulb was clicking on for herpetologists (scientists who study amphibians and reptiles) all over the world. And by 1989, the light was blinding. That year in Canterbury, England, the first World Congress of Herpetology was taking place. On the agenda were esoteric and, to the non-herpetologist, faintly ridiculous-sounding presentations like \"Belly Pattern of Triturus Carnifex and Triturus Vulgaris in Two Ponds of Ligurian Apennines, Northern Italy.\" But to many of the 1,300 participants from around the world, it was as if there were another conference taking place in the hallways and over meals, during breaks and at talks late into the night. The subject of this impromptu conference could be summed up in one ominous question: Where have all the frogs gone?\n\"A bunch of us got together and started comparing notes,\" recalls Jay M. Savage, a professor of biology at the University of Miami. \"People were struck by the fact it seemed to be occurring on a worldwide basis.\"\nSavage has spent much of the last 40 years studying the evolution and ecology of amphibians, mostly in Central America. In 1964, he and a colleague discovered a species of toad native to Costa Rica, in what is now called the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve. The toad's Latin name is Bufo periglenes, but it is better known as the golden toad -- the male a Day-Glo orange. The golden toad lives underground, and emerges for an annual, explosive, breeding season. Since 1964, scientists have watched as thousands of these tiny, vivid animals gathered for their yearly ritual. That was until 1988. That year, at the primary breeding site, only one adult male was found. Two years later, there were none -- and none have been seen since.\nThe apparent disaster is being repeated among other Cloud Forest species. The exquisite glass frogs, small lime-green animals with see-through undersides and large quizzical eyes, were abundant until the late 80's; now they can hardly be found. \"Jewels in the night we called them,\" Savage recalls. \"You used to see hundreds.\"\nThe black, yellow and red patterned harlequin frog, an amorous creature that can spend days clamped in a breeding embrace, also virtually disappeared in the late 80's. \"Human beings are great at rationalization,\" Savage says. \"We said, it must be local damage; if we just went over the hill, we'd find them. Most herpetologists were trying to explain things that way. What was striking was we found it was happening on such a broad basis.\"\nAt the meeting, Michael J. Tyler, an associate professor of zoology at University of Adelaide in Australia who has an enviable record for identifying remarkable species, told of the disappearance of the gastric brooding frog named Rheobatrachus silus. In 1974, Tyler identified the reproductive strategy of this inhabitant of the rain forest in the Connondale Ranges in Australia. The strategy was so implausible that when Tyler wrote a paper describing it, the editors of Nature rejected it. (Science magazine, however, did publish the findings.) The Rheobatrachus female swallows her fertilized eggs, which then gestate in her stomach and are regurgitated as tiny froglets six weeks later. It was hoped the frog, who somehow turns off her gastric activity, could provide a breakthrough in treating human stomach ailments.\n\"We were looking at the frontiers of biological science,\" says Tyler. \"We were rewriting concepts of how bloody magnificent some animals are.\" In 1980, the gastric-brooding frog disappeared, as usual, in the rocks for the winter. But then not one emerged that spring, nor has one been seen since. The species is now presumed extinct. To add to the puzzle, a number of the area's other frog species vanished as well, and remain missing.\nIn the United States, Bufo boreas is not the only amphibian disappearing from the West. Also in decline are the Yosemite toad, the mountain yellow-legged frog and the red-legged frog, which was likely the protagonist in Mark Twain's famous story \"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County.\" These frogs are missing from sites where they have been abundant in naturalists' accounts going back 75 years.\nIn all, almost one-third of North America's 86 species of frogs and toads appear to be in trouble. (In general, frogs have a smoother, more moist skin and live more closely to water than toads, which are squatter and often covered with warty bumps.) Gary Fellers, a research biologist with the National Park Service, visited Lassen Volcanic National Park in Northern California last year looking for the once-common Cascades frog. He used as his guide historic research papers describing the frog as being present every few feet. \"We visited 50 sites with decent habitats,\" he says. \"We found two frogs at one site.\" This year there were none.\nUntil recently, one of the most common sounds in western Canada's national parks was the low, throaty grunt of the northern leopard frog, Rana pipiens, the green-spotted creature almost everyone dissected in high school. Then, in the 1980's, the frogs started dying and populations plunged. The government of Alberta has even put out a \"wanted\" poster. Above a photo of Rana pipiens are the words, \"Have You Seen This Frog?\"\nPERHAPS THE NEED TO FIND overarching explanations is encoded in our genes. From the search for a unified field theory of physics, to deconstructing the big bang, to proving that it was a straying asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs, we like definitive theories to explain the phenomena that create and govern life.\nWhat is killing the frogs? In many instances, the answer, as with much of the world's disappearing flora and fauna, is no mystery. Humans are destroying habitats with unprecedented frenzy. Researchers estimate that one-quarter to one-half of the earth's species could be extinct in the next 30 years. Cut down a forest, drain a wetland, build a shopping center, and the local frog species die. No one puzzles as to why Southern California is virtually barren of most of its native frogs.\nThere are other obvious human causes. For one thing, pesticides and herbicides that have been found safe for humans may be devastating to other animals at vulnerable points in their life cycles. For another, in national parks, the Government's fire-suppression policies have greatly accelerated the slow process of marshes becoming woods, thus robbing amphibians of habitat. Then there is the human impulse to rectify nature's oversights. The effect of this is seen in the Sierras. After the last Ice Age, fish did not colonize the high-elevation lakes; frogs did. These lakes have been stocked with nonnative game fish, which feed on tadpoles. This has left many frog populations isolated at higher headwaters, where they have become vulnerable to disease or harsh weather. And when the frogs are wiped out at a site, they can't recolonize it. Frogs themselves can also be the problem: when foreign species are introduced, they can overrun native populations.\nBut nothing explains it all. \"I wish there were a death star to explain it,\" says David B. Wake, from his office at Berkeley, where he is the director of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the University of California. \"I don't see a single toxin, a single virus. My theory is that it's general environmental degradation. That's the worst thing. Frogs are telling us about the environment's overall health. They are the medium and the message.\"\nMost herpetologists recognize that the world will never rally around their cosmetically challenged creatures. Their only hope is to portray frogs as four-legged, bug-eating Cassandras, and pray the prophecy is heard. \"Frogs are in essence a messenger,\" Wake says. \"This is about biodiversity and disintegration, the destruction of our total environment.\"\nThey aren't the only messenger. Visit any well-stocked zoo that identifies endangered animals, and you begin to feel you are walking the corridors of a hospice. Most of these endangered species, from migratory songbirds to rhinoceroses, are dying because of human actions -- from habitat destruction to outright slaughter. Some signals are more mysterious; coral is bleaching out in some of the world's oceans for yet-unknown reasons. But one of the most disturbing things about what's happening to amphibians is that species are disappearing from some of the most remote, pristine places left on the earth -- as if following some synchronized command.\nHerpetologists, with perhaps not the greatest objectivity, say frogs are the ideal creature to reflect the health of the environment. In their view, frogs are living environmental assayers, moving over their life cycles from water to land, from plant-eater to insect-eater, covered only by a permeable skin that offers little shield from the outside world. Over and over, these scientists say amphibians represent the global equivalent of the proverbial canary in the coal mine. \"They're very fragile organisms,\" says William Duellman, director of the Center for Neotropical Biological Diversity at the University of Kansas.\nThere is a paradox in portraying frogs as delicate creatures experiencing a collective case of the evolutionary vapors. After all, in the 200 million years since frogs first surfaced on the earth, they have survived whatever killed the dinosaurs, whatever did in the woolly mammoths and other huge animals that wandered this continent. They have withstood glaciers coming and glaciers going. They have been found everywhere from the Himalayas to the Sonoran desert. It is precisely because frog species have been so historically hardy that scientists now find themselves so baffled -- and alarmed. \"Something is out of balance,\" says James Vial, professor of Wildlife Ecology at Oregon State University. \"The changes in the environment may be more drastic than they appear.\"\nSince Canterbury, David Wake has been a leader of a save-the-frogs movement among his colleagues. That conference three years ago was the first time, he says, \"that a number of us herpetologists expressed our concerns openly to each other.\" And when the herpetologists started talking, they began to realize how much they had in common: for years many of them had been losing the subjects of their lifework. Before Canterbury, the scientists were reluctant to share their bad news with the rest of the world. \"No one wanted to publish on it,\" Wake says. \"It was sort of like a macho thing. 'I can't find frogs. I can't do the job anymore.' \"\nIn 1990, Wake helped organize a symposium on the topic in Irvine, Calif., out of which came the Declining Amphibian Populations Task Force. The group, with headquarters in Corvallis, Ore., was conceived as a three-year project to determine the extent and possible causes of amphibian decline. Operating as a unit of the World Conservation Union in Switzerland, which provides part of the $250,000 budget, the task force now has more than a thousand researchers in 40 countries. The task force is set to expire at the end of next year, but already members are discussing making it a permanent organization. The Frog's Leap Winery in Napa Valley has donated the money for its bulletin: Froglog.\nLike the species they study, herpetologists are solitary, even quirky creatures. Getting the task force organized, deciding how to accomplish its goals -- long-term monitoring or short-term assessment, field research or lab experiments -- took about a year. In the end, the members decided on all of the above.\nOne member of the task force's board, John Wright, the curator of herpetology at the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History, has been a vocal critic of the delays. But even if herpetologists were suddenly to adopt the cooperative social model of, say, ants, Wright would be pessimistic about the future. \"In the real world and the scientific world, someone throws a dollar in the corner and everyone runs to it,\" he says. \"Dollars are being thrown at other corners than biodiversity. If we can't do it with the warm fuzzies -- mammals and beautiful birds, we aren't going to do it with frogs.\" The answer to finding out what's going on with frogs, many herpetologists believe, would be a project documenting the world's species that is akin to the Human Genome Project.\nAn equally challenging problem is the need for herpetologists to move beyond alarming anecdote to absolute proof. Since almost no carefully controlled, long-term studies have been done on frog-population dynamics, can scientists even be sure they are seeing the disaster they think they're seeing?\n\"There is a lot of data on a number of populations taking nose dives over the last 20 years,\" says David Bradford, a wildlife ecologist with the Environmental Protection Agency. \"It's a good record, but it's anecdotal.\"\nUsing frogs as their study species, scientists have focused on exotic subjects like the physiology of living at high altitudes or the genetics of skin coloration. Then their research yielded something unexpected: there were no more frogs to study. Like Cynthia Carey, Bradford watched in the 70's as his study population -- mountain yellow-legged frogs in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks in California -- sickened and died. Ten years later, in 1989, he returned to census 26 of his study sites. He found frogs at one.\nBut a few herpetologists -- a decided minority -- are deeply troubled about the lack of long-term data. After the Canterbury conference, a Rutgers University biologist, Peter J. Morin, recalls: \"I and a number of other people were a little alarmed that the data weren't there to support the conclusions. We need more real data on populations to find out if they are increasing, decreasing or just fluctuating.\" To be conclusive, such studies take 10 to 20 years.\nSome skeptics say the problem isn't too few frogs, but too many frog researchers. It could be called the baby-boom theory of frog decline. The idea is that about 20 years ago graduate schools were filling up with young scientists studying the new biological discipline of population dynamics. \"When people go out to do research projects, they usually pick common organisms,\" says Stephen G. Tilley, professor of biological sciences at Smith College. \"If populations fluctuate, there's a good chance when you go back to look they might not be as common as they were when you first studied them.\" He points out that many animals, like some rodents or insects, have large population swings.\nTilley does believe that some species of frogs, like those in the Sierra Nevada, are in trouble. But he has seen nothing to convince him disappearances around the globe are linked. \"I'm concerned about the species that are documented to have undergone a radical decline,\" he says. \"But I am not convinced they tie together.\"\nMany of the most alarming population crashes, he points out, like those in Costa Rica or Australia, are among species that have been discovered only recently. \"The problem is a lot of the species people are concerned with right now haven't been studied long-term. For all we know, they fluctuate. There's a paper in Science, and the bottom line is when people do long-term studies of amphibian populations, they find they fluctuate a lot.\"\nAt first glance, the Science article does look like a T.K.O. to those crying extinction. From 1978 to 1990, census information was collected for species of three salamanders and one frog at a well-protected two-and-a-half acre pond near the center of the 300-square-mile Savannah River Ecology Laboratory in South Carolina. At the end of those years, breeding populations increased in one species and showed no declines in the others. Nevertheless, during the 12 years themselves, population size fluctuated widely -- one salamander was virtually absent for the first two years of the study, but by 1990, almost 600 females of the species bred.\nBut to the worried herpetologists, the article is equivalent to proving there is no homelessness in Los Angeles by going on a tour of Beverly Hills. They claim to be seeing not fluctuations, but dead drops. David Wake, who wrote a commentary in Science to accompany the article, praises its research and agrees that more long-term data are needed. But he takes no comfort from it, because the Savannah River site is located in an area that is vast and wet and green. \"It's an excellent breeding site,\" Wake says. \"They could have total extinction of a local pond, and it would be recolonized the next year. There's no risk to those animals moving back and forth.\"\nJoseph H. K. Pechmann, an author of the Science article on the Savannah River project, agrees with Wake that, in many ways, his site is unique. \"We would be the first to say the results from one study should not be generalized to the next pond down the road, let alone to a pond halfway around the world,\" says Pechmann.\nBut he adds his own warning: conclusions about a global frog crisis should not be generalized from existing evidence. \"It remains an open question whether declines and disappearances of some frog species in isolated, pristine environments represent a natural fluctuation or some subtle effect of human activities that we don't understand,\" Pechmann says. \"My money is on the natural fluctuations, but I can't prove that. Only further research will say for sure.\"\nNO herpetologist disputes the value of long-term studies. But many insist that to wait for the data to come in would be foolhardy. \"These declines, in many cases, are so catastrophic and are occurring simultaneously in so many parts of the world that we cannot wait for monitoring studies before we express our concern,\" says James Vial of Oregon State University, who is the task force's international coordinator. \"Because if we wait for a prolonged period, there may not be anything left to study.\"\nMany researchers refuse to wait, and are now exploring the possible causes of the mysterious declines -- those not clearly linked to habitat destruction. At the top of the list is an increase in ultraviolet radiation. Among the hardest-hit amphibians are those that live at high altitudes, or near-the-ozone-hole southerly latitudes, from the Rockies and Sierras to the Andes to Australia. High-altitude frogs have already developed strategies to protect themselves from harmful radiation, while absorbing the heat so necessary to their survival. Many highland species lay black eggs and have a black peritoneum and, in the male, black testes. \"This suggests they already live at the edge,\" says Wake. \"How much more does it take to push them over?\"\nWhile there may be indications that those who wear sunblock will inherit the earth, right now it's difficult to prove that increased ultraviolet radiation is a major cause of the decline. The simple reason is that studies have yet to be done to show if UV radiation really is increasing, and there is little historical information. More than a century's worth of temperature and rainfall statistics leaves the very false impression that similar data exist on all other atmospheric phenomena. \"I can't believe how little we know,\" says Wake. \"One reason global climate change is a touchy field is we don't have the right records.\"\nThere is, of course, another species not protected by fur or shell or feathers that seems to be suffering from exposure to the sun's rays. Human skin-cancer rates are rising dramatically around the world. And Wake says we need to heed such warnings. \"I say use biological indicators,\" he says. \"The instruments won't do it. We need to measure effects.\"\nAndrew R. Blaustein, professor of zoology at Oregon State, is using instruments and measuring effects. The National Science Foundation and the National Geographic Society are helping to pay for his three-year, $272,000 study of ultraviolet radiation on amphibians. Blaustein has discovered that in the past four years, there has been a large dying off of western-toad eggs. What is unusual about this is that while very few toads and frogs make it to adulthood, mortality does not normally occur until after the eggs have hatched. \"This year there were about two-and-a-half million eggs,\" Blaustein says. \"Ninety-five percent of them died.\" There have been experiments that show exposure to UV radiation will destroy the development of eggs, but these have been in the laboratory. Blaustein wants to find out what effect current UV radiation levels are having in the field.\nAs for other possible causes, acidification also has its partisans. But for every study that shows acid rain is damaging frogs, another one refutes it. \"I have dismissed it as a factor in the Rocky Mountains,\" says Stephen Corn, a zoologist with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in Fort Collins, Colo., who has just completed an extensive survey of acid rain's effect on western amphibians. And Blaustein, too, can find no evidence of acid in the Cascade Mountain lakes he is studying. \"The acid stuff doesn't fit at all,\" he says. \"We've taken pH measurements for two years. It's totally normal. And in the three lakes we've studied these animals, there are no pollutants.\"\nThe mystery of the frog decline challenges the distinction between what is local and what is global. Because we as a species are so successful, so pervasive, the consequences of our local actions now ripple across the globe. No pristine place can protect a species from hazardous levels of, say, UV radiation. What is happening to frogs calls into question our belief that we can preserve the natural world in small, unsullied pockets. \"You cannot lock up nature,\" Wake says. \"There's no Noah's ark big enough.\"\n\"THEY HAVE BEAUTIFUL eyes. You can really fall in love with them.\"\nCynthia Carey is talking about the large, amber, if rather unexpressive, eyes of the specimen of marine toad now bloating up in the hands of her research assistant, Judy Bissonnette. The bloating, which makes this six-inch toad start to resemble a tiny dirigible, is a natural response to danger. In this case, the danger is being one of a dozen research animals in this small lab room at the University of Colorado at Boulder.\nAlmost 20 years after she first wondered why all the western toads she saw were dying, Carey, who wears a small, silver frog pendant around her neck, is trying to decipher the immune system of frogs. The sick toad she had autopsied many years ago died of a massive infection from the bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila, which is ubiquitous in fresh water. In the final stages of infection, the circulation of a toad or frog will break down, causing hemorrhaging that brings blood to the skin -- thus the common name, red-leg disease. Red-leg, like AIDS, is a condition caused by the collapse of the immune system. A healthy frog should not succumb to massive Aeromonas hydrophila infection, just as a healthy human should be able to fight off the staph and strep infections that can be so devastating to AIDS patients. But unlike AIDS, no one knows what is triggering the toads' immune system breakdown; if it is a pathogen, it remains unidentified.\nDeparting from several of her colleagues who are looking to prove that a specific environmental factor kills frogs outright, Carey says she believes the problem is more complex. Her hypothesis is that a combination of several factors -- be it ultraviolet radiation, acid snow or something yet unknown -- creates a degree of sublethal stress sufficient to cause the cascading breakdown of the immune system.\nWith a $20,000 grant from the National Science Foundation, Carey is figuring out what a healthy toad's immune system looks like. Once she has this basic information, the next step will be to expose toads to acidified water, pesticides, ultraviolet light and rapid temperature change. The object is to try to find out which of these conditions, if any, will induce the collapse of toad immune systems. It's a large undertaking. \"We don't really understand why when you and I get under a lot of stress, and then the stress is over, we immediately get sick. We don't understand that for us, let alone amphibians.\" She can't risk using the remaining western toads for her preliminary experiments -- their population is too fragile. Instead, she buys marine toads, natives of the Gulf Coast, from an animal supply house.\nIn a way, Carey's research is as metaphorical as molecular. What if she does find that what's killing frogs is some mix of global environmental changes? Aren't they really, then, a disturbing sign about the health of the planet's immune system? \"Frogs aren't the only thing disappearing,\" she says. \"The more biological diversity we destroy, the less flexibility we have to create new food sources that can tolerate the environment we are creating.\"\nTHERE WAS THAT unprecedented moment in amphibian history when a frog was America's sweetheart. But Kermit aside, frogs have never been much loved by people. Carolus Linnaeus, the 18th-century Swedish naturalist who developed the classification system of living things, once wrote, \"These foul and loathsome animals are . . . abhorrent because of their cold bodies, pale color, cartilaginous skeletons, filthy skin, fierce aspect, calculating eye, offensive smell, harsh voice, squalid habitation and terrible venom.\"\nFrogs lack the qualities that seem to arouse human passion toward other species -- the wild variety and soaring ability of birds; the cuddliness or majesty of mammals. They are not the subject of riveting nature specials or glossy coffee-table volumes. They are of little economic value. For most urbanites and suburbanites, they are creatures long ago encountered at summer camp, dismembered in high-school lab -- and little thought of again. This distant relationship with humans has made quantifying their disappearance more difficult. Amateur bird watchers, for example, keep records, so there is abundant long-term data showing the decline of migratory songbirds.\nThe first amphibians emerged around 350 million years ago. Depending on what you consider a frog, the first frogs appeared about 200 million years ago during the Triassic period or 180 million years ago during the Jurassic. Amphibians -- the word comes from the Greek \"amphi\" and \"bios\" (living a double life) -- are a bridge between the aquatic and the terrestrial, the link between fish and reptile. They include salamanders as well as frogs and toads.\nHerpetologists have not done a very good public relations job for their creatures; Linnaeus's attitude toward frogs has been passed down through the centuries. \"This popular concept that they are imperfectly adapted, lowly vertebrates is garbage rooted in an archaic vision of evolution,\" says Stephen Tilley of Smith College. \"They are a highly adapted group in their own right. They have extremely complicated behaviors, anatomies, physiologies and reproductive patterns.\"\nThere are about 3,800 known species of frogs and toads that occur on every continent except Antarctica. As with much of life, frogs are more colorful, more diverse and more plentiful in the tropics. For example, the forests of Borneo are host to probably 200 species. Texas, which is of equivalent size, has only about 35. Paradoxically, during the 80's, when the great disappearances were first noticed, there was an explosion in species identification. Twenty percent of South America's frog species were named in that decade. \"I'm just sitting here, looking at material I just brought back from Peru,\" says William Duellman, from his office at the University of Kansas. \"They have apparently two new species of tree frogs that no one has ever collected before.\"\nFor the past 30 years, Duellman has concentrated his research on South and Central America. He has a particular fondness for documenting frogs' astounding breeding strategies -- from marsupial frogs, which carry fertilized eggs in a pouch on their back that develop into tadpoles or froglets, to Darwin's frog, whose males incubate newly hatched tadpoles in their vocal sacs until they emerge as frogs, to a type of dart-poison frog, which deposits her tadpoles in water pooled in bromeliad leaves and then feeds them during their development with her unfertilized eggs.\nWhile Duellman says the frog situation in the environs of the Midwest seems \"copacetic,\" he, too, has been perplexed as South American species he has studied for years appear to be dropping off the face of the earth. \"About 1984 was when I started getting an inkling of declines in frog population in the Andes of Ecuador,\" he recalls. \"You'd have frogs crawling all over one year, then the next year, none. That's pretty dramatic. What we're facing now are indications of a crisis. This is the first time in my tenure as a herpetologist we've seen anything of this type.\"\nTREADING carefully in the muck, Stephen Corn of the Fish and Wildlife Service reaches down and picks up a small, mottled, olive-green and brown creature found nowhere else on earth. This unprepossessing animal is one of the last surviving members of its species, the Wyoming toad. Corn looks at its front foot. \"It's a male,\" he says. In the males of many species the \"thumb\" is dark and calloused-looking, an \"all the better to squeeze you with my dear\" adaptation. During mating, called \"amplexus,\" the male grabs the female and mounts her; from similar-looking orifices, they simultaneously spew either sperm or eggs, which are fertilized outside the female.\nUnfortunately for the future of the Wyoming toad, there have been no breeding females to grab for the past year. Adding to the problem has been an outbreak the past two years of red-leg disease.\nThe toad's Latin name is Bufo hemiophyrs baxteri, after George Baxter, a retired professor of zoology at the University of Wyoming who first discovered the species -- actually a subspecies of the Dakota toad -- in 1946. Over the years, Baxter would take his classes to the dozens of sites of the animal's small range, 100 square miles around Laramie. Then, as the familiar story goes, in the mid-70's Baxter realized he was having a hard time finding his toads. By 1983, no one could find any; they were placed on the endangered species list, and presumed to be extinct.\nBut in 1987, a sharp-eyed fisherman spotted some at a small, stocked fishing lake about 10 miles west of Laramie -- a last, holdout population of about 100 toads. Introduced fish do not seem to be the cause of this toad's demise. These amphibians produce fairly toxic tadpoles, unlike many species whose yet-to-metamorphosize young are prime fish morsels. This year, the Fish and Wildlife Service bought the fishing lake, as well as three nearby lakes and 1,800 acres around them, for about $300,000 -- one of the few Government refuges established for amphibians.\nThe burly, bearded Corn is running an annual census of the toads. Three times last summer, he and a group of biologists came to the lake to capture every toad they could, photograph them and try to match their unique markings with previous toad mug shots. The population is considered too unstable for the more common identifying procedure of toe-clipping, or the new high-tech version being used on a population of western toads in which a transponder the size of a grain of rice is inserted below the skin.\nCorn is pessimistic about the future of Bufo hemiophyrs baxteri. This fall's population was 162, but then his research team found that an estimated one-quarter of the total had been hit by red-leg disease. And in 1989, an unusually cold winter probably killed off many of that year's young. Researchers believe that the female of the species breeds only in the third year of its life, so the 1989 die-off has left a female population that is too young to breed. As Corn holds the toad, a male he estimates was born in 1990, it emits a small, alarmed cheep. \"They cheep when a predator or another male grabs them,\" he explains. \"The breeding call is a low-grade whine.\" The male has had plenty to whine about the last few years. \"This is one that tried to breed this year,\" Corn says, \"but he couldn't find any girls.\"\nSuch population fluctuations, as the Savannah River study shows, may have less serious consequences when there is a larger population of the species available to recolonize a site, but the Wyoming toad has no such backup. \"I think realistically it's a matter of time,\" Corn says.\nAdding to the mystery of the Wyoming toad is the thriving population of chorus frogs that are hopping along in the same muck. This frog, bright green and skinny with dark green stripes, has an intense chirp of a breeding call; in fact, some herpetologists joke that these creatures have caused them some loss of hearing. What is the secret of their success? One irony-rich theory is that chorus frogs have shorter individual life spans than Wyoming toads. That is, they reach maturity and reproduce so quickly that they don't live long enough to succumb to whatever is doing in the toads. But dying young isn't a foolproof method of survival: The chorus frogs of eastern Canada now appear imperiled.\nWHAT WOULD HAPPEN if frogs died out? Understandably, that's a world few herpetologists care to imagine. One consequence, they say, may be a field day for insects; amphibians provide a far safer method for keeping insect populations in check than any chemical insecticide. Bangladesh, where native frogs have been nearly wiped out to appease the French appetite for their legs, appears to be reaping the consequences. \"They now have increased numbers of mosquitoes and malaria,\" William Duellman says. And the indisputable importance of frogs to the food chain is not just a matter of what they eat, but who eats them; they are a major food source for many birds, fish, reptiles and mammals.\nBut herpetologists say that simply saving frogs is not the point. \"We don't know how many species can be lost before the system ceases to function,\" says Richard L. Wyman, adjunct associate professor of biology at the State University of New York at Albany. \"But eliminate enough species and sooner or later it will cease to function. In the past, life responded to change through evolution, and that process depends on genetic diversity. If everything's the same, evolution stops. It's as if we are killing evolution itself.\"\nIn his book on the history of earth's extinctions, \"The Miner's Canary,\" the paleontologist Niles Eldredge writes, \"Extinction resets the evolutionary clock.\" So far, six mass extinctions have reset the earth's evolutionary clock -- like the one that happened at the end of the Cretaceous period that took the dinosaurs with it. And some scientists, including Eldredge and celebrated biologist Edward O. Wilson of Harvard, insist we are in the midst of another cataclysm -- the first to be caused by man.\nLife has never stopped completely, however. A few species have always managed to cross the valley of death, and those that made it to the other side were able to begin the evolutionary process again. In light of that, David Wake is more sanguine about the frogs' future than ours.\n\"They have been here hundreds of millions of years, humans less than five,\" Wake says. \"I have no doubt there are survivors among them. I think they will do better than we will. I am totally convinced that frogs will be here when we are long gone.\""}]
