[{"text": "Furor Over Feminist Writer Leaves Bangladesh on Edge\n1994-07-16T05:00:00.000Z\nAziz ul-Haq, one of the most powerful Muslim leaders in Bangladesh, smiled as he pondered the case of Taslima Nasrin, the feminist writer whose bold, often startling challenges to Islamic taboos on female sexuality and the role of women have shaken this country like a cyclone blowing in from the Bay of Bengal.\n\"If she doesn't come back to the faith, the punishment is clear,\" the 75-year-old Muslim cleric said, as a crowd of bright-eyed boys pressed their noses against an iron grate in the wall separating them from their teacher's sanctuary at the Jamaya Rahmania Arabia madrassah, Dhaka's leading Muslim seminary. \"She should be executed.\"\nSince it broke away from Pakistan 22 years ago, Bangladesh has had more than its share of travails. It has been buffeted by cyclones and floods, and burdened by illiteracy and poverty that place the country's 120 million people among the most disadvantaged in the world.\nIt has been rocked by bloody coups, assassinations and popular uprisings against military dictatorships, although military rulers have held sway, either under martial law or through pliant parliaments, for all but seven years.\nNow, once again, the country seems poised on the edge of turmoil that could engulf the government of Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, the widow of a former military ruler who was assassinated after winning election as President.\nAmid the tensions swirling around Miss Nasrin, who went underground after the Government brought criminal charges against her six weeks ago for allegedly insulting the Muslim faith, Muslim militants have unleashed a battery of strikes and protest rallies in Dhaka, the capital, and in other cities.\nThousands have surged through the streets, echoing Muslim clerics' calls for the writer's head with cries of \"Death, death and only death for the apostate Nasrin!\"\nMilitant leaders have used the turmoil to promote a wide agenda of fundamentalist demands, including calls for Bangladesh to be made an Islamic republic, and for the Muslim penal code, to be imposed as criminal law.\nThey have demanded the expulsion of privately run foreign aid organizations that administer much of the $2 billion the country receives each year in development assistance, describing the agencies' efforts to foster more jobs and education for women, among other projects, as \"decadent\" and \"un-Islamic.\"\nThe demands have come just as international aid agencies have been saying that Bangladesh has begun to turn the corner, with striking gains in primary education for girls, in employment opportunities for women, and in lowering birth rates.\nBut as the social advances have gathered speed, they have met increasing resistance from the male-dominated hierarchies in the villages where 80 percent of Bangladeshis live, particularly from the Muslim clerics at the top of the rural power pyramid.\nUnder a stronger Government, many Bangladeshis opposed to the militants say, the militants could scarcely have hoped to turn the utterances of a writer, even one as controversial as Miss Nasrin, into a platform for creating major political unrest. Educated, urban Bangladeshis insist that the traditions of Bengali Muslims incline toward tolerance, not zealotry, in religious matters.\n\"The Bengali mind is basically secular,\" said Serajul Islam Chowdhury, an English literature professor at the University of Dhaka. \"The mullahs are good men, but we have never wanted them in politics.\"\nInstead of confronting the militants, the Zia Government has seemed eager to placate them.\nThe charge against Miss Nasrin was brought under a little-used statute on religious defamation dating from British colonial days. Cabinet ministers have tried to outdo one another in condemning the writer.\nThe Foreign Ministry's press office has been distributing translations of one of Miss Nasrin's more sexually graphic poems. \"As you can see, it is more or less pornographic,\" a spokesman said.\nThe Prime Minister has maintained silence on the affair, but several of her ministers who discussed the controversy say they are merely carrying out a law designed to prevent the kind of religious violence that has racked India.\n\"We have gone to court to safeguard the feelings of the people, as any civilized country would,\" said the Foreign Minister, Mustafi Zur Rahman. \"Now we leave it to the court. If she convinces them, she walks a free woman.\"\nSenior ministers have acknowledged that they see the controversy over Miss Nasrin as a potential trigger for wider disturbances that could hasten the Government's downfall. Although initially popular in 1991, when it became the the country's first truly civilian administration since 1975, the Zia Government has been weakened by a political stalemate that developed when the entire opposition walked out of Parliament five months ago, vowing not to return until the installation of a neutral \"caretaker\" government empowered to hold new elections. A Political Stand-Off\nThe impasse has led to a competition between Prime Minister Zia and her main rival, Sheikh Hasina Wazed, leader of the Awami League, for the support of the Muslim fundamentalists.\nThe main fundamentalist group in Parliament, the Party of God, originally backed the Prime Minister's party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, allowing it to form a government after the 1991 elections, but it subsequently joined the opposition boycott. Now the Party of God, along with the Awami League, is threatening to broaden the street disturbances. The scale of the turmoil has shaken many here who had taken comfort from the apparent weakness of the Party of God.\nFew can be more shaken than Miss Nasrin, who has struck an almost panic-stricken tone in messages smuggled from her hiding place. \"The mullahs are everywhere,\" she said in a message last month. \"If I stay here, they must kill me.\" Messages From Hiding\nThe messages have been a far cry from the plucky impertinence that turned Miss Nasrin from an obscure physician in a Government clinic into the scarlet woman of Bangladesh. In newspaper columns and novels, in poems and interviews, Miss Nasrin advocated the right of women to choose their sexual partners and to have children outside of marriage. Three times married herself, she has said Muslim women should have the right to have four husbands simultaneously, just as the Koran permits men to take four wives. Her poems are ripe with sexual imagery daring even by Western standards.\nAnger among Muslim militants began to boil over in 1993, after Miss Nasrin wrote a novel, \"Shame,\" published in India as well as Bangladesh,that depicted the fictional sufferings inflicted by Muslim militants on a family of Bangladeshi Hindus.\nThe Zia Government banned the book after it had sold 60,000 copies here, making it a best-seller. It also revoked Miss Nasrin's passport, restoring it after protests from western Governments and writers' groups.\nShe lit the fuse that caused the current upheaval by giving an interview this spring to an Indian newspaper, The Statesman in Calcutta, in which she was reported as saying that the Koran should be \"revised thoroughly.\"\nAs death threats cascaded from Muslim clerics in Bangladesh, Miss Nasrin issued a statement saying that she had been misquoted, a claim denied by The Statesman. Later, she added fuel to the flames with a letter to The Statesman saying that urging the Koran's revision would have been \"irrelevant\" since, like the Bible and other religious texts, it was \"out of place and out of time.\" Little Support from Peers\nAlways a loner, Miss Nasrin made few friends among her fellow writers and intellectuals. Many have been harshly critical, saying that by provoking fundamentalists, Miss Nasrin has endangered causes, including women's rights, that others have worked for years to achieve.\n\"She's been irresponsible in many ways,\" said Khushi Kabir, who heads a private organization, Nijera Kori, meaning \"Do It Ourselves,\" that works for the empowerment of rural women. Miss Kabir said that she had worked for two years in a rural village, and had avoided provoking the local imams despite ignoring Muslim traditions such as the one requiring women to cover their heads.\n\"You learn how to handle these people,\" she said. \"It's something Taslima has never understood.\""}, {"text": "What Success Story?\n1994-09-29T05:00:00.000Z\nIn drawing attention to the need for better family planning and reproductive programs worldwide, the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo this month was proclaimed a great victory for women. A sobering reality, however, has largely been overlooked: some programs held up as models at the conference have actually undermined basic health care and limited women's choices. \nConsider Bangladesh, often cited by population experts as a success story. Bangladesh's fertility rate has declined from seven births per woman in 1975 to fewer than five today -- a considerable achievement in a country that is the world's most densely populated and getting more crowded. Yet population agencies fail to acknowledge the human costs of its aggressive family planning policy.\nWhen I was doing research in rural Bangladesh in 1975, I found that both men and women were interested in birth control but were often unable to get it. Where it was available, it was usually provided without proper instructions or follow-up care. The absence of medical attention was not surprising: at the time there was virtually no primary health care system in the area or in most places outside major cities.\nUnfortunately, that is still true today. Over the last two decades, Bangladesh, encouraged by international development agencies, has embarked on an ill-conceived crusade for population control that has worked against establishing a primary health care system. \nIn the early 1980's, bodies like the World Bank and the U.S. Agency for International Development called for a drastic reduction in Bangladesh's population growth. Those calls led to a heavy-handed campaign that emphasized sterilization over temporary birth control methods and all but neglected basic health care. Women and men were offered cash for being sterilized, health workers received a fee for each client they recruited for sterilization and doctors were paid by the case, encouraging them to rush through operations. \nWomen were the main targets of this campaign, even though sterilization is far less risky for men. A 1983 investigation of government clinics by the World Bank found that doctors operated in appallingly unhygienic conditions and that women sometimes submitted to sterilizations without being told that the operation was permanent. That same year, A.I.D. officials complained to the Bangladeshi Government about reports of a coercive campaign by the army to sterilize women in one poor tribal community who had more than three children. A year later, British development workers discovered that officials in flooded areas were withholding emergency food aid from poor women unless they agreed to be sterilized. \nThe sterilization drive had a devastating impact on the country's fledgling health care efforts. Sterilization fees paid to local health workers, for example, caused them to neglect their other duties. And since the mid-1980's, population control programs have continued to absorb one-third of the country's total health budget.\nConcerns over Bangladesh's record led European donors to press for reform in the mid-1980's. But while sterilization rates have been declining, the operation remains the Government's chief method of population control. And while Bangladeshis now have better access to other methods, they are still rarely provided with adequate medical supervision or follow-up care. \nBangladesh gives the lie to the claim that family planning is the best way to improve women and children's lives. Maternal death rates are still extremely high because there is little decent pregnancy care, and the small improvement in infant mortality is largely due to a childhood immunization drive in the late 1980's and better control of dysentery. \nA comprehensive primary health care system with voluntary family planning would meet Bangladesh's needs far better than its present population control program. Instead of praising the Bangladeshi model, the experts should learn from its mistakes."}, {"text": "Bangladesh and Population : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\n1994-10-11T05:00:00.000Z\nI was dismayed to read Betsy Hartmann's article, \"Population: Bangladesh Is No Model\" (Opinion, Sept. 30), and believe that her information is outdated. I have been involved since 1987 with the family planning program in Bangladesh, where I have lived for the last three years. I just reread the section on family planning in Ms. Hartmann's excellent study of life in a Bangladesh village, \"A Quiet Violence,\" based on her stay there in 1975.\nShe describes the women there seeking her advice on how not to have more children and she mentions the recognition of the village men of the immediate problems caused by overpopulation: increasingly smaller plots of land and less money to spend on food.\nBased on her experience nearly 20 years ago, I find it surprising that she is so critical of a program that has evolved and continues to grow to meet current and future needs. The need and demand for family planning is stronger than ever. Both public and private agencies are committed to the improvement of the quality of care through more and better training of service providers, including emphasis on counseling and informed choice.\nContrary to her statement that sterilization is the government's chief means of \"population control,\" the latest 1993-94 Demographic and Health Survey shows that sterilization has declined slightly over the past 10 years, while the largest single method of choice is the pill. Use of condoms and other methods has doubled in the same period, resulting in the use of contraceptives by more than 45 percent of married couples.\nThe alternative to a strong family planning program in any country is the deterioration of maternal and child health and of nutrition and general well-being due to a lack of access to, and availability of, information and contraceptive options. It is unconscionable to suggest that the priority given to family planning is somehow misdirected. The Bangladesh program is a success story, it is voluntary, and it continues to endeavor to meet the demands of those who request its services.\nEDSON E.

The 58-year-old professor closed the classroom window, then resumed his discourse.\n\"It disrupts you for a while,\" Mr. Chowdhury said as he recounted the incident, which occurred last year. \"But then the gunfire dies down and you get on with the lecture. Academic life continues.\"\nTo gain admission to a university in Bangladesh, where about 70 percent of the 120 million people are illiterate, is an accomplishment in itself. But once here, the 22,000 students on the Dhaka campus, and at other universities, must cope with greater anxieties than exams.\nIn recent months things have been relatively quiet. But campus violence mirrors tensions elsewhere in this desperately poor society, and those tensions have been rising again recently as a result of a bitter confrontation between the Government and opposition parties. Daily Protests\nThe confrontation has led to daily protest marches by rival student groups, but so far there have been no clashes to compare with those earlier in the 1990's, when campus rivalries were often fought out with machine guns and knives. In 1992 more than 80 people were killed on campus.\nThe violence has its origins in rivalries between student wings of the country's major political parties, which have long seen the campuses as important political battlegrounds.\nBut what began as a political contest evolved into gang warfare. When gunfire breaks out these days, it is likely to be prompted by a contest for campus spoils -- perhaps over control of university dormitories, which offer student groups the lucrative power to make room assignments, or for control of protection rackets for campus construction projects, bookstores and food vendors.\nAt the University of Dhaka, where at least 35 students have been killed in the last three years, the killings have been brazen. Student Leader Was Slain\nIn an attack in 1992, a 28-year-old student leader belonging to the campus wing of the governing Bangladesh Nationalist Party was chased into the administration building by two rivals who had accused the victim of hoarding profits from campus rackets. After shooting the man in the head, the killers strolled out.The assailants were arrested, then freed.\nThe Government has deployed special police units on the campuses. But critics say that the police squads have been reluctant to act. On one occasion, rival gangs were engaged in a shootout near a primary school on the campus. Witnesses said the police team summoned to the scene limited itself to asking the gangs to \"please hold your fire until the pupils have cleared the area.\"\n\"Then they sat and watched while the gun battle resumed,\" Mr. Chowdhury, said.\nSustaining student enthusiasm in a country that has few jobs to offer graduates has never been easy. But as violence has grown, morale has plunged. Classes have been canceled for weeks at a time. For many students, exams are deferred so long that degrees that normally take four years can take six or more.\n\"People see all this, and they become apathetic,\" said Mizanur Rahman, a 23-year-old sociology student. \"They say, if this is what university life is all about, what is the point?\" Families Make Sacrifices\nMr. Rahman, whose father is a cloth trader in the northern city of Thakurgaon, is typical of the Dhaka students, coming from a family that must make deep sacrifices to pay costs of about $30 a month, in a country where the annual per capita income is barely $150.\n\"When my learning is disrupted, I feel guilty,\" Mr. Rahman said. \"My father has worked so hard to send me here, and his hopes for me are so high.\"\nCritics of the Government say stronger action would have been taken were it not for the fact that many of Bangladesh's better-off families, including most leading politicians, send their children abroad for their education.\nAlso, politicians are said to fear the power of the student groups, which played a crucial role in the agitation that led to the downfall of H. M. Ershad, a former general who ruled for 10 years, until 1990, before bowing to strikes and protests that paralyzed the country. Mr. Ershad is serving a 20-year sentence for corruption.\nIf any group can end the violence, it may be the students themselves. Every day, the busiest place on campus is Madhu's Canteen, a one-story, rain-stained building looking over an open space that has been the scene of many shootouts. As kettles of sugary tea are shuttled to the tables, students gather for discussion, and the killings are a common topic.\n\"We are trying heart and soul to form a consensus against terrorism on the campus,\" said Mohammad Hassan Chowdhury, a 28-year-old English literature graduate who acknowledges that the political group he leads includes armed militants. But Mr. Chowdhury said that the effort to create \"a clean organization\" was an uphill struggle.\n\"We are a poor, undeveloped third-world country which has suffered from a repeated history of military rule,\" he said. \"This has bred a culture of force and violence, and not only on the university campuses, but everywhere. It will take many years to solve.\""}, {"text": "Cold Hearts in France\n1994-10-27T05:00:00.000Z\nWhat is a country to do when it prides itself on being \"a land of asylum\" -- a haven for the persecuted, dedicated to human rights -- yet feels threatened by a flood of hundreds of thousands of refugees?\nI am not talking about the United States but about France. These painful questions have become urgent here, too, and the wrenching demands of conscience versus expediency have brought the Government under attack.\nThe source of the biggest trouble is Algeria, which is as much a part of France's backyard as Haiti is of America's, although the French don't say that. Of course Algeria is no hapless Haiti but rather a big oil producer and major French trading partner. And it is shuddering on the brink of civil war. Estimates vary from 10,000 to 30,000 people killed since the conflict began nearly three years ago, after elections were canceled because the Government feared that the Islamic fundamentalists would win.\nA particularly nasty feature of the warfare is the assassination of intellectuals and foreigners by armed fundamentalist groups. The toll rises almost daily; it has reached 22 journalists and 64 expatriates, many of them French. It seems to be an adaptation of the Che Guevara strategy of fomenting revolution by murders that will provoke government reprisal and thus sharpen public anger against those in power.\nFrance has warned its citizens to leave Algeria unless their presence is essential, in effect bowing to the fundamentalists' determination to drive foreigners out and thus weaken the economy's links outside.\nBut France has virtually stopped giving visas to Algerians whose lives are threatened and who want even temporary refuge.\nThis has aroused an outcry in France, particularly among intellectuals who feel obliged to show their disgust at lethal attacks on the arts and freedom of speech, and their solidarity with the victims.\nApart from Algeria, the occasions for their outrage are frequent. Taslima Nasrin, the Bangladeshi writer who fled to Sweden because of a fatwa calling for her death, was invited to appear on a French television show but refused the Government's humiliating offer of a visa limited to 24 hours. Its excuse was that she was such a big security risk. Publicly denounced for hypocrisy and cowardice, the Interior Ministry relented and promised her a week's visa \"once the security situation permits.\"\nOfficials are loath to make exceptions for fear of an outpouring of refugees as the Algerian war intensifies and of a sudden increase in France's Muslim population. Islam is already the second religion in France, and some of its rules and practices conflict with French laws and customs.\nTraditionally, France treats migrants as individuals, to be offered assimilation and protected from persecution. French moral principle and prospects for social harmony argue for relying on the country's egalitarian educational system to promote assimilation, and to apply laws on the basis of individuals, not groups.\nBut there are political pressures from the right wing, which blames the migrants for crime, unemployment and abuse of welfare. The Government, trying to avoid losing support to the right, has made concessions to these views.\nThat's a mistake. The answer has to be to continue to offer refuge, to preserve national pride in inclusiveness and the welcome to citizenship.\nThe right incites fears about loss of French identity. But that identity is founded on \"liberty, equality, fraternity.\" It would be lost if that base were undermined."}, {"text": "Violent Weather Battering Globe In Last 2 Years Baffles Experts\n1994-05-24T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE extreme weather of the last two years in North America is part of a worldwide pattern, scientists say, and they are searching hard for an explanation.\nThe United States has suffered through the extra-cold summer that chilled the Northeast in 1992; Hurricane Andrew in August 1992, the most destructive American hurricane ever; the East Coast \"storm of the century\" in March 1993; the devastating flooding in the upper Midwest last summer; and the seemingly unending snows of early 1994 in the Northeast, accompanied by record warmth in the West.\nAll are part of a global pattern of sharper climatic swings over about the last decade, say climatologists. Around the world, the 1980's and early 1990's were remarkable for the \"frequency and intensity of extremes of weather and climate,\" Dr. John Houghton, a co-chairman of an international group of scientists advising the United Nations on climate change, says in a new book, \"Global Warming: The Complete Briefing\" (Lion Publishing, Oxford, England).\nOne tempting explanation for the extreme weather would be to ascribe it to the start of global warming, the feared climate change that could be brought about by emissions of heat-trapping industrial waste gases. Computer models of global climate predict more violent weather as the atmosphere heats up. But most climatologists say the small amount of warming seen so far could well lie within the normal limits of the climate's variability. And whatever the cause of the warming, it may or may not be responsible for the recent climatic extremes, says Dr. Houghton: \"We have no means of knowing, actually.\"\nIf global warming cannot be blamed for the recent blast of violent weather, scientists must turn to the usual suspects, such as the circulation of air currents, the positioning of storm systems and the distribution of heat and moisture. These are the factors that determine weather on a local and regional scale, and the puzzle is to see if there is some new interconnection that has driven them to their recent round of assaults.\nWhile scientists have no definitive answers, some clues have come their way. They have found, for instance, that some large-scale patterns of air circulation may come and go in a rough kind of cycle. The average winter course of the North American jet stream, along which storms develop, has recently shifted from a relatively straight west-to-east path across the continent to a curvier one that dips south from the Pacific Northwest into the central part of the country and then turns upward through the Middle Atlantic states.\nThis curvier pattern allows colder, wetter weather to plunge down into the Northeast and warmer, drier weather to thrust upward into the West. The jet stream broke sharply from a flatter pattern in the late 1950's and the curvy pattern has predominated ever since, according to studies by Dr. Daniel J. Leathers of the University of Delaware and Dr. Michael A. Palecki of the State University of New York at Buffalo. Variations on the pattern are believed partly responsible both for last winter's many snowstorms in the Northeast and for a period of more intense northeasters in the Middle Atlantic states.\nThe pattern is itself linked to sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, and especially to the behavior of one of the globe's most powerful weather makers: the cycle featuring El Nino, a quasi-periodic oscillation in which temperatures in the tropical Pacific rise above average, then fall below it over irregular periods of two to seven years. The changes in ocean temperature touch off long-distance atmospheric chain reactions that alter patterns of air circulation and often bring drought or excessive rains to various parts of the world. El Nino, the warming phase of the cycle, is believed to have been a factor in causing last year's Midwestern floods. Snippet of Understanding\nEl Nino events have become relatively more frequent in the last 15 to 20 years, and Dr. Leathers and Dr. Palecki found that the curvy North American jet stream comes and goes in an approximate rhythm with them and other changes in Pacific sea surface temperatures.\nSimilar processes may be at work in other parts of the globe. But all of this amounts to a snippet of understanding, given the vast complexity of the climate system. What seems clearer is that the system has been serving up more extremes and greater variability over the last decade or so.\nDr. Houghton cites insurance-industry figures that show that the number of catastrophic windstorms worldwide in the 1980's was 29 -- more than double the 14 of the 1970's, which had in turn increased from the 8 of the 1960's. Insured losses from these storms have increased tenfold since the 1960's. Some of the increase is related to more people living in the storm-struck areas, but much of it \"seems to have arisen from the increased storminess in the late 1980's and early 1990's,\" Dr. Houghton says. Moreover, floods and droughts have been going to extremes as well, he says.\nSome of the extreme weather may be linked to El Nino, Dr. Houghton, chief executive of the Meteorological Office of Britain until his retirement in 1991, and other climatologists say. A 1982-83 El Nino event was one of the strongest on record and caused climatic devastation from California to South America to Australia. An unusually cold turn of the cycle, the opposite side of the coin that has been named La Nina, has been tied, though inconclusively, to both the Bangladesh floods and the Midwestern drought of 1988. And an especially protracted El Nino, lasting for three years and ending only in the last few months, has been implicated, at least partly, in some of the more recent climatic behavior.\nOne obstacle to further understanding of weather cycles is that good records go back only to the 1940's, said Anthony Barnston, a senior analyst at the National Weather Service Climate Analysis Center at Camp Springs, Md. It could be, he said, that \"it's run of the mill that we have these decade-to-decade changes in variability,\" but there is no good way to tell.\nSome parts of the climate system, like the El Nino-La Nina cycle, vary on less than a decade's scale and are easier to analyze. Scientists have pinned down pretty well how the cycle affects weather in various parts of the globe through \"teleconnections,\" or chains of cause and effect that ripple through the atmosphere as a result of tropical ocean warming or cooling. But they can only approximate when the cycle will turn, and sometimes, as with everyday weather predictions, they are wrong.\nThe chief reason is chaos, the inherent unpredictability of weather systems that thwarts attempts at long-range forecasts. Forecasters are attempting to deal with the chaos in the El Nino cycle by running many different computer simulations that predict a range of outcomes. If many of the outcomes are in a narrow cluster suggesting that an El Nino event is on the way, then that \"tilts the roulette table\" in favor of such a prediction, said Dr. Mark Cane of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, a pioneer in El Nino forecasting.\n\"If we had the tools we have now, we might have been able to say months or a year ahead that there was a better than even chance\" of a strong El Nino in 1982 and 83, he said. \"We could have said there's such a big tilt to the table\" that people in areas affected by the climatic ripples emanating from El Nino should take precautions, he added.\nMr. Barnston said a slight majority of forecasters at the Climate Analysis Center believes that the tropical Pacific, after three years of warm El Nino conditions, is moving into a mild cold period characteristic of La Nina. That phase is usually associated with warm winters in the Southeastern United States, colder than normal winters from the Great Lakes to the Pacific Northwest, unsettled winters in the Northeast and Middle Atlantic states and, maybe, summer drought in the country's midsection.\nBy changing the distribution of storms over the ocean, El Nino creates warmer conditions in the Western United States and cooler ones in the Northeast -- the exact pattern of last winter. This effect has tended to be more prevalent since about 1976, when a period of relatively more frequent El Nino events began, said Dr. Kevin Trenberth, a climate researcher at the Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. \"What happened this past winter in some sense was another example that fits into that particular phase,\" he said.\nClimatologists are only beginning to try to understand how all the factors influencing climate fit together. Many are sure, however, that global greenhouse warming, if and when it happens, will alter atmospheric circulation by creating heat imbalances on the planet's surface: the ocean warms more slowly than the land.\nIt cools more slowly, too, as when Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines erupted in 1991, cooling the earth by casting aloft sulfate droplets that reflected sunlight. Some climate researchers believe this imbalance affected weather patterns by altering atmospheric circulation, but they have not yet pinned this down.\nMany climatologists believe further that a warmer world will increase the evaporation of ocean water and thereby the number and intensity of storms. Floods, droughts and storms, in other words, would be the likely signature of global warming. And that violent regime could be triggered, some fear, by just a small warming of global climate.\nBut for now, climatologists are in a dense fog as to whether the current phase of violent weather is a harbinger of a warming planet or just a normal fluctuation of the global climate."}, {"text": "Asian Population Growth Is Overtaking Rice Output\n1994-03-18T05:00:00.000Z\nThe race to avoid a collision between population growth and rice production in Asia goes on, amid worrying signs that gains of the recent past may be lost over the next few decades.\nIn the past quarter-century, populations of countries where rice is a staple food grain have increased by an average of 70 percent, but this increase was matched by higher yields, thanks to the spread of new rice technology. Global rice production doubled, world rice prices fell by more than 40 percent and per capita rice consumption rose by an average of 25 percent.\nBut while the populations of major rice-consuming nations continue to swell, growth in rice production has slowed dramatically in the 10 countries that account for 85 percent of global output. If these trends continue, demand for rice in many parts of Asia will outstrip supply within a few years.\nChanges in diets in some industrializing nations, where people are eating less rice, will not alter this trend.\nAlleviation of poverty is an additional force behind the rising demand for rice. Millions of Asians and Africans still have rice only once a day, if at all. The need for rice will be an estimated 70 percent higher in 2025 than it is today. Yields must more than double just to maintain current consumption levels. They must increase still more if malnutrition and poverty in Africa and South Asia are to be overcome.\nYet complacency seems to be growing. In some places, attention is shifting from raising productivity to protecting natural resources. Donor agencies are allocating more of their limited research funds to projects that aim to conserve the natural resource base. Less money is directed to projects designed to raise food production. Both are needed, in a mutually supporting framework.\nPolicymakers in less developed countries are also shifting emphasis. Many governments are withdrawing subsidies from fertilizers and other agricultural supplies. They are reducing investments in water-resource development and agricultural research and extension. They are adopting programs that promote crop diversification at the expense of food production. Financing to develop and maintain the irrigation and drainage systems that helped spread modern strains of rice in the 1960s and 1970s has fallen dramatically.\nDeclining real prices on the world market have added to the complacency about rice production. But world trade involves a mere 4 percent of global output. International price trends do not reflect the shaky balance between overall supply and demand. For example, China and India consume 55 percent of world rice supplies. If a series of natural disasters forced either country to import just a small fraction of national demand, international rice prices would rise substantially.\nGrowth in rice output in the last 30 years has been achieved primarily by increasing yield. But yield gains appear to be flattening. Reversing that trend will not be easy.\nThe equation is complicated by a reduction in the area of rice cultivation. Prime rice land is being lost to industrialization and urbanization in the faster-growing Asian countries. In the 1980s, the harvested area of rice declined in China, Japan, Burma and the Philippines.\nIf environmental concerns result in policies that remove marginal lands from rice production and hasten the shift from intensive to less intensive cropping systems, the area under rice cultivation will decline even faster. This will intensify pressure to raise yields to meet the anticipated increase in demand.\nIrrigated rice accounts for almost 75 percent of the total. Most farmers plant high-yielding modern varieties, and output is approaching the ceiling attainable through modern scientific techniques. For the last three decades, yields in Japan and South Korea have fluctuated between 6 and 6.5 tons per hectare (2.5 acres). Yields in China, on the main Indonesian island of Java and in Punjab and Tamil Nadu in India will soon reach that level.\nIn the tropics, the gap between yields and experimental yield potential is still large because of such natural forces as floods, droughts, heavy rainfall and salinity.\nMost of the increase in rice yields in the favorable environments of the last 25 years was achieved by planting genetically improved varieties designed to respond well to chemical fertilizer and agrochemicals. What is needed is a new generation plant type as well as cropping technology that relies less on inputs from off the farm and more on knowledge-based management to maintain the natural resource while raising yields.\nStudies show that per capita rice consumption depends largely on income. Rice is a luxury for the world's poorest. They rely more on low-cost foods: coarse grains and sweet potatoes. When their incomes rise, their rice consumption goes up. Rice becomes less important only when incomes increase to a point where people can afford meat, fish, bread and vegetables.\nIn Asia, per capita rice consumption has declined only in high- and middle-income countries, such as Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand. The income threshold at which higher-quality, more varied foods are substituted for rice has not yet been reached for China, India, Indonesia and Bangladesh - which account for 70 percent of world rice consumption and dominate growth in demand for rice.\nThe writer, head of the Social Sciences Division at the International Rice Research Institute based in Los Ba\u00f1os, Philippines, contributed this comment to the Herald Tribune."}, {"text": "Plan to Clean Holy River Fails to Stem Tide of Filth\n1994-10-18T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE stench of chemicals, leather, rotting flesh and stale air overwhelms visitors to Jajmau, a neighborhood on the edge of Kanpur, home to 175 tanneries on the southern bank of the Ganges River. A brief shower converts the little enclave of bumpy roads and semipaved lanes, lined with hides and bark used for dyeing, into a squalid mess.\nFor decades, industrial effluents from the leather factories here, including toxic heavy metals such as chrome, and millions of gallons of untreated domestic sewage have spewed into the Ganges from hundreds of cities, towns and villages along the river's 1,560-mile journey through the sprawling northern Indian plains.\n\"In many parts it is nothing less than a sewer,\" said Mahesh Mehta, India's most prominent environmental lawyer, whose litigation forced 60 tanneries in this city of about 2.5 million people to close in the late 1980's because they were releasing untreated effluents into the Ganges.\nThe relentless pollution has caused the slow poisoning of one of the world's great rivers, contaminating drinking water and destroying marine life. The river, which has seen the rise and fall of civilizations, is considered holy by Hindus and its banks are home to millions of people in India and Bangladesh.\nSuch conditions can also lead to epidemics of communicable diseases, health specialists said. Doctors and environmentalists cited poor sanitary conditions, especially a failure to dispose of garbage, as one reason for the recent outbreak of pneumonic plague at Surat in western India.\nAbout 10 years ago, a group of government scientists and politicians, led by Rajiv Gandhi, then the Prime Minister, grew appalled by the river's condition and decided to do something about it. They drew up an ambitious two-stage, 10-year plan to clean up the river and identified 29 cities as the main polluters.\nBut the elaborate plans to build a network of sewage treatment plants for industrial and domestic waste have gone awry. An estimated 3.6 billion rupees, or about $100 million, has been spent, but scientists note that many sewage treatment plants are not in place or working. The second phase has not yet begun and officials say it could be delayed by several years.\nCosts are escalating and even top officials acknowledge that the Ganga Action Plan, as the Indian Government's project is called, is falling apart amid charges of widespread corruption, inefficiency and delays.\nOn Oct. 7, the Supreme Court sharply reprimanded Vinay Shankar, the director of the project, for its failure to improve the river's health and ordered a halt to funds for the second phase of the project. An estimated $140 million was to have been invested in this stage of the cleanup.\n\"The conditions of the river at Kanpur are a disaster, there is no question about it,\" said India's Environment Minister, Kamal Nath. But he defended the Government's efforts, saying that at the start of the project \"we were totally clueless\" about the conditions in and along the river and now more is known about the scale of the crisis. Yet Mr. Nath acknowledged that cash-strapped towns and cities as well as the multiplicity of agencies were slowing the project.\nSuch is the magnetism and symbolism of the river that millions of Hindus visit pilgrim sites along its course every year and collect its water in jars to take home. According to Hindu belief, the river springs from the matted hair of the god Shiva, and Hindus sprinkle Ganges water at religious occasions.\nIn addition millions use the banks of the river, as it flows across three Indian states before entering Bangladesh, for bathing and washing livestock as well as dishes and clothes. But it is also a site for defecating and dumping corpses, and at places the coliform bacteria count in the water is nearly 20 times the permissible limit, and dissolved oxygen, a sign of marine health, is well below acceptable levels.\nSince the growth of industrialization and agriculture, especially after India gained independence from Britain in 1947, the Ganges has increasingly been used as a source of fresh water for industrial plants and irrigation. In addition, it has continued to bear a load of domestic waste. This problem is part of a bigger crisis: of more than 3,000 cities in India with populations of 100,000 or more, barely 200 have basic sewage treatment facilities.\nWith large canals diverting its water to hydroelectric and irrigation projects from Hardwar, the point where it sweeps into the plains, the force of the river has slackened, except during the annual monsoon rains, when it is wide and strong.\nThe changes in its natural course and flow, scientists say, have reduced its ability to regenerate marine life and cleanse itself. In many parts, the population of fish has fallen sharply because of the rising effluent level.\nThe scale of the problem is seen at Sheikpur village, barely one mile east of Jajmau, where villagers have used the river since ancient times.\n\"These days it is big because of the rains and the flood, but in the summer months, between March and June, you cannot bathe, it is so filthy, it stinks and it is blackened by the effluents,\" said Ram Prasad, a farmer, as he stood waist-deep in the waters.\nOne source of pollution is the dumping of human corpses into the river by people who cannot afford to cremate them. Hindus cremate their dead and the city's electric crematorium, built under the Ganga Action Plan to conserve timber and for more efficient use of energy, is little used.\nMany still prefer to burn their dead on expensive wood pyres, which they buy from local merchants. Half-burned bodies frequently turn up downstream, said villagers at Sheikpur.\n\"Our bodies itch after bathing,\" said Mr. Prasad. \"There are many diseases such as dysentery, tapeworm, malaria.\" He and others in the village of 400 people said they bathed again with fresh water from wells after saying their prayers and washing themselves in the Ganges.\nFarther down the river, turtles have been released at the pilgrim city of Varanasi to prey on human and animal corpses. This is believed to be the first time in the world that these creatures are being used as scavengers.\nDilip Biswas, chairman of India's Central Pollution Control Board, said as much as 84 percent of the pollution in the Ganges is from domestic waste. Mr. Biswas, a chemical engineer who prepared the first document on the proposed cleanup a decade ago, said that the core of the crisis lay in solid waste management.\nMr. Biswas, whose spacious office in New Delhi is near an open, stinking sewer channel, said that another major problem was the lack of commitment and involvement of the state governments and cities covered by the plan.\n\"All our attention should be on just managing basic sanitation, meeting those basic human needs so that people do not use the banks as an open toilet,\" he said. \"The industries we can tackle, the laws can be enforced, but the city administrations and towns say they have no funds to pay their workers, and they cannot install and get sewage treatment plants to work.\"\nMost state politicians in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, India's most heavily populated states, and West Bengal, the third state through which the Ganges flows, have shown little interest in making the plan work, say officials here and in New Delhi.\n\"It's seen as a Delhi plan with funding from the center,\" said one top Indian official. \"The money is given from one government department to another and the bureaucrats at the top are not interested, let alone committed.\" He said that contracts were awarded to \"friendly\" builders and project funds shared between corrupt officials and the contractors.\nThe National Environmental Engineering and Research Institute, an independent body of scientists that was asked by the Supreme Court to examine official claims of progress, reported that \"many of the waste treatment systems covered under the Ganga Action Plan are either not constructed, not commissioned or nonfunctional.\"\nIt said that a majority of the 29 cities were still discharging raw sewage directly into the river.\nAbdullah Khan, co-director of an Indo-Dutch project that is one of the plan's few successes with waste water treatment, said the main problems have been \"a lack of financial accountability, a lack of external consultants who can keep the pressure on the official agencies and a flawed implementing mechanism.\"\nMr. Khan said that there was no sense of public involvement either. \"There has been no attempt at educating the people about what is being attempted and what their own role can be,\" he said.\nBut in two Indo-Dutch projects that have succeeded in Uttar Pradesh, engineers devised a major effluent treatment plant that drew the waste water from the tanneries at Jajmau and mixed it with raw sewage that had been allowed to build up biological agents that can absorb some of the toxins. The evil-smelling mixture is then pumped to sludge ponds and a sprawling landfill.\nYet, this process has its limits: it can handle less than one-eighth of Kanpur city's waste effluents. The remainder either still goes into the river or is pumped to farms on the banks of the river through irrigation canals and used to fertilize hundreds of acres of soil.\n\"Ultimately, it still ends up in the Ganga but is a slightly less lethal form,\" said P. K. Mirashe, an environmental engineer with the Central Pollution Control Board here.\nIn addition to the large effluent plant here, the Indo-Dutch program has succeeded in installing chrome recovery plants at six of the biggest tanneries in Jajmau. As a result, the tanneries can recycle large amounts of chromium that would otherwise have been wasted.\nBut most of the medium and small tanneries have refused to install chrome recovery plants, saying they are too expensive. Plans are being made for a common chrome recovery plant.\nAnd although most of the tanneries have primary treatment plants, which take care of as much as 60 percent of the heavy metals, environmentalists say that these are not always operated. .\nIndustrialists say that they are often made a scapegoat by environmentalists and the Government. \"Often we need new technologies,\" said Ehsan Kareem, the chairman of Super House Limited, one of the biggest leather corporations here. \"We cannot absorb all the costs of change, especially the small tanners.\"\nOne sign of the crisis is the greenish drinking water -- the color comes from the chrome -- that flows out of hand pumps in the heart of Kanpur. \"If you cannot supply clean drinking water to a city of 2.5 million, then what are the chances of cleaning up the Ganges upon which hundreds of millions of people depend for their livelihood?\" asked one government environmental engineer."}, {"text": "Population Debate: The Premises Are Changed\n1994-09-14T05:00:00.000Z\nDespite the lingering discord at the end of the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo yesterday, few experts disagree that the meeting, and the social changes its debates reflected, have altered many of the premises for dealing with the crisis of too many people on earth.\nThe phrase \"population control\" is gone from the official vocabulary, and with it several decades of policies that relied on targets or quotas, goals that often went unmet because women in poor countries had little say in family planning. At their most extreme, some policies were and occasionally still are life-threatening or coercive, such as the sterilization and abortion programs of India and China.\nIn its final \"plan of action,\" adopted yesterday by more than 150 nations, the conference accepted that many women and men, if given adequate information, health care and access to a wide choice of contraceptive methods, will very often make having fewer children a priority. Condom Effort Failed\nIn much of South Asia, high fertility rates often reflect the kind of contraception that is available. In Pakistan, mass distribution of condoms failed to effect a change in births, in large part because women in traditional Islamic families had no power to make men use them.\nIn neighboring India, with the largest numerical population growth of any nation, illiterate village women in Rajasthan, a state with high fertility rates, said they knew all about family planning but had only one contraceptive choice: sterilization. They avoided this because they feared serious infection or even death from unsafe operations carried out in unsanitary settings.\nIn other Indian states, notably Kerala and Tamil Nadu, fertility rates are lower in areas where choices are greater, women are better educated and health care is more readily available to all.\nIn Indonesia, enthusiasm for family planning grew and fertility rates declined when the Government began to promote wider choices of methods, said Haryono Suyono, the State Minister for Population, in an interview in Cairo. Local women were brought into clinics as counselors, which inspired confidence, he said. New Power for Women\nIf the donors who contribute the bulk of aid in family planning follow through on the conference's recommendations, \"women will really be collaborators,\" said Ellen Chesler, the author of a biography of Margaret Sanger, who pioneered birth control in the United States.\n\"Money will be spent in tremendously different ways than it has been spent in the past,\" she said in an interview yesterday. \"What is key now is how this plays out. We have to take this language and impose it on foreign assistance acts.\"\nOfficials of several donor governments and international organizations said in Cairo that aid could be directed to family planning and health programs in which women take part in decision-making. Donors are also expected to expand relationships with nongovernmental organizations that work directly with women at the village level.\nIn Washington, the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues plans to introduce provisions in foreign aid bills that would require the Agency for International Development to insure that women's groups participate in any programs supported by the United States. The leading sponsors are Rep. Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado, and Rep. Constance Morella, Republican of Maryland.\nAmong the social changes influencing the tone of the Cairo conference were an expansion of the middle class and a rise in the number of women in the paid labor force in many developing nations, said Ms. Chesler, a director of the International Women's Health Coalition, a New York-based organization that assists women's health groups in poor countries.\nThose trends, along with a growing propensity in Roman Catholic and Muslim countries to disregard religious rules prohibiting or curtailing contraception, contributed to the increasing demands for family planning as a personal right.\nNot all women's groups in the developing world are pleased with the Cairo plan. Some are concerned that calls for action on population growth will translate into new conditions attached to aid for poor countries.\nSome say that the burden of limiting population still falls on the poor, while the richer industrialized nations are a greater danger to the earth and its environment because of their disproportionate consumption of natural resources and contribution to pollution.\nMs. Chesler said that such criticism often grows from a perception that policy changes involving women are the work of Western feminists. Yet many of the women who spoke out in Cairo on reproductive rights were from developing nations, she said. Those women also helped draft the plan of action. 'Comprehensive Document'\nAllan Rosenfield, dean of the School of Public Health at Columbia University, who has been involved in family planning debates and policymaking for several decades, described the conference plan of action as \"the most comprehensive document to come out of this kind of meeting.\"\nHe welcomed the Vatican's conciliatory if still dissenting comments in Cairo yesterday.\n\"Given the strong and difficult rhetoric on all sides going into this meeting -- if the Vatican has really heard the commitment of all these nations to the seriousness of the population, environment, and development issues and the dramatic importance of the status of women, the empowerment of women and the reproductive health of women -- then that's hopefully a breakthrough in the Vatican's relationship with these kinds of programs,\" Dr. Rosenfield said in an interview yesterday.\nIf bringing women to the center of family planning was the major change in the deliberations of this conference, the third conference on population to be held by the United Nations since 1974, the diminution of religious authority in debates on abortion and sex was an equally strong theme.\nTo a large extent, theology and ideology were relegated to the periphery, leaving the Vatican, conservative Islamic scholars and some outspoken third-world political critics of industrial nations in a minority.\nDelegations from several developing nations representing a range of beliefs and political philosophies welcomed what Egypt's Foreign Minister, Amr Moussa, characterized as a final consensus. 'Meeting of All Cultures'\n\"This conference was a meeting of all cultures and civilizations and it has succeeded in adopting a text which was composed by a blend of religions, values and traditions,\" Mr. Moussa told the final session.\nMs. Chesler took a stronger view. \"I think this conference can be seen as ending 2,000 years of ecclesiastical authority or jurisdiction over marriage and women's lives,\" she said. \"Medicine and science, not religion and belief, will govern family planning.\"\nThe conference's plan of action is aimed at stabilizing world population at 7.27 billion by 2015. Without active measures, the world could have nearly 8 billion people by then and 12.5 billion or more by 2050, according to United Nations estimates. More than 90 percent of the growth is coming from the poorest countries.\nThroughout the developing world, however, lobbies oppose many programs of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and industrial donor nations because they may involve demands for policy changes from recipient governments. For these critics of international aid, dangers lie in the Cairo action plan.\nGayatri Chakravorty Spivak, the Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities at Columbia University, who devised and directs literacy programs for village women in rural Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal, reflects that view. She is critical of the large and increasingly powerful nongovernmental organizations that played major roles in drafting the Cairo plan.\nProfessor Spivak, who attended the conference, said yesterday that she feared the action plan leaves room for coercive population policies to continue or even expand. International pharmaceutical companies may now assume they have license to flood poor countries with contraceptives, she warned, making women a \"dumping ground\" for their products."}, {"text": "The World;A Writer Hides. Her Country Winces.\n1994-07-31T05:00:00.000Z\nIN the weeks when the world's soccer nations were competing for the World Cup, the favorite topic among Bangladeshis was the performance of Brazil. Perhaps because Brazil is in some ways similar to Bangladesh -- crowded, and for the most part desperately poor -- people all across this nation draped their homes with Brazil's green-and-yellow flag. When Brazil won the championship, crowds danced in the streets.\nBut this Bangladesh, striking for its spontaneity and good will, is not the Bangladesh familiar in the West. The Bangladesh that has been capturing attention there is a country where crowds of angry Muslims have been demanding the death of a writer accused of blaspheming the Koran. The images have been all the more stark for the fact that the writer, Taslima Nasrin, is a woman, who reacted to the death threats by fleeing to an undisclosed hideout and issuing anguished appeals to Western governments to save her life.\nNearly two months later, Ms. Nasrin remains in hiding, negotiating through her lawyers for an arrangement under which she can leave Bangladesh for refuge in a Western country. But before this can be done, a deal must be worked out under which Ms. Nasrin answers the Government's criminal charge that she defamed the Muslim faith. The charge, brought under a law drawn up by Britain when it was the colonial power in India, can bring a penalty of two years in prison.\nFor Western governments, writers' groups and human rights organizations, Ms. Nasrin's flight to the West would be a successful end to the affair, assuming that extremists here did not stir Muslims abroad to violence against her. It is this fear, among other things, that has led to comparisons with Salman Rushdie, the Indian- born writer who remains under round-the-clock police guard in Britain years after Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called on Muslims to kill him for what the ayatollah deemed blasphemy against Islam.\nBut even if Ms. Nasrin finds safety in the West, the matter will have lasting repercussions here. Among other things, Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's Government will face the consequences of the concession it made, in bringing the defamation charge, to the Muslim clerics who have led the campaign against Ms. Nasrin. Many here, including senior ministers in Mrs. Zia's cabinet, believe it was wrong to meet the fervor in the streets by bringing the criminal charge. Far from cooling passions, these critics say, the Government has only encouraged militants in the fundamentalist Party of God, a hitherto marginal political force.\nBut in apportioning blame, many here do not stop at the clerics and their appeasers. Many of those whose futures seem most at risk from the fundamentalists -- the professional class of bankers and doctors, engineers and editors who are working for a modernized, secular Bangladesh -- reserve much of their frustration for the Western countries that have intervened on Ms. Nasrin's behalf. They are irritated at what they regard as a short-sighted approach. In \"mistaking Bangladesh for Iran,\" as one scholar put it, the West may foster the extremism it seeks to oppose by leaving Bangladeshis feeling willfully misunderstood.\nResenting Labels\nBangladeshis have long complained at the stereotyping of their country. They resent Henry A. Kissinger's reference to Bangladesh as \"a basket case,\" a description that has seemed increasingly unjust in light of the country's success in raising food production, combating natural disasters, and lowering what had been one of the world's highest birth rates. And in the Nasrin affair, Bangladesh finds itself being disparaged anew as a country that is pandering to Muslim fundamentalism, and, in doing so, abandoning principles like freedom of expression that it espouses in its Constitution.\nA point made by many here is the one suggested by the uninhibited rejoicing over Brazil's victory in the World Cup -- that Bengali Muslims are in fact an easygoing and in many ways worldly people. Despite political upheavals that have included the tumultuous independence struggle with Pakistan in 1971, Bangladeshis say, their country is not a natural breeding ground for extremism. Religious zealots, they say, have always been a marginal force, all the more so since the Party of God, the fundamentalists' main political vehicle, took the side of the Pakistani army in 1971, and encouraged its followers to engage in savage bloodletting.\nWariness of Zealots\nBut if extremism is alien to many Bangladeshis, many here say, it would be unwise to ignore the potential that all religious zealots have for exploiting frustrations bred by chronic poverty and misunderstandings. The case most often cited is that of India, whose history since independence has been scarred by upheavals that have grown out of religious and cultural enmities. Although many here feel the Government erred in bringing a criminal charge against Ms. Nasrin, a wariness of the fundamentalists' wrath is shared even by the writer's supporters. \"Once fundamentalism is out of the bottle, you can't put it back,\" said Kamal Hossain, a former Foreign Minister who leads Ms. Nasrin's legal team.\nOthers here say that Western countries have made the mistake of speaking of freedom of expression as if Dhaka were London or New York, a place where democracy is sufficiently well rooted to survive the shocks of unfettered speech and writing.\nIn Ms. Nasrin's case, many writers and academics here say, the jarring point has been less her general case -- that traditional interpretations of the Koran have been used to inhibit the emancipation of women -- than the provocative methods she has chosen, particularly the sexually graphic language she has used in poems and newspaper columns. \"To most Bangladeshis, Taslima is like someone from Mars,\" an American diplomat said. \"There is simply no resonance for that kind of thing here.\"\nWith fundamentalist leaders drawing tens of thousands to their rallies against Ms. Nasrin, few here doubt that the threats to the writer must be taken seriously. But many educated Bangladeshis also fear that the affair may be used in the West to promote broader anxieties about the Muslim world. When Westerners condemn Bangladesh out of hand for its handling of the affair, without showing understanding of how explosive religious feelings can be in a largely illiterate country, these people say, they are promoting a new stereotype, of Muslim fundamentalism stalking its way across the Middle East and Asia. They are saying, in effect, that even if the Government was wrong-headed in trying to appease the fundamentalists by prosecuting Ms. Nasrin, it is just as wrong for Westerners to ignore the Government's need to outmaneuver the fundamentalists.\n\"The Taslima phenomenon has re-awakened the Western sense of Islam as an archaic, obscurantist force that favors the cutting off of hands and placing women in purdah,\" said Mahfuz Anam, a self-styled \"secularist\" who gave up a senior United Nations job in New York to become editor of The Daily Star, one of Dhaka's leading newspapers. \"When I see how the West is reacting to this business, I can't help feeling that there is an overwhelming urge there to say, 'Look! That's what Islam does!' instead of trying to understand how complex these things can be.\""}, {"text": "For Aid to Work, Help the Poor Help Themselves\n1994-03-16T05:00:00.000Z\nTwenty years ago, officials from around the world gathered in Rome to consider the plight of hungry masses everywhere. A commitment was made to eliminate global malnutrition by 1980. This was to be accomplished by creating new institutions, redesigning old ones and spending more money.\nProjects financed under this program were supposed to make adequate food available to millions of \"beneficiaries.\" Unfortunately, no such thing happened. But today there is an opportunity finally to end hunger, by early in the next century, using the institutions that were supposed to have done so in 1980.\nWhen we think of aid \"beneficiaries,\" we think of faceless people in distant countries. The word \"donors\" brings to mind sluggish bureaucracies of various shapes and sizes. Consultants, too, play a role; but they have little opportunity to meet those receiving aid. Their knowledge comes mostly from studies by academics, usually far removed from areas of need.\nThis process hardly allows for meaningful partnerships between donors and the poor.\nWho are the real \"beneficiaries\" of the international aid business, which distributes about $60 billion a year? A study in Bangladesh found that 75 percent of the billions of dollars Bangladesh has received in foreign aid since independence in 1971 went back to donor countries to pay for consultants, advisers, commodities, equipment and so on. Most of the remaining 25 percent of the aid went to local consultants, advisers, contractors, bureaucrats and engineers, not the poor. So who are the real beneficiaries?\nThe aid to Bangladesh helped build roads, bridges, power plants and research institutions, and helped buy equipment for factories.\nLarge numbers of people are supposed to benefit. But most often, it is the people who prepare and implement \"aid projects\" who benefit.\nThe poorest half of the populations of recipient countries, particularly women, see few benefits. Some projects even harm them.\nAid bureaucracies claim to promote \"development\" in Third World countries. Development, in most cases, is interpreted as short-term economic growth. Aid methodologies are usually designed by so-called experts at growth-promotion. These experts may do a good job of building infrastructure, but they show no skill in improving the productive capacity of poor people.\nThe multilateral development finance institutions, both global and regional, focus on infrastructure building. Their methodologies allow them to work only with national governments, not nongovernmental organizations or civic groups.\nIt is time for the wealthy Northern countries to make a political commitment to build solidarity with the poorest half of the population in the South, particularly women. Tax-payers in donor countries should make it plain to their aid officials that they want their money to be spent directly on the reduction of poverty. There should be a clear timetable for making the world poverty-free.\nBut first, several important changes will be needed in the aid agencies; this is particularly true of the multilateral development finance institutions. All these agencies need to redefine their missions to reflect this new commitment.\nOne strategy that development agencies can use to make this happen is to ensure that the poor have access to investment capital. Credit is a potent weapon, helping the poor fight their way out of poverty through their own efforts. Poor women show exceptional skill and agility in building better lives for themselves and their families once they have access to credit.\nGrameen Bank in Bangladesh, and more than 100 Grameen programs in 40 other countries, have demonstrated this beyond doubt.\nToday, Grameen Bank serves nearly two million borrowers in Bangladesh, 94 percent of them women. Grameen works in half of Bangladesh's 68,000 villages.\nLast year more than $300 million was disbursed in housing and income-generating loans. The repayment rate remains above 98 percent. Research on Grameen borrowers shows that the bulk of them are moving steadily out of poverty.\nGrameen Bank has always been known as a bank for the poor. But we are approaching a time when it will be described as the bank of the formerly poor.\nWe find it strange that while Grameen is admired for pioneering a method that gives the poor a chance to move out of poverty, international development finance institutions find it impossible, or at least difficult, to support the Grameen replication programs around the world. Their rules, procedures, methodologies and concepts get in the way.\nIn frustration, we have created a separate organization, Grameen Trust. Private and official donors have provided funding to finance Grameen replications around the world. To cope with fast-rising demand for training and funding, the Trust has prepared an estimate of demand over the next five years. We are asking donors to help us assemble the needed amount - about $100 million - to support an increasing number of Grameen replications.\nIf the people of the donor countries make a political commitment to build solidarity with the poor around the world, they will know how to change their bilateral and multilateral aid machineries to carry out their will. No excuses from aid agencies can stand before the firm political commitment of concerned taxpayers.\n-\nThe writer is managing director of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh.

They try to kill me but I will never stop writing. They will kill my family but they will never stop my writing.\" The words are delivered softly, in a manner so understated it seems as if Taslima Nasrin is talking about someone else. \nIn the nearly three months since she went into hiding after the Bangladeshi Government charged her with defaming Islam, she has been attacked by fundamentalists and by her fellow feminists, who blame her for drawing the mullahs' wrath.\nIt is one of the ironies of her case that, despite her fervent demands for women's rights and her equally ardent Bangladeshi nationalism, she has been defined by her detractors, accused of being a pawn in the hands of those who seek to undermine not only Bangladesh but the course of women's rights there. Nine days ago, after fleeing to Sweden, Taslima Nasrin spoke for herself.\n\"The fundamentalists are destroying our society,\" she said. \"The silent majority is afraid of them. They will do anything in the name of God. The progressives are not so organized, they cannot bring together 300,000 people at one time.\"\nIt is clear why the mullahs have put a price on her head. She is three times married, she is an outspoken feminist, and she has written with contempt about the political motives and spiritual affectations of the Muslim clergy. \"The country is infected with them,\" she said. \"Their long hair, beards and robes conceal their insatiable lust for wealth and women.\"\nBut the Islamic fundamentalists are not the only enemies that Ms. Nasrin has made. Her own Government, led by Khaleda Zia, a woman prime minister, was unable or unwilling to stand by her. The more progressive leader of the opposition, Hasina Wazed, daughter of the assassinated \"father of the nation,\" Sheik Mujibur Rahman, has said Ms. Nasrin doesn't deserve to live in Bangladesh. Her fellow writers were nearly mute during the two months she spent as a fugitive from a Government arrest warrant for blasphemy. Even the feminists in Bangladesh turned on her, accusing her of becoming a patsy for the West.\nBut Ms. Nasrin, 32 years old and trained as a physician, is not a creation of the West. Though often cast as a champion of Western feminism, she arises out of local ingredients, writes about tensions dominating not only India and Bangladesh but also Calcutta and Dhaka, the major cities of what was once an undivided Bengal.\nThe 1905 division of East and West Bengal along religious lines -- the east being predominantly Muslim and the west Hindu -- prefigured the 1947 partition of the subcontinent, when East Bengal became East Pakistan. Even after ridding the country of the Pakistani military in 1971, Bangladesh remains an uncertain parliamentary democracy. It is not always clear in which direction its loyalties lie -- with West Bengal and its shared language and centuries-old literary tradition, with the West, whose aid organizations underwrite hundreds of development schemes in the countryside, or, as an oil-poor state, with the Gulf, Pakistan and some idea of an international Islam.\nThis quandary is at the heart of Ms. Nasrin's troubles, which began in 1991 when she received an important Bengali literary prize from Calcutta. The award of this prize to a writer from Bangladesh would normally have received front-page coverage in Dhaka's many newspapers. But the Calcutta editors' choice of a book by a 28-year-old woman with a reputation for writing popular books about sex was considered a calculated insult to the largely male Bangladeshi literary community. The story of the prize received a minor mention on the back page and the resentments simmered.Hindus and Muslims\n Ms. Nasrin's career was further complicated when her book \"Lajja\" (\"Shame\") was banned by the Government in 1993. This documentary novel concerned the plight of a Hindu family in Bangladesh following the demolition of a mosque by Hindu fundamentalists in India. In the violence that followed over 2,000 innocent Indian Muslims were killed. In Bangladesh, the majority Muslim community burned Hindu temples, shops and homes in retaliation.\nWhen the banned book was pirated in India by the Hindu fundamentalists, and sold on buses and trains as propaganda, there was further grist for resentment of Ms. Nasrin. Though she issued a press release declaring her hatred of all fundamentalists, Hindu or Muslim, the secular intellectuals and politicians were unappeased, and by the end of 1993 one mullah stepped forward with a $1,500 reward for her assassination, the first of several. When human rights organizations took up her cause, she was accused of painting Bangladesh as a hotbed of Islamic fundamentalism, even though the Islamic party has only 26 of the 330 seats in Parliament.\nMs. Nasrin is impatient with such criticisms. \"When I was writing columns and poetry in Dhaka the literary community embraced me,\" she said. \"When Calcutta took up my work I was accused of betraying Bangladesh,\" though, she said, every writer in Dhaka wants to be published by her Bengali publisher.\nAnd when the West took up Ms. Nasrin's work, Calcutta retaliated. This past spring, flush from her first trip abroad, she gave a provocative interview to an obviously hostile journalist for a Calcutta newspaper who then quoted her as saying that she believed the Koran should be \"thoroughly revised.\" Another journalist, present at the interview, denies Ms. Nasrin made such a statement. \nThe response was quick. A fundamentalist newspaper in Dhaka called for her arrest for violating a blasphemy clause left over from British rule. On June 4 the Government approved a warrant for her arrest.\nThat Ms. Nasrin is a woman, a loner, and an immensely successful writer partly explains her abandonment by the resentful literary community (though the writers Shamsur Rahman and Sofia Kamal are prominent absences on the list of her detractors). The same can be said of her relationship with local women's organizations. Ms. Nasrin recalls being approached by a prominent Dhaka feminist only to be asked who was she to be writing on women's issues. \"She said to me, 'I have been working with the women of Bangladesh for 25 years and no one knows my name, just Taslima Nasrin's.' \" Many Bangladeshi feminists are particularly discomfited by her writings on sexuality, feeling that there are more important priorities and that by writing about such intimate matters Ms. Nasrin exposes women to male titillation and betrays them.\n\"Other women write love stories, I write about sexual oppression,\" she says. And she writes about sex as she sees fit. \"I have no shyness describing anything about a woman's body or a man's body because I am a doctor. [The feminists] have decided that women should not talk about sex, that it is a man's place.\"Waking Women Up\n As a doctor for a Government family planning office in Mymensingh, Ms. Nasrin had ample experience of the sordid conditions of the women's lives she writes about. Still, she has often been taken to task for being contemptuous of women's activists, calling them, on occasion, \"housewives.\" She insists now that she respects them. \"My way is writing, their way is working in the villages. I think their ideology is to work slowly and keep silent and my thinking is different. Our goal is the same. To wake women up.\"\nYet it is precisely this silent work that some feel Ms. Nasrin has endangered. According to one local journalist, \"There has been a quiet revolution in the countryside. Village women have become politically conscious and are beginning to assert themselves. The process was going on silently and suddenly Taslima Nasrin wrote about it and the fundamentalist opposition formed around her.\" Recently, the mullahs have called for ridding Bangladesh of Western-funded non-Governmental organizations. In the countryside, local clerics have issued fatwas against families who don't send their children to the mullah's schools, against women who leave their homes to go to work, or who bring their children to local health clinics.\nThe threat to the mullahs is real. \"The money that is in education is in education for women,\" said a leader of a major aid organization, who requested anonymity. \"The World Bank is focusing heavily on adolescent girls. The women's organizations have been making real progress on population control and these programs now reach one-third of the country. In the past the social structures were dependent on traditional values but now the whole concept of purdah, of dowries, is breaking down.\"\nPerhaps Ms. Nasrin herself is partly the daughter of this silent revolution, begun in 1985 with the United Nations Decade of the Woman. Yet in Stockholm, despite her repeated references to \"the civilized world,\" Ms. Nasrin seemed disgusted by the West's food, wearied by the effort of speaking English and, at times, quite alone. She was reluctant to comment on the lives of Western women. She was unwilling or unready, too, to consider why she, alone of all the world's writers in prison, in hiding from their governments, in fear of their lives, had been rescued by the West. It is hard to imagine, however, that she will not continue to challenge those who would write her story for her."}, {"text": "U.N.

ON CAPTIVES\n1994-12-07T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Bosnian Serbs stepped up their humiliation of United Nations personnel today, promising to release an officer who was suffering from a heart ailment, only to renege and take two more soldiers captive.\nFour days after the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, promised to release all detained United Nations personnel, 349 are still being held. These do not include the 1,200-member Bangladeshi battalion trapped inside the besieged Bihac pocket in northwest Bosnia.\nThe incident today occurred at Banja Luka, the largest town in Serbian-held Bosnian territory, where three United Nations officers -- a Jordanian, a Bangladeshi and a Czech -- have been held by the Serbs for more than two weeks. At one point, the three were forced to park their vehicles for eight hours on the runways of two airfields as \"human shields\" against any NATO air strike.\nUnited Nations officials in New York identified the Jordanian officer as Maj. Ziad Hussein, 39, who is suffering from a serious heart condition. Under an agreement reached with the Serbs, a United Nations officer from Spain was supposed to replace him as a hostage today.\nPaul Risley, a United Nations spokesman at the military forces headquarters in Zagreb, said it was the Serbs themselves who suggested that the United Nations send in a substitute hostage for the Jordanian officer.\n\"Yesterday afternoon we reluctantly agreed to their atrocious offer,\" he said.\nBut when the Spaniard and a Czech officer arrived at Banja Luka today, they, too, were detained, bringing the number of captives to five.\n\"We protest this blatant, inhumane act of persecuting and denying medical treatment to an unarmed military observer,\" said Michael Williams, the chief United Nations spokesman here.\nA letter of protest from the top United Nations official here, Yasushi Akashi, brought a negative response from Lieut. Gen. Milan Gvero, the deputy chief of staff of the Bosnian Serb forces, who said the matter was in the hands of a local commander in Banja Luka.\nLast Friday, a United Nations soldier from Bangladesh, trapped in the Bihac area, died from a bronchial asthma attack apparently brought on by a combination of stress and cold. The Bangladeshi troops now have only enough fuel to heat their headquarters for four hours a day, United Nations officials said.\nThe Bangladeshis, who arrived to replace a French battalion just before the battle of Bihac began, entered the area ahead of much of their equipment. They are short of boots, food, blankets and even weapons, with only one rifle for every three men.\nThe idea of relieving their plight with parachute drops has been discounted by United Nations commanders because the Serbian forces in Bosnia and Croatia have surface-to-air missile batteries ringing the Bihac area, which had been one of the areas designated as a \"safe haven\" by the United Nations.\nNATO did consider striking these SAM-6 missile systems two weeks ago, but the threat of using force to counter the Serbian siege of Bihac has evaporated since the United States changed policy and aligned itself more closely with the Europeans, who prefer a diplomatic approach to military action.\nOne United Nations official said today that if the French battalion, and not the Bangladeshi, was still in the Bihac area, \"the political pressure for decisive action would be overwhelming by now.\"\nAt the peak, about 500 members of the United Nations force were being detained by the Bosnian Serbs, most of them in their own quarters.\nAsked recently about the detained United Nations personnel, Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose, the British commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia, said:\n\"Things don't always turn out the way we hoped. We just have to be patient and hope we can get them out. You can't make a comparison between a building where you have terrorists keeping people hostage and the situation we have here.\"\nAs the former commander of the British Army's Special Air Service, an unconventional-warfare unit whose motto is \"Who dares, wins,\" General Rose led the storming of the Iranian Embassy in London in 1980 to release hostages held there. But as commander of the 23,000-strong United Nations forces in Bosnia, his outlook has changed.\nGeneral Rose is now pressing for the release of all United Nations personnel, the reopening of Sarajevo airport and freedom of movement for United Nations convoys.\nEven though the Serbs have released some people and did allow one convoy to reach the eastern Muslim enclave of Srebrenica today, they have refused to cooperate with the United Nations until they receive guarantees that there will be no more NATO air strikes."}, {"text": "Damn Liberals\n1994-10-16T05:00:00.000Z\nALL THE TROUBLE IN THE WORLDThe Lighter Side of Overpopulation,Famine, Ecological Disaster, Ethnic Hatred,Plague, and Poverty.By P. J. O'Rourke.340 pp. New York:The Atlantic Monthly Press. $22.\nDO you hate modern life? Do you wallow in nostalgic dreams about returning to some golden past era of clean air and bucolic simplicity? If so, P. J. O'Rourke recommends that you say one word: dentistry.\nFed up with fashionable fretting, the baleful court jester of American conservatism traveled to the world's steaming, teeming places and studied the six horsemen of the politically correct apocalypse -- overpopulation, famine, ecological disaster, ethnic hatred, plague and poverty -- to prove that big problems are caused by big government, not by people or industry, and that politicians only make matters worse.\nMr. O'Rourke is the only writer in the world who can make foreign trade funny. His best story in \"All the Trouble in the World\" concerns the jute problem in Bangladesh, which he learned about while he was stuck in a tricycle-rickshaw traffic jam in Dhaka with an interpreter whose Anglo-Indian bureaucratese \"sounded like Gunga Din imitating Ira Magaziner.\"\nJute is a fiber plant native to Bangladesh. The source of burlap, jute was in great demand back when Bangladesh was Bengal and, as Mr. O'Rourke notes, the world used burlap for everything from sacks and rope to tents and paintbrushes. Synthetic fibers have made the usefulness of jute a thing of the past, but Bangladesh keeps growing it anyway because foreign aid ($1.5 billion annually) enables the central planners who run the Government to subsidize jute farmers.\nThere is even a Minister of Jute, who proudly showed Mr. O'Rourke his jute carpet and his lumpy jute business card and predicted that jute would soon be selling like hot cakes, because natural fibers are currently very fashionable in environmentalist circles. Unfortunately, jute draws moisture, and the Minister's carpet was coming apart under Mr. O'Rourke's feet. Subsidizing jute makes about as much sense as subsidizing meat-flavored ice cream, he concluded, yet the Bangladesh Government in its tunnel vision persists in using its own development capital to drain its own economy to produce something that the world no longer wants to buy.\nMr. O'Rourke, whose previous books include \"Parliament of Whores\" and \"Give War a Chance,\" has a knack for discovering little-known, absurd facts -- for example, that the \"Mork and Mindy\" fashions you see worn by the teeming masses on CNN are our fault. \"The old clothes that you give to charity are sold in bulk to dealers and wind up mostly in Africa,\" he writes. \"If you want to do something for the dignity of the people in sub-Saharan countries, you can quit donating bell-bottom pants to Goodwill.\"\nA stranger to equivocation, he accuses Time magazine of \"scaring the Lean Cuisine out of its ofay readers\" with stories about overpopulation in the third world. \"Fretting about overpopulation is a perfectly guilt-free -- indeed, sanctimonious -- way for 'progressives' to be racists,\" he says, and he speculates that bleeding hearts subconsciously think starving children are cute: \"Steven Spielberg's E.T. owes a lot to the Biafran-Bangladeshi-Ethiopian model of adorable suffering.\"\nEn route to the Peruvian Amazon, he turns his gimlet eye on some American \"eco-tourists\": \"They are in their 30's or 40's but sit on the airport floor cross-legged as though they were 15. They touch each other a lot and make prolonged eye contact, and their conversations are filled with little noises of affirmation.\"\nIn a devastating historical overview he traces the origins of environmentalism to Theocritus, the city boy who invented the pastoral ode in the third century B.C. He follows this thread down the centuries to Jean-Jacques Rousseau and thence to Thomas Malthus (\"the father of modern worrying\") and finally pulls it tight around the neck of Al Gore, whom he calls \"a fascist twinkie and intellectual dolt\" with \"repulsive totalitarian inclinations and the brains of a King Charles spaniel.\"\nThere is simply nothing left of Vice President Gore's \"Earth in the Balance\" after Mr. O'Rourke puts it through his logical-fallacy machine. Holding forth on petitio principii (begging the question), he reveals a large erudition under his carefully cultivated frat-rat persona, but like most conservative intellectuals, he hates intellectuals, blaming them for much of the trouble in Bosnia. \"Yugoslavia, like the rest of Eastern Europe, has more artists, writers and teachers than it has art, literature or schools,\" he writes. \"In the resultant mental unemployment, idealism flourishes.\"\nWhen he revisits his alma mater, Miami University in Ohio, we have only to read \"I arrived on campus during 'Hunger and Homelessness Week' \" to know what's coming. Listening to arguments about racism, he detected \"a recently invented little noise, something between tsk-tsk-tsk and hissing. It's the noise the kind of people who own more than one cat make when the kind of people who own more than one gun light cigarettes indoors.\"\nDoes P. J. O'Rourke fret about anything?

Mr. Rushdie, who has been in hiding since being sentenced to death by Iranian religious leaders in 1989, is organizing an international protest on Ms. Nasrin's behalf by other prominent writers.\nI am sure you have become tired of being called \"the female Salman Rushdie\" -- what a bizarre and comical creature that would be! -- when all along you thought you were the female Taslima Nasrin. I am sorry my name has been hung around your neck, but please know that there are many people in many countries working to make sure that such sloganizing does not obscure your identity, the unique features of your situation and the importance of fighting to defend you and your rights against those who would cheerfully see you dead.\nIn reality it is our adversaries who seem to have things in common, who seem to believe in divine sanction for lynching and terrorism. So instead of turning you into a female me, the headline writers should be describing your opponents as \"the Bangladeshi Iranians.\" How sad it must be to believe in a God of blood! What an Islam they have made, these apostles of death, and how important it is to have the courage to dissent from it!\nGreat writers have agreed to lend their weight to the campaign on your behalf: Czeslaw Milosz, Mario Vargas Llosa, Milan Kundera and more. When such campaigns were run on my behalf, I found them immensely cheering, and I know that they helped shape public opinion and government attitudes in many countries.\nYou have spoken out about the oppression of women under Islam, and what you said needed saying. In the West, there are too many eloquent apologists working to convince people of the fiction that women are not discriminated against in Muslim countries or that, if they are, it has nothing to do with the religion. The sexual mutilation of women, according to this argument, has no basis in Islam. This may be true in theory, but in many countries where this goes on, the mullahs wholeheartedly support it. And then there are the countless crimes of violence within the home, the inequalities of legal systems that value women's evidence below that of men, the driving of women out of the workplace in all countries where Islamists have come to, or even near to power.\nYou have spoken out about the attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh after the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque in India by Hindu extremists. Yet any fair-minded person would agree that a religious attack by Muslims on innocent Hindus is as bad as an attack by Hindus on innocent Muslims. Such simple fairness is the target of the bigots' rage, and it is that fairness which, in defending you, we seek to defend.\nYou are accused of having said that the Koran should be revised (though you have said that you were referring only to Islamic religious code). You may have seen that only last week the Turkish authorities have announced a project to revise these codes, so in that regard at least you are not alone. And even if you did say that the Koran should be revised to remove its ambiguities about the rights of women, and even if every Muslim man in the world were to disagree with you, it would remain a perfectly legitimate opinion, and no society which wishes to jail or hang you for expressing it can call itself free.\nSimplicity is what fundamentalists always say they are after, but in fact they are obscurantists in all things. What is simple is to agree that if one may say \"God exists\" then another may also say \"God does not exist\"; that if one may say \"I loathe this book\" then another may also say \"But I like it very much.\" What is not at all simple is to be asked to believe that there is only one truth, one way of expressing that truth, and one punishment (death) for those who say this isn't so.\nAs you know, Taslima, Bengali culture -- and I mean the culture of Bangladesh as well as Indian Bengal -- has always prided itself on its openness, its freedom to think and argue, its lack of bigotry. It is a disgrace that your Government has chosen to side with the religious extremists against their own history, their own civilization, their own values. It is the treasure-house of the intelligence, the imagination and the word that your opponents are trying to loot.\nI have seen and heard reports that you are all sorts of dreadful things -- a difficult woman, an advocate (horror of horrors) of free love. Let me assure you that those of us who are working on your behalf are well aware that character assassination is normal in such situations, and must be discounted. And simplicity again has something valuable to say on this issue: even difficult advocates of free love must be allowed to stay alive, otherwise we would be left only with those who believe that love is something for which there must be a price -- perhaps a terrible price -- to pay.\nTaslima, I know that there must be a storm inside you now. One minute you will feel weak and helpless, another strong and defiant. Now you will feel betrayed and alone, and now you will have the sense of standing for many who are standing silently with you. Perhaps in your darkest moments you will feel you did something wrong -- that those demanding your death may have a point. This of all your goblins you must exorcise first. You have done nothing wrong. The wrong is committed by others against you. You have done nothing wrong, and I am sure that one day soon you will be free."}, {"text": "Serbs Release 55 Canadians But Renew Attack on Enclave\n1994-12-09T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Bosnian Serbs released 55 Canadian soldiers today among the 300 United Nations troops they have detained for more than two weeks. But the Serbs also pressed their attack on the Muslim enclave of Bihac, firing a surface-to-air missile into the area.\nThe release of the Canadians in an area northwest of Sarajevo came as the United States signaled its readiness to take part in a huge NATO operation to assist in a possible withdrawal of all 23,000 United Nations troops in Bosnia. Although such a withdrawal is not regarded as imminent, preparations for one increase the pressure on the warring parties to make peace.\nThe Muslim-led Bosnian Government forces, although strengthened in recent months, still need the United Nations as a buffer against the better-armed Serbs, particularly around the three encircled Muslim enclaves in eastern Bosnia. The Serbs, on the other hand, would not welcome an arrival of large numbers of NATO troops, even to assist in a United Nations withdrawal.\nUnited Nations officials gave few details on the release of the Canadians in the Ilijas area. More than 250 United Nations troops are still being detained by the Bosnian Serbs for what they regard as an insurance policy against further NATO air strikes.\nThere were no reports of mistreatment of the Canadians by the Serbs; but two Western photographers were handcuffed, hooded, and repeatedly beaten during two days of captivity north of Bihac this week.\nMichael Williams, a spokesman for the United Nations, protested the \"outrageous treatment\" of Ron Jacques, an American who works for the Saba photo agency, and Luc Delahaye, a French photographer for the Magnum agency. He said it appeared they had been beaten by a unit of Yugoslav Army soldiers from Belgrade after being arrested in Vojnic, a town in the Serb-held area of Croatia, on Monday.\nThe antiaircraft missile fired today by the Bosnian Serbs passed narrowly over the headquarters of a battalion of United Nations soldiers from Bangladesh that has been isolated in the Bihac area for weeks. The extent of damage was not immediately clear because the SAM-2 missile was fired at night, the United Nations said. The Serbs also allowed a United Nations convoy into the Bihac region today, carrying 16.5 tons of food and equipment for the 1,200 Bangladeshi soldiers trapped in the area.\nMissile attacks endangering United Nations soldiers might in the past have provoked an air strike from NATO planes in response. But the United States and its European allies appear for now to have abandoned force as a means to encourage a Bosnian settlement.\nThe missile fired today came from one of several batteries that have appeared around Bosnia and in the Serb-held region in Croatia over the past month. These missiles, which were either kept under wraps previously or were somehow smuggled into Serb-held territory in recent weeks, now threaten the airspace over about 45 percent of Bosnia, American officials said.\nAs a result, the airlift that brings more than 80 percent of the food aid to Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, has been halted for almost three weeks, and the United Nations headquarters there is running out of fuel.\nIt appears certain that the airlift will not resume until the Serbs remove at least one surface-to-air missile battery near Sarajevo.\nBut the Serbs have made clear they will not remove that system until they receive guarantees that NATO will conduct no more air strikes, western officials said. Thus Sarajevo is once again cut off, apart from a small track over Mount Igman that is exposed to Serbian fire, as winter approaches.\nAs the situation in Bosnia continued to deteriorate, officials from the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia -- the so-called \"contact group\" on the Balkans -- traveled to Sarajevo in a bid to revive a peace plan offering 51 percent of the country to a Muslim-Croat federation and 49 percent to the Serbs.\nOne of the officials said the plan, previously presented as a take-it-or-leave-it proposal, was now being offered in a more flexible form. He said the officials hoped to secure a statement from the Muslim-led Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs saying that they had both agreed to begin negotiations on the basis of the contact group plan.\nSuch an oral \"yes\" from both parties, even without a signature, would allow them to begin talking about mutually acceptable swaps of territory and constitutional arrangments for the Serbs.\nThe main swap being considered by mediators is a Bosnian surrender of the three eastern Muslim enclaves in exchange for more land in and around Sarajevo; the constitutional arrangement sought by the Bosnian Serbs is independence or confederation with Serbia.\nUnder pressure from internal opposition, and perhaps also from his military commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic, it appeared that the Bosnian Serb political leader, Radovan Karadzic, might be prepared to begin talks.\nGeneral Mladic has been called to Belgrade at least twice over the past week. The Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, who says he now favors a peaceful settlement in Bosnia, clearly has some sway over him.\nBut it is not certain that the Bosnian Government, which had accepted a plan that is now suddenly open for further discussion, would be ready to begin new negotiations."}, {"text": "Clinton Writes to Reassure Bosnian Government of Support\n1994-12-05T05:00:00.000Z\nSeeking to end recent uncertainty here over Washington's position on the Bosnian war, President Clinton in a letter today gave unequivocal support to Bosnia's Muslim-led Government and its territorial integrity.\n\"Let me be clear: the United States remains committed to the preservation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a single state within its existing borders,\" Mr. Clinton wrote to President Alija Izetbegovic.\nThe halls of Bosnia's Presidency building were thick with rumors last week that Washington had withdrawn support for the peace plan drafted by five countries known as the contact group. The plan would force the Bosnian Serbs to surrender a third of the Bosnian territory they hold and abandon the dream of a Greater Serbia.\nThree group members, Russia, Great Britain and France, have pressed for amending the plan to allow Serbia to form a federation with the nationalist Serbs. The United States and Germany have opposed amending the plan, which the Bosnian Government has accepted and the Bosnian Serbs have rejected.\n\"We do not favor a Bosnian Serb confederation with Serbia,\" Mr. Clinton wrote. \"Constitutional arrangements must be worked out by the parties on the basis of mutual consent in accordance with the contact group plan.\" The President called the conflict here a \"war of aggression.\"\nThe Serbs are clearly working to scuttle the peace plan. Today they pressed ahead with an offensive on the United Nations-designated safe area of Bihac in the northwest, apparently in an effort to press the Bosnian Government to agree to a cease-fire that would effectively cede to the Serbs the Bosnian lands they have overrun.\nThe Bosnian Serbs have halted the entire United Nations military and aid-delivery operation across the most vulnerable regions of Bosnia, as well as NATO flights to enforce a no-flight zone declared by the United Nations, by taking hostages, activating antiaircraft missiles at 30 sites, beating some United Nations troops, blocking overland food and fuel convoys and closing the Sarajevo airport, United Nations officials said.\nBosnian Serb forces freed two convoys of peacekeepers today, said a United Nations military force spokesman here, Lieut.

Jan-Dirk von Merveldt.\nThe Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, two days ago promised Yasushi Akashi, the top United Nations official in the former Yugoslavia, that the peacekeepers would be released, but did not say when.\n\"Every day there has been a sort of crumb tossed,\" Colonel von Merveldt said. \"Let's hope somebody hits the jackpot tomorrow.\"\nThe Serbs also allowed a United Nations military force convoy to enter the Bihac area with supplies for some 1,200 poorly armed Bangladeshi peacekeepers whose food and had nearly run out, United Nations officials said.\nThe hostages released today include 20 British and 33 Dutch soldiers whose convoys were allowed to travel into the eastern Bosnian enclaves of Gorazde and Srebrenica.\nThe Serbs seized the hostages as insurance against military action after NATO jets bombed an air base in a Serbian-held area of Croatia and three Bosnian Serb antiaircraft missile sites two weeks ago.\nBut the NATO air strikes have stopped, and the United States has said that for the time being it will not press for further military action.\nThe hostages who remain include 267 Russian, French and Ukrainian troops confined to weapons-collection depots around Sarajevo, 7 Ukrainian peacekeepers kidnapped from an observation post, 55 Canadian soldiers taken prisoner near Visoko and 27 military observers who were confined to their quarters on Serbian-held territory in Bosnia.\nUnited Nations officials insist that all the hostages have been well treated and are in communication with their commanding officers. Serbian officials have told United Nations military commanders that they will release the hostages only when NATO gives the Serbs details about NATO flights over Bosnia.\nOne Bangladeshi peacekeeper died in the Bihac enclave on Saturday, Colonel von Merveldt said. He said it was uncertain if the lack of food and fuel had caused his death.\nUnited Nations officials reported heavy front-line clashes tonight in the towns of Bihac and Velika Kladusa, including artillery and mortar detonations within the safe area, Colonel von Merveldt said.\nIn a statement to Sarajevo television, Ejup Ganic, vice president of the Bosnian-Croatian federation, all but ruled out any chance that the Bosnian Government would agree to a confederation between Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs.\nBosnia's Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic, said after reading Mr. Clinton's letter to a news conference: \"There is no change in the contact group's plan. There can be no change, because the contact group insisted on this plan being the last and definitive plan. It was a take-it-or-leave-it plan, so we took it.\"\nIn Belgrade today, the foreign ministers of Britain and France, Douglas Hurd and Alain Juppe, called on Serbia's President, Slobodan Milosevic, to work to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to accept the peace plan.\nDespite optimistic public statements by the Serbian President, a senior British official said after the meeting that Mr. Milosevic was \"disappointed\" with what the foreign ministers had to offer, adding that he was more interested in talking about a territorial swap."}, {"text": "Serb Pounding of Bihac Wounds 4 U.N. Peacekeepers\n1994-12-13T05:00:00.000Z\nNationalist Serb fighters mounted a mortar and rocket attack today on a heavily crowded neighborhood of Bihac, in northern Bosnia, and wounded four Bangladeshi peacekeepers with missiles that set fire to their armored vehicle, United Nations officials said.\nThe attacks amounted to a serious affront to the United Nations in Bihac, where nationalist Serbs have ignored Security Council resolutions declaring it a \"safe area.\"\nUnited Nations commanders did not make contact with NATO on the possibility of staging air strikes to protect the civilians in Bihac, a military spokesman said.\nThe Serbs are also enforcing a ban on armored vehicles crossing their territory and a blockade of fuel shipments, forcing the United Nations to curtail operations in Sarajevo, Bihac and three Muslim enclaves in eastern Bosnia, all of which are surrounded by hostile Serbs.\nUnited Nations aid officials said they would try to bring food convoys into Sarajevo on Tuesday without a military escort, putting United Nations commanders in the difficult position of deciding whether to obey the Serbs' ban on armored vehicles.\nThe Serbs allowed one United Nations food convoy to be escorted by armored vehicles today, but it was bound for the Serbs in Rajlovac, a Sarajevo suburb, a United Nations official said. Rebel Serb gunmen have hijacked or plundered at least four United Nations aid and fuel convoys in another suburb, Ilidza, in the last month.\nIf effective, the Serbs' ban on armored vehicle escorts for food convoys would cut away the centerpiece of the peacekeepers' mandate. The assault on Bihac made a virtual dead letter of the other major element of the mandate, to protect \"safe areas.\"\nIn the attack today, United Nations officials said, an air-to-ground missile did not explode when it hit Bihac town. The officials said that the Serbs could have fired the rocket from a jerry-built ground launcher, but that it had probably been fired from the air and in all likelihood from a helicopter.\n\"United Nations military observers are presently attempting to determine the origins of the missile,\" said Paul Risley, a spokesman at the United Nations military forces headquarters in Zagreb, Croatia.\nThe Serbs carried out two similar attacks on Bihac in October, using helicopters in violation of a NATO ban on military flights over Bosnia.\nTwo 82-millimeter mortar shells also hit Bihac today, critically wounding a teen-age boy, Mr. Risley said.\n\"The mortar rounds that landed on Bihac town two days ago as well as today are clear instances of direct targeting of civilian populated areas within the safe area,\" Mr. Risley said, adding that NATO had not been approached about air strikes to protect the \"safe area.\"\nThe commander of the United Nations military force in Bosnia, Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose, was informed of the attack on the Bangladeshis as he was meeting this afternoon with nationalist Serb leaders to ask the Serbs to allow the peacekeepers to resume normal operations.\nUnited Nations commanders have all but ruled out the possibility of calling on NATO for air strikes because the Serbs have positioned surface-to-air missile sites all around the area, United Nations officials said.\n\"We have an inability to carry out close air support or protect the safe area,\" a United Nations official said, adding that NATO has not conducted flights over the area in 10 days. \"There is an increased fear, an increased threat of these missile systems, as well as an increased unwillingness of the United Nations military force commanders to allow NATO to hold unquestioned control of the air space over Bosnia.\""}, {"text": "Serbs Step Up Bombardment of Besieged Muslim Enclave\n1994-12-06T05:00:00.000Z\nNationalist Serb rebels bombarded Government-controlled areas in northwestern Bosnia today with incendiary shells, setting off fires in Velika Kladusa, a United Nations spokesman said.\n\"We have eyewitness accounts from the Croatian side of the border that speak of incendiary shells,\" said Paul Risley, a spokesman for the United Nations in Zagreb, Croatia. \"This would indicate a great escalation in the fighting.\"\nShellfire and gun battles also erupted today inside the United Nations \"safe area\" of Bihac, where Bosnian Serb forces appeared to be maneuvering for position to mount an infantry assault against Bihac town, United Nations officials said.\nOnly 500 Bosnian Army troops are defending the 70,000 people trapped in the Bihac area, while the attacking nationalist Serb forces number about 2,000, a United Nations official said. \"The Bosnians in Velika Kladusa are putting up stiff resistance,\" the official said. \"Our assessments predicted that the town would fall two weeks ago.\"\nIgnoring United Nations resolutions, an international border and countless warnings, nationalist Serbs have counterattacked Bihac in force, apparently trying to force the Government to accept a halt of hostilities. A cease-fire would give the Serbs final control of the 70 percent of Bosnia that they hold after a 32-month campaign that has included forcing thousands of Muslims and Croats from their homes at gunpoint. During their offensive, the Serbs have taken hundreds of United Nations peacekeepers hostage, and blockaded food and fuel convoys.\nIn some of the frankest language ever by a United Nations spokesman here, Thant Myint-U said this morning that the Serbs were in effect waging war against the peacekeeping force, known as Unprofor.\n\"The international community should understand clearly that the Bosnian Serbs are not only waging war against the Bosnian Government in Bihac,\" he said. \"They are targeting Unprofor, detaining its personnel and denying others essential supplies. This is a deliberately designed, carefully calculated insult against the United Nations.\"\nThis morning's release of seven Ukrainian peacekeepers leaves the Serbs holding 349 United Nations troops and military observers, United Nations officials said.\nMr. Risley, the United Nations spokesman in Zagreb, also said today that the Serbs' refusal to allow the United Nations to resupply 1,200 poorly equipped Bangladeshi soldiers in Bihac caused the death of one peacekeeper who had an asthma attack on Saturday.\n\"That Bangladeshi soldier died because the Serbs refused to allow medical equipment to be sent in that would have been standard equipment for a battalion,\" he said."}, {"text": "SERBIAN BLOCKADE HINDERING THE U.N.\n1994-12-11T05:00:00.000Z\nA fuel shortage resulting from blockades by nationalist Serbs has virtually paralyzed United Nations military and aid operations in the most vulnerable areas of this war-torn country, United Nations officials said today.\nAlthough the Bosnian Serbs have sporadically permitted food to enter some encircled Muslim enclaves in recent days, they are barring trucks carrying aviation or diesel fuel, said a spokesman for the United Nations peacekeeping force here, Lieut. Col. Jan-Dirk von Merveldt.\n\"It's a fuel embargo,\" he said. \"We regard such restrictions on fuel convoys as a direct attack on the United Nations troops and on those people for whom we are responsible -- the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina -- as surely as if it were a military action.\"\nBut in a move that brought United Nations peacekeepers some hope, nationalist Serbs today freed 187 French, Russian and Ukrainian troops who had effectively been held hostage around Sarajevo, United Nations officials said. The men had been detained for two weeks at weapons-collection points as insurance against NATO air strikes.\nThe Serbs allowed the United Nations to send in 187 peacekeepers to replace them and promised that they would be able to move freely, a United Nations spokesman said. But officials said it was unclear whether the replacements would be allowed to carry out their duties fully.\nThe Serbs began strangling the United Nations operation in Bosnia late last month after NATO carried out retaliatory air strikes against Serbian positions used to attack the northwestern Muslim town of Bihac. At one time the Serbs were detaining more than 450 United Nations personnel in Bosnia to forestall further NATO air strikes. With the release today, nearly all those troops have now been freed or replaced.\nBut in another challenge, rebel Serbs in Croatia refused to let the commander of the United Nations force in Bosnia travel through their territory to visit some 1,200 Bangladeshi peacekeepers trapped in the Bihac pocket. The commander, Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose, turned back to Zagreb, the Croatian capital, where he had begun his journey.\nGeneral Rose had been hoping to lift the morale of the Bangladeshi troops and to seek ways of getting more supplies to them.\nSerbs control 70 percent of Bosnia and a wide swath of Croatia.\nTheir fuel blockade has reached a critical stage in Sarajevo, in Bihac and in Zepa and Gorazde, two of the three Muslim enclaves in eastern Bosnia that have not yet been overrun by Serbs. All are designated by the United Nations as safe areas and guarded by United Nations troops.\nInside the siege lines of Gorazde, British peacekeepers have come under Serbian fire at least twice this week while carrying out their patrols on foot, a United Nations report from the town said. The troops have been moving about on foot and transporting supplies by mule instead of using armored vehicles so they can conserve fuel, the report said.\n\"Fuel for the generators is being siphoned from vehicle tanks, which is the only fuel remaining,\" said the report, which was dated Tuesday.\nColonel von Merveldt said that food deliveries to tens of thousands of people in Zepa and Gorazde might even be canceled because the United Nations force lacked enough fuel to do what remains its top duty in Bosnia: providing military escorts to truck convoys. The fuel cutoff also hampers United Nations military communications.\nUnited Nations officials here had been optimistic that nationalist Serb leaders would allow the military force to return to more normal operations after the Serbs began freeing some hostages last week.\nThey noted that the Serbs also let a food convoy reach the eastern town of Srebrenica on Tuesday for the first time in six months. And a food convoy arrived on Friday in Bihac for the first time in nine weeks.\nTwo food convoys were also admitted today to Sarajevo, the first shipments to arrive since mid-November. The United Nations shut down its relief airlift to the city on Nov. 19 because the Serbs refused to guarantee the planes' safety. Nearly 80 percent of the Bosnian capital's food has been supplied by air since June 1992, two months into the war.\nOne convoy of fuel reached the Sarajevo airport by land today, but it was unclear if it would be allowed to cross Serb-held territory and enter the city itself, United Nations officials said.\nSarajevo has enough diesel to last one day and enough gas to last three days under normal working conditions, the officers said. In Bihac, United Nations troops have less than a day's supply of diesel fuel left, another report said.\nThe United Nations documents clearly indicate that the Serbs have hamstrung the United Nations mission as a warning to NATO, which has in any case suspended its flights over Bosnia so it can avoid clashes with the Serbs.\nUnited Nations commanders and NATO allies have responded to the deteriorating situation by threatening to withdraw all peacekeepers from the country."}, {"text": "Sports of The Times; The Games, The Splendor, The Horror\n1994-02-11T05:00:00.000Z\nFROM the mountain site of the Olympic Stadium, where the curved stands and the colorful flags are in order for the opening ceremony of the 1994 Winter Games tomorrow, one can gaze out on the town below.\nOn a cold, clear afternoon the scene is resplendent in Nordic beauty, in serenity, in peace. Everything is cloaked in the white of snow: all the houses, the shops, the cars and buses, and the people -- the people in their parkas, boots and funny snow hats going about their daily tasks.\nIt is difficult, if not nearly impossible, to imagine all this coming to a sudden and terrible stop. It is difficult to imagine many of those people lying dead or wounded, their blood staining the snow. It is difficult to imagine the blue and red and yellow houses with lace curtains and snow-capped roofs and chimneys -- looking small in the distance like sugar-topped gingerbread houses -- shattered by mortars and grenades and sniper fire.\nAnd it is difficult to imagine the screams and the tears, the Olympic venues turned into skeletal structures, and the Olympic Stadium itself a mass graveyard filled with hundreds and hundreds of tombstones.\n\"Ten years ago, nobody in Sarajevo could have imagined it either,\" said Svein Tornas, the campaign manager for and one of the originators of the Lillehammer Olympic Aid organization. \"But that is exactly what has happened to Sarajevo.\"\nTen years ago this week, the 1984 Winter Olympics began in Sarajevo with all the gaiety and promise of this one. Within a few years, war broke out.\nTornas has worked with missionary organizations in ravaged places like Cambodia and Bangladesh and Vietnam. From his home in Oslo, he watched on television the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville and the Summer Games in Barcelona.\n\"I felt there was no sense of any kind of the Olympic ideal, of caring about your fellow man, of remembering Sarajevo,\" said Tornas, sitting now in his small office here. He is 53, with gray hair and light-colored, earnest eyes. \"All I saw was people fighting for gold. It was all about commercialism. I went to the library and looked up what the Olympic ideals were supposed to be. In the Olympic Charter it states that aim of the Games is to 'educate young people in the spirit of understanding and friendship, thus contributing to building a better and more peaceful world.' All that had vanished.\"\nSince Norway was to hold the Games next, Tornas thought, \"maybe we can do something.\" He went to the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee and discovered that a few people there had been thinking along the same lines. Thus, the Lillehammer Olympic Aid group.\nStarting last May, there was a spirited nationwide campaign to collect donations, and the aid group, along with the Norwegian Red Cross and church groups, raised about $7 million. They used the money to buy and send 500 wood-burning stoves to Bosnia because there is no gas or electricity \"and people are freezing there,\" Tornas said. They sent food and medicine. And they helped build a clinic in the Kosevo Hospital, close by the cemetery that was once the Olympic Stadium.\nTornas had gained the aid of several top-flight Norwegian Olympians, including the cross-country skier Vegard Ulvang, a three-time gold medal winner in Albertville and a national hero. Ulvang, eager to help, went on a mission to Sarajevo in November, and wound up on the floor of the clinic as it was shelled.\nDr. Ragnal Stiel of Oslo agreed to operate the clinic. His specialty is spinal-cord injuries, of which there are now many, and the treatment of those who have been tortured, raped and have suffered other forms of violence.\n\"To me, it's ridiculous to hold another Olympics when such terrible things are going on,\" he said by telephone yesterday. \"But if the people in Sarajevo can be made to feel they have not been forgotten by the world, then maybe there is a reason for the Olympics, as a way to focus on the situation.\"\nThe aid group is also lending a hand in other war-torn areas -- Guatemala, Beirut, Afghanistan and Eritrea. Tornas plans for its torch to be handed to the Atlanta Olympic committee. For the next two weeks, there will be aid group collection boxes along Storgaten, the town's main street, and at most of the sports venues.\nMeanwhile, from the top of the mountain, Tornas had looked at the lovely Lillehammer scene. \"In 10 years' time, who knows what could happen,\" he said. \"Of course, people say it can't happen here. But it happened in Bosnia, in Beirut, in Northern Ireland. It can happen anywhere.\"\nIn about 48 hours, the Games would begin."}, {"text": "STRIFE IN RWANDA: PEACEKEEPERS; U.N. Forces Shelter Thousands In Rwanda\n1994-04-11T05:00:00.000Z\nThe 2,500 United Nations peacekeepers in Rwanda are providing shelter to thousands of Rwandans as the peace agreement the troops were sent to help enforce collapses, United Nations officials said today.\nJacques-Roger Booh-Booh of Cameroon, the United Nations mediator in Rwanda, reported by cable that the peacekeepers' camps in the capital, Kigali, and other parts of the country have taken in civilians \"terrified by the ruthless campaign of ethnic cleansing and terror.\"\nHe also said he had organized the talks between the Government and rebels seeking a cease-fire. 6,000 Taken In\nThe United Nations field hospital at Kigali, which has a staff of just 50 doctors, nurses and orderlies, had taken in almost 6,000 Rwandan civilians, Mr. Booh-Booh said. But the United Nations reported today that mortar bombs had struck the hospital during sporadic fighting in the capital, killing about 60 of the refugees and wounding another 100.\nA peacekeeping battalion from Bangladesh has given shelter to some 400 Rwandans in its compound, while 150 refugees are in the headquarters for the United Nations force, in the Kigali suburb of Remera. Officials said they did not know whether those being sheltered were from the majority Hutu tribe, which dominates the Government, or the minority Tutsis who lead the rebel party.\n\"Most units have minimal water and food, but attempts are made to share what little we have with the refugees,\" Mr. Booh-Booh said.\nThe United Nations says it is impossible to estimate the number of casualties, though these were described in Mr. Booh-Booh's cable as \"quite heavy and primarily ethnic in nature.\" Cease-fire Is Emphasized\nWhile emphasizing that the troops are doing what they can to help refugees, Mr. Booh-Booh said he believed the best assistance the United Nations can give Rwandans was to try to negotiate a cease-fire between the warring factions so that peace negotiations can continue.\nThe negotiations began on Aug. 4, 1993, when the United Nations -- with assistance from the Tanzanian Government and the Organization of African Unity -- persuaded the Government of President Juvenal Habyarimana to sign a peace agreement with the Tutsi-controlled opposition party, the Rwandan Patriotic Front.\nThis ended three years of sporadic fighting between the Government and the rebel forces, which control the north of the country and can retreat across the border to safe bases in Uganda.\nThe agreement provided that by last December 31, the opposition would join a new transitional Government that was to organize free elections within two years. President Habyarimana, whose death in a plane crash last week led to the current violence, was to remain in office until the elections. A Demilitarized Zone\nThe United Nations peacekeeping force patrols a demilitarized buffer zone about 100 miles long and up to 15 miles wide. It cuts through the north of the country, separating the rebel stronghold at Mulindi from the Government-controlled south.\nThe principal countries contributing troops to the peacekeeping force are Belgium, the former colonial power in Rwanda, Bangladesh and Ghana.\nThe United Nations force is also required to work with the local police to maintain security in Kigali and to protect opposition politicians who joined the transitional Government. Preventing Entry of Weapons\nThe peacekeepers' third task is to prevent either side from bringing more weapons into the country. It has sought to do this by establishing a monitoring force at Kigali airport and another 80-member observer team inside Uganda to watch cross- border trade.\nAs the force began to arrive late last year, France pulled out the battalion of troops it had sent in 1990 to help maintain order after an earlier outbreak of fighting. A small band of some 50 observers sent in later by the Organization of African Unity was incorporated into the United Nations force.\nWhile the military side of the United Nations effort had gone reasonably smoothly until last week, the political side has been an outright failure.\nThe country's leaders have still not agreed on the transitional Government that was supposed to take office at the start of this year. And earlier this month, an impatient Security Council turned down the Secretary General's request for a six-month extension of the peacekeepers' mandate and gave them only another only three months to put pressure on the politicians to stick to their agreement.\nBut as this month's Security Council president, Colin Keating of New Zealand, observed Saturday after the Council had reviewed the situation in Rwanda, the chances of the parties carrying out that peace plan in the near future \"seem slim at best.\""}, {"text": "MAKING IT WORK; The Labor of Waiting\n1994-12-18T05:00:00.000Z\nMOHAMMAD LITON was \"backwaiting\" a while ago at a big Manhattan restaurant, darting and cajoling in a Chaplinesque role in which he had to track all the food orders coming in from all the waiters and waitresses just beyond the swinging kitchen doors and bark assembly-line suggestions to the overwrought chef. The job is rather like that of a corner man in a prizefight who, surrounded by a throng of famished carnivores, must shout scraps of boxing science at a bloodied, reeling combatant.\nYet it is fondly that Mr. Liton, an adventurous soul in the spirit of Orwell's \"Down and Out in Paris and London,\" remembers the pure screaming in the kitchen on one particular lunch hour. Food orders from 51 different tables arrived at his backwaiting station within a frightening 24-minute span via slick-looking computer terminals that were absolutely no advantage in prodding the harried omelet maker to whisk faster, faster, and the sandwich man to smear and cut like a surgeon daft from triage.\n\"It is pure hustle, where you have to make people work and at the same time make them happy,\" the 25-year-old waiter summarizes with mixed pride and awe of the art of waiting on customers who, for the most part, don't have a clue about the raging emotional nature of it all. \"One minute you have to scream at the kitchen guy, and the next swing through the door with a big smile for the customers. You're in a business where you have to change your mood and not take it personal.\"\nNo wonder Mr. Liton serves up front these days in a smaller place, Ivy's Bistro in Greenwich Village, relaxed and friendly. He is five years gone from home in Bangladesh, where he was a son of the business class, and five years deep into the New York restaurant scene, where he savors the backstage screaming and center-stage currying.\n\"The customers cannot understand what we are really like unless they have waited on tables,\" Mr. Liton says flatly, baring the oft-hidden fact that a soul underlies each strafe of the pepper mill.\nNot surprising that his friend from the business, Maureen Meehan, regularly takes burnout breaks to tumble deeper into her first career, painting at an easel, in order to recover from waiting at table.\n\"I could have a Ph.D. in psychology at this point,\" says this hyperkinetic pixie after 14 years in the business at jobs ranging from busgirl to restaurant manager. \"As a waitress, you're basically walking up and confronting what a customer has been through all day. It could be something terrible at the job, the kids shooting drugs, the wife cheating. The skill is to read that and get the edge off them in a 20-minute span.\"\nIt's not that customers are monstrous, just human.\n\"Some people are like gold, but others dump whatever they want on you,\" says Ms. Meehan, a friendly, thoughtful person who has been spat upon in the waiting. \"Every different person needs a different way to be taken care of. One wants his drink ready. Another wants to talk with you.\"\nShe thinks the key to handling this and keeping the food and drink moving and the customers content as their hunger deepens, lies as much with who owns the restaurant and sets its tone as who eats and who serves.\n\"The worst place I worked is a coin toss between a complete psycho, a rich guy who saw his shrink five days a week and was such a miser that the waiters cheated him, and I couldn't do that and left,\" says Ms. Meehan, whose talk is breathlessly fleet to chef or interviewer, \"and a joint in the East Village where girls would shoot up in the bathroom and I'd have to carry them out. Give me an alcoholic any day.\"\nAnd the best job? \"That was Vix, which is closed now but was a hot new restaurant last summer that I managed on Broome Street. Things were wholesome, balanced, good. The food and people were like that. But you don't find enough people in the restaurant business who protect their conscience. They start out O.K., but the rent and overhead and customers get to them.\"\nAny menu nostalgia at the easel? \"Oh, I loved the restaurant business, the customers. I did,\" Ms. Meehan admits. \"I may have to go back to it next year when I'm broke again. There, you have to take care of everyone else's needs. Painting, I'm allowed to answer to Maureen.\"\nHer friend, Nana Olivas-McEwen, a waitress-become-barmaid on the West Side, is a painter who has learned to expect that abstract inspirations for her daytime works will arise from her nighttime job of slaking thirsts and slinging metaphysics at a place called The Cooler.\n\"All we want is love and recognition,\" said Ms. Olivas-McEwen, citing an observation from a conversation with a customer that serves her well as a comment on assorted facts of life and art and waiting. \"All We Want Is Love and Recognition\" was, as it turned out, the title of one of the paintings in her recent show at the Nuyorican Poets' Cafe in the East Village.\n\"Customers are very moody about food, very emotional,\" she has found. \"Very hungry when they come in and want their food fast if not immediately.\"\nAmong the least and most favorite humans she has ever met have been her customers, some of whom have cursed her as quick as inspired paintings. \"I take 'Good evening' or 'Hello' as a pretty good start of a warm relationship,\" she said. \"The most important thing is to never personalize. Everyone I know in the business has something else in life they love to do.\"\nMs. Olivas-McEwen relishes conversation with customers she has helped to relax. As for the others, the churls who might stiff her? \"One thing you keep in mind, they're always going to leave at some point.\"\nIt may be unrelated, but the night barmaid paints in blood by day -- cow's blood, not customers'. To unwind, she loves most being waited on well.\n\"My favorite restaurant is La Grenouille,\" she says. \"The best service ever. The owners come out and greet you. I eat lunch there and sit into the afternoon with friends, and they never hurry us, just offer another cognac.\"\nThere can be tears in waiting. \"Oh sure. Most of the time you're in a servile position, very powerless,\" she says. \"People can say or be wrong about something and there's nothing you can do about it.\"\nThen again, she was with friends who are restaurant workers out after the job at 4 A.M., and they were rude to the waitress. \"They were very bossy and just didn't realize it,\" she says of the fallibility that lies on both sides of the service equation. The service workerswere cranky from having hidden their emotions in the labor of waiting. 'Of Course I Tip Well'\nThe hired help tend to be Panglossian when they dine out and the table is turned with that inevitable question: \"Is everything all right?\"\nOf course I tip well,\" says Maureen Meehan, her heart on her sleeve as she forgives bad service from the incompetent or surly. Tips are often shared, or the chef's inebriated, she knows. Why punish the good help at other tables for the klutz at hers?\nMohammad Liton also demands something approacching assault and battery from a waiter before he begrudges the 20 percent. \"I do this thing myself,\" he says with surpassing empathy.\nAnd there but for the grace of Escoffier goes Nana Olivas-McEwen, is her view of bad waiting. \"When I have a nasty waiter, I'm very torn and don't know whether to say, 'Hey, cut it out,' or 'I know where you've been,' \" she says. \"I'm embarrassed most of all. Then I usually end up tipping the same 20 percent.\" FRANCIS X. CLINES"}, {"text": "Security Council Votes to Cut Rwanda Peacekeeping Force\n1994-04-22T05:00:00.000Z\nIn another retreat for the United Nations, the Security Council voted unanimously tonight to cut back the beleaguered peacekeeping force in Rwanda from some 1,700 at present to about 270, despite protests from human rights groups who fear that the move will only increase the carnage there.\nDiplomats here say that the decision came after the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, told the Council that the force should either be substantially strengthened so it can restore order or reduced to a symbolic size.\nMr. Boutros-Ghali rejected a third option of pulling it out altogether, which the United States had favored, saying the small force of 270 would be instructed to try to promote a cease-fire and assist with relief work. But in his report to the Council today, Mr. Boutros-Ghali appeared pessimistic about the prospects of an early end to the fighting in Rwanda. \"I regretfully have concluded there is no prospect of a cease-fire being agreed upon in the coming days,\" he said.\nDiplomats said there was no willingness to send another big peacekeeping force, like the one that had been sent to Somalia, to try to impose peace on Rwanda's warring tribes -- a task that the Secretary General said would require several thousand additional troops.\nMost of the existing force is being withdrawn for its own safety because the United Nations troops had originally been sent to oversee a peace agreement and not to become involved in a new civil war, these diplomats said.\nBut the 270 peacekeepers being left behind in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, will try to insure the safety of the roughly 20,000 Rwandans who have taken refuge with the United Nations. Human rights organizations and aid workers fear the refugees may be killed after the troops pull out.\nOn Wednesday, the commander of the United Nations force in Rwanda sent several hundred nonessential soldiers, mainly troops from Ghana and Bangladesh, out of the country for their safety. The move followed a decision by Belgium to evacuate the battalion it had contributed to the peacekeeping force after 10 of its soldiers were tortured and killed.\nAfrican and other third world members of the Security Council had favored greatly strengthening the Rwandan force instead and giving it a new mandate to put down violence and help with relief work. But it remained unclear whether any country would have risked sending more soldiers to Rwanda now.\nAs the Council was deciding to reduce the peacekeeping force, tribal killings continued in Rwanda, with the Red Cross reporting tens or even hundreds of thousands of people killed in fighting that has now spread all over the country. Peace Talks Are Planned\nThe President of Tanzania, Ali Hassan Mwinyi, said leaders of the Hutu-dominated Government and the Tutsi-controlled opposition would hold peace talks Saturday in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.\nBut it was unclear whether these talks have any realistic chance of producing a settlement.\nThe present United Nations peacekeeping force is charged with patrolling a demilitarized zone in the north of the country, separating the Government forces from those of the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front and helping to protect the coalition government that the two sidesare trying to form in Kigali.\nBut the United Nations has no mandate to go to war against the fighting bands who have reduced Kigali and much of the country to chaos. Moreover, after Belgium withdrew its battalion -- the only one trained and equipped to NATO standards -- the remaining forces from Ghana and Bangladesh were not considered up to the dangerous and sensitive mission of enforcing a return to law and order.\nHuman rights organizations fear that if the United Nations pulls out, tens of thousands of Rwandans living under its protection in the capital and at bases around the countryside will be slaughtered, adding to the already horrendous death toll. U.N. Protection Sought\nAn estimated 20,000 to 25,000 Rwandans, many of them from the Tutsi tribe, have sought protection at United Nations installations or at other areas under United Nations guard. \"The United Nations has a moral and legal obligation to maintain at a minimum the force that is in Rwanda, at least until those under its protection have been moved to safety,\" said Kenneth Roth of Human Rights Watch, based in New York.\n\"The symbolic force the Security Council may be about to authorize would be a thin veil over another massacre,\" Mr. Roth added.\nAccording to BBC reports from Kigali today, some 5,000 Rwandans under United Nations guard in the Amahoro soccer stadium in the capital are threatening to commit mass suicide if the troops protecting them are withdrawn.\nThe killing in Rwanda started after the country's President, Juvenal Habyarimana, and President Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi were killed on April 6 when a plane they were on crashed at Kigali airport under suspicious circumstances. The elite Hutu presidential guard went on a rampage, killing Tutsis and Hutu rivals and prompting a new offensive by the forces of the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front, whose troops have now invaded the capital.\nIn a cable received here today, the United Nations mediator in Kigali, Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh of Cameroon, reported that the Amahoro stadium was shelled again Wednesday, killing 11 refugees and wounding 40.\nHe reported that Kigali is increasingly short of food, drinking water and medical supplies and said that, with the streets littered with hundreds of dead bodies, the risk of epidemics is growing."}, {"text": "A Street Vendor's Harried Day\n1994-04-24T05:00:00.000Z\nIt was not quite noon when Gopal Saha, Mobile Food Vendor No. 18575, made his first sale of the day: a $2 Haagen-Dazs Cookie Dough Dynamo sandwich. \"Looking good,\" he said, stuffing the two already-crinkled bills deep in a blue jeans pocket. In another 20 or 30 minutes, the crowd swirling past his pushcart on West 49th Street in Rockefeller Center would swell to three or maybe even four abreast on the sidewalk. Potential customers all.\nSuddenly, Mr. Saha's worst nightmare began to come true. \"The alphas are coming,\" yelled the hot-dog vendor down the block. That is street-seller argot for the police, who have begun a crackdown on food carts in congested midtown neighborhoods the city has declared off limits.\nA blue-and-white police van whizzed down the block, stopping next to Mr. Saha's curbside emporium. Officer Henry Dopwell of the Peddler Task Force's summons enforcement unit hopped out and told Mr. Saha to hand his license to Officer Jose DeJesus, behind the wheel. 'Too Many Problems'\n\"Hard day,\" said Mr. Saha, 28, who was a rice- and vegetable-wholesaler in Bangladesh before he immigrated four years ago. \"Hard job. Too many problems. I pay taxes. I pay for a vendor's license. And then they close me down.\"\nNot quite. All the two officers did was to hand Mr. Saha a summons and tell him to move outside the no-vendor zone. But it was Mr. Saha's third summons of the week, meaning a fine of at least $100, up from the first-ticket minimum of $25. Officer Dopwell warned that if Mr. Saha did not get going, the police would confiscate his cart, presumably without letting him remove his merchandise, which would soon melt.\nThe Giuliani administration says the crackdown on food carts, which it began several weeks ago and which drew a protest of vendors last week, is part of a campaign on \"quality of life\" issues. Mr. Saha sees it the opposite way: food carts improve the quality of life in New York, he says. That was also the view of his first customer of the day, Doug Cangialosi, who fixes postage-meter machines and wanted a quick snack on his way to the next repair call.\n\"These guys are convenient,\" Mr. Cangialosi said. \"Let him make a living. He's not selling drugs or anything.\"\nThe crackdown has deepened Mr. Saha's fear of tickets. There are so many regulations he must follow that he says he cannot remember them all. Carts are restricted to sidewalks that are at least 12 feet wide. They can't block a crosswalk or a fire hydrant or be stationed across from a park. One vendor is supposed to be at least 20 feet from the next one. His Own Boss\nAnd there is more to Mr. Saha's workday than counting change and flashing a customer-is-always-right smile. He leaves his house in Astoria, Queens, about 9 A.M. to get to the commissary on West 47th Street in Manhattan where he stores his cart and gets his merchandise. At the end of the day, he takes the cart back. By the time he gets home at night, it's often after 9.\nLike many street-corner vendors, Mr. Saha is, in effect, his own boss. His season selling ice cream runs from April until fall. He rents his cart from the commissary owner, Clifford I. Stanton -- who usually has 15 to 20 carts out at the height of the season -- and then pays him to store it at night.\nHeeding the warning of the officers at 49th Street, Mr. Saha moved on -- no easy business. Lacking power steering, pushcarts are maneuvered with muscles and guile. If the driver's attention wanders, they can totter off the curb and land, wheels up, on the street, immobile as a beached whale.\nWhen he wasn't dodging potholes, Mr. Saha talked about his wife, Shipah. They were married four months ago, but she is still in Bangladesh. Mr. Saha said her emigration papers had been filed, but knowing that is small compensation for so great a separation. \"Every other month, I call her on the telephone,\" he said. \"One dollar per minute, maybe $1.20. Ten minutes, 15 minutes go very fast. A lot of income to talk.\"\nAnd on this day, at least, not much income was coming in. He sold two more Haagen-Dazs sandwiches after he got the summons, for a total of three by lunch hour. On a good day, he takes in about $200 and nets $60 to $70, about a third. Not today. \"Six dollars,\" he said at lunchtime. \"A profit of $1.50, maybe.\"\nHe sold off a bit more of his inventory in the afternoon, after moving to 47th Street and the Avenue of the Americas, a crowded corner where he was the latecomer among four carts.\nThe inventory would keep for one more day. \"After that,\" he said, \"it's no good.\" From Freezer to Cart\nHis merchandise is kept cold by three telephone-book-size blocks of dry ice. That morning, with the vapor rising, he had lugged each one from freezer to cart at Mr. Stanton's 47th Street commissary. Then he loaded in a dozen Haagen-Dazs cartons: tropical banana, cherry chocolate fudge, vanilla-and-almonds. He picked up 100 medium-size cups, 100 small and 50 large ones, along with two bucket-size containers of Frozade, a concoction of lemon or orange ice.\nIf the city disapproves of some aspects of the vendor's art, Mr. Stanton, at least, sings Mr. Saha's praises.\n\"The first key to success is being aggressive,\" he said. \"You're always going to be intimidated by someone out there: another vendor, the police, the store owner who doesn't want you on the block, the weather. You've got to be able to stand up to it. Gopal can. He can get himself around the corner to Radio City when a show is letting out, set up shop for five minutes, sell $100 worth of ice cream and move on.\"\nLike Mr. Stanton's other vendors, Mr. Saha has a well-organized routine, starting out eastward on 47th Street, turning onto 10th Avenue and then east again on 48th Street. \"In summertime, it's too hot to push,\" Mr. Saha said. \"I give a guy $10, but that's $10 from my family.\"\nHuffing past the Walter Kerr Theater, where \"Angels in America\" is playing, Mr. Saha maneuvered between a brown Chevrolet van and a blue Mercedes-Benz and confided that he had never been to a Broadway show. Nor has he tried to sell ice cream at a Broadway show. \"It's illegal to be here on the street at night,\" he said. Changing Times\nMr. Stanton, who is 30, says Mr. Saha's case illustrates how different today's street vending is from when they got into the business -- Mr. Saha just four years ago, Mr. Stanton 10 years ago as a college student needing a summer job. The ranks of vendors used to be filled out by students, out-of-work actors and bartenders looking to pick up some extra money during the day.\n\"That's all changed now,\" Mr. Stanton said. \"It's become difficult to get a Department of Health license. Three years ago, they started requiring a New York State tax certificate. The whole process takes two months. A college kid gets home in May; he cannot possibly do it. In Miami, I walked into the county office. Five minutes later, I had a sales tax number. That one thing alone could open doors to people who could really benefit.\"\nThis year, with all the uncertainty about the crackdown, Mr. Stanton imposed a freeze on taking on new vendors -- perhaps, he acknowledged, an unfortunate term in a business where the merchandise is supposed to be kept below 32 degrees. He said he had thought about selling out altogether.\n\"It's tough out there,\" he said. \"We have to scramble for what we had last week.\""}, {"text": "The Massacres in Rwanda: Hope Is Also a Victim\n1994-04-21T05:00:00.000Z\nTiny Rwanda has never been strategically significant in world politics. But for more than two decades this poor, overpopulated central African country has been a successful laboratory for foreign aid.\nIts small size, cooperative government, relative lack of corruption and excellent roads, telephone systems and electric utilities attracted hundreds of millions of dollars to test development projects and made the country largely dependent on international generosity.\nBut after two weeks in which tens of thousands of people have been massacred and thousands of Europeans and Americans have fled, much of Rwanda's gains have been threatened or lost. Even if stability is restored quickly, the hope of reclaiming the agricultural or industrial achievements in less than five years appears bleak.\nThe killing and the anarchy have now spread beyond Kigali, the capital, destroying the West's efforts to promote democracy and respect for human rights, the quid pro quo for aid in Africa in recent years. For the moment, several hundred million dollars of aid has been suspended. Without foreign aid workers, many programs have stopped.\nFaced first with the crisis caused by the hundreds of thousands of refugees, Rwanda must also replace an educated elite of Rwandans who have fled or have been killed. Short Term Is Bleak\nDiplomats and aid officials are also unsure of Rwanda's ability to maintain a stable democracy. They fear Rwanda may become another Somalia, whose society has been so torn apart by civil war that it is barely able to survive.\n\"They will have to start again on Square 1,\" said Armon Hartmann, head of the Eastern and Southern African section of the Swiss Development Cooperation, a major donor. \"They will have to prove to us that they can qualify for our technical assistance. To come back to the level we had just a few weeks ago could take four or five years.\"\nBut in Kigali the violence continues. Rwandan police officers executed 16 people today who were pulled from more than 5,000 refugees huddled in the national stadium, The Associated Press reported. On Tuesday, Rwandan Army troops shelled the stadium, killing 40.\nHundreds of United Nations peacekeepers also withdrew today, reducing the contingent of 2,500 by half, The A.P. said. Among those who left were more than 450 Belgians, 213 Bangladeshis and 144 Ghanaians. The Security Council, preoccupied with Bosnia, has taken no decisive action on Rwanda since the killing began two weeks ago. The Warring Parties\nThe fighting, provoked by a suspicious plane crash on April 6 that killed the Presidents of Rwanda and neighboring Burundi, both Hutu, has been fed by tribal hatred between the majority Hutu and the minority Tutsi.\nBut the killing, at least in its initial stages, was mostly politically motivated, set off by hard-line Hutu who disapproved of a new Government that integrated Hutu and Tutsi.\n\"There is a determination to dominate politically,\" said David Rawson, the United States Ambassador to Rwanda, who was evacuated home last week. \"It is heart rending -- the beauty of the whole place, the responsiveness of the people, their desire for a better life, for democracy and development, set against this intense struggle to dominate, a struggle for political power.\n\"If you get into a stalemate and trench warfare in which the country totally exhausts itself and there is anarchy in the countryside, then we could have taken a step backward into Somalia.\" Poverty Breeds Dependence\nWith about 8 million inhabitants in 10,169 square miles, Rwanda is one of the world's poorest countries, the second most densely populated after Bangladesh. With an economy more than 90 percent agricultural, nearly every bit of land is under cultivation. In 1992, it had a gross national product of $1.6 billion and a debt of $873 million, and more than 50 percent of its budget was covered by foreign aid.\nBelgium, a former colonial power and one of the biggest donors, provided about $30 million a year in the late 1980's and early 90's, followed by France, Germany and Switzerland. The United States provided $20 million a year in development aid until last year, when the figure fell to $14 million as Washington switched its funds to assistance for the hundreds of thousands of refugees created by the simmering civil wars in both Rwanda and Burundi.\nSince the beginning of the civil war in 1990, foreign donors have been putting increasing pressure on the Government to make peace with the rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, most of whom are Tutsi.\n\"This country was conscious of its situation and that it needed foreign help to survive,\" said a senior Belgian diplomat in Nairobi. \"After such a disaster, it will take some time to re-establish relations.\" Putting Aid to Good Use\nRwanda has attracted donors for many reasons. Its needs are desperate, but the country is small enough that the impact of aid can be quickly seen. Communications were good, and rural development was a Government priority.\n\"It was a country with a very good record, proposing and implementing development activities,\" Ambassador Rawson said. \"Obviously our democratization efforts aren't getting very far. If only we could somehow get a cease-fire, if you could find a number of qualified people still living or bring them back from abroad.\"\nBut to many of the relief workers evacuated last week and now waiting in Nairobi in the hope of eventually providing food, medical care and other assistance, the biggest hurdle is not winning back donors but recreating an atmosphere of confidence among the Rwandans.\n\"There will be a lack of trust among Rwandans,\" said Steve Wallace, field director in Rwanda for CARE International. \"I don't think people will be wanting to work together and move the society ahead. There was a huge investment of time, effort and money. Many of the development projects will be casualties of this episode. It is pretty depressing.\""}, {"text": "NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM; Digging Deeper Into Harlem's Health Crisis\n1994-03-27T05:00:00.000Z\nIn 1990, The New England Journal of Medicine published a health study by two doctors at Harlem Hospital. Their summary findings: \"Black men in Harlem were less likely to reach the age of 65 than men in Bangladesh.\"\nBy virtually every statistic, Harlem residents have alarming rates of a vast array of diseases, including asthma, cancer, heart and kidney disease, alcoholism, pneumonia, diabetes and AIDS. The problems are compounded by high infant mortality rates and a high homicide rate, not to mention Harlem's status as one of the most medically underserved areas of the city.\nBut when researchers have tried to get behind those statistics and study the behavior of Harlem residents, they have only used small, self-selected groups -- people in clinics, for instance -- yielding data from which scientists cannot dependably generalize.\nNow, for the first time, a major health study that avoids those limitations is under way in Harlem. Ten researchers are going door to door during the evening, asking 1,000 randomly selected residents questions about diet, smoking, drinking, H.I.V. risk, trauma and stress. The respondents are asked if they have any of a long list of symptoms of illness, and are asked about their health care and treatment, if any. They are paid $15 for their time, $5 more if they take a blood pressure test.\nBegun in 1992 with money from the National Centers for Disease Control, the study is more than half done. Its director, Dr. Robert Fullilove, an associate dean at the School of Public Health at Columbia, said it has had to cope with some problems, including suspicious respondents and threats to the safety of interviewers.\nSecurity measures for the researchers were part of the study's design, with interviewers chosen in part for their street savvy and local roots. The study pays for cabs, and field supervisors are available by beeper. Even so, Dr. Fullilove said, there have been incidents of violence. Two interviewers, he said, walked into crossfire last year, and one researcher had to cope with a robbery after an interview ended.\nSuspicion is a more difficult barrier. Because researchers go out at night, when people are likely to be home, some subjects are simply afraid to answer their knock.\nThere are deeper suspicions.\nThe Rev. Lawrence Lucas, vice chairman of Community Board 10, cited the infamous Tuskegee syphilis study in Alabama, in which black men who had the disease were monitored but not treated. That study ended in 1972. \"Poor people are tired of being guinea pigs,\" he said.\nDr. Fullilove said that that the shadow cast by the Tuskegee study was long. \"We have tried to point out that there is a growing rift between the government and people in communities of color. Though people don't know the details about Tuskegee, they know that there was some attempt to do a study in which black people were exposed to syphilis and lives were needlessly lost.\""}, {"text": "NEWS SUMMARY\n1994-08-04T05:00:00.000Z\nInternational A2-11 A SPLIT ON INVADING HAITI Though it has won the authorization of the United Nations Security Council for an invasion of Haiti, the Administration is split over whether to set a deadline for carrying it out, senior Administration officials say.

Refugees are streaming in from the villages.\"\n[ In a recorded telephone conversation, an aide to Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, threatened United Nations troops with \"all-out war\" if NATO retaliated for the attack on Bihac. Page A8. ]\nWhile the NATO bombing today was substantial, it did nothing to resolve this crisis in Bihac, an isolated mainly pocket held by Bosnian Government forces.\nSenior United Nations officials suggested that a major NATO air campaign to deter the Serbs and save Bihac from being overrun may begin within the next 48 hours.\nBut after a meeting today in Belgrade with the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, Yasushi Akashi, the top United Nations official here, said he had worked out a peace arrangement for Bihac. He did not provide details and it was unclear whether either the Bosnian Government or the Bosnian Serb leadership would accept it.\nThe bombing raids today, made in response to Serbian missile attacks on Tuesday against two British aircraft flying NATO patrols, were aimed at missile sites at Bosanska Krupa, Otoka and Dvor, all within a 50-kilometer radius northeast of Bihac town; the first two are in Bosnia and the third in a part of Croatia held by Serbs since 1991.\nNATO officials said that in the first raid, 24 aircraft attacked the missile batteries, destroying the tracking radars. An attack by 30 aircraft a few hours later hit surface-to-air missiles at Otoka.\nAll aircraft returned safely to their bases. There were almost certainly casualties on the ground, but it was not immediately clear how many, United Nations officials said.\nThe Bosnian Serbs responded by blockading more than 100 United Nations personnel in weapons collection sites around Sarajevo and stopping all movement in Bosnia by United Nations military observers.\nA state of extreme tension appeared to exist between the Serbs and the 23,000 peacekeepers in Bosnia. Indeed, the future of the peacekeeping mission hung in the balance as NATO pondered further raids.\nIn Brussels, NATO ambassadors discussed with what one described as \"some urgency\" contingency plans for an eventual withdrawal of the peacekeepers. These plans are believed to involve the deployment of at least two divisions, or about 20,000 NATO troops. A senior United Nations official said the United States was pressing for more NATO air attacks to stop the Serbian advance on Bihac, which came in response to an attack last month by the Muslim-led Bosnian Army.\nThe American Ambassador to Croatia, Peter W. Galbraith, briefed Mr. Akashi on the proposal, the United Nations official said.\n\"The idea is for a massive air campaign that would initially destroy all the antiaircraft artillery and missile sites held by Bosnian and Croatian Serbs in the Bihac area,\" he added.\nA senior American official confirmed that the Clinton Administration's view was that \"everything possible must now be done to prevent Bihac from being overrun.\"\nBihac is strategically crucial because it borders Serb-held areas of Croatia. If it falls, the western part of Serb-controlled lands -- in effect the western border of a \"Greater Serbia\" -- would be consolidated.\nIf, on the other hand, Bosnian forces hold on to the Bihac pocket, Serb-held land in western Bosnia and Croatia will remain vulnerable.\nIt appeared that Britain, France and United Nations military commanders were close to accepting the American view, unless the Serbian offensive could be halted. \"The political momentum for further air strikes seems overwhelming,\" said Mr. Akashi's spokesman, Michael Williams.\nRichard Duque, the French Foreign ministry spokesman, said, \"The offensive against Bihac must stop. The security zone must be respected. A cease-fire must be established.\" Failing that, he added, France would back all requests for military action from the United Nations peacekeeping force.\nThe justification for further NATO bombing would be threefold: the Serbian incursion into a United Nations \"safe area,\" the threat to 1,250 United Nations troops from Bangladesh isolated within the Bihac pocket and the fact that Croatian Serb forces have poured over Bosnia's international border.\nAlthough Mr. Akashi said he secured an agreement on Bihac today, President Milosevic has lost some sway over Serbs outside Serbia since his decision to impose a blockade on the Bosnian Serbs four months ago, and it seemed very unlikely that he could prevail on them to stop the Bihac offensive.\nMilan Martic, leader of the Croatian Serbs, and the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, have worked closely on the coordinated attack by Bosnian and Croatian Serbs on Bihac.\nIn a letter to Mr. Akashi just before the NATO bombing today, Dr. Karadzic insisted that his forces would not compromise on Bihac. \"We have never determined the safe area in the Bihac pocket and nor was it demilitarized,\" he wrote.\nDr. Karadzic added that until the two sides agree on a safe zone, \"we retain the right to hunt down every Muslim soldier in the area.\"\nThe 1,200 United Nations troops from Bangladesh marooned inside the Bihac pocket are also running out of food, but Mr. Akashi said today that a supply convoy would be allowed to reach them on Thursday.\n\"There is certainly a realistic prospect that Bihac could fall,\" Mr. Joseph said. \"The Serbs are just gobbling it up inexorably.\" He said he was unable to estimate how many Serbs were in the Bihac area.\n\"We have also had shelling in town today, but the general level of fighting has been somewhat less intense,\" he said.\n[ United Nations spokesmen in Sarajevo confirmed that nationalist Serbian troops had taken over Debeljaca, the dominant high ground in the Bihac area. \"They are on that hill,\" said a United Nations spokesman, Maj. Koos Sol, saying troops had penetrated at least two miles into the safe area, as he defined it, and showed no signs of withdrawing. ]\nThe Croatian-Bosnian alliance engineered earlier this year by the United States perceives a critical opportunity in the current NATO attacks to break the Serbs' power to the west. The issue now is how long the United Nations peacekeeping presence can be squared with the stepped-up NATO attacks."}, {"text": "India Casts Its Subtle Spell on Queens\n1994-08-19T05:00:00.000Z\nWE are always happy walking in the bustling Indian enclave on 74th Street in Jackson Heights, Queens. It makes me giggle with delight, the way I laughed the first time my wife escorted me into the marketplace in Pune, or the days we walked the streets in Bombay. The spices, the colors, the characters. It was just nuts.\nMy theory is, visitors are either depressed by the poverty in India or touched by the colorful and artful persistence of life itself. You cannot be neutral. My wife, having been to India 11 times as a volunteer for a child-care agency, has taught me to love it. We cannot afford the carfare to India every week, but we can surely drive or take the subway to one little corner of India. You always see something different.\nRecently, I watched a young couple and their little girl buying gaudy greeting cards and bright-colored bracelets at the Indo-U.S. Books and Journals Butala Emporium, 37-11 74th Street. The proprietor, Bhadra Butala, explained to me that the Indian family was preparing for Raksha Bandhan, the Hindu holiday when sisters honor their brothers, which will be celebrated on Sunday.\n\"It is a very sweet, innocent festival,\" said Mr. Butala, who showed me a book, \"Fasts and Festivals of India,\" which sells for 15 rupees back home. Mr. Butala will be glad to sell you newspapers, magazines and books in 14 subcontinent languages, plus English, or rent you an Indian video, or sell you a sitar as well as a Rakhi bracelet, which Hindu girls place on their brothers' wrists to protect them in the coming year. The brothers are then supposed to give gifts to their sisters. These gifts may be purchased on 74th Street, you may be sure.\nThrough the shifting of the lunar calendar, Raksha Bandhan coincides this year with the annual India Day parade in Manhattan, which is to take place on Sunday. But people do not need a holiday or a festival to visit 74th Street, which has in the past decade become the beacon to other Indians, real or honorary.\nThe other day I spotted an Indian family of four window-shopping in the middle of the block. I asked the father, Jay Isharani, where they were from, and he said, \"Greensboro.\" He and his wife, Varsha, moved to North Carolina 20 years ago, and their teen-age daughters, Reena and Sona, have the mid-South accents to prove it.\n\"We come here to see new things,\" Mr. Isharani said. \"We buy spices and other groceries not available in North Carolina. There are only around 70 Indian people in Greensboro. We look at the new dresses, the new dances. We just browse around.\" The Snacking\nThe Isharanis said they never eat in Jackson Heights because they stay with friends elsewhere. Having tried three or four restaurants in the neighborhood, I agree that there is enough good Indian food elsewhere in the New York City area that it is not necessary to travel to Jackson Heights merely to treat a craving for tandoori or curry.\nHowever, I find it impossible to walk down 74th Street without giving in. Whether or not it is meal time, I walk right into my personal favorite, the Jackson Diner, at 37-03 74th Street and order an uttapam, the south Indian vegetarian pancake that will never again allow you to take pizza seriously.\nNot everybody is going to be charmed by the non-decor or water from plastic jugs, but this hole in the wall happens to be just our style. The fresh daily buffet at the Jackson Diner, which costs $4.99 a person (half-price for those 12 and under), could be the best bargain on the block.\nYou could conceivably visit 74th Street and not eat. But I defy you to not stop and buy a box of mangoes at a market, or pick up a sack of basmati rice or Indian tea or pick out a boxful of snacks at random from Shalimar King of Sweets at 72-23 37th Avenue. The Shopping\nAnd then there are the other attractions. I once saw a giant black stretch limousine double-parked on 74th Street. An Indian Mr. Big and two helpers were loading electrical appliances into every seat and the huge trunk, and then he was heading to Kennedy Airport and the evening flight to Bombay. He was, he let me know, very important in the giant movie industry known as Bollywood.\n\"We sell a lot of stereos, VCR's and hand-held cameras,\" said Sabina Assan, originally from Bangladesh, who works at V.I.P. Appliances at 37-30 74th Street. \"But we also sell a lot of kitchen appliances, particularly juicers and blenders. Our appliances are either 110 volts for the U.S. or 220 for India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.\"\nAlthough 74th Street is generally labeled Indian, people from all over the subcontinent mingle without tension, said Vasantrai Gandhi, the proprietor of New York Gold Company at 37-19 74th Street.\n\"People forget their personal and political differences here,\" said Mr. Gandhi, who is also the president of the Jackson Heights Merchants Association, which has about 100 members.\nMr. Gandhi is a pioneer, having opened a business 15 years ago because he wanted to work near a house he could afford. The residents had once been Italian, Irish, Jewish, Polish, the usual New York City mix, and then the neighborhood was predominantly Colombian, but in the early 1980's, Indian merchants began moving to the block.\n\"I opened Popular Sari in 1982, and then in 1989 I opened Sagar Sari Palace,\" said Vijay Kohli of his store at 37-06 74th Street, where women can buy colorful saris, or more Westernized clothes made of the same bright fabrics.\nFully half the women strolling on 74th Street are wearing Eastern garments, and many of the men have dashing black mustaches and Sikh turbans. The neighborhood has spilled over to 73d Street between 37th Avenue and 37th Road, just north of the IND E and F subway lines and the IRT No. 7 train, known as the Orient Express. And there are plenty of other ethnic shops in the neighborhood: Korean, Thai, Chinese, Colombian, Argentine, Italian. The Flow of Life\nTo sit near the window in the Jackson Diner at suppertime is to observe the very best of New York ethnic life: elderly whites who have remained in the old neighborhood; yuppies loosening their ties as they get off the train; people of Asian, black and Hispanic backgrounds drawn to the smell of spices; mixed groups and couples, and well-to-do families drawn to a pulse of life they cannot find in the suburbs.\n\"I want my children to know their roots,\" said an Indian-born college professor from New Jersey on one of his family's weekly shopping visits to the neighborhood.\nSome of the regulars on 74th Street do not have those roots but wouldn't mind acquiring a few. Two years ago, part of my family spent a delightful Christmas evening at the Jackson Diner, trading sips of the wine and beer we had brought with Indian men waiting out the slow, quiet Western holiday. We discovered that a huge plate of murg tikka makhanwala, chicken in creamy tomato sauce, was the perfect antidote for too much Christmas.\nThe neighborhood is not nirvana. I've seen shoplifters being chased down the block; Mr. Butala has been held up at gunpoint; there is ubiquitous car-window glass in the street. But one thing India has taught us: the pungent fragrance of cardamom, cumin, coriander, ginger, cloves, cinnamon and chilis on 74th Street reassures us that life will endure, and not without pleasure. India Day Parade\nFour marching bands and more than 20 floats are to be in the procession down Madison Avenue on Sunday during the 14th Indian Day Parade. Sponsored by the Federation of Indian Associations, the parade will begin at 2 P.M. at Madison Avenue and 44th Street in Manhattan and head south on the avenue to 29th Street. A festival with entertainment, food and crafts will follow from 3:30 to 7:30 P.M. on Madison Avenue from 23d to 26th Street. The parade and festival go on rain or shine."}, {"text": "U.S. Proposes More Muscle To Aid Bosnia\n1994-11-23T05:00:00.000Z\nThe United States today proposed stiffer military action and expanded use of air power to protect the beleaguered area of Bihac in northwest Bosnia.\nBut Western European nations have yet to agree on whether to take further military action, leaving the fate of the American proposal unclear.\n\"We are pursuing ways to prevent the collapse of Bihac by using air power in support of U.N safe areas,\" a Clinton Administration official said. \"There is a menu of options to stabilize the situation, and we are exploring these ideas with our allies.\"\nThe steps suggested by the United States include bombing strikes against ethnic Serbian forces in Bosnia and Croatia that are attacking Bihac, which is near the Croatian border.\nOther steps include giving NATO planes permission to chase planes into Croatia and shoot them down if they violate the no-flight ban over Bosnia. Allied planes would also be allowed to launch pre-emptive attacks against Serbian anti-aircraft defenses that threaten NATO aircraft.\nIn addition, the United States is still pushing for the establishment of a weapons-exclusion zone around Bihac, which would extend about six miles from the city. Serbian tanks, artillery and other heavy weapons that violated the zone could be attacked by NATO warplanes.\nIn terms of policy, the aim of the plan would be stop the Serbian advance on Bihac and discourage Croatia from entering the war. In military terms, it seeks to move NATO beyond the series of pinprick attacks that have characterized its response to the war in Bosnia.\nIt has been outlined in European capitals and presented to diplomats in New York by Madeleine K. Albright, the United States delegate to the United Nations.\nWashington also wants its allies to agree in advance on the \"triggers,\" or actions that would be considered sufficient to prompt specific NATO military responses.\nThese could include an advance toward Bihac by Bosnian or Croatian Serbs that went beyond reclaiming lost territory, sizable artillery strikes on the town and a \"strangulation\" of Bihac that deprived its residents of food and needed supplies.\nThe aim of defining these triggers in advance would be to expedite NATO military action. One serious concern for Washington is that the Bosnian and Croatian Serbs may surround and take up positions on the outskirts of the town before Western European nations feel impelled to act, leaving the Muslims in Bihac in an untenable position.\nBut while there is growing anxiety within the Clinton Administration over Bihac, there are still considerable impediments to tougher military action.\nWestern European nations have been less alarmed than Washington about the plight of the Muslims in Bihac, as have the Russians. United Nations peacekeeping officials, who must approve any air strikes, have also challenged some key elements of the American plan.\nUnited Nations officials have argued, for example, that the small, poorly equipped Bangladeshi peacekeeping force in Bihac cannot monitor a sizable weapons-exclusion zone. They have argued that only a tiny zone extending about two miles from the town could be monitored.\nBut American officials say the United Nations is taking an overly technical view of the matter and that a zone that is imperfectly monitored is better than none. A small zone would also leave Bihac within easy range of the guns of Serbian nationalists.\nChristine Shelly, a State Department spokeswoman, said today that Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic had contacted the American ambassador to Bosnia today and \"expressed very deep concern about the potential fall of Bihac.\""}, {"text": "Arms for the Revolution: The Bulgaria Connection\n1994-01-27T05:00:00.000Z\nDuring the cold war, members of the Soviet bloc provided covert assistance to fellow revolutionaries throughout the world. The country most often accused was Bulgaria, whose leader for 35 years, Todor Zhivkov, was a hard-liner committed to Lenin's call for international revolution.\nThe accusations were routinely denied and were difficult to prove, if not impossible, especially when Western officials said the charges were based on \"intelligence sources\" that they could not disclose.\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union has opened up some windows into the dark past, but only slightly, with revelations trickling out as a few contrite former Communists open their archives or make confessions of sorts.\nThe Communists in this Balkan country have shown little contrition, and their role in stirring up trouble and spreading Communism would remain a secret were it not that the country's chief prosecutor now, Ivan Tatarchev, is a fierce anti-Communist determined to put some Communists in jail. Working With Little Help\nHe may not succeed, but his investigators have uncovered volumes of incriminating documents that illuminate cold-war history. Many documents are decisions of the Central Committee, often only one page, at the top of which the party officials have signed, in blue and black ink.\nThe investigators are working with the barest of resources as they pore over thousands of pages of Central Committee documents, which have not been released to the public.\n\"There have been times when we thought we had completed the investigation and then we found new things,\" said Mikhail Doichev, a lawyer who is leading the investigation.\nIt seems that every Communist government found the Bulgarians a soft touch: Ethiopia, Yemen and Angola received military aid, as did the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Communists in Bangladesh asked for food and drink for a party congress, and got $25,000 in cash after the Bulgarians decided the food would spoil in transit. Most Went to Sandinistas\nYoung Turkish Communists received full scholarships and at the end of their education in Sofia were given 500 West German marks, about $290 at today's exchange rates, \"for travel to the place of destination,\" according to a decision by the Bulgarian Communist Party in 1984. The Israeli Communist Party received thousands of tons of newsprint.\nIn the 1980's, revolutions in Central America attracted the most attention. The Sandinistas in Nicaragua were major recipients, getting more than $50 million in weapons and equipment. Cuba was in second place.\nOne of the most startling revelations is that Bulgaria provided military assistance to the Communist Party of Honduras in the early 1980's. At the time Honduras was a peaceful country, thought to be free of the revolutionary fervor that had brought the Sandinistas to power in Nicaragua and was fueling the guerrilla war against the Government in El Salvador.\nBut there was a Communist Party in Honduras, though it lagged behind in beginning \"the armed struggle.\" The Honduran Communists recognized that their \"politicization of the masses\" had been slow, but in early 1982 they confidently informed their Bulgarian comrades that \"the time is right to start the armed struggle,\" according to a memorandum prepared by the military department of the Bulgarian party. Masking the Provenance\nThe Hondurans needed arms but they did not want Soviet-bloc arms because they wanted to be able to deny that they were receiving assistance from Communists, which would be hard to do if revolutionaries were caught with these weapons.\nSo the Hondurans proposed that the Bulgarians send Soviet-made weapons to Nicaragua, and that the Sandinistas in turn send a comparable amount of American and Israeli weapons from their stocks to Honduras. The Sandinista leaders agreed, according to Bulgarian documents, but only \"under the condition that they will judge when and in what way to give the arms to the Honduran Communist Party.\"\nIn an unrelated deal, the Sandinistas received weapons from Bulgaria after their leader, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, traveled to Bulgaria in 1987 and met with Mr. Zhivkov. The Bulgarians agreed to reschedule the payments for weapons that had been sent in 1981 and, with no pretense of payment, to send 4,000 Kalashnikovs, 200 light machine guns and 10,000 anti-personnel mines. Planes, Not Donkeys\nIn a deal in early 1982 that will answer many suspicions but raise even more questions for historians, the leader of El Salvador's Communist Party, Jorge Shafik Handal, prevailed upon the Bulgarians to provide pilot training for Salvadoran guerrillas. Pilots were needed for the \"small planes the Front uses for the supply of arms and ammunition,\" Mr. Handal said, according to a document dated June 4, 1982.\nDuring the war, the Salvadoran guerrillas emphatically denied that they were being supplied by air, saying the weapons were smuggled on donkeys from Honduras. And the Bulgarian documents do not say who was providing the planes for the Salvadorans.\nOn another occasion, Mr. Handal made a pilgrimage to Sofia as the representative of the five groups that made up the Salvadoran guerrilla front, which generally denied any Communist connections.\nMr. Handal mentioned that East Germany had provided $2 million in cash the previous year. The Bulgarians came up with 225 automatic rifles, 500 pistols and a ton of explosives, ordering that all markings be removed from the Bulgarian-made explosives and that the arms be shipped through Cuba.\nThe Bulgarians also gave the Chilean Communist Party $50,000 in dollars in 1985, when Chile was ruled by the right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, and Chilean leftists came to Bulgaria for military training.\nAccording to a Bulgarian party document, five members of the Chilean Communist Party were admitted at the military academy in Sofia for a two-year course at a cost to the Bulgarians of 143,700 leva; 10 students from the Socialist Party were enrolled at another military school for six months at a cost of 28,300 leva. (At the official rate at the time, a lev was worth about a dollar.)\nSometimes the foreign Communists devised elaborate and expensive operations to avoid detection.\nBetween 1983 and 1989, the Israeli Communist Party received annual shipments of newsprint, about 385 tons a year. The paper was donated by the Soviet Communist Party, but to hide Moscow's involvement, it was shipped across the Black Sea to Varna, in Bulgaria. It was then loaded on other ships and sent to Haifa, Israel.\nTo further cover the trail, a trading company in Western Europe that was a cover for Bulgaria's state trading company was used, to make the shipments look like routine commercial transactions. Arms for Libya and Chad\nIn another circuitous arms transfer, in 1983, the Central Committee sent 3,000 Kalashnikovs, 100 machine guns and more than a million rounds of ammunition to Libya, according to a Committee document stamped \"Secret.\" The weapons were then sent to Chad, where a Libyan-backed group was involved in a civil war with a group receiving covert assistance from the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\"This is history,\" one investigator said, motioning toward some battered cabinets with documents spilling out.\nBut it is history that may not be known for a long time. There are only three investigators and they have only one photocopying machine, which is constantly breaking down. There is one secretary, who also works for other prosecutors. They have no car.\n\"We have to take public transportation,\" said Mr. Doichev, the lawyer, sitting in an office with a cracked linoleum floor, exposed pipes and badly stained wallpaper. And he said he once had to interview someone when it was below freezing and there was no heat in the building."}, {"text": "For West, Rwanda Is Not Worth the Political Candle\n1994-04-15T05:00:00.000Z\nThe disintegration of Rwanda into chaos and anarchy has evoked expressions of horror and sympathy from the international community -- and a firm pledge to stay away.\nAlthough the large powers have in the past become involved in civil strife within the emerging nations of Africa, it was usually within the geopolitical struggles of the cold war, and those reasons have evaporated.\nUnlike Zaire at its independence in 1960, when both the West and the Soviet bloc were fighting through proxies for control of the large, resource-rich former Congo, Rwanda is small, poor and globally insignificant. Unlike Angola, where South Africa and the C.I.A. backed one faction in the former Portuguese colony in a long civil war against the Cuban-supported Communist government, Rwanda has no large oil reserves. Distrust of Intervention\nAnd unlike even Somalia, where the United States led other nations in late 1992 in an effort to get food and medicine to starving civilians, and ended up in an ill-fated \"peacemaking\" mission, the steady deterioration of Rwanda went largely unnoticed until the the death of its President in a plane crash two weeks ago jolted the country into an uncontrollable spasm of lawlessness and terror.\nAlthough it has not been exactly articulated this way, no member of the United Nations with an army strong enough to make a difference is willing to risk the lives of its troops for a failed central African nation-state with a centuries-old history of tribal warfare and deep distrust of outside intervention.\n\"Somalia showed just how difficult and dangerous the mission of saving a country can be,\" said Robert Oakley, who served as the Clinton Administration's special envoy to Somalia. \"The international community is not disposed to deploying 20, 40, 60,000 military forces each time there is an internal crisis in a failed state.\"\nBelgium, a former colonial power, is viewed with suspicion by the remnants of the Hutu-dominated Kigali Government. In response to the killing of 10 of its peacekeepers, Belgium is withdrawing its 400 troops, the backbone of the four-month-old, 2,500-member United Nations force that has tried to supervise last August's fragile peace agreement.\nFrance, which deployed several hundred troops to Rwanda from late 1990 to late 1993 to bolster the Hutu-led Government after Tutsi rebels mounted an invasion from Uganda, has been warned by the rebels to stay away and has said it will do so.\nThe United States, meanwhile, has no interest in becoming too deeply involved in an effort to staunch the violence. Asked at the daily press briefing on Monday whether the United States, as the world's only superpower, had a \"responsibility to lead any international effort to restore order\" to Rwanda, the State Department spokesman, Michael McCurry, answered that the situation \"will be under review at the United Nations, and that's appropriately the place where that discussion will occur.\"\nThe decision of Belgium to withdraw its peacekeeping troops and the failure of other countries to step into the breach have so frustrated Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali that he wrote the Security Council on Wednesday that he was preparing plans to pull out the Bangladeshi and Ghanaian troops who make up the rest of the peacekeeping force.\nWhen Mr. Boutros-Ghali first proposed the force last September, he had high hopes for it. It was to preserve security in the capital, monitor a fragile cease-fire between the Government and the rebels, expand the country's demilitarized zone, assist with mine clearance and retrain as many as 35,000 soldiers from both the Government and rebel sides, he said.\nBut even with the political will, the financial resources and the military might to make peace in Rwanda, the United States and its allies have decided it would be difficult to maintain it without transforming the country into a United Nations trusteeship or a colonial-style administration.\nBut critics argue that the international community squandered a chance to help Rwanda break the cycle of violence and instability in the months before the recent massacre began. The Security Council member states did not press the Rwandan Government to live up to its promises to respect human rights and curb paramilitary groups operating under its influence. Nor were the Tutsi rebels pressured to fulfill their peace-accord promise to work toward national reconciliation.\nAt the United Nations today, the nonaligned members of the Security Council, which include Rwanda, began a campaign for a resolution that would keep as much of the United Nations force as possible there in order to resume delivery of food and medical aid and to begin peace talks.\nGiven the fact that there is no political will, either in Washington or other capitals, to intervene, the American strategy is to keep expectations as low as possible. Washington's thinking is rooted in a decision last year, following the death of 18 American soldiers in Somalia, to oppose a peacekeeping operation for Burundi, arguing that tribal warfare was so intense that the number of forces needed to stop it would be too high for public opinion to accept.\nThere will be no political cost at home for such an approach. Even hawkish Republicans in Congress who support air strikes in Bosnia have no appetite for intervening in Rwanda, which Robert Dole, the Republican leader in the Senate, made clear on the CBS News program \"Face the Nation\" last Sunday. \"I don't think we have any national interest here,\" he said. \"I hope we don't get involved there. I don't think we will. The Americans are out. As far as I'm concerned in Rwanda, that ought to be the end of it.\""}, {"text": "For an International Agreement to Tame Economic Migration\n1994-04-11T05:00:00.000Z\nTrade officials from more than 100 countries convene in Marrakesh this Tuesday for the formal signing of the final act of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks. There, the major trading nations have an opportunity to offer new hope of controlling the causes of much of the world's irregular migration.\nAs markets in industrial countries become more open and obsolescent industries are restructured or replaced, the demand for irregular immigrant labor will fall. At the same time, increased access for labor-intensive goods in the markets of industrial countries will raise employment and income in the migrant-sending countries of Eastern Europe and the developing world.\nReckless but lucrative trafficking in irregular migrants, now flourishing in Western Europe, the United States and Japan, can be replaced by productive trade in goods and services, promoting welfare in both rich and poor countries. Ineffective or delayed application of the Uruguay Round agreements and continued protectionism would prevent this.\nIn the Group of Seven industrialized countries, some 23 million jobs are supported by merchandise exports, and many more by exports of services. These exports depend largely on the import demand of Eastern Europe and migrant-sending developing countries. In 1991 and 1992, U.S. exports to Latin America, the Middle East and China grew at 10 times the rate of increase to Western Europe.\nThe European Union's exports to these markets increased by 13 percent. Protectionist lobbies need to be reminded that a much larger share of EU exports now goes to developing countries than to North America and Japan together. And these countries have the largest reserves of unfulfilled demand - a vast potential market for the industrial countries to tap.\nNeither the developing countries nor Eastern Europe will be able to sustain such demand unless they can earn enough foreign exchange through their own exports. Trade protectionism would thus cause job and income losses to spiral everywhere. Increased emigration pressure in the developing countries and in Eastern Europe, and more blatant forms of xenophobia in the receiving industrial countries, would result.\nThe Uruguay Round agreements will not benefit all migrant-sending countries uniformly. Food-importing countries will lose, due to higher food prices, and countries receiving trade preferences in industrial-country markets will see the value of their preferences fall as tariffs are lowered. This will include nearly all of Africa and the Caribbean. Most of these countries will need - and deserve - aid in other forms. With an estimated annual gain of more than $240 billion in a decade as a result of the Uruguay Round agreements, the world economy can surely be expected to afford such aid.\nTrade by itself is not a perfect substitute for economic migration. Nor is foreign direct investment or aid. So long as there are wage and income disparities between countries, migration will remain a balancing force. These disparities cannot be erased overnight.\nA recent estimate for a group of migrant-sending countries in Eastern Europe and North Africa finds that a growth rate of 6 to 8 percent will be needed to raise their per capita GNP to the level of France in 50 years. By current growth predictions, it will take 35 years for incomes in Eastern Europe to reach half the average of industrial countries.\nThe limits to the potential of foreign direct investment are also clear. Just to replace current remittances from its workers abroad, a migrant-sending country like Bangladesh would have needed $3.1 billion - 100 times the amount of foreign direct investment it received in 1989. The Philippines would have needed 10 times and Morocco about five times their real investment inflows in recent years.\nBut trade, aid and investment can be molded into a coherent policy of economic cooperation to make migration more manageable and productive. To do so, nations will need to negotiate - building on the potential of the Uruguay Round accords for freer movement of goods, services and eventually capital - a new international migration agreement.\nThe new agreement should encourage labor-surplus countries to adopt broad-based development strategies, with emphasis on job creation, demographic planning and human resource development. To ensure the success of these strategies, the migrant-receiving industrial countries must modify their trade, aid and investment policies. These changes must include planned assistance for restructuring wasteful, noncompetitive industries that depend on irregular immigrant labor.\nThe agreement should provide guidelines to create specific outlets for legal and orderly migration, matching the needs and conditions of both labor-surplus and capital-rich countries. In addition to admissions on family and other humanitarian grounds, demographic and labor-market needs, including short-term movements of personnel for trade in services, should be covered flexibly and harmoniously.\nThe new agreement must envisage increased support for those migrants who are willing or even anxious to return, ensuring their smooth reinsertion as productive and useful citizens in their countries of origin.\nBy enhancing the predictability of the international migration system the new agreement would enhance the capacity of the states to respond to a full range of migration situations. It will, hopefully, put an end to the growing fear that movements of people might get out of control.\n-\nThe writer, senior consultant to the International Organization for Migration, has just completed a study on global migration and development, jointly commissioned by the United Nations and the IOM. He contributed this comment to the International Herald Tribune."}, {"text": "The World -- The New Trade Treaty; A Quick Ramble in a Thicket of Rules\n1994-11-27T05:00:00.000Z\nIT'S a scary thing, this GATT, if only because its name sounds so unfriendly and its details are so obscure. The treaty sets new rules for international commerce by revising the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It is so enormous that President Clinton needed 4,004 pages to explain to Congress what he was asking it to pass, with no amendments allowed.\nThe number of people who have read, and understood, all those pages is no doubt small.\nIf you did read them, though, you would learn a lot of things, some easily as informative as the small print on cereal boxes.\nThere are four paragraphs, for example, on how to determine if that cheese your supermarket is importing is really \"soft ripened cow's milk cheese.\" You could learn that the United States has promised to cut its tariff on Hungarian currant jam -- an Eastern European folk remedy for coughs and sore throats -- from 3 percent to 1.35 percent. As part of its effort to reciprocate, Hungary will cut its tariff on American tobacco from 80 percent to 48 percent.\nSome other items are clearly worth knowing about. Some are beneficial; others look good but have no substance. And the treaty creates a new organization that could have a profound effect on the way trade is conducted around the world.\nThe immediate good news for Americans is fairly sparse. This is a deal that is composed of innumerable little deals, which go into effect one by one over the course of a decade. Here are some highlights.\nQUICK BARGAINS\nToys will get cheaper, and soon -- but not soon enough for Christmas. And most tariffs on pharmaceuticals will disappear immediately.\nThere aren't many toys being made in this country, so there wasn't much opposition to eliminating the tariff -- or tax, if you want to be accurate about it -- on toys. Now importers pay a tax of 8 percent to 12 percent of the wholesale value of the toys. On Jan. 1, assuming congressional ratification, that will drop to zero, costing Uncle Sam about $400 million a year.\nNo doubt much of the savings will be passed along to parents of demanding children, while the rest will fatten the profit margins of toy companies.\nThere are another 1,500 items that Congress determined in recent years were not made in the United States, so there was no reason to levy tariffs on them. The tariffs on those items used to be suspended, but were re-imposed two years ago as a device to shave the budget deficit. Now they will be repealed, costing the Government about $500 million a year. They include some specialty chemicals and equipment to make everything from textiles to semiconductors.\nSAVINGS? WHAT SAVINGS?\nFor many developing countries, opening the United States and Europe to more imports of fabric and clothing was a key demand. But the developed countries have their own textile industries crying for protection, so the changes will be very slow and tariffs will be cut less than on most other goods. Most of the moves to liberalize textile imports are slated for the next century, with 49 percent of them to be made on Dec. 31, 2004. There is widespread suspicion among developing countries, says Peter Sutherland, the director general of GATT, that the United States will find a way to get out of making the changes then.\nBefore succumbing to the temptation to feel sorry for the developing countries, though, it may be worth noting that they generally won't have to do as much to open their own markets as the major industrial economies will. And in some cases they won't have to do anything. Chile, for example, now can collect 35 percent tariffs on a wide variety of imports. Under the new deal, it will cut that to 25 percent. That sounds impressive, until you find out that Chile doesn't charge the maximum now. In most cases, it charges 11 percent. So exporters to Chile will see no savings, even though they can rest easy that Chile won't turn around and increase tariffs as much as it might have done.\nI JUST WANNA TARIFFY . . .\nEven when tariff cuts are real, it may be hard to notice them. The American tariff on VCR's and camcorders will fall from 3.9 percent to 2 percent over the next five years, at a rate of 0.38 percentage points a year -- in other words, less than a dollar a year for most VCR's.\nBut in some cases where there was no tariff, there now will be one, and some of those new tariffs will be in the hundreds of percent. That is because the rules on agriculture require countries with quotas -- that is to say, almost everybody -- to instead set high tariffs that initially will keep out as much as the quota did. Theoretically, the high tariffs will be reduced over time, gradually letting in more foreign goods. This is called \"tariffication\" by the trade lawyers.\nUnfortunately, there is a widespread suspicion that many countries are setting their tariff levels higher than they should, so that liberalization will not in fact be letting in much at all. This has a name too: \"dirty tariffication.\"\nFor example, the United States has promised to let in a bit more foreign dairy products. The combined quota for butter and sour cream will rise from 8.7 million pounds in 1995 to 15.4 million in 2000. The butter brought in under that quota will have a tariff of just 5.8 cents per pound. Then you can import all you want -- as long as you pay a tax of at least 70 cents a pound.\nBUREAUCRATS, BUREAUCRATS\nThe GATT accord establishes a new World Trade Organization, whose panels will decide if countries are violating the new rules. If a country is found to be in violation, it is supposed to correct this or pay damages. But the W.T.O. has no way to force that, and the only sanction it can exercise is to authorize retaliation by the unhappy country.\nA realist might say that such an enforcement mechanism is tilted in favor of big countries. If the United States thinks Bangladesh has acted unfairly, for example, it has a wide variety of trade tactics available with which to punish the offender. Bangladesh, on the other hand, might have a hard time thinking of an effective way to retaliate if the United States wrongly kept out one of its exports.\nJust how the new W.T.O. will work out is a great worry to some. In agreeing to support the treaty last week, Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, got an agreement to establish a panel of Federal judges that will consider whether W.T.O. hearing and appellate panels treat the United States fairly, with a threat of withdrawing if the judges find the panels unfair. Those panels will be able to hear a wide variety of disputes, and their decisions, including appeals, are to be made within 18 months -- a time that seems fast only if you are used to dealing with current GATT proceedings, which can be stalled almost indefinitely.\nThere is disagreement on just how much the United States is restrained from acting alone to pursue trade disputes without going to the W.T.O. The accord's language on this is murky, and it is possible that a unilateral U.S. action could end up before a W.T.O. panel. It is even possible that the W.T.O., by a vote of its members, could decide against the United States. But that would take a vote by three-quarters of the countries in the W.T.O., and that doesn't seem likely.\nLAWYERS, LAWYERS\nLiberalizing trade is supposed to result in additional wealth for all sides, an idea that has been embraced by economists at least since Adam Smith. A study by GATT estimates that by the time all the new changes are in place, in 2005, world incomes will be up more than $500 billion a year. Well, maybe.\nBut it is clear that one group will benefit much more quickly. Lawyers specializing in international trade are likely to find plenty of work as they sort through the thousands of pages of agreements. Senator Dole's success in getting one more place to argue -- the panel of American judges -- will only increase those employment opportunities.\nIf all this threatens to drive you to drink, cheer up. Tariffs on imported booze are going down. The tab on imported beer falls from 1.6 cents a liter to zero over the next six years. And tariffs on whiskey and brandy will fall to zero by 2005. But there will still be tariffs on so-called white spirits, such as gin and vodka. That's because Japan, fearful of an influx of imported sake, wouldn't go along with eliminating them."}, {"text": "NEEDIEST CASES; Cabdriver's School Benefits to Public Hardly Need Explaining\n1994-12-18T05:00:00.000Z\nThe tour bus lurched down Columbus Avenue and stopped near Lincoln Center. Mor-Sourang Mbaye and his companions stared silently ahead, unimpressed. Later, when they passed the World Trade Center, not a single neck craned skyward.\nBut when the bus approached a no-taxi zone, Mr. Mbaye and the other passengers murmured appreciatively. And when it hit gridlock on Third Avenue, they leapt to their feet for a better view.\n\"Just look at that,\" Mr. Mbaye said as cars piled into an intersection. \"People like that are going to make our lives very difficult.\"\nFor Mr. Mbaye, a Senegalese immigrant struggling to learn the warlike art of cab driving, the bus tour was about strategy, not sightseeing. It was part of a private class that teaches prospective taxi drivers -- nearly all of them immigrants -- how to navigate the five boroughs and get along with passengers.\nThe class was begun in 1984, in response to customers' complaints about how hard it was to find drivers who could speak English or find their way around New York.\nThe city requires the class for all new drivers, who have to pass an English-proficiency test and pay their own tuition. Thousands do so eagerly, hungry for the chance to gain a marketable skill and a foothold in the economy.\nAlthough it is dangerous and tiring, the taxi business has always drawn immigrants -- Irish and Italians a generation ago, Bangladeshis and Indians today. Newly arrived New Yorkers often turn to taxi driving because it promises steady work and above-average pay, said Leonard H. Katz, coordinator of the Federation Employment Guidance Service's New York City Taxi Driver Institute, which sponsors the class.\nThe service, which receives financing from UJA-Federation of New York, a charity supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, provides an array of training programs for immigrants, teaching things like business management and appliance repair. But as the percentage of foreign-born cabbies continues to rise -- it was 90 percent in 1991, up from 75 percent in 1984 -- the program whose results are the most visible to New Yorkers is taxi school.\n\"Immigrants drive taxis because they can't make this kind of money in the other jobs available for them,\" Mr. Katz said, adding that cabbies can make up to $12 an hour. \"If they're not driving cabs, chances are they're working very long hours in a very menial job,\" he said.\nAli Sibtain, who immigrated from Pakistan in 1990, earned $4 an hour in a toy store before he quit this month. His boss paid him off the books, and if business was slow, he would send Mr. Sibtain home early.\n\"Driving a taxi means you are the boss; you can work 24 hours a day,\" said Mr. Sibtain, 38. \"I wish I could go to school and prepare for a better job, but I have two children and rent to pay. Right now this is the best choice.\"\nThat is why Mr. Sibtain, a former customs official, sat in a taxi institute classroom on the eve of the bus tour, poring over a map to determine the quickest route from the Bronx to Staten Island. When the instructor, Andrew Vollo, asked a question, Mr. Sibtain and his classmates answered in a singsong melange of accents:\n\"What do you do if you get stuck in traffic?\"\n\"Alternate route!\"\n\"What if you get really stuck?\"\n\"Sit back and enjoy it!\"\nThe taxi school, mandatory for new drivers, consists of a 40-hour course that covers regulations, geography, courtesy and crime prevention. Students pay their own tuition, which ranges from $70 to $275 based on language proficiency. Those who speak poor English take an 80-hour course with emphasis on driver-passenger conversation, learning essential terms like \"scofflaw\" and \"anti-lock brakes.\"\nIf they pass the course, immigrants can look forward to 12-hour days, unpaid vacations and constant worries about mechanical breakdowns, robberies and even murder. (A record 43 livery drivers and cabbies were killed in New York last year.)\nDurand Dormelus, a Haitian immigrant who has driven a cab in New York for six years, said he was happy if he cleared $80 in a 12-hour day. Mr. Dormelus, 38, of Irvington, N.J., said the job was dangerous and hard on his health. \"It's a killer,\" he said. \"A few months ago I had a problem with my back, and it hurt so bad I had to stop work for a while.\" But he says he considers himself fortunate: he has steady work, and has never been robbed.\n\"This is the perfect American job,\" said Mohammed Iqbal, 32, a Pakistani immigrant who worked in a convenience store before enrolling in the taxi school. \"We work hard, we can make as much money as we want.\" Mr. Iqbal said his previous job was the only one he could find in his first two years here. Like others in the class, he said he planned to drive a taxi for several years and save enough money to attend college or start a business.\nIn the 1980's, when fewer people immigrated to New York and the economy was booming, entry-level jobs were easier to find. But now, an estimated 111,500 immigrants are coming to the city each year, and a long recession has forced many to work in the underground economy or seek public assistance. Job-training opportunities are rare, but invaluable, said Ilene Margolin, associate executive vice president of the employment guidance service.\n\"A lot of immigrants are highly educated, very bright, but they have no language skills,\" Ms. Margolin said. \"Our programs help them hit the ground running, to shorten the time it takes for them to learn English and get placed in jobs.\"\nIn addition to the taxi institute, the guidance service operates a business school with the New York Association for New Americans. And in Brooklyn, a trade school trains immigrants, many of them refugees, in building maintenance and appliance repair.\nOksana Lvova, a Ukrainian immigrant who is studying bookkeeping at the business school, said she hoped secretarial training would eventually lead to a high-paying job. \"In America, it is impossible to find a job without work experience,\" said Ms. Lvova, who was an engineer in Kiev before she came to New York this year. \"I hope that this will be the first step. Being a secretary is better than sweeping the streets.\"\nEven when low-wage jobs are available, Ms. Margolin said, educated and skilled immigrants are sometimes reluctant to take them. \"They don't realize that their first job is not necessarily their last job,\" she said. \"They have to go through many levels, layers and careers to reach their eventual goals.\"\nBut even the most patient immigrants grow frustrated. Shib Das, a taxi institute student, came from Bangladesh with an electrical engineering degree. Since he arrived in New York two years ago, he has worked at a fast-food restaurant for the minimum wage.\n\"It makes me cry to see others with no education, no English, working next to me for the same wages,\" he said. \"For the last two years I have not taken one day off, and still I cannot afford school.\"\nMr. Das said driving a cab would help him reach his goal of returning to school. But thousands of others will not have the same opportunity. The demand for job-training programs far exceeds the supply, and government cutbacks make the prospect of new programs unlikely. Mr. Mbaye, the Senegalese immigrant, said he did not understand why the city did not offer more services to help immigrants find work.\n\"If I am not mistaken, the Mayor, Mr. Giuliani, has parents who came from Italy,\" he said. \"If the system did not provide some chances for them, he would not be the Mayor today.\"\nBefore Mr. Mbaye went to taxi school, he worked in restaurant kitchens, clothing stores and, most recently, selling watches on the street. He said he was willing to drive seven days a week to realize his dream of becoming an actor. But after several years of menial jobs and poverty-level income, he is cynical.\n\"You come here with wishes to make money, to make a good life,\" he said. \"But you have to kill yourself to make it happen.\""}, {"text": "U.N. Falters in Post-Cold-War Peacekeeping, but Sees Role as Essential\n1994-12-05T05:00:00.000Z\nThe effective collapse of the United Nations peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia, weeks after the Security Council decided to end an increasingly fruitless mission in Somalia, is forcing the organization and its members to confront two stark truths. The United Nations is faltering in its most crucial post-cold-war task: keeping the peace in a world that has lost its superpower balance. Yet there is no other organization that can do the job.\n\"Five years into the post-cold-war era, I think we've all learned that the U.N. is fairly indispensable,\" said Sir David Hannay, Britain's representative. \"At the same time, there is no lack of disasters and problems. So that means that it's the U.N. with all its warts, or it's the law of the jungle.\"\nAlthough the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations has been expanded since early 1993 under the direction of Under Secretary General Kofi A. Annan, a Ghanaian with years of administrative experience in the organization, diplomats and outside experts say much remains to be done.\n\"The United Nations is still a very weak organization to sustain 70,000 to 80,000 troops worldwide,\" Sir David said.\nMoney is short, integrated training for multinational forces is scant, many nations decline risky assignments, contingents thrown together are uneven militarily and sometimes problematic in their attitudes toward local populations, troops are arriving without proper equipment or clothing, and response time is lengthening rather than shortening as an overstretched system lurches from crisis to crisis.\nBelow the surface lie tensions created by a traditional United Nations peacekeeping culture that often disdains military solutions or even military expertise. Outside the organization there are national politicians, from Washington to Moscow to New Delhi, who rigorously oppose giving the United Nations real power to intervene in conflicts. Alone or together, these two tendencies are debilitating.\nDespite carefully worded resolutions battled over for days or even weeks in the Security Council, the aims of missions are not always clear -- or they mutate on the ground. Respect for the soldiers in blue berets is at a new low, as the abduction of more than 400 peacekeepers in Bosnia and Herzegovina demonstrates.\nOf the 34 peacekeeping or monitoring missions the United Nations has fielded in half a century, 21 were created after 1988 and 17 of these are still in operation.\nIn several new missions, peacekeepers have been thrust into very complex roles that combine elements of military enforcement with relief work, says William J. Durch, a senior associate at the Henry L. Stimson Center for policy research in Washington and author of \"The Evolution of U.N. Peacekeeping.\"\n\"This is where the U.N. has really been handed too much,\" Mr. Durch said in an interview. \"These disasters are political in nature, and when the U.N. goes in, you inject yourself into an ongoing war. At the same time you try to pretend you are impartial. But if you don't come down on those who perpetrate the war you might actually extend it.\" Successes Peacekeeping Needs Popular Will\n\"We've had some successes,\" said Mr. Annan, the director of all United Nations peacekeeping work. \"Namibia, Cambodia, Mozambique recently, El Salvador, South Africa.\"\nHe added that successful operations, some of them very delicate, often take place without any publicity. He mentioned the transfer of the Aouzou Strip from Libya to Chad, and more recently the preventive deployment of troops, including Americans, in Macedonia.\n\"But I don't blame the public for sometimes not knowing what we are up to,\" he said. \"We are not very good at public information.\"\nMr. Annan continued: \"Even in situations where there is no peace to keep, properly organized and properly led peacekeepers can make major contributions. In the case of Yugoslavia, they have fed several million people. They have been able to protect several safe havens. When we talk of Bihac, we forget what the U.N. troops have done in Sarajevo. They have protected Srebrenica; they have made major sacrifices in Gorazde. These are not mean achievements.\"\nHe said those who do not understand the limited peacekeeping mandate and demand more aggressive action are also those who are quick to call the troops home.\n\"I often feel that we are not judged fairly,\" he said. \"The goal posts have shifted, and we are held up to unrealistic tests and then condemned. If indeed the international community wants to roll back an aggressor, you don't put in peacekeepers.\"\nMr. Annan summarized lessons he has drawn from the last few years: \"Peacekeeping works where you have a clear mandate, a will on the part of the people to make peace. The inspiration for acceptable and viable peace can only spring from the leaders and the people in the country.\" The Troops Which Nations Contribute Now\nIf the nature of peacekeeping missions has changed since the end of the cold war, so has the composition of forces.\n\"The first generation of troop contributors were essentially small countries who really felt this international duty and who have no interests beyond that,\" said Iqbal Riza of Pakistan, Assistant Secretary General in charge of operations in the peacekeeping department. \"These were the Scandinavians, Austria, Canada, Nepal, Fiji, Ghana and so on.\"\nBy unwritten agreement, the permanent members of the Security Council -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China -- were never participants. Neither was Israel, which has only recently begun to contribute to operations in Angola and Haiti.\n\"Now, post cold war, there are two new categories,\" Mr. Riza said. \"One is the permanent members, except for China, who are participating. Then there is a new category of countries giving us sizable contingents.\"\nAmong these countries are developing nations like Bangladesh or former Soviet republics like Ukraine. For some, there is the lure of reimbursement. Contributing nations are paid about $950 a month for each soldier -- substantially more that the per capita annual income in many countries -- and governments are not required to pass all of that money, paid in hard currency, on to the troops.\nContingents sent by richer nations with large military organizations come prepared with equipment, weapons, food and water supplies and transportation. Poorer nations, however, pose immediate logistical problems, Mr. Riza said.\nThe plight of about 1,200 Bangladeshis in northwestern Bosnia illustrates this. The troops arrived with no cold-weather clothing and inadequate supplies. Caught in the Bosnian Serb encirclement of the northwestern town of Bihac, they could not receive shipments of warm clothing sent by Germany. They were down to a few days' supply of food when a relief convoy finally reached them.\nSupplying ill-equipped troops delays an operation from the beginning, Mr. Riza said. When Pakistan first volunteered soldiers for Somalia, it took weeks to arrange transportation by the United States. In Rwanda, long delays in bringing in even critical relief supplies for refugees led to anguished introspection here.\nThe United Nations has a standby agreement with more than 30 nations, including the United States, that have pledged troops or equipment. But when a crisis erupts, there is nothing automatic about the commitment, since governments can choose to reject participation, as dozens did in Rwanda. The agreement is described as \"a traveler's check with only one signature.\"\nSir Brian Urquhart, who directed peacekeeping operations for the United Nations from 1971 until 1985 and who is now a scholar in residence at the Ford Foundation, remembers that in 1960, under the American Ralph Bunche, the United Nations was able to move 3,000 troops in three days into the Congo, now Zaire. This year it took three months to respond to a worsening crisis in Rwanda.\nMr. Riza says the key is political will.\n\"When the Iraqis moved south a few months ago, the political will was there in Washington, and everything was sent in a matter of days,\" he said. \"It is governments that really have to determine the priorities.\" The Future Changing Nature Of Peacekeeping\nAware that the end of the cold war has brought not peace but dozens of small new conflicts that pose a catalogue of new challenges, United Nations officials and some national governments are tackling training first.\nOver the next year, regional seminars for military officers will be held around the world to discuss the nature and needs of peacekeeping. A code of conduct is being written to help head off abuses by peacekeepers, a problem that arose in Cambodia during the United Nations' most ambitious nation-rebuilding operation.\nBritain is contributing independently to the training of officers from third-world armies, and Canada is establishing an international center for peacekeeping research and instruction on a former military base in Nova Scotia. President Bush once proposed, unsuccessfully, that Fort Dix in New Jersey be turned into a similar center.\nThe Department of Peacekeeping Operations had planned to set up its own three-member research unit, but could get money for only one analyst, a situation symbolic of the straitened finances of the United Nations at this critical juncture.\nTo cope with a messy new world order, officials here say, there will have to be a new look at arms control. In today's conflicts -- more than 150 skirmishes affecting more than 60 countries by one count -- the preponderance of weapons are small arms, which are killing many more people than weapons of mass destruction. Two United Nations bodies, the Center for Disarmament Affairs in New York and the Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva, are completing a study of small-arms proliferation and what can be done to control it.\nThe most contentious issue in future planning is whether to set up a United Nations quick-response force, which has been proposed by Sir Brian of the Ford Foundation.\n\"The United Nations will have to get a capacity of its own to get into a place immediately before things unravel,\" he said in an interview. \"There is too much of a gap between Security Council decisions and action on the ground.\"\nThe proposal is favored by a number of organization officials and a few governments, led by the Netherlands, whose United Nations representative, Nicolaas Biegman, is organizing a feasibility study.\nThe idea of a standing army has little chance of acceptance by major governments, diplomats say. In the foreseeable future, the United Nations will have to rely for a first response on larger nations with regional interests -- however much this raises fears of cementing spheres of influence: Russia in Central Asia, France or Nigeria in Africa, the United States in the Caribbean.\nMr. Annan argues that writing off a rapid-response force is \"like telling New York City that you will build a firehouse when the fire occurs.\"\nIn a new age of interdependence, where small conflicts can upset regions and throw up tragic hordes of refugees, many of whom will turn up on other nations' doorsteps, countries might look at peacekeeping as preventive strategy, Mr. Annan said. And there are benefits to the soldiers themselves.\n\"They get to work with other nationalities, they go back broadened and with an understanding for the human condition in addition to new military skills,\" Mr. Annan said. \"You can't find a better soldier than one who has those combinations.\""}, {"text": "SERBS PRESS DRIVE ON BOSNIAN TOWN, USING HELICOPTER\n1994-11-23T05:00:00.000Z\nUndaunted by a NATO air raid Monday, rebel Serbs backed by tanks and a helicopter closed in on Bihac today, pounding Bosnian Government forces and leaving several villages burning and hundreds of refugees without shelter, United Nations officials said.\nDespite the attack on the Serbian-held Udbina airfield in Croatia on Monday, Bosnian Serb forces fired at least one surface-to-air missile at two British Harrier jets that were on regular NATO patrol near Bosanska Krupa, the officials said.\nBoth the use of the helicopter gunship today near Bihac, a violation of the no-flight zone over Bosnia, and the direct attack on NATO jets technically constituted sufficient cause for a further NATO air strike, but none occurred immediately.\nBut the NATO allies appeared to be preparing for more raids. A senior United Nations official suggested that a further NATO air strike, this time against a Bosnian Serb target rather than a Croatian Serb one, was likely on Wednesday.\n\"Something is being prepared and I wouldn't go anywhere tomorrow morning,\" he said.\nCroatian officials said the Atlantic alliance had asked today for renewed permission to fly into Croatian airspace and Croatia had agreed to the request.\nMichael Williams, a spokesman for the top United Nations official here, Yasushi Akashi, denied reports that Mr. Akashi had turned down a NATO request for an air strike today.\n\"NATO will take the lead on this, because the violation of the no-fly zone and the direct attack on its planes are direct challenges to the alliance,\" he said. \"Our concurrence is not in question.\"\nWith the situation around Bihac, a Muslim area in northwestern Bosnia, increasingly critical, Defense Secretary William Perry warned today that further air attacks by the Serbs in Bosnia would be met by a more decisive NATO raid.\nUnder the shaky and often paralyzing system in force in Bosnia, both United Nations and NATO commanders must agree on any military action.\n\"If they go in tomorrow or the next day with another bombing attack, then we'll go back and blow up their airplanes,\" Mr. Perry said. At the request of the United Nations, the NATO bombing of Udbina airfield 22 miles southwest of Bihac hit runways but avoided aircraft.\nTwo people were killed in the NATO raid and were four injured, all of them military personnel manning antiaircraft artillery and missile systems at Udbina, Mr. Williams said today. NATO showed videotapes of United States Air Force F-15's using 10 laser-guided bombs on targets including a surface-to-air missile at the air base.\nThe Bosnian Serb offensive on Bihac, supported by rebel Serbs from the Krajina region of Croatia and some renegade Muslim forces, came in response to an abrupt advance last month by the Muslim-led Bosnian Army to the east of Bihac. More than 10,000 Serbian civilians lost their homes to the V Corps of the Bosnian Army, and fled west and south into Serbian-held parts of Croatia.\nThe overwhelming Serbian response against an isolated pocket of Muslims in northwestern Bosnia has again confronted the United Nations and NATO with the difficulties of peacekeeping in the midst of a fully fledged war.\nIn effect, the Muslim-led Government forces have sought and received international help even though they initiated the most recent fighting around Bihac, a town declared a \"safe area\" by the United Nations, which means the allies are obliged to protect it.\nFierce fighting flared today on the outskirts of this safe area, comprising Bihac and its immediate surroundings, but Mr. Williams said there were no reports that Bihac town had been a target.\nThe Serbs overran several villages, including Gata Ilidza, northwest of Bihac, where the helicopter gunship was used, United Nations officials said. To the south of Bihac, they appeared to have taken Zavalje. At least 8,000 Muslim refugees of a total population of 180,000 people in the Bihac pocket have fled the Serbian advance, the officials said.\nUnited Nations military officials reported the heaviest fighting around Velika Kladusa in the north of the Bihac pocket. They said Bosnian Government forces still held the town and the road out to the south, but were under intense pressure from forces including Muslims from Velika Kladusa fighting in units commanded by Croatian Serbs.\nUntil last summer, when it was overrun by the V Corps, Velika Kladusa was held by Muslims opposed to the Bosnian Government of Alija Izetbegovic and loyal to a businessman named Fikret Adbic.\nThey have since regrouped in the adjacent Serbian-held parts of Croatia, and have been armed and led by the rebel Croatian Serbs in the current offensive.\nIndeed, the attack on Bihac has clearly been fully coordinated between Croatian and Bosnian Serbs. On a recent visit to Knin, the capital of the Krajina region, Croatian Serb officers could be seen calling Banja Luka in Bosnian Serb territory to receive their instructions. Only through a coordinated campaign has Bihac been entirely surrounded and the Bosnian Army attacked on several fronts at once.\nIt was unclear whether the tanks being used today belonged to the Croatian or the Bosnian Serbs, United Nations officials said. The tanks approached from the south and southwest. To the east, Bosnian Serbs advanced further onto the Grabez plateau overlooking Bihac.\nSerbs have held close to one-third of Croatia, known as the Krajina region, since a tenuous cease-fire ended the 1991 Croatian war. They fought to resist being part of an independent Croatia when it seceded from Yugoslavia. The areas under their control have been so-called United Nations protected areas since the Croatian war ended.\nCriticizing the NATO strike as inadequate because it did not hit Serbian aircraft or tanks, the Bosnian Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic, said it was \"absurd\" that Serbian weapons and soldiers from these United Nations protected areas in Croatia should continue to be allowed to attack one of Bosnia's six United Nations safe areas.\nHe did not address the question of whether using a safe area like Bihac to start an offensive, as the Bosnian Army did last month, was acceptable.\nPresident Izetbegovic wrote to Mr. Akashi today calling for an immediate cease-fire in the Bihac area. \"We are supporting your initiative for an immediate cease-fire in the Bihac region,\" the President wrote. \"I ask you to take urgent steps in that direction.\"\nThere was no suggestion, however,that the Bosnian or Croatian Serbs would accept Mr. Akashi's cease-fire proposal, which was contained in a statement issued on Monday. The Serbs say they feel their action is a justified response to the Bosnian attack on them.\nThe commander of the Bosnian Serb forces, Gen. Ratko Mladic, warned that he could no longer guarantee the safety of United Nations personnel on Bosnian territory.\nThere were no significant reprisals by the Serbs against United Nations personnel reported today.\nThe plight of the United Nations soldiers within the Bihac pocket, made up of a Bangladeshi battalion of 1,250 newly arrived troops, has become acute. They have only about 300 automatic rifles among them, and are suffering severe shortages of food because no United Nations convoys have been allowed into the pocket for more than a month.\n\"The situation of the Bangladeshi battalion is increasingly intolerable,\" Mr. Williams said, suggesting that a supply route would have to be opened by force if the situation did not change soon.\nMr. Akashi is due to meet with the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, and the leader of the Croatian Serbs, Milan Martic, in Belgrade on Wednesday for talks about the Serbian noose tightening around Bihac."}, {"text": "Computer Vision of Global Warming: Hardest on Have-Nots\n1994-01-18T05:00:00.000Z\nUSING a combination of computer models, an international team of scientists investigating the effects of global warming on agriculture has summoned up a detailed vision of the future that will cheer farmers and commodity traders in the northern latitudes, but not people in developing countries.\nExperts say the three-year study is apparently the first in what is likely to be a torrent of interdisciplinary, computer-assisted projections of the myriad biophysical and socioeconomic consequences of climate change.\nThe study predicts that rising temperatures resulting from greenhouse gas emissions will cause only a \"slight to moderate\" decline in world grain production, causing prices to rise, but leaving most industrial nations more or less unharmed -- and actually increasing crop production in some.\nBut people in already impoverished tropical and subtropical countries are likely to face more starvation and malnutrition than ever before, despite the best efforts of farmers to counter the effects of rising temperatures on their harvests, according to the study's principal authors, Dr. Cynthia Rosenzweig of Columbia University and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and Prof. Martin L. Parry, director of the Environmental Change Unit at Oxford University in England. Efforts to Assess Risks\nThe study was published a month before the more than 150 governments that have signed the 1992 United Nations treaty to combat global warming are to gather for talks in Geneva.\nUntil recently, much of the advanced research on climate change focused on whether significant global warming was likely to occur at all. This debate is far from settled, but many scientists are convinced that without drastic measures to reduce the burning of fossil fuels, average temperatures are likely to rise 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100. Efforts are turning more and more to making precise assessments of the likely risks if this turns out to the case.\nEarlier computer models of climate change predicted similarly disparate effects on crop yields, with some northerly regions benefiting while developing countries suffered. But until the Rosenzweig-Parry study, other scientists say, no assessment had incorporated so many variables into a series of precise, comprehensive predictions.\n\"They've done a terrific job in gradually learning about the agricultural system and how it might change, then building models that will simulate those changes,\" said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, a senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group. \"Any one scenario that they ran might not tell you much, but they've run a lot of them, and the sort of underlying themes which emerge within the broad range of uncertainty tell you something about what the future may actually look like.\"\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, which largely financed the project with technical help from the United States Agency for International Development, is also sponsoring studies on the effects of global warming on natural ecosystems, human health, river basins and the rise of sea levels.\nThe Rosenzweig-Parry findings, published in the current issue of the British journal Nature, involved 60 economists, agronomists and atmospheric scientists from 25 countries who helped prepare \"general circulation\" models of the atmosphere; global food-trade patterns and crop growth in 18 countries, 12 of them in the developing world.\nThe study used crop-yield data supplied by agronomists from Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, France, India, Japan, Mexico, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand, Russia, the United States, Uruguay and Zimbabwe. The crop figures were then examined under three different models of climate change. The researchers then juxtaposed the data with world food-trade projections to obtain a picture of how many people would be put at risk of hunger. A Surprising Finding\nThe study found that although the amount of warming was expected to be highest in the northern latitudes, harming some growing areas and expanding others, the effect on crops was likely to be more uniformly severe in the southern latitudes. This is because the basic subsistence crops the study looked at, including wheat, maize, rice and soybeans, would not fare as well under the stress caused by increased heat and higher evaporation rates.\n\"This is the most surprising part of our study,\" Dr. Rosenzweig said. \"It shows that even with lower amounts of warming, the vulnerability of the low-latitude places, where developing countries tend to be located, is very much present. The high temperatures will push the crops very near the edge.\"\nAccording to the study, crop yields will be stunted by higher temperatures and damaged by increased difficulty in retaining water. And, because increased heat accelerates the growth cycle, the crops that will be produced will have less time to accumulate carbohydrates and are thus less nutritious.\nThe study says the problem will be compounded by sharp increases in world cereal prices resulting from the climate-induced declines in harvests.\n\"These increases in price affect the number of people at risk of hunger,\" the study said, noting that because of global warming, an additional 60 million to 350 million people, most of them in the developing world, could face critical food shortages by the year 2060.\nThe study also found that although the presence of heightened levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would increase crop productivity in the northern latitudes by enhancing photosynthesis rates, its beneficial effects would probably be limited in the southern latitudes by the damaging effects of heat.\nExperts differ over whether the study is based on unrealistically rosy or overly negative assumptions, especially about whether farmers can compensate with new planting techniques or capital-intensive measures like irrigation and new fertilizers.\n\"I think some of their scenarios are fairly optimistic about the ability of farmers to adapt, particularly in terms of the likely availability of capital and technology,\" said Alden Meyer, director of the climate change program of the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental research and advocacy group.\nBut John Reilly of the Economic Research Service, a private study center in Washington, writing in the same issue of Nature, suggests that the study underestimates the determination of farmers in developing countries to overcome obstacles \"if it pays them to do so.\"\nHe also asserts that the study's \"focus on crops that are staples of temperate agriculture may have led to an overestimate of the negative impacts in tropical countries.\"\nDr. Rosenzweig acknowledged that \"further research clearly needs to be done on other crops that are very important in these areas, things like cassava and millet.\"\n\"The real strength of our study was that it was interdisciplinary,\" Dr. Rosenzweig said. \"There's a move to make very integrated models now, and have one model do everything. I like our approach, in which we let the state-of-the-art models in each discipline handle each of the three aspects, and then we work together as scientists to see where the linkages are.\""}, {"text": "Hear the One About the Comics With a Cause?\n1994-09-20T05:00:00.000Z\n\"Comedy is in a sad state,\" say Aladdin and Santos, two young stand-up comedians. That's one reason they founded Not in My Club Productions and conceived the idea for the multi-ethnic comedy show \"Color Blind,\" which is being presented at Don't Tell Mama.\n\"If you go into most black comedy clubs all you hear are jokes about sex,\" says Aladdin, whose parents are from Bangladesh. \"The audience is geared to think that's all comedy is. Then, if you talk about anything of substance -- you know, social or political problems or just what you might feel as an individual -- they get restless. They've been brainwashed into thinking comedy is just about grabbing your crotch and talking about sex.\"\nBesides Aladdin and Santos, who is Puerto Rican, the other members of \"Color Blind\" are two black Americans, Billy Wade and Maleta Apogo, and Rajen, a Guyanese. They have set out to offer an alternative kind of comedy and to counter what they say is entrenched racism in mainstream comedy clubs.\n\"African-Americans and Latinos get very little stage time at clubs like the New York Comedy Club, the Comic Strip and Stand-Up NY,\" Santos says. \"Some clubs have African-American Night or Latino Night, and that's nice. But my question is, 'Why can't we get time on White Nights, the other six days?' \"\nThe name \"Color Blind,\" of course, is what these young comics say the comedy scene should be. As Santos says near the end of his set, \"I know that comedy is not going to change the world, but, unlike everything else, it should not have a color.\"\nThe theme that binds the comedians is their shared respect for biting social and political humor. \"We've all been influenced by comedians like Dick Gregory, George Carlin, Richard Pryor and Paul Mooney,\" Aladdin says. And the fliers for their appearance at Don't Tell Mama (343 West 46th Street, Clinton) describe them as an \"innovative melting pot of stand-up comics\" presenting 90 minutes of \"irreverent, flavorful, thought-provoking comedy.\"\nMr. Wade, gangling and bearded, combines a guileless demeanor and rural Southern accent with some pointedly witty topical humor. His targets at a recent performance included encounters between New York City policemen and undercover transit officers, Elvis sightings, Winnie Mandela's militancy and the O. J. Simpson case.\n\"I thought the chase was a Ford commercial,\" he said at one point. \" 'Notice how smooth the Bronco is moving, gliding through white neighborhoods. Such a simple car to operate. Even two Negroes can drive it.' That Time magazine cover wasn't right, though: made the brother go from Bryant Gumbel to Wesley Snipes, and didn't think anybody would notice. Even my mother noticed it. She said: 'Damn, the boy looks guilty, don't he! If he lighten up some he wouldn't look so guilty.' \"\nRajen introduced himself -- \"I'm from Guyana. And Guyana is a lot like New York. . . . except y'all got food.\" -- before moving into some sendups of contemporary culture. \"I don't know about a lot of these rappers,\" he said. \" 'Yeah, that's how we rap, you know what I'm sayin.' 'Cause that's what my homies is all about. Got my gangstas in the house.' Now, you know he was definitely abused, got mugged by gorillas or something.\n\"I understand that stuff for the first album. But after they make three million, they should try driving by a library and finding out what the hell's going on.\"\nIt was their mutual respect for saying something meaningful that brought the five performers together. Aladdin and Santos have been friends for the three or so years they have been on the comedy circuit. They met Mr. Wade and his friend Rajen two years ago and almost immediately sensed an affinity in their comic approaches, they said. Still, \"Color Blind\" did not take shape until last year.\nMr. Wade had auditioned for a major New York club and, Santos said, had \"absolutely destroyed\" the audience of mostly comedians. Despite the reaction to his performance, he did not get a spot on the show, so the four comics decided to try another approach. The idea for \"Color Blind\" was born, and Ms. Apogo, a comic actress and singer, was recruited as a kind of mistress of ceremonies.\nRajen, who has appeared at a number of clubs and on many college campuses, is the most experienced of the group. Although still in his 20's, he has put in about seven years on the comedy circuit. Aladdin, also in his 20's, and Santos and Wade, who are in their 30's, have less than five years of experience and acknowledge their need for more stage time.\nMost important to the performers, \"Color Blind\" provides them with an opportunity for exposure outside the traditional comedy circuit. Intent on honing their talents before a live audience, they seldom turn down an opportunity to perform and have even appeared in homeless shelters. Their guiding principle, Aladdin says, is a comment Richard Pryor once made about comedy: \"If you're not talking about anything of substance, why do it?\"\nThe remaining performances of \"Color Blind\" are tomorrow night and at 8 P.M. on Sept. 28."}, {"text": "Irving M. Felt, 84, Sports Impresario, Is Dead\n1994-09-24T05:00:00.000Z\nIrving Mitchell Felt, a highly successful businessman who led the drive in the 1960's to build a new Madison Square Garden on West 33d Street, died at his home on Thursday. He was 84.\nMr. Felt, for whom the Garden's Felt Forum, now the Paramount Theater, was named, also had wide influence over the New York metropolitan area's sports world.\nIt was under his direction as a president of the Madison Square Garden Corporation that it bought the New York Rangers hockey club, the New York Knickerbockers basketball club, Roosevelt Raceway on Long Island and Holiday on Ice Productions, which put on ice shows.\nAs a president and chairman of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, he was a major fund-raiser for Jewish causes.\nHe was also active in the arts, having been a member of the board of directors of the Metropolitan Opera Association for 20 years, a founding patron of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and a national trustee of the Joffrey Ballet.\nWhile overseeing the $140 million construction of the new Garden on Seventh Avenue at West 33d Street, he was also chairman or a major guiding executive in about 20 corporations, including Louis Sherry restaurants and the Hotel Corporation of America, which owned 26 major hotels including the Plaza in New York City.\nPerhaps his most lasting monument was the new Garden complex, which opened on Feb. 11, 1968, with a gala benefit that featured Bob Hope and Bing Crosby and netted about $800,000 for charity.\nHe had a flair for the grandiose and was not easily deterred by such bureaucracies as city agencies. He also struggled with some of New York's mayors, threatening to move the Kicks and Rangers out of New York to get some tax relief for his sports empire.\nA highly disciplined man who began his day with a brisk walk from his office at 410 Park Avenue in the 1960's, he often put in 14-hour days.\nHe liked moving from one thing to another. A typical day would include such a wide variety of tasks as a meeting with executives of the Rangers to discuss a player trade, then lunch with executives from various companies that he headed, then off to meetings at Federation headquarters to discuss fund-raising.\nAfter a nap and sometimes a Turkish bath, he would be off again for another late-evening business meeting.\nHe also liked to catch the first two acts of an opera at the Metropolitan and then dash over to his prize, the Garden, to catch the last period of a Knicks or Rangers game.\nHe had a modest manner and would often melt into the crowd at the new Garden or the Felt Forum.\nHe studied and knew well the tastes of the different audiences that came to the basketball and hockey games and the fights.\n\"At the old Garden, they could throw things,\" he observed just before the opening of the new Garden in 1968. \"But here it's much easier to keep order.\"\nHe explained that this was because the balcony seats in the old Garden, on Eighth Avenue at West 49th Street, extended over part of the arena floor, while the seats were much farther back in the new Garden.\nHe and his staff closely followed the trends in rock music, bringing in Elvis Presley for his first performance in New York, putting on a concert to raise money for Bangladesh with George Harrison and being host to a birthday party for Mick Jagger.\nOne of the most successful events under his tutorship was the Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier \"Fight of the Century\" on March 8, 1971, which grossed more than $1.3 million, the biggest gate for any of the Madison Square Gardens up to that time.\nMr. Felt was born on Jan. 25, 1910, and grew up around West 140th Street. His father was a lawyer. He graduated from the Wharton School of Finance at age 19 and got a $25-a-week job with a Wall Street concern, Hayden Stone.\nNine years later, he struck out on his own. He helped to reorganize an investment firm, Graham-Paige. When the firm had an opportunity to acquire a controlling interest in the old Madison Square Garden, he jumped at the chance. The firm bought an interest in 1959 and eventually gained control.\nThe Garden was then 35 years old, and Mr. Felt began to search for an alternative site. In November 1960 he got an offer from the Pennsylvania Railroad for the rights to build at Penn Station. He spent the next eight years overseeing the project, taking pride that it was privately financed during a era when such huge projects were increasingly done with financial help from local governments.\nAt his death, he was chairman of the Felt Foundation and director and chairman of the compensation committee and a member of the audit committee of the Triarc Companies.\nNelson Peltz, the chairman of Triarc and a longtime friend, said that Mr. Felt was a tremendous force in the humanities.\nMr. Felt is survived by his wife, Serene; his son, Jonathan, and four grandchildren."}, {"text": "Bangladesh Succeeds With Family Planning\n1994-10-06T05:00:00.000Z\nTo the Editor:\nRe \"What Success Story?\" by Betsy Hartmann (Op-Ed, Sept. 29), on family planning in Bangladesh:\nSterilization is not the Government's chief method of population control, accounting for only one-fifth of contraception in 1993-94, down from one-third in 1983. The growth in contraceptive use (from 19.1 percent to 45.1 percent) in a decade is attributable to oral pills (about 40 percent of all contraception). The family planning program provides access to essential services, increasingly through nonprofit groups; services for which 24 percent of married women still have an unmet need.\nMs. Hartmann's observations about payment of fees to doctors and other family planning workers for sterilizations are out of date. These fees were abolished more than four years ago on the advice of the World Bank-headed donor consortium.\nThe primary health care services in Bangladesh need much improvement, but we cannot blame the family planning program for their problems. Considerable resources have been invested in building primary health care infrastructure in rural Bangladesh, but it takes time to reach 115 million people. The budget for family planning is in addition to and not part of the health budget.\nWith a flood- and storm-ravaged land mass about the size of Wisconsin, a population density of nearly 800 people per square kilometer and an annual per capita gross national product of around $220, Bangladesh has every reason to be concerned about population growth. Other related areas of development, however, such as education of women, employment opportunities for women and increased access to primary health care, are not being neglected.\nFamily planning in Bangladesh is a success story. A reduction of the average number of children from more than seven to fewer than four per woman in less than 20 years, in the face of severe socioeconomic constraints, is no mean achievement.

Long Live Smallpox\n1994-08-21T05:00:00.000Z\nOf all the killers currently on death row in the United States, by far the most feared and closely guarded is being held, at last report, in Room 318B in the maximum-security wing at 1600 Clifton Road in Atlanta. Only a few authorized personnel have the key to Room 318B, and they rarely use it. The last civilian to gain access, a reporter for The London Times back in 1991, described only a silvery blue, chained and padlocked freezer, wrapped, for good measure, with yards of duct tape. The prisoner inside receives no visitors and hasn't seen daylight in years. Known by many names -- \"Harvey,\" \"Congo,\" \"The Great Fire,\" \"Spotted Death\" -- it is known to most of us simply as smallpox, one of the deadliest viruses of all time.\nTHE HISTORY OF SMALLPOX -- OR VARiOLA virus, as it is officially known at 1600 Clifton Road, home of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- coincides precisely with our own. Human beings are smallpox's only reservoir. Scientists believe that it first emerged more than 10,000 years ago among the earliest farming settlements of Asia and northeast Africa, and with the multiplications and movements of ancient peoples it spread madly throughout the world. Until its final capture in 1977, smallpox killed, blinded and disfigured millions, shaped the outcome of major battles, hastened the collapse of entire cultures.\nThe virus -- a minute pathogen barely visible under the most powerful microscope -- was, for much of history, identified only by its horrible effects: fiery pustules covering the face and body, profuse internal bleeding, black vomit, sloughed-off pieces of destroyed skin. One victim, a poet named Theodore Podromos living in Constantinople at the end of the 12th century, described his symptoms this way: \"First my own body is showered with hailstones from the top of the head to the nails of the toes. . . . Yes, I do justly call them hail on account of their color being white and of the shape being spherical. The body is heated violently through and through with extraordinary torches from the fever.\" The pimples \"on the seventh day become murderous pustules. Have you ever seen a violent shower of rain coming down on a lake, how the entire surface of the lake swells up on account of the closely packed bubbles? Such at this time think of my wretched flesh to have become.\"\nSmallpox's symptoms were unmistakable, but for the longest time their cause could only be ascribed to vagaries: foul air, angry deities, bad seeds in the blood. Even with the discovery of an effective vaccine in the late 18th century, superstition and poor hygiene often overrode science, allowing smallpox to thrive in various parts of the world right up until the 1970's. But now the devastation is done, the culprit caught and contained. In what is generally acknowledged to be the world's greatest public health triumph, a medical team under the supervision of the World Health Organization of the United Nations set out in 1966 for Central and West Africa, armed with smallpox vaccine and special jet injectors. It was to become history's most extensive microbe hunt, encompassing India, Nepal, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen and South America. In the end, hundreds of millions were vaccinated, and the virus was effectively severed from its life source. The last naturally occurring case of the disease was traced to Somalia, Oct. 26, 1977. We know the victim's name: Ali Maow Maalin from the town of Merka. He survived.\nNow, what are thought to be the last remnants of smallpox on the planet sit in frozen vials in Atlanta and in a freezer at the Research Institute for Viral Preparation in Moscow. A simultaneous execution of smallpox was slated for midnight, Dec. 31, 1993. Death was to be by autoclave at 248 degrees Fahrenheit for 45 minutes.\n\"Fifteen minutes in the autoclave would probably be enough,\" one C.D.C. official told me in the months before the execution. \"But we'll go 45 just to be sure. Of course, the people who actually move the virus into the autoclaves will have to be vaccinated. And there will haveto be someone from the other side to observe and sign a document verifying that the execution did take place. We'll probably record it on video as well.\"\nWorld health officials, members of the original eradication program and journalists -- myself included -- planned to be on hand to witness the first purposeful extinction of a species. The sentence was never carried out. A new execution date was to be announced by the W.H.O. at the annual World Health Assembly in May. It was declared, instead, that smallpox's fate would not be decided until May 1995. Of course, many people, a number of scientists among them, find it difficult to believe that smallpox has been kept around this long, to say nothing of the fact that we -- the hapless destroyers of far worthier earthmates -- are now considering clemency.\n\"There was a serious scientific and financial effort made by many countries to eradicate this virus,\" Otar Andzhaparidze, the keeper of smallpox in Moscow, told me in May. \"And if it ends in nothing, it would be as if a piece of music were to end before the final note was struck.\"\nBut what had seemed the obvious ending for such a long-sought adversary has since given rise to a complex debate among scientists about the possible shortsightedness of such an act. Adhering to Ovid's age-old advice that \"we can learn even from our enemies,\" many virologists and biologists now claim that through the use of today's advanced genetic and molecular research techniques, study of the smallpox virus may yield invaluable information about the inner workings and possible weaknesses of the other killer viruses, most of them still at large.\nThat we have brought something like smallpox to the brink of elimination reflects how far we as a species have advanced -- our progression from a vague, theurgically based understanding of the natural world, to a scientific and increasingly microscopic one. That we are now unable to pull the switch on smallpox merely points up the depth of mystery, promise and danger that our new microscopic focus is just beginning to expose. While the conquest of one of history's most devastating diseases would seem to betoken an increasing control over the forces that threaten us, it actually opens far more cans of microbial worms than it closes. BOOKING THE SUSPECT\nSmallpox has not only been caught and excised from the wild; it's been completely captured on paper as well. Last October, two months before the first planned execution date for the virus, I paid a visit to the Centers of Disease Control in hopes of viewing the captive. I was shown, instead, a thick black binder on an oak table in the office of Brian W. J. Mahy, the director of the division of viral and rickettsial diseases. Sitting beside Mahy was Joseph J. Esposito, who as chief of smallpox and other poxvirus infections coordinates the gene sequencing project.\n\"What you're looking at is the complete genetic code of Bangladesh 1975,\" Mahy explained. \"It's one of the more virulent strains of smallpox.\"\nI pulled it closer, centuries of suffering and urgent misguessing resolved in one black binder. It's not very compelling reading: the letters G, C, A or T -- for guanine, cytosine, adenine and thymine, the four nucleotides that make up DNA -- typed out in varying sequences, over and over, up and down the page, for hundreds of pages. But the decision to delay the destruction of smallpox has much to do with the compiling of that text, a relatively new and recently refined technology applied to the young science of virology. No one would actually see a virus in detail until 1937, the year the electron microscope was invented, and scientists are just now beginning to look inside of them to try and answer larger questions about where viruses came from, and how and why they change and continue to emerge.\nIn December 1979, when smallpox was declared officially eradicated, the last thing anyone had in mind for the perpetrator was doing research with it. Only four years ago, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Louis W. Sullivan, announced at a health organization meeting that \"there is no scientific reason not to destroy the remaining stocks of the wild virus.\" Now the end to a worldwide quest is being forestalled by the prospect of what might be found within the space of a few strands of DNA.\n\"The complete genetic code of vaccinia, the smallpox vaccine, was unraveled in 1990,\" Esposito explained, as we sat in front of Bangladesh '75 in Mahy's office and began to unravel the intricacies of the current smallpox debate. \"And here we have the code of the smallpox virus. Most of the arguments for destroying the virus preceded these two milestones. Now we're at the tip of the iceberg again. Vaccinia and smallpox are both members of the same genus. They seem to have a common ancestor. They're 98 percent the same in terms of their DNA. There are only about 13 genes that are potentially different between them, and yet one virus causes a serious disease in humans and the other doesn't. So by comparing the genes of these and other pox viruses with different virulence, we are beginning to get a notion of how they developed. There are still a great number of new insights to be gained by conducting immunological experiments in tissue cultures and mice, to try and understand how the viruses attack a host's defense system and what the Achilles' heel of smallpox is.\"\n\"The difficulty there,\" interjected Mahy, a slight Englishman with white hair, a whisper of a voice and a mind more or less made up to get on with the destruction of smallpox, \"is that to do such experiments requires very special conditions in which to grow the virus. There's been no vaccination since the late 1970's, so we have a lot of people who would be extremely susceptible if the virus was to get out. Nevertheless, there are powerful arguments on the other side, and I think it's fair to say. . . .\" Mahy paused a moment and smiled at his colleague, \"that even here at C.D.C. we have some differences of opinion about what to do with smallpox.\"\nBefore arriving at Mahy's office that afternoon, Esposito had taken me for a tour of Room 211 in Building 7, the lab in which he and his team of biologists first got the book on Bangladesh '75. The project took them more than two years to complete. Within the strange, vast landscapes of microscopia where so much of science now unfolds, smallpox is considered a large virus and therefore particularly painstaking to map. Bangladesh has 187 genes whereas the polio virus has only about 12. The genetic map of a human being, by comparison, would fill at least a million of the Bangladesh-size binders.\nRoom 211 looks like your standard laboratory: black tables and wood cabinets, racks of glass vials, rows of petri dishes, scientists in lab coats bent over microscopes. But the room's appearance betrays little of the otherworldly deeds performed there. Gene mapping is plodding, physical work done within a fleeting, invisible realm -- a topsy-turvy, through-the-looking-glass world where the DNA of a virus is said to be \"too large to handle\" and must be \"cut up\" into workable bits with \"scissorlike\" enzymes.\n\"We pluck this large chunk of DNA out of the virus,\" began Esposito, a gentle, soft-spoken man with curly, dark hair, graying at the temples and the ashen complexion of a longtime lab dweller. \"It's like taking the heart out of a virus. We use enzymes that digest all the surrounding proteins, and we use detergents to dissolve away the fats, and we're left with the DNA. Then we have to use what we call restriction enzymes that cleave the DNA at very specific places, leaving us with bits which we then put in a bacteria, inside a part called a plasmid. When the plasmid replicates, it also replicates the inserted bit of DNA, and then we use more enzymes and detergents to dissolve away the surrounding bacterial material. We keep paring it down this way until we have the DNA bit we want. We put the DNA between two sheets of glass with a jellylike substance in between, apply an electrical charge across that area and then pass it in front of a laser detector that excites the different dyes. From that, we can determine the sequence of smallpox's nearly 200,000 pairs of nucleotides. Bit by bit, this eventually gives us our telephone-book-size map of the virus.\"\nRoom 211 is designated as a biosafety level (BSL) 2 lab. In the hierarchy of precaution taken against biological threats at the C.D.C., BSL 1 and 2 are the lowest level of safety. Work is done there only with non- or moderate-risk organisms -- viruses that cause colds, for example, or bacteria that cause diarrhea. At BSL 3, work is done with organisms that cause diseases like rabies or Rocky Mountain spotted fever for which vaccines or antibiotics are available. At BSL 4, known as \"the hot zone\" or the \"blue suit lab,\" workers visit with highly transmissible viruses or with those viruses or bacteria for which there is no known cure. There are only two BSL 4 labs in the country, one at the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick in Frederick, Md., and the one in Atlanta.\nOnly the noninfectious DNA of smallpox is handled in Room 211. Room 318B, where the actual virus resides, is in a separate complex of maximum security BSL 3 and 4 labs. Esposito is one of the few people with keys to Room 318B, and neither he nor anyone else I met with in the course of my visit that day would even nod in the room's general direction. I knew, of course, that there wasn't much to see -- a room with a padlocked refrigerator -- and I suppose my desire to go there stemmed in part from themere fact that I was being told I couldn't. But somehow, after all the discussions and descriptions of smallpox and my visits to labs where people are performing what could be life-altering work and have nothing to show for it, I felt an overwhelming need to finally see some tangible evidence of the subject.\nC.D.C. officials, for their part, worry that the details of smallpox's incarceration may wind up in the hands of someone with bad intentions. There was, as well, the issue of my safety. Entering Room 318B would have required my being revaccinated. Vaccination against smallpox was terminated in this country in 1972, and doses of vaccine have since been reserved either for members of the military or for medical personnel authorized to handle smallpox and related viruses.\nOf course, there is very little chance of infection from standing next to a sealed freezer, but then odd accidents have happened. In 1978, almost a year after the last case of smallpox was diagnosed in Somalia, Janet Parker, a 40-year-old medical photographer who was working on the floor above a smallpox laboratory in Birmingham, England, contracted the disease. It has never been definitively determined how the virus reached her, but an official inquiry cited an air duct between the two floors as the most likely conduit. Unbelievably, another medical photographer working in the same room had come down with smallpox 12 years earlier.\nAs a result of Janet Parker's illness, close to 300 people who'd come in contact with her had to be quarantined. Among those, only her mother contracted smallpox; she survived. Janet Parker did not. Near the end stages of her illness, her father visited her in the hospital and soon thereafter suffered a fatal heart attack. Eight days following the initial diagnosis of her disease, Prof. Henry Bedson, the 49-year-old director of the Birmingham Laboratory, committed suicide. After the untold millions of deaths caused by smallpox, these are the last attributed to the virus. A KILLER CONTAINED\nMagnified 300,000 times under an electron microscope, the world's most mulled-over microbe looks something like a tiny biscuit of shredded wheat or like a Tater Tot. Its official name, variola, derives from the Latin \"varius\" for spotted or \"varus\" for pimple. It is a member of the orthopoxvirus family, which includes, among others, cow-, buffalo-, camel-, swine- and monkeypox. These other poxes rarely infect humans; smallpox is the exception. The freezer at the Centers for Disease Control contains approximately 500 specimens of variola in half-inch-high plastic vials. There is variola minor and variola intermedius -- the less prevalent and virulent species of smallpox -- and then there is variola major, the more predominant and deadly species of the virus, with a mortality rate as high as 40 percent. Most of the specimens in the freezer were sent from European and South American countries in the wake of the incident in Birmingham. A number of African, Middle Eastern and Asian countries sent their stocks to what was then the Soviet Union.\nRiding on airborne droplets or on the corpses and clothes of its victims, smallpox would enter the body and penetrate a cell, co-opting that cell's mechanism of replication in order to make more of itself. That is what viruses do. That is all they do. On their own, they can't reproduce or metabolize, can't grow or even move. They have no cellular casing of their own, no cytoplasm, no inner nucleus. Viruses are just loose genetic material with a coating of protein and sometimes an added layer of fats and glucose. They are renegade shards of life, of RNA or DNA -- the information for life -- without any means of applying that information. Outside of a host cell, viruses are as inert as the books containing their genetic codes. Stedman's medical dictionary describes them as \"entities on the borderline between the living and nonliving.\" They don't live so much as they wait to enter lives in order to go about mindessly making themselves, over and over, at all costs and to no higher purpose.\nSmallpox is considered a very stable virus, meaning that it can wait a long time in the wild -- for decades under certain conditions -- outside of a host cell before it dies or, insofar as it wasn't living to begin with, before it loses its viability. (Human immunodeficiencity virus, or H.I.V., in contrast, is extremely unstable and difficult to transmit. After a brief moment's exposure to the air, it will wither and dissolve.) In fact, the extreme stability of smallpox has led scientists to speculate about the possibility of the virus still existing somewhere in the wild. \"One of the more heavily investigated instances was in the 17th-century Spitalfield crypts in England, back in the 1970's,\" Mahy said. \"A modern building was being erected and it was necessary to remove a lot of lead-lined coffins found at the site. An extensive investigation was done of the liquors contained in the coffins of known smallpox victims but no infectious virus was found.\" Currently, the most likely place being considered is in the permafrost of the Siberian tundra. A team of Russian scientists recently uncovered cadavers of smallpox victims there. Tests of tissue samples did reveal smallpox antigens or proteins, but not the intact infectious virus.\nAs for the question of what a virus that thrives only within us was doing prior to us, no one can say exactly. \"We have a hint,\" Esposito said, \"that smallpox as well as cowpox and the others of the genus emerged from a common rodent ancestor, a virus whose reservoir was a rodent.\"\nWhatever its origin, smallpox is believed to have formerly been one of the harmless pox strains that infect domesticated animals. Then, through pro longed proximity to the early farmers of Africa and Asia, it made what's known in virology as a cross-species transfer, genetically mutating in such a way as to leap over and adapt to us. From Africa, it is thought to have spread to the Hittites in the 14th century B.C. and later to ancient Greece and Persia, and from the Persians to the Huns and with them into China where the disease was known as \"Hunpox.\" Alexander the Great's army was ravaged by smallpox during a campaign in India in the fourth century B.C. The mummy of the Egyptian pharaoh Ramses in the Cairo Museum shows signs of death by smallpox. In ancient Greece, the loss of faith in the sanctity of the polis and the subsequent decline of Athens is thought to have been largely the work of variola major. In his book, \"Princes and Peasants: Smallpox in History,\" Donald R. Hopkins, a member of the original eradication program in West and Central Africa, cites Thucydides' description of a devastating smallpox epidemic in 430 B.C.: \"Athens owed to the plague the beginnings of a state of unprecedented lawlessness. . . . As for the gods, it seemed to be the same thing whether one worshipped them or not when one saw the good and the bad dying indiscriminately.\"\nSmallpox ravaged Rome with a major epidemic in the second century A.D., killing the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. It spread across Europe and would continue to visit plagues upon its major cities up until the end of the 19th century. Generations of European royalty were ravaged by smallpox. In the 16th century, the disease was introduced into southern Mexico by one African slave on board the ship of the conquistador Panfilo de Narvaez and it would end up killing millions of Aztecs, Mayans and Incas, facilitating the Spanish conquest. The native peoples of North America and Canada were devastated by smallpox disseminated, at times intentionally, by settlers. In 1763, Sir Jeffrey Amherst, commander in chief of British forces in North America, ordered his troops to hand out smallpox-contaminated blankets among the Iroquois. This is the first known instance of biological warfare.\nAlthough an effective vaccine was discovered at the end of the 18th century, the disease continued to plague major cities in the United States and Canada well into the 19th century. Prior to the vaccine, people could only guess at how to combat smallpox. They tried everything from palm oil to powdered horse excrement. Bloodletting and purgatives were common treatments, but perhaps the most universal and useless therapy stemmed from the belief that the color red could promote a cure. From before the Christian era right up until the end of the 20th century, in cultures as disparate as the Japanese and the British, variola victims -- the royal and the rank and file alike -- were being wrapped in red blankets, dressed in red clothes, having their rooms fully draped in red curtains, even being exposed to the rays of special red lamps, all by way of trying to excite the blood and bring it and the malady thought to be dwelling within it to the surface.\nRemarkably, successful inoculation against smallpox was being practiced in China, India and Africa over a thousand years ago. As early as the 10th century, the Chinese were taking the dried scabs of previous smallpox victims and blowing them up the nose of healthy people to ward off the disease. In the early 1700's, a handful of attentive travelers to the Near East and Africa brought word of inoculation back to Europe and North America, where it soon became a widespread practice. Then, in 1796, a British doctor named Edward Jenner conducted some experiments based on the stories of English milkmaids who, having contracted cowpox from milking infected cows, claimed to have immunity from smallpox. He soon determined that by injecting healthy people with a closely related pox, vaccinia, they would have immunity to variola. It would be a long time, however, before vaccination was established as a uniform practice. For more than 70 years after Edward Jenner's discovery, the world was still unaware of the existence of germs or microorganisms. It was therefore quite a leap for some to accept that they could protect themselves against one dreaded disease by being injected with another that infects cows.\nBut in the long history of the battle with smallpox perhaps the most substantial leap of imagination was made back in the mid-1960's with the decision to try to eliminate the virus from the planet altogether. \"It began with a proposal by Viktor Zhdanov,\" Donald A. Henderson, the former director of the smallpox eradication program and now a senior science adviser in the Department of Health and Human Services, told me one afternoon in his Washington office. \"He was then the Vice Minister of Health for the Soviet Union. It was the first serious statement by anyone that we could even do this.\"\nNot long after a shocking outbreak of smallpox in New York City in 1947, in which more than six million residents had to be vaccinated, Henderson was apppointed head of a smallpox surveillance unit that urged the Army to develop a new vaccination device: the \"ped-o-jet,\" a foot-powered hydraulic injector that would play a major role in the eventual success of the eradication program, enabling health workers to travel widely, without recourse to electricity. Along with the ped-o-jet and a recently refined, freeze-dried vaccine that, unlike previous versions of vaccinia, retained its potency in any climate for months without refrigeration, the members of the eradication campaign also had smallpox on their side.\n\"The virus's very visible and somewhat plodding path of infection made it relatively easy to track,\" William H. Foege told me at the C.D.C. last October. Foege had been working as a medical missionary for the Lutheran Church in eastern Nigeria when the eradication program began and now works for the Carter Center in Atlanta. \"Two weeks after people came down with the disease, they were either dead or immune for life.\"\nFoege was also the architect of a new strategy called surveillance-containment: isolating areas of outbreak and then vaccinating there. This freed health workers from the burden of mass vaccination and preserved often-limited supplies of vaccine. In January 1968, a year after the start of the initial West and Central Africa campaign, a ceremony was held on a soccer field in Ghana to celebrate the 25-millionth vaccination. According to the then-director of the C.D.C., David J. Sencer, the recipient, a schoolgirl named Rebecca Ansah Asamoah, \"screamed bloody murder.\" Two and a halfyears later, the complete eradication of smallpox in all 20 of the targeted countries was confirmed.\n\"I remember when we came up with the new strategy,\" Foege recalled excitedly. \"We were sitting up, my fellow workers and I, late at night around a kerosene lantern in a little hut in Nigeria, miles from any road, deliberately trying to outthink smallpox. That's a troubling image when you consider that a virus hasn't even the semblance of a brain. And do you know what question we asked? 'What would we do, where would we go next, if we were a smallpox virus?' \"\nOf course, what Foege and the others could never have imagined, sitting up in their hut that night, is that nearly 20 years after the final capture of smallpox, the search would resume within the virus itself. THE SILENCE OF THE LABS\nAmong the people I met in Esposito's Room 211 lab that day was a research microbiologist named Janice Knight. In order to map the genetic code of smallpox, the DNA first had to be extracted from the virus. To do this, the prisoner had to be taken from the freezer in 318B and brought to the maximum security BSL 4 laboratory where it was thawed, placed in tissue culture and brought briefly back to life. This was the job of Janice Knight and her colleague Robert Massung. They have the dubious distinction of being the last people on earth to visit the live variola virus.\n\"The virus was transported in a sealed container to the maximum security unit in Building 15,\" Knight recalled matter of factly. \"I put on my scrub suit and rubber gloves, took the vial with the frozen virus and went inside the containment area just outside the lab door where I put on a full-body pressurized space suit. I zipped it up and then passed through the air-lock doors with the vial of smallpox into the BSL 4 lab.\"\nLike Room 318B, the BSL 4 lab is normally off limits to someone like myself, but it just happened to be in a washdown stage between projects the day I was there and so later that afternoon I was allowed access. Upon entering the antechamber outside the lab's double air-lock entrance doors, I saw a row of the blue plastic \"space suits\" Janice Knight had spoken of, hanging from a set of wall hooks. They look like outsize feet pajamas with bright yellow rubber gloves attached at the wrists, clear visor hoods and metal air-valve attachments jutting from the side.\n\"You don't have much feeling in your hands, because of the gloves over other gloves,\" Knight said. \"You have to move very slowly so you don't knock things over.\"\nInside the main lab room, coiled red air hoses dangle every few feet or so from the ceiling. A worker moving from station to station or room to room detaches from one hose and hooks up to the next. There's enough air in the suit to go two or three minutes without hooking up to another hose. Air pressure within the lab's rooms decreases the farther you move toward the center of the building, so that all air flows inward and then up through a special filtration system. The floor above and the one below the BSL 4 lab are entirely devoted to maintaining and purging its environment. Upstairs, there are banks of HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filters designed to trap the most minute particles flowing in and out of the lab. Downstairs, there are rows of backup air-supply tanks, a huge diesel back-up generator and two 1,000-gallon tanks for heating and decontaminating liquid waste before it's cooled and released into the public sewer system.\n\"Once inside the lab in the suit, you're pretty much isolated,\" Knight said. \"It's just you and your air hose. It's a bit like scuba diving.\"\nWhite-tiled, air-locked, soundless, the lab rooms did seem to be deep under water. The light inside was flashbulb bright, exposing every flat surface and corner. A four-foot-high, square liquid nitrogen freezer for storing vials was set against one wall with the lid open. There was a set of glass-enclosed work tables known as \"laminar-flow biosafety cabinets.\" They, too, have negative air pressure and just an 8-inch-wide opening in front for workers to stick their hands through and work with their \"hot agents.\"\n\"I thawed the virus,\" Janice Knight went on, \"and then grew it up on human tissue. We have established cell lines from human tissue, immortal cell lines. It's considered immortal because you can keep splitting the cells and passing them along forever.\"\nAfter variola sprang to life and began replicating, Knight extracted the DNA and placed it in a solution of phenol. All solid waste material from the workday goes to the innermost BSL 4 room, where there some trash bins with bright red biohazard symbols on them and two autoclaves built into the back wall. All workers exit BSL 4 through a set of double-air-lock doors, the space between which also serves as a chemical shower. A worker hooks up to a red air hose and must stand for a minimum of four minutes under a steady spray of Lysol.\n\"I had the DNA in a one-and-a-half-milliliter epindorph centrifuge tube,\" Knight said. \"I carried it out by hand. The exterior of the tube had been washed in Clorox and then put inside another sterile tube within a sterile hood, and all that was brought with me through the Lysol shower so there was no way any virus was coming out with me.\"\nIt all might sound a bit extreme until you hear about the other kinds of creatures handled in BSL 4. There's the group of tick-borne encephalitis viruses, for example, or the Muerto Canyon hantavirus that last summer killed 27 people in the Southwest. A previously unknown and far more virulent relative of the hantavirus that originated in Korea and China, Muerto Canyon was first identified in the BSL 4 lab less than three weeks after its sudden and mysterious emergence. There have since been isolated cases across the United States, from California to New York. The virus causes influenzalike symptoms for the first few days and then leads to pulmonary edema. The lungs fill with bloody fluid and victims literally drown in themselves.\nThe hemorraghic fever viruses are held in BSL 4: Marburg, Lassa, Junin, Machupo, Congo-Crimean and Ebola -- both Ebola Sudan and one of the deadliest human viruses ever known, Ebola Zaire. Classified as a filovirus because of it's gnarled, threadlike appearance, Ebola Zaire made a sudden, memorable debut back in 1976 when it struck 55 villages near the river for which it's named. The virus bedevils the blood, causing it to simultaneously clot and thin. Clots lodge throughout the body, inducing internal hemorrhaging. As the disease advances, virus-ridden blood streams from the mouth, nose, anus and up through the skin, rendering it the consistency of rotting fruit. The virus seems to spread this way, on rivulets of its victims' escaping blood. Ebola killed nearly 90 percent of those it infected. Only AIDS and rabies have higher death rates. SECRETS OF A PATHOGEN\nI was pleased to leave BSL 4 that day, to get away even from the ghosts of such beings. I remember walking the grounds around the C.D.C. complex the following morning. Directly across the road from the BSL 4 lab, which is both earthquake- and tornado-proof and looks from the outside like some post-modern military bunker, is a day-care center for children. It was a bright, cloudless day and I could hear on the wind the sound of the children playing somewhere out back. This is where we are now in the world, I thought: advanced to the point where we can label and keep previously unknowable threats insidehuge buildings within a normal day and yet remain as oblivious and vulnerable as ever to those threats.\nOne of the defining conceits of modernity is that we have dispensed with plagues, that we are rapidly rendering the world as harmless and sterile as a suburban kitchen counter top. The spread of AIDS has by now disabused many of us of such a notion. And yet our mind-set about the natural world still seems to be stuck midway between the old assumptions of our singularity and supremacy and the plain biological reality that new viruses like Ebola continue to point up to us: that we are but one of many competing species on the planet and will be long outlived by organisms like viruses.\nAs they have already done with smallpox, scientists have begun to identify the viral genus or family to which H.I.V. belongs. One close cousin was discovered a few years after H.I.V. and is now designated as H.I.V.-2. It is endemic to the western coast of sub-Saharan Africa, is barely present in those parts of Africa where H.I.V. is rampant and causes far milder symptoms, allowing victims to live longer than victims with H.I.V. Another relative is simian immunodeficiency virus, or S.I.V., which is nearly identical genetically to H.I.V.-2 and, as near as anyone can tell, has been infecting, though not killing, an African monkey known as the sooty mangabey for thousands of years. Scientists believe that H.I.V. began as a simian immunodeficiency virus and, just as smallpox is thought to have done thousands of years ago, made one of those cross-species leaps to humans. Muerto Canyon hantavirus and the hemorrhagic fevers are thought to have reached us by similar means. Whatever the origin of viruses might be, and however peripheral and inert their existence may seem, they apparently have no trouble keeping up with us.\nThere have been, along with the conquest of smallpox, some other notable advances made against killer pathogens. The W.H.O. has set a target date of late 1995 for the eradication of dracunculiasis, or Guinea worm, a particularly nasty, water-borne organism that bores through the skin of the feet and grows into a long stringy worm that eats away at the connective tissue of the legs and trunk and can only be drawn back out by winding it slowly around a stick. Polio has been slated by the W.H.O. for complete eradication by the year 2000 and measles, which still kills over two and a half million children a year, for some time shortly thereafter. In fact, one of the reasons that so much attention is being paid to the decision made about smallpox is that both advocates and opponents of the destruction see the final outcome of this case as establishing a precedent.\n\"It's a symbolic thing,\" Mahy told me in his office that afternoon. \"It says that mankind is not afraid of eliminating potential dangers.\"\nStill, these are somewhat hollow victories. Like smallpox, what polio and measles have in common is us. Human beings are their only reservoir, and this makes them easier to isolate and attack. As for Ebola Zaire, Muerto Canyon and the others, they are known as \"emerging viruses.\" The term is a bit misleading in that such viruses have been around for ages. It's just that we are now interrupting them and commingling with them more often, especially as civilization continues to advance upon previously undeveloped environments, like rain forests, where the majority of these \"emerging\" viruses wait. The threat of a catastrophic outbreak is never more than a jet flight away.\nThe presence of these new threats would seem to render a retired death-row prisoner like smallpox an afterthought. \"In simple economic terms,\" Mahy said, \"many ask whether we really want to start funding research on a virus we've eradicated when we have so many new diseases like Ebola and the new hantavirus to deal with?\"\nBut to those hoping for another stay of execution, emerging viruses are precisely why something like smallpox should be kept around. To Esposito and scores of others, smallpox is the viral equivalent of a Hannibal Lecter, capable of enlightening those who dare to visit with it, of shedding insight on the methods of other serial-killer viruses.\nOne suspect that virologists are keeping an eye on is an old cousin of variola, monkeypox. The virus was first discovered in the monkeys of Zaire but its actual reservoir has since been determined to be squirrels. For reasons still unclear, this particular pox virus is not readily transmitted to or among people. Only some 300 cases have been recorded, and no single outbreak has spread beyond five people. But many worry about monkeypox making the necessary and not unlikely cross-species mutations that would allow it to, as Esposito puts it, \"fill the niche that we voided by vaccinating the world against smallpox.\"\n\"How would we deal with that?\" Esposito asked. \"Vaccinia would be the normal countermeasure, but in Zaire, where there is such a high rate of AIDS, you can't prescribe smallpox vaccine because people with an immunodeficency would die from the vaccine. It presents one with a very odd ethical problem. Do you kill people trying to save them from monkeypox or let them die from either it or AIDS? Or could we find another strategy? By holding on to the actual smallpox virus and conducting experiments, we've already begun to learn how smallpox works.\" What has Esposito and others in the field most intrigued is the discovery of previously unknown viral proteins that smallpox produces. These proteins block the host cell's natural ability to stave off infection. A better understanding of how this happens, Esposito said, might one day help scientists devise a means of combatting viruses without relying on vaccines -- a strategy that could instead stop the production of the proteins, or even employ them to some curative end.\n\"It is unbelieveable to me that people would want to destroy this virus now,\" said Wolfgang K. Joklik, former chairman of the department of microbiology and immunology at Duke University, in a recent phone conversation. \"We just discovered the smallpox protein that tells the cell to shut down when invaded by a virus. This is how smallpox gets the cell to manufacture more smallpox. Now this is a gene we knew nothing about a year ago, and there are a hundred more of them. It seems absolutely ridiculous to me to throw them away, especially when we have something like AIDS, which we're nowhere near being able to stop and will infect hundreds of millions of people. By using smallpox to find out more about the components of the human defense mechanism, we might be able to determine which of the cell's components the AIDS virus interacts with and overcomes.\"\nIn fact, a number of virologists have noted that the eradication of smallpox in Africa and the rise of AIDS were coincidental, and it has been suggested that there may be a causal relationship there as well. Hundreds of millions of people were vaccinated, and the speculation is that AIDS may have been sparked either through the repeated use of H.I.V.-contaminated ped-o-jet lancets or via a phenomenon known as co-infection in which the injected vaccinia virus somehow activates a latent H.I.V. infection. There is no way to verify such a theory, but if it is true, and if what we were to learn from smallpox could help us in some way in the fight against a virus like H.I.V., then the story of the ancient scourge that is variola will have truly come full circle.\n\"I will go along with what the W.H.O. decides,\" Esposito told me before I left the C.D.C. that afternoon. \"But in my view, we need the whole intact virus and its gene products, the virus proteins, in order to learn. We just don't know enough about viruses or the human defense system to say that we don't. To me it's a matter of preparedness for the future.\" AWAITING THE VERDICT\nIn just over two weeks, the Ad Hoc Committee on Orthopox Virus Infections will be meeting in Room E110 at the W.H.O. headquarters in Geneva to make its final recommendation on the fate of variola. The decision will be passed along to the W.H.O.'s executive board, whose members will meet next January and then pass along the minutes of that meeting along with their recommendation to all 187 member countries of the W.H.O. After an open discussion among the representatives of those countries at the annual World Health Assembly, a final decision will be announced.\nFrom all early indications, things don't look good for smallpox. Of the 11 doctors on the committee meeting this Sept. 9 in Geneva, it appears that at least 9 of them will vote to destroy. When I brought up the matter with Peter Greenaway, of the Department of Health in London, at a meeting in Geneva in January, he seemed decidedly impatient with the whole business. \"Biological species have been disappearing for thousands of years,\" he told me. \"Are we really worrying about one particularly nasty virus?\"\nAt bottom, those who favor destroying smallpox do so not out of hubris but out of a carefully weighed concern that the killer virus might somehow escape and wreak havoc on a nonvaccinated world. Henderson, who as head of the eradication program would have as much right as anyone to bear a personal vendetta against smallpox, says: \"I've thought about it a lot and I feel we can get all we need from variola's relatives without the risk of keeping the one strain that's harmful to us. So I think we should destroy.\"\nThose who favor saving smallpox think the dire escape scenarios are greatly exaggerated and they note that scientists would know how to control an outbreak. \"If it did happen to get out,\" Joklik added, \"and a few people were to get sick, that would be a terrible thing. But why are we so caught up in the age of the individual? Why can't we see down the road and understand how many lives we might save with what we learn from this virus?\"\nIt's difficult to know whether the opinions of the Geneva committee accurately reflect those of scientists at large. But if a round-table discussion on the subject in Glasgow, Scotland, last August is any indication, the answer is no. Of the more than 500 virologists, biologists and microbiologists from around the world who participated, at least half argued for preserving smallpox.\nParadoxically, those calling for destruction also invoke the new gene sequencing technology now to bolster their argument. They assert that with the genetic maps and DNA clones of smallpox on hand, we have all that's required for future research -- even the ability to reassemble smallpox from the separate pieces of DNA. The problem there, said Stephen S. Morse, a virologist at Rockefeller University, is that we can't be sure the reassembled smallpox will be exactly the same as the original and create the same effects within the host cell as the natural variola virus.\nIn essence, the wide-ranging debate about smallpox comes down to how much one believes in the riches that might be mined from one-millionth of a micron. This is the space in which most new scientific discoveries are being made these days, and it seems now, as with the supercollider and the space program, that the continued pursuit of smallpox depends on our willingness to fund the exploration of potential dead ends.\nBut for now, at least, it appears that more immediate worldly concerns will preclude our making any otherworldly advances with smallpox. \"I was absolutely against destroying the virus a few years ago,\" Yuri Z. Ghendon, a top health official at the W.H.O. and the former director of the department of general virology at the Moscow Research Institute, told me in Geneva in January. \"I fought with all the committee members who wanted to eradicate, telling them that if we keep the virus in safe conditions, nothing will happen. But with all the incidents of late, the terrorists' bombings of the World Trade Towers in New York, bombings in London and Italy, I have changed my view. Now, when we discuss this smallpox matter so widely, how do you know terrorists won't read this and go to the C.D.C. with a bomb? And look at the situation with the political uprising in Moscow last October. What if a fire had been set to the Research Institute where we store the virus? The institute is not like the C.D.C. It's a very old building.\" BEHIND CORRODING BARS\nI flew to Moscow in May in one last attempt to view variola in captivity. My chances appeared good at the outset. I'd arranged to meet with the lab director, Otar Andzhaparidze, who agreed to give me a tour of the Research Institute. But a series of articles in the Moscow newspapers criticizing the poor conditions and lack of security at the lab had left Andzhaparidze feeling less than kindly toward reporters.\nWe met in a vast empty conference room on the second floor of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences -- one of downtown Moscow's many crumbling, pale yellow, 19th-century buildings. The bottle of expensive Scotch I'd bought as a last-ditch offering was set on the table between us. Andzhaparidze regarded it with a slow stroke of his aged, jowly, Georgian chins, put the bottle in his black briefcase and then handed me in return a stack of official documents that he said would explain the present position of the Russian Government about the keeping of smallpox. \"Not such a good trade for you,\" he said, laughing.\nOver the next few minutes I tried in various ways to bring up the subject of my lab tour and then the doctor finally laid down the law. \"Some of the articles written,\" he began, \"can be regarded as direct methodical directions for all kinds of criminals and terrorists to come in and find the virus. When I saw this, I decided to defend ourselves and deprive correspondents the pleasure of writing nasty things.\"\nThe following afternoon I took a cab out to the Research Institute to have a look around on my own. It's a drab yellow, four-story brick building on the industrial southeastern edge of the city. There's a bent iron-spoked fence running around it, topped with barbed wire, and a small brick guardhouse out by the front gate through which all workers and deliveries come and go. Looking in, I could see white-smocked women wheeling bins of medical waste to a large receptacle under a tin shed out back.\nSmallpox is said to be up in a fourth-floor lab at the end of a long, dark hallway in a pair of ordinary-looking kitchen freezers that are set behind a pair of glass doors, locked and wired with special alarms to summon Moscow police from a nearby station in the event of an attempted break-in. The lab does have someone on duty around the clock to watch the place, but there are no armed guards or private security personnel as there are at the C.D.C. -- although Andzhaparidze did say that on the night of the October rebellion he'd hired members of an independent security group armed with tear-gas pistols.\n\"The atmosphere was alarming,\" he recalled. \"But everything worked out. We've been keeping the virus for about 30 years and so far God has spared us.\"\nI felt a bit silly standing outside the Research Institute that day, having flown half way across the world just to stare up from a sooty sidewalk in the vague direction of the other side's smallpox. I wondered if the dilapidation of the institute and of the country around it would ultimately determine the fate of variola. In a sense, the building's crumbling superstructure is incidental to the issue of smallpox's security. W.H.O. officials have not inspected the lab since 1986, but yearly inspections are conducted by the Academy of Medical Sciences, and the W.H.O. has never allowed any work to be done with the virus at the Moscow facility anyway. The only research being done with smallpox in Russia now is the W.H.O.-sanctioned genetic sequencing of the South American \"Garcia\" strain and the \"India\" strain at the modern NPO Vector laboratory in Novosibirsk, Siberia, a former military installation that has since been converted into a private biological research company.\nMuch has also been made of the fact that the institute has no backup generators and therefore depends on the somewhat erratic central Moscow electrical grid to run the freezers. However, kept in a freeze-dried state, the virus stocks are more alive frozen and would soon lose their viability if a power failure allowed the vials to thaw. The only way the stored virus could pose a threat is if the physical integrity of the vials and of the freezers in which they're kept is somehow compromised. I asked Stephen Morse to construct a possible scenario. \"You could have a bomb go off,\" he said, \"or a mortar shell hit in such a way that the freezers open and the vials break and don't get burned themselves so that viable, slightly thawed virus comes running out and gets into the air. Then you could have a problem.\"\nAs for the oft-invoked scenario of terrorists getting hold of the stocks to use them as a weapon, scientists on both sides of the debate agree that smallpox would be a very poor and unlikely biological weapon. \"It doesn't spread that well,\" Foege said. \"All the reasons why we could eradicate it makes it bad as a biological weapon.\" Greenaway concurred: \"It wouldn't even be on the top-20 lists of terrorists weapons.\"\nStill, Morse, who said he'd like to see the virus stick around a while longer if research could be initiated right away and under the right conditions, thinks smallpox would be a rather ideal tool for terrorists. \"Maybe not in terms of numbers killed,\" he said. \"But if you consider that the point of most acts of terrorism is to frighten and demoralize people, then what better way to do that than to unleash a virus the world had thought to be eliminated.\"\nThe issue \"is something we can't turn our backs on,\" Jeffrey W. Almond told me from his office at the University of Reading, outside of London, where he is head of the School of Animal and Microbial Sciences. Almond turned a number of heads at the Glasgow round-table discussion when he announced that at a recent meeting with the British Foreign Office he'd been told that there are at least 6, and perhaps as many as 12, countries in the world still engaged in the development of biological weapons. \"In an ideal world,\" Almond told me, \"I'd argue for the preservation of smallpox for ongoing research. But as we don't live in such a place, I think this is an instance in which we need to take the moral high ground and destroy our stocks to send a very clear signal to these other countries that it's a crime against humanity to develop such weaponry.\nBefore leaving the academy that day, I asked Andzhaparidze his opinion about what we should do with smallpox. His face stiffened. \"Kill it,\" he said. \"No one has asked the populations of the world whether they want the sword of Damocles held over their head. Some scientists have just taken the right to say that we don't have to destroy it. They suffer from what's known among creative people as a crisis of genre. It means they face a dead end with their research project if we destroy the virus. All they want is funding, so they try to frighten bureacrats with awful stories about the reappearance of smallpox in the form of monkeypox and so on. The molecular biologists are far removed from the real problems of medicine and public health. To me the option is we either take care of humankind or of the virus. Molecular biologists care about viruses. Doctors care about people.\"\nIt was on my last day in Moscow that I managed to track down Svetlana Marennikova. She had left her post the year before as the head of the smallpox lab in Moscow after a falling out with Andzhaparidze -- \"I think I'm more independent than he would like,\" she said -- and now spends most of her time as a consultant to the NPO Vector lab in Siberia. She still maintains her apartment with her husband and daughter on the outskirts of Moscow, and I caught up with here there one evening an hour before she was to fly to Canada for a medical conference on pox viruses.\nA tall, handsome woman with dark hair and sad eyes, Marennikova shares a long history with variola. She has been all over the world as one of the eradication program coordinators, served as a member of the W.H.O. committees that both declared the official eradication and the plans for final destruction of the virus and now finds herself one of the lone voices for saving smallpox on the W.H.O. committee that will meet early next month.\n\"As I thought more and more,\" she told me, \"I knew we couldn't destroy this virus. It's taking us into a completely new branch of science.\"\nMarennikova told me she was out at her dacha the night of the troubles last October and that she sat frozen with fear thinking about the smallpox vials. \"Moscow is not the right place to keep this virus,\" she said. \"It's such an unstable city, and the lab has deteriorated since the W.H.O. chose to keep the stocks there. But the point is that it's just a waste to keep smallpox there now. At Novosibirsk, we have a much-better-equipped facility where researchers are already engaged in work on the virus. At the institute, they just store viruses. It's so useless. It's just dead weight awaiting the moment of destruction.\"\nMarennikova's packed suitcase lay open on the living room floor beside her. Her husband stood by the kitchen door with her coat. As we both stood up, she explained wearily that she wasn't optimistic about the chances of saving smallpox, that the debate had become \"mostly political now.\" Two of the thumbs-down votes, she said, would come from representatives of India and Brazil who pose a question that was raised by third-world countries back in 1980 when the world's remaining stocks of smallpox were divvied up between the Soviet Union and the United States: Why do only the big powers get to keep and work with the virus?\nStill, Marennikova said, she will go to Geneva in September and make her argument one last time. In a sense, she'll be asking her colleagues to make the same imaginative leap on behalf of smallpox that her countryman Viktor Zhdanov called for 30 years earlier in initiating its eradication.\n\"I cannot say with an easy heart that we should leave smallpox alive eternally,\" she said. \"But I know this is not the time to kill it. Smallpox is valuable precisely because we are its only host.\""}, {"text": "Smallpox Is Dead. Long Live Smallpox\n1994-08-21T05:00:00.000Z\nOf all the killers currently on death row in the United States, by far the most feared and closely guarded is being held, at last report, in Room 318B in the maximum-security wing at 1600 Clifton Road in Atlanta. Only a few authorized personnel have the key to Room 318B, and they rarely use it. The last civilian to gain access, a reporter for The London Times back in 1991, described only a silvery blue, chained and padlocked freezer, wrapped, for good measure, with yards of duct tape. The prisoner inside receives no visitors and hasn't seen daylight in years. Known by many names -- \"Harvey,\" \"Congo,\" \"The Great Fire,\" \"Spotted Death\" -- it is known to most of us simply as smallpox, one of the deadliest viruses of all time.\nTHE HISTORY OF SMALLPOX -- OR VARiOLA virus, as it is officially known at 1600 Clifton Road, home of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- coincides precisely with our own. Human beings are smallpox's only reservoir. Scientists believe that it first emerged more than 10,000 years ago among the earliest farming settlements of Asia and northeast Africa, and with the multiplications and movements of ancient peoples it spread madly throughout the world. Until its final capture in 1977, smallpox killed, blinded and disfigured millions, shaped the outcome of major battles, hastened the collapse of entire cultures.\nThe virus -- a minute pathogen barely visible under the most powerful microscope -- was, for much of history, identified only by its horrible effects: fiery pustules covering the face and body, profuse internal bleeding, black vomit, sloughed-off pieces of destroyed skin. One victim, a poet named Theodore Podromos living in Constantinople at the end of the 12th century, described his symptoms this way: \"First my own body is showered with hailstones from the top of the head to the nails of the toes. . . . Yes, I do justly call them hail on account of their color being white and of the shape being spherical. The body is heated violently through and through with extraordinary torches from the fever.\" The pimples \"on the seventh day become murderous pustules. Have you ever seen a violent shower of rain coming down on a lake, how the entire surface of the lake swells up on account of the closely packed bubbles? Such at this time think of my wretched flesh to have become.\"\nSmallpox's symptoms were unmistakable, but for the longest time their cause could only be ascribed to vagaries: foul air, angry deities, bad seeds in the blood. Even with the discovery of an effective vaccine in the late 18th century, superstition and poor hygiene often overrode science, allowing smallpox to thrive in various parts of the world right up until the 1970's. But now the devastation is done, the culprit caught and contained. In what is generally acknowledged to be the world's greatest public health triumph, a medical team under the supervision of the World Health Organization of the United Nations set out in 1966 for Central and West Africa, armed with smallpox vaccine and special jet injectors. It was to become history's most extensive microbe hunt, encompassing India, Nepal, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen and South America. In the end, hundreds of millions were vaccinated, and the virus was effectively severed from its life source. The last naturally occurring case of the disease was traced to Somalia, Oct. 26, 1977. We know the victim's name: Ali Maow Maalin from the town of Merka. He survived.\nNow, what are thought to be the last remnants of smallpox on the planet sit in frozen vials in Atlanta and in a freezer at the Research Institute for Viral Preparation in Moscow. A simultaneous execution of smallpox was slated for midnight, Dec. 31, 1993. Death was to be by autoclave at 248 degrees Fahrenheit for 45 minutes.\n\"Fifteen minutes in the autoclave would probably be enough,\" one C.D.C. official told me in the months before the execution. \"But we'll go 45 just to be sure. Of course, the people who actually move the virus into the autoclaves will have to be vaccinated. And there will haveto be someone from the other side to observe and sign a document verifying that the execution did take place. We'll probably record it on video as well.\"\nWorld health officials, members of the original eradication program and journalists -- myself included -- planned to be on hand to witness the first purposeful extinction of a species. The sentence was never carried out. A new execution date was to be announced by the W.H.O. at the annual World Health Assembly in May. It was declared, instead, that smallpox's fate would not be decided until May 1995. Of course, many people, a number of scientists among them, find it difficult to believe that smallpox has been kept around this long, to say nothing of the fact that we -- the hapless destroyers of far worthier earthmates -- are now considering clemency.\n\"There was a serious scientific and financial effort made by many countries to eradicate this virus,\" Otar Andzhaparidze, the keeper of smallpox in Moscow, told me in May. \"And if it ends in nothing, it would be as if a piece of music were to end before the final note was struck.\"\nBut what had seemed the obvious ending for such a long-sought adversary has since given rise to a complex debate among scientists about the possible shortsightedness of such an act. Adhering to Ovid's age-old advice that \"we can learn even from our enemies,\" many virologists and biologists now claim that through the use of today's advanced genetic and molecular research techniques, study of the smallpox virus may yield invaluable information about the inner workings and possible weaknesses of the other killer viruses, most of them still at large.\nThat we have brought something like smallpox to the brink of elimination reflects how far we as a species have advanced -- our progression from a vague, theurgically based understanding of the natural world, to a scientific and increasingly microscopic one. That we are now unable to pull the switch on smallpox merely points up the depth of mystery, promise and danger that our new microscopic focus is just beginning to expose. While the conquest of one of history's most devastating diseases would seem to betoken an increasing control over the forces that threaten us, it actually opens far more cans of microbial worms than it closes. BOOKING THE SUSPECT\nSmallpox has not only been caught and excised from the wild; it's been completely captured on paper as well. Last October, two months before the first planned execution date for the virus, I paid a visit to the Centers of Disease Control in hopes of viewing the captive. I was shown, instead, a thick black binder on an oak table in the office of Brian W. J. Mahy, the director of the division of viral and rickettsial diseases. Sitting beside Mahy was Joseph J. Esposito, who as chief of smallpox and other poxvirus infections coordinates the gene sequencing project.\n\"What you're looking at is the complete genetic code of Bangladesh 1975,\" Mahy explained. \"It's one of the more virulent strains of smallpox.\"\nI pulled it closer, centuries of suffering and urgent misguessing resolved in one black binder. It's not very compelling reading: the letters G, C, A or T -- for guanine, cytosine, adenine and thymine, the four nucleotides that make up DNA -- typed out in varying sequences, over and over, up and down the page, for hundreds of pages. But the decision to delay the destruction of smallpox has much to do with the compiling of that text, a relatively new and recently refined technology applied to the young science of virology. No one would actually see a virus in detail until 1937, the year the electron microscope was invented, and scientists are just now beginning to look inside of them to try and answer larger questions about where viruses came from, and how and why they change and continue to emerge.\nIn December 1979, when smallpox was declared officially eradicated, the last thing anyone had in mind for the perpetrator was doing research with it. Only four years ago, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Louis W. Sullivan, announced at a health organization meeting that \"there is no scientific reason not to destroy the remaining stocks of the wild virus.\" Now the end to a worldwide quest is being forestalled by the prospect of what might be found within the space of a few strands of DNA.\n\"The complete genetic code of vaccinia, the smallpox vaccine, was unraveled in 1990,\" Esposito explained, as we sat in front of Bangladesh '75 in Mahy's office and began to unravel the intricacies of the current smallpox debate. \"And here we have the code of the smallpox virus. Most of the arguments for destroying the virus preceded these two milestones. Now we're at the tip of the iceberg again. Vaccinia and smallpox are both members of the same genus. They seem to have a common ancestor. They're 98 percent the same in terms of their DNA. There are only about 13 genes that are potentially different between them, and yet one virus causes a serious disease in humans and the other doesn't. So by comparing the genes of these and other pox viruses with different virulence, we are beginning to get a notion of how they developed. There are still a great number of new insights to be gained by conducting immunological experiments in tissue cultures and mice, to try and understand how the viruses attack a host's defense system and what the Achilles' heel of smallpox is.\"\n\"The difficulty there,\" interjected Mahy, a slight Englishman with white hair, a whisper of a voice and a mind more or less made up to get on with the destruction of smallpox, \"is that to do such experiments requires very special conditions in which to grow the virus. There's been no vaccination since the late 1970's, so we have a lot of people who would be extremely susceptible if the virus was to get out. Nevertheless, there are powerful arguments on the other side, and I think it's fair to say. . . .\" Mahy paused a moment and smiled at his colleague, \"that even here at C.D.C. we have some differences of opinion about what to do with smallpox.\"\nBefore arriving at Mahy's office that afternoon, Esposito had taken me for a tour of Room 211 in Building 7, the lab in which he and his team of biologists first got the book on Bangladesh '75. The project took them more than two years to complete. Within the strange, vast landscapes of microscopia where so much of science now unfolds, smallpox is considered a large virus and therefore particularly painstaking to map. Bangladesh has 187 genes whereas the polio virus has only about 12. The genetic map of a human being, by comparison, would fill at least a million of the Bangladesh-size binders.\nRoom 211 looks like your standard laboratory: black tables and wood cabinets, racks of glass vials, rows of petri dishes, scientists in lab coats bent over microscopes. But the room's appearance betrays little of the otherworldly deeds performed there. Gene mapping is plodding, physical work done within a fleeting, invisible realm -- a topsy-turvy, through-the-looking-glass world where the DNA of a virus is said to be \"too large to handle\" and must be \"cut up\" into workable bits with \"scissorlike\" enzymes.\n\"We pluck this large chunk of DNA out of the virus,\" began Esposito, a gentle, soft-spoken man with curly, dark hair, graying at the temples and the ashen complexion of a longtime lab dweller. \"It's like taking the heart out of a virus. We use enzymes that digest all the surrounding proteins, and we use detergents to dissolve away the fats, and we're left with the DNA. Then we have to use what we call restriction enzymes that cleave the DNA at very specific places, leaving us with bits which we then put in a bacteria, inside a part called a plasmid. When the plasmid replicates, it also replicates the inserted bit of DNA, and then we use more enzymes and detergents to dissolve away the surrounding bacterial material. We keep paring it down this way until we have the DNA bit we want. We put the DNA between two sheets of glass with a jellylike substance in between, apply an electrical charge across that area and then pass it in front of a laser detector that excites the different dyes. From that, we can determine the sequence of smallpox's nearly 200,000 pairs of nucleotides. Bit by bit, this eventually gives us our telephone-book-size map of the virus.\"\nRoom 211 is designated as a biosafety level (BSL) 2 lab. In the hierarchy of precaution taken against biological threats at the C.D.C., BSL 1 and 2 are the lowest level of safety. Work is done there only with non- or moderate-risk organisms -- viruses that cause colds, for example, or bacteria that cause diarrhea. At BSL 3, work is done with organisms that cause diseases like rabies or Rocky Mountain spotted fever for which vaccines or antibiotics are available. At BSL 4, known as \"the hot zone\" or the \"blue suit lab,\" workers visit with highly transmissible viruses or with those viruses or bacteria for which there is no known cure. There are only two BSL 4 labs in the country, one at the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick in Frederick, Md., and the one in Atlanta.\nOnly the noninfectious DNA of smallpox is handled in Room 211. Room 318B, where the actual virus resides, is in a separate complex of maximum security BSL 3 and 4 labs. Esposito is one of the few people with keys to Room 318B, and neither he nor anyone else I met with in the course of my visit that day would even nod in the room's general direction. I knew, of course, that there wasn't much to see -- a room with a padlocked refrigerator -- and I suppose my desire to go there stemmed in part from themere fact that I was being told I couldn't. But somehow, after all the discussions and descriptions of smallpox and my visits to labs where people are performing what could be life-altering work and have nothing to show for it, I felt an overwhelming need to finally see some tangible evidence of the subject.\nC.D.C. officials, for their part, worry that the details of smallpox's incarceration may wind up in the hands of someone with bad intentions. There was, as well, the issue of my safety. Entering Room 318B would have required my being revaccinated. Vaccination against smallpox was terminated in this country in 1972, and doses of vaccine have since been reserved either for members of the military or for medical personnel authorized to handle smallpox and related viruses.\nOf course, there is very little chance of infection from standing next to a sealed freezer, but then odd accidents have happened. In 1978, almost a year after the last case of smallpox was diagnosed in Somalia, Janet Parker, a 40-year-old medical photographer who was working on the floor above a smallpox laboratory in Birmingham, England, contracted the disease. It has never been definitively determined how the virus reached her, but an official inquiry cited an air duct between the two floors as the most likely conduit. Unbelievably, another medical photographer working in the same room had come down with smallpox 12 years earlier.\nAs a result of Janet Parker's illness, close to 300 people who'd come in contact with her had to be quarantined. Among those, only her mother contracted smallpox; she survived. Janet Parker did not. Near the end stages of her illness, her father visited her in the hospital and soon thereafter suffered a fatal heart attack. Eight days following the initial diagnosis of her disease, Prof. Henry Bedson, the 49-year-old director of the Birmingham Laboratory, committed suicide. After the untold millions of deaths caused by smallpox, these are the last attributed to the virus. A KILLER CONTAINED\nMagnified 300,000 times under an electron microscope, the world's most mulled-over microbe looks something like a tiny biscuit of shredded wheat or like a Tater Tot. Its official name, variola, derives from the Latin \"varius\" for spotted or \"varus\" for pimple. It is a member of the orthopoxvirus family, which includes, among others, cow-, buffalo-, camel-, swine- and monkeypox. These other poxes rarely infect humans; smallpox is the exception. The freezer at the Centers for Disease Control contains approximately 500 specimens of variola in half-inch-high plastic vials. There is variola minor and variola intermedius -- the less prevalent and virulent species of smallpox -- and then there is variola major, the more predominant and deadly species of the virus, with a mortality rate as high as 40 percent. Most of the specimens in the freezer were sent from European and South American countries in the wake of the incident in Birmingham. A number of African, Middle Eastern and Asian countries sent their stocks to what was then the Soviet Union.\nRiding on airborne droplets or on the corpses and clothes of its victims, smallpox would enter the body and penetrate a cell, co-opting that cell's mechanism of replication in order to make more of itself. That is what viruses do. That is all they do. On their own, they can't reproduce or metabolize, can't grow or even move. They have no cellular casing of their own, no cytoplasm, no inner nucleus. Viruses are just loose genetic material with a coating of protein and sometimes an added layer of fats and glucose. They are renegade shards of life, of RNA or DNA -- the information for life -- without any means of applying that information. Outside of a host cell, viruses are as inert as the books containing their genetic codes. Stedman's medical dictionary describes them as \"entities on the borderline between the living and nonliving.\" They don't live so much as they wait to enter lives in order to go about mindessly making themselves, over and over, at all costs and to no higher purpose.\nSmallpox is considered a very stable virus, meaning that it can wait a long time in the wild -- for decades under certain conditions -- outside of a host cell before it dies or, insofar as it wasn't living to begin with, before it loses its viability. (Human immunodeficiencity virus, or H.I.V., in contrast, is extremely unstable and difficult to transmit. After a brief moment's exposure to the air, it will wither and dissolve.) In fact, the extreme stability of smallpox has led scientists to speculate about the possibility of the virus still existing somewhere in the wild. \"One of the more heavily investigated instances was in the 17th-century Spitalfield crypts in England, back in the 1970's,\" Mahy said. \"A modern building was being erected and it was necessary to remove a lot of lead-lined coffins found at the site. An extensive investigation was done of the liquors contained in the coffins of known smallpox victims but no infectious virus was found.\" Currently, the most likely place being considered is in the permafrost of the Siberian tundra. A team of Russian scientists recently uncovered cadavers of smallpox victims there. Tests of tissue samples did reveal smallpox antigens or proteins, but not the intact infectious virus.\nAs for the question of what a virus that thrives only within us was doing prior to us, no one can say exactly. \"We have a hint,\" Esposito said, \"that smallpox as well as cowpox and the others of the genus emerged from a common rodent ancestor, a virus whose reservoir was a rodent.\"\nWhatever its origin, smallpox is believed to have formerly been one of the harmless pox strains that infect domesticated animals. Then, through pro longed proximity to the early farmers of Africa and Asia, it made what's known in virology as a cross-species transfer, genetically mutating in such a way as to leap over and adapt to us. From Africa, it is thought to have spread to the Hittites in the 14th century B.C. and later to ancient Greece and Persia, and from the Persians to the Huns and with them into China where the disease was known as \"Hunpox.\" Alexander the Great's army was ravaged by smallpox during a campaign in India in the fourth century B.C. The mummy of the Egyptian pharaoh Ramses in the Cairo Museum shows signs of death by smallpox. In ancient Greece, the loss of faith in the sanctity of the polis and the subsequent decline of Athens is thought to have been largely the work of variola major. In his book, \"Princes and Peasants: Smallpox in History,\" Donald R. Hopkins, a member of the original eradication program in West and Central Africa, cites Thucydides' description of a devastating smallpox epidemic in 430 B.C.: \"Athens owed to the plague the beginnings of a state of unprecedented lawlessness. . . . As for the gods, it seemed to be the same thing whether one worshipped them or not when one saw the good and the bad dying indiscriminately.\"\nSmallpox ravaged Rome with a major epidemic in the second century A.D., killing the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. It spread across Europe and would continue to visit plagues upon its major cities up until the end of the 19th century. Generations of European royalty were ravaged by smallpox. In the 16th century, the disease was introduced into southern Mexico by one African slave on board the ship of the conquistador Panfilo de Narvaez and it would end up killing millions of Aztecs, Mayans and Incas, facilitating the Spanish conquest. The native peoples of North America and Canada were devastated by smallpox disseminated, at times intentionally, by settlers. In 1763, Sir Jeffrey Amherst, commander in chief of British forces in North America, ordered his troops to hand out smallpox-contaminated blankets among the Iroquois. This is the first known instance of biological warfare.\nAlthough an effective vaccine was discovered at the end of the 18th century, the disease continued to plague major cities in the United States and Canada well into the 19th century. Prior to the vaccine, people could only guess at how to combat smallpox. They tried everything from palm oil to powdered horse excrement. Bloodletting and purgatives were common treatments, but perhaps the most universal and useless therapy stemmed from the belief that the color red could promote a cure. From before the Christian era right up until the end of the 20th century, in cultures as disparate as the Japanese and the British, variola victims -- the royal and the rank and file alike -- were being wrapped in red blankets, dressed in red clothes, having their rooms fully draped in red curtains, even being exposed to the rays of special red lamps, all by way of trying to excite the blood and bring it and the malady thought to be dwelling within it to the surface.\nRemarkably, successful inoculation against smallpox was being practiced in China, India and Africa over a thousand years ago. As early as the 10th century, the Chinese were taking the dried scabs of previous smallpox victims and blowing them up the nose of healthy people to ward off the disease. In the early 1700's, a handful of attentive travelers to the Near East and Africa brought word of inoculation back to Europe and North America, where it soon became a widespread practice. Then, in 1796, a British doctor named Edward Jenner conducted some experiments based on the stories of English milkmaids who, having contracted cowpox from milking infected cows, claimed to have immunity from smallpox. He soon determined that by injecting healthy people with a closely related pox, vaccinia, they would have immunity to variola. It would be a long time, however, before vaccination was established as a uniform practice. For more than 70 years after Edward Jenner's discovery, the world was still unaware of the existence of germs or microorganisms. It was therefore quite a leap for some to accept that they could protect themselves against one dreaded disease by being injected with another that infects cows.\nBut in the long history of the battle with smallpox perhaps the most substantial leap of imagination was made back in the mid-1960's with the decision to try to eliminate the virus from the planet altogether. \"It began with a proposal by Viktor Zhdanov,\" Donald A. Henderson, the former director of the smallpox eradication program and now a senior science adviser in the Department of Health and Human Services, told me one afternoon in his Washington office. \"He was then the Vice Minister of Health for the Soviet Union. It was the first serious statement by anyone that we could even do this.\"\nNot long after a shocking outbreak of smallpox in New York City in 1947, in which more than six million residents had to be vaccinated, Henderson was apppointed head of a smallpox surveillance unit that urged the Army to develop a new vaccination device: the \"ped-o-jet,\" a foot-powered hydraulic injector that would play a major role in the eventual success of the eradication program, enabling health workers to travel widely, without recourse to electricity. Along with the ped-o-jet and a recently refined, freeze-dried vaccine that, unlike previous versions of vaccinia, retained its potency in any climate for months without refrigeration, the members of the eradication campaign also had smallpox on their side.\n\"The virus's very visible and somewhat plodding path of infection made it relatively easy to track,\" William H. Foege told me at the C.D.C. last October. Foege had been working as a medical missionary for the Lutheran Church in eastern Nigeria when the eradication program began and now works for the Carter Center in Atlanta. \"Two weeks after people came down with the disease, they were either dead or immune for life.\"\nFoege was also the architect of a new strategy called surveillance-containment: isolating areas of outbreak and then vaccinating there. This freed health workers from the burden of mass vaccination and preserved often-limited supplies of vaccine. In January 1968, a year after the start of the initial West and Central Africa campaign, a ceremony was held on a soccer field in Ghana to celebrate the 25-millionth vaccination. According to the then-director of the C.D.C., David J. Sencer, the recipient, a schoolgirl named Rebecca Ansah Asamoah, \"screamed bloody murder.\" Two and a halfyears later, the complete eradication of smallpox in all 20 of the targeted countries was confirmed.\n\"I remember when we came up with the new strategy,\" Foege recalled excitedly. \"We were sitting up, my fellow workers and I, late at night around a kerosene lantern in a little hut in Nigeria, miles from any road, deliberately trying to outthink smallpox. That's a troubling image when you consider that a virus hasn't even the semblance of a brain. And do you know what question we asked? 'What would we do, where would we go next, if we were a smallpox virus?' \"\nOf course, what Foege and the others could never have imagined, sitting up in their hut that night, is that nearly 20 years after the final capture of smallpox, the search would resume within the virus itself. THE SILENCE OF THE LABS\nAmong the people I met in Esposito's Room 211 lab that day was a research microbiologist named Janice Knight. In order to map the genetic code of smallpox, the DNA first had to be extracted from the virus. To do this, the prisoner had to be taken from the freezer in 318B and brought to the maximum security BSL 4 laboratory where it was thawed, placed in tissue culture and brought briefly back to life. This was the job of Janice Knight and her colleague Robert Massung. They have the dubious distinction of being the last people on earth to visit the live variola virus.\n\"The virus was transported in a sealed container to the maximum security unit in Building 15,\" Knight recalled matter of factly. \"I put on my scrub suit and rubber gloves, took the vial with the frozen virus and went inside the containment area just outside the lab door where I put on a full-body pressurized space suit. I zipped it up and then passed through the air-lock doors with the vial of smallpox into the BSL 4 lab.\"\nLike Room 318B, the BSL 4 lab is normally off limits to someone like myself, but it just happened to be in a washdown stage between projects the day I was there and so later that afternoon I was allowed access. Upon entering the antechamber outside the lab's double air-lock entrance doors, I saw a row of the blue plastic \"space suits\" Janice Knight had spoken of, hanging from a set of wall hooks. They look like outsize feet pajamas with bright yellow rubber gloves attached at the wrists, clear visor hoods and metal air-valve attachments jutting from the side.\n\"You don't have much feeling in your hands, because of the gloves over other gloves,\" Knight said. \"You have to move very slowly so you don't knock things over.\"\nInside the main lab room, coiled red air hoses dangle every few feet or so from the ceiling. A worker moving from station to station or room to room detaches from one hose and hooks up to the next. There's enough air in the suit to go two or three minutes without hooking up to another hose. Air pressure within the lab's rooms decreases the farther you move toward the center of the building, so that all air flows inward and then up through a special filtration system. The floor above and the one below the BSL 4 lab are entirely devoted to maintaining and purging its environment. Upstairs, there are banks of HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filters designed to trap the most minute particles flowing in and out of the lab. Downstairs, there are rows of backup air-supply tanks, a huge diesel back-up generator and two 1,000-gallon tanks for heating and decontaminating liquid waste before it's cooled and released into the public sewer system.\n\"Once inside the lab in the suit, you're pretty much isolated,\" Knight said. \"It's just you and your air hose. It's a bit like scuba diving.\"\nWhite-tiled, air-locked, soundless, the lab rooms did seem to be deep under water. The light inside was flashbulb bright, exposing every flat surface and corner. A four-foot-high, square liquid nitrogen freezer for storing vials was set against one wall with the lid open. There was a set of glass-enclosed work tables known as \"laminar-flow biosafety cabinets.\" They, too, have negative air pressure and just an 8-inch-wide opening in front for workers to stick their hands through and work with their \"hot agents.\"\n\"I thawed the virus,\" Janice Knight went on, \"and then grew it up on human tissue. We have established cell lines from human tissue, immortal cell lines. It's considered immortal because you can keep splitting the cells and passing them along forever.\"\nAfter variola sprang to life and began replicating, Knight extracted the DNA and placed it in a solution of phenol. All solid waste material from the workday goes to the innermost BSL 4 room, where there some trash bins with bright red biohazard symbols on them and two autoclaves built into the back wall. All workers exit BSL 4 through a set of double-air-lock doors, the space between which also serves as a chemical shower. A worker hooks up to a red air hose and must stand for a minimum of four minutes under a steady spray of Lysol.\n\"I had the DNA in a one-and-a-half-milliliter epindorph centrifuge tube,\" Knight said. \"I carried it out by hand. The exterior of the tube had been washed in Clorox and then put inside another sterile tube within a sterile hood, and all that was brought with me through the Lysol shower so there was no way any virus was coming out with me.\"\nIt all might sound a bit extreme until you hear about the other kinds of creatures handled in BSL 4. There's the group of tick-borne encephalitis viruses, for example, or the Muerto Canyon hantavirus that last summer killed 27 people in the Southwest. A previously unknown and far more virulent relative of the hantavirus that originated in Korea and China, Muerto Canyon was first identified in the BSL 4 lab less than three weeks after its sudden and mysterious emergence. There have since been isolated cases across the United States, from California to New York. The virus causes influenzalike symptoms for the first few days and then leads to pulmonary edema. The lungs fill with bloody fluid and victims literally drown in themselves.\nThe hemorraghic fever viruses are held in BSL 4: Marburg, Lassa, Junin, Machupo, Congo-Crimean and Ebola -- both Ebola Sudan and one of the deadliest human viruses ever known, Ebola Zaire. Classified as a filovirus because of it's gnarled, threadlike appearance, Ebola Zaire made a sudden, memorable debut back in 1976 when it struck 55 villages near the river for which it's named. The virus bedevils the blood, causing it to simultaneously clot and thin. Clots lodge throughout the body, inducing internal hemorrhaging. As the disease advances, virus-ridden blood streams from the mouth, nose, anus and up through the skin, rendering it the consistency of rotting fruit. The virus seems to spread this way, on rivulets of its victims' escaping blood. Ebola killed nearly 90 percent of those it infected. Only AIDS and rabies have higher death rates. SECRETS OF A PATHOGEN\nI was pleased to leave BSL 4 that day, to get away even from the ghosts of such beings. I remember walking the grounds around the C.D.C. complex the following morning. Directly across the road from the BSL 4 lab, which is both earthquake- and tornado-proof and looks from the outside like some post-modern military bunker, is a day-care center for children. It was a bright, cloudless day and I could hear on the wind the sound of the children playing somewhere out back. This is where we are now in the world, I thought: advanced to the point where we can label and keep previously unknowable threats insidehuge buildings within a normal day and yet remain as oblivious and vulnerable as ever to those threats.\nOne of the defining conceits of modernity is that we have dispensed with plagues, that we are rapidly rendering the world as harmless and sterile as a suburban kitchen counter top. The spread of AIDS has by now disabused many of us of such a notion. And yet our mind-set about the natural world still seems to be stuck midway between the old assumptions of our singularity and supremacy and the plain biological reality that new viruses like Ebola continue to point up to us: that we are but one of many competing species on the planet and will be long outlived by organisms like viruses.\nAs they have already done with smallpox, scientists have begun to identify the viral genus or family to which H.I.V. belongs. One close cousin was discovered a few years after H.I.V. and is now designated as H.I.V.-2. It is endemic to the western coast of sub-Saharan Africa, is barely present in those parts of Africa where H.I.V. is rampant and causes far milder symptoms, allowing victims to live longer than victims with H.I.V. Another relative is simian immunodeficiency virus, or S.I.V., which is nearly identical genetically to H.I.V.-2 and, as near as anyone can tell, has been infecting, though not killing, an African monkey known as the sooty mangabey for thousands of years. Scientists believe that H.I.V. began as a simian immunodeficiency virus and, just as smallpox is thought to have done thousands of years ago, made one of those cross-species leaps to humans. Muerto Canyon hantavirus and the hemorrhagic fevers are thought to have reached us by similar means. Whatever the origin of viruses might be, and however peripheral and inert their existence may seem, they apparently have no trouble keeping up with us.\nThere have been, along with the conquest of smallpox, some other notable advances made against killer pathogens. The W.H.O. has set a target date of late 1995 for the eradication of dracunculiasis, or Guinea worm, a particularly nasty, water-borne organism that bores through the skin of the feet and grows into a long stringy worm that eats away at the connective tissue of the legs and trunk and can only be drawn back out by winding it slowly around a stick. Polio has been slated by the W.H.O. for complete eradication by the year 2000 and measles, which still kills over two and a half million children a year, for some time shortly thereafter. In fact, one of the reasons that so much attention is being paid to the decision made about smallpox is that both advocates and opponents of the destruction see the final outcome of this case as establishing a precedent.\n\"It's a symbolic thing,\" Mahy told me in his office that afternoon. \"It says that mankind is not afraid of eliminating potential dangers.\"\nStill, these are somewhat hollow victories. Like smallpox, what polio and measles have in common is us. Human beings are their only reservoir, and this makes them easier to isolate and attack. As for Ebola Zaire, Muerto Canyon and the others, they are known as \"emerging viruses.\" The term is a bit misleading in that such viruses have been around for ages. It's just that we are now interrupting them and commingling with them more often, especially as civilization continues to advance upon previously undeveloped environments, like rain forests, where the majority of these \"emerging\" viruses wait. The threat of a catastrophic outbreak is never more than a jet flight away.\nThe presence of these new threats would seem to render a retired death-row prisoner like smallpox an afterthought. \"In simple economic terms,\" Mahy said, \"many ask whether we really want to start funding research on a virus we've eradicated when we have so many new diseases like Ebola and the new hantavirus to deal with?\"\nBut to those hoping for another stay of execution, emerging viruses are precisely why something like smallpox should be kept around. To Esposito and scores of others, smallpox is the viral equivalent of a Hannibal Lecter, capable of enlightening those who dare to visit with it, of shedding insight on the methods of other serial-killer viruses.\nOne suspect that virologists are keeping an eye on is an old cousin of variola, monkeypox. The virus was first discovered in the monkeys of Zaire but its actual reservoir has since been determined to be squirrels. For reasons still unclear, this particular pox virus is not readily transmitted to or among people. Only some 300 cases have been recorded, and no single outbreak has spread beyond five people. But many worry about monkeypox making the necessary and not unlikely cross-species mutations that would allow it to, as Esposito puts it, \"fill the niche that we voided by vaccinating the world against smallpox.\"\n\"How would we deal with that?\" Esposito asked. \"Vaccinia would be the normal countermeasure, but in Zaire, where there is such a high rate of AIDS, you can't prescribe smallpox vaccine because people with an immunodeficency would die from the vaccine. It presents one with a very odd ethical problem. Do you kill people trying to save them from monkeypox or let them die from either it or AIDS? Or could we find another strategy? By holding on to the actual smallpox virus and conducting experiments, we've already begun to learn how smallpox works.\" What has Esposito and others in the field most intrigued is the discovery of previously unknown viral proteins that smallpox produces. These proteins block the host cell's natural ability to stave off infection. A better understanding of how this happens, Esposito said, might one day help scientists devise a means of combatting viruses without relying on vaccines -- a strategy that could instead stop the production of the proteins, or even employ them to some curative end.\n\"It is unbelieveable to me that people would want to destroy this virus now,\" said Wolfgang K. Joklik, former chairman of the department of microbiology and immunology at Duke University, in a recent phone conversation. \"We just discovered the smallpox protein that tells the cell to shut down when invaded by a virus. This is how smallpox gets the cell to manufacture more smallpox. Now this is a gene we knew nothing about a year ago, and there are a hundred more of them. It seems absolutely ridiculous to me to throw them away, especially when we have something like AIDS, which we're nowhere near being able to stop and will infect hundreds of millions of people. By using smallpox to find out more about the components of the human defense mechanism, we might be able to determine which of the cell's components the AIDS virus interacts with and overcomes.\"\nIn fact, a number of virologists have noted that the eradication of smallpox in Africa and the rise of AIDS were coincidental, and it has been suggested that there may be a causal relationship there as well. Hundreds of millions of people were vaccinated, and the speculation is that AIDS may have been sparked either through the repeated use of H.I.V.-contaminated ped-o-jet lancets or via a phenomenon known as co-infection in which the injected vaccinia virus somehow activates a latent H.I.V. infection. There is no way to verify such a theory, but if it is true, and if what we were to learn from smallpox could help us in some way in the fight against a virus like H.I.V., then the story of the ancient scourge that is variola will have truly come full circle.\n\"I will go along with what the W.H.O. decides,\" Esposito told me before I left the C.D.C. that afternoon. \"But in my view, we need the whole intact virus and its gene products, the virus proteins, in order to learn. We just don't know enough about viruses or the human defense system to say that we don't. To me it's a matter of preparedness for the future.\" AWAITING THE VERDICT\nIn just over two weeks, the Ad Hoc Committee on Orthopox Virus Infections will be meeting in Room E110 at the W.H.O. headquarters in Geneva to make its final recommendation on the fate of variola. The decision will be passed along to the W.H.O.'s executive board, whose members will meet next January and then pass along the minutes of that meeting along with their recommendation to all 187 member countries of the W.H.O. After an open discussion among the representatives of those countries at the annual World Health Assembly, a final decision will be announced.\nFrom all early indications, things don't look good for smallpox. Of the 11 doctors on the committee meeting this Sept. 9 in Geneva, it appears that at least 9 of them will vote to destroy. When I brought up the matter with Peter Greenaway, of the Department of Health in London, at a meeting in Geneva in January, he seemed decidedly impatient with the whole business. \"Biological species have been disappearing for thousands of years,\" he told me. \"Are we really worrying about one particularly nasty virus?\"\nAt bottom, those who favor destroying smallpox do so not out of hubris but out of a carefully weighed concern that the killer virus might somehow escape and wreak havoc on a nonvaccinated world. Henderson, who as head of the eradication program would have as much right as anyone to bear a personal vendetta against smallpox, says: \"I've thought about it a lot and I feel we can get all we need from variola's relatives without the risk of keeping the one strain that's harmful to us. So I think we should destroy.\"\nThose who favor saving smallpox think the dire escape scenarios are greatly exaggerated and they note that scientists would know how to control an outbreak. \"If it did happen to get out,\" Joklik added, \"and a few people were to get sick, that would be a terrible thing. But why are we so caught up in the age of the individual? Why can't we see down the road and understand how many lives we might save with what we learn from this virus?\"\nIt's difficult to know whether the opinions of the Geneva committee accurately reflect those of scientists at large. But if a round-table discussion on the subject in Glasgow, Scotland, last August is any indication, the answer is no. Of the more than 500 virologists, biologists and microbiologists from around the world who participated, at least half argued for preserving smallpox.\nParadoxically, those calling for destruction also invoke the new gene sequencing technology now to bolster their argument. They assert that with the genetic maps and DNA clones of smallpox on hand, we have all that's required for future research -- even the ability to reassemble smallpox from the separate pieces of DNA. The problem there, said Stephen S. Morse, a virologist at Rockefeller University, is that we can't be sure the reassembled smallpox will be exactly the same as the original and create the same effects within the host cell as the natural variola virus.\nIn essence, the wide-ranging debate about smallpox comes down to how much one believes in the riches that might be mined from one-millionth of a micron. This is the space in which most new scientific discoveries are being made these days, and it seems now, as with the supercollider and the space program, that the continued pursuit of smallpox depends on our willingness to fund the exploration of potential dead ends.\nBut for now, at least, it appears that more immediate worldly concerns will preclude our making any otherworldly advances with smallpox. \"I was absolutely against destroying the virus a few years ago,\" Yuri Z. Ghendon, a top health official at the W.H.O. and the former director of the department of general virology at the Moscow Research Institute, told me in Geneva in January. \"I fought with all the committee members who wanted to eradicate, telling them that if we keep the virus in safe conditions, nothing will happen. But with all the incidents of late, the terrorists' bombings of the World Trade Towers in New York, bombings in London and Italy, I have changed my view. Now, when we discuss this smallpox matter so widely, how do you know terrorists won't read this and go to the C.D.C. with a bomb? And look at the situation with the political uprising in Moscow last October. What if a fire had been set to the Research Institute where we store the virus? The institute is not like the C.D.C. It's a very old building.\" BEHIND CORRODING BARS\nI flew to Moscow in May in one last attempt to view variola in captivity. My chances appeared good at the outset. I'd arranged to meet with the lab director, Otar Andzhaparidze, who agreed to give me a tour of the Research Institute. But a series of articles in the Moscow newspapers criticizing the poor conditions and lack of security at the lab had left Andzhaparidze feeling less than kindly toward reporters.\nWe met in a vast empty conference room on the second floor of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences -- one of downtown Moscow's many crumbling, pale yellow, 19th-century buildings. The bottle of expensive Scotch I'd bought as a last-ditch offering was set on the table between us. Andzhaparidze regarded it with a slow stroke of his aged, jowly, Georgian chins, put the bottle in his black briefcase and then handed me in return a stack of official documents that he said would explain the present position of the Russian Government about the keeping of smallpox. \"Not such a good trade for you,\" he said, laughing.\nOver the next few minutes I tried in various ways to bring up the subject of my lab tour and then the doctor finally laid down the law. \"Some of the articles written,\" he began, \"can be regarded as direct methodical directions for all kinds of criminals and terrorists to come in and find the virus. When I saw this, I decided to defend ourselves and deprive correspondents the pleasure of writing nasty things.\"\nThe following afternoon I took a cab out to the Research Institute to have a look around on my own. It's a drab yellow, four-story brick building on the industrial southeastern edge of the city. There's a bent iron-spoked fence running around it, topped with barbed wire, and a small brick guardhouse out by the front gate through which all workers and deliveries come and go. Looking in, I could see white-smocked women wheeling bins of medical waste to a large receptacle under a tin shed out back.\nSmallpox is said to be up in a fourth-floor lab at the end of a long, dark hallway in a pair of ordinary-looking kitchen freezers that are set behind a pair of glass doors, locked and wired with special alarms to summon Moscow police from a nearby station in the event of an attempted break-in. The lab does have someone on duty around the clock to watch the place, but there are no armed guards or private security personnel as there are at the C.D.C. -- although Andzhaparidze did say that on the night of the October rebellion he'd hired members of an independent security group armed with tear-gas pistols.\n\"The atmosphere was alarming,\" he recalled. \"But everything worked out. We've been keeping the virus for about 30 years and so far God has spared us.\"\nI felt a bit silly standing outside the Research Institute that day, having flown half way across the world just to stare up from a sooty sidewalk in the vague direction of the other side's smallpox. I wondered if the dilapidation of the institute and of the country around it would ultimately determine the fate of variola. In a sense, the building's crumbling superstructure is incidental to the issue of smallpox's security. W.H.O. officials have not inspected the lab since 1986, but yearly inspections are conducted by the Academy of Medical Sciences, and the W.H.O. has never allowed any work to be done with the virus at the Moscow facility anyway. The only research being done with smallpox in Russia now is the W.H.O.-sanctioned genetic sequencing of the South American \"Garcia\" strain and the \"India\" strain at the modern NPO Vector laboratory in Novosibirsk, Siberia, a former military installation that has since been converted into a private biological research company.\nMuch has also been made of the fact that the institute has no backup generators and therefore depends on the somewhat erratic central Moscow electrical grid to run the freezers. However, kept in a freeze-dried state, the virus stocks are more alive frozen and would soon lose their viability if a power failure allowed the vials to thaw. The only way the stored virus could pose a threat is if the physical integrity of the vials and of the freezers in which they're kept is somehow compromised. I asked Stephen Morse to construct a possible scenario. \"You could have a bomb go off,\" he said, \"or a mortar shell hit in such a way that the freezers open and the vials break and don't get burned themselves so that viable, slightly thawed virus comes running out and gets into the air. Then you could have a problem.\"\nAs for the oft-invoked scenario of terrorists getting hold of the stocks to use them as a weapon, scientists on both sides of the debate agree that smallpox would be a very poor and unlikely biological weapon. \"It doesn't spread that well,\" Foege said. \"All the reasons why we could eradicate it makes it bad as a biological weapon.\" Greenaway concurred: \"It wouldn't even be on the top-20 lists of terrorists weapons.\"\nStill, Morse, who said he'd like to see the virus stick around a while longer if research could be initiated right away and under the right conditions, thinks smallpox would be a rather ideal tool for terrorists. \"Maybe not in terms of numbers killed,\" he said. \"But if you consider that the point of most acts of terrorism is to frighten and demoralize people, then what better way to do that than to unleash a virus the world had thought to be eliminated.\"\nThe issue \"is something we can't turn our backs on,\" Jeffrey W. Almond told me from his office at the University of Reading, outside of London, where he is head of the School of Animal and Microbial Sciences. Almond turned a number of heads at the Glasgow round-table discussion when he announced that at a recent meeting with the British Foreign Office he'd been told that there are at least 6, and perhaps as many as 12, countries in the world still engaged in the development of biological weapons. \"In an ideal world,\" Almond told me, \"I'd argue for the preservation of smallpox for ongoing research. But as we don't live in such a place, I think this is an instance in which we need to take the moral high ground and destroy our stocks to send a very clear signal to these other countries that it's a crime against humanity to develop such weaponry.\nBefore leaving the academy that day, I asked Andzhaparidze his opinion about what we should do with smallpox. His face stiffened. \"Kill it,\" he said. \"No one has asked the populations of the world whether they want the sword of Damocles held over their head. Some scientists have just taken the right to say that we don't have to destroy it. They suffer from what's known among creative people as a crisis of genre. It means they face a dead end with their research project if we destroy the virus. All they want is funding, so they try to frighten bureacrats with awful stories about the reappearance of smallpox in the form of monkeypox and so on. The molecular biologists are far removed from the real problems of medicine and public health. To me the option is we either take care of humankind or of the virus. Molecular biologists care about viruses. Doctors care about people.\"\nIt was on my last day in Moscow that I managed to track down Svetlana Marennikova. She had left her post the year before as the head of the smallpox lab in Moscow after a falling out with Andzhaparidze -- \"I think I'm more independent than he would like,\" she said -- and now spends most of her time as a consultant to the NPO Vector lab in Siberia. She still maintains her apartment with her husband and daughter on the outskirts of Moscow, and I caught up with here there one evening an hour before she was to fly to Canada for a medical conference on pox viruses.\nA tall, handsome woman with dark hair and sad eyes, Marennikova shares a long history with variola. She has been all over the world as one of the eradication program coordinators, served as a member of the W.H.O. committees that both declared the official eradication and the plans for final destruction of the virus and now finds herself one of the lone voices for saving smallpox on the W.H.O. committee that will meet early next month.\n\"As I thought more and more,\" she told me, \"I knew we couldn't destroy this virus. It's taking us into a completely new branch of science.\"\nMarennikova told me she was out at her dacha the night of the troubles last October and that she sat frozen with fear thinking about the smallpox vials. \"Moscow is not the right place to keep this virus,\" she said. \"It's such an unstable city, and the lab has deteriorated since the W.H.O. chose to keep the stocks there. But the point is that it's just a waste to keep smallpox there now. At Novosibirsk, we have a much-better-equipped facility where researchers are already engaged in work on the virus. At the institute, they just store viruses. It's so useless. It's just dead weight awaiting the moment of destruction.\"\nMarennikova's packed suitcase lay open on the living room floor beside her. Her husband stood by the kitchen door with her coat. As we both stood up, she explained wearily that she wasn't optimistic about the chances of saving smallpox, that the debate had become \"mostly political now.\" Two of the thumbs-down votes, she said, would come from representatives of India and Brazil who pose a question that was raised by third-world countries back in 1980 when the world's remaining stocks of smallpox were divvied up between the Soviet Union and the United States: Why do only the big powers get to keep and work with the virus?\nStill, Marennikova said, she will go to Geneva in September and make her argument one last time. In a sense, she'll be asking her colleagues to make the same imaginative leap on behalf of smallpox that her countryman Viktor Zhdanov called for 30 years earlier in initiating its eradication.\n\"I cannot say with an easy heart that we should leave smallpox alive eternally,\" she said. \"But I know this is not the time to kill it. Smallpox is valuable precisely because we are its only host.\""}, {"text": "Smallpox Is Dead. Long Live Smallpox.\n1994-08-21T05:00:00.000Z\nOf all the killers currently on death row in the United States, by far the most feared and closely guarded is being held, at last report, in Room 318B in the maximum-security wing at 1600 Clifton Road in Atlanta. Only a few authorized personnel have the key to Room 318B, and they rarely use it. The last civilian to gain access, a reporter for The London Times back in 1991, described only a silvery blue, chained and padlocked freezer, wrapped, for good measure, with yards of duct tape. The prisoner inside receives no visitors and hasn't seen daylight in years. Known by many names -- \"Harvey,\" \"Congo,\" \"The Great Fire,\" \"Spotted Death\" -- it is known to most of us simply as smallpox, one of the deadliest viruses of all time.\nTHE HISTORY OF SMALLPOX -- OR VARiOLA virus, as it is officially known at 1600 Clifton Road, home of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- coincides precisely with our own. Human beings are smallpox's only reservoir. Scientists believe that it first emerged more than 10,000 years ago among the earliest farming settlements of Asia and northeast Africa, and with the multiplications and movements of ancient peoples it spread madly throughout the world. Until its final capture in 1977, smallpox killed, blinded and disfigured millions, shaped the outcome of major battles, hastened the collapse of entire cultures.\nThe virus -- a minute pathogen barely visible under the most powerful microscope -- was, for much of history, identified only by its horrible effects: fiery pustules covering the face and body, profuse internal bleeding, black vomit, sloughed-off pieces of destroyed skin. One victim, a poet named Theodore Podromos living in Constantinople at the end of the 12th century, described his symptoms this way: \"First my own body is showered with hailstones from the top of the head to the nails of the toes. . . . Yes, I do justly call them hail on account of their color being white and of the shape being spherical. The body is heated violently through and through with extraordinary torches from the fever.\" The pimples \"on the seventh day become murderous pustules. Have you ever seen a violent shower of rain coming down on a lake, how the entire surface of the lake swells up on account of the closely packed bubbles? Such at this time think of my wretched flesh to have become.\" \nSmallpox's symptoms were unmistakable, but for the longest time their cause could only be ascribed to vagaries: foul air, angry deities, bad seeds in the blood. Even with the discovery of an effective vaccine in the late 18th century, superstition and poor hygiene often overrode science, allowing smallpox to thrive in various parts of the world right up until the 1970's. But now the devastation is done, the culprit caught and contained. In what is generally acknowledged to be the world's greatest public health triumph, a medical team under the supervision of the World Health Organization of the United Nations set out in 1966 for Central and West Africa, armed with smallpox vaccine and special jet injectors. It was to become history's most extensive microbe hunt, encompassing India, Nepal, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen and South America. In the end, hundreds of millions were vaccinated, and the virus was effectively severed from its life source. The last naturally occurring case of the disease was traced to Somalia, Oct. 26, 1977. We know the victim's name: Ali Maow Maalin from the town of Merka. He survived.\nNow, what are thought to be the last remnants of smallpox on the planet sit in frozen vials in Atlanta and in a freezer at the Research Institute for Viral Preparation in Moscow. A simultaneous execution of smallpox was slated for midnight, Dec. 31, 1993. Death was to be by autoclave at 248 degrees Fahrenheit for 45 minutes.\n\"Fifteen minutes in the autoclave would probably be enough,\" one C.D.C. official told me in the months before the execution. \"But we'll go 45 just to be sure. Of course, the people who actually move the virus into the autoclaves will have to be vaccinated. And there will haveto be someone from the other side to observe and sign a document verifying that the execution did take place. We'll probably record it on video as well.\"\nWorld health officials, members of the original eradication program and journalists -- myself included -- planned to be on hand to witness the first purposeful extinction of a species. The sentence was never carried out. A new execution date was to be announced by the W.H.O. at the annual World Health Assembly in May. It was declared, instead, that smallpox's fate would not be decided until May 1995. Of course, many people, a number of scientists among them, find it difficult to believe that smallpox has been kept around this long, to say nothing of the fact that we -- the hapless destroyers of far worthier earthmates -- are now considering clemency.\n\"There was a serious scientific and financial effort made by many countries to eradicate this virus,\" Otar Andzhaparidze, the keeper of smallpox in Moscow, told me in May. \"And if it ends in nothing, it would be as if a piece of music were to end before the final note was struck.\"\nBut what had seemed the obvious ending for such a long-sought adversary has since given rise to a complex debate among scientists about the possible shortsightedness of such an act. Adhering to Ovid's age-old advice that \"we can learn even from our enemies,\" many virologists and biologists now claim that through the use of today's advanced genetic and molecular research techniques, study of the smallpox virus may yield invaluable information about the inner workings and possible weaknesses of the other killer viruses, most of them still at large.\nThat we have brought something like smallpox to the brink of elimination reflects how far we as a species have advanced -- our progression from a vague, theurgically based understanding of the natural world, to a scientific and increasingly microscopic one. That we are now unable to pull the switch on smallpox merely points up the depth of mystery, promise and danger that our new microscopic focus is just beginning to expose. While the conquest of one of history's most devastating diseases would seem to betoken an increasing control over the forces that threaten us, it actually opens far more cans of microbial worms than it closes.BOOKING THE SUSPECT\nSmallpox has not only been caught and excised from the wild; it's been completely captured on paper as well. Last October, two months before the first planned execution date for the virus, I paid a visit to the Centers of Disease Control in hopes of viewing the captive. I was shown, instead, a thick black binder on an oak table in the office of Brian W. J. Mahy, the director of the division of viral and rickettsial diseases. Sitting beside Mahy was Joseph J. Esposito, who as chief of smallpox and other poxvirus infections coordinates the gene sequencing project.\n\"What you're looking at is the complete genetic code of Bangladesh 1975,\" Mahy explained. \"It's one of the more virulent strains of smallpox.\"\nI pulled it closer, centuries of suffering and urgent misguessing resolved in one black binder. It's not very compelling reading: the letters G, C, A or T -- for guanine, cytosine, adenine and thymine, the four nucleotides that make up DNA -- typed out in varying sequences, over and over, up and down the page, for hundreds of pages. But the decision to delay the destruction of smallpox has much to do with the compiling of that text, a relatively new and recently refined technology applied to the young science of virology. No one would actually see a virus in detail until 1937, the year the electron microscope was invented, and scientists are just now beginning to look inside of them to try and answer larger questions about where viruses came from, and how and why they change and continue to emerge. \nIn December 1979, when smallpox was declared officially eradicated, the last thing anyone had in mind for the perpetrator was doing research with it. Only four years ago, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Louis W. Sullivan, announced at a health organization meeting that \"there is no scientific reason not to destroy the remaining stocks of the wild virus.\" Now the end to a worldwide quest is being forestalled by the prospect of what might be found within the space of a few strands of DNA.\n\"The complete genetic code of vaccinia, the smallpox vaccine, was unraveled in 1990,\" Esposito explained, as we sat in front of Bangladesh '75 in Mahy's office and began to unravel the intricacies of the current smallpox debate. \"And here we have the code of the smallpox virus. Most of the arguments for destroying the virus preceded these two milestones. Now we're at the tip of the iceberg again. Vaccinia and smallpox are both members of the same genus. They seem to have a common ancestor. They're 98 percent the same in terms of their DNA. There are only about 13 genes that are potentially different between them, and yet one virus causes a serious disease in humans and the other doesn't. So by comparing the genes of these and other pox viruses with different virulence, we are beginning to get a notion of how they developed. There are still a great number of new insights to be gained by conducting immunological experiments in tissue cultures and mice, to try and understand how the viruses attack a host's defense system and what the Achilles' heel of smallpox is.\"\n\"The difficulty there,\" interjected Mahy, a slight Englishman with white hair, a whisper of a voice and a mind more or less made up to get on with the destruction of smallpox, \"is that to do such experiments requires very special conditions in which to grow the virus. There's been no vaccination since the late 1970's, so we have a lot of people who would be extremely susceptible if the virus was to get out. Nevertheless, there are powerful arguments on the other side, and I think it's fair to say. . . .\" Mahy paused a moment and smiled at his colleague, \"that even here at C.D.C. we have some differences of opinion about what to do with smallpox.\"\nBefore arriving at Mahy's office that afternoon, Esposito had taken me for a tour of Room 211 in Building 7, the lab in which he and his team of biologists first got the book on Bangladesh '75. The project took them more than two years to complete. Within the strange, vast landscapes of microscopia where so much of science now unfolds, smallpox is considered a large virus and therefore particularly painstaking to map. Bangladesh has 187 genes whereas the polio virus has only about 12. The genetic map of a human being, by comparison, would fill at least a million of the Bangladesh-size binders.\nRoom 211 looks like your standard laboratory: black tables and wood cabinets, racks of glass vials, rows of petri dishes, scientists in lab coats bent over microscopes. But the room's appearance betrays little of the otherworldly deeds performed there. Gene mapping is plodding, physical work done within a fleeting, invisible realm -- a topsy-turvy, through-the-looking-glass world where the DNA of a virus is said to be \"too large to handle\" and must be \"cut up\" into workable bits with \"scissorlike\" enzymes.\n\"We pluck this large chunk of DNA out of the virus,\" began Esposito, a gentle, soft-spoken man with curly, dark hair, graying at the temples and the ashen complexion of a longtime lab dweller. \"It's like taking the heart out of a virus. We use enzymes that digest all the surrounding proteins, and we use detergents to dissolve away the fats, and we're left with the DNA. Then we have to use what we call restriction enzymes that cleave the DNA at very specific places, leaving us with bits which we then put in a bacteria, inside a part called a plasmid. When the plasmid replicates, it also replicates the inserted bit of DNA, and then we use more enzymes and detergents to dissolve away the surrounding bacterial material. We keep paring it down this way until we have the DNA bit we want. We put the DNA between two sheets of glass with a jellylike substance in between, apply an electrical charge across that area and then pass it in front of a laser detector that excites the different dyes. From that, we can determine the sequence of smallpox's nearly 200,000 pairs of nucleotides. Bit by bit, this eventually gives us our telephone-book-size map of the virus.\"\nRoom 211 is designated as a biosafety level (BSL) 2 lab. In the hierarchy of precaution taken against biological threats at the C.D.C., BSL 1 and 2 are the lowest level of safety. Work is done there only with non- or moderate-risk organisms -- viruses that cause colds, for example, or bacteria that cause diarrhea. At BSL 3, work is done with organisms that cause diseases like rabies or Rocky Mountain spotted fever for which vaccines or antibiotics are available. At BSL 4, known as \"the hot zone\" or the \"blue suit lab,\" workers visit with highly transmissible viruses or with those viruses or bacteria for which there is no known cure. There are only two BSL 4 labs in the country, one at the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick in Frederick, Md., and the one in Atlanta.\nOnly the noninfectious DNA of smallpox is handled in Room 211. Room 318B, where the actual virus resides, is in a separate complex of maximum security BSL 3 and 4 labs. Esposito is one of the few people with keys to Room 318B, and neither he nor anyone else I met with in the course of my visit that day would even nod in the room's general direction. I knew, of course, that there wasn't much to see -- a room with a padlocked refrigerator -- and I suppose my desire to go there stemmed in part from themere fact that I was being told I couldn't. But somehow, after all the discussions and descriptions of smallpox and my visits to labs where people are performing what could be life-altering work and have nothing to show for it, I felt an overwhelming need to finally see some tangible evidence of the subject.\nC.D.C. officials, for their part, worry that the details of smallpox's incarceration may wind up in the hands of someone with bad intentions. There was, as well, the issue of my safety. Entering Room 318B would have required my being revaccinated. Vaccination against smallpox was terminated in this country in 1972, and doses of vaccine have since been reserved either for members of the military or for medical personnel authorized to handle smallpox and related viruses.\nOf course, there is very little chance of infection from standing next to a sealed freezer, but then odd accidents have happened. In 1978, almost a year after the last case of smallpox was diagnosed in Somalia, Janet Parker, a 40-year-old medical photographer who was working on the floor above a smallpox laboratory in Birmingham, England, contracted the disease. It has never been definitively determined how the virus reached her, but an official inquiry cited an air duct between the two floors as the most likely conduit. Unbelievably, another medical photographer working in the same room had come down with smallpox 12 years earlier.\nAs a result of Janet Parker's illness, close to 300 people who'd come in contact with her had to be quarantined. Among those, only her mother contracted smallpox; she survived. Janet Parker did not. Near the end stages of her illness, her father visited her in the hospital and soon thereafter suffered a fatal heart attack. Eight days following the initial diagnosis of her disease, Prof. Henry Bedson, the 49-year-old director of the Birmingham Laboratory, committed suicide. After the untold millions of deaths caused by smallpox, these are the last attributed to the virus.A KILLER CONTAINED\nMagnified 300,000 times under an electron microscope, the world's most mulled-over microbe looks something like a tiny biscuit of shredded wheat or like a Tater Tot. Its official name, variola, derives from the Latin \"varius\" for spotted or \"varus\" for pimple. It is a member of the orthopoxvirus family, which includes, among others, cow-, buffalo-, camel-, swine- and monkeypox. These other poxes rarely infect humans; smallpox is the exception. The freezer at the Centers for Disease Control contains approximately 500 specimens of variola in half-inch-high plastic vials. There is variola minor and variola intermedius -- the less prevalent and virulent species of smallpox -- and then there is variola major, the more predominant and deadly species of the virus, with a mortality rate as high as 40 percent. Most of the specimens in the freezer were sent from European and South American countries in the wake of the incident in Birmingham. A number of African, Middle Eastern and Asian countries sent their stocks to what was then the Soviet Union. \nRiding on airborne droplets or on the corpses and clothes of its victims, smallpox would enter the body and penetrate a cell, co-opting that cell's mechanism of replication in order to make more of itself. That is what viruses do. That is all they do. On their own, they can't reproduce or metabolize, can't grow or even move. They have no cellular casing of their own, no cytoplasm, no inner nucleus. Viruses are just loose genetic material with a coating of protein and sometimes an added layer of fats and glucose. They are renegade shards of life, of RNA or DNA -- the information for life -- without any means of applying that information. Outside of a host cell, viruses are as inert as the books containing their genetic codes. Stedman's medical dictionary describes them as \"entities on the borderline between the living and nonliving.\" They don't live so much as they wait to enter lives in order to go about mindessly making themselves, over and over, at all costs and to no higher purpose.\nSmallpox is considered a very stable virus, meaning that it can wait a long time in the wild -- for decades under certain conditions -- outside of a host cell before it dies or, insofar as it wasn't living to begin with, before it loses its viability. (Human immunodeficiencity virus, or H.I.V., in contrast, is extremely unstable and difficult to transmit. After a brief moment's exposure to the air, it will wither and dissolve.) In fact, the extreme stability of smallpox has led scientists to speculate about the possibility of the virus still existing somewhere in the wild. \"One of the more heavily investigated instances was in the 17th-century Spitalfield crypts in England, back in the 1970's,\" Mahy said. \"A modern building was being erected and it was necessary to remove a lot of lead-lined coffins found at the site. An extensive investigation was done of the liquors contained in the coffins of known smallpox victims but no infectious virus was found.\" Currently, the most likely place being considered is in the permafrost of the Siberian tundra. A team of Russian scientists recently uncovered cadavers of smallpox victims there. Tests of tissue samples did reveal smallpox antigens or proteins, but not the intact infectious virus.\nAs for the question of what a virus that thrives only within us was doing prior to us, no one can say exactly. \"We have a hint,\" Esposito said, \"that smallpox as well as cowpox and the others of the genus emerged from a common rodent ancestor, a virus whose reservoir was a rodent.\"\nWhatever its origin, smallpox is believed to have formerly been one of the harmless pox strains that infect domesticated animals. Then, through pro longed proximity to the early farmers of Africa and Asia, it made what's known in virology as a cross-species transfer, genetically mutating in such a way as to leap over and adapt to us. From Africa, it is thought to have spread to the Hittites in the 14th century B.C. and later to ancient Greece and Persia, and from the Persians to the Huns and with them into China where the disease was known as \"Hunpox.\" Alexander the Great's army was ravaged by smallpox during a campaign in India in the fourth century B.C. The mummy of the Egyptian pharaoh Ramses in the Cairo Museum shows signs of death by smallpox. In ancient Greece, the loss of faith in the sanctity of the polis and the subsequent decline of Athens is thought to have been largely the work of variola major. In his book, \"Princes and Peasants: Smallpox in History,\" Donald R. Hopkins, a member of the original eradication program in West and Central Africa, cites Thucydides' description of a devastating smallpox epidemic in 430 B.C.: \"Athens owed to the plague the beginnings of a state of unprecedented lawlessness. . . . As for the gods, it seemed to be the same thing whether one worshipped them or not when one saw the good and the bad dying indiscriminately.\"\nSmallpox ravaged Rome with a major epidemic in the second century A.D., killing the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. It spread across Europe and would continue to visit plagues upon its major cities up until the end of the 19th century. Generations of European royalty were ravaged by smallpox. In the 16th century, the disease was introduced into southern Mexico by one African slave on board the ship of the conquistador Panfilo de Narvaez and it would end up killing millions of Aztecs, Mayans and Incas, facilitating the Spanish conquest. The native peoples of North America and Canada were devastated by smallpox disseminated, at times intentionally, by settlers. In 1763, Sir Jeffrey Amherst, commander in chief of British forces in North America, ordered his troops to hand out smallpox-contaminated blankets among the Iroquois. This is the first known instance of biological warfare. \nAlthough an effective vaccine was discovered at the end of the 18th century, the disease continued to plague major cities in the United States and Canada well into the 19th century. Prior to the vaccine, people could only guess at how to combat smallpox. They tried everything from palm oil to powdered horse excrement. Bloodletting and purgatives were common treatments, but perhaps the most universal and useless therapy stemmed from the belief that the color red could promote a cure. From before the Christian era right up until the end of the 20th century, in cultures as disparate as the Japanese and the British, variola victims -- the royal and the rank and file alike -- were being wrapped in red blankets, dressed in red clothes, having their rooms fully draped in red curtains, even being exposed to the rays of special red lamps, all by way of trying to excite the blood and bring it and the malady thought to be dwelling within it to the surface.\nRemarkably, successful inoculation against smallpox was being practiced in China, India and Africa over a thousand years ago. As early as the 10th century, the Chinese were taking the dried scabs of previous smallpox victims and blowing them up the nose of healthy people to ward off the disease. In the early 1700's, a handful of attentive travelers to the Near East and Africa brought word of inoculation back to Europe and North America, where it soon became a widespread practice. Then, in 1796, a British doctor named Edward Jenner conducted some experiments based on the stories of English milkmaids who, having contracted cowpox from milking infected cows, claimed to have immunity from smallpox. He soon determined that by injecting healthy people with a closely related pox, vaccinia, they would have immunity to variola. It would be a long time, however, before vaccination was established as a uniform practice. For more than 70 years after Edward Jenner's discovery, the world was still unaware of the existence of germs or microorganisms. It was therefore quite a leap for some to accept that they could protect themselves against one dreaded disease by being injected with another that infects cows.\nBut in the long history of the battle with smallpox perhaps the most substantial leap of imagination was made back in the mid-1960's with the decision to try to eliminate the virus from the planet altogether. \"It began with a proposal by Viktor Zhdanov,\" Donald A. Henderson, the former director of the smallpox eradication program and now a senior science adviser in the Department of Health and Human Services, told me one afternoon in his Washington office. \"He was then the Vice Minister of Health for the Soviet Union. It was the first serious statement by anyone that we could even do this.\"\nNot long after a shocking outbreak of smallpox in New York City in 1947, in which more than six million residents had to be vaccinated, Henderson was apppointed head of a smallpox surveillance unit that urged the Army to develop a new vaccination device: the \"ped-o-jet,\" a foot-powered hydraulic injector that would play a major role in the eventual success of the eradication program, enabling health workers to travel widely, without recourse to electricity. Along with the ped-o-jet and a recently refined, freeze-dried vaccine that, unlike previous versions of vaccinia, retained its potency in any climate for months without refrigeration, the members of the eradication campaign also had smallpox on their side.\n\"The virus's very visible and somewhat plodding path of infection made it relatively easy to track,\" William H. Foege told me at the C.D.C. last October. Foege had been working as a medical missionary for the Lutheran Church in eastern Nigeria when the eradication program began and now works for the Carter Center in Atlanta. \"Two weeks after people came down with the disease, they were either dead or immune for life.\" \nFoege was also the architect of a new strategy called surveillance-containment: isolating areas of outbreak and then vaccinating there. This freed health workers from the burden of mass vaccination and preserved often-limited supplies of vaccine. In January 1968, a year after the start of the initial West and Central Africa campaign, a ceremony was held on a soccer field in Ghana to celebrate the 25-millionth vaccination. According to the then-director of the C.D.C., David J. Sencer, the recipient, a schoolgirl named Rebecca Ansah Asamoah, \"screamed bloody murder.\" Two and a halfyears later, the complete eradication of smallpox in all 20 of the targeted countries was confirmed.\n\"I remember when we came up with the new strategy,\" Foege recalled excitedly. \"We were sitting up, my fellow workers and I, late at night around a kerosene lantern in a little hut in Nigeria, miles from any road, deliberately trying to outthink smallpox. That's a troubling image when you consider that a virus hasn't even the semblance of a brain. And do you know what question we asked? 'What would we do, where would we go next, if we were a smallpox virus?' \"\nOf course, what Foege and the others could never have imagined, sitting up in their hut that night, is that nearly 20 years after the final capture of smallpox, the search would resume within the virus itself.THE SILENCE OF THE LABS\nAmong the people I met in Esposito's Room 211 lab that day was a research microbiologist named Janice Knight. In order to map the genetic code of smallpox, the DNA first had to be extracted from the virus. To do this, the prisoner had to be taken from the freezer in 318B and brought to the maximum security BSL 4 laboratory where it was thawed, placed in tissue culture and brought briefly back to life. This was the job of Janice Knight and her colleague Robert Massung. They have the dubious distinction of being the last people on earth to visit the live variola virus.\n\"The virus was transported in a sealed container to the maximum security unit in Building 15,\" Knight recalled matter of factly. \"I put on my scrub suit and rubber gloves, took the vial with the frozen virus and went inside the containment area just outside the lab door where I put on a full-body pressurized space suit. I zipped it up and then passed through the air-lock doors with the vial of smallpox into the BSL 4 lab.\"\nLike Room 318B, the BSL 4 lab is normally off limits to someone like myself, but it just happened to be in a washdown stage between projects the day I was there and so later that afternoon I was allowed access. Upon entering the antechamber outside the lab's double air-lock entrance doors, I saw a row of the blue plastic \"space suits\" Janice Knight had spoken of, hanging from a set of wall hooks. They look like outsize feet pajamas with bright yellow rubber gloves attached at the wrists, clear visor hoods and metal air-valve attachments jutting from the side.\n\"You don't have much feeling in your hands, because of the gloves over other gloves,\" Knight said. \"You have to move very slowly so you don't knock things over.\"\nInside the main lab room, coiled red air hoses dangle every few feet or so from the ceiling. A worker moving from station to station or room to room detaches from one hose and hooks up to the next. There's enough air in the suit to go two or three minutes without hooking up to another hose. Air pressure within the lab's rooms decreases the farther you move toward the center of the building, so that all air flows inward and then up through a special filtration system. The floor above and the one below the BSL 4 lab are entirely devoted to maintaining and purging its environment. Upstairs, there are banks of HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filters designed to trap the most minute particles flowing in and out of the lab. Downstairs, there are rows of backup air-supply tanks, a huge diesel back-up generator and two 1,000-gallon tanks for heating and decontaminating liquid waste before it's cooled and released into the public sewer system.\n\"Once inside the lab in the suit, you're pretty much isolated,\" Knight said. \"It's just you and your air hose. It's a bit like scuba diving.\"\nWhite-tiled, air-locked, soundless, the lab rooms did seem to be deep under water. The light inside was flashbulb bright, exposing every flat surface and corner. A four-foot-high, square liquid nitrogen freezer for storing vials was set against one wall with the lid open. There was a set of glass-enclosed work tables known as \"laminar-flow biosafety cabinets.\" They, too, have negative air pressure and just an 8-inch-wide opening in front for workers to stick their hands through and work with their \"hot agents.\"\n\"I thawed the virus,\" Janice Knight went on, \"and then grew it up on human tissue. We have established cell lines from human tissue, immortal cell lines. It's considered immortal because you can keep splitting the cells and passing them along forever.\"\nAfter variola sprang to life and began replicating, Knight extracted the DNA and placed it in a solution of phenol. All solid waste material from the workday goes to the innermost BSL 4 room, where there some trash bins with bright red biohazard symbols on them and two autoclaves built into the back wall. All workers exit BSL 4 through a set of double-air-lock doors, the space between which also serves as a chemical shower. A worker hooks up to a red air hose and must stand for a minimum of four minutes under a steady spray of Lysol.\n\"I had the DNA in a one-and-a-half-milliliter epindorph centrifuge tube,\" Knight said. \"I carried it out by hand. The exterior of the tube had been washed in Clorox and then put inside another sterile tube within a sterile hood, and all that was brought with me through the Lysol shower so there was no way any virus was coming out with me.\"\nIt all might sound a bit extreme until you hear about the other kinds of creatures handled in BSL 4. There's the group of tick-borne encephalitis viruses, for example, or the Muerto Canyon hantavirus that last summer killed 27 people in the Southwest. A previously unknown and far more virulent relative of the hantavirus that originated in Korea and China, Muerto Canyon was first identified in the BSL 4 lab less than three weeks after its sudden and mysterious emergence. There have since been isolated cases across the United States, from California to New York. The virus causes influenzalike symptoms for the first few days and then leads to pulmonary edema. The lungs fill with bloody fluid and victims literally drown in themselves.\nThe hemorraghic fever viruses are held in BSL 4: Marburg, Lassa, Junin, Machupo, Congo-Crimean and Ebola -- both Ebola Sudan and one of the deadliest human viruses ever known, Ebola Zaire. Classified as a filovirus because of it's gnarled, threadlike appearance, Ebola Zaire made a sudden, memorable debut back in 1976 when it struck 55 villages near the river for which it's named. The virus bedevils the blood, causing it to simultaneously clot and thin. Clots lodge throughout the body, inducing internal hemorrhaging. As the disease advances, virus-ridden blood streams from the mouth, nose, anus and up through the skin, rendering it the consistency of rotting fruit. The virus seems to spread this way, on rivulets of its victims' escaping blood. Ebola killed nearly 90 percent of those it infected. Only AIDS and rabies have higher death rates.SECRETS OF A PATHOGEN\nI was pleased to leave BSL 4 that day, to get away even from the ghosts of such beings. I remember walking the grounds around the C.D.C. complex the following morning. Directly across the road from the BSL 4 lab, which is both earthquake- and tornado-proof and looks from the outside like some post-modern military bunker, is a day-care center for children. It was a bright, cloudless day and I could hear on the wind the sound of the children playing somewhere out back. This is where we are now in the world, I thought: advanced to the point where we can label and keep previously unknowable threats insidehuge buildings within a normal day and yet remain as oblivious and vulnerable as ever to those threats.\nOne of the defining conceits of modernity is that we have dispensed with plagues, that we are rapidly rendering the world as harmless and sterile as a suburban kitchen counter top. The spread of AIDS has by now disabused many of us of such a notion. And yet our mind-set about the natural world still seems to be stuck midway between the old assumptions of our singularity and supremacy and the plain biological reality that new viruses like Ebola continue to point up to us: that we are but one of many competing species on the planet and will be long outlived by organisms like viruses.\nAs they have already done with smallpox, scientists have begun to identify the viral genus or family to which H.I.V. belongs. One close cousin was discovered a few years after H.I.V. and is now designated as H.I.V.-2. It is endemic to the western coast of sub-Saharan Africa, is barely present in those parts of Africa where H.I.V. is rampant and causes far milder symptoms, allowing victims to live longer than victims with H.I.V. Another relative is simian immunodeficiency virus, or S.I.V., which is nearly identical genetically to H.I.V.-2 and, as near as anyone can tell, has been infecting, though not killing, an African monkey known as the sooty mangabey for thousands of years. Scientists believe that H.I.V. began as a simian immunodeficiency virus and, just as smallpox is thought to have done thousands of years ago, made one of those cross-species leaps to humans. Muerto Canyon hantavirus and the hemorrhagic fevers are thought to have reached us by similar means. Whatever the origin of viruses might be, and however peripheral and inert their existence may seem, they apparently have no trouble keeping up with us.\nThere have been, along with the conquest of smallpox, some other notable advances made against killer pathogens. The W.H.O. has set a target date of late 1995 for the eradication of dracunculiasis, or Guinea worm, a particularly nasty, water-borne organism that bores through the skin of the feet and grows into a long stringy worm that eats away at the connective tissue of the legs and trunk and can only be drawn back out by winding it slowly around a stick. Polio has been slated by the W.H.O. for complete eradication by the year 2000 and measles, which still kills over two and a half million children a year, for some time shortly thereafter. In fact, one of the reasons that so much attention is being paid to the decision made about smallpox is that both advocates and opponents of the destruction see the final outcome of this case as establishing a precedent.\n\"It's a symbolic thing,\" Mahy told me in his office that afternoon. \"It says that mankind is not afraid of eliminating potential dangers.\"\nStill, these are somewhat hollow victories. Like smallpox, what polio and measles have in common is us. Human beings are their only reservoir, and this makes them easier to isolate and attack. As for Ebola Zaire, Muerto Canyon and the others, they are known as \"emerging viruses.\" The term is a bit misleading in that such viruses have been around for ages. It's just that we are now interrupting them and commingling with them more often, especially as civilization continues to advance upon previously undeveloped environments, like rain forests, where the majority of these \"emerging\" viruses wait. The threat of a catastrophic outbreak is never more than a jet flight away.\nThe presence of these new threats would seem to render a retired death-row prisoner like smallpox an afterthought. \"In simple economic terms,\" Mahy said, \"many ask whether we really want to start funding research on a virus we've eradicated when we have so many new diseases like Ebola and the new hantavirus to deal with?\"\nBut to those hoping for another stay of execution, emerging viruses are precisely why something like smallpox should be kept around. To Esposito and scores of others, smallpox is the viral equivalent of a Hannibal Lecter, capable of enlightening those who dare to visit with it, of shedding insight on the methods of other serial-killer viruses.\nOne suspect that virologists are keeping an eye on is an old cousin of variola, monkeypox. The virus was first discovered in the monkeys of Zaire but its actual reservoir has since been determined to be squirrels. For reasons still unclear, this particular pox virus is not readily transmitted to or among people. Only some 300 cases have been recorded, and no single outbreak has spread beyond five people. But many worry about monkeypox making the necessary and not unlikely cross-species mutations that would allow it to, as Esposito puts it, \"fill the niche that we voided by vaccinating the world against smallpox.\"\n\"How would we deal with that?\" Esposito asked. \"Vaccinia would be the normal countermeasure, but in Zaire, where there is such a high rate of AIDS, you can't prescribe smallpox vaccine because people with an immunodeficency would die from the vaccine. It presents one with a very odd ethical problem. Do you kill people trying to save them from monkeypox or let them die from either it or AIDS? Or could we find another strategy? By holding on to the actual smallpox virus and conducting experiments, we've already begun to learn how smallpox works.\" What has Esposito and others in the field most intrigued is the discovery of previously unknown viral proteins that smallpox produces. These proteins block the host cell's natural ability to stave off infection. A better understanding of how this happens, Esposito said, might one day help scientists devise a means of combatting viruses without relying on vaccines -- a strategy that could instead stop the production of the proteins, or even employ them to some curative end.\n\"It is unbelieveable to me that people would want to destroy this virus now,\" said Wolfgang K. Joklik, former chairman of the department of microbiology and immunology at Duke University, in a recent phone conversation. \"We just discovered the smallpox protein that tells the cell to shut down when invaded by a virus. This is how smallpox gets the cell to manufacture more smallpox. Now this is a gene we knew nothing about a year ago, and there are a hundred more of them. It seems absolutely ridiculous to me to throw them away, especially when we have something like AIDS, which we're nowhere near being able to stop and will infect hundreds of millions of people. By using smallpox to find out more about the components of the human defense mechanism, we might be able to determine which of the cell's components the AIDS virus interacts with and overcomes.\"\nIn fact, a number of virologists have noted that the eradication of smallpox in Africa and the rise of AIDS were coincidental, and it has been suggested that there may be a causal relationship there as well. Hundreds of millions of people were vaccinated, and the speculation is that AIDS may have been sparked either through the repeated use of H.I.V.-contaminated ped-o-jet lancets or via a phenomenon known as co-infection in which the injected vaccinia virus somehow activates a latent H.I.V. infection. There is no way to verify such a theory, but if it is true, and if what we were to learn from smallpox could help us in some way in the fight against a virus like H.I.V., then the story of the ancient scourge that is variola will have truly come full circle.\n\"I will go along with what the W.H.O. decides,\" Esposito told me before I left the C.D.C. that afternoon. \"But in my view, we need the whole intact virus and its gene products, the virus proteins, in order to learn. We just don't know enough about viruses or the human defense system to say that we don't. To me it's a matter of preparedness for the future.\"AWAITING THE VERDICT\nIn just over two weeks, the Ad Hoc Committee on Orthopox Virus Infections will be meeting in Room E110 at the W.H.O. headquarters in Geneva to make its final recommendation on the fate of variola. The decision will be passed along to the W.H.O.'s executive board, whose members will meet next January and then pass along the minutes of that meeting along with their recommendation to all 187 member countries of the W.H.O. After an open discussion among the representatives of those countries at the annual World Health Assembly, a final decision will be announced. \nFrom all early indications, things don't look good for smallpox. Of the 11 doctors on the committee meeting this Sept. 9 in Geneva, it appears that at least 9 of them will vote to destroy. When I brought up the matter with Peter Greenaway, of the Department of Health in London, at a meeting in Geneva in January, he seemed decidedly impatient with the whole business. \"Biological species have been disappearing for thousands of years,\" he told me. \"Are we really worrying about one particularly nasty virus?\" \nAt bottom, those who favor destroying smallpox do so not out of hubris but out of a carefully weighed concern that the killer virus might somehow escape and wreak havoc on a nonvaccinated world. Henderson, who as head of the eradication program would have as much right as anyone to bear a personal vendetta against smallpox, says: \"I've thought about it a lot and I feel we can get all we need from variola's relatives without the risk of keeping the one strain that's harmful to us. So I think we should destroy.\"\nThose who favor saving smallpox think the dire escape scenarios are greatly exaggerated and they note that scientists would know how to control an outbreak. \"If it did happen to get out,\" Joklik added, \"and a few people were to get sick, that would be a terrible thing. But why are we so caught up in the age of the individual? Why can't we see down the road and understand how many lives we might save with what we learn from this virus?\"\nIt's difficult to know whether the opinions of the Geneva committee accurately reflect those of scientists at large. But if a round-table discussion on the subject in Glasgow, Scotland, last August is any indication, the answer is no. Of the more than 500 virologists, biologists and microbiologists from around the world who participated, at least half argued for preserving smallpox. \nParadoxically, those calling for destruction also invoke the new gene sequencing technology now to bolster their argument. They assert that with the genetic maps and DNA clones of smallpox on hand, we have all that's required for future research -- even the ability to reassemble smallpox from the separate pieces of DNA. The problem there, said Stephen S. Morse, a virologist at Rockefeller University, is that we can't be sure the reassembled smallpox will be exactly the same as the original and create the same effects within the host cell as the natural variola virus.\nIn essence, the wide-ranging debate about smallpox comes down to how much one believes in the riches that might be mined from one-millionth of a micron. This is the space in which most new scientific discoveries are being made these days, and it seems now, as with the supercollider and the space program, that the continued pursuit of smallpox depends on our willingness to fund the exploration of potential dead ends.\nBut for now, at least, it appears that more immediate worldly concerns will preclude our making any otherworldly advances with smallpox. \"I was absolutely against destroying the virus a few years ago,\" Yuri Z. Ghendon, a top health official at the W.H.O. and the former director of the department of general virology at the Moscow Research Institute, told me in Geneva in January. \"I fought with all the committee members who wanted to eradicate, telling them that if we keep the virus in safe conditions, nothing will happen. But with all the incidents of late, the terrorists' bombings of the World Trade Towers in New York, bombings in London and Italy, I have changed my view. Now, when we discuss this smallpox matter so widely, how do you know terrorists won't read this and go to the C.D.C. with a bomb? And look at the situation with the political uprising in Moscow last October. What if a fire had been set to the Research Institute where we store the virus? The institute is not like the C.D.C. It's a very old building.\"BEHIND CORRODING BARS\nI flew to Moscow in May in one last attempt to view variola in captivity. My chances appeared good at the outset. I'd arranged to meet with the lab director, Otar Andzhaparidze, who agreed to give me a tour of the Research Institute. But a series of articles in the Moscow newspapers criticizing the poor conditions and lack of security at the lab had left Andzhaparidze feeling less than kindly toward reporters.\nWe met in a vast empty conference room on the second floor of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences -- one of downtown Moscow's many crumbling, pale yellow, 19th-century buildings. The bottle of expensive Scotch I'd bought as a last-ditch offering was set on the table between us. Andzhaparidze regarded it with a slow stroke of his aged, jowly, Georgian chins, put the bottle in his black briefcase and then handed me in return a stack of official documents that he said would explain the present position of the Russian Government about the keeping of smallpox. \"Not such a good trade for you,\" he said, laughing.\nOver the next few minutes I tried in various ways to bring up the subject of my lab tour and then the doctor finally laid down the law. \"Some of the articles written,\" he began, \"can be regarded as direct methodical directions for all kinds of criminals and terrorists to come in and find the virus. When I saw this, I decided to defend ourselves and deprive correspondents the pleasure of writing nasty things.\"\nThe following afternoon I took a cab out to the Research Institute to have a look around on my own. It's a drab yellow, four-story brick building on the industrial southeastern edge of the city. There's a bent iron-spoked fence running around it, topped with barbed wire, and a small brick guardhouse out by the front gate through which all workers and deliveries come and go. Looking in, I could see white-smocked women wheeling bins of medical waste to a large receptacle under a tin shed out back.\nSmallpox is said to be up in a fourth-floor lab at the end of a long, dark hallway in a pair of ordinary-looking kitchen freezers that are set behind a pair of glass doors, locked and wired with special alarms to summon Moscow police from a nearby station in the event of an attempted break-in. The lab does have someone on duty around the clock to watch the place, but there are no armed guards or private security personnel as there are at the C.D.C. -- although Andzhaparidze did say that on the night of the October rebellion he'd hired members of an independent security group armed with tear-gas pistols.\n\"The atmosphere was alarming,\" he recalled. \"But everything worked out. We've been keeping the virus for about 30 years and so far God has spared us.\"\nI felt a bit silly standing outside the Research Institute that day, having flown half way across the world just to stare up from a sooty sidewalk in the vague direction of the other side's smallpox. I wondered if the dilapidation of the institute and of the country around it would ultimately determine the fate of variola. In a sense, the building's crumbling superstructure is incidental to the issue of smallpox's security. W.H.O. officials have not inspected the lab since 1986, but yearly inspections are conducted by the Academy of Medical Sciences, and the W.H.O. has never allowed any work to be done with the virus at the Moscow facility anyway. The only research being done with smallpox in Russia now is the W.H.O.-sanctioned genetic sequencing of the South American \"Garcia\" strain and the \"India\" strain at the modern NPO Vector laboratory in Novosibirsk, Siberia, a former military installation that has since been converted into a private biological research company. \nMuch has also been made of the fact that the institute has no backup generators and therefore depends on the somewhat erratic central Moscow electrical grid to run the freezers. However, kept in a freeze-dried state, the virus stocks are more alive frozen and would soon lose their viability if a power failure allowed the vials to thaw. The only way the stored virus could pose a threat is if the physical integrity of the vials and of the freezers in which they're kept is somehow compromised. I asked Stephen Morse to construct a possible scenario. \"You could have a bomb go off,\" he said, \"or a mortar shell hit in such a way that the freezers open and the vials break and don't get burned themselves so that viable, slightly thawed virus comes running out and gets into the air. Then you could have a problem.\"\nAs for the oft-invoked scenario of terrorists getting hold of the stocks to use them as a weapon, scientists on both sides of the debate agree that smallpox would be a very poor and unlikely biological weapon. \"It doesn't spread that well,\" Foege said. \"All the reasons why we could eradicate it makes it bad as a biological weapon.\" Greenaway concurred: \"It wouldn't even be on the top-20 lists of terrorists weapons.\"\nStill, Morse, who said he'd like to see the virus stick around a while longer if research could be initiated right away and under the right conditions, thinks smallpox would be a rather ideal tool for terrorists. \"Maybe not in terms of numbers killed,\" he said. \"But if you consider that the point of most acts of terrorism is to frighten and demoralize people, then what better way to do that than to unleash a virus the world had thought to be eliminated.\"\nThe issue \"is something we can't turn our backs on,\" Jeffrey W. Almond told me from his office at the University of Reading, outside of London, where he is head of the School of Animal and Microbial Sciences. Almond turned a number of heads at the Glasgow round-table discussion when he announced that at a recent meeting with the British Foreign Office he'd been told that there are at least 6, and perhaps as many as 12, countries in the world still engaged in the development of biological weapons. \"In an ideal world,\" Almond told me, \"I'd argue for the preservation of smallpox for ongoing research. But as we don't live in such a place, I think this is an instance in which we need to take the moral high ground and destroy our stocks to send a very clear signal to these other countries that it's a crime against humanity to develop such weaponry.\nBefore leaving the academy that day, I asked Andzhaparidze his opinion about what we should do with smallpox. His face stiffened. \"Kill it,\" he said. \"No one has asked the populations of the world whether they want the sword of Damocles held over their head. Some scientists have just taken the right to say that we don't have to destroy it. They suffer from what's known among creative people as a crisis of genre. It means they face a dead end with their research project if we destroy the virus. All they want is funding, so they try to frighten bureacrats with awful stories about the reappearance of smallpox in the form of monkeypox and so on. The molecular biologists are far removed from the real problems of medicine and public health. To me the option is we either take care of humankind or of the virus. Molecular biologists care about viruses. Doctors care about people.\"\nIt was on my last day in Moscow that I managed to track down Svetlana Marennikova. She had left her post the year before as the head of the smallpox lab in Moscow after a falling out with Andzhaparidze -- \"I think I'm more independent than he would like,\" she said -- and now spends most of her time as a consultant to the NPO Vector lab in Siberia. She still maintains her apartment with her husband and daughter on the outskirts of Moscow, and I caught up with here there one evening an hour before she was to fly to Canada for a medical conference on pox viruses.\nA tall, handsome woman with dark hair and sad eyes, Marennikova shares a long history with variola. She has been all over the world as one of the eradication program coordinators, served as a member of the W.H.O. committees that both declared the official eradication and the plans for final destruction of the virus and now finds herself one of the lone voices for saving smallpox on the W.H.O. committee that will meet early next month.\n\"As I thought more and more,\" she told me, \"I knew we couldn't destroy this virus. It's taking us into a completely new branch of science.\"\nMarennikova told me she was out at her dacha the night of the troubles last October and that she sat frozen with fear thinking about the smallpox vials. \"Moscow is not the right place to keep this virus,\" she said. \"It's such an unstable city, and the lab has deteriorated since the W.H.O. chose to keep the stocks there. But the point is that it's just a waste to keep smallpox there now. At Novosibirsk, we have a much-better-equipped facility where researchers are already engaged in work on the virus. At the institute, they just store viruses. It's so useless. It's just dead weight awaiting the moment of destruction.\"\nMarennikova's packed suitcase lay open on the living room floor beside her. Her husband stood by the kitchen door with her coat. As we both stood up, she explained wearily that she wasn't optimistic about the chances of saving smallpox, that the debate had become \"mostly political now.\" Two of the thumbs-down votes, she said, would come from representatives of India and Brazil who pose a question that was raised by third-world countries back in 1980 when the world's remaining stocks of smallpox were divvied up between the Soviet Union and the United States: Why do only the big powers get to keep and work with the virus?\nStill, Marennikova said, she will go to Geneva in September and make her argument one last time. In a sense, she'll be asking her colleagues to make the same imaginative leap on behalf of smallpox that her countryman Viktor Zhdanov called for 30 years earlier in initiating its eradication.\n\"I cannot say with an easy heart that we should leave smallpox alive eternally,\" she said. \"But I know this is not the time to kill it. Smallpox is valuable precisely because we are its only host.\""}, {"text": "The World; Aid Agencies Hope to Enlist Military Allies In the Future\n1994-08-21T05:00:00.000Z\nTO those who were old hands at dealing with human disasters, the rapid descent of a million Rwandan refugees onto this God-forsaken stretch of land had a depressingly familiar initial result: Many died before relief arrived.\nBut disease and death, for all their seeming relentlessness, were finally slowed in large part by the same sorts of military skills that distinguished the allied victory in the Persian Gulf war: the ability of military personnel to organize the supply of water, shelter, sanitation, medicine and food for vast numbers of people over great distances under challenging conditions.\nSo now that they are able to cope with, if not overcome, the Rwandan crisis, relief officials are taking a lesson from the tragedy of the Hutu and Tutsi refugees. What the world's relief agencies need, they now believe, is more logistical support from the world's armies.\nRelief experts have in mind not so much the high-profile, and risky, French military presence in Rwanda, which is to end tomorrow with the withdrawal of 2,000 troops from the safe haven they set up in the west (although they are being urged to stay to continue to provide security inside the country and thus discourage a new exodus, which already appears to be under way).\nRather, the experts are more encouraged by the success of the discreet non-combat support provided here by the Americans, Irish, Israelis and Dutch. Big Help\nThe Americans in July sent more soldiers to Goma than any other nation -- just over 200 with a backup of nearly 900 at Entebbe, Uganda, running an airlift. The soldiers here have provided water, bulldozed campsites and helped with other heavy-duty logistical tasks.\nOther countries contributed as well. Israel sent soldiers to set up a field hospital for worst-case surgery. Nearly 100 Dutch soldiers were dispatched with vital equipment including heavy-duty trucks to support Dutch doctors and nurses of the agency Doctors Without Borders. And the Irish sent 25 troops to work with two Irish relief agencies, Concern and Goal.\nThe success of these efforts has led some to wonder why such responses aren't more common, given the world's many relief crises. Dr. Michael Toole, coordinator of overseas emergencies for the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and a veteran of numerous disasters over more than a decade, asked: \"Why do we have to respond from scratch every time? Why not have a rapid response humanitarian relief force made up from armies that could provide support to the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs?\"\nSome governments would no doubt respond to Dr. Toole's proposal warily. There is the obvious caution that, for their own safety, Good Samaritans -- military as well as civilian -- should not be seen as participants in the conflicts underlying such disasters. The United States learned that lesson the hard way when its peacekeepers became embroiled in Somalia's war of warlords (though in the refugee crisis touched off by the Gulf war, it freely chose to side with the Kurds against Saddam Hussein, and still does in protecting their enclave). In Zaire, the Irish and Dutch are even more low-profile than the Americans, for their military personnel work out of uniform.\nThe agency that the United Nations relies on to save lives acknowledged from the outset that it was overwhelmed by the scale of human suffering in Goma.\n\"To me it was clear when I landed that we needed military help,\" said Philippo Grandi, the emergency coordinator for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, who arrived in Goma in mid-July soon after the bulk of the Hutu refugees streamed here in the face of advances by Tutsi-led rebels, who eventually ousted the government in Kigali.\nPresident Clinton agreed to send an American contingent, but armies don't deploy in a flash, especially when the national interest is not at stake. \"The mobilization took longer than I would have liked, but once it arrived it solved many problems,\" said Mr. Grandi.\nAmerican soldiers did not begin work in Goma until July 28, 11 days after the bulk of the refugees arrived and seven days after the outbreak of cholera. But soon they were pumping water from Lake Kivu, putting it in tankers and delivering it to the camp. By Aug. 12, instead of having to walk more than 24 miles or wait for up to 12 hours for a dribble of water, most refugees had access to the minimum daily survival ration of five liters.\nTo foster mutual understanding between relief workers and officers, Maj. Richard Hooker of the United States Army was dispatched to the United Nations' Goma office. \"We plug into the refugee agency and allow them to determine priorities,\" said Major Hooker, who served in Somalia.\nLast week, Major Hooker was telling Mr. Grandi that American forces had sent 90 tons of medicine from Germany. From Uganda, the Americans would be flying in 400 tons of soap. It was up to Mr. Grandi to decide how the provisions would be distributed.\nThe Pentagon seems to think it has found a winning strategy here. (Somalia aside, there is a happy recent precedent: the American military assistance provided to Bangladesh after a 1991 typhoon.) Three of the military top brass have come to Goma to have a look: Defense Secretary William J. Perry; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John M. D. Shalikashvili, and the Army Chief of Staff, Gen. Gordon Sullivan. Yet clearly their view is that such operations should be of limited duration; American soldiers are scheduled to hand their operations over to a contractor by the end of August.\nStill, the Pentagon has agreed to leave behind pumping equipment, tankers and water storage installations, giving the United Nations its first large-scale hardware to deal with future refugee crises on the continent. Now all that's needed, suggest Dr. Toole and others, is a ready-to-go unit of soldiers to operate the gear."}, {"text": "Haiti's Capital Throbs With New Life\n1994-11-01T05:00:00.000Z\nHaiti's capital is bustling again. At night, with people no longer fearful they will be kidnapped and killed by the gunmen the army used as enforcers, restaurants are full. People are flocking to bars and music clubs to dance to their favorite songs in the syncopated Haitian compas style.\nAnd on streets that were eerily vacant once darkness fell even two months ago, families take late-night walks to buy ice cream at parlors that have been able to reopen because they now have a regular supply of electricity.\nOn every corner, it seems, stores have reopened and informal markets have spilled out into the streets, attracting huge numbers of customers and gapers from dawn until dusk. With the lifting of the American-led embargo that crippled the Haitian economy and with cargo arriving again, Haitians are rushing to buy and sell goods not seen here in more than a year, from perfume to automobile parts.\nIn neighborhood after neighborhood, both rich and poor, Port-au-Prince, the capital, is once again coming fully to life. While the new feeling of well-being has not yet reached many areas of the countryside, Port-au-Prince's 1.5 million residents are realizing that the worst of their ordeal is over and resuming business routines and simple pleasures with an intensity that suggests they are trying to make up for lost time.\n\"I never could have imagined that normal life for Haitians could be like this,\" said a diplomat who arrived here little more than a year ago, at the height of the military repression and just before the start of the most severe international economic sanctions. \"Only now that I see Haitians relaxed and breathing easy do I realize the full extent of what this country has been through.\"\nEven the President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, has joined in, finally emerging from the National Palace, where he was sequestered for all but a few hours of the first two weeks of his return from exile. Accompanied by an intimidating American military escort, he left the official presidential quarters late Friday to spend a long weekend at his private residence in a middle-class neighborhood near the airport.\nBeyond the reduction in fear, much of the resurgence can be traced to a single factor: a dramatic shift in the supply and cost of gasoline. For the last year, gasoline was available only on the black market at prices that surged to $15 a gallon or more because of the economic sanctions applied against Haiti's military Government by the United Nations. But for the last week, gasoline has been selling at the pump for a much more congenial $2 a gallon.\n\"I took my car out of storage this week and drove it for the first time in almost six months,\" Serge Etienne, a 42-year-old bank employee, said happily as he filled the tank of a battered Honda Civic at a reopened gas station. \"Gasoline was getting so costly toward the end, and thus the bus fares so high, that often I could only afford to walk to work.\"\nAs a result of the cheaper gasoline, however, the streets are clogged with more cars than ever before, local residents say. Formidable traffic jams are now common around schools at starting and closing time and on main arteries full of axle-breaking potholes that the former corrupt military dictatorship neglected to repair. Even worse, the return of automobile traffic has cast a hazy blanket of smog over the capital and fouled the air.\nTo control the congestion, which often threatens to bring all movement on the streets to a halt, international police monitors from Bangladesh, in green uniforms and yellow hats, have been directing traffic at major intersections. The remnants of the Haitian police force, which was more skilled at terrorizing the population than at normal police duties, often stand by observing. The Haitian officers have tried to apply the lessons they are learning, but they are held in such contempt that drivers often simply ignore them.\nGuy Malary International Airport, renamed earlier this month in honor of President Aristide's assassinated Justice Minister, has become another center of commotion. Large crowds gather outside the terminal every afternoon during the hours the United States military has set aside for commercial traffic. The planes arriving from New York, Miami, Montreal, Paris and the Caribbean are full of jubilant Haitians returning from exile with oversized gifts and tearful embraces for the relatives they had been forced to leave behind.\n\"Oh, it is like a dream come true to finally be back home again,\" Hubert Maillot said as he disembarked last week and craned his neck looking for his brother and mother, who were to meet him. \"There were times when I wondered if it would ever happen.\"\nAmerican Airlines and other carriers that have resumed regular flights to Haiti report that their planes are carrying full cargo loads as businesses rush to replenish supplies of goods and raw materials that were exhausted during the embargo. Much of the freight belongs to \"Madame Sarahs,\" the generic name given here to the generally portly and gaudily dressed women who dominate small-scale commerce in market towns around the country.\nThe upsurge in activity on the streets contrasts sharply with the silence emanating from President Aristide, who remains under heavy security and out of reach of ordinary Haitians. During his first eight months in office before his exile, the President thrived on contact with his supporters. But until he departed late Friday for his home in the suburb of Tabarre, he had left the palace grounds for only one public event in the two weeks since his return and has only occasionally been seen or heard on television or radio.\nInstead, friends and former opponents alike have been going to the palace to meet with him behind closed doors. Last week he met with leaders of political parties to discuss, among other things, how to revise the timetable to allow adequate preparation for parliamentary elections that were originally scheduled for next month, and he has telephoned prominent business leaders who supported the coup that overthrew him.\n\"I smile because I want to go to the countryside,\" President Aristide said Saturday at an informal news conference at his home when he was asked why he had remained cloistered in the palace. \"I stay here because I have a lot to do, but at the same time I try to make it easier for those who are trying to provide security.\"\nAssociates of the President said that much of his time in recent days has been devoted to putting together his Cabinet. Last week, he nominated Smark Michel, a 57-year-old businessman, as Prime Minister. But 13 other Cabinet posts, along with several Supreme Court seats, must also be filled, and the process has not been easy.\nThe left wing of the Lavalas movement, the broad coalition that brought Father Aristide to power in the December 1990 election, was disappointed that he did not choose his Foreign Minister, Claudette Werleigh, for the top job, so it is looking for some measure of satisfaction in the other appointments.\nBut President Aristide is also said to be feeling pressure from the United States and the business community, still deeply suspicious of his populist instincts. They are urging him to look beyond his immediate circle of associates to fill some of the more sensitive slots, especially those having to do with trade and the economy.\nUnder that pressure, President Aristide clearly relished the chance to take a look at his simply but elegantly furnished home, which had to be redecorated after he returned because Haitian soldiers and policemen had ripped out air-conditioning and plumbing, smashed windows and fouled the floor while he was in exile.\nThe President said he was \"happy to be back at my house, but happier to forget about what they did.\""}, {"text": "NATO, Expanding Bosnia Role, Strikes a Serbian Base in Croatia\n1994-11-22T05:00:00.000Z\nNATO warplanes bombed a Serbian-controlled air base in Croatia today, destroying its runway and its antiaircraft defenses and taking the Western alliance's political involvement in the Bosnian war to a new level.\nAdm. Leighton W. Smith, the American who commands NATO forces in Southern Europe, said 39 aircraft from the United States, Britain, France and the Netherlands had taken part in the attack against the Udbina airfield in Croatia.\nThe base was used three times in the last two weeks by nationalist Serbs to send aircraft -- some carrying napalm and cluster bombs -- against the Muslim-held Bihac area of Bosnia, 22 miles away.\nThe NATO bombing was the largest air raid in Europe since the end of World War II and the biggest mounted by the alliance since it was established in 1949 to counter Soviet military power. With it came a warning to the Serbs that the United Nations and NATO were prepared to use force again if provoked.\nMichael Williams, a spokesman for the United Nations peacekeepers here, said that \"in a raid of this size there must certainly have been casualties.\" There was no immediate estimate of their number.\nAt the request of United Nations military commanders, the raid did not hit Serbian planes at the airfield. This gesture of restraint reportedly gave some NATO officials misgivings.\nBut Admiral Smith said the commander of United Nations forces in the former Yugoslavia, Lieut. Gen. Bertrand de Lapresle of France, had insisted that aircraft not be hit.\n\"This is a limited strike,\" the admiral said. \"We clearly could have taken those aircraft had we chosen to, but we have a dual United Nations-NATO key.\"\nThe French Defense Ministry issued a statement saying that \"after neutralization of the ground-to-air defenses, the runway, which was the raid's main objective, was put out of action.\"\nThe Clinton Administration's repeated calls for big NATO air strikes against the Serbs, combined with its refusal to put American troops on the ground, have caused persistent tension with British and French officers in the United Nations peacekeeping force in Bosnia.\nYasushi Akashi, the top United Nations official in the former Yugoslavia, and General de Lapresle justified their request for the NATO air strike today on two main grounds: the threat to civilians within the Bihac \"safe area\" from the Serbian air raids and the plight of more than 1,000 newly arrived United Nations troops from Bangladesh trapped in the area and fast running out of food.\nAll allied planes returned safely to their bases, despite what officials described as initially intense antiaircraft fire. NATO officials said American F/A 18 fighter-bombers, F-16 fighter-bombers, F-15 fighters and F-111 bombers had been used in the raid. They were accompanied by British Jaguar bombers, French Jaguars and Mirages and Dutch F-16's.\nThe raid amounted to a declaration that NATO will now act with more resolve, and a calculated gamble that the Serbs can be bombed to the negotiating table. Four pinprick air strikes this year against Serbian ground targets appeared to achieve little except to irritate the Pentagon by their tentative nature.\nThe attack today also papered over, at least temporarily, the sharp differences that have emerged within NATO over the Clinton Administration's decision to stop enforcing a United Nations arms embargo against the Bosnian Government. The move has been criticized by France, Britain and Spain.\nBut the risks of the bombing are high. The raid did nothing in itself to break the Serbian encirclement of the Bihac pocket, which remains acutely vulnerable and short of food. And more than 10,000 United Nations personnel are working in the Serbian-held parts of Croatia, all of whom are now potential targets for reprisals.\nMilan Martic, the leader of the ethnic Serbs who have occupied close to a third of Croatia since they went to war in 1991 to resist becoming part of an independent Croatia, issued a defiant statement: \"Bombing of the Udbina airfield is an insolent and vandalous act, which we have not provoked at all. This will certainly not contribute to the establishment of peace in this region.\"\nMr. Akashi, the United Nations official, said he had spoken to Mr. Martic today and tried to explain that the raid had been a \"necessary and proportionate response\" to the Serbian attacks on Bihac.\nBut Mr. Akashi added that \"it was implicit in my remarks that force could be used again\" if the Croatian Serbs did not cease their active support for attacks on Bihac.\nIn general, Western officials were at pains to emphasize the limited scope of the raid, saying that only runways, antiaircraft artillery and surface-to-air missiles had been destroyed and that no attempt had been made to hit Serbian planes.\n\"Our intention was to try to limit collateral damage,\" Admiral Smith said. \"We did not want to go outside of the airfield area, and we wanted to limit the number of the people on the ground who might be casualties as a result of the strike.\"\nDouglas Hurd, the British Foreign Secretary, said the raid was a justified response to the threat to Bihac, but did not represent any taking of sides. \"We don't see a military victory for one side or another in this war,\" he said, \"and we are not involved in helping one side or another to a military victory, as we think that is impossible.\"\nWith United Nations peacekeepers vulnerable on the ground, the aim of such statements is clearly to convince the Serbs that reprisals are unjustified and negotiation the only solution to the war.\nBut in the past, the Serbs have proved deaf to such appeals, responding to much smaller NATO actions with harassment, hostage-taking and general obstruction of United Nations operations in Bosnia.\n\"I hope that today's NATO air attack will deter any further attack on the Bihac safe area and its surroundings or on United Nations personnel within Bihac,\" Mr. Akashi said.\nHe received authority on Saturday from the United Nations Security Council to use NATO air power on Croatian territory. Previously such authority was confined to Bosnia.\nThe current Serbian assault on Bihac came in response to a successful offensive late last month by the V Corps of the Muslim-led Bosnian Army. The Bosnian soldiers, in their most successful advance of the 31-month-old war, seized at least 75 square miles of land east of Bihac, but have since lost almost all of it to a Serbian counterattack.\nInitially, United Nations officials were hesitant as to how to respond to the Serbs' counterattack, because it could be argued that it was a reasonable response to a military setback in a war.\nBut the use of napalm and cluster bombs against civilians and the relentless tightening of the Serbian noose around Bihac eventually tipped Mr. Akashi toward calling for NATO action.\nStill, he acknowledged today that the United Nations position as peacekeeper in a war remained awkward. \"We are in a very sensitive and delicate situation,\" he said. \"If we did not act, we would be viewed as incompetent and spineless. But if we acted too vigorously, we could provoke an escalation leading to tragic consequences. We try to tread this narrow path.\"\nIn the past, treading this path had led to conflict between United Nations officers preoccupied by their soldiers' security on the ground and American-led efforts to use NATO air power decisively to help bring peace to Bosnia. At Udbina today these tensions were partly overcome, but the basic tension remains.\nThe Bosnian Government welcomed the raid and called for more NATO action to halt the attacks on the Bihac area, where about 180,000 Muslims live.\n\"All we ask from the United Nations and NATO is to protect our borders,\" said the Bosnian Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic. \"The Serbs are attacking across the Croatian border from a United Nations protected area. Their tanks are effectively enjoying United Nations protection while Bosnia still has an arms embargo imposed on it. This is completely absurd.\"\nRenegade Muslim forces loyal to a businessman, Fikret Abdic, have joined Serbian nationalist troops in the attack on the V Corps, advancing from the north toward their former stronghold of Velika Kladusa while other Serbian units have attacked from the east and south.\n[ \"None of the problems around Bihac have been resolved by today's air strike,\" said one United Nations official in Sarajevo, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. \"The military assessment is that the attacks on the Bihac enclave will continue.\"\n[ The official said United Nations military analysts expected the Serbs and rebel Muslims fighting in their ranks to try to cut the Bihac enclave into three pieces and bottle up the Bosnian Army's V Corps inside the Bihac safe area.\n[ There was no talk of NATO air strikes to stop the ground or artillery attacks on Bihac, he said. ]\nThe NATO warplanes used today flew from bases in Italy and on the British aircraft carrier Invincible in the Adriatic. They were supported by air-to-air refueling aircraft, American airborne command and control aircraft known as Awacs and reconnaissance planes.\nIt is notable that because the air raid today did not take place in Bosnia, it did not involve Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose, the commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia. Of late, General Rose has been a persistent opponent of the use of NATO air power against the Serbs.\nThe NATO raid came as the war throughout Bosnia intensified, with a Bosnian Serb missile attack on the city government building in the capital, Sarajevo, heavy sniper fire throughout that city and Bosnian Serb shelling of the northern city of Tuzla. \"CHRONOLOGY: Balkans and NATO: A Test of Power\"\nBy Reuters\nJULY 1992: NATO agrees to use naval force in Adriatic to assess compliance with United Nations sanctions on Yugoslavia.

Why the new virus attacks the lung, not the kidneys, is a mystery.\nA parasite rarely known to affect humans causes the largest outbreak of waterborne illness in this country.\nA toxin produced by an intestinal bacterium contaminates undercooked hamburger, causing kidneys to fail and killing several children.\nThese are not the myths of science fiction.\nAll occurred in the United States last year, severely straining the resources of health departments and showing that vulnerability to new infections has never been greater. In addition, in a number of instances recently, bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics.\nThe lung disease was produced by a new hantavirus, and it has been fatal in more than half of the 72 cases that are known to have occurred since it was first detected in New Mexico last summer.\nThe parasite, cryptosporidium, contaminated the water supply of Milwaukee, producing prolonged diarrhea in 400,000 people and putting 4,400 in the hospital.\nThe toxin, produced by E. coli bacteria, infected not only people who ate the hamburgers but probably some who ate salad cut with the same utensils used on the meat, and some who came into contact with those who were infected. It made more than 500 people in the Seattle area sick and led to kidney failure in at least 29. Four died, all children.\nElsewhere, a new strain of cholera swept across India and Bangladesh, spread to Thailand and threatened other parts of Asia, infecting hundreds of thousands of people and killing thousands. Many experts believe cholera is likely to move from Latin America, where in 1991 it struck for the first time since 1895, into the Caribbean in the not-too-distant future.\nNot so long ago, Government officials and medical leaders all but pronounced the end of infectious diseases as a major public health problem. These striking examples of new and emerging diseases prove that prediction wrong. They join a list that includes, among others, AIDS, legionnaire's disease, Lyme disease, Lassa fever and bleeding and fever from the Ebola and Marburg viruses. Some were unknown or minor hazards only a decade or two ago. Others increased significantly in incidence over the last 20 years. Still others threaten to become bigger hazards in the near future.\nSome new and emerging infections are part of the poorly understood natural cycles of epidemics. Others reflect the rapidly changing spectrum of infections that has accompanied population growth, expanding poverty, urban migration, increasing international travel and rapidly changing technology.\nInfectious diseases are the leading cause of death in the world. The toll is swelling as a result of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, which is estimated to have infected 14 million people, mainly in Africa and Asia, since it was first recognized in 1981. By 2000, experts estimate, the number infected will be 40 million.\nYet overconfidence about infectious diseases has weakened public health systems in this country and elsewhere, jeopardizing their ability to detect and prevent new and old ones. What the United States needs now, a new Federal report says, is an infusion of up to $125 million a year to carry out a plan to provide the vigilance and rapid response needed to contain infections.\nThe single most important weapon in any country's defense against infections is its disease surveillance system. Surveillance is used to characterize disease patterns by time, place and person, to detect epidemics, to evaluate prevention and control programs and project future health care needs.\n\"Whatever shape health care reform takes in this country, surveillance will be the key to the meaningful evaluation of new programs,\" said the new Federal report, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a Federal agency in Atlanta.\nThe sudden, unexpected appearance of AIDS shocked health officials into a belated recognition of the need for improved surveillance and an awareness that such vigilance might serve as an early warning system to prevent new and emerging infections from becoming public health disasters. But the report said, \"The ability to detect what is new or emerging depends on the capacity to identify and track the routine as well as the unusual.\"\nSuccessful surveillance hinges on the accuracy of statistical analyses, and they hinge on the accuracy of reports that doctors and hospitals are supposed to mail to local health departments about specified infections. But many diseases are notoriously underreported in the United States.\nSurveillance also relies on an effective laboratory system. Microbiologists can be the first to detect genetic changes in organisms that could signal an impending outbreak of antibiotic-resistant infections. Microbiologists can also be the first to detect known diseases that have spread to new geographic areas and populations. Laboratories can be vital for the early detection of exotic microbial agents that might be used for biological warfare or terrorist activities.\nSurprisingly, the report said, no Federal resources are provided to state and local health departments to support the national disease reporting system. And other parts of surveillance systems have been weakened by budget cuts.\nAlthough widespread misuse of antibiotic drugs has led to the emergence of resistant bacteria, the magnitude of the problem is unknown because no national system exists to monitor it.\nMany outbreaks from infections that are transmitted through contaminated food and water go unrecognized or are detected late because current disease monitoring systems are inadequate to confront the present and future challenges. Twelve states have no monitoring system at all for surveying foodborne or waterborne diseases, the report said.\nOne of the most astonishing discoveries in recent years is that a bacterium, Helicobacter pylori, can cause ulcers and other stomach ailments including possibly some forms of stomach cancer. (The same bacterium was noted in the stomach in the early part of the century but was widely ignored.) Last February, the bacterium's causative role for ulcers was given widespread acceptance by a Government-appointed panel of experts that made antibiotics a required component of ulcer treatment.\nFew had suspected that ulcers were caused by an infection. But H. pylori turns out to be just one of a small but growing list of microbes that have been found to produce what had previously been classified as noninfectious diseases.\nScientists have now determined that the hepatitis C virus, for instance, is a leading cause of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. They are exploring a link between the papillomavirus and cervical cancer. And scientists in the United States and South Africa have reported evidence linking a microbe, Chlamydia pneumoniae, to coronary artery disease. C. pneumoniae, which is also known as TAWR, is a common cause of pneumonia, bronchitis and sinusitis. The findings suggest but do not prove a link between C. pneumoniae infections and atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of heart attacks.\nScientists are also exploring the role of microbes in multiple sclerosis, Sjogren syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, Kawasaki disease and insulin-dependent diabetes.\nBut such searches can be disappointing. From time to time, scientists have reported hints that one or another microbe causes coronary artery disease and rheumatoid arthritis. But proof is lacking for any microbial cause of heart attacks and arthritis.\nSaying that the concept of separating domestic from international health is outdated, the report suggested a number of measures to guard public health, including these:\n*Improving communications between health officials in countries throughout the world so they can share more information about trends in infections.\n*Creating a global network of scientific centers.\n*Improving surveillance by strengthening and creating long-term collaborations and partnerships with practicing doctors, microbiologists, public agencies, universities, private industry and communities.\n*Organizing a network of doctors, emergency rooms, laboratories, medical examiners, travel medicine clinics, veterinarians and others to report certain problems like influenza and drug-resistant infections as sentinel surveillance systems.\n*Using modern computing techniques to speed reporting of diseases from a doctor's office to a health department.\n*Using aerial photography and satellite imaging techniques to investigate environmental sources of infection and formulate effective control measures.\n*Seeking to discover the role of insects or other vectors in transmitting diseases that are not yet known to be spread in such fashion.\n*Teaching more about public health and the basic principles of surveillance to medical students and young doctors.\nSurveillance is hampered by the lack of rapid and accurate diagnostic tests for microbes like Mycoplasma, which causes respiratory illness, and by the lack of technicians who are proficient in applying the many tests that are available.\nIn both the Seattle and Milwaukee outbreaks, lack of training in the testing necessary for detection resulted in delayed recognition of outbreaks, the centers' report said.\nAt a time when most budgets are being cut, some see appeals for more money for infectious disease surveillance as self-serving. Yet, expensive as it is, prevention is often the cheapest medicine. Penny-pinching could be enormously costly in human suffering and dollars."}, {"text": "Fighting Rages as NATO Debates How to Protect Bosnian Enclave\n1994-11-25T05:00:00.000Z\nFierce fighting raged today around the Muslim enclave of Bihac in northwestern Bosnia when Serbian forces pursued a steady advance toward the center of the town and NATO allies failed to agree on how to save it.\nIn a move to discourage retaliatory bombings by NATO, Serbs immobilized about 200 United Nations troops and observers around Sarajevo and detained about 50 Canadian troops north of the capital. The tactic, used by the Serbs in the past when they faced air strikes, left the peacekeepers virtual hostages.\nLieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose, the commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia, said the peacekeepers did not face harsh conditions and were being detained mainly as bargaining chips.\nHe said the Serbs \"are terrified that we'll leave suddenly in the middle of the night, and the next thing they will have is air strikes on their heads.\"\nThe United Nations commander called the Serbian advance on Bihac \"a very grave development, which we have to act upon,\" but he declined to say what action he would recommend to NATO. [ Page A16. ]\nAt an emergency meeting of the NATO Council in Brussels, envoys failed to agree today on how to stop the Serbian offensive, which NATO is technically bound to curb because the Serbs have already encroached on the Bihac \"safe area,\" made up of the town and its immediate surroundings.\nClaire Grimes, a spokeswoman for the United Nations in Zagreb, said Bosnian Serbs advancing from the southwest had reached a point about one mile from the center of Bihac, a town of about 45,000 people whose recent fortunes have belied the \"safe area\" status it was accorded by the United Nations last year.\n\"After a brief lull early in the day, there has been heavy fighting inside the safe zone, to the southwest of the city and on Debeljaca hill,\" Ms. Grimes said.\nThe Prime Minister of Bosnia's Muslim-led Government, Haris Silajdzic, said Debeljaca, a steep 1,800-foot hill inside the safe area, had been taken by the Serbs, but there was no confirmation of that from United Nations officials.\n\"The Serbs are attacking with tank fire and artillery fire and have taken the hill,\" Mr. Silajdzic said. \"We have appealed to NATO to act immediately to stop these attacks.\"\nNATO planes bombed Serbian targets for three straight days earlier this week in retaliation for air strikes and other attacks on the Bihac pocket that violated United Nations demands.\nIn essence, the NATO debate today centered on whether to break out of a cycle of messy compromises in the 31-month-old Bosnian war by using more extensive force against the Serbs, or to settle at Bihac for the inconclusive arrangements that have prevailed at other Muslim enclaves attacked by Serbian forces.\nIn a strikingly low-key statement given the gravity of the situation on the ground, NATO said today that it \"supports ongoing diplomatic efforts to create an effective stabilization in and around Bihac, and would be ready to consider how to assist the United Nations in implementing those objectives once they have been agreed.\"\nConcerted use of NATO force, favored by the Clinton Administration if the Serbs do not stop their offensive at once, could put the United Nations peacekeeping operation at risk, and perhaps also jeopardize its relations with Russia, which is sympathetic to the Serbs.\nBut another compromise like those that prevailed at Srebrenica, Zepa and Gorazde -- other Muslim enclaves that were ultimately rendered powerless by Serbian attacks -- might merely prolong the war by suggesting that the alliance lacks resolve.\nFormally, the United States today proposed extending the Bihac safe area by about four miles; its complete demilitarization, including the guarantee of safe passage out for the Muslim-led Bosnian troops, and an ultimatum to nationalist Serb forces to withdraw from the safe area or face air strikes, Western officials said.\nBut the proposal met with resistance because France, the largest contributor to the United Nations force, with about 6,000 men, wanted to know what troops would police this newly extended safe area, which is remote from the United Nations military headquarters in Sarajevo.\nBeyond that debate, however, a deeper one raged today between the United States, Western European powers and the United Nations military commanders in Bosnia, the Western officials said.\nShould NATO use force again, the United States argued that it should be a wide-ranging NATO air attack against the Bosnian Serbs that would include targets outside the Bihac area, one senior official said.\n\"We don't want to carpet-bomb Pale,\" he said, in a reference to the self-styled capital of the Bosnian Serbs, 20 miles southeast of Sarajevo.\n\"But we would not be averse to seeing a fuel dump or an ammunition dump go up somewhere, because we believe it would focus the Serbs' minds. And we don't believe they are crazy enough to harm the United Nations peacekeepers.\"\nThe justification for such action would be that the Serbs have encroached on a safe area and threatened United Nations troops there, so hitting any military target likely to reduce the Serbs' ability to wage war is justified.\nGeneral Rose went to Pale today for talks with Bosnian Serb leaders despite the fact that Bosnian Serb forces were effectively holding over 250 United Nations peacekeepers hostage after NATO bombings this week of an air base in the Serb-held region of Croatia and of Bosnian Serb surface-to-air missile systems northeast of Bihac.\nAbout 200 United Nations peacekeepers from France, Russia and Ukraine were being held today at nine weapons-collection sites around Sarajevo, United Nations officials said. Nationalist Serb fighters took another 50 or so Canadian soldiers prisoner near Visoko, a town just north of Sarajevo.\nLoosely guarded by peacekeeping troops, the weapons-collection sites were set up by the United Nations in February when it decreed a weapons-exclusion zone with a 12-mile radius around Sarajevo. NATO threatened then to destroy all of the nationalist Serbs' artillery and tanks around the city if they were not removed.\n\"They are effectively hostages,\" General Rose said, referring to the peacekeeping troops. \"It is a reaction that we have seen before by the Serbs who are on the weapon-collection sites and in the checkpoints,\" the general said.\n\"They would rather we stayed than left,\" he added. \"It's their sort of life-insurance policy.\"\nThe talks at Pale were aimed at exploring Bosnian Serb proposals for a demilitarization of the Bihac pocket and a cease-fire there, United Nations officials said.\nIn effect, General Rose chose to speak to the Bosnian Serbs' political leader, Radovan Karadzic, against the background of an explicit threat from him. Earlier this week, Mr. Karadzic wrote to General Rose and the top United Nations official here, Yasushi Akashi, saying:\n\"If a NATO attack happens, it will mean that further relations between yourselves and our side will be rendered impossible because we would have to treat you as our enemies. All United Nations Protection Force personnel as well as NATO personnel would be treated as our enemies.\"\nIt is this kind of threat that General Rose and Mr. Akashi are inclined to take seriously. The Clinton Administration, with no American troops on the ground in Bosnia, is more inclined to dismiss it as saber-rattling that would quickly be exposed as meaningless by the full force of NATO air power.\nThe possibilities of a cease-fire in Bihac seemed remote. Although United Nations officials said Mr. Silajdzic initially expressed interest in the idea today during a meeting with General Rose, the Bosnian Prime Minister later dismissed the Bosnian Serb offer as a camouflage.\n\"This was obviously an instrument to try to calm down the situation internationally so that the Serbs could advance more,\" Mr. Silajdzic said.\nA small convoy carrying food for a beleaguered United Nations battalion of Bangladeshi peacekeepers was allowed to pass into the Bihac pocket today by the Croatian Serbs, but by nightfall there was no confirmation that it had reached the peacekeepers' headquarters in Coralici.\nGeneral conditions for the 180,000 people in the Bihac area remained dire, a United Nations official said.\nFor the Bosnian Government, the dilemma of a potential cease-fire and demilitarization is that it would shift the balance of power in western Bosnia, just as the balance of power was shifted in eastern Bosnia by Serbian offensives on the Muslim enclaves of Srebrenica and Gorazde.\nUp to now Bihac has been a military stronghold held by the V Corps of the Bosnian Army, with 15,000 men under arms. Demilitarization would leave the enclave a powerless pocket of civilians, totally dependent on international protection and surrounded by Serbs in Bosnia and the Krajina area of Croatia.\nSimilar powerless pockets now exist in Gorazde, Zepa and Srebrenica, ready to crumble if ever the United Nations forces leave.\nBut some United Nations officials, as well as the Russian Government, argue that such a result in Bihac is no more than the Bosnian Government deserves after initiating the latest fighting in the area last month. An offensive eastward by the Bosnian Government displaced about 10,000 Bosnian Serb civilians before the Serbs' forces counterattacked.\n\"The Muslim side launched its latest offensive with the clear intention of involving NATO and other third forces in fighting on its side, achieving the lifting of the arms embargo and, of course, ensuring air strikes,\" the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, said today.\nThe American view is starkly different.\nThe Clinton Administration holds that Bosnian Serb forces should now face some retribution after hounding hundreds of thousands of Muslim civilians from their homes, putting many in concentration camps, carrying out mass executions, rejecting an international peace settlement accepted by the Bosnian Government and showing a repeated willingness to defy the international community with force."}, {"text": "Young Criminals' Prey: Usually Young\n1994-12-01T05:00:00.000Z\nWilfredo Feliciano remembers he was wearing his Nathan Hale Junior High School gym shirt on the evening of Dec. 8, 1993, and he remembers how easily the box-cutter sliced through it. His attackers, a 15-year-old and a 16-year-old who lived in the same Brooklyn housing project as Wilfredo, didn't stop when they had cut apart the shirt.\nAs he struggled, screaming, into the lobby of his building, a slash of the razor-sharp cutter opened an enormous wound across his back. He felt the sting and the blood, and then he felt the blade slicing into his forearms.\n\"I felt like I was already dead,\" said Wilfredo, who was 14 at the time. \"I didn't know what to do. My muscles were, like, gone. I felt like I was watching a movie about another kid being cut. It was kind of confusing.\"\nHe remembers with clarity, though, how the youth with the blade finished the job, with two final stabs, one puncturing his back just below his heart, the other just missing a kidney.\n\"I thought killing me was something they were willing to do,\" he said.\nYoung criminals strike all age groups and emotionally scar parents, spouses, siblings and friends. But experts agree that most victims of juvenile crime are, like Wilfredo, children themselves.\nThe degree to which American youths encounter peril at the hands of other American youths is reflected in 1992 Justice Department satistics: 55 percent of all crimes against people 12 to 19 years old were committed by people in the same age group. Juvenile attackers also accounted for 64 percent of all gang assaults, gang rapes and gang robberies committed against the young.\nAnd the young victims are disproportionately black. In 1992, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 1,240 blacks under the age of 18 were murdered nationwide, as compared with 1,103 whites in that age group, and blacks make up only about 12 percent of the population.\nMany young victims are assaulted, or even killed, at school; many have to be moved to another school or another town. Many are terrorized in their neighborhoods. And young victims often become young offenders as, in the words of one expert, \"their definition of self-defense broadens.\"\n\"You work with children exposed to serious levels of violence, both those who commit it and those who are victims of it, and you come to realize that the behavior of many of them reflects a new, awful way of looking at the world,\" said Dr. Beverly Coleman Miller, an internist who runs a program in Washington for people who have witnessed violent crime. \"I call it terminally ill behavior. They are convinced their lives are worthless, and so they are making all the choices of someone who is preparing for death.\"\nThose choices have grim ramifications. From 1987 to 1991, the number of juveniles arrested on murder charges climbed by 85 percent across the nation, four times the rate of increase for adults. In the same period, arrests on charges of robbery, assault, rape and other violent crime rose by 50 percent among juveniles, double the increase among adults.\nThe costs of the crimes are measured in many ways: in property stolen, in the $70,000 a year, for instance, that the New York State Division for Youth spends to incarcerate a juvenile. And there is the human price. Other than children, teachers are victims more often than any group, a distinction that disheartens the very ones who may be best positioned to help young people. Immigrants, as well, have become targets in increasing numbers. And then there are the victims' friends and family members who also suffer.\nAs they fight for justice as well as their own recovery, victims of juvenile crime may face a disorienting, often enervating array of challenges, not the least of which is pursuing prosecutions in Family Court, where the crimes adjudicated cover the full spectrum, from stealing milk money to killing someone. Trials can take months, victims are allowed limited participation in the proceedings, and the defendants and victims often find themselves seated next to each other in crowded waiting rooms.\nTeachers feel shame for the rage they come to harbor against children, however briefly, and many wind up abandoning the vocation. The crimes, too, can make racists of people, who may then come to hate themselves for their bigotry.\n\"Often the first response is that this couldn't have happened,\" said Karen S. Burstein, a former Family Court judge in Brooklyn who was an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for State Attorney General this fall. \"Then comes the great trauma. People's expectations with respect to children are so defeated. Violence has been done to them physically. But violence has also been done to their worldview.\" The Teacher One Punch Redirects a Career\nKenneth Linn was not there for the start of classes at Junior High School 118 in the Bronx this fall. He had become one more teacher lost to New York City, one more cost exacted by juvenile crime. He had quit.\nMr. Linn decided he had had enough after a 17-year-old came out of nowhere one morning last January and unloaded a devastating punch, breaking his jaw and cutting his face, as Mr. Linn was walking to his first class of the day.\n\"If the punch was slightly higher, it might have taken my eye out,\" said Mr. Linn, 35, who had given up studying in the seminary to become a special education teacher.\nHis bitterness is only deepened by his memory of lying sprawled on the ground that morning, at 179th Street and Arthur Avenue, as students walked by, not one reaching to help him up.\nAmong many adult victims of juvenile crime, rage against a lone attacker is only the first phase. Later, the anger may fester to warp the victim's perception of all young people, violent or not. Teachers in particular are vulnerable to such violence, and to the indiscriminate fury. In the 1993-94 school year in New York City public schools, students committed 4,011 violent crimes against teachers or other staff members.\nSome teachers are satisfied to move to safer schools. Others, like Mr. Linn, quit outright, leaving behind their commitment to the underprivileged. He now teaches at a suburban school on Long Island.\nMr. Linn filed charges against his attacker and testified before a grand jury. The only explanation he could arrive at for the crime was that the 17-year-old had simply wanted to display arbitrary power. Prosecuted as an adult, the youth, Allan Mason, ultimately pleaded guilty to a single charge of second-degree assault and was sentenced in February to six months in prison.\n\"Maybe I'll go back to the seminary, be ordained some day,\" Mr. Linn said. \"They say you have to have a good knowledge of the world, and, boy, have I got it. But my knowledge of the world has started a hardness creeping in on me, and that hardness is an evil. My theology is that what brings us together is holy, and that what separates us is evil.\" The Teen-Ager Sleeping Now With a Knife\nWilfredo Feliciano's attackers had mumbled something vague -- something they had made up about his owing them money, Wilfredo said -- before they pounced on him as he and a friend stood outside his building at Gowanus Houses, a project in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn. The friend fled as the attackers chased Wilfredo into the building, only to see him slip from their grasp when a neighbor opened her apartment door and allowed Wilfredo to escape.\nBut that did not end his ordeal. Later came the dozens of stitches and the forced inactivity, as well as the anger, the depression and the lasting fear.\nThe slashing wound up separating Wilfredo from almost everything he knew.\n\"They ruined my life -- period,\" Wilfredo said of his attackers, who were both sentenced to at least a year of incarceration. \"I had to forget everybody. I had to leave all my friends. I had to lead a different life, be a totally different person. I used to be open about my feelings. Now, everything is just stuck in. There is so much anger and frustration inside I don't know how to take it out. I won't trust anyone, and, I don't know, I'm kind of afraid of everything.\"\nThere were anger and shame. He fought with his mother and his relatives. He had flashbacks, and he slept with a knife. He briefly moved out of his building, at 417 Baltic Avenue, to live with his godparents in Westchester County, but even there he took the knife to bed with him.\n\"His depression was so great he came into my office and literally could not move,\" said Jorge Cordero, an art teacher at Nathan Hale Junior High School.\nWilfredo had been an honor student and had won several community service awards while at Nathan Hale. But the attack forced him to transfer to a Catholic school in Park Slope, St. Francis Xavier, where for a time he was unable to concentrate on his studies.\nBut with counseling from teachers, principals and the Victim Services office at Family Court, Wilfredo came to thrive at St. Francis Xavier, and he was later accepted at LaSalle Academy in Manhattan under an alumni sponsorship program.\nOne who worked with Wilfredo was the Rev. Ed Duran, the pastor at St. Francis and an adjunct professor of counseling at St. John's University. \"It's hard to put the fear, the hurt, away,\" he said, \"especially in the projects, where there is the strong sense that everything will come back to you, come back to burn you. My heart goes out to the kids who don't have the support network, the base of character, that Wilfredo had.\"\nThat character is still tested daily.\n\"How can anyone expect me to feel safe?\" asked Wilfredo, glancing out the seventh-floor window of his family's apartment. \"Just because a lot of good things happened doesn't mean I'm going to forget about everything that has taken place. I'm still left with that -- the memory and the pain. I live looking behind my shoulder. I don't see that ever changing in my life.\" The Immigrant A Beating Plants The Seeds of Hate\nYoung as they are, juvenile criminals can be extraordinarily calculating. They single out victims, plan assaults and carry out elaborate extortion schemes. And more and more, the prey are people like Prabia Dahr, a native of Bangladesh -- immigrants whom young criminals see as low-risk targets.\n\"They know they don't speak the language,\" said Maria Curran, a prosecutor in Manhattan, describing why young criminals choose immigrants. \"They believe they won't pursue prosecutions. They suspect the immigrants themselves might be here illegally and thus don't want anything to do with the police.\"\nMr. Dahr, 40, became one of the many immigrant victims last March 7, just outside his door in his Manhattan apartment building, at 496 West 133d Street. By his account, another tenant, who wanted Mr. Dahr's apartment for herself, had marshaled a half-dozen 15-year-olds and had them beat Mr. Dahr savagely -- boys he had said hello to before. \"They shouted, 'Kill the Indian!' and 'Why are you still here?' \" he said. They broke his glasses and opened wounds on his face with their fists and feet.\n\"I got the key in the door one night, and then I was kicked,\" recalled Mr. Dahr, who moved to the United States by himself in 1986 and took a job as a teacher. The boys took his money, he said, and at one point during the beating a knife was produced. But he managed to get away and race across the street into another building, where he pounded on doors on five floors before a young girl allowed him in.\n\"They were still screaming as they came up the stairs behind me,\" he said of the boys.\nMr. Dahr pursued the case through Family Court. One attacker pleaded guilty to robbery and was sentenced to probation. Another also pleaded guilty to robbery and was placed in a detention home; he was to be held a minimum of six months. The tenant who Mr. Dahr believes was behind the incident was not prosecuted.\nHis attackers were black and Hispanic and used ethnic slurs, Mr. Dahr said, and now he finds himself stereotyping others, drawing conclusions based on race. It disturbs him, he said. But he cannot pretend he can shake it, and it makes him feel humiliated all over again.\n\"I was not a racist before this,\" he said. \"But I have started to hate. To hate certain children. I'm sorry. It's true.\" The Mother Days of Rage In Family Court\nAlready wrestling with a range of wrenching emotions, victims of juvenile crime often encounter a host of frustrations as they look for justice in Family Court.\nYoung criminals convicted of murder are incarcerated for as little as five years. The courtrooms are crowded, and the trials are nightmares of erratic scheduling and intimate brushes with the criminals. Victims have no right by law to speak at a sentencing and are never told if or when the offenders have been released.\nFamily members often cannot even get into the courtroom, a place that can offer strange cruelties. One woman had to watch the boy who killed her son testify in court in the clothes he had taken from her son.\nAnd, most maddening to many, there is a strong likelihood that the young person who beat or robbed or stabbed or even killed someone will never be prosecuted. Of all the cases in which a juvenile is arrested in New York City, the Corporation Counsel's office winds up declining to prosecute 40 percent, the prosecutors unable to go forward without complaining witnesses, who may fear reprisal.\n\"For the victims, the crimes are just the beginnings of the odyssey,\" said Michelle Rowland, a veteran prosecutor in Manhattan. \"Frankly, victims of crimes by juveniles are required to be very brave people.\"\nIlona Fares, of Coney Island, had the courage, and she was in court every day during the trial of the 10-year-old who shot her 14-year-old son, Jeffrey, in the head in 1991 in the younger boy's home in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. Jeffrey was dead on arrival at Kings County Hospital. In the courtroom, she said, she witnessed a miscarriage of justice.\nMrs. Fares never got to speak on her son's behalf. She said the young defendant's family was never punished or reprimanded for allowing a child to have access to a gun in the home.\nThe 10-year-old told the court that the gun had gone off accidentally as the boys played on a couch. He wound up pleading guilty to criminally negligent homicide and has since been released from custody.\n\"I wanted to scream at them that they were all so stupid,\" Mrs. Fares said of the Family Court judge, the prosecutors and the boy's family. \"Justice wasn't done. There is no morality. There is no control. It feels like everything in the world has run rampant.\" The Father A Sad Embrace, Then Acceptance\nMaribel Feliciano, a sophomore at Fashion Industries High School in Manhattan, was on a subway train heading home to Brooklyn from classes one day in 1991 when five girls she did not know approached her. They liked her earrings, they told her. Then they tried to tear them from her ears.\nMaribel resisted. A struggle ensued, until one of the girls pulled out a knife and stabbed her in the neck. Maribel was dead on arrival at the hospital, a victim of another senseless killing that would lead the 6 o'clock news.\nA 15-year-old girl was arrested. There was a trial, and a conviction, and at the sentencing Maribel's father, Miguel Feliciano, did an extraordinary thing. He embraced the killer's father.\nFor all the rage provoked by children who carry out unthinkable crimes, there are victims who allow the violence to transform them in constructive ways. Mr. Feliciano is one of those. The embrace, he said, wasn't about forgiveness, but about loneliness and sadness.\n\"All of us are left not knowing whom to blame,\" Mr. Feliciano said. \"I blamed myself. I blamed the other child. I blamed society. I blamed the judicial system. But there are only victims. Everywhere.\"\nFor Mr. Feliciano, a 57-year-old housing inspector for the city's Inspector General's office (he is not related to the Wilfredo Feliciano portrayed in this article), Maribel's murder has led to a sort of ministry. He has testified before the City Council's Youth Committee and worked on legislation in Albany. He goes to funeral parlors in Queens and Brooklyn to console victims. He works individually with a dozen boys and girls in East New York.\n\"I call Maribel a bridge,\" he said. \"I don't know how this will strike others. I, too, still see my child surrounded by a pack of wolves. I felt the shock, the frustration, the incredible anger. But there is acceptance. It is the last station.\" When Trouble Starts Young\nMAY 15: The violent life of Shaul Linyear of Brooklyn, a murderer at 16.\nMAY 16: The face of violence: A 10-year-old predator in Detroit.\nMAY 17: A gallery of 28 New York City youths facing murder charges.\nMAY 18: An Iowa killing spotlights a violent trend among young whites.\nTODAY: The human cost: Portraits of victims in New York City.\nTOMORROW: LIving in fear of the young, with violence at the corner."}, {"text": "Chinese Military's Business Empire Puts Profits Into Commerce, Not Arms\n1994-05-24T05:00:00.000Z\nEver since the People's Liberation Army went into business more than a decade ago, Western intelligence agencies have been concerned that profits from its vast commercial enterprises would go toward the purchase of tanks, missiles and fighter aircraft.\nBut over the last two years, the agencies have come to a new conclusion: China's military enterprises are pyramiding their successes, plowing profits into new and bigger commercial enterprises, hotels, truck and shipping companies -- even discos.\nAs a result of this new analysis, assumptions about the pace of China's military modernization, its ambitions as a regional military power and the true size of its overall military spending are being scaled back, a number of Western analysts say.\nWhile this assessment may provide a measure of comfort to neighbors who fear China's growing military power, its military goals may not be totally non-threatening, especially when it comes to disputed areas in the South China Sea, where a number of other Asian governments are vying for oil exploration rights. Profits Not Going to Arms\nThe new analysis is significant in assessing China's overall military strength, Western analysts say, because profits from the ventures are either being invested in new commercial activity or are being spent on the welfare of the military units that control businesses that sprang up in the era of economic reforms after decades of \"starvation\" military budgets.\n\"The answer to whether they are plowing back these profits into more bombs, rockets, ships and guns is no,\" said David Shambaugh, a China scholar at the University of London who has recently completed a study of Chinese military spending.\nEven the rapidly declining revenues from overseas sales of Silkworm anti-ship missiles, F-7 fighters and ballistic missiles appear to be financing science and technology research academies, not military procurement, the analysts say.\nIn China's booming coastal provinces, military commercialism has produced a generation of top military officers who are more likely to have driven a newly purchased Mercedes-Benz in the last year than a tank or armored personnel carrier. Source of Corruption\nAt the same time, Western officials say, big military businesses have also led to corruption, the dimensions of which have not been reported by China's leadership even as they give wide publicity to an anti-corruption campaign in civilian businesses.\n\"From China's standpoint,\" a Western diplomat here said, \"one of the problems is that the military is too busy making money to think about national defense.\"\nThe explosion of growth in China's military industries has also raised the profile of its exports to the United States, including everything from assault rifles to toys to toilet seats. Some members of Congress now advocate imposing penalties on China's military industries to punish China for its record on human rights, an idea that some China specialists warn would be counterproductive. Specialists argue that because the military is expected to be the key institution for stability in China after the death of Deng Xiaoping, the senior leader, punishing military industries is fraught with problems of definition and practicality. Trying to Bring Order\nIn response to this shift toward commercialism in the armed forces, President Jiang Zemin and his top military adviser, Adm. Liu Huaqing, have since last fall tried to bring order to the military's corporate structure, and they have been joined by a number of other top Chinese military leaders. Still, it remains to be seen whether a new emphasis on training and readiness will reimpose sufficient discipline so Communist Party leaders can maintain stability in the ranks.\n\"The commercialization of the P.L.A. has had a very deleterious effect on readiness and training,\" Mr. Shambaugh asserts.\nBut prosperity is well received among the troops, most of the analysts agree. For the first time in decades, there is meat on the table for soldiers, who were forced like other Chinese to scrounge for rice husks and eat grass soup during the deprivation years of the 1950's and during the Cultural Revolution, from 1966 to 1976.\n\"I have actually overheard an officer criticizing a superior for being too interested in taking money from commercial activity and turning it over to the central Government,\" a Western diplomat said. \"He told him he should be more concerned about the living standards of his comrades.\" Making Many Products\nToday, China's military runs a pharmaceutical empire with earnings of $1 billion a year; it produces satellite television dishes and cellular phones as well as food, clothing, trucks, boats, motorcycles and contact lenses. In Shanghai, the city's hottest disco, JJ's, is a joint venture between the military, which owns the building, and a Hong Kong investor. The cavernous warehouse throbs each night under a constellation of strobe lights while a prostitution trade takes place outside.\n\"Companies are putting more profit into dual-use civilian production: motorcycles instead of fighter aircraft and commercial space launches instead of military rockets,\" a Western diplomat said. \"Chinese weapons are not in high demand.\"\nAt the Chengdu Aircraft Company in south-central Sichuan Province, for instance, the production line for F-7 fighter aircraft scarcely has customers for the dozen or so units it produces each year.\n\"The production line is still producing fighters, but they are just lining them up out there on the ramp with no one to sell them to, except for the few that go to Pakistan or Bangladesh,\" said a recent visitor to the plant. \"The majority of the work force is involved with making three different varieties of motorcycles, and this is just to make money.\" Making Airliner Nose Cones\nThe factory's military managers tell visitors that 70 percent of their income comes from the motorcycle business and most of the rest from a joint venture with McDonnell Douglas to produce nose sections for the MD-80 commercial airliner.\n\"They have been making those nose sections for the MD-80 for five years,\" a Western diplomat said. \"They float them down the Yangtze River and ship them back to Long Beach, where they are fitted onto the MD-80's that are sold around the world.\"\nBut the profits from these commercial ventures are not going into the operations, maintenance or procurement budgets of the military, Western analysts say.\n\"It is not benefiting the military in the direct sense a lot of people used to think and some who still do,\" the diplomat said.\nIn testimony to Congress, the Central Intelligence Agency estimated last year that the proceeds of China's military enterprises had reached $5 billion annually.\nMr. Shambaugh, the China scholar, estimated that the figure could be as high as $10 billion, but added, \"I don't think anyone, including the military, knows how much they make on commercial activities.\" Official Figure Not Believed\nChina's military spending level has long been a mystery. After two decades in which spending actually declined and forces atrophied, China's officially acknowledged military budget has increased by more than 10 percent a year since 1989, to about $7 billion.\nBut a Western diplomat said of Beijing's officially announced budget: \"Nobody believes the figures they give on defense.\"\nMany analysts agree that a more realistic estimate is $20 billion to $40 billion. That is less than one-tenth of the United States military budget and on a par with Japanese military spending, but with three million people under arms, China's greatest costs are supporting them.\n\"Even after the increases, we are just able to maintain the minimum standards of living for the forces,\" Xu Xin, former deputy chief of staff of the military, said in a recent interview.\nIn November, as get-rich fever seemed to be getting out of control in the military, President Jiang summoned the military leadership to set some rules, including a decree that said military enterprises at the lower command levels should be turned over to the civilian authorities. So far, it is uncertain how many such business have been transferred. In Business to Stay\nMr. Jiang in his decree may have been trying to bring order out of the chaos, but he also enshrined the principle that the Chinese military, at the highest levels, was in business to stay. There now are \"scores\" of power centers in the military that are consolidating their business empires, Western analysts say.\nEven Mr. Jiang's admonition to the assembled military brass sounded a contradictory note when he said the army should \"stick to the principle of building up its combat strength while engaging in production and business activities.\"\nThe President, who exercises his role as commander in chief as chairman of the Central Military Commission, told military leaders that they should rationalize their business investments in a way that reduced China's overall financial burdens and improved the living standards of troops.\n\"Ever since then, there has been a strong increase in training and conducting military exercises,\" a Western diplomat said.\nAnd in recent months, the civilian leadership has begun to enforce more strictly the retirement age for top military officers, a decision that Western analysts say will make the military more professional. A diplomat said it would also remove incentives for corruption typified by the attitude that \"if I am not going to get promoted, then I am going to get mine while I can.\" Concern Abroad Remains\nIf the new analysis of Chinese military financing means that Beijing is spending less on the military, it will probably reduce the concerns of regional powers like Japan.\nBut concern remains nonetheless. China has embarked on building up well-equipped, rapid deployment forces that could be thrown into any number of territorial disputes on China's periphery, particularly in the Taiwan Strait and over a disputed group of islands in the South China Sea called the Spratlys. There, China is forging ahead with oil exploration despite rival claims from Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei.\nAt the same time, China continues to search for relatively inexpensive weapon systems that can deliver firepower decisively in the opening stage of a conflict. To that end, its aviation design bureaus are working on a boxy prototype of a Stealth bomber, similar to the American F-117 that was so decisive against Iraq in the Persian Gulf war.\n\"They have a program,\" a Western diplomat said. The question, he added, is what they will do with it."}, {"text": "ENCOUNTERS; Crossing Cultures: The Complex Life of a Man of All Things\n1994-03-13T05:00:00.000Z\nWAS it the fact that the Persian rugs themselves were so large that contributed to the sense of a certain almost fairy tale strangeness as I waited for Feradoun Hoveyda, ambassador to the United Nations under the Shah of Iran, to re-emerge? Or was it the fact that they went from wall to wall, instead of being set in the center, so that as soon as one rug ended, defining the ending of one room, immediately another began?\nIt was only once I was sitting several rooms and rugs away from the foyer that I became aware of a frosted glass panel-- the only window that I would later remember -- through which you could see the light. It had a medieval, churchlike appearance strangely in keeping with the Persian door panels and the tapestries in the room where we sat.\nFeradoun had left me in the foyer while he went to fix our tea and I found myself busying myself looking at family portraits, pictures mostly of his two daughters, with a plethora of boats and horses. Off to the side, there were two prints in subtle muted dark tones by the painter Esteban Vicente, who had introduced me to Feradoun in a Bridgehampton summer, along with his wife Harriet and our Turkish actress friend, Shirin Devrim, with whom Feradoun would have endless arguments about whether the nature of Islam itself had to change in order for peace to come to the Middle East, Feradoun's contention that theologically Islam was still back in the 12th century, and that any changes, in order to have a lasting political effect, had to come from the Muslim theologians themselves.\nIn the labyrinthine maze of halls that we would later wander through, there was a painting of Andy Warhol by Feradoun and a painting of Feradoun by Andy Warhol, but these were merely parts of the picture of Feradoun that I would be trying to put together.\nAs Feradoun emerged with our tea tray and all sorts of chocolates, something in the quality of the adventure put me in mind of the French comic strip Tintin. Later on I would learn that Tintin was one of his \"influences.\"\nFeradoun Hoveda had been and continues to be a man of all things. In his young manhood, serving in the diplomatic corps, he had been an expatriate novelist in Paris. He had published five novels all dealing with the crossings of cultures. At the age of 22, he was put on a committee set up to draft the First Universal Declaration of Human Rights, along with his professor, Rene Cassin, who received the Nobel Prize, and Eleanor Roosevelt, a position quite odd for one who would spend a good deal of time in his adulthood in the ministry of a country hardly famous for its record in human rights. This first apprenticeship in being caught in the middle would render him capable of being in positions of compromise where most others would fear to go.\nAt the same time he was coming to know the avant-arde film makers who would take him on as a regular contributor to Les Cahiers du Cinema, a magazine that had a profound influence on contemporary cinematic theory and technique. He was becoming close to the psychoanalysts and mathematicians gathering in Paris about that time, worlds that didn't ordinarily mix.\nAfter serving a 14-year term with UNESCO, which freed him from having to deal with the Iranian government directly, he returned to Iran when the Shah came to power, moved by his promises in the areas of land reform and human rights. In the first 10 years of the Shah's regime, he worked inside Iran to spread literacy.\nWhen I asked him how it felt working so closely with the Shah, he told me that it gave him many opportunities to disagree fruitfully and to influence important decisions. \"It was only later that the Shah started to become arrogant,\" he said.\nIn 1965 he came to New York, as Ambassador to the United Nations, and there he worked on facilitating many compromises, between India and Pakistan, between the United States, the Soviet Union and China. Because of the fact that he was so often straddling several worlds, he became a sort of ideal go-between. Tie to North Vietnam\nIn a strange effort to end the war in Vietnam without losing face, President Johnson -- \"who was beginning to have nightmares and remembered that the Shah of Iran had good relations with the North Vietnamese,\" he said -- would call upon the Iranian government to establish a contact that might lead to an earlier peace, and Feradoun Hoveyda would become the secret go-between, \"the attempt only known by my brother, President Johnson, the Shah and me.\"\nThey developed a code in which Feradoun would leave cryptic messages, such as \"I went to the house and the door was slightly ajar,\" to signify that he was getting somewhere. When he needed to communicate in greater detail, he would have to go to Teheran, so that people began to question him as to why he was going there so often. He did finally make an effective contact, but Johnson was not re-elected. The action was consigned to secrecy and the war went on for another couple of years. Soon the Shah was also deposed, and Feradoun lost his position, remaining in the United States, a man without either a pension or a country, until just recently he acquired his American citizenship.\nAt the time of my visit, Feradoun had just returned from a convention in Oslo, where there was a seminar of Islamic intellectuals on human rights and Muslim land reform. He spoke of having learned there of a group of Muslims in South Africa who had actually reformed their religion to the extent that women can enter mosques and don't have to wear a chadar. This was, clearly in his mind, the direction in which the Islamic religion had to go.\n\"It is not a matter of adjusting,\" he had said to me rather firmly the first time that we met, \"but rather a matter of changing.\" It was just at the time when Rabin and Arafat had made their first moves towards peace, and optimism was in the air everywhere. Feradoun alone was withholding even the slightest modicum of either pleasure or hope, because he felt so strongly that for the rest to mean anything the religious changes must come first.\n\"Even if we believe that God is eternal, the universe he has created is not eternal,\" he continued. \"How can you say the Koran or the Zoroastra are eternal? They are only 'instructions' on how to use this universe, and they must change as the universe changes.\"\nHe paused. \"I will be 70 years old next year,\" he said, \"and I started to think about these problems at 10. Sixty years of thinking, writing and learning.I only must say that we have one battle everywhere, against fanaticism in all its forms. Any form of fanaticism -- the Pope on contraception, Farrakhan on Islam, a Hitler, fanatic Jews about being \"chosen\" -- it is hara-kiri. It is suicide.\"\nWe sat down on the pale colored sofas, very modern and simple all at once, so that even when our legs reached normally down to the floor, I had the impression that we were sitting on the floor. Or perhaps once again it was the sense of the largeness of everything else that made me feel so keenly our own smallness, as if he had put us deliberately into one of his cinematic mis-en-scenes, in a kind of far corner, like those far-off shots in the beginnings and endings of movies before the telephoto lens zooms in, when main characters give over to background, and background becomes foreground, my eyes darting from the tapestries to the resume in my lap: \"1972, elected chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism, 1973, elected Chairman of the Committee on International Disarmament Conference,\" and suddenly an award for his fourth novel, a lectureship at Bard College in \"Literature and the Neo-Realistic Revolution.\"\nFeradoun himself was a small man, as he sat at right angles to me. Or perhaps that was also only part of the illusion he so carefully made. And his face and his body were very contained.\nOnly his hands made expressive small gestures as he talked, and all within a confined circle of motion, with the rest of him keeping quite still. He was dressed rather formally, in a suit and tie, and even though we talked about intimate feelings of working, we would talk rather formally.\nThe chocolates, the tea. People have such different rhythms as they come to know one another. As Feradoun pointed out the tapestries on the wall that he had made himself, some based on the ancient Persian alphabet, I became conscious of a large sheet of blankness, so subtly turning from white to gray at the borders, that I wouldn't realize until almost the end of our visit that it was a giant movie screen, movies having been Feradoun first love, when he was a child growing up in Beirut.\nFeradoun Hoveyda was born in Damascus, Syria, in 1924, where his father was also in the diplomatic corps, \"because,\" as he was later to advise his son, \"it is a profession that allows a great deal of spare time and the opportunity to travel.\" Father Was a Linguist\n\"My father knew many languages,\" Feradoun said, \"and translated a lot of books from French into Persian, from Arabic into Persian, and my mother took care of the house, cooked for us. For us, in our Eastern way of living, she was what they would call here a Jewish mother.\"\nWhen the child was a year old the family moved to Lebanon, where Feradoun, very much a city child, would spend his growing years. As one who was to try over and over again to record the experience of being torn between two cultures, Feradoun would tell me that \"childhood itself was another culture,\" as he reached out of adulthood to touch it again in his third novel, \"Dans une Terre Etrange,\" published in France in 1968. He was interested, from the beginning, in the visceral and in the cinematic, and started writing because he was dissatisfied with the way the image was translated into thought or reflection in so many of the books that he read. But his earliest exposure to culture was really through film.\nWe were going in so many directions at once as we came to know each other. First there was the phenomenon of multiculturalism which he feels, for all its flaws works better in the United States than in Europe, the way he grew up in a city \"with three or four cultures at once,\" for \"at home there was Persian, in the streets Arabic, and in school French.\"\n\"There were all sorts of Christians,\" he said. \"We had Jews, Bahais, Druse, Zoroastrians. So that you didn't feel like a foreigner. Multiculturalism was lived, it was not just an institution, and this made me a strong opponent of fanaticism. Everybody had a home in his own culture and in the social scene we would mix together.\"\n\"A nation cannot be multicultural if it has to have its values shared by everyone,\" he adds, as he speaks of the danger both of nationalism and of \"culture imposed with a sword.\"\n\"The moment I began to think about the world at large coincided with the Roosevelt era. When I was 8 years old there wasn't television yet, and I wasn't yet reading the newspapers. Beirut was a small city where nothing on the artistic level was important. People were living a traditional life, and the only thing was the cinema. By the time I was 5 years old in 1929 and the talkies were introduced, I had already seen many silent films, so that I had images before sound.\n\"At first when I began to think about thinking and I discovered thinking with images, I was very upset with literature for betraying this. I preferred adventure books that would follow the action in the way that a camera will follow it.\"\nAnd he spoke of the fact that even now he is more attracted to Dickens than to Proust, \"because Dickens can be so much more easily translated into film.\" He spoke of the importance of comic books in his early development.\nOn long afternoons, in between the \"bad movies like the Andrew Hardy series, which showed American middle-class families and kids who should be happy, having none of our restraints,\" he was introduced to the \"characters from the outside world who would remain with me permanently -- Roosevelt, and Mayor La Guardia, which gave me my first interest in discovering America, and Gandhi coming all the way to London to get milk for his goat. It was in the newsreels as well that I caught my first glimpses of Chaplin and Einstein.\"\nTaking with him his emerging interests in cinema and politics, Feradoun went to study at the Sorbonne, receiving his doctorate in Paris in 1948. It was during a time of war, and also of intellectual turmoil in Paris. Upon graduation he was, for a short time, press attache for the Iranian foreign service. In his spare time he would take off his formal clothing and go to the Museum of Cinema, where he began to know Truffaut, whose picture he would later show me, along with pictures of himself with Presidents Carter and Ford, and Henry Kissinger, intermingled with the photographs of Nureyev, Robert De Niro, Sadat, Arafat and Jerzy Kosinski.\nThe psychoanalysts during that period, he said, were mainly people who were in art, who were involved in applying psychoanalytic theory to the world of imagery.\nLater on when he came to this country to work for the United Nations, he would become friendly with Robert Wilson and Richard Schechner, those of the theatrical avant garde. \"I inspired Robert Wilson's \"Einstein on the Beach,\" he says to me, \"when I told him, you have used Freud in some of your plays. The other part of the 20th century is Einstein.\" He and Rossellini were good friends in Paris, and when Feradoun came here, they spent a whole week of evenings \"taking off shirt and tie and exploring the East Village.\"\nYears passed. In 1980, he published a book on the Shah's fall. In 1990, he was chairman of a conference on the \"Repercussions of the Disintegration of the Soviet Empire.\" In 1992 he was a member of a fact-finding mission to South Africa. In 1993 he attended the Second World Conference on Human Rights. \"More and more I believe that reforms have to come from the people themselves,\" he tells me.\nI ask him about Taslima Nasrin, the 31-year-old Bangladeshi poet, deprived of her passport, who carries a threat on her life and a head price of $1,250 set by the Council of Soldiers for Islam, for her book \"Lajja\" (\"The Shame\"), which sold 50,000 copies in the six months since its publication, which treated sympathetically the plight of a Hindu family suffering persecution following the 1992 destruction of the Babri mosque in India, her statement \"I tried to say, shame to all dark aspects of fundamentalism. I said, let's uphold humanism instead of using religion to kill each other.\"\nAnd he in turn shows me his contribution to a recent book of 100 Muslim and Arab intellectuals writing \"For Rushdie.\" His short entry is outspoken, both in his lack of admiration for Rushdie's writing and his cry ending with the lines: \"The last time that books were burned was in Berlin in 1933. The last time that writers were burned was in the Middle Ages.\"\nIt is his feeling that because Muslims living under fundamentalist regimes are so completely powerless to speak, those who are outside have a responsibility to create movements for tolerance in the countries they have left, working for equality between men and women, and fighting against \"backwardness\" in every way they can. This is very much the work that he wants to do.\n\"One should have the courage of the tomb,\" he says handing me a glass of wine, the formal part of our encounter being over, as suddenly, without warning he turns on his VCR.\n\"At age 70 one should not be afraid; life is behind, not ahead of you. You have dreams and dreams that never come completely true, but always half way.\" And upon the giant movie screen in the midst of the tapestries, echoing the grey greens and deep reddish crimsons of the rugs, we see the beginning of the day's news."}, {"text": "Crossroads for China; With Democratic Stirrings Among Chinese, U.S. Is Pressing Beijing on Crucial Choices\n1994-01-29T05:00:00.000Z\nUnder enormous pressure from the Clinton Administration, China faces a series of decisions that could result in greater freedom of expression and guarantees of basic human rights that Chinese leaders have long considered a potential threat to the survival of Communist Party rule.\nAlready there seems to be a new surge of democratic activity.\nLate Wednesday, 11 dissidents daringly signed a two-page statement calling for the release of Qin Yongmin, a young pampleteer dispatched by the Public Security Bureau last month for two years of hard labor. His crime was urging nonviolent political change in a \"peace charter\" written in November. Vowing to Speak Out\nHe joins thousands of others still imprisoned in China for the nonviolent expression of their political and religious beliefs. In his absence, his colleagues have vowed to continue speaking out.\nWei Jingsheng, China's most famous democracy campaigner, who emerged last fall from 14 years in prison, carried on a one-man free speech movement this week by giving interviews to foreign journalists on democracy issues despite threats by the secret police to muzzle him.\nThese stirrings can only be expected to grow.\nThe pressure to open the system up still further has come from President Clinton's threat to cancel China's low-tariff access to the American market unless Beijing makes \"overall significant progress\" in human rights, including freedom for significant numbers of political prisoners and Red Cross access to labor camps and detention centers.\nThe Administration also wants China to loosen its emigration restrictions and to stop jamming foreign news broadcasts into the country, and to come to terms with the long-simmering independence movement in Tibet.\nTop Communist Party officials, including President Jiang Zemin, have said China is \"going to make an effort\" this year to respond to Mr. Clinton's requirements. If carried through, these decisions will disprove the conventional wisdom that China's leaders are paralyzed with indecision as they await the death of the senior leader, Deng Xiaoping.\nIt is too early to say whether China will expand on the initial steps it has taken or promised in recent meetings with Secretary of State Warren Christopher and other American officials.\nBut if China complies with the American demands, the relaxation of repression could well reinvigorate the democracy movement that has been largely dormant in China since it last erupted in the spring of 1989, only to be crushed in Tiananmen Square. Next Few Months A Critical Period\nInterviews with China scholars, Western diplomats and economists suggest that the next few months are critical to determining the future course of Chinese politics.\nBy threatening to force open China's closed and intolerant political system, Mr. Clinton has confronted the country's leaders with a hateful dilemma.\nCancellation of China's favorable trade status could result in a catastrophic setback for its remarkable economic expansion, although such a move would also hurt American businesses that have been eager to invest in China.\nBut if China accepts the human rights challenge, its Communist leaders may set themselves on a path to extinction. The collapse of Communist rule, many Chinese leaders fear, could ignite social chaos, even civil war.\n\"The fear of social chaos is never far below the surface in their planning and thinking,\" a senior Western official, who works closely with top leaders on economic and development issues, said this week.\nBetween the extremes, a middle path for political reform in China seems possible, but it is seldom debated, since the Communist Party considers power sharing another form of suicide.\nMany economists say the key to China's uninterrupted expansion lies in the United States, where China sold as much as $40 billion in goods in 1993, a phenomenal leap from $2.5 billion in sales just 10 years earlier.\nThus, when the history of China at the end of the 20th century is written, it will have to be asked whether this group of colorless Communist cadres, the successors of Mao and Deng, nurtured or undermined the largest economic expansion in China's history. Is the Leadership Capable of Acting?\nTo protect this vast export market in America, China must change, President Clinton says, and there are several basic questions about that change. First among them is whether the Chinese leadership can make tough decisions, or whether it is too paralyzed by factional rivalries as it awaits the death of Mr. Deng, who is 89 and in declining health.\nThe conventional wisdom for some time has been that China's leaders are seized by an abundance of political caution. This analysis holds that no leader wants to appear as having made concessions to the United States, especially on human rights or democracy issues, for fear of losing out in any power struggle with hard-line factions after Mr. Deng's death.\nTwo previous Chinese leaders, Hu Yaobang in 1987 and Zhao Ziyang in 1989, lost their jobs by showing sympathy for democratic reform.\nBut over the last several months, Chinese leaders seem to be paving the way for some major new decisions on human rights.\nFor the first time in 45 years, they have entered detailed discussions with the International Committee of the Red Cross about opening Chinese prisons. Such a decision would allow Red Cross workers to visit any political prisoner and determine if he or she was being tortured or mistreated.\nLast week in Paris, the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, told Secretary Christopher that China would for the first time give detailed information on the list of 235 Chinese political prisoners compiled by Washington last fall. This information exchange is the prelude to what President Clinton hopes will be a large-scale release.\nA Hong Kong human rights campaigner, John T. Kamm, said this week that China might have already quietly released between 30 and 60 political prisoners whose names were among the 235.\nThere are also some signs, Mr. Kamm says, that China is putting greater numbers of political prisoners on \"medical parole.\"\nWhile considered promising, these developments merely lay the groundwork for the much tougher decisions ahead, principally the full release of the remaining prisoners and protections against future arrests.\nSome decisions have been made, but Clinton Administration officials say they are not enough.\nLast week, China agreed to tighten an agreement to prevent products made by prison labor from being exported to the United States. And China made major concessions to the United States this month to strike a new textile agreement, which for the first time permits United States customs inspections on Chinese soil.\nThese steps have done nothing to dismantle the security apparatus that suppresses free expression and keeps the Communist Party in power, but they show that China's leaders are capable of acting.\nEarlier this month, Qiao Shi, the head of China's Parliament and a former chief of the country's security services, toured several European capitals, where he said China needed to learn from Western countries how to establish a rule of law to protect its citizens.\nThe Justice Minister, Xiao Yang, has been talking about the need for China to train tens of thousands of lawyers in this decade to represent companies and citizens in court.\nThe sincerity of these statements will be tested in the months ahead. Will Rights Gains Be Reversed Later?\nBut another question is whether, even if Chinese leaders make major decisions to improve human rights conditions, they will they stick to them.\nA decision by the Politburo to respond fully to President Clinton's human rights challenge could open China's more than 1,200 prisons, labor camps and detention centers to international inspection and could lead to the eventual release of hundreds, if not thousands, of political and religious prisoners.\nHowever large the exodus, this tiny but potent population of free-thinking opponents of Communist rule, set loose in the sea of 1.2 billion Chinese, could well form the nucleus of a new democracy movement in China and Tibet.\nGiven China's past record for releasing handfuls of political dissidents while arresting dozens or even hundreds of others in a given year, many human rights officials say the Communist leadership cannot afford a wholesale release of political prisoners.\nChina's most famous dissident, Mr. Wei, said this week that because China did not yet follow the rule of law, it could easily roll back any concessions it made on human rights.\n\"The Clinton Administration has to be alert not to be cheated,\" Mr. Wei said. \"If you do not exert continuous pressures, the Chinese Government will very soon take back what it has said.\"\nBut as Mr. Wei's release has demonstrated, the Communist state has not collapsed under the force of his free speech.\nIt is also certain that if President Clinton rewards a bold step by China on human rights by lifting the conditions on trade relations, a sudden relapse by China would set off a storm of indignation in Congress. It would also be likely to lead to trade sanctions.\nThe United States Ambassador to China, J. Stapleton Roy, said in a recent interview, \"It is impossible for a country like the United States to have normal relations with a country that resorts to overt suppression of its own people.\" Would Democracy Lead to Civil War?\nIf China releases its political prisoners and tolerates a new era of democratic debate, will Mr. Deng's prophecy that democracy will only lead to chaos and civil war come true?\nIn the four and a half years since the Tiananmen massacre, and after a great deal of soul searching, student leaders and supporters of democratic change have asked whether a significant victory was frittered away because the students could not decide how and when to end their long siege of central Beijing. That siege lasted lasted almost continuously from mid-April to early June 1989.\nThe military assault on the night of June 3-4 and its bloody outcome followed many abortive attempts at compromise. The explosion of violence sent China into a spasm of withdrawal and repression that lasted for three years before it began to thaw.\nIt was clear in the aftermath that the student protesters in Beijing did not necessarily represent the vast majority of Chinese, especially the 800 million peasants of rural China. Most Chinese, while interested in democracy, crave stability and prosperity above all else, even under authoritarian rule.\nToday, it is unlikely that another mass democracy protest could occur. The Government can now deploy a rapid-reaction armed police force to stop any protest in its early stage.\nIt is widely believed among Western and Asian diplomats that if the death of Mr. Deng brings thousands of Chinese into the streets either to praise or to protest his rule, they will be greeted by a martial-law response, especially at the entrances to Tiananmen Square.\nBy all accounts, the Chinese people do not want another Tiananmen-style confrontation. But many Chinese believe that the country could tolerate a greater degree of political openness now. Perhaps because Mr. Deng remains opposed to it, the authorities seem unwilling to experiment with a more open political environment. National Priorities: Growth and Stability\nA final question surrounding the pressures confronting China is this: If China does make major decisions on human rights, what does it say about its national priorities?\nOver the last two years, China's leaders have established as their overarching national security goal the need to sustain rapid economic growth for the next two critical decades.\nDuring this period China faces a population surge to 1.5 billion or more before its population growth is expected to stabilize as a result of the one-child-per-family population control policy that has been in force since 1979.\nThe numbers are daunting. There are more mothers of childbearing age in China than there are people in the United States. Because its base is so large, China's population adds the population of Texas, about 17 million people, every year.\nChina's economy has to grow rapidly just to stay even with the demands for jobs, food and housing of this population, many economists point out. China's natural resources are under mounting pressure. Hundreds of cities are short of water, and arable land is shrinking under the encroachment of deserts and development. Per capita, China now has less arable land than Bangladesh.\nThese stark realities belie the image of China as an upstart Asian superpower, fattened by prosperity and harboring military or expansionist ambitions in the region.\nMany Chinese say that what their country desperately needs is internal stability, peace on its borders and peace in Asia so it can run the gantlet of its troubles in the years ahead.\nIf so, China needs foreign technology and foreign markets to fuel the engine of its growth.\nA new national strategy focused on growth and stability is one that may finally subordinate all of the ideological debates left over from the Maoist era. Such a strategy may also be able to accommodate a new commitment to human rights."}, {"text": "SHOWDOWN IN HAITI; In the Words of the President: The Reasons Why the U.S. May Invade Haiti\n1994-09-16T05:00:00.000Z\nFollowing is a transcript of President Clinton's address to the nation last night on Haiti, as recorded by The New York Times:\nMy fellow Americans:\nTonight I want to speak with you about why the United States is leading the international effort to restore democratic Government in Haiti.\nHaiti's dictators, led by Gen. Raoul Cedras, control the most violent regime in our hemisphere. For three years they have rejected every peaceful solution that the international community has proposed. They have broken an agreement that they made to give up power. They have brutalized their people and destroyed their economy. And for three years we and other nations have worked exhaustively to find a diplomatic solution, only to have the dictators reject each one.\nNow the United States must protect our interests, to stop the brutal atrocities that threaten tens of thousands of Haitians; to secure our borders and to preserve stability and promote democracy in our hemisphere, and to uphold the reliability of the commitments we make and the commitments others make to us.\nEarlier today I ordered Secretary of Defense Perry to call up the military reserve personnel necessary to support United States troops in any action we might undertake in Haiti. I have also ordered two aircraft carriers, the U.S.S. Eisenhower and the U.S.S. America, into the region. I issued these orders after giving full consideration to what is at stake.\nThe message of the United States to the Haitian dictators is clear: Your time is up. Leave now or we will force you from power.\nI want the American people to understand the background of the situation in Haiti -- how what has happened there affects our national security interests, and why I believe we must act now.\nNearly 200 years ago, the Haitian people rose up out of slavery and declared their independence. Unfortunately, the promise of liberty was quickly snuffed out.\nAnd ever since, Haiti has known more suffering and repression than freedom.\nIn our time, as democracy has spread throughout our hemisphere, Haiti has been left behind. 'Nightmare of Bloodshed'\nThen, just four years ago, the Haitian people held the first free and fair elections since their independence. They elected a Parliament and a new President -- Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a Catholic priest who received almost 70 percent of the vote.\nBut eight months later, Haitian dreams of democracy became a nightmare of bloodshed.\nGen. Raoul Cedras led a military coup that overthrew President Aristide, the man who had appointed Cedras to lead the army. Resisters were beaten and murdered. The dictators launched a horrible intimidation campaign of rape, torture and mutilation. People starved. Children died. Thousands of Haitians fled their country, heading to the United States across dangerous seas.\nAt that time, President Bush declared the situation posed, and I quote, \"an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States.\"\nCedras and his armed thugs have conducted a reign of terror, executing children, raping women, killing priests. As the dictators have grown more desperate, the atrocities have grown ever more brutal.\nRecent news reports have documented the slaying of Haitian orphans by the nation's deadly police thugs. The dictators are said to suspect the children of harboring sympathy toward President Aristide for no other reason than he ran an orphanage in his days as a parish priest. The children fled the orphanages for the streets. Now they can't even sleep there because they're so afraid.\nAs one young boy told a visitor, \"I do not care if the police kill me because it only brings and end to my suffering.\" 'A Terrifying Pattern'\nInternational observers uncovered a terrifying pattern of soldiers and policemen raping the wives and daughters of suspected political dissidents -- young girls, 13, 16 years old. People slain and mutilated, with body parts left as warnings to terrify others. Children forced to watch as their mothers' faces are slashed with machetes.\nA year ago the dictators assassinated the Minister of Justice. Just last month they gunned down Father Jean-Marie Vincent, a peasant leader and close friend of Father Aristide. Vincent was executed on the doorstep of his home, a monastery. He refused to give up his ministry and for that he was murdered.\nLet me be clear: General Cedras and his accomplices alone are responsible for this suffering and terrible human tragedy. It is their actions that have isolated Haiti.\nNeither the international community nor the United States has sought a confrontation. For nearly three years we've worked hard on diplomatic efforts. The United Nations, the Organization of American States, the Caribbean community, the six Central American presidents, all have sought a peaceful end to this crisis. We have tried everything -- persuasion and negotiation, mediation and condemnation. Emissaries were dispatched to Port-au-Prince and were turned away.\nThe United Nations labored for months to reach an agreement acceptable to all parties. Then last year, General Cedras himself came here to the United States and signed an agreement on Governors Island in New York in which he pledged to give up power along with the other dictators. But when the day came for the plan to take effect, the dictators refused to leave and instead increased the brutality they are using to cling to power.\nEven then, the nations of the world continued to seek a peaceful solution. While strengthening the embargo we had imposed, we sent massive amounts of humanitarian aid, food for a million Haitians and medicine to try to help the ordinary Haitian people as the dictators continued to loot the economy. Scorn for the U.N.\nAnd then this summer they threw out the international observers who had blown the whistle on the regime's human rights atrocities. In response to that action, in July the United Nations Security Council approved a resolution that authorizes the use of all necessary means, including force, to remove the Haitian dictators from power and restore democratic government.\nStill we continued to seek a peaceful solution. But the dictators would not even meet with the United Nations special envoy.\nIn the face of this continued defiance, and with atrocities rising, the United States has agreed to lead a multinational force to carry out the will of the United Nations. More than 20 countries from around the globe -- including almost all the Caribbean community and nations from as far away as Poland, which has so recently won its own freedom; Israel and Jordan, which have been struggling for decades to preserve their own security, and Bangladesh, a country working on its own economic problems -- have joined nations like Belgium and Great Britain.\nThey have all agreed to join us because they think this problem in our neighborhood is important to their future interest and their security.\nI know that the United States cannot, indeed we should not be the world's policeman. And I know that this is a time, with the cold war over, that so many Americans are reluctant to commit military resources and our personnel beyond our borders. But when brutality occurs close to your shores, it affects our national interests and we have a responsibility to act. Thousands of Haitians have already fled toward the United States, risking their lives to escape the reign of terror. The Costs to the U.S.\nAs long as Cedras rules, Haitians will continue to seek sanctuary in our nation. This year, in less than two months, more than 21,000 Haitians were rescued at sea by our Coast Guard and Navy. Today more than 14,000 refugees are living at our naval base in Guantanamo. The American people have already expended almost $200 million to support them, to maintain the economic embargo, and the prospect of millions and millions more being spent every month for an indefinite period of time loom ahead unless we act.\nThree hundred thousand more Haitians -- 5 percent of their entire population -- are in hiding in their own country. If we don't act, they could be the next wave of refugees at our door. We will continue to face the threat of a mass exodus of refugees and its constant threat to stability in our region and control of our borders.\"\nNo American should be surprised as the recent tide of migrants seeking refuge along our shores comes from Haiti and from Cuba. After all, they're the only nations left in the Western Hemisphere where democratic government is denied, the only countries where dictators have managed to hold back the wave of democracy and progress that has swept over our entire region and that our own Government has so actively promoted and supported for years.\nToday 33 of the 35 countries in the Americas have democratically elected leaders. And Haiti is the only nation in our hemisphere where the people actually elected their own Government and chose democracy, only to have tyrants steal it away.\nThere's no question that the Haitian people want to embrace democracy. We know it because they went to the ballot box and told the world.\nHistory has taught us that preserving democracy in our own hemisphere strengthens America's security and prosperity. Democracies here are more likely to keep the peace and to stabilize our region, and more likely to create free markets and economic opportunity and to become strong, reliable trading partners, and they're more likely to provide their own people with the opportunities that will encourage them to stay in their nations and to build their own futures.\nRestoring Haiti's democratic Government will help lead to more stability and prosperity in our region, just as our actions in Panama and Grenada did.\nBeyond the human rights violations, the immigration problems, the importance of democracy, the United States also has strong interests in not letting dictators, especially in our own region, break their word to the United States and the United Nations. 'The Right Is Clear'\nIn the post-cold-war world, we will assure the security and prosperity of the United States with our military strength, our economic power, our constant efforts to promote peace and growth. But when our national security interests are threatened, we will use diplomacy when possible and force when necessary.\nIn Haiti we have a case in which the right is clear, in which the country in question is nearby, in which our own interests are plain, in which the mission is achievable and limited and in which the nations of the world stand with us. We must act.\nOur mission in Haiti, as it was in Panama and Grenada, will be limited and specific.\nOur plan to remove the dictators will follow two phases. First, it will remove dictators from power and restore Haiti's legitimate democratically government. We will train a civilian control Haitian security force that will protect the people rather than repress them. During this period police monitors from all around the world will work with the authorities to maximize basic security and civil order and minimize retribution.\nThe Haitian people should know that we come in peace. And you, the American people, should know that our soldiers will not be involved in rebuilding Haiti or its economy. The international community working together must provide that economic, humanitarian and technical assistance necessary to help the Haitians rebuild.\nWhen this first phase is completed, the vast majority of our troops will come home in months, not years. I want our troops and their families to know that we'll bring them home just as soon as we possibly can.\nThen, in the second phase, a much smaller U.S. force will join forces from other members of the United Nations, and their mission will leave Haiti after elections are held next year and a new Haitian Government takes office in early 1996.\nTonight, I can announced that President Aristide has pledged to step down when his term ends, in accordance with the Constitution he has sworn to uphold. He has committed himself to promote reconciliation among all Haitians and to set an historic example by peacefully transferring power to a duly elected successor. He knows, as we know, that when you start a democracy, the most important election is the second election.\nPresident Aristide has told me that he will consider his mission fulfilled not when he regains office, but when he leaves office to the next democratically elected President of Haiti. He has pledged to honor the Haitian voters who put their faith in the ballot box. 'The Risks Are There'\nIn closing let me say that I know the American people are rightfully concerned whenever our soldiers are put at risk. Our volunteer military is the world's finest. And its leaders have worked hard to minimize risks to all our forces.\nBut the risks are there and we must be prepared for that. I assure you that no President makes decisions like this one without deep thought and prayer. But it's my job as President and Commander in Chief to take those actions that I believe will best protect our national security interests.\nLet me say again the nations of the world have tried every possible way to restore Haiti's democratic Government peacefully. The dictators have rejected every possible solution. The terror, the desperation and the instability will not end until they leave.\nOnce again I urge them to do so. They can still move now and reduce the chaos and disorder, increase the security, the stability and the safety in which this transfer back to democracy can occur. But if they do not leave now, the international community will act to honor our commitment, to give democracy a chance, not to guarantee it, to remove stubborn and cruel dictators, not to impose a future.\nI know many people believe that we shouldn't help the Haitian people recover their democracy and find their hard-won freedom, that the Haitians should accept the violence and repression as their fate.\nBut remember, the same was said of a people who more than 200 years ago took up arms against a tyrant whose forces occupied their land. But they were a stubborn bunch, a people who fought for their freedoms and appealed to all those who believed in democracy to help their cause. And their cries were answered. And a new nation was born, a nation that ever since has believed that the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness should be denied to none.\nMay God bless the people of the United States and the cause of freedom.\nGood night."}, {"text": "CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: THE POLICY Colliding Missions -- A special report.; U.S. and Bosnia: How a Policy Changed\n1994-12-04T05:00:00.000Z\nIt was the Sunday after Thanksgiving when Anthony Lake sat down in his Massachusetts farmhouse to work on a confidential memo to President Clinton, conceding reluctantly that American policy in Bosnia had run into a brick wall.\nFor months, Mr. Lake, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, had been talking about the need to combine the threat of force with the effort of diplomacy to protect towns designated by the United Nations as \"safe areas\" in Bosnia and quell the fighting. Now Bihac, a Muslim town in northwestern Bosnia that the United Nations had promised to protect, was on the verge of falling to the Serbs.\nIn his three-page note, drafted with the help of Alexander R. Vershbow, his top aide for European affairs, Mr. Lake said Washington had failed to persuade Britain and France to support NATO air strikes to try to save the town. Instead of pressing further for bombings, Mr. Lake recommended that the United States concentrate on trying to secure a cease-fire and on stepping up its diplomacy.\n\"Bihac's fall has exposed the inherent contradictions in trying to use NATO air power coercively against the Bosnian Serbs when our allies have troops on the ground attempting to maintain impartiality in performing a humanitarian mission,\" he wrote. \"The stick of military pressure seems no longer viable.\"\nFrom his house overlooking a pasture full of cattle, Mr. Lake faxed the memo to the White House, which in turn faxed it to Mr. Clinton, who approved it. Still smarting from his setback inmidterm elections, the President was at his Camp David retreat and had been involved only episodically in the Bosnian issue.\nThe next day Mr. Lake's conclusions were formally embraced at a meeting of the President's top advisers that neither Mr. Clinton nor Vice President Al Gore attended, and American policy on the 32-month-old war in Bosnia reached an important milestone.\nThe threat of bombing raids to pressure the Serbs to go along with a peace settlement would be put aside for now. Having failed to stop the assault on Bihac because it could not bend the wills of Britain and France, the United States concluded that it was more important to re-establish unity in NATO. But to do so, the leader of the alliance had to take a back seat to its junior partners, Britain and France.\nThe story of how and why the allies failed to act in Bihac, pieced together from interviews with American, British and French officials, goes well beyond the Balkans. It is a tale of the changing dynamics within the 45-year old NATO alliance, which is still searching for a role in a world with no clear adversary such as that embodied for decades by the Soviet Union.\nWith the common enemy gone, it has become increasingly hard for the United States, Britain and France to find the point where their national security interests converge. The United States, unwilling to send troops into Bosnia until the fighting stopped, was unable to impose its will on European allies that do have soldiers on the ground there. Washington managed to ease the worst NATO dispute since the 1956 Suez crisis not by leading the alliance to a consensus, but by acquiescing to the British and the French.\nLast February, in response to a mortar attack that killed 68 people in a Sarajevo marketplace, President Clinton successfully pushed the alliance to create a weapons-free zone around the Bosnian capital. This time, Mr. Clinton contacted only President Francois Mitterrand of France. But the French, the architects last year of the \"safe area\" policy, were now siding with the British, who had been forced to go along with the threat of air strikes last February, and the Europeans prevailed.\nNATO's unity was preserved. But a solution to the long war in Bosnia seemed more elusive than ever, and the United States is now looking for ways to keep the Serbs from feeling they have a completely free hand. The Rift Shift on Embargo Strains Allies\nThe low point in the dispute between the United States and Western Europe over Bosnia came three weeks ago. Frustrated by the Bosnian Serbs' refusal to accept an international peace proposal, and by the Western Europeans' unwillingness to use military pressure, Congress ordered a significant change: as of mid-November, the United States would no longer enforce the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government.\nThough the move had been telegraphed in the Congressional record since August, and its importance was more symbolic than substantive, it led to bitter recriminations within NATO. The leader of the alliance took the extraordinary step of saying it would no longer share intelligence with its closest allies or use its ships to monitor the weapons ban on the Bosnians.\nAs the Americans and Western Europeans were squabbling, the fighting in Bosnia was heating up.\nLong frustrated over being cut off from food and relief supplies, the mainly Muslim Bosnian Government troops in Bihac opened an offensive in early November to push out of the enclave. The Clinton Administration refused to condemn the attacks, reasoning that the Muslims were victims in the war and were trying to reclaim their own territory. But Foreign Minister Alain Juppe of France and Foreign SecretaryDouglas Hurd of Britain complained that the Muslims were now acting as aggressors.\nThe United States and Western Europe might simply have agreed to disagree on the wisdom and morality of the offensive, had the Muslims prevailed for more than a few weeks. But the Muslim breakout from Bihac was risky -- so much so that Croatian military leaders warned the Bosnian Government against launching the attack.\nBihac was near Krajina, the Serb-controlled area of Croatia, and the Croatian Serbs soon joined in the fighting. According to an American official, 2,000 to 4,000 Croatian Serbs joined some 10,000 Bosnian Serbs in the fray, using supplies from Serbia, despite an agreement by Serbia's President, Slobodan Milosevic, to cut off all aid to the Bosnian Serb combatants.\n\"We saw no shortage of ammunition, no shortage of supplies on the part of the Bosnian Serbs as they conducted the Bihac counteroffensive,\" a senior Administration official said.\nThe Bosnian Government apparently had not calculated that the United States and its Western European allies would allow the Krajina Serbs to cross an international border in support of their Serbian brethren. The Serbs were also supported by Muslims loyal to a secessionist Muslim leader, Fikret Abdic.\nThe Croatian Serbs' intervention was decisive, and the Muslims were beaten back.\nIn a move that would set off alarm bells in Washington, the Croatian Defense Minister, Gojko Susak, signaled to Peter W. Galbraith, the American Ambassador to Croatia, that his Government planned to respond to the Serbian assault by entering the war. A cross-border triumph by the Croatian Serbs and Bosnian Serbs threatened the Croatian Government's ability to reclaim the third of its territory that fell to the Serbs in fighting there in 1991. Mr. Galbraith sent an urgent message to Washington on Nov. 11, passing on the Croatian warning.\nThe Clinton Administration feared that a Croatian Government offensive would lead to a wider war in the Balkans that could even prompt Serbia to join in. The New Strategy Making One More Exclusion Zone\nOn Nov. 12, the day Washington stopped enforcing the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government, Defense Secretary William J. Perry and Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met in Mr. Perry's office at the Pentagon. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Mr. Lake, traveling with President Clinton in Asia, were represented by their senior aides.\nThroughout the consultations on Bihac, Mr. Clinton was distracted by Asian economic issues, the push to win Congressional support for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and forging a relationship with Republicans in Congress.\nThe goal at the meeting in Mr. Perry's office was to draft a plan to keep the Serbs from taking Bihac and keep the Croats from joining the fight.\n\"Our No. 1 objective was to prevent the war from widening,\" said a senior Administration official who attended the meeting. \"The only leverage we had was to apply an exclusion zone.\"\nThe plan seemed straightforward enough. Washington had won NATO approval for establishing zones free of heavy weapons around Sarajevo and Gorazde earlier this year. This would just be one more.\nTanks, artillery pieces and other heavy weapons would be forbidden within 12 miles of Bihac and would be subject to NATO air strikes if the Serbs violated the ban. Since the zone would include part of Croatia, new Security Council and NATO resolutions authorizing the move would be sought.\nThe next day, American ambassadors throughout Europe received an urgent message to begin emergency consultations with allies on the plan. Meanwhile, Washington sent a message to the President of Croatia, Franjo Tudjman, urging restraint.\nBut the plan proved to be a hard sell, and the Clinton Administration gradually shrunk the proposed exclusion area, trying to make it more acceptable to the allies.\nFinally, it proposed a six-mile zone that would not include Croatian territory. That way, the Administration figured, the zone would not need a Security Council vote, with the risk of a veto by Russia, France or Britain.\nBut even the shrunken zone was too much for the Western Europeans to swallow.\nFor his part, Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose, the British commander of United Nations peacekeeping troops in Bosnia, refused to acknowledge that Croatian Serbs had joinedthe fighting, even though the United States shared intelligence with London and the United Nations indicating that they had done so.\nClinton Administration officials say they believe that General Rose and his French colleague, Lieut. Gen. Bertrand de Lapresle, commander of United Nations peacekeeping troops in all of the former Yugoslavia, have been taking their cues from their own Governments rather than from the United Nations, a charge the generals deny.\nIn their deliberations with the Americans, the British and French argued that the Serbs would content themselves with the retaking of lost territory around Bihac and would not threaten the civilians in the town. London and Paris were also concerned that the establishment of a new zone could prompt the Serbs to retaliate against their peacekeeping troops in Bosnia.\nSome American officials argued that Britain and France wanted the Muslim army to suffer a resounding defeat at Bihac so that the Bosnian Government would give up its effort to reclaim land it has lost across Bosnia. Western European officials deny that that is their motivation, but suspicions of this sort contributed to a tone of sourness in the alliance touched off by the United States' decision not to enforce the arms embargo.\nIndeed, tensions between the Western European allies and Washington became so high at one point that Mr. Juppe, the French Foreign Minister, suggested that the United States might be covertly supplying the Bosnian Government with arms in violation of the weapons embargo against Bosnian combatants. Peter Tarnoff, the Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs, flew to Paris and told Mr. Juppe that the charges were false.\nThe French Foreign Minister did not back down. \"I take note of your position,\" he said coldly.\nA senior Clinton Administration official observed: \"This was a terrible time within the alliance to get a decision. It was directly tied to disenchantment within the alliance with the Americans. They saw us moving toward unilateral actions on the embargo. It greatly complicated our ability to get action.\"\nWith little support evident for the establishment of a weapons exclusion zone, the Administration prepared a fall-back plan. If the Western Europeans did not agree that the Serbs' advances to date warranted action, perhaps they could at least agree on what type of future Serbian attacks would justify NATO air strikes if the Serbs kept pressing toward Bihac.\nMr. Lake later outlined this plan in a classified memo to Mr. Clinton on Nov. 18.\nThe idea would be to get the Europeans to agree on measures that would be \"triggered\" if the Serbs moved beyond the reclamation of lost territory near Bihac, shelled Bihac with artillery or harmed United Nations peacekeepers, Mr. Lake wrote.\nThe possible response included the establishment of some sort of exclusion zone, air strikes on Serbian artillery positions in Croatia that were attacking Bihac, air attacks against Serbian surface-to-air radar missile systems in Croatia, hot pursuit of Serbian planes into Croatian air space and air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces attacking the town.\nBut this plan also had little appeal for the Western Europeans. The Mixed Signals As Allies Debate, Serbs Advance\nAs Thanksgiving approached, the Muslim-controlled territory was dwindling by the day.\nTo stop Serbian bombing attacks, NATO launched a bombing raid on Nov. 21 against the Udbina airfield in Serb-held Croatia. But General Lapresle of the United Nations instructed NATO forces to avoid hitting approximately 15 Serb planes kept there so as not to unduly aggravate the Serbs.\nWestern European officials said that the strikes showed the alliance's resolve, but the Bosnian and Croatian Serbs appeared to have concluded that the West was afraid to take tough action and continued their assault.\nIn New York, Madeleine K. Albright, the chief American delegate to the United Nations, helped assemble a last ditch \"stabilization plan.\"\nThe United Nations Secretariat had complained that the weapons exclusion zone would not work because the 1,200 poorly armed Bangladeshi peacekeepers in Bihac would not be able to monitor the area. So a tiny sliver of territory less than four miles across and six miles long would be declared an \"enforced safe area.\"\nUnder that plan, all the Bosnian Government troops in the area would leave or be disarmed. Only 500 Muslim policemen would remain to keep order in the town of 70,000. Nationalist Serb attacks would be deterred with wide-ranging air strikes at ammunition dumps and supply bases throughout Bosnia, not just the weapons directly threatening Bihac.\nFor two weeks, the Western Europeans argued that the Serbs would stop short of Bihac, but the Serbs were now on the town's doorstep. Pinprick air strikes, the Americans feared, would no longer keep them from overrunning the town.\nStill, the Europeans made it clear they did not like the idea of wide-ranging air strikes. Soon after Ms. Albright outlined the plan in New York, Robert E. Hunter, the American Ambassador to NATO, presented it in Brussels, making it clear that the United States would not insist on the \"strategic strikes.\"\nOn the day before Thanksgiving, to back up his ambassadors, President Clinton called Mr. Mitterrand, who the Americans calculated could play a pivotal role in persuading other Western European nations to go along with the plan. He asked for French support, telling Mr. Mitterrand that Bihac could fall in two days and that a Serbian takeover might prompt the Croats to enter the war. There could be thousands more refugees, more killing and an escalation of the war, he said.\nPresident Mitterrand said he thought Bihac might not even last that long and that he needed to consult with his Foreign Minister and Prime Minister, who were traveling abroad.\nOn Thanksgiving Day, President Mitterand called back to offer only qualified support.\nThe French President said that Serbian artillery and troops were near Bihac and that they were not afraid of NATO planes. Mr. Mitterrand said that he was skeptical about the idea of some sort of exclusion zone but believed that some \"limited measures\" were needed, according to American officials.\n\"I appreciate that,\" officials quote Mr. Clinton as saying. He added that it was important to persuade Britain and other members of the alliance to go along.\nMr. Mitterrand reportedly said: \"We must do what we can without waiting. Do you want a NATO decision?\"\nMr. Clinton replied that it was important to move as quickly as possible, American officials said.\nThe stage for a NATO decision was finally set, but the alliance did not act.\nIn fact, although Mr. Mitterrand had voiced support for limited measures in the conversation with Mr. Clinton, the French Ambassador at NATO, Jacques Blot, argued that the new American plan would require more peacekeeping troops and hinted that Washington should supply them.\nThe Americans were angry that the French had not followed through, and French officials at NATO continued to complain that the Americans were demanding action but reluctant to expose their troops to the risk of Serb retaliation. The Second Thoughts Alienating Allies With No Gains\nOn the day after Thanksgiving, Mr. Perry and Mr. Christopher reviewed the maneuvering at a one-on-one lunch and concluded that the American demand for action was hurting the NATO alliance without tangible gains.\nMr. Christopher was scheduled to go to Brussels the following week to outline American thinking on how to expand the NATO alliance, and State Department officials did not want the trip to be overshadowed by reports of infighting over Bosnia.\nMr. Lake reached a similar conclusion. Two days later, Mr. Lake and Mr. Vershbow, his aide, drafted their memo for Mr. Clinton, noting that the American effort \"to use NATO air strikes to prevent the fall of Bihac has only intensified trans-Atlantic frictions.\"\nMr. Lake recommended that the Administration put aside for now its push to win support for NATO air strikes to protect Bihac and focus instead on trying to arrange a cease-fire in Bihac and on diplomacy.\nMr. Perry was the first to articulate the new policy, appearing on the NBC News program \"Meet the Press\" two days later and proclaiming the Serbs' gains to be irreversible. Now that the Administration had given up on persuading the allies to use air strikes to save Bihac, Mr. Perry sought to justify the change in policy by arguing that air strikes were not that useful anyway.\nThe next day, a \"principals meeting\" of Cabinet-level officials was held. By and large, the officials accepted the conclusions in Mr. Lake's memo. But Ms. Albright, who took part in the meeting from New York via video monitor, was troubled. If the allies signaled that there would be no air strikes, would they not forfeit whatever leverage they had over the Serbs, she asked?\nMr. Lake said NATO warplanes would still be available for close air support, meaning they could protect United Nations peacekeeping troops and Sarajevo and Gorazde if the United Nations asked for such action.\nMr. Christopher said it was not realistic to assume that \"strategic\" air strikes were possible, meaning wide-ranging strikes through Bosnia. While such attacks should not be ruled out, he said, emphasizing that possibility would raise false expectations. The New Policy Going Back To the Future\nMr. Perry's disclosure of the new Administration approach came before the White House had time to devise a plan to pitch the new policy publicly. Critics said the United States was merely inviting further attacks by the Serbs and had abandoned its leadership role in the Western alliance.\nEven some Administration officials wondered if Washington might have prevailed if it had made it clear earlier this year that its support for international peace efforts depended on the allies' support for air strikes to punish the Serbs if they spurned an accord.\nStung by the criticism, the White House insisted that Washington was simply beating a tactical retreat in the face of Western European objections. Mr. Perry, officials said, would explore the idea of establishing new weapons exclusion zones around other Muslim safe areas to deter Serb attacks when he met with Western defense ministers later this month.\nBut the larger issue was how the West would gain leverage over the Serbs without a credible threat of force.\nEven advocates of the policy shift seem daunted by the task ahead. \"The road will be very difficult,\" Mr. Christopher acknowledged on Friday."}, {"text": "Blowback From the Afghan Battlefield\n1994-03-13T05:00:00.000Z\nUnder a relentless sun, Noor Amin traverses the lunar terrain of Afghanistan. A commander of the Islamic Party, Afghanistan's best-armed and most radical political faction, he has just finished a two-month stint running a military training camp outside the ruined village of Jaji.\nBattling the wheel of his four-wheel-drive truck, he drives past miles of poppy fields where boys scrape brown opium into burlap sacks. To the east, inside mud forts in the mountains, laboratories turn the opium into heroin. He crosses the rutted highway running from the Khyber Pass to Kabul, the capital, past checkpoints manned by soldiers of the Islamic Party, their posts adorned with the grim image of their leader, Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.\nHeading north, he enters a ruined Eden, a natural paradise strewn with man-made disaster. Jade and silver rivers tumble through green valleys where every house, school and mosque is destroyed. Burned-out tanks litter the land like the carcasses of prehistoric beasts. The villages look like archeological sites. Hardly a stone stands upon a stone, save in the graveyards where thousands of slate shards are stabbed into the rocky earth. This is the last great battleground of the cold war, in which the Afghans, backed by the United States Central Intelligence Agency, fought off the Soviet Union in the 1980's.\nIn the five years since the Soviets withdrew, tens of thousands of Islamic radicals, outcasts, visionaries and gunmen from some 40 nations have come to Afghanistan to learn the lessons of the jihad, the holy war, to train for armed insurrection, to bring the struggle back home.\nFor nearly a generation, blood and bones were sown into the Afghan dust by the weapons of the superpowers, and now the land bears a harvest of holy war and heroin. The sole field of victory for C.I.A.-backed \"freedom fighters\" in the 1980's has become an international center for the training and indoctrination of terrorists. The veterans of the jihad have taken their war abroad to Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bosnia, Burma, China, Egypt, India, Morocco, Pakistan, Sudan, Tadzhikistan, Tunisia, Uzbekistan, Yemen -- and the United States.\n\"Yes, the whole country is a university for jihad, exactly as they say,\" Noor Amin declares proudly. He has come home to Asadabad, the ruined capital of Kunar Province, in northeastern Afghanistan. Inside a fortified warren of mud huts, he gently leans his automatic rifle against the wall of his one-room house.\n\"There are many formal training centers and the Islamic Party has many such schools,\" like the one near Jaji, he says. \"We have had Egyptians, Sudanese, Arabs and other foreigners trained here as assassins.\"\nAs in any outlaw culture, guns, drugs and money are interchangeable here. Nonetheless, the unfailing wellspring of cash is the cultivation, sale and processing of opium from fields and labs controlled by rebel commanders. Government estimates vary, but Afghanistan now produces roughly a third of the heroin reaching the United States. Hundreds of tons of opium base are refined into heroin and shipped via Pakistan, Turkey and, increasingly, busy new routes in the Central Asian republics and the Balkans.\nThe heroin boom is not only predictable but necessary, say Afghan leaders and American officials. It is Afghanistan's only real cash crop, and no outside authority has the influence or muscle to prevent trafficking in what is essentially a lawless country. There is no civil law, no government, no economy -- only guns and drugs and anger.\nAnd that rage is kindled every night in the campfires of the holy warriors. \"The jihad, in the opinion of the the United States, was finished when the Communists were defeated,\" says Noor Amin, draining his tea and dashing the dregs in the dust. \"But jihad has no end. It goes on forever.\"\nMOST AFGHANS WANT nothing more than to end the fighting and try to rebuild their prewar lives. But they know that's not going to happen. \"For us, Afghanistan is destroyed,\" says Abdul Haq, a politically moderate mujahedeen commander responsible for the Kabul region during the war. \"It is turning to poison, and not only for us but for all others in the world. If you are a terrorist, you can have shelter here, no matter who you are. Day by day, there is the increase of drugs. Maybe one day they will have to send hundreds of thousands of troops to deal with that. And if they step in, they will be stuck. We have a British grave in Afghanistan. We have a Soviet grave. And then we will have an American grave.\"\nIn a sense, there are already at least eight American graves.\nAfghanistan is where the man accused of assassinating two C.I.A. employees in the agency's driveway disappeared last year after fleeing the United States; where the men convicted of blowing up the World Trade Center, which killed six people, learned strategy and tactics; where the jihad called them and their spiritual leader, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind Egyptian cleric charged with conspiring to overthrow the United States. Several of those convicted, as well as defendants in another indictment charging a conspiracy to devastate New York with bombs and political assassinations, raised money for or studied jihad with Hekmatyar's forces.\nThe C.I.A. has a word for this: blowback, a poisonous fallout, borne by political winds, drifting back home from a faraway battlefield.\n\"It's quite a shock,\" says Charles G. Cogan, the C.I.A.'s operations chief for the Near East and South Asia from 1979 to 1984. \"The hypothesis that the mujahedeen would come to the United States and commit terrorist actions did not enter into our universe of thinking at the time. We were totally preoccupied with the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan. It is a significant unintended consequence.\"\nThe point isn't lost on Abdul Haq. \"After the collapse of the Soviets, the biggest enemy of the U.S., what they hate the most is drugs and terrorism, yes?\" he says. \"Afghanistan is now the leader of the world in drugs and terrorism.\"\nABDULLAH JAN, THE GOVERNOR OF LAGHMAN Province, knocks back his sixth cup of after-dinner tea, pops a Russian candy in his mouth and mulls over the recent history of Afghan-American relations.\n\"So the C.I.A. says we are the University of Jihad?\" He arches an eyebrow and smirks. \"Why is the United States afraid? After all, it supported the faculty of this university.\" So it did, and it did so in one of the least morally ambiguous battles of the cold war.\nThe villagers of Afghanistan first encountered the wonders of modern technology in the form of Soviet jets, tanks and helicopters. Moscow's military juggernaut killed or maimed perhaps three million Afghans and sent six million fleeing west into Iran or east into Pakistan.\nThe Afghans took on the infidels. They died in uncounted numbers. They lived on stale bread and tea. They slept on stones in the mountains. And they drove the Soviets out. They fought their holy war with roughly $6 billion in weapons and materiel from the C.I.A., Saudi Arabia and an odd alliance of Iranian weapons procurers, Arab princes, Egyptian politicians and Chinese generals. Together, the Afghans achieved a famous victory. Some say it was the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union.\n\"But the people of Afghanistan, we have gone from one jail into another jail,\" says Abdul Hakim Katawazi, commander of the state police under the last king of Afghanistan in the early 1970's.\nThe prison guards are a God-mad rabble, the foot soldiers of a new Islamic order who received their advanced training in jihad in the military camps that now dot the countryside. Roughly 20 such centers exist in eastern Afghanistan between Kabul and the Khyber Pass, mostly under the control of Hekmatyar and his commanders. The camps have grown up around abandoned villages and battered Soviet military garrisons. Sacks of flour, some purloined from donations by the United States Agency for International Development, are stacked like sandbags in simple huts. Weapons, a good many of them taken from C.I.A.-supplied caches hoarded during the jihad, are plentiful.\nIn these training centers, the foreigners learn about guerrilla warfare, antiaircraft weapons and rocket-propelled grenades. Much in demand, but too precious to fire in training, is the Stinger antiaircraft missile, supplied by the hundreds to the Afghans by the C.I.A. in the 1980's. An unknown number are missing and unaccounted for; the C.I.A. is spending $65 million trying to buy them back.\nThe men fly to the bustling frontier town of Peshawar, Pakistan, to the east, riding buses or trucks over the Khyber Pass to Jalalabad, in Afghanistan. The provincial capital serves as a way station for the new arrivals heading for the camps. Here are Palestinians exiled from their native land; cashiered Egyptian army officers; Moroccans, Algerians and Sudanese intent on bringing down their Governments, and from time to time, Americans from New York, Detroit, Chicago and other cities.\nThe Afghans who lead the training, like Noor Amin, are in high demand wherever radical Islam is at war, for their victory was the first triumph of Islamic warriors over an infidel army since the 16th century. \"Their jihad credentials, religious and political, are impeccable,\" says an American intelligence official. \"They beat one of the world's two superpowers and now they're working on the second.\"\nTHE DEAN OF THE UNIVERSITY OF JIHAD, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, represents almost everything Americans hate, fear and misapprehend about radical Islam. The feeling appears to be mutual.\nTalking with Hekmatyar is like listening to wind chimes tinkling on the porch of a burning building. A disarmingly feline man, he purses his lips and talks dispassionately of the death of millions. His aim is to build \"a true Islamic republic,\" under his dominion, and he has the will and the weapons to fulfill that dream. If it takes another generation of war, so be it.\n\"We have already had one and a half million martyrs,\" Hekmatyar said in a 1992 interview. \"We are ready to offer as many to establish a true Islamic republic. We are ready to remain in the mountains for another 14 years.\"\nUnique among the world's Prime Ministers, Hekmatyar has spent the past 22 months firing artillery shells and rockets into the capital of his own country. This act of political sadomasochism began the week the rebels took Kabul from the Soviet-backed regime. The barrage is aimed at the citizens of Kabul, whom Hekmatyar considers to have collaborated with the Soviet occupation, and at the armed forces loyal to Afghanistan's President, Burhanuddin Rabbani. It has killed more than 10,000 Afghans, driven hundreds of thousands into squalid refugee camps, created political chaos and blocked millions of exiles from returning.\nAmong the refugees is Mohin Ajan, a carpenter by trade, sent fleeing with his wife and seven children by Hekmatyar's missiles. \"He rules us by the power of weapons,\" says Ajan, who lives in a tent amid several thousand other internal exiles on a dusty promontory outside Jalalabad. \"He is the king of weapons, not the king of Afghanistan.\"\nHekmatyar's weapons, the source of his ministry, come mainly from the enormous arsenal sent by the C.I.A.. The United States and its allies gave him more than $1 billion in armaments: tens of thousands of assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades, millions of rounds of ammunition, hundreds of the deadly accurate Stinger missiles. Hekmatyar put away enough weapons to make war for four more years.\nNo one doubts he will. Hekmatyar's jihad never ended. When he speaks of a true Islamic republic, he means a land without borders.\nBY THE TIME THE SOVIETS LEFT AFGHANISTAN in February 1989, thousands of Afghan-trained volunteers were ready to carry on the war abroad. Thousands more took their place in the camps.\nThe militants took the torch of the Afghan rebels' holy rage and turned their energies to a greater battle. They saw the 1991 Persian Gulf war as a modern manifestation of the medieval Crusades, the Arab nations supporting the war as corrupt collaborators with Christendom and the United States and the United Nations as imperial knights with smart bombs. Their anger was focused on Arab leaders they saw as American agents, and on America itself.\nBy 1992, as Kabul fell into chaos at the hands of the holy warriors, posters of Saddam adorned Afghanistan's shops and bazaars, mounted next to heroic pictures of Hekmatyar. As freedom fighter fought freedom fighter over the nation's broken remains, the fire that fueled the jihad began to spread beyond the borders drawn by the 19th-century imperial powers, Russia and the British Raj.\nTo the north lay Tadzhikistan and Uzbekistan. Tadzhiks and Uzbeks by the millions live in Afghanistan; tens of millions of their Muslim brothers live in the former Soviet republics. Some 20,000 people have died and a half-million have been forced from their homes as Islamic rebels battle the pro-Communist regime still in control of Tadzhikistan. Russia still has thousands of soldiers stationed there, fighting guerrillas on both sides of the Afghan border. The President of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, says he expects the rebels to attack his country and Tadzhikistan this spring.\nTo the east, hundreds of Afghans allied with Hekmatyar have fought in the embattled state of Jammu and Kashmir, a territory disputed since the 1947 partition of India and Pakistan. Thousands have died in the struggle. In China, where Islam has been periodically suppressed, Afghan veterans have fought in two western provinces, Uighur and Xinjiang, where they have armed and trained Chinese Muslim rebels.\nTo the west, Hekmatyar has sent 500 mujahedeen to fight in Azerbaijan with Iranian forces, according to Haji Abdul Qadr, the Governor of Afghanistan's Nangahar Province. Hundreds of Afghans have fought against Serbs and Croats in Bosnia.\nNowhere have veterans of the Afghan war made a greater impact on society than in Egypt and Algeria. Since 1992, when a junta nullified elections that would have brought Islamic leaders to power in Algeria, more than 2,000 people have died in a continuing campaign of terror and reprisal. The Islamic rebels in Algeria have led a two-year struggle spearheaded by guerrillas who are known collectively as Afghans, regardless of their nationality.\nIn Egypt, an unending series of assassinations, attacks on Government officials and local insurrections can be traced to the work of al-Gamaa al-Islamia, the Islamic Group. This organization, blamed for the 1981 assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat, established headquarters in exile in Jalalabad and in Peshawar in the mid-1980's. One of the most prominent figures at those new bases was Mohammed Shawki Islambouli, the brother of one of Sadat's assassins. In 1988 and 1990, he played host to Sheik Abdel Rahman, a spiritual leader of the Islamic Group, who struck up a personal and ideological friendship with Hekmatyar.\nThe Prime Minister reaffirmed his relationship with the sheik in July. As one set of United States authorities weighed deporting the sheik and another prepared an indictment against him, Hekmatyar offered him political asylum in Afghanistan, calling the cleric \"a leader of the Islamic nation.\"\nAmong the sheik's followers is Mohammed Salameh, a Palestinian who in addition to being convicted in the World Trade Center case, raised money for the mujahedeen in Brooklyn. His roommate in a Jersey City apartment was Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, an Iraqi who fought in Afghanistan and arrived at Kennedy International Airport on a flight from Pakistan in September 1992. On that flight was Ahmad Ajaj, a Palestinian fresh from Afghanistan, whose suitcase bore bomb-making manuals. Ajaj was convicted in the trade center bombing, as was Mahmud Abouhalima, who also raised money for the rebels; friends say he went to Afghanistan to fight. Arrested in Egypt, he allegedly told Egyptian officials -- who may have tortured him -- that the World Trade Center bombing was planned in Afghanistan by veterans of the jihad, with the approval of Iranian intelligence officers and Rahman.\nTHE FURY OF HEKMATYAR AND HIS DISCIPLES may yet accomplish what Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, the armies of the Raj and the tanks and helicopter gunships of the Soviet Union could not. It may destroy Afghanistan.\nAfter 60 centuries, the villages persist amid a lacework of rivers in a wilderness of stones, terraced fields of grain, orchards of apricots and oranges and mulberries. The people there are as strong and as beautiful as any on earth. A great many of those who have survived the war -- commanders, elders, headmen -- are trying, against great odds, to save the surviving villages. They are not terrorists or drug kingpins. They despise Hekmatyar and his eternal jihad.\nIn the shade of an arbor by the banks of the roaring Kunar River, Haji Rahmat Khan holds court. An ancient man with a long gray beard and glittering eyes, he tells a sad story often told in his province.\n\"It's a Kunar story, but it's the story of Afghanistan,\" he says, his hands plucking at his bandolier.\nIt is the story of Jamillur Rehman, once Hekmatyar's commander in Kunar Province and the most famous of the mujahedeen in these parts. In 1984, he was enticed to leave his command and join forces with well-financed fundamentalists called the Salafis, bankrolled by ultrareligious Saudis.\n\"He became a rich man,\" Haji Rahmat Khan says. \"He took money from Saudi Arabia. All the Arabians gave him cars, money, everything.\" The money drew thousands of Arabs to the jihad, and today those men are fighting in Cairo and Khartoum and Algiers. After the Soviet withdrawal, the Salafis battled Hekmatyar's troops. The fighting destroyed most of what remained of Kunar Province. Jamillur Rehman was assassinated two years ago by Hekmatyar's forces.\n\"Those who killed him were not Russians or Americans,\" the old man says, his voice rising. \"Afghans killed him. Those who killed him wanted the country for themselves. Now Hekmatyar and the rest of our stupid leaders are killing all our brothers, making them die like donkeys, not like heroes. We can't get rid of them -- we'd be killed or jailed.\n\"We didn't choose these leaders. The United States made Hekmatyar by giving him his weapons. Now we want the United States to shake these leaders and make them stop the killing, to save us from them.\n\"There is a fire burning in Afghanistan. Now, if there is a fire in my house, and my neighbor won't help put it out, what kind of neighbor is he? Doesn't he understand that his own house may burn?\"\nnder a relentless sun, Noor Amin traverses the lunar terrain of Afghanistan. A commander of the Islamic Party, Afghanistan's best-armed and most radical political faction, he has just finished a two-month stint running a military training camp outside the ruined village of Jaji.\nBattling the wheel of his four-wheel-drive truck, he drives past miles of poppy fields where boys scrape brown opium into burlap sacks. To the east, inside mud forts in the mountains, laboratories turn the opium into heroin. He crosses the rutted highway running from the Khyber Pass to Kabul, the capital, past checkpoints manned by soldiers of the Islamic Party, their posts adorned with the grim image of their leader, Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.\nHeading north, he enters a ruined Eden, a natural paradise strewn with man-made disaster. Jade and silver rivers tumble through green valleys where every house, school and mosque is destroyed. Burned-out tanks litter the land like the carcasses of prehistoric beasts. The villages look like archeological sites. Hardly a stone stands upon a stone, save in the graveyards where thousands of slate shards are stabbed into the rocky earth. This is the last great battleground of the cold war, in which the Afghans, backed by the United States Central Intelligence Agency, fought off the Soviet Union in the 1980's.\nIn the five years since the Soviets withdrew, tens of thousands of Islamic radicals, outcasts, visionaries and gunmen from some 40 nations have come to Afghanistan to learn the lessons of the jihad, the holy war, to train for armed insurrection, to bring the struggle back home.\nFor nearly a generation, blood and bones were sown into the Afghan dust by the weapons of the superpowers, and now the land bears a harvest of holy war and heroin. The sole field of victory for C.I.A.-backed \"freedom fighters\" in the 1980's has become an international center for the training and indoctrination of terrorists. The veterans of the jihad have taken their war abroad to Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bosnia, Burma, China, Egypt, India, Morocco, Pakistan, Sudan, Tadzhikistan, Tunisia, Uzbekistan, Yemen -- and the United States.\n\"Yes, the whole country is a university for jihad, exactly as they say,\" Noor Amin declares proudly. He has come home to Asadabad, the ruined capital of Kunar Province, in northeastern Afghanistan. Inside a fortified warren of mud huts, he gently leans his automatic rifle against the wall of his one-room house.\n\"There are many formal training centers and the Islamic Party has many such schools,\" like the one near Jaji, he says. \"We have had Egyptians, Sudanese, Arabs and other foreigners trained here as assassins.\"\nAs in any outlaw culture, guns, drugs and money are interchangeable here. Nonetheless, the unfailing wellspring of cash is the cultivation, sale and processing of opium from fields and labs controlled by rebel commanders. Government estimates vary, but Afghanistan now produces roughly a third of the heroin reaching the United States. Hundreds of tons of opium base are refined into heroin and shipped via Pakistan, Turkey and, increasingly, busy new routes in the Central Asian republics and the Balkans.\nThe heroin boom is not only predictable but necessary, say Afghan leaders and American officials. It is Afghanistan's only real cash crop, and no outside authority has the influence or muscle to prevent trafficking in what is essentially a lawless country. There is no civil law, no government, no economy -- only guns and drugs and anger.\nAnd that rage is kindled every night in the campfires of the holy warriors. \"The jihad, in the opinion of the the United States, was finished when the Communists were defeated,\" says Noor Amin, draining his tea and dashing the dregs in the dust. \"But jihad has no end. It goes on forever.\"\nMOST AFGHANS WANT nothing more than to end the fighting and try to rebuild their prewar lives. But they know that's not going to happen. \"For us, Afghanistan is destroyed,\" says Abdul Haq, a politically moderate mujahedeen commander responsible for the Kabul region during the war. \"It is turning to poison, and not only for us but for all others in the world. If you are a terrorist, you can have shelter here, no matter who you are. Day by day, there is the increase of drugs. Maybe one day they will have to send hundreds of thousands of troops to deal with that. And if they step in, they will be stuck. We have a British grave in Afghanistan. We have a Soviet grave. And then we will have an American grave.\"\nIn a sense, there are already at least eight American graves.\nAfghanistan is where the man accused of assassinating two C.I.A. employees in the agency's driveway disappeared last year after fleeing the United States; where the men convicted of blowing up the World Trade Center, which killed six people, learned strategy and tactics; where the jihad called them and their spiritual leader, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind Egyptian cleric charged with conspiring to overthrow the United States. Several of those convicted, as well as defendants in another indictment charging a conspiracy to devastate New York with bombs and political assassinations, raised money for or studied jihad with Hekmatyar's forces.\nThe C.I.A. has a word for this: blowback, a poisonous fallout, borne by political winds, drifting back home from a faraway battlefield.\n\"It's quite a shock,\" says Charles G. Cogan, the C.I.A.'s operations chief for the Near East and South Asia from 1979 to 1984. \"The hypothesis that the mujahedeen would come to the United States and commit terrorist actions did not enter into our universe of thinking at the time. We were totally preoccupied with the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan. It is a significant unintended consequence.\"\nThe point isn't lost on Abdul Haq. \"After the collapse of the Soviets, the biggest enemy of the U.S., what they hate the most is drugs and terrorism, yes?\" he says. \"Afghanistan is now the leader of the world in drugs and terrorism.\"\nABDULLAH JAN, THE GOVERNOR OF LAGHMAN Province, knocks back his sixth cup of after-dinner tea, pops a Russian candy in his mouth and mulls over the recent history of Afghan-American relations.\n\"So the C.I.A. says we are the University of Jihad?\" He arches an eyebrow and smirks. \"Why is the United States afraid? After all, it supported the faculty of this university.\" So it did, and it did so in one of the least morally ambiguous battles of the cold war.\nThe villagers of Afghanistan first encountered the wonders of modern technology in the form of Soviet jets, tanks and helicopters. Moscow's military juggernaut killed or maimed perhaps three million Afghans and sent six million fleeing west into Iran or east into Pakistan.\nThe Afghans took on the infidels. They died in uncounted numbers. They lived on stale bread and tea. They slept on stones in the mountains. And they drove the Soviets out. They fought their holy war with roughly $6 billion in weapons and materiel from the C.I.A., Saudi Arabia and an odd alliance of Iranian weapons procurers, Arab princes, Egyptian politicians and Chinese generals. Together, the Afghans achieved a famous victory. Some say it was the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union.\n\"But the people of Afghanistan, we have gone from one jail into another jail,\" says Abdul Hakim Katawazi, commander of the state police under the last king of Afghanistan in the early 1970's.\nThe prison guards are a God-mad rabble, the foot soldiers of a new Islamic order who received their advanced training in jihad in the military camps that now dot the countryside. Roughly 20 such centers exist in eastern Afghanistan between Kabul and the Khyber Pass, mostly under the control of Hekmatyar and his commanders. The camps have grown up around abandoned villages and battered Soviet military garrisons. Sacks of flour, some purloined from donations by the United States Agency for International Development, are stacked like sandbags in simple huts. Weapons, a good many of them taken from C.I.A.-supplied caches hoarded during the jihad, are plentiful.\nIn these training centers, the foreigners learn about guerrilla warfare, antiaircraft weapons and rocket-propelled grenades. Much in demand, but too precious to fire in training, is the Stinger antiaircraft missile, supplied by the hundreds to the Afghans by the C.I.A. in the 1980's. An unknown number are missing and unaccounted for; the C.I.A. is spending $65 million trying to buy them back.\nThe men fly to the bustling frontier town of Peshawar, Pakistan, to the east, riding buses or trucks over the Khyber Pass to Jalalabad, in Afghanistan. The provincial capital serves as a way station for the new arrivals heading for the camps. Here are Palestinians exiled from their native land; cashiered Egyptian army officers; Moroccans, Algerians and Sudanese intent on bringing down their Governments, and from time to time, Americans from New York, Detroit, Chicago and other cities.\nThe Afghans who lead the training, like Noor Amin, are in high demand wherever radical Islam is at war, for their victory was the first triumph of Islamic warriors over an infidel army since the 16th century. \"Their jihad credentials, religious and political, are impeccable,\" says an American intelligence official. \"They beat one of the world's two superpowers and now they're working on the second.\"\nTHE DEAN OF THE UNIVERSITY OF JIHAD, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, represents almost everything Americans hate, fear and misapprehend about radical Islam. The feeling appears to be mutual.\nTalking with Hekmatyar is like listening to wind chimes tinkling on the porch of a burning building. A disarmingly feline man, he purses his lips and talks dispassionately of the death of millions. His aim is to build \"a true Islamic republic,\" under his dominion, and he has the will and the weapons to fulfill that dream. If it takes another generation of war, so be it.\n\"We have already had one and a half million martyrs,\" Hekmatyar said in a 1992 interview. \"We are ready to offer as many to establish a true Islamic republic.

After all, it supported the faculty of this university.\" So it did, and it did so in one of the least morally ambiguous battles of the cold war.\nThe villagers of Afghanistan first encountered the wonders of modern technology in the form of Soviet jets, tanks and helicopters. Moscow's military juggernaut killed or maimed perhaps three million Afghans and sent six million fleeing west into Iran or east into Pakistan.\nThe Afghans took on the infidels. They died in uncounted numbers. They lived on stale bread and tea. They slept on stones in the mountains. And they drove the Soviets out. They fought their holy war with roughly $6 billion in weapons and materiel from the C.I.A., Saudi Arabia and an odd alliance of Iranian weapons procurers, Arab princes, Egyptian politicians and Chinese generals. Together, the Afghans achieved a famous victory. Some say it was the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union.\n\"But the people of Afghanistan, we have gone from one jail into another jail,\" says Abdul Hakim Katawazi, commander of the state police under the last king of Afghanistan in the early 1970's.\nThe prison guards are a God-mad rabble, the foot soldiers of a new Islamic order who received their advanced training in jihad in the military camps that now dot the countryside. Roughly 20 such centers exist in eastern Afghanistan between Kabul and the Khyber Pass, mostly under the control of Hekmatyar and his commanders. The camps have grown up around abandoned villages and battered Soviet military garrisons. Sacks of flour, some purloined from donations by the United States Agency for International Development, are stacked like sandbags in simple huts. Weapons, a good many of them taken from C.I.A.-supplied caches hoarded during the jihad, are plentiful.\nIn these training centers, the foreigners learn about guerrilla warfare, antiaircraft weapons and rocket-propelled grenades. Much in demand, but too precious to fire in training, is the Stinger antiaircraft missile, supplied by the hundreds to the Afghans by the C.I.A. in the 1980's. An unknown number are missing and unaccounted for; the C.I.A. is spending $65 million trying to buy them back.\nThe men fly to the bustling frontier town of Peshawar, Pakistan, to the east, riding buses or trucks over the Khyber Pass to Jalalabad, in Afghanistan. The provincial capital serves as a way station for the new arrivals heading for the camps. Here are Palestinians exiled from their native land; cashiered Egyptian army officers; Moroccans, Algerians and Sudanese intent on bringing down their Governments, and from time to time, Americans from New York, Detroit, Chicago and other cities.\nThe Afghans who lead the training, like Noor Amin, are in high demand wherever radical Islam is at war, for their victory was the first triumph of Islamic warriors over an infidel army since the 16th century. \"Their jihad credentials, religious and political, are impeccable,\" says an American intelligence official. \"They beat one of the world's two superpowers and now they're working on the second.\"\nTHE DEAN OF THE UNIVERSITY OF JIHAD, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, represents almost everything Americans hate, fear and misapprehend about radical Islam. The feeling appears to be mutual.\nTalking with Hekmatyar is like listening to wind chimes tinkling on the porch of a burning building. A disarmingly feline man, he purses his lips and talks dispassionately of the death of millions. His aim is to build \"a true Islamic republic,\" under his dominion, and he has the will and the weapons to fulfill that dream. If it takes another generation of war, so be it.\n\"We have already had one and a half million martyrs,\" Hekmatyar said in a 1992 interview. \"We are ready to offer as many to establish a true Islamic republic. We are ready to remain in the mountains for another 14 years.\"\nUnique among the world's Prime Ministers, Hekmatyar has spent the past 22 months firing artillery shells and rockets into the capital of his own country. This act of political sadomasochism began the week the rebels took Kabul from the Soviet-backed regime. The barrage is aimed at the citizens of Kabul, whom Hekmatyar considers to have collaborated with the Soviet occupation, and at the armed forces loyal to Afghanistan's President, Burhanuddin Rabbani. It has killed more than 10,000 Afghans, driven hundreds of thousands into squalid refugee camps, created political chaos and blocked millions of exiles from returning.\nAmong the refugees is Mohin Ajan, a carpenter by trade, sent fleeing with his wife and seven children by Hekmatyar's missiles. \"He rules us by the power of weapons,\" says Ajan, who lives in a tent amid several thousand other internal exiles on a dusty promontory outside Jalalabad. \"He is the king of weapons, not the king of Afghanistan.\"\nHekmatyar's weapons, the source of his ministry, come mainly from the enormous arsenal sent by the C.I.A.. The United States and its allies gave him more than $1 billion in armaments: tens of thousands of assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades, millions of rounds of ammunition, hundreds of the deadly accurate Stinger missiles. Hekmatyar put away enough weapons to make war for four more years.\nNo one doubts he will. Hekmatyar's jihad never ended. When he speaks of a true Islamic republic, he means a land without borders.\nBY THE TIME THE SOVIETS LEFT AFGHANISTAN in February 1989, thousands of Afghan-trained volunteers were ready to carry on the war abroad. Thousands more took their place in the camps.\nThe militants took the torch of the Afghan rebels' holy rage and turned their energies to a greater battle. They saw the 1991 Persian Gulf war as a modern manifestation of the medieval Crusades, the Arab nations supporting the war as corrupt collaborators with Christendom and the United States and the United Nations as imperial knights with smart bombs. Their anger was focused on Arab leaders they saw as American agents, and on America itself.\nBy 1992, as Kabul fell into chaos at the hands of the holy warriors, posters of Saddam adorned Afghanistan's shops and bazaars, mounted next to heroic pictures of Hekmatyar. As freedom fighter fought freedom fighter over the nation's broken remains, the fire that fueled the jihad began to spread beyond the borders drawn by the 19th-century imperial powers, Russia and the British Raj.\nTo the north lay Tadzhikistan and Uzbekistan. Tadzhiks and Uzbeks by the millions live in Afghanistan; tens of millions of their Muslim brothers live in the former Soviet republics. Some 20,000 people have died and a half-million have been forced from their homes as Islamic rebels battle the pro-Communist regime still in control of Tadzhikistan. Russia still has thousands of soldiers stationed there, fighting guerrillas on both sides of the Afghan border. The President of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, says he expects the rebels to attack his country and Tadzhikistan this spring.\nTo the east, hundreds of Afghans allied with Hekmatyar have fought in the embattled state of Jammu and Kashmir, a territory disputed since the 1947 partition of India and Pakistan. Thousands have died in the struggle. In China, where Islam has been periodically suppressed, Afghan veterans have fought in two western provinces, Uighur and Xinjiang, where they have armed and trained Chinese Muslim rebels.\nTo the west, Hekmatyar has sent 500 mujahedeen to fight in Azerbaijan with Iranian forces, according to Haji Abdul Qadr, the Governor of Afghanistan's Nangahar Province. Hundreds of Afghans have fought against Serbs and Croats in Bosnia.\nNowhere have veterans of the Afghan war made a greater impact on society than in Egypt and Algeria. Since 1992, when a junta nullified elections that would have brought Islamic leaders to power in Algeria, more than 2,000 people have died in a continuing campaign of terror and reprisal. The Islamic rebels in Algeria have led a two-year struggle spearheaded by guerrillas who are known collectively as Afghans, regardless of their nationality.\nIn Egypt, an unending series of assassinations, attacks on Government officials and local insurrections can be traced to the work of al-Gamaa al-Islamia, the Islamic Group. This organization, blamed for the 1981 assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat, established headquarters in exile in Jalalabad and in Peshawar in the mid-1980's. One of the most prominent figures at those new bases was Mohammed Shawki Islambouli, the brother of one of Sadat's assassins. In 1988 and 1990, he played host to Sheik Abdel Rahman, a spiritual leader of the Islamic Group, who struck up a personal and ideological friendship with Hekmatyar.\nThe Prime Minister reaffirmed his relationship with the sheik in July. As one set of United States authorities weighed deporting the sheik and another prepared an indictment against him, Hekmatyar offered him political asylum in Afghanistan, calling the cleric \"a leader of the Islamic nation.\"\nAmong the sheik's followers is Mohammed Salameh, a Palestinian who in addition to being convicted in the World Trade Center case, raised money for the mujahedeen in Brooklyn. His roommate in a Jersey City apartment was Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, an Iraqi who fought in Afghanistan and arrived at Kennedy International Airport on a flight from Pakistan in September 1992. On that flight was Ahmad Ajaj, a Palestinian fresh from Afghanistan, whose suitcase bore bomb-making manuals. Ajaj was convicted in the trade center bombing, as was Mahmud Abouhalima, who also raised money for the rebels; friends say he went to Afghanistan to fight. Arrested in Egypt, he allegedly told Egyptian officials -- who may have tortured him -- that the World Trade Center bombing was planned in Afghanistan by veterans of the jihad, with the approval of Iranian intelligence officers and Rahman.\nTHE FURY OF HEKMATYAR AND HIS DISCIPLES may yet accomplish what Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, the armies of the Raj and the tanks and helicopter gunships of the Soviet Union could not. It may destroy Afghanistan.\nAfter 60 centuries, the villages persist amid a lacework of rivers in a wilderness of stones, terraced fields of grain, orchards of apricots and oranges and mulberries. The people there are as strong and as beautiful as any on earth. A great many of those who have survived the war -- commanders, elders, headmen -- are trying, against great odds, to save the surviving villages. They are not terrorists or drug kingpins. They despise Hekmatyar and his eternal jihad.\nIn the shade of an arbor by the banks of the roaring Kunar River, Haji Rahmat Khan holds court. An ancient man with a long gray beard and glittering eyes, he tells a sad story often told in his province.\n\"It's a Kunar story, but it's the story of Afghanistan,\" he says, his hands plucking at his bandolier.\nIt is the story of Jamillur Rehman, once Hekmatyar's commander in Kunar Province and the most famous of the mujahedeen in these parts. In 1984, he was enticed to leave his command and join forces with well-financed fundamentalists called the Salafis, bankrolled by ultrareligious Saudis.\n\"He became a rich man,\" Haji Rahmat Khan says. \"He took money from Saudi Arabia. All the Arabians gave him cars, money, everything.\" The money drew thousands of Arabs to the jihad, and today those men are fighting in Cairo and Khartoum and Algiers. After the Soviet withdrawal, the Salafis battled Hekmatyar's troops. The fighting destroyed most of what remained of Kunar Province. Jamillur Rehman was assassinated two years ago by Hekmatyar's forces.\n\"Those who killed him were not Russians or Americans,\" the old man says, his voice rising. \"Afghans killed him. Those who killed him wanted the country for themselves. Now Hekmatyar and the rest of our stupid leaders are killing all our brothers, making them die like donkeys, not like heroes. We can't get rid of them -- we'd be killed or jailed.\n\"We didn't choose these leaders. The United States made Hekmatyar by giving him his weapons. Now we want the United States to shake these leaders and make them stop the killing, to save us from them.\n\"There is a fire burning in Afghanistan. Now, if there is a fire in my house, and my neighbor won't help put it out, what kind of neighbor is he? Doesn't he understand that his own house may burn?\""}, {"text": "One Leg, One Life At a Time\n1994-01-23T05:00:00.000Z\nSand and sky. That's all that's visible in the endless desert that surrounds Kuwait City. By 5:35 on a late-summer morning, the temperature has already climbed to 118 degrees -- and is rising as fast as the sun clears the treeless horizon. The Saudi Arabian border is 15 miles to the west; 40 miles to the east is the Persian Gulf. In between, in any direction, dead Iraqi soldiers still lie in the sand.\nPerhaps the most important feature of the landscape, however, is what is not visible -- which explains the cautious behavior of Floyd D. (Rocky) Rockwell, a mine field supervisor for a Tampa-based company called CMS, for Conventional Munitions Systems. A sturdy, suntanned man of 46, Rockwell walks slowly across the sand, swinging what looks like a green oversized metal detector ahead of him. Behind him, 22 men, dressed in tan fatigues and working in paired teams, proceed with equal care. They are, after all, in this together. Six days a week, for the past year and a half, Rockwell's squadron has awakened in darkness and driven 50 miles across the desert to this place: a purgatory 100 yards wide and 80 miles long in which, every six feet, deadly clusters of land mines lie hidden. Each morning, as the men arrive on the mine field's outer edge, they don helmets and Kevlar knickers and \"last chance\" vests, then step inside the looping barbed-wire cordon that defines the field's outer edges.\nA tiny speaker on Rockwell's mine detector screeches. He stops his slow progress, then eases the detector's oval-shaped head back and forth above the sand he has just covered. When the detector emits a sustained, steady yowl, indicating the exact location of his quarry, Rockwell twists and places the detector on the sand behind him. From a pocket on his safety vest he removes a large trowel and, crouching down, etches a line in the desert -- a reminder to himself of where he cannot step. Then, with long, gentle sweeps of the trowel, he begins lifting away the sand that has drifted over the mine. \"Because I'm working the outer ribbon of this mine field, I know I've got a Valmara 69 here,\" Rockwell says, taking a momentary break from his scraping. \"It's a bounding mine that, if I handle it wrong, will leave me blown up and bleeding, lying on my back and doing the funky chicken.\"\nSlowly, with a half-dozen more scrapes of the trowel, Rockwell exposes the mine: a dark metal cylinder the size of a thermos bottle. On its top is a spiky cone; each prong is a detonator. If touched off, the Valmara 69 -- known to the American troops as a \"Bouncing Betty\" -- will jump 4 feet into the air and explode, sending hot jagged shrapnel across a 60-foot circle referred to in mine sales literature as a \"guaranteed kill zone.\"\nRockwell rolls forward on his haunches. He pulls a sharpened nail from his vest, inserts the sharp end into the mine's firing mechanism and jiggles it, as though picking a lock, to disarm the mine. He unscrews the spiked top and gently lifts out the detonator, then pulls the rest of the Valmara 69 from the sand and turns it on its side. \"There,\" Rockwell says, without a hint of relief. \"That one's safe.\" \nTHREE YEARS AFTER COALITION forces rumbled across the sands of Kuwait, liberating the oil-rich nation from Saddam Hussein, the Persian Gulf war burns on. An estimated seven million land mines were sown, and subsequently abandoned, by Iraqi and coalition forces in the months leading up to the conflict. Since then, 4,000 munitions experts from six nations -- supported by nearly $1 billion in cleanup contracts offered by Kuwait -- have been moving slowly along, an inch at a time, unearthing and disarming them.\nThe mines are still explosive; most have been rendered even more volatile by a thousand days of constant exposure to blistering temperatures and sun. Some of them rest inside well-demarcated mine fields, hand-laid in sequence and roped in by dense concertina-wire fences. (In an attempt at fair gamesmanship, international protocol demands that even if individual mines are hidden, their general location must be discernible.) Hundreds of thousands more mines, however, have been sown across the desert indiscriminately, scattered randomly from aircraft or by artillery shells that open in midair like clams. Now the mines simply doze in the sand, awaiting any footfall that might strike them. In Kuwait alone, they have taken the lives of more than 1,700 Kuwaiti civilians since the end of the gulf war.\nThe cleanup is exacting work: hot, dangerous and grindingly monotonous. \"The boredom, nobody believes it,\" Rockwell says. \"You do the same thing, day after day, again and again. What keeps you honest is there's no second chance. You can't say, 'Hey, let's try that last one again.' \"\nThe mine field Rockwell works in was laid by Iraqis in a NATO-approved arrangement that Rockwell calls an \"A pattern\": one large antitank mine surrounded by three smaller (and nearly undetectable) antipersonnel mines. The latter are meant as deterrents, to dissuade tampering with the defensively valuable antitank unit. Yet there are more surprises in this field than the neat geometry of the A pattern would imply. Sometimes, in between the mines, the men stumble across unexploded submunitions: the lawn-dart sized \"bomblets\" that were slung, 247 to a brood, from exploding coalition cluster bombs. Unexploded artillery shells or aerial bombs occasionally stick up from the sand as well; each must be disarmed or blown up in place before the de-mining can continue. And each of these unexploded shells carries a secret: for any of a thousand reasons, it did not detonate -- and the slightest touch can easily jog its memory.\nNot surprisingly, the CMS employees are paid handsomely to do their jobs -- about $90,000 a year. Most of them, like Rockwell, are former military explosives experts, men who have left the scaled-down armed forces to join CMS's $100-million-a-year work force. In Kuwait, there is plenty for de-miners to do. More than 500 linear miles of mine fields stretch across the desert; they are being cleared by national teams from France, Britain, Turkey, Pakistan and Bangladesh. As the American team has learned, however, the mines in any sector are not limited to these mine field strips, or even to suspected battlefield zones in the desert. During their five-month occupation of Kuwait, Iraqi forces set mines everywhere -- in Kuwait City backyards, around Bedouin watering holes -- in an effort to terrorize Kuwaitis for decades to come.\n\"What the Iraqis accomplished is amazing,\" Rockwell says. \"They mined this whole country in less than half a year. They worked quickly and efficiently. They knew what they were doing.\"\nRockwell is a curious sight. Though evincing Gibraltar-like confidence, he is a veritable ant farm of nervous tics: jerks and jiggles left behind by 21 years of Army bomb-disposal work. \"The Iraqis set this field by the rules,\" he says, staring out across the desert from beneath the shatterproof face shield of his helmet. \"But they still toss surprises our way, to keep us on our toes.\" Although the Iraqis observed NATO and United Nations protocols, at odd intervals they've also buried antipersonnel mines two- and three-deep, hoping that whoever clears this field will, in a moment of slack concentration, step forward without rechecking where the last mine came from. \n\"That type of mining, it's an intimidation tactic completely,\" Rockwell says. \"Strictly mental warfare, to keep us thinking.\" He pauses and shakes his head. His helmet rocks back and forth. \"Unfortunately, once in a while, one of us gets blown up.\"\nRockwell speaks a grim truth. In the three years since Saddam Hussein signed a surrender accord with the United Nations, at least 83 mine experts from coalition nations have perished clearing the Kuwaiti desert of mines and bombs, almost as many as the number of Americans that died during the original conflict. In the first week of cleanup alone, all five Kuwaiti mine clearance specialists were killed, as were specialists from Pakistan and Afghanistan; last August, after a year and a half of working in the desert, several French and British mine clearers were injured in explosions.\nSo far only two CMS workers have been killed, which speaks well for the preparation (and luck) of Rockwell's personnel, many of whom were recruited from military bomb disposal units by Explosive Ordnance Disposal, the nation's largest bomb disposal talent scout. CMS workers have certainly handled their share of ordnance. In this field alone, they have detected, disarmed and destroyed 332,193 mines. That's 769 mines a day, 6 days a week, for the past 18 months. Yet even that's just a fraction of the whole.\nTHE AGE OF LAND MINE WARFARE HAS arrived. In Angola, two decades of no-holds-barred civil war may have left 20 million land mines in the earth: two for every person living there. They kill 120 Angolans each month, according to Human Rights Watch. In Cambodia, health workers calculate that, thanks to Khmer Rouge mine-laying teams, 300 people are killed or maimed each month and 1 mine remains in the ground for every 2 people in that country. In Afghanistan, 12 million mines were laid during the 1980's war with the former Soviet Union. Today, with fighting ended and the Afghan nation exhausted, the cleanup is slow and mines remain strewn across mountains and lowland pastures, on footpaths and roads, in irrigation canals and urban alleyways. In the former Yugoslavia, 60,000 mines are laid each week. And in northern Somalia and the Mozambique highlands, millions of mines ring native villages and water holes. The mines have replaced fallible human soldiers as sentries, stopping humanitarian aid from flowing in and keeping refugees from flowing out.\n\"Land mines are so plentiful and cheap -- as little as $3 a throw -- that their numbers have become staggering overnight,\" says Patrick Blagden, the de-mining expert for the United Nations. \"They're now so pervasive that -- and this is terrible to admit -- we can't even calculate how large the problem is.\"\nThat much about land mines everyone in the international community agrees on. Though estimates on the number of uncleared land mines vary, the figures tossed around are relentlessly impressive. The State Department, in its report \"Hidden Killers,\" estimates upward of 85 million mines are spread across 56 nations. Other computations run even higher. The United Nations, for example, estimates that 105 million mines or more may be deployed in 62 nations -- a figure, incidentally, that works out to 1 mine in the ground for every 50 people on earth. Cleaning them all up, Blagden estimates, will cost $200 billion to $300 billion. \"The mine clearance costs are the other dumbfounding aspect to this,\" he says. \"Over the next 25 years, we'll have to commit between $300 and $1,000 to clear every $3 mine currently in the ground. Obviously, the economics of this kind of warfare are devastating. Figuring out how we'll pay for the mine clearance is as difficult as the mine clearance itself.\"\nBlagden, a retired British Army brigadier, is seated in his office at the United Nations Building in New York. The walls of his office are decorated with banners that warn, in a host of international symbols and languages, of the dangers of mines. One of the larger banners, handed out in northern Somalia, shows a dead camel; above the camel is a message in Arabic and the silhouette of an exploding mine. Another banner, for Afghani refugees, has vertical columns, each displaying a different type of mine: a hand grenade on a stick; a large, steely cylinder; a green disk. \n\"We have no idea how long mines in the ground will stay operative,\" Blagden says. \"But we know they're waterproof and stable, so other than something coming along and setting them off, what's to stop them from lasting 50 years? A hundred years? Or longer still?\" \nBlagden walks from his desk to a tall gray cabinet against the far wall. Opening the cabinet doors, he extracts a green plastic disk the size of a hockey puck and places it on his desktop. \"There you are,\" he says. \"That's one of the most plentiful buggers out there. A Chinese-made Type 72 antipersonnel mine. It's all plastic, except for the slightest bit of metal in its firing mechanism. Virtually undetectable once in the ground.\" \nBlagden unscrews the top of the mine, then pulls the disk into two parts like halves of a yo-yo. \"There are millions of these mines, tens of millions of these, in the ground worldwide. And when as little as six pounds of pressure is placed on one, it is capable of blowing a foot and leg clean off, amputating right up to the knee. Nasty. Very nasty.\"\nIn the world today, some 340 types of mines are manufactured in 48 nations. Some of the makers, like those in China and Romania, are state-owned. Others, like the Italian maker Valsella or Thiokol in the United States, are private maufacturers who traffic specifically in government contracts -- agreements that, among other things, prohibit them from disclosing the numbers or varieties of mines they produce. All told, and not counting knockoffs fabricated in basements from El Salvador to southeast Asia, Blagden estimates that 10 to 30 million mines are produced each year. \nBlagden's gray cabinet contains several other mines, including a VS 2.2. It is made of molded plastic and is roughly the size and shape of a Frisbee. \"If I were to go to Valsella, the maker of this mine, and ask how many of these they made last year and whom they sold them to, they'd respond by sticking two fingers up my left nostril and escorting me to the door.\" \nAfter he retired from the British Army, Blagden spent five years working for a private, London-based company called Royal Ordnance, which was awarded the mine clearance contract for the British-assigned sector of Kuwait. During his year in the Kuwaiti oilfields, before the United Nations enlisted him (\"Under slight duress, I might add\"), Royal Ordnance workers pulled 524,000 mines from their sector of Kuwait, including numerous specimens of the VS 2.2. Valsella claims to work only for legitimate government contractors, but in 1991 several company directors were convicted of selling mines to Iraq through a Singapore intermediary in the 1980's. \"That Valsella,\" Blagden says. \"They can say they don't make these things, but I know differently. I've viewed their handiwork in the field.\"\nBACK IN KUWAIT, ROCKY ROCKWELL IS being careful not to cross the line he's etched in the sand. He stands up, then lifts his mine detector from the ground. The battery-powered detector, made by a Viennese company called Schiebel, is an amped-up version of the devices used by beach-going treasure hunters. Its batteries are checked twice daily, and CMS workers have found that the Schiebel detector functions best when the ground temperature is below 55 degrees Celsius (about 131 degrees Fahrenheit). Most days in the Kuwait desert, the ground temperature reaches 55 Celsius by 10:30 A.M., at which time mine sweepers mark the day's progress with staked flags and retreat to safety. \"The temperature restriction is why we start working before sunrise,\" Rockwell says. \"Otherwise we'd never get any work done.\"\nHe swings the detector over the hole left by the Valmara 69 to make sure it hides no extra mines; the speaker on the detector remains silent. \"That hole's clean,\" he says, moving slowly to his right, easing the detector's head half an inch above the ground. \"There should be an A-pattern arrangement of mines just over here,\" he continues. \"It'll be the first of six A-configured ribbons across this field.\" NATO has another approved configuration, what Rockwell calls a \"B pattern\": a trio of antipersonnel mines without a hefty antitank mine at its center. Rockwell is grateful for the order. In many zones around the world -- mostly third-world nations, where insurgencies, civil wars or genocide are prevalent -- mines have been sown randomly, without consideration for who will follow.\n\"You go to a place like Cambodia or Angola,\" Rockwell says, \"and your odds of finding mines are astronomically high. Like Mardi Gras beads on Fat Tuesday in New Orleans.\" Yet land mines are not spread solely by renegades, terrorists or minor despots. During the gulf war, for instance, coalition forces -- including the United States, France and Great Britain -- used artillery shells to scatter more than a million mines along the Kuwait border and around the Iraqi city of Basra.\nAfter another half-minute of slow searching, Rockwell's mine detector begins to growl; just beneath the flat, rounded head of the detector, a circle of greenish plastic is barely visible. \"There we are,\" Rockwell says, his voice muffled slightly by his face shield. \"A Chinese-made Type 72, an antipersonnel mine with real teeth.\"\nRockwell sets the mine detector down, kneels and trowels another line into the sand. He lifts the mine gently from its bed, then turns it over in his hands. It's the same mine as in Blagden's office, except three years of harsh desert conditions have pitted and faded its plastic top. \"See what the elements do to these things?\" Rockwell says. \"In some cases, sun and blowing sand will wear the plastic clean away, which can make a mine really squirrelly to work with.\" Slowly, Rockwell unscrews the disk. The Type 72, he says, is highly unpredictable. Its detonator, a sheer plastic diaphragm, is sensitive to downward pressure; once the diaphragm is depressed, the explosion cannot be stopped.\nRockwell removes the tiny metal \"booster cup\" from the mine, the primary charge that sets off the larger explosive. He screws the two halves together again and leaves the mine standing, sideways on edge, in the sand -- the signal to cleanup crews that this mine has been disarmed. \"All done,\" he says.\nRockwell stands and lifts the mine detector, swinging it first over the newly made hole. \"Nothing here.\" A foot to the right of the hole, the tan, rounded top of a Valsella antitank mine is flush with the surface of the desert; it's a Frisbee-sized VS 2.2. \"That's the antitank mine -- it's the centerpiece of this A-pattern group,\" Rockwell says above the prodigious squawk of his mine detector. \"There should be two more Type 72's here, too. We've already pulled the mine in the 9 o'clock position, but there should be one at 12 o'clock and one at 3 o'clock. It appears sand has covered them over; they're subsurface. Anyway, I'll bet they're here.\"\nRockwell eases the detector a foot further into the mine field, to where he believes the 12 o'clock position is. The detector begins to growl. \"There's the one,\" he says. He swings the detector a foot to the right of the antitank mine, to the 3 o'clock position. The detector makes a scratchy groan. \"There's the other one.\" Rockwell sets the detector down, removes his trowel and begins the same procedure he has followed precisely for the past 18 months. He etches his lines, then pulls the antitank mine from the sand, flips it over and deactivates it by tightening a single screw with the tip of his trowel. After turning the antitank mine on its side and double-checking the hole it has left, Rockwell kneels forward. With gentle scrapes of the trowel, he peels away sand in a slow search for the next small green disk.\nAS EXTREME AS THE WORKING CONDITIONS are in Kuwait, the CMS workers benefit from a number of luxuries. Their barracks are in fact air-conditioned twin towers in Fahaheel, a city 20 miles south of Kuwait City. Each night the mine sweepers can choose between staying home -- eating catered meals and watching CNN or Hollywood movies in their hotel-like suites -- or visiting the shops of Fahaheel, five minutes down the road by CMS four-wheel drive. There, one can find a half-dozen decent restaurants: Chinese, Middle Eastern, even pizza joints. The surprisingly lucid waters of the Persian Gulf lap just across the road from the barracks towers. Often in late afternoon, CMS employees can be seen spilling slowly back to the building after an hour or two of scuba diving. The beach, of course, is mined.\nMine workers elsewhere in the world are less fortunate. In Nicaragua, mines are cleared by hired soldiers in heavy lead-filled chest and leg protectors, often without the benefit of metal detectors. They move forward an inch at a time, pressing steel rods into the ground ahead of them at practiced, 30-degree angles, hoping their probes will hit the inert sides of mines rather than the explosive tops. When the day ends, they return to whatever home they came from, by whatever transportation is available, having earned $6.60 in wages. Conditions in Iraqi Kurdistan are tougher still. Unpaid volunteers must crawl along the edges of suspected mine fields, prodding the earth ahead of them with sticks or steel rods until a safe perimeter has been established and roped off. They do so without the security of protective clothing, and the venture comes with no salaries attached. As in poor countries worldwide, de-mining in Kurdistan is a task of survival -- and one that kills hundreds of workers each year.\nDespite the varying sophistication of mine clearance techniques, a mistake brings the same unhappy end. To minimize errors, CMS employees work in pairs; when on duty, a mine sweeper is either feeling his way across the ground with the Schiebel detector or he is acting as spotter for his partner (who's using the detector) by following roughly 10 feet behind and double-checking his movements. \"We switch positions every 30 minutes,\" says Bill Smith, a CMS mine specialist, \"so our concentration doesn't burn out.\"\nSmith, 38, is a retired explosive ordnance technician for the United States Army. Wearing dark sunglasses and dressed in a white CMS T-shirt, desert-colored fatigue pants and tan combat boots, he gulps bottled water during his 30-minute break, trying to combat the blistering 8 o'clock heat. \"Working in that Kevlar is hot, man,\" he says. \"You sweat yourself dry every hour. Between the dehydration and the unexpected stuff, after a few hours your concentration gets cooked out of you for the day.\"\nSmith has spent two and a half years in this desert, working first as an observer for the United Nations, then signing on with CMS. He has learned to take long days and unexpected events in stride. Often, while on his knees reaching for a mine, a kangaroo rat or dhubb -- a grayish eight-inch lizard -- will zip beneath his hand, exploding from the burrow it has carved below the mine. Other times, Iraqi sentries, posted along the nearby border, fire volleys above the workers' heads.\nBut his most unsettling experience as a mine clearer, Smith says, took place in March 1993. \"I'd just switched jobs with my partner, to be a spotter for him. We were walking back to work and we saw two antitank mines. My partner just reached down and pulled one up. It was a bad habit he had: pulling mines when I was too close. And I thought, 'Son of a gun, he's doing it again.' And I said, 'Hey, man, wait till I get into position before you start pulling mines.' \"\nUnfortunately, his partner, whom Smith says he trusted \"to the depths of my existence,\" had happened upon a mine with an anomaly called a floating pin, which renders it sensitive to jostling. \"Well,\" Smith continues, \"he had a second bad habit, which was to knock his trowel against a mine to get the caked sand off of it.\" According to Smith, whose back was turned at the time, he heard a tap, then a second tap. \"On the third tap, the mine detonated. And our mine detector -- which weighs 19 pounds and is 5 feet long -- shot past me at ballistic speed. This was a big mine, an antitank mine, not a little antipersonnel pop. And the blast wave hit me and something big caught my shoulder, which spun me around, and I felt something hit me, real hard, in the belt buckle.\"\nThe explosion pushed Smith from the already-cleared section of the mine field into the dirty, uncleared part. As Smith struggled to recover his balance, \"I looked back at my partner and there wasn't much left of him. His arms and legs were gone. Blown away to nothing. I looked down and I was bleeding pretty well from my left thigh. The rescue team came out, working their way across the clean part of the mine field toward my buddy and me, and my buddy was still talking out loud. Even with his limbs gone, he was coherent, making sense. The downed-man team had to hold his head down, so he couldn't look up and see what happened. They got us into a med-evac chopper, fast, and my buddy stayed alive for three more hours.\"\nThe next day, three employees quit the CMS force; the company bought their airline tickets home. \"Nobody gave them a hard time about it,\" Smith says. \"That's the thing. Everybody knows that you can't be worried or nervous in a mine field. If you are, you're no good to anybody.\"\nFor Smith, however, the way back led across the barbed wire. \"I knew I had to go back out there,\" he says. \"This is my job. And three weeks later, after the artery in my thigh had a chance to close up, I went back at work. I was still picking shrapnel out of my skin; it works its way to the surface over time. I've had to pick some of my buddy's bones out of me, too. I had a big piece of him lodged in my lip. It just came out recently. A long sliver of bone.\"\nDespite a constant ringing in his ears, which he characterizes as \"a thousand crickets in my head,\" and regular nightmares in which the concussion of the blast is replayed, jolting him awake, Smith continues to clear mines. \"It's what I do,\" he says. \"And when we get done here, I'll go and do this same kind of work somewhere else.\"\nTo maintain their confidence, most mine clearance specialists incorporate various talismans and rituals into their workday. One CMS employee has been eating the same food every day for months; another follows a strict dressing regimen each morning; another describes his meticulous shaving routine and the mantras he recites while traveling to and from the mine fields. (\"Some of them see themselves as artists with supernatural powers of survival,\" says Rockwell of the technicians.) Smith says a prayer on the way to work each morning and wears a hunk of luck around his waist. \"I don't kid myself,\" he says. \"A higher power has something to do with why I'm alive. You can be the most experienced guy in the field and if you get the wrong mine, your number is up. Like that blast? I should have died, but I was wearing my lucky belt buckle. A big rectangular brass thing from my Army days. That shrapnel hit the buckle just high of center -- or I'd be dead. The buckle has a dent a half-inch deep in it, and I'm alive because I wore that belt on that day. How's that for lucky?\"\nDESPITE THEIR HUNDREDS OF variations and dozens of manufacturers, land mines are easily divisible into two distinct groups. The larger antitank mines have been employed since their development in World War II; in testament to their longevity, each year on the Libyan coast units laid by Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps of the Third Reich are still unearthed and disarmed. But by and large, antitank mines are a small vexation to the world these days; they generally weigh 30 pounds or more and won't detonate unless hundreds of pounds of pressure are exerted directly on them. Also, because of their high metal content and overall heft, antitank mines are easily detected in the ground, allowing whole fields of them to be safely swept -- over time -- by small groups of men.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, however, are the antipersonnel mines. Inexpensive, readily available and nearly undectable once in place, they have quickly become the favored weapon in small-scale conflicts. Antipersonnel mines come in several different styles, from the basic foot-triggered models -- also called \"blast\" mines -- which shred lower limbs, to trip-wired hand grenades on stakes, to shrapnel-throwing beasts that resemble modernist sculptures and can be spread aerially. Their principle purpose is to maim rather than kill, since an injured infantryman is more burdensome to military support staff than a dead one. Considered together or individually, antipersonnel mines are widely considered the cruelest and least discriminating weapon of war, maiming and killing anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 people each year, 30 to 40 percent of whom are women and children. \n\"Who makes them?\" asks Gregory Fetter, an analyst with Forecast International, a company based in Newtown, Conn., that follows the aerospace and defense industries. \"I'll give you an international list as long as you want to hear. But no one will talk about it. You may get position papers out of some of the makers, but that's as far as it'll go. These makers want to protect themselves, their clients and their industry -- which is larger than you can imagine. Why should they disclose how many mines they make or who they sell to? Especially since, after they sell their mines, they're not even certain where the mines will end up. These things have an incredibly long shelf life; they can be stockpiled and resold, then restockpiled and resold again. They're literally impossible to track.\" \nIn recent months, for instance, Fetter has followed the sales from one Italian company to sources in Spain, Norway and Holland. \"But when those shipments get to their destinations, the paper trail ends,\" he says. \"It all turns into a shadow. Those mines I tracked, they could be anywhere in the world now. The arms traders run the show. It's all done under the table. But every nation is making them, and everybody is making a lot of them.\"\nThe United States alone, says Fetter, has made five million conventional land mines since 1970 and hundreds of millions of \"multiple-launch system submunitions,\" which are launched from artillery shells and effectively act as mines once in the ground. And the proliferation is accelerating. According to Fetter, there's no accurate or reliable way to follow the growing tide of emplanted mines. \"It's gotten to where the only way to estimate the number of mines out there is to monitor the profits of the mine manufacturers and to follow the rising number of casualties. It's grim business, sure, but it's the only halfway-reliable information we've got.\"\nIN A CONFERENCE ROOM OVERLOOKING the sidewalks of Washington, a prosthetic leg and its gray rubber foot sit atop a filing cabinet. The cabinet is in the offices of the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation and seated near it is Bobby Muller, the organization's executive director. Lean and energetic, the 48-year-old Muller, rendered paraplegic by a bullet in Vietnam, is intimately familiar with the deployment end of land mine warfare.\n\"My own ignorance about the human cost of land mines began when I was a Marine infantry officer in Vietnam,\" he says. \"Back then, I never considered mines to be a threat, or even a distinct category of weapon. Our forces just laid them down and forgot about them. No special thing. Everyone then was concerned with the nuclear threat. But after the Vietnam conflict ended, the mines were still out there, killing civilians indiscriminately.\" \nIn the early 1980's, Muller led the first group of Vietnam veterans back into Cambodia, where he was the first American to glimpse the destructive legacy of long-forgotten land mines. \"Because of all the amputees we saw, we had this anecdotal evidence that the mines we'd laid were still there and still operative. One of every 236 people living there was an amputee because of our mines. I couldn't get over it. In retrospect, the nukes threat, the one big boom, hasn't proved the mass killer. Instead it's land mines, the millions of little booms, that destroy whole populations. Land mines are the real weapons of mass destruction.\"\nMuller shifts his gaze to the prosthetic leg atop the filing cabinet. Called a Jaipur limb (after the city in India where it was invented), the leg is an aluminum shaft with a vulcanized rubber foot at one end; at the other end is a leather seat for an amputee's stump. Costing roughly $25 each, the Jaipur prosthesis is easy to manufacture, offers excellent traction and is water-resistant in sandy, rocky or damp terrain. Also, because of its adjustable shaft, the limb provides a custom fit for still-growing children. \"This foot was our initial reconciliatory gesture toward the people of Cambodia and Vietnam,\" Muller says. \"Beginning in 1989, we brought the technicians who make and fit these things in India to Cambodia, so they could train the local people how to do it.\"\nThe program was an instant success and thus far has fitted thousands of Cambodians with Jaipur prostheses, enabling them to return to relatively normal lives. It has also inspired other groups, in equally mine-studded venues around the world, to follow suit. Jaipur programs are now in place in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Mozambique and Afghanistan. Mortality rates have slowed, meanwhile, as surgeons grow accustomed to treating the amputations meted out by antipersonnel land mines. A land mine explosion is particularly violent, often driving dirt and contaminants deep into an amputee's wound, making infection as serious a threat to land mine victims as blood and tissue loss.\nNot satisfied with his after-the-fact role, however, Muller began to combat the very source of the problem. In 1991, while studying mine proliferation issues around the world, Muller and Jody Williams, the mines coordinator for the veterans' group, began sharing their findings with a German-based organization called Medico International, which was then working with mine amputees in El Salvador. The two groups quickly achieved consensus. \"We got a handful of other humanitarian organizations to come in, too,\" Muller says. \"Human Rights Watch and Physicians for Human Rights in America. Handicapped International in France. The Mines Advisory Group in England. Almost overnight, we pulled together and said, 'There ought to be a ban.' And from that sentiment alone, we were able to start galvanizing concern.\"\nIn early October 1992, Muller and the directors of the other humanitarian groups convened in New York. There, over the course of a single day, they drew up a mine-banning agenda. Back in Washington, Muller was working with Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont on the international coalition's plan. Muller knew that Leahy was likely to be receptive. In 1989, with money from the foreign aid budget, the Senator had established a War Victims Fund to purchase prosthetic devices for wounded civilians in Mozambique, Uganda and 10 other countries; and as chairman of the Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittee, Leahy had seen the toll that land mines take. \"Leahy's been great,\" Muller says. \"He went to the House and found a sponsor there, Lane Evans, and together, in a month, they rammed through a one-year moratorium on the sales and export of U.S. antipersonnel mines -- the only weapons law enacted in 1992.\"\nTo Muller, the immediate embrace of the ban is proof of how clear-cut a human rights issue this was. \"I mean, once we got Congress to stop and consider the problem, the moratorium was the obvious solution, and one that passed overwhelmingly in the House and Senate,\" he says. Recently, as the one-year ban on exports edged to a close, Leahy and Evans won a three-year extension to the bill, signed into law on Nov. 30. It is an astonishing feat, given the early reluctance of the powerful American arms manufacturers to play along. \"We've made our stand,\" Muller says. \"And other nations of the world -- Britain, The Netherlands, Italy, France -- they've all said they'll follow the American lead.\"\nOn Veterans Day last year, other mine-manufacturing nations of the world were called on to hold up their promises. Senator Leahy -- with the full support of Madeleine Albright, chief delegate to the United Nations -- stood on the floor of the United Nations and requested another one-year international ban on the sales and exports of antipersonnel mines. The act would augment the United Nation's own (often neglected) mining protocols and cuts to the economic heart of the problem. On Dec. 16, the General Assembly passed the resolution by consensus vote. Unfortunately, the moratorium is merely an expression of support for a global ban and carries no weight of its own, effectively enabling nations like Italy and China to continue exporting mines while their politicians debate the issue. \"I'm skeptical,\" Muller says. \"But I'll tell you, I'm dying to see how these mine-shipping nations act. We'll see who the humanitarian nations are.\"\nAT 10:06 A.M., THE MERCURY mercury in Rocky Rockwell's ground thermometer has risen to 55 degrees Celsius and Rockwell pulls a walkie-talkie from his belt. \"That's it fortoday, boys,\" he says, radioing to the sweeping teams inside the mine field. \"Let's pull out. Now.\" \nRockwell whistles loudly, then walks to his air-conditioned vehicle and honks the horn three times. \"That should get 'em out,\" he says, checking his wristwatch. \"Man, we hit stop time early today.\" He examines the cloudless sky overhead. \"Yep, gonna be a hot one this afternoon.\"\nALTHOUGH ACTIVE demining is done for the day, the morning's chores are far from finished. Over the next few hours, squads of mine sweepers -- lower-paid mine technicians subcontracted to CMS, including several Ghurkhas -- will enter the cleared zone of the mine field and pick up the disarmed mines. The mines will be counted and inventoried, piled in tight, squarish stacks a dozen mines tall and prepared for disposal.\nFirst, however, a little fun. A half mile south of where Rockwell stands, four stacks of mines retrieved over the past few days are ready for destruction. Each stack is the size of a family van and the top layer has been ringed with detonators and attached to four-minute fuzes. After lighting the fuzes at one-minute intervals, the detonation teams hop into their Jeeps and drive to a safe distance, half a mile away, where they wait for the detonators on each stack to blow and set off the mines beneath them.\nRockwell stares across the sand through his binoculars and talks elliptically about his future. CMS mine-sweeping teams, he says, will probably finish clearing this field in another day or two. At that point, his job in Kuwait is finished. Inspection squads will then be dispatched from the Kuwait Ministry of Defense to make sure it has been de-mined to their satisfaction -- a quality assurance period that has been known to take months. Recently it has become painfully obvious that, although the Kuwait Ministry of Defense granted two- and three-year cleanup contracts to clear the nation of mines, decades may pass before the country is 100 percent safe. By then, Rockwell will be far away. \"I'm looking forward to going home to California for a while,\" he says. \"Getting back to my consulting before I go on my next assignment. I'm thinking of rewriting the Schiebel owner's manual, too. We've got 85,000 hours with these things. We understand them, and the owner's manual is inaccurate or under-informative about a lot of stuff.\"\nRockwell gazes back through his binoculars. \"Here we go,\" he says as the first stack of mines explodes. In an instant, a roiling orange fireball a quarter-mile across has risen into the sky. A second later, a raging crack shudders the thin, dry air, rumbling deep into everyone's chest. Then, as quickly as the flame climbed from the earth, it is gone, replaced by a slim, mile-high plume of gray-brown smoke. \nWhere Rockwell's next mission will take him, he doesn't know. Like all CMS employees and subcontractors, he's waiting to hear whether the company has been awarded a several-million-dollar contract from the United Nations to clear roads in Mozambique. But if CMS isn't awarded that deal, Rockwell says, there will doubtless be other assignments. He leans against his car and watches the smoke dissipate. \"I think of the number of mines already in the ground and I know there'll always be work for me,\" he says. \"CMS has been talking to governments in southeast Asia and Africa. There are mine fields to clear in El Salvador and Somalia and Cambodia. The mines in the former Yugoslavia . . . they'll all have to be pulled up someday. If I want, I'll be able to work until I'm an old, old man.\"BUSINESS IS BOOMING\n Unexploded land mines are a global hazard, killing or maiming more than one person every hour. They also represent a novel source of income. Thanks to nearly $1 billion in clearance contracts offered by Kuwait after the gulf war, plus dozens of smaller contracts underwritten by the United Nations, about 20 companies specializing in mine and ordnance clearance have sprung into existence in recent years.\nSome of the companies, like the British-based Mines Advisory Group, are commercial arms of humanitarian agencies. By stressing their ability to supply both disaster relief and de-mining expertise, these nongovernmental organizations gain an edge in the scramble for United Nations contracts. In 1991, several Norwegian ex-military technicians teamed up with a humanitarian group called Norwegian People's Aid, an alliance that won them a $3.5 million contract to clear mines in Cambodia. \n\"It's not exactly a level playing field,\" says H. F. (Chick) Mixter, president of Explosive Ordnance Disposal World Services, a fully commercial mine clearance company in Fort Walton Beach, Fla. \"It appears that these companies go to the U.N. saying they're humanitarians, then they accept commercial contracts.\" Such arrangements also harbor potential conflicts of interest, putting agencies in a situation where mercenary concerns could supersede humanitarian ones.\nBy most accounts, the fastest, most reliable (and most expensive) mine clearance is provided by the wholly commercial companies. In the United States alone, more than five ordnance-clearing ventures now exist.\nUXB International, a company with 125 employees based in Chantilly, Va., failed to win a de-mining contract in Kuwait but prospers by cleaning up former United States military sites and artillery ranges. In addition to clearing mines, E.O.D. World Services and CTA Environmental, based in Norcross, Ga., thrive as talent agencies, hiring bomb disposal technicians away from the military and then subcontracting the manpower to companies like UXB and Conventional Munitions Systems. Ronco, a Berkeley, Calif., company, has carved a niche for itself by being the first to use mine-sniffing dogs in conjunction with metal detectors.\nIn some cases, commercial mine clearers double as weapons manufacturers or developers. Sofremi, a French company that in 1992 won a $111 million contract to clear mines in Kuwait, is a partnership between the French Interior Ministry and four French defense contractors; it was established in 1986 to help the French Government export arms.\nCMS started out in 1988 developing munitions for the United States military; like Sofremi, it entered the aftermath business with its bid to clean up the detritus from the gulf war and is now the largest ordance-clearing company in the United States, earning $100 million annually.\nCompany executives are acutely aware that they are working both ends of the arms industry and they emphatically deny any hint of impropriety. \"CMS does not make land mines,\" says Fred Dibella, a vice president for the company. \"We don't make arms that kill indiscriminately. We work to provide services, like ordnance disposal, that restore safety.\" Dibella adds that, in Kuwait, \"we have not cleaned up bombs or mines that were of our own manufacture.\"\nThat may be true, but broader scrutiny reveals more unsettling ethical contradictions. Commerical de-mining companies are often owned by multinational corporations, entities that in some cases make and sell arms -- including land mines -- through other holdings. CMS, for example, is owned by Deutche Aerospace, whose parent is the German giant, Daimler-Benz. Another subsidiary of Deutche Aerospace, however, is Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm, an arms manufacturer whose products include a new generation of scatterable land mines. (No MBB land mines were used during the gulf war -- a source of relief to CMS executives.)\nDaimler-Benz is not alone in offering cradle-to-grave battlefield services. Royal Ordnance, a London-based subsidiary of British Aerospace, both manufactures land mines and offers state-of-the-art mine and ordnance cleanup. In 1991, the company won a $90 million contract to help clear Kuwait, one of several countries in which the Royal Ordnance L-9 bar mine can be found -- a tidy, if darkly ironic, arrangement.DONOVAN WEBSTERA FIELD GUIDE TO LAND MINES\nL-9 -- antitank mine.

In America, the leading cause of death among black males between the ages of 15 and 24 is homicide. The unemployment rate in America for black males is more than twice that of white males. Even black men with jobs and higher education do not, for the most part, receive the same pay as white men or black women. Among recent college graduates with one to five years on the job, white men earned an average of $12.85 an hour in 1991, black women earned $11.41, white women earned $11.38 and black men $11.26.\nThe plight of black men in the nation's inner cities has been widely reported. Their experience, however, does not represent that of all black men. But the condition of the black male underclass remains the consuming preoccupation of many Americans, none more so than successful black men in America. The Times Magazine convened six of them, from a variety of fields, at a symposium moderated by Bob Herbert, an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times, to talk about it.\nEven most middle-class blacks are no more than a generation or two removed from poverty; it's probably impossible to be a successful black man and not see your inner-city counterpart reflected daily in the eyes of others and perhaps in your own bathroom mirror. As John Singleton observed in the round table excerpted here: \"I don't differentiate between myself and my cousin who just got out of jail.\" A black man need only try to hail a cab in New York City to be reminded that no amount of wealth, education or achievement can erase his blackness or maleness or sense of threat.\nThis breakdown of the inner-city black community and the marginalization of black men has accelerated in the last 25 years. One obvious explanation lies in drugs, especially crack. Another explanation, not so obvious, is the decline in manufacturing jobs with the shift to high technology. According to another participant in the symposium, William Julius Wilson, a professor of sociology and public policy at the University of Chicago, 48 percent of all employed black males, ages 20 to 24, were in well-paid, blue-collar, semiskilled crafts positions in 1974. By 1986, that figure had declined to 25 percent.\nJoblessness has a direct effect on violent behavior. According to an ongoing research project led by Delbert Elliott of the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence at the University of Colorado, during adolescence the rates of violence for black and white young men are virtually the same. However as the study tracks the same group as they mature, the statistics show that black men between 25 and 30 years old are four times as likely to be involved in violent crimes as white men the same age. The difference is employment, Elliott says. \"If you get a job, you quit your violence. If you don't get a job, you continue your violence.\" Employed black males and employed white males, have almost the same level of violent behavior.\nThe obstacles faced by black men are made even clearer by the extent to which black women have been able to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the civil rights movement. Black women have higher rates of completion at colleges and graduate schools. Their income is higher. On the average, black women who are college graduates have achieved income parity with their white counterparts. Black women remain afflicted by high rates of teen-age pregnancy, AIDS and drug addiction. But, on the whole, they have made real strides and, according to Dr. Alvin Poussaint of Harvard, \"There's a high level of anger among black men, be they low-income or professional, that black women . . . are given preference over them.\"\nThe symposium participants are:\nPatrick Day is the coordinator of the Multicultural Services Center at Texas Tech University in Lubbock. He is a graduate of Northwestern where, as a student, he was the assistant director of the university's cultural diversity project. He's currently developing a national association for African-Americans in higher education.\nKen Hamblin is a nationally syndicated radio talk show host and columnist, based in Denver. He owns two upscale sandwich shops in Colorado. He is also a pilot, photographer and fly fisherman. Hamblin grew up on welfare in a tenement apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.\nJoseph Marshall is a former teacher who watched with frustration as smart, lively students fell prey to the lure of street life. In 1987, he founded (with Jack Jacqua) the Omega Boys Club in San Francisco, which has so far taken 500 youths off the street and sent 108 to college. He is also co-host of \"Street Soldiers,\" a call-in radio program that is broadcast weekly in San Francisco and biweekly in Los Angeles with an audience now approaching 200,000. His callers ask tough questions about gangs, drugs and the pressure of being a teen-ager in the ghetto.\nHugh Price this summer became president of the National Urban League, which is trying to revitalize inner-city neighborhoods and raise the quality of life for their residents. He was previously vice president for equal opportunity and school reform at the Rockefeller Foundation.\nJohn Singleton is the writer and director of \"Boyz N the Hood,\" \"Poetic Justice\" and \"Higher Learning,\" to be released early next year. In 1992, he was the first African-American nominated for an Oscar for best director, and at age 23, was the youngest ever nominated in the category, for \"Boyz N the Hood\"; Orson Welles had held that honor since 1941 when he was nominated for \"Citizen Kane\" at age 25.\nWilliam Julius Wilson is director of the Center for the Study of Urban Inequality at the University of Chicago. He is the author of several landmark books on race and class including \"The Declining Significance of Race\" and \"The Truly Disadvantaged.\"\nBob Herbert, the moderator, joined The New York Times as an Op-Ed Page columnist in 1993. He has also been a reporter and columnist for The Daily News as well as a network television correspondent for NBC News.\nBOB HERBERT:The question is, who is responsible for the terrible situation that so many African-American men and boys are in? And who specifically must begin to turn that around, and how?\nHUGH PRICE: I'll offer one anecdote. A friend of mine, who is the president of the Cleveland Foundation, is part of a group of African-American men who are working with young males from tough neighborhoods. In one of the sessions, the kids said, \"If you're going to be helpful to us, you've got to tell us what your income is.\" And it took a while for the professionals to decide that they would reveal this information -- not just to the kids, but to one another. Several meetings later, they went around the table. One fellow said, \"I make $175,000.\" Another said, \"I make $150,000.\" A third said, \"I make $125,000.\" Do you know what the reaction of the young people was? \"How do you get over on $175,000 a year?\" Now where did they get that? They got that from a perception of one reality as a welfare and drug culture reality and the other reality as Shaquille O'Neal's salary. For all too many kids, there is no zone in between that makes any sense, that they're familiar with.\nJOSEPH MARSHALL: Let me just talk about what's changed since I was a kid in South Central, all right? The first thing that is important is that I had a steady job. I had a job, 11 years old, working in a corner store, making 85 cents an hour. No big deal, right? But you know what I believed very early? I believed people could make money legally! [ Laughter ]\nIt doesn't sound like a big thing, but that's a big thing. I believed early that you could make money legally. I got a stake in what you call the American work ethic. I always had a job, little bitty jobs, you know, all the way through high school, all the way through college. But it locked it in my head, you can do it this way! Brothers can't find no work today! You cannot find the jobs I had, when you started to believe that you can make it doing right. But right outside the door [ today ] , there's plenty of ways to make that dollar illegally. It's right there at your doorstep. You go outside, there it is. Here's the money!\nPATRICK DAY: A lot more people are going home after college and can't find jobs. We are talking about people coming out, with degrees. From my experience, people are very frustrated.\nJOHN SINGLETON: Well as far as I'm concerned, we were never meant to survive here in the first place. Everything that's happened in this country since we have set foot here has been geared toward our destruction. And it is by sheer miracle that we as a people have been able to survive. I mean you can go into a classroom of black boys and say: \"This one is not going to survive. This one is going to go to jail. This one is going to kill. This one is going to rob a bank.\" You can do that with any city, country, rural area in these United States.\nHERBERT: If we take your example of being able to go into a classroom of young boys and there would be X number who would just not make it, would not even survive, given the conditions as you describe them now, whose responsibility is it to turn that situation around?\nSINGLETON: Black people. It's not up to white people. I think that it should all be within the black community. We need to act the way other successful groups in this country have acted for centuries. Meaning this is our family, stay out of our business, let us take care of our business. And we will either live or die by that. Either we live by it and survive or we continue to have this industry of destruction going on. It's a virtual holocaust going on out there now. No one admits it, but that's the deal, you know?\nKEN HAMBLIN: If, as is true, from cradle to grave, light-skinned black people, dark-skinned black people, black people with straight and nappy hair, we've been told that racism abounds, white folks ain't going to give you a chance, there's no benefit in going to school, then we have been forewarned. It's like being prepared to walk through a door with three men, and getting a tip, \"The guy in the middle is the one that's going to shoot you.\" Damn it, you can't stand there and take a bullet between the eyes. You've been forewarned.\nSINGLETON: So what exactly are we talking about?\nHAMBLIN: If we are warned from cradle to grave that racism abounds in this country, then because we know as black people we are not going to get a fair deal, we should be the best educated. Because whitey ain't going to give us a break. We should be the most law-abiding because the justice system is racist and bigoted. But that requires hard work, midnight oil. Doing the right thing, staying the course. It's not a philosophy that is likely to gain me a lot of friends. Because it's the least romantic of all the paths.\nMARSHALL: I need to be on the street, working with the homies. I barely saw a .38 when I was a kid. Even in L.A., right? These brothers got weapons, they've got 9 millimeters, AK's, Uzis, Glocks, weapons of war on the streets, right in their hands. That's a huge difference between now and 25 years ago! These neighborhoods are like Beirut. And I'll tell you, crack -- ain't never been an agent like crack in our community. Crack is the only thing, chemical or otherwise, that has stopped African-American women from mothering their children. And I see it! Slavery didn't do that! You could separate a family in slavery and some other woman would take care of the child. You got something in our community now that stops the fundamental raising of the children.\nHAMBLIN: Crack and AIDS is not the most critical assault. We've been under that assault before. I can't think of the author's name, it's been racking my brain. It's in the book \"The Promised Land\" [ by Nicholas Lemann ] . It talked about Clarksdale, Miss. Talked about syphilis, talked about bathtub gin. And what he was writing about was black trash. Black trash. And in this room, we are debating the merits of including the values of black trash in the mainstream of the black effort. Now I know that's a hard pill to swallow because----.\nSINGLETON: Black trash?\nMARSHALL: What is black trash?\nHAMBLIN: Black trash. We all get access to a dictionary. If there's white trash, there's black trash. If there's a hot day, there's a cool day. I'm not here to ask for anyone's agreement.\nIt's my opinion. We are talking about a collectivism. Black people have failed because of the socialist collectivism.\nHERBERT: Ken, so we're clear, I think we need to get your definition of black trash.\nHAMBLIN: Black trash are the people who prey on us and then turn around and encourage us to sit here as intellectual wizards, film makers, columnists, talk show hosts, members of black organizations and talk about what whitey did to us. Now we talk about black people not getting a shot. I don't care what you say about white people; education is still free. And I was part of a generation that said we were going to take the schools from whitey because they couldn't teach us. Well, look at our schools today! Look at the S.A.T. scores. Look at the attitude: \"Yo baby, you trying to be white! How come you don't talk right?\" All of those things exclude you from the marketplace.\nMARSHALL: All I'm saying is somebody taught you. A lot of these guys, ain't nobody teaching them.\nHAMBLIN: Then they lose!\nMARSHALL: Agreed. We ain't disagreeing!\nDAY: We have not prepared black men to work and be employable in the 21st century.\nHAMBLIN: Then they lose! But you can't sit here and deny all of the effort and progress that people have been making!\nMARSHALL: Who has denied anything? Nobody is denying that.\nHAMBLIN: I've got ears. I'm sitting here and I'm listening. I'm squirming in the chair. And if we don't know why there are no jobs in Harlem, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, in northwest Denver, in South Central, in East St. Louis, then we are kidding ourselves. JIM CROW COLLAPSED. SO DID BLUE-COLLAR JOBS.\nHERBERT: Hugh, you would say that there are other reasons why there are not jobs.\nPRICE: Let me just say a couple of things. When the Brown decision [ The 1954 Supreme Court school desegregation decision ] was handed down, the big assumption was that there was a pretty robust economy. There was a white-collar economy and a blue-collar economy. The assumption that the blue-collar economy, that was robust coming out of World War II, would be there and that blacks would get to play [ their role ] once the Jim Crow laws collapsed. That assumption has not held true.\nWILLIAM JULIUS WILSON: If you talk with employers today, they will tell you that they prefer to hire women, white women, black women, immigrants, ahead of black males.\nJobs now call for more contact with the public. In previous years, black males would work in a factory or shop doing heavy lifting and labor. They didn't have to come into contact with the public. There is a perception that they don't relate to the public or the public doesn't relate to the black males. That the consumers would rather not have to deal with the black males.\nHERBERT: What are the reasons given for this?\nWILSON: There is an image that black men are threatening, that they're dangerous and that people would rather not come into contact with them. This image has increased in recent years and it carries over to the employment place.\nPRICE: The one intervention -- that we won't see but that I think would make a huge difference -- is factories moving back into the inner city offering today's equivalent of 1954 wages. But we are not going to see that, and we must all improvise with this new reality and try to figure out how to navigate it. School systems have not made that adjustment. And they especially haven't made that adjustment for us.\nHAMBLIN: We run the schools in our community.\nPRICE: Doesn't matter. We use testing and gatekeeping mechanisms.\nHAMBLIN: A white kid sitting in a middle-class, or low-income or black trash community is not stupid. And when he watches a black or Hispanic kid come through and run accusations of racism and thereby be excused from doing the homework or the quality of work necessary to keep up, that white kid plays out the same game. I believe that when whatever comes out of the ghetto, the underclass black or brown trash element of that ghetto----.\nSINGLETON: Please, you know----.\nHAMBLIN: I was on the street before you were born. Back off.\nHERBERT: John, your comments.\nSINGLETON: I'm sure that every week, you take out the trash. And you take out your trash, all right, unless you eat out all the time, O.K.? What do you do? You got eggs, you break the eggs, you put the shells in the trash can. You have a milk carton, you drink it, throw it in the trash can, right? That's called usage. O.K.? What you term as black trash, I call my brothers and sisters. They are going through the same kind of process as when you eat something and throw it out. That's usage.\nHAMBLIN: We're not talking about milk cartons. I'm talking about people that crank down the window and send young black boys, that you are lamenting about, home in body bags. We're not talking about eggshells.\nSINGLETON: I can shout louder than you.\nHAMBLIN: Go right ahead.\nSINGLETON: I'm younger than you.\nHAMBLIN: Go right ahead.\nSINGLETON: You are allowed to have your own opinion. But you say that you don't care. The brothers on the street don't care either. They would come in here and maul everybody in this room down. You part of the family, you know? You see my point? You don't care. They don't care.\nWILSON: In responding to Ken's comments, which I find somewhat bizarre because it seems to me that you have reached the conclusion that [ these people ] are trash and developed that way because of some individual shortcomings.\nHAMBLIN: Yup.\nWILSON: I would say that they developed that way because of lack of opportunity.\nHAMBLIN: I mean the young boy who develops that way soon learns by the kind of rhetoric that is fed in from both white and black concerned citizens who hold them to no standard. They are not stupid. By virtue of the fact that they are on the street today, they are the end of evolution, the most cunning creature in the jungle. They may not be called to Cape Canaveral to launch rockets, but they have every bit of human cunning. They adapt and metamorphose to the environment, and they prey on us while we sit here playing out this game.\nWILSON: What is so interesting is to talk to the young people who have some reason to feel hopeful, who think that they have a future out there ahead of them. Their behavior is entirely different from those who don't have that. What I'm saying is that a lot of behavior that you are talking about is a direct response of people not having a future, or feeling that they don't have a future, feeling that there is little ahead for them to look forward to.\nMARSHALL: Let me just say this, they're not told [ what their prospects for the future could be ] . This is what they're told: \"Yo! You got to do what you got to do. Got to handle your business. You gotta get your own. Ain't nobody doin' nothing for you.\" And without that information, they adopt to this other set of information.\nWILSON: Can you imagine what would happen if we had no unemployment rates, tight labor markets for a long period of time, what effect that would have on a lot of these youngsters in the inner city? Because right now, these youngsters, particularly those in high school, don't see the relationship between school and post-school employment. So it's hard to get them to study. Some of the obstacles they have to overcome, such as lack of information, is overwhelming.\nMARSHALL: Wait a minute, let me make my point. Because they're getting information, they're getting the wrong information. They're not getting the right information, they're getting the wrong information. You're not around to tell them the right information and the schools ain't around to tell them the right information.\nHAMBLIN: What happens when they look outside the neighborhood?\nMARSHALL: They don't look outside the neighborhood.\nDAY: I work on a college campus and I think a very serious point is that responsibility lies within our educational institutions. Black men have learned absolutely nothing about their history, or American history, if you will, as it relates to them.\nHERBERT: Given some of the problems that we have been discussing, what are some of the steps that people need to take to turn things around?\nMARSHALL: The first step and most important is, do you want to do it? Is it important to you to do something about it? Are the kids worth it? Because most people don't think these guys, or this issue, is worth it. I was in Israel when Arafat came to the West Bank. I'm seeing lifelong enemies, centuries-old enemies come together because they feel that it's necessary. They're coming together but not only that. This peace is being aided by the world. We are going to dump $100 million into Palestine because we know that if Arafat can't take care of his people, you can't have peace. What the world is saying is that that's important. I got war in the neighborhoods. I got brothers been banging [ fighting in gangs ] for 25 years. Ain't nobody helping them. They don't have any envoys, no negotiators; there is no peace accord being signed in Washington or Compton.\nDAY: What has to happen is that every black person has to make a commitment to doing something about the plight of their people, all right? At the core, it has to be black people. [ If we look to anyone else ] , we are absolutely fooling ourselves.\nMARSHALL: The first thing you got to say is that it's worth it. Now a lot of individuals are doing that and the individual can get results. I got plenty of results. I got plenty of homies never looking back. Bring them in here and you would swear they never shot people or sold dope. But what was important was that somebody said it was important for them to change.\nDAY: Every black person has got to be able to answer the question \"What are you doing?\" Until everybody can say that I have my hands on a young black person and doing X, Y or Z, we will never get there. You can't do that sitting around and talking. It's a matter of putting your hands on somebody and saying, \"Here is what you need to do to function in a modern world, a technological society.\" But it's got to be a hands-on thing. It's got to be hands-on.\nMARSHALL: That ain't stupid. See, kids ain't stupid.\nIT'S NOT JUST BLACK MEN THAT ARE SUFFERING MARSHALL: That's like people following Harriet [ Tubman ] out of slavery; a lot of them want to get out. They just don't know how to do it. I'm not saying all of them are going to come out. Some of them got so much scar tissue on them, there is so much anger, fear and pain in a lot of these brothers that you know there is just too much there for some of them. But a lot of them will follow you and if you take the time, you can get some of those with a lot of garbage in them, because I've seen that happen, too.\nHAMBLIN: I worked hard to come across that bridge from Brooklyn. I worked hard to move away from Fulton Street and Nostrand Avenue, where the dope dealers and hookers and prostitutes were. I'm not going to give up my right of access to the system, by being forced to select and live with people I don't want to live with.\nMARSHALL: It's really no different than physical slavery. Harriet went into the plantation and she said, \"I can take you to the North.\" That's how most black people got free, all right? She led them out. They followed the North Star and she went back by herself, no posse and there were black people then, that didn't want to leave physical slavery! She said: \"I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back.\"\nSINGLETON: And the next time they'll be ready.\nMARSHALL: I have seen results. I can give you plenty of them. But the main issue is the effort.\nWILSON: I have to disagree. I don't disagree entirely but I want to make this point. I think its important to get black people involved in helping black men, disadvantaged black men, recover. No question about that. But it can't be black people alone.\nMARSHALL: And! Don't say but. Say and!\nWILSON: O.K. And----.\nMARSHALL: There you go, say and. You're right!\nWILSON: I think it can't be an effort that's directed solely at black males. It has to be a comprehensive program that involves different segments of society and not just blacks. I'm talking about programs that involve the interaction of the private sector and the government sector, people at the community level and people representing various institutions designed to improve the chances in life of various Americans. The question is whether or not it's possible in this day and age.\nSINGLETON: Nobody is going out of their way to push black people forward. It's not up to white people or anyone else to do that. It's up to black people to do that in the long run.\nWILSON: I think that somehow we've got to change the rhetoric that we use to talk about these issues. The rhetoric has to emphasize things that people have in common. It's not just black men that are suffering a great deal. It's also the case that a lot of people are experiencing economic marginality. Not only the so-called underclass, but also the working poor, white and black and even middle-class people.\nSINGLETON: The white trash too, Ken.\nWILSON: Even middle-class people are experiencing a decline in their real income. So what I'm saying is that if this thing is going to be turned around, the nation is going to have to take a different approach toward these kinds of problems. In order to generate the kind of support that you need, you have to discuss problems in a way that resonates with different segments of the population.\nDAY: Let me jump in. At some level, I agree with you. But I think that a trap we run into sometimes is thinking that our problems have to be solved in the context of other people. I think at some point we've got to come home, sit down and talk about how to clean up the house. Then I think we can introduce a broader program. But that initial step has to be at home and it has to be with us.\nPRICE: As we think about the problem, I think we've got to distinguish between those things which we have to work on as individuals and as members of the community. I think we've got to make an unequivocal commitment to develop our children for the 21st century. We've got to know what that entails and we have just got to go for it. And most parents, including most middle- and upper-income parents don't even understand that. . . .\nDAY: Yes, sir. They're not prepared for that.\nPRICE: In addition to the parents, we need to put caring adults in the lives of kids. I love mentors, but mentors aren't good enough. We in the Urban League have talked about the idea of youth development funds. We would go into the African-American middle class, and by that I don't mean status, I mean the ability to give. We are going to go into our community and say, \"Everybody, you got to put up $500 or $1,000 per year on the table to pay the salaries of the youth workers who are going to be there in the lives of kids every day.\"\n[ At the Rockefeller Foundation ] I worked with the National Guard on something called the National Guard Youth Challenge Corps, which has taken dropouts off the streets and put them through a six-month residential program. This program is on military bases. Over 70 percent of those who enter the program complete it. And of those who complete it, over 70 percent are coming out with their high-school equivalency degrees. And over 80 percent of those who get G.E.D.'s, in the early run of the demonstration, are either in two- or four-year colleges or in job training. What the military has and has always had that we don't use on the domestic side of the equation is fast track, no-nonsense skill training. Deep understanding of human development and motivation. Very interesting, finely grained incentive systems. So that they say to a young person, \"If you can't see way over the horizon, come on a journey with us and we are going to take it step by step.\"\nHAMBLIN: The bottom line is that we can sit here on the 10th floor of The New York Times building. We can sit on campus in Texas, or Chicago, wherever we want. Until we break down that wall to let a black girl know in Oakland that it's O.K. to pursue an opportunity that will take her away from Oakland and not be called a race traitor or sell out or whatever, then we are spinning our wheels.\nPRICE: Well, those things are happening. Girls are looking outside, boys are looking outside. By the millions. And others aren't.\nMARSHALL: And they can handle \"sellout\" and \"punk\" and all that stuff. They learn how to handle it.\n'MOST BROTHERS GOT US ALL SCARED' HERBERT: What are the prevailing images of black men in America?\nSINGLETON: Wait, wait. Just stop before you even start. We know the images of black men in America. What we need to concentrate on is----.\nHERBERT: You are a very significant person to talk about this because you deal in images.\nSINGLETON: I don't want to sit here and tell you all the images of the dangerous black man in America because I don't want that to be written. I make a living making pictures. I try to have a strong black man in every picture that is responsible for other black men. Younger, older, whatever. I've made three films now, one comes out early next year [ \"Higher Learning\" ] . I had a black father in my first film, \"Boyz N the Hood,\" who tried to make sure that despite all the adversities outside of the home, he would be there for his son and teach him what he needed to know to become a man. And that at a certain point the son had to make his own decision of what type of man he's going to be. In my second picture, I had a young black father who took his daughter away from the mother who was messed up on drugs. And in this new picture I have a young man in a university who comes up against a conservative kind of brother and in the end learns that they have a bond.\nPRICE:What we have said in the Urban League is that these black folks who have moved out of the village have got to keep paying taxes. Basically we've got to help people connect the dots between the fact that if we don't make the investments in rerouting young male and young kids growing up in poverty from the lives that they're headed to, all of us are going to sit around and moan about the quality of life and the fact that crime is going into the suburbs.\nSINGLETON: Our children need assets like technology that will lead us into the next century. And they need to learn that it's cool to learn this technology. That it's cool to learn how to use a computer. Enough of basketball. It's about learning how to use this stuff.\nWILSON: If the young people know how to use it and become more hopeful about their future, you'll see an entirely different response in the classroom. And an entirely different response in the neighborhood. Kids who believe they have a future behave differently from kids who don't think they have a future.\nMARSHALL: You're saying that kids need to believe there is a future. Hey, you just want to live. I mean brothers tell me all the time: \"Damn! I made it to 21.\" So you know life, liberty and peace is what I call it. I don't even use the pursuit of happiness. I just use peace. To me that's the first question: Is it worth it to make the effort?\nHERBERT: You have kids packing guns----.\nMARSHALL: Yeah.\nHERBERT: Who are willing to shoot other kids.\nMARSHALL: Yeah.\nHERBERT: What are you going to do to stop that?\nMARSHALL: I can talk them out of it. I have talked them out of it.\nSINGLETON: It's a mental state.\nMARSHALL: I have talked brothers out of packing guns because somebody told them that's what they should do. Nobody has challenged them enough to show that, number one, what they're doing isn't going to work and that there are other alternatives. Mostly it's just a matter of being there to say something to them in the first place. Most brothers got us all scared.\nSINGLETON: Right.\nMARSHALL: I mean they do! We're afraid of them. We are afraid to engage them, just the process of engaging them. . . . You know what I think the Uncle Tom stuff comes from? That means you don't want to deal with me.\nSINGLETON (Looking toward Hamblin): You don't care!MARSHALL: You don't give a damn about me! So if you don't give a damn about me, I'm going to call you Uncle Tom. What they're really saying is that nobody is willing to engage me, O.K.? So the process of engaging them, getting involved in their lives, saying \"I'm not afraid of you\" is a powerful thing. It's a powerful thing to say to a child that's not biologically yours----.\nSINGLETON: I agree.\nMARSHALL: To say that I will be [ between ] 1 to 100 percent parent to you. Or 1 to 100 percent friend to you. The biggest challenge I had when I started working with kids outside of teaching was that I didn't have an angle. They don't live around genuine people. They live in a predator's world. They've been prey since they were little. I mean kids go out into the street and become prey and they turn into predators.\nHAMBLIN: Simple. Wonderful method and policy of collectivist thinking. Hope is limited. Kids packing guns, out-of-wedlock births. John started to come around to it. I'm still stuck there. What do we do?\nHERBERT: We need you to tell us what to do.\nHAMBLIN: What do we do to help get black boys and girls, young men and women, out of failing ghetto communities so that they can look beyond those boundaries and find hope?\nHERBERT: Answer your question.\nSINGLETON: What do you do to keep the ghetto community from being a ghetto community?\nHAMBLIN: Bring hope back in.\nMARSHALL: I ask them: \"What do you want? What would you like to have? What do you want to be?\" Oh, O.K. Let's see how we can get there. It could be a job, it could be a college education. It could be a pair of shoes. Now I'm going to tell you what happens along the way. They become realistic. They become realistic in their expectations.\nThey say, \"I need money.\"\nWell, how much do you need?\n\"I don't know, I just need money. I feel like I have nothing if I ain't got no money.\"\nHAMBLIN: Why? Why?\nMARSHALL: I help them say: \"Oh, I need $50 a week. I need $20 a week. I need $100 a week.\" Well, maybe money is not really that important. They begin to change.\nHERBERT: You are engaging them. Who else needs to do it?\nMARSHALL: Anybody who wants to. You can do it one on one. I have a radio show, \"Street Soldiers,\" in two cities that reaches 200,000 kids. This is specifically using media to combat violence rather than how it often contributes to violence. In this room, like I'm talking to you, they listen to me. It's amazing that they will actually call in and say, \"Look, I want out. How do I get out?\" 'GET THEM OUT OF THERE!'\nHAMBLIN: I am telling you that meaner than any Simon Legree, any slave master, there is a grip, an iron wall, around ghetto communities. South Central, Watts, East St. Louis. And I'm saying the first step to saving those black kids is to say to them: \"There is a shot. You can be the next John Singleton. You can, in fact, be the next director of the Urban League.\" But you've got to take them away, you've got to bust up that black reservation. Whenever I talk about that, I get the names, the Uncle Toms.\nMARSHALL: Yeah, but could you explain what you mean by \"bust up the reservation,\" bust up the ghetto? I got to understand what you mean by bust up----.\nHAMBLIN: I'm telling you that when you find kinds coming from a certain environment, whether they're getting pregnant with their third child or whether or not they're young boys such as portrayed in John's \"Boyz N the Hood\"----.\nMARSHALL: What do you mean by \"bust up\"?\nHAMBLIN: Break it down. Tell them that they can go away to college.\nMARSHALL: Oh, O.K. That's no problem.\nHAMBLIN: Get them out of there!\nDAY: First of all, when we talk about busting up the black community----.\nHAMBLIN: Ghetto! The black community is not the ghetto.\nSINGLETON: When we talk about the family, we are talking about the nature of relationships between black men and black women. From age 1, black women are taught that black men are nothing. Black men are taught to take their frustrations out on black women. Black men and black women and black people are at war with everything around them.\nMARSHALL: To me, [ the solution ] is real easy. Be a family member.\nHERBERT: But it's easier said than done, isn't it?\nMARSHALL: No, it isn't! I'm putting 108 kids through school myself. Me. None of them are biologically related to me. I'm not saying everybody has to put [ kids ] through college. What I did make was a commitment to be a family member. What that means is if I see a kid on the street doing something wrong, I'm going to tell him he's wrong. That's family. That's what I would expect somebody to do for my kids. I'm going to do that for everybody else's kids. This whole notion of expanded family, that it takes a whole village to raise one child, has always worked. I go back to Harriet Tubman. That was one individual. We honor this woman. We honor Malcolm. We honor Martin. Those were individual efforts so I'm not looking for any grandiose plan. SAVING ONE MEANS SAVING FOUR\nMARSHALL: I got this thing about family. When I save one, I save four. That's the way I figure it out. The brother. The brother, or brothers he was going to shoot. The girl he was going to impregnate. And the baby he was going to bring into the world. So I never say one, I say four. So the grandiose plan is very simple, but not easy. See that's the point for me. My thing is, \"Are you willing to do it?\"\nWILSON: Take a white or black middle-class family and strip them of all their resources to make them comparable to an inner-city family. Put them in one of those dangerous neighborhoods where the parents have to worry every day about what's going to happen to their children. Where they have to deal with the crime, the drugs and isolation. Where they can't depend on other families in the neighborhood because they're also isolated. You put any family in that neighborhood, stick them there, let them be trapped and see how successful they'll be over the long run in raising their children.\nPRICE: It's easy to proclaim that \"they\" ought to be responsible. It's easy to proclaim that folks ought to care for their kids; that we ought not to have out-of-wedlock births and so on. The question is whether you've got the support structures, the development structures there to help people navigate and make those calculations on a day- to-day basis. So that there isn't just a proclamation from the pulpit or the press.\nMARSHALL: In many ways, I appreciate this gathering. I gotta say that. Because this ain't the N.B.A. championships. [ Laughter ] It isn't the Super Bowl or the latest concert. Just the fact that we are here says that this is important enough to talk about.\nSINGLETON: I don't differentiate between myself and my cousin who just got out of jail or such-and-such over there who is dealing crack or this person that's working at McDonald's. I'm a black man living in America, right? And when I get up and I look in the mirror, despite whatever position I have and despite whatever job I have, I know that I go through the same thing that every other black man experiences. WILSON: You look at some of the youngsters in the inner city entering the first grade. Oh boy, they can hardly wait to go to the first grade. They're very enthusiastic about learning. They're very, very excited. By the fourth grade, they are totally turned off. What happens?"}, {"text": "Blue Helmets, Empty Guns\n1994-01-02T05:00:00.000Z\nOn a hazy October day, the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, steps off a chartered jet at the airport of Maputo, the capital of Mozambique. He moves patiently down the weathered red carpet, shaking hands with the assembled ambassadors and dignitaries. A phalanx of Mozambican soldiers snaps to attention and a band harrumphs through a martial tune. Beyond the ambassadors, a dozen singing groups wait their turn to perform. Mozambique, which gained its independence from Portugal in 1975, has never before been visited by a United Nations Secretary General.&#xa;\n&#xa;As I watch Boutros-Ghali, I can only wonder at his thoughts. He is stone-faced much of the time, especially in public. He walks stiffly, with his head pushed forward, which makes him look shorter than he is. He will laugh when a laugh is called for. It&#x2019;s a charming, lit-up laugh, often accompanied by a friendly grab at the arm of his interlocutor. But then he quickly folds the laugh up and returns to impassivity.\nHis agenda for this 10-day African tour is extraordinarily full &#x2014; and packed with potential catastrophes. On the way to Mozambique, he held meetings in Egypt and Djibouti to discuss regional support for a political settlement in Somalia. In Maputo, he hopes to jump-start negotiations between the Government and Renamo, an insurgency group, that have stalled for a year.\nHe is also scheduled to meet with his special representatives from South Africa, which is looking increasingly unstable, and Angola, which is a bloody nightmare. Then he is heading for Nairobi, which has had an influx of refugees from Somalia. After that, he goes on to Somalia itself, where Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid is planning to demonstrate against him and presumably, if the opportunity arises, shoot him.\nWorse, someone in the United States Government has chosen this moment to undercut him publicly. The day before his arrival in Maputo, The Washington Post reported in a front-page article: &#x201C;The Clinton Administration, increasingly unhappy with U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, is pressing him to cancel a visit to Mogadishu on the grounds that his unpopularity among Somalis could provoke demonstrations or even a breakdown in the current truce between U.N. forces and militia leader Mohammed Farah Aidid.&#x201D;\nFor the past several years, Washington has seemed increasingly plagued by leaks, but this one is particularly stinging. One wonders what its purpose is, since anyone who knows Boutros-Ghali even slightly knows it will only harden his resolve. &#x201C;It automatically puts him in an impossible situation,&#x201D; notes Sir Brian Urquhart, a 41-year veteran of the United Nations who is a scholar in residence at the Ford Foundation. &#x201C;If he doesn&#x2019;t go, people would think he&#x2019;s some kind of poodle.&#x201D;\n&#x201C;Poodle&#x201D; is not a word that would normally occur to anyone who has had dealings with Boutros-Ghali. Bull terrier, maybe. Friends of his, like Nabil Elaraby, the Egyptian Ambassador to the United Nations, call him &#x201C;independent-minded,&#x201D; &#x201C;straightforward&#x201D; and &#x201C;self-confident.&#x201D; Others offer up &#x201C;abrasive,&#x201D; &#x201C;stubborn&#x201D; and &#x201C;thin-skinned.&#x201D;\nCertainly, in his two years of office, Boutros-Ghali has become the most high-profile Secretary General since Dag Hammarskjold, who died in a plane crash in 1961. Partly, this is because the United Nations is under more scrutiny, now that the end of the cold war has unleashed an epidemic of regional conflicts and the world is groping for some institution that might tend to them. But partly it stems from Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s ambitious vision of the U.N.&#x2019;s potential. &#x201C;Never before in its history has the United Nations been so action-oriented, so actively engaged and so widely expected to respond to needs both immediate and pervasive,&#x201D; he wrote in a 1992 report. &#x201C;Clearly, it is in our power to bring about a renaissance &#x2014; to create a new United Nations for a new international era.&#x201D;\nSince that report, Cambodia has negotiated a mine field of an election under United Nations auspices with encouraging success, despite a violent boycott by the Khmer Rouge. But during the same period, horrific civil wars have erupted that defy all U.N. peacekeeping efforts.\nIn Angola, elections for a new Government failed to prevent a return to the worst fighting of its long civil war. In Bosnia, proponents of &#x201C;ethnic cleansing&#x201D; have maimed, raped and killed at will. And in Somalia, a highly publicized peacekeeping operation widely viewed as Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s pet project has claimed the lives of 30 American soldiers and 91 U.N. forces &#x2014; the most casualties since 195 peacekeepers were killed in the Congo in the 60&#x2019;s &#x2014; not to mention hundreds of Somali civilians.\nFairly or not, when an institution comes under a cloud, the lightning strikes the man perched on top.\nThe Secretary General should not have taken a prominent role in the Somali conflict to begin with, some critics contend. As Egypt&#x2019;s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs between 1977 and 1991, he had extensive dealings with Mohammed Siad Barre, the dictator whom Aidid helped overthrow. No one is calling for Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s removal, but some United Nations watchers are saying, off the record, that they are glad he intends to serve only one five-year term.\nWith his performance and even his character under fire, on this bright Sunday afternoon in Maputo Boutros-Ghali probably feels in need of a tangible victory. By now he has reached the singing groups. One by one they spring to life, clapping and dancing. Boutros-Ghali and his small entourage step off the end of the carpet, fold themselves into black Volvos and Mercedeses and speed away.\nEveryone I have spoken to in Maputo has discounted the possibility of future ethnic clashes in Mozambique. I am not an expert on the country, but I know that the Government leaders are mainly from a southern people called Shangaan and their military men are Makonde from the north, while much of the Renamo leadership derives from the Ndau people in between. I also know that President Banda of Malawi, some of whose people belong to the same tribes as those across the border, has fished for a while in northern Mozambique, hoping to pry loose a huge province with the newly minted name of Rombezia. Perhaps I think this is important because I have spent a lot of time in Yugoslavia, and I remember my first visit in 1989, when every Yugoslav told me the country&#x2019;s nationalist problem was a thing of the past.\nIn Maputo, the negotiations that the Secretary General is to help nudge along concern the 1994 elections. I have become wary of multiparty elections in countries with little national awareness &#x2014; and Mozambique has less than Yugoslavia did. Often, they turn into clarion calls for nations or tribes to coalesce around their parties and fight an electoral battle that is merely a dress rehearsal for the kind with guns.\nROMBEZIA. THE WORD IS A portmanteau of Rovuma and Zambezi, the two rivers that would define the northern and southern borders of the Malawian President&#x2019;s new province. I suppose the people living there would be encouraged to think of themselves as Rombezians.\nAbkhazians are trying to break away from Georgia and Ossetians are hoping to follow. Burundi has no Burundians, only Hutus and Tutsis, who remind the world of this by slaughtering each other by the tens of thousands. Now that we know about Tajiks, it&#x2019;s time to learn that there are Tajiks called Garmis and the non-Garmi Tajiks are killing them. If South Africa breaks up, are we going to have to start talking about Bophuthatswanans?\nOnce, in Bosnia, in a hill town of Serbs and Muslims, I met a man running a sweet shop who I thought was Albanian because he told me he was from Kosovo. But no, he was a Goranac. His people lived on a mountain ridge in the south of Kosovo and spoke their own language, which was not officially recognized because Macedonian hegemonists said it was a dialect of Macedonian. Meanwhile, Bulgarians insist that Macedonian is only a dialect of Bulgarian. The proud Goranac showed me his country on a map. It comprised eight villages.\nWelcome to . . . the New World Order? Please. It was bad enough that the phrase seems like a warmed-over Nazi locution and it has grown more offensively inappropriate with each new civil war, each new horde of starving refugees, each new failure of the international community to acknowledge reality. Even Boutros-Ghali uses the phrase on occasion, although he should know better, as he runs around the globe trying to stamp out the fires that rekindle behind him like trick birthday candles.\nThe United Nations used to have a mechanism for handling the intractable conflicts that were dumped on it. It was called &#x201C;peacekeeping&#x201D; and sometimes it worked. It was based on a few simple rules: peacekeeping forces were not introduced unless there was a peace to keep and unless all the parties to the conflict consented to their presence. They were to maintain strict neutrality and they were never to use force, except in self-defense.\nUnfortunately, the classic approach is no longer viable. At the beginning of 1992, there were 11,500 U.N. peacekeepers worldwide; today there are 72,000. The classic approach was an improvisation of the cold war. When there was a Soviet Union, the Security Council could rarely agree on U.N. involvement in a conflict, since the Soviet Union and the United States inevitably saw almost any regional crisis as one impinging on their vital interests.\nFor decades, everyone said that if only the cold war ever came to an end, the Security Council could begin to function properly. Well, here we are, and the Security Council is meeting every day and often twice a day, instead of once a month. It now agrees on the tougher issues, so forces can be sent where the bullets are still flying and where some of the parties don&#x2019;t want them. This is the kind of engagement the charter foresaw, under its chapter dealing with threats to international peace and security. But the charter also foresaw a U.N. army and a U.N. command, neither of which ever came into existence. Member states simply do not want a U.N. army. Boutros-Ghali raised the idea of one &#x2014; or, at least, designated standby forces in the various national armies &#x2014; in his 1992 Agenda for Peace and was greeted with a mixture of inaction and alarm.\nBrian Urquhart questions the usefulness of the Security Council&#x2019;s unanimity. &#x201C;I think that what has happened in the past year or two is partly because the Security Council can easily agree on almost everything. That I think is a major change and not necessarily a change for the better. The Security Council now in the most facile way can agree on resolutions and consensuses and chairman&#x2019;s statements about virtually any subject in the book. And then the various ambassadors will come out and look the cameras in the eye and say, We have decided so and so. This tends to be Wizard of Oz stuff. There are 28 resolutions now on Bosnia. Well, you would certainly never know it, if you wandered around Sarajevo.&#x201D;\nBOUTROS-GHALI campaigned hard to be the sixth Secretary General of the United Nations. The first U.N. chief, Trygve Lie, dubbed his post &#x201C;the most impossible job in the world.&#x201D; It may be that, although Boutros-Ghali and his predecessor, Javier Perez de Cuellar, insist that it is not. However, it is surely one of the most ill-defined: a combination of chief administrative officer of the United Nations and global diplomat with a fat portfolio whose pages are blank. When I ask Boutros-Ghali why he wanted the job, he replies: &#x201C;I believe that I came at a very interesting period. I would not have been interested to obtain this job five years ago.&#x201D; During his term, he says, he wants to turn the world body into &#x201C;a new instrument in the public opinion, a new instrument for the member states.&#x201D;\nNo one doubts Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s intelligence or the breadth and depth of his knowledge of political affairs. It is probably broader and deeper than that of any Secretary General before him. Born in 1922 into a wealthy Coptic family of Cairo, he has degrees in law, economics and political science at the Universities of Cairo and Paris. He taught international law at Cairo University for 30 years and wrote 31 books on international law and political science. His grandfather was Boutros Ghali, modern Egypt&#x2019;s only Christian Prime Minister, who was killed by a Muslim assassin in 1910 (to honor him, the family adopted his entire name). In 1977, Boutros Boutros-Ghali was appointed Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, just in time for the upheaval caused by Anwar Sadat&#x2019;s visit to Jerusalem, and he was instrumental in negotiating both the Camp David peace accords in 1978 and the Israel-Egypt peace treaty in 1979.\nBut soon after he arrived at the Secretariat, in January 1992, the murmurings began: about arrogance, a high-handed manner, a certain unhelpful volatility. His snappish comment to the people of Sarajevo during his visit there a year ago &#x2014; to the effect that he could name 10 places in the world that were worse off &#x2014; is still referred to with shocked awe. When a dust-up with the Security Council, and with Britain in particular, caused Fleet Street to go after him with its usual cheekiness, he blew the quarrel sky high by saying, &#x201C;Maybe because I&#x2019;m a wog.&#x201D;\nYou would think reporters would love him for saying things like that, the way they loved Ed Koch. But I find the atmosphere in the press section of the United Nations headquarters in New York to be positively poisonous. The reporters there call him Boo Boo and Peter Peter. (Boutros is Coptic for Peter.) Some surmise that, coming as he does from Egypt, Boutros-Ghali is not accustomed to a critical press.\nIn private, Boutros-Ghali can be quite charming. People who have seen him only in public find this hard to believe. He is not a good public speaker. He keeps his eyes rooted to the text in front of him. He lumbers along in heavily stressed cadences, his head bobbing and his finger jabbing, so that he seems to be hectoring his audience. The effect is even worse in news conferences. He tends to answer questions with a Gallic expression of raised eyebrows and drawn-down mouth, which in French just looks French, while in English it looks like a suppressed sneer.\nIn any event, in January 1992 Boutros-Ghali had a tough act to follow. He assumed the Secretary Generalship at a time of unprecedented euphoria over the United Nations. During the last few years of Perez de Cuellar&#x2019;s tenure, says Edward Luck, president of the United Nations Association of the U.S.A., &#x201C;there was a series of successes: Afghanistan, Iran-Iraq, Namibia, Nicaragua, the accords in El Salvador. The U.N. just seemed to have one thing after another going its way. People went from thinking the U.N. could do nothing to thinking it could do everything.&#x201D; In 1988, United Nations peacekeepers won the Nobel Peace Prize.\nThis euphoria coalesced around Perez de Cuellar, a veteran United Nations diplomat from Peru who is often described as the opposite of Boutros-Ghali &#x2014; smooth, soothing and self-effacing or, as Assistant Secretary General Alvaro de Soto calls him, &#x201C;a diplomat from the embryo.&#x201D; Perez de Cuellar also has a useful mumble that allows him to trail off into unintelligibility whenever he gets to the tricky heart of a matter, so that his listeners can interpret his remarks to their several satisfactions. He was the unsung, unassuming man from South America who rose to the historical occasion and became a dragon slayer with a disarming dullness.\nBoutros-Ghali himself tends to discount the importance of the personality of the Secretary General. &#x201C;Very often people like to compare, &#x2018;Ah, you are more active than Perez de Cuellar or than Waldheim.&#x2019; I say: &#x2018;No, let us speak very justly. If I would have been of the period of Waldheim or the period of Perez de Cuellar, I would have done exactly the same. And if Waldheim would have been now at my period, he would have been compelled, even if he did not want to do it, to be more active. So, very often it is the period that creates the man.&#x201D;\nIn Paris, where he now lives, Perez de Cuellar declines to support that sentiment. In fact, he has misgivings about United Nations policy in Somalia: &#x201C;To turn the mandate into the hunting of a man &#x2014; I immediately have some doubts about the wisdom of this issue. It&#x2019;s easy to pass judgment when you&#x2019;re out of the house. But as a man who worked in the U.N. for many years, I really suffered when I learned that so many people were killed. The image of the U.N., which needs so much improvement, has suffered.&#x201D;\nStill, Perez de Cuellar shows a clear sympathy for the difficulties Boutros-Ghali is in. When I ask if he is glad not to be Secretary General today, he answers before I even finish the sentence: &#x201C;Oh yes, oh yes. I am not a masochist.&#x201D;\nBEFORE BOUTROS-GHALI&#x2019;S arrival in Maputo, I went to see his special representative, Aldo Ajello, in his office in the headquarters for Onumoz, a French acronym for United Nations Operation in Mozambique. U.N. operation acronyms sound like brand names for cold remedies (Unifil, Untac) or creatures fighting Godzilla (Unrwa, Onumoz).\nAjello clearly enjoys his job and has an impressive grasp of those details of negotiations in which, as people say, the devil lies. On a table in his office was a computer printout of a magnificent multitiered time line in which all the interlocking institutional and logistical developments necessary for national elections in Mozambique were represented by boxes and arrows in three different colors. Everything dovetailed prettily: the setting up of commissions and assembly points, the arrival of troops for demobilization, the selection and training of 30,000 men for the new unified army, the resettling of civilians with hoes and clothes and packets of seeds.\nThe problem was, none of it was actually happening. The General Peace Accord signed in Rome in 1992 had called for elections no later than Oct. 15, 1993, which happened to be the day I was sitting in Ajello&#x2019;s office, admiring his time line. The time line itself called for elections a year hence. Ajello insisted to me that this was still possible, but a lot of people were privately saying June 1995.\nMost observers principally blamed Renamo for the delay. They were soldiers, people liked to say, not politicians. They had no idea how to negotiate or compromise, which inevitably made one wonder if they had any idea how to campaign or govern. The Renamo leader, Afonso Dhlakama, is intelligent but deeply unworldly. Later, in New York, Boutros-Ghali tells me that part of his bargaining strength with Dhlakama came from this unworldliness, from the fact that Dhlakama was so thrilled &#x201C;the Secretary General of the United Nations spent one hour with him and had a tete-a-tete with him.&#x201D;\nOne of Dhlakama&#x2019;s early demands in the negotiations had been for $100 million to transform his guerrilla army into a political party. The United Nations had responded with a trust fund of $5.8 million for that purpose. Dhlakama said he needed some of that money for &#x201C;political consultants,&#x201D; because the Renamo leadership needed to be guided through the democratic process, but U.N. rules wouldn&#x2019;t allow payments to consultants.\nSince one of the main obstacles in the negotiations involved the timing for demobilizing the soldiers and guerrillas, Dhlakama had recently been floating the idea that perhaps they could hold the elections first and demobilize afterward. Ajello&#x2019;s response to that was brief: &#x201C;No way!&#x201D;\nOnumoz had only to consider the horrifying example of Angola, where elections had been held without demobilization. When Jonas Savimbi lost, he simply went back to war. The United Nations is sometimes blamed for this failure, but the election accord was worked out without input from the U.N.\nHolding an election in a country that has never had one, especially after 16 years of war, as is the case in Mozambique, is a delicate and complex process. Since neither side trusts the other, the composition of the electoral commission is both crucial and inevitably problematic. This, indeed, has been a major stumbling block. There are other questions. If demobilization does occur, how will a devastated economy absorb a large officers corps accustomed to a bourgeois life style? How do you prepare a largely illiterate population for national elections when many people can&#x2019;t name their current President &#x2014; Joaquim Chissano? How do you get them to the polls when there are hardly any roads? How can the United Nations, or anyone, possibly determine whether the two sides are really disarming?\nTo the last question, Ajello had a much more sensible answer than any that the European Community monitors in the former Yugoslavia ever gave me. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t even try,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I know very well that they will give us old and obsolete material, and they will have here and there something hidden. I don&#x2019;t care. What I do is create the political situation in which the use of those guns is not the question. So that they stay where they are.&#x201D;\nEven assuming you successfully reach the big day, there remains the question of whether a multiparty election is always a wise prescription in the first place. I suggested this to Ajello and he concurred: &#x201C;You get out from 16 years of war. Then you finally sign a peace agreement. What do you need? You need the highest level of national unity, of national reconciliation. What do we give them? An election, which is another conflict.&#x201D;\nAjello conceded that it might have been better for Mozambique to try five years of a government of national unity before any elections. But this was not the option chosen in the Rome accord. There, too, the U.N. was only an observer.\nAmericans tend to equate elections with democracy and their observers go home trumpeting a success as soon as the votes are counted. But elections can be meaningless if a country has no tradition of a legal opposition, or an independent judiciary, or a free press. Renamo, however, Ajello said, &#x201C;is not like Savimbi. Savimbi never considered the possibility of losing the elections. These people, they understand they could lose the election, and that&#x2019;s why they want to make sure that, No. 1, they will survive this election, and No. 2, that there will be another election, after a certain time, in which they can run again.&#x201D;\nONCE BOUTROS-GHALI arrives in Maputo, negotiations shift into high gear. Waiting to talk to him, I wander around Maputo. Under the flowering jacaranda trees, girls are pounding maize in wooden hollows and other children are playing with cars &#x2014; constructed ingeniously out of wire cages &#x2014; that rattle along on aluminum-can wheels. The pastel villas of this former Portuguese colony are crumbling. The cement high-rises are crumbling. Everywhere is the sweet, dizzy stench of garbage piled high in the hot sun.\nEven if the negotiations are going nowhere, Mozambique has at least enjoyed a year of peace, and the 6,000 Onumoz peacekeepers from Bangladesh, Brazil, Botswana, Italy, Japan, Uruguay and Zambia patrolling the roads and supply corridors can take part of the credit. Only part, because it has taken several months to get the troops in place, and during those months the peace held anyway.\nThe discipline Renamo&#x2019;s guerrillas have shown in holding to the peace accord has surprised everyone. People now routinely say they are far more disciplined than the Government troops. The suburbs of Maputo are no longer being raided and the Central Hospital has far fewer recent amputees. It still has some, because more than a million mines were strewn throughout Mozambique and dislocated people returning home have been stepping on them.\nAmong Onumoz personnel there are two theories about this year of astonishing peace. The first is that it is a solid achievement in itself, because it is getting Mozambicans accustomed to peace. Even if the negotiations go nowhere, people will be less likely to return to war. The second theory is that it is a problem in disguise, because it removes any need for the parties to negotiate seriously. Meanwhile, Onumoz is costing the United Nations about $850,000 a day.\nOn the last day of his visit, Boutros-Ghali calls a news conference and announces a breakthrough. President Chissano and Dhlakama have agreed on the composition of the electoral commission. They have also agreed to maintain continuous direct negotiations in Maputo until a date for the beginning of demobilization is agreed on.\nAfter the news conference, Boutros-Ghali boards a plane for Nairobi. On the plane, he looks tired. &#x201C;I believe that I&#x2019;ve provoked a kind of awareness of the possibility that the United Nations will not participate seriously in the operation in the case that they continue to create mutual difficulties,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;The stick is, Look, there is a competition all over the world. We are trying to obtain money now for Gaza and West Bank. We are trying to obtain money for Yugoslavia. And because there is no progress, you will be completely marginalized.&#x201D;\nYes, he is pleased, but he is also perfectly aware that the whole thing can fall apart tomorrow. Or it can make great strides for three months and then suddenly collapse. Or the Mozambicans might have their election and then go back to war. Recalling the Egyptian-Israeli negotiations of 1978, he says: &#x201C;I learned the Sisyphus myth, that you have to work, work, work, and you can return to square zero, and you must have the patience, the courage to begin again. This is essential. Otherwise you are not a good negotiator. Never give up!&#x201D;\nIT IS ON THIS AFRICAN TRIP that I begin to get my own sense of Boutros-Ghali.\nHe gives an impression of nervousness in interviews. He fidgets with pieces of paper, folding and unfolding them dozens of times. On the plane, a narrow crevice between his fold-down table and the wall often proves irresistible. While explaining to me some element of policy, he will be intently trying to jam a paper into that crack. It crosses my mind that his famous aloofness may spring from shyness. Another factor may be his imperfect English. He occasionally gets lost in the thicket of a sentence and has to hack his way out. &#x201C;He gets frustrated in English and tends to raise his voice,&#x201D; says Rolf Knuttson, a member of his office. &#x201C;It makes him seem angry, when he&#x2019;s not. He never raises his voice in French.&#x201D;\nHe has the deep intellectual pride of a man who spent decades studying and teaching in the bosom of a European culture that views intellectuals as a distinct and honored class. Once he feels he knows a subject, his confidence in his opinions seems unshakable. And he is particularly proud of his knowledge of Africa.\n&#x201C;The origin is one very personal emotion,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;My grandfather signed the famous agreement of 1899, creating the condominium, the Anglo-Egyptian-Sudan. And when I was a small kid, the kids were saying, &#x2018;Your grandfather has sold the Sudan to the British!&#x2019; For me, what did &#x2018;Sudan&#x2019; mean? O.K., you can sell a car, but to sell a country? So when I was a student, there was an excursion to Khartoum in 1942, 1943 and I asked to participate. That was my first contact.\n&#x201C;In Paris, I chose the studies on colonial law. Later, I published many essays on African problems, and even created a sub-department on African affairs. I followed with great attention the creation of the Organization of African Unity. I wrote many books in English, French and Arabic on this organization. I created the African Society for Political Science. I created the African Society for Political Law. And when I was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs in November &#x2019;77, in spite of the huge crisis of the Middle East, which was the visit of Sadat, I always find time to pay attention to Africa. At the time I was accused, the media was saying, &#x2018;Because Egypt has been excluded from the Arab world, she is trying to find another backyard, and Boutros-Ghali is paying attention to Africa.&#x2019; So when I come to Africa, I know the leaders, I know the background, I know the mentality and I am at ease with them.&#x201D;\nBoutros-Ghali&#x2019;s relentlessly formal view of the United Nations and his role in it is problematic. This Cartesian approach can result in inflexibility. For example, he will defend some action he has taken not on moral or practical grounds but on the grounds that he was given a mandate by the Security Council, and a decision by the Security Council represents &#x201C;the will of the international community.&#x201D; Therefore, he is executing the will of the international community. Q.E.D. There is, as well, a certain contradiction between his two views of himself: as the impersonal executor of the Security Council&#x2019;s will and as a forward-looking agent of change.\nYou rarely forget, in talking to him, that he was a professor for 30 years. He pursues questions down the various possible logical pathways and rarely agrees with what you say, not necessarily because he believes you are wrong but because the argument, like a mountain, is there and he must climb it.\nMadeleine Albright, the United States representative at the United Nations, calls this his &#x201C;dialectical&#x201D; streak and she doesn&#x2019;t seem to appreciate it much. His famous &#x201C;wog&#x201D; comment is probably attributable to this tendency. He tells me he did not personally believe his ethnicity was an element in the British press&#x2019;s treatment of him. But he does not regret the comment because he said &#x201C;maybe,&#x201D; and you cannot rule out the possibility, since surely I would agree there is such a thing as national prejudices.\nIn short, he is an academic, not a diplomat. In fact, he tends to look on the word &#x201C;diplomat&#x201D; as pejorative. &#x201C;If you stick to principles,&#x201D; he tells me, &#x201C;you are not a diplomat&#x201D; &#x2014; a startling comment from the world&#x2019;s top diplomat.\nA PHENOMENON OF THE post-cold-war world, says Shashi Tharoor, a United Nations peacekeeping official, is &#x201C;a new transcendence&#x201D; of the global news media. &#x201C;The media now shows us a situation in a manner that clamors for international response. So as the world says: &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t just stand there. Do something!&#x2019; the Council is obliged to consider what it can do. In the cases of the former Yugoslavia and Somalia, it has used the one available institution that has existed, has worked &#x2014; peacekeeping. But this has meant sending peacekeepers where there was no peace to keep. It&#x2019;s particularly ironic that peacekeeping has been taken and put into this &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t just stand there. Do something&#x2019; syndrome, because peacekeeping has often worked best when it&#x2019;s &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t do something. Just stand there!&#x2019; &#x201C;\nIn October, television and magazines drilled home the image of a man dancing in front of the burning wreckage of a helicopter on a street in Mogadishu. He was holding a twig, at the end of which dangled a twisted lump &#x2014; a torn scrap of an American soldier&#x2019;s uniform. The ghastly thin dancing man looked like Death and the sinewy scrap of uniform he was dangling before his laughing, gaping mouth might have been roasted flesh. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t just stand there. Do something!&#x201D; became &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t just stand there. Run!&#x201D; Washington was in full scramble. Congress was threatening to force Clinton to withdraw the troops immediately.\nOn Oct. 22, Boutros-Ghali flies to Mogadishu to show support, he says, for the staff in the field. Returning to Nairobi the same afternoon, he gives a news conference. A reporter asks him whether the United Nations is still trying to capture Aidid and he gives his stock answer. He has a mandate and his job as Secretary General is to implement the mandate.\nOn the flight out of Nairobi to Addis Ababa, Boutros-Ghali tells me that Aidid has captured all the attention because he is &#x201C;Zorro against Superman, David against Goliath. The press talked to Aidid and took photos of Aidid, but not a word was given to Ali Mahdi&#x201D; &#x2014; Aidid&#x2019;s rival. &#x201C;We said to Ali Mahdi, &#x2018;Why don&#x2019;t you talk?&#x2019; and he said, &#x2018;I give four interviews to CNN but they never produced them.&#x2019; So the image very often doesn&#x2019;t correspond to the reality.&#x201D;\nThe following day, after he has seen the news reports on his own visit, he has more to say. &#x201C;It was exaggerated, what was said everywhere. In Mogadishu, I have my report, because I have a whole team of Egyptians there and they would not lie. It was 200 small kids, making a manifestation. It was just less than 200 small kids who received money and burned a few tires in the middle of the road. And they make out of it a big fuss.&#x201D;\nLike most public figures, Boutros-Ghali is sensitive to bad press and, like most of them, he insists it doesn&#x2019;t bother him. He says it is an inevitable consequence of negotiating. &#x201C;Once you are involved in any kind of mediation, you must accept in advance that you will be accused of partiality. . . . This is the rule of the game &#x2014; that you have been created to serve as a scapegoat. In the case you are successful, you must disappear, to let the other people say, &#x2018;We have done this on our own.&#x2019; And in the case you fail you must accept that you will be accused of all the failures.&#x201D;\nThis is perfectly true, and yet it can be carried too far. If you are too aware that you will always be criticized no matter what you do, how do you recognize those times when you are being criticized fairly? I am never reassured that Boutros-Ghali acknowledges there are such times.\nAidid&#x2019;s dislike of Boutros-Ghali is well known. People at the United Nations say that when the American-led forces were in charge in Mogadishu from December 1992 through April 1993, The United States special envoy, Robert Oakley, was under strict orders from Washington not to incur any American casualties. So he was careful to stay on good terms with Aidid, the warlord who controlled the port and the area around the American headquarters. But, some American diplomats say, Boutros-Ghali entertained a grand vision of the U.N. rebuilding Somalia as a nation.\nHe kept calling on the Americans to disarm the clans. They declined (no casualties, remember) and handed the operation over to the much weaker United Nations forces, which had a Security Council mandate to oversee a March 1993 accord reached in Addis Ababa that dictated disarmament. The U.N. command made it clear they expected disarming to go forward and they also began to set up district councils that were supposed to be the fundaments of a new political structure. Naturally, because Aidid wanted to be the next dictator of Somalia, he felt threatened by this and started attacking U.N. forces.\nBoutros-Ghali seems not to have realized that his background would also be a major problem in Somalia. &#x201C;I think he made a bad mistake in not saying that because of his background and experience and the part of the world he&#x2019;s from, he should step away from Somalia,&#x201D; says a long-time observer of the United Nations who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. He cites a U.N. tradition of not putting peacekeepers or negotiators in a situation where there would be conflicting national interests. &#x201C;You had Perez de Cuellar and Giandomenico Picco running between Iran and Iraq. Well, that&#x2019;s not a bad combination &#x2014; Peru and Italy. If you&#x2019;ve run foreign affairs in Egypt, if you have strong opinions about the Horn of Africa, you should step away.&#x201D;\nInstead, when the first U.N. envoy to Somalia, the Algerian diplomat Mohamed Sahnoun, differed with his boss publicly on U.N. peacekeeping policy, he was unceremoniously ousted. And rather than staying in the background, Boutros-Ghali has gone to Somalia not once but twice.\nWhen he arrives at an African country, Boutros-Ghali likes to open his public comments with a reference to his long association, as Egypt&#x2019;s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, with the country and its leaders and how pleased he is to be visiting now as Secretary General. In the case of Somalia, the warning bells should have been clanging. But this problem hits Boutros Ghali right in his blind spot: he is the African expert. Being an intellectual, and not a diplomat, he finds the suggestion that he might know more than is good for his job absurd.\nNonetheless, everyone I speak with, both inside and outside the United Nations, agrees that the Clinton Administration and Congress have unfairly and rather shamelessly scapegoated Boutros-Ghali when they pinned the blame on him and his representative, Adm. Jonathan Howe, for the heavy-handed manhunt for Aidid that led to the Oct. 3 disaster in Mogadishu.\n&#x201C;The Oct. 3 operation was totally an American operation,&#x201D; says Edward Luck, of the United Nations Association of the U.S.A. &#x201C;I mean, not even the U.N. commanders knew anything about it. Howe apparently learned about it at the very last moment. There was no effort to coordinate it with the U.N.&#x201D; He remembers Senator Alfonse D&#x2019;Amato of New York getting up on the Senate floor and saying something like: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s those U.N. dummies. We can&#x2019;t put our forces under U.N. dummies. Look what they do.&#x201D; Well, says Luck, &#x201C;those U.N. dummies happen to be Americans. The Rangers are very aggressive guys and they go off and do the things that are dangerous and high risk.&#x201D;\nAsked about Washington&#x2019;s treatment of him, Boutros-Ghali is determinedly low-keyed. &#x201C;I have to take into consideration the contradictions of the member states. This is my job. You know when you are beginning to work in a shop, the customer is always right. You are selling a suit and I don&#x2019;t like it. You will not say, &#x2018;No, but the suit is good!&#x2019; No, no! You will say&#x201D; &#x2014; here he makes a gesture of submission and infinite patience, the bright minion endeavoring to calm his dim lord &#x2014; &#x201C;Yes, sir! We will change it if you want.&#x201D;\nThe Americans, he admits, &#x201C;complicate my job. The only consolation is that they are not the only ones who complicate my job. In August, it was the Italians. You see, if you don&#x2019;t have a philosophical attitude, you will not be able to do this kind of job.&#x201D;\nHelping him turn the other cheek was a formulation one might call the Useful Scapegoat Principle. &#x201C;The U.N. was created for whom? To help the member states. If member states are in difficulties and they can just put the blame on the U.N., in a certain way you are helping. I can give you an example related to my country. One year after the creation of the U.N., the Government of Prime Minister Noukrachi wanted the abolition of the treaty which was concluded between Egypt and Great Britain. Great Britain was not ready at all. It had other things to do in 1946 than pay attention to a treaty that was concluded in Egypt. The Government was in a very difficult position. Noukrachi decided to go to the U.N. And the Security Council adopted a resolution saying the two parties had to talk directly to each other, which means nothing. He returned to Egypt and it was considered the biggest victory. The fact that we were able to complain against Great Britain to the U.N. and that the delegate of Egypt was insulting the delegate of Great Britain in the Security Council, in New York, was a great victory. In other words, if the U.N. helps to diffuse the tension existing between two countries &#x2014; why not?&#x201D;\nIN NEW YORK, THE SECURITY Council seems locked perpetually in session, and on the 38th floor of the Secretariat Boutros-Ghali keeps a busy schedule of consultations with ambassadors, envoys and heads of state. Often, he doesn&#x2019;t return to his official residence until 8 or 9 P.M. and frequently goes to his office for more work on Saturdays.\nMeanwhile, in the austere halls outside the delegates&#x2019; lounge and the Security Council chambers, the agonies of the former Yugoslavia are a heavy, intermittent presence. Now and then, the President of Bosnia, Alija Izetbegovic, comes through New York and consults with the Security Council. Each time, he seems to be retreating further into an irreal world of principle. And each time he looks older and more tired.\nThe Croats threatened in September that they would not renew the mandate for the United Nations forces arrayed between them and the Serbs of Krajina, a region in Croatia, because the U.N. was not disarming the Serbs or helping restore Croatian authority in Serb-held areas. But then they allow themselves to be talked out of it, because if the forces left they would have to start fighting the Croatian Serbs again, at a time when they are getting along well with the Bosnian Serbs in their joint project of carving up Bosnia.\nThe Serbs representing the new Yugoslavia wander like ghosts through the halls and hang around the delegates&#x2019; lounge, because they have been denied the old Yugoslavia seat in the General Assembly pending a formal reapplication. They have failed to submit one, telling anyone who will listen that they have no control over the Bosnian Serbs or the Croatian Serbs.\nThe United Nations has gotten pushed and pulled into Yugoslavia by the familiar forces of a public demanding action and governments&#x2019; efforts to satisfy these demands by resolutions in the Security Council. Initially baby steps down the slippery slope, these resolutions have degenerated into empty promises of intervention. Kofi Annan, Under Secretary General for Peacekeeping Operations, has a flexible and sensible attitude about this problem. In describing the difficulties of peacekeeping in Bosnia, he stresses that Security Council resolutions more often than not get in the way. They tend to polarize the sides, as one group or another becomes obsessed with the perceived unfairness of a certain resolution. &#x201C;Forget the resolutions,&#x201D; Annan tells them. &#x201C;We know where we want to go. Let&#x2019;s figure out how to get there.&#x201D;\nBoutros-Ghali&#x2019;s reluctance to get the U.N. involved in Bosnia is well known. He is often quoted as having said that Bosnia was a &#x201C;rich man&#x2019;s war,&#x201D; but he insists he was misunderstood. He was, he says, referring to the amount of attention Bosnia was getting compared with other areas of conflict. He argues that since the European Community was already involved in the former Yugoslavia, he saw dangers in bringing in the United Nations because the parties to the conflict would then be able to play one organization off against the other.\nThe United Nations Charter directs it to rely on regional organizations when possible. Since the European Community is one of the richest regional organizations in the world, it might make sense for the community to deal with Yugoslavia and free U.N. funds for operations in areas where such groups are poor. The European Community, however, has declared itself incapable of acting without the U.N. umbrella.\nThen there is Haiti.\nIn early October, some Haitians yelled on the dock of Port-au-Prince that they would turn Haiti into another Somalia. They sent an American ship, the Harlan County, with 200 American and Canadian engineers and advisers packing. After the Harlan County left, the U.N. withdrew its observers from Haiti, the Security Council reimposed trade sanctions and the debate turned to how many Haitian children were dying each month as a result of the embargo.\nSome editorialists scoffed at the United States and the United Nations running from a few &#x201C;thugs.&#x201D; But haven&#x2019;t we been assured before that an operation, like the manhunt for Aidid, is only a matter of cowing a few &#x201C;thugs&#x201D;? Why are thugs easier to fight than soldiers? One can argue that thugs are harder to fight. Since they are not answerable to anyone, you can&#x2019;t pressure them politically. You can only try to find them and kill them, and in doing so you kill a lot of bystanders. The thugs, not being stupid, help you do this. You begin to lose support among the very people you set out to help, who start to look on the thugs as their defenders. And there you are, talking about your &#x201C;credibility,&#x201D; hip-deep in the muck and morally lost.\nThe withdrawal of the U.N. forces from Haiti, Boutros-Ghali tells me, was necessitated by Washington&#x2019;s decision not to dock the Harlan County. He shrugs and says: &#x201C;I return to my old theory. If the member states do not want to implement a resolution, we can do nothing.&#x201D;\nIF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO TALK about fulfilling the potential of the United Nations Charter, they ought to recognize that the charter was written by war-making countries. These were countries accustomed to the deliberate firebombing of major cities, whose millions of soldiers occupied Europe, North Africa and much of Asia. The Churchillian words of article 42 came easily to them: the Security Council &#x201C;may take such action by air, sea or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.&#x201D;\nThe framers of the charter were victors, with a clear and unembarrassed conviction that they had the right to dictate to other people what was good for them. One of the U.N.&#x2019;s first major acts &#x2014; a model of cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States &#x2014; had nothing to do with repelling aggression against one of its members or relieving a humanitarian crisis. It was the partition of Palestine, against the repeated protests of the Arab countries, member states all.\nNow, 45 years later, the Security Council has reactivated article 42, and the world seems to be surprised that it is a war-making mechanism. In April, the Secretary General established a Situation Center to keep tabs on the many peacekeeping missions around the world (see map on page 22). Temporarily set up in a building across the street from the Secretariat, the Situation Center itself is a large windowless room with desks and computer monitors. The military personnel from member nations are on 24-hour duty and are paid for by their own countries.\nThe problem these days when man-made disasters strike with increasing frequency is that not only do Americans have no apparent desire to fight wars for the sake of security in the Horn of Africa or humanitarianism in general, but they are no longer convinced of the inherent rightness of any project they undertake. And Americans are not the only ones who think this way.\nHowever, if the 184 members of the United Nations are serious about their world organization, they need to decide under what circumstances and in pursuit of what goals they are willing to suffer casualties. They need to acknowledge to their citizens that if they participate in U.N. peacekeeping or &#x201C;peace-enforcing&#x201D; operations, they will suffer casualties. They have to define what sorts of things affect their national security in that circle beyond the innermost one of direct attack and interruption of vital trade. They have to discuss what they are willing to do to protect those interests. And they have wrestle with a question raised by Margaret Thatcher in May: If Bosnia is not in our sphere of interest, should it be in our sphere of conscience?\nIn the United States, we have to invoke a more subtle range of lessons from the past than Vietnam (quagmire; do not engage) and Hitler (can&#x2019;t appease; engage). The Clinton Administration is currently trying to thrash out some of these ideas. A classified document recently making the rounds in Washington proposed that the United States support the use of force by the Security Council in cases of &#x201C;international aggression, a humanitarian disaster requiring urgent action coupled with violence, a sudden and unexpected interruption of established democracy or gross violation of human rights coupled with violence.&#x201D; If a U.N. operation is to include American troops, the document continued, more requirements must be met: most notably, American national interest must be directly affected and Congress must support the deployment.\nIn a recent speech to the Council of Foreign Relations, the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, set out to define the Administration&#x2019;s plan to replace the cold war doctrine of containment with a strategy of &#x201C;enlargement.&#x201D; It consists of four components: strengthening &#x201C;major market democracies&#x201D;; &#x201C;consolidating democracy and markets in states of special significance or opportunity&#x201D;; countering the aggression &#x201C;of states hostile to democracy and markets&#x201D; and &#x201C;pursuing humanitarian goals and limiting sectarian conflict in regions of greatest concern.&#x201D;\n&#x201C;American efforts to foster freedom must be tightly targeted and demand-driven,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;CNN is not a compass for American interests. We cannot act on the urge, rooted as it is in good intentions, to respond to every crisis.&#x201D;\nAs discussions continue on what constitutes &#x201C;national interest,&#x201D; people also need to agree on what they mean by &#x201C;the United Nations,&#x201D; since in different contexts they mean different things. When the public reads about something the Security Council has decided, it thinks &#x201C;U.N.&#x201D; But people in the Secretariat look at the decisions by the Security Council and think &#x201C;member states.&#x201D; When President Clinton said in his address to the General Assembly in September, &#x201C;If the American people are to say yes to U.N. peacekeeping, the United Nations must know when to say no,&#x201D; he was speaking to the Security Council, which authorizes those operations. But the United States is a permanent member with vetoing power in the Security Council, so the President was really talking to his own Administration.\nWhen critics charge that &#x201C;the U.N.&#x201D; takes six months to get troops into place after a peacekeeping operation is authorized, they seem to be referring to the Secretariat. But member states are slow to send their troops. The Secretariat would not have to wait for members to contribute troops if it had its own army, or designated standby units, as both the charter and Boutros-Ghali envision, but the member states refuse to authorize either of these things.\nMember states complain about the budget, but member states pass the budget. And the United States, with the largest assessment (it&#x2019;s based primarily on gross national product), can&#x2019;t complain it is outvoted by a bunch of little countries whose assessments are practically nothing because for years now the budget has been set by consensus.\nIn the case of Somalia, the confusion over &#x201C;the U.N.&#x201D; especially points up the dangers of not having worked out an agreement for American troops to serve under United Nations command. The Force Commander in Somalia, the Turkish Lieut. Gen. Cevik Bir, is United Nations. His deputy commander is Maj. Gen. Thomas Montgomery, an American. As Deputy Force Commander, Montgomery is United Nations. But as field commander of the American Quick Reaction Force, he reports to the United States Central Command in Tampa, Fla., so he is United States. Then there is Admiral Howe. He is Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s special representative, but he is also an American with extensive connections in Washington, which he used to garner support for his manhunt for Aidid. Is he United Nations or United States? The question cannot really be answered, and that is a problem. In its reluctance to put its troops under United Nations command, the United States cobbled together a compromise of confused responsibility that probably put its troops in more danger.\nAs for the Secretary General and his role, Boutros-Ghali not only carries out the Security Council&#x2019;s vague and sometimes tortured directives but he writes the reports on which the Council partly bases some of those directives. But to talk about &#x201C;Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s U.N.,&#x201D; as many do, is misleading. It is Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s Secretariat, not his U.N. And the personality traits that many complain about have more of an effect on morale in the Secretariat than they do on security in the world. His retreat over the policy in Somalia shows that it is just as much, if not more, Bill Clinton&#x2019;s U.N. &#x2014; which may explain why the U.N. seems adrift at the moment, since Bill Clinton isn&#x2019;t paying much attention.\nIn its role as guarantor of international peace and security, &#x201C;the U.N.&#x201D; is much more the Security Council than it is the Secretariat. But how coherent an entity is the Security Council? As a body with an intention and a will, does it exist any more than &#x201C;Europe&#x201D; does? The permanent five are all preoccupied with their own problems. Russia is busy rewriting its Constitution, electing its Parliament and fighting hyperinflation. President Clinton has had his hands full trying to pass his budget, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Brady Bill, a health care program. . . . China is the phantom of the Council. The three pillars of its policy seem to be negative: don&#x2019;t discuss human rights, don&#x2019;t mention Tibet and don&#x2019;t let Taiwan into the U.N. France and Britain are the most committed multilaterists. Unfortunately, they often disagree with each other. In any event, both countries have been preoccupied with serious downturns in their economy.\nThen there is the question of the Security Council&#x2019;s legitimacy as a representative of &#x201C;the international community.&#x201D; World War II was won quite a while ago. Germany and Japan both indicate that they wouldn&#x2019;t mind being permanent members, and the prospect of getting more money out of them for the cash-starved United Nations is inviting, although &#x2014; for the time being &#x2014; both are trying to pull out of their economic doldrums. But admitting them would only tilt the Council further toward the developed world.\nThere are proposals to include other powers in the Council, but who would they be and who would choose them? India seems an obvious choice, unless you happen to be from Pakistan. Nigeria is the most populous nation in Africa, but it is currently in turmoil. And do you give these new permanent members vetoes or would that hobble the Council again? These are probably insoluble political problems. The only way to come up with a more up-to-date Council might be to fight another world war and hand it once more to the victors.\nWith its haziness of outline, &#x201C;the U.N.&#x201D; becomes an irresistible target for blame when something goes wrong. Since the organization is, in a sense, everybody, it is also always somebody else. This feeds into, and off, a certain knee-jerk anti-U.N. attitude in some quarters in the United States that is a combination of simple nativism, a cultural distrust of government and a visceral hatred of bureaucracy.\nThere is a danger here. The United Nations is dependent on good will and good press. Countries are only too happy to have an excuse to withhold their assessments. And the U.N. not only has no army and no treasury, but it also has no constituency. If the end of the 20th century is teaching us anything, it is that nationalism is stronger than ever. The U.N. has no anthem to sing and although it does have a flag &#x2014; a map of the world &#x2014; at its center lies the North Pole, where no one lives.\nMY LAST MEETING WITH Boutros-Ghali is at 3 Sutton Place, the handsome Georgian manor near the East River that was built for J. P. Morgan&#x2019;s daughter and was donated to the U.N. Association in 1972 for use as the Secretary General&#x2019;s residence.\nBoutros-Ghali is at his most charming. He is more relaxed than I have yet seen him, either because it is Sunday and he is at home or because, after six meetings, he is getting used to me.\n&#x201C;The last time I saw you, in the London airport, you looked like this!&#x201D; he says delightedly, stretching stiffly back in his chair like a corpse, mouth open. (I had gotten sick in Africa, before proceeding to London.) He tells me a couple of amusing anecdotes about his negotiations for the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty and takes me on a tour of the residence.\nIn every room, there are ancient bronze birds from Egypt and Persia, which he has been collecting for years. He directs a light on them, so that I can see the intricate shadow-lines left behind by the long-vanished gold. He points out the Matisse and the Leger and the Bonnard that are on loan from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art. He waves at the Utrillo, which Leia, his wife, has picked out and which he does not like. He and his wife have a whole routine, which they seem to enjoy. He complains about her nagging or some wrongheaded decision she has made. But when she appears, a quite imposing tall blonde, he steps away, meekly draws in his head and says, &#x201C;She&#x2019;s the boss!&#x201D;\nBoutros-Ghali and I settle down for a few questions. Is the role that he frequently sees for himself as Secretary General &#x2014; that of the humble servant patiently taking knocks from an imperious master &#x2014; modeled on his experiences as a Copt in Egypt, as someone who, though wealthy and from a proud family, has had to accept that he will never quite belong?\nHe will have none of it. &#x201C;I never felt this during all the 68 years I spent of my life in Egypt. I never felt this at all, maybe because I belonged to the haute bourgeoisie. I have always had Muslim friends, Jewish friends.&#x201D; He attributes his ability to be self-effacing to the fact that he has been trained to do this kind of work.\nWhen I ask if he had difficulty adjusting to this role, for the only time in our talks he acknowledges that the humble servant occasionally blows up at the master who is not as bright.\n&#x201C;Even now, I am not good at this. The fact that I have so many troubles is that very often rather than keep quiet, I just say loudly what I think. I had trouble with the Israelis, during my negotiations with them, and I have trouble with many people, because on the contrary I am not enough trained to do this kind of thing. If you want a kind of auto-criticism.&#x201D;\nAnd is the United Nations going through a crisis of confidence right now, after the problems of the last three months?\n&#x201C;No, for me the U.N. has not changed. I am just saying that the U.S. as a major actor is passing by a crisis of less support for the U.N., period. What I am saying is, in my own interpretation, that this is tactical and not strategic. That they will return back to the U.N. and give the same support, after the crisis will get over.&#x201D;\nI bring up Mozambique. Have the negotiations continued to make progress after his departure? He is surprised by the question and brightens. &#x201C;Oh yes, yes! It is a success story! Which don&#x2019;t appear in the press! The press likes the return of Zorro!&#x201D;\nA few days later I call Aldo Ajello, Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s special representative in Maputo. He says that the Secretary General&#x2019;s visit has made great progress possible. The electoral law has been approved and 20 troop assembly areas have been opened, with the first groups of Government and Renamo fighters arriving just a few days previously, for disarmament and demobilization. Ajello thinks they might make the October 1994 deadline for elections.\n&#x201C;The fundamental decision made by Renamo since Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s visit is to give up the military option,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;The only problem now &#x2014; but it is a big problem &#x2014; is the financial problem. Renamo still wants money.&#x201D; Ajello is asking for a new trust fund of $4 million, to be set up under more flexible rules than the U.N.-administered fund they already have. &#x201C;But the money is just not coming. I am afraid to say, the international community is much more willing to fund war than peace. If this money doesn&#x2019;t come through, the whole thing will collapse.&#x201D;\nI hang up with the impresssion that Ajello and Onumoz have a tough, complicated job to do and that they seem to be tackling it as well as anyone can. And if it all fails for lack of a trust fund, who will be responsible? The United Nations-as-Secretariat, for the bureaucratic rigidity of the first trust fund for Mozambique? Or the United Nations-as-member-states, for the unwillingness to cough up a paltry $4 million for the stabilization of Mozambique?\nImpossible to answer. The only sure thing is, if Mozambique fails, fingers will be pointing, all around the circle."}, {"text": "Blue Helmets, Empty Guns\n1994-01-02T05:00:00.000Z\nOn a hazy October day, the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, steps off a chartered jet at the airport of Maputo, the capital of Mozambique. He moves patiently down the weathered red carpet, shaking hands with the assembled ambassadors and dignitaries. A phalanx of Mozambican soldiers snaps to attention and a band harrumphs through a martial tune. Beyond the ambassadors, a dozen singing groups wait their turn to perform. Mozambique, which gained its independence from Portugal in 1975, has never before been visited by a United Nations Secretary General.&#xa;\n&#xa;As I watch Boutros-Ghali, I can only wonder at his thoughts. He is stone-faced much of the time, especially in public. He walks stiffly, with his head pushed forward, which makes him look shorter than he is. He will laugh when a laugh is called for. It&#x2019;s a charming, lit-up laugh, often accompanied by a friendly grab at the arm of his interlocutor. But then he quickly folds the laugh up and returns to impassivity.\nHis agenda for this 10-day African tour is extraordinarily full &#x2014; and packed with potential catastrophes. On the way to Mozambique, he held meetings in Egypt and Djibouti to discuss regional support for a political settlement in Somalia. In Maputo, he hopes to jump-start negotiations between the Government and Renamo, an insurgency group, that have stalled for a year.\nHe is also scheduled to meet with his special representatives from South Africa, which is looking increasingly unstable, and Angola, which is a bloody nightmare. Then he is heading for Nairobi, which has had an influx of refugees from Somalia. After that, he goes on to Somalia itself, where Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid is planning to demonstrate against him and presumably, if the opportunity arises, shoot him.\nWorse, someone in the United States Government has chosen this moment to undercut him publicly. The day before his arrival in Maputo, The Washington Post reported in a front-page article: &#x201C;The Clinton Administration, increasingly unhappy with U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, is pressing him to cancel a visit to Mogadishu on the grounds that his unpopularity among Somalis could provoke demonstrations or even a breakdown in the current truce between U.N. forces and militia leader Mohammed Farah Aidid.&#x201D;\nFor the past several years, Washington has seemed increasingly plagued by leaks, but this one is particularly stinging. One wonders what its purpose is, since anyone who knows Boutros-Ghali even slightly knows it will only harden his resolve. &#x201C;It automatically puts him in an impossible situation,&#x201D; notes Sir Brian Urquhart, a 41-year veteran of the United Nations who is a scholar in residence at the Ford Foundation. &#x201C;If he doesn&#x2019;t go, people would think he&#x2019;s some kind of poodle.&#x201D;\n&#x201C;Poodle&#x201D; is not a word that would normally occur to anyone who has had dealings with Boutros-Ghali. Bull terrier, maybe. Friends of his, like Nabil Elaraby, the Egyptian Ambassador to the United Nations, call him &#x201C;independent-minded,&#x201D; &#x201C;straightforward&#x201D; and &#x201C;self-confident.&#x201D; Others offer up &#x201C;abrasive,&#x201D; &#x201C;stubborn&#x201D; and &#x201C;thin-skinned.&#x201D;\nCertainly, in his two years of office, Boutros-Ghali has become the most high-profile Secretary General since Dag Hammarskjold, who died in a plane crash in 1961. Partly, this is because the United Nations is under more scrutiny, now that the end of the cold war has unleashed an epidemic of regional conflicts and the world is groping for some institution that might tend to them. But partly it stems from Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s ambitious vision of the U.N.&#x2019;s potential. &#x201C;Never before in its history has the United Nations been so action-oriented, so actively engaged and so widely expected to respond to needs both immediate and pervasive,&#x201D; he wrote in a 1992 report. &#x201C;Clearly, it is in our power to bring about a renaissance &#x2014; to create a new United Nations for a new international era.&#x201D;\nSince that report, Cambodia has negotiated a mine field of an election under United Nations auspices with encouraging success, despite a violent boycott by the Khmer Rouge. But during the same period, horrific civil wars have erupted that defy all U.N. peacekeeping efforts.\nIn Angola, elections for a new Government failed to prevent a return to the worst fighting of its long civil war. In Bosnia, proponents of &#x201C;ethnic cleansing&#x201D; have maimed, raped and killed at will. And in Somalia, a highly publicized peacekeeping operation widely viewed as Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s pet project has claimed the lives of 30 American soldiers and 91 U.N. forces &#x2014; the most casualties since 195 peacekeepers were killed in the Congo in the 60&#x2019;s &#x2014; not to mention hundreds of Somali civilians.\nFairly or not, when an institution comes under a cloud, the lightning strikes the man perched on top.\nThe Secretary General should not have taken a prominent role in the Somali conflict to begin with, some critics contend. As Egypt&#x2019;s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs between 1977 and 1991, he had extensive dealings with Mohammed Siad Barre, the dictator whom Aidid helped overthrow. No one is calling for Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s removal, but some United Nations watchers are saying, off the record, that they are glad he intends to serve only one five-year term.\nWith his performance and even his character under fire, on this bright Sunday afternoon in Maputo Boutros-Ghali probably feels in need of a tangible victory. By now he has reached the singing groups. One by one they spring to life, clapping and dancing. Boutros-Ghali and his small entourage step off the end of the carpet, fold themselves into black Volvos and Mercedeses and speed away.\nEveryone I have spoken to in Maputo has discounted the possibility of future ethnic clashes in Mozambique. I am not an expert on the country, but I know that the Government leaders are mainly from a southern people called Shangaan and their military men are Makonde from the north, while much of the Renamo leadership derives from the Ndau people in between. I also know that President Banda of Malawi, some of whose people belong to the same tribes as those across the border, has fished for a while in northern Mozambique, hoping to pry loose a huge province with the newly minted name of Rombezia. Perhaps I think this is important because I have spent a lot of time in Yugoslavia, and I remember my first visit in 1989, when every Yugoslav told me the country&#x2019;s nationalist problem was a thing of the past.\nIn Maputo, the negotiations that the Secretary General is to help nudge along concern the 1994 elections. I have become wary of multiparty elections in countries with little national awareness &#x2014; and Mozambique has less than Yugoslavia did. Often, they turn into clarion calls for nations or tribes to coalesce around their parties and fight an electoral battle that is merely a dress rehearsal for the kind with guns.\nROMBEZIA. THE WORD IS A portmanteau of Rovuma and Zambezi, the two rivers that would define the northern and southern borders of the Malawian President&#x2019;s new province. I suppose the people living there would be encouraged to think of themselves as Rombezians.\nAbkhazians are trying to break away from Georgia and Ossetians are hoping to follow. Burundi has no Burundians, only Hutus and Tutsis, who remind the world of this by slaughtering each other by the tens of thousands. Now that we know about Tajiks, it&#x2019;s time to learn that there are Tajiks called Garmis and the non-Garmi Tajiks are killing them. If South Africa breaks up, are we going to have to start talking about Bophuthatswanans?\nOnce, in Bosnia, in a hill town of Serbs and Muslims, I met a man running a sweet shop who I thought was Albanian because he told me he was from Kosovo. But no, he was a Goranac. His people lived on a mountain ridge in the south of Kosovo and spoke their own language, which was not officially recognized because Macedonian hegemonists said it was a dialect of Macedonian. Meanwhile, Bulgarians insist that Macedonian is only a dialect of Bulgarian. The proud Goranac showed me his country on a map. It comprised eight villages.\nWelcome to . . . the New World Order? Please. It was bad enough that the phrase seems like a warmed-over Nazi locution and it has grown more offensively inappropriate with each new civil war, each new horde of starving refugees, each new failure of the international community to acknowledge reality. Even Boutros-Ghali uses the phrase on occasion, although he should know better, as he runs around the globe trying to stamp out the fires that rekindle behind him like trick birthday candles.\nThe United Nations used to have a mechanism for handling the intractable conflicts that were dumped on it. It was called &#x201C;peacekeeping&#x201D; and sometimes it worked. It was based on a few simple rules: peacekeeping forces were not introduced unless there was a peace to keep and unless all the parties to the conflict consented to their presence. They were to maintain strict neutrality and they were never to use force, except in self-defense.\nUnfortunately, the classic approach is no longer viable. At the beginning of 1992, there were 11,500 U.N. peacekeepers worldwide; today there are 72,000. The classic approach was an improvisation of the cold war. When there was a Soviet Union, the Security Council could rarely agree on U.N. involvement in a conflict, since the Soviet Union and the United States inevitably saw almost any regional crisis as one impinging on their vital interests.\nFor decades, everyone said that if only the cold war ever came to an end, the Security Council could begin to function properly. Well, here we are, and the Security Council is meeting every day and often twice a day, instead of once a month. It now agrees on the tougher issues, so forces can be sent where the bullets are still flying and where some of the parties don&#x2019;t want them. This is the kind of engagement the charter foresaw, under its chapter dealing with threats to international peace and security. But the charter also foresaw a U.N. army and a U.N. command, neither of which ever came into existence. Member states simply do not want a U.N. army. Boutros-Ghali raised the idea of one &#x2014; or, at least, designated standby forces in the various national armies &#x2014; in his 1992 Agenda for Peace and was greeted with a mixture of inaction and alarm.\nBrian Urquhart questions the usefulness of the Security Council&#x2019;s unanimity. &#x201C;I think that what has happened in the past year or two is partly because the Security Council can easily agree on almost everything. That I think is a major change and not necessarily a change for the better. The Security Council now in the most facile way can agree on resolutions and consensuses and chairman&#x2019;s statements about virtually any subject in the book. And then the various ambassadors will come out and look the cameras in the eye and say, We have decided so and so. This tends to be Wizard of Oz stuff. There are 28 resolutions now on Bosnia. Well, you would certainly never know it, if you wandered around Sarajevo.&#x201D;\nBOUTROS-GHALI campaigned hard to be the sixth Secretary General of the United Nations. The first U.N. chief, Trygve Lie, dubbed his post &#x201C;the most impossible job in the world.&#x201D; It may be that, although Boutros-Ghali and his predecessor, Javier Perez de Cuellar, insist that it is not. However, it is surely one of the most ill-defined: a combination of chief administrative officer of the United Nations and global diplomat with a fat portfolio whose pages are blank. When I ask Boutros-Ghali why he wanted the job, he replies: &#x201C;I believe that I came at a very interesting period. I would not have been interested to obtain this job five years ago.&#x201D; During his term, he says, he wants to turn the world body into &#x201C;a new instrument in the public opinion, a new instrument for the member states.&#x201D;\nNo one doubts Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s intelligence or the breadth and depth of his knowledge of political affairs. It is probably broader and deeper than that of any Secretary General before him. Born in 1922 into a wealthy Coptic family of Cairo, he has degrees in law, economics and political science at the Universities of Cairo and Paris. He taught international law at Cairo University for 30 years and wrote 31 books on international law and political science. His grandfather was Boutros Ghali, modern Egypt&#x2019;s only Christian Prime Minister, who was killed by a Muslim assassin in 1910 (to honor him, the family adopted his entire name). In 1977, Boutros Boutros-Ghali was appointed Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, just in time for the upheaval caused by Anwar Sadat&#x2019;s visit to Jerusalem, and he was instrumental in negotiating both the Camp David peace accords in 1978 and the Israel-Egypt peace treaty in 1979.\nBut soon after he arrived at the Secretariat, in January 1992, the murmurings began: about arrogance, a high-handed manner, a certain unhelpful volatility. His snappish comment to the people of Sarajevo during his visit there a year ago &#x2014; to the effect that he could name 10 places in the world that were worse off &#x2014; is still referred to with shocked awe. When a dust-up with the Security Council, and with Britain in particular, caused Fleet Street to go after him with its usual cheekiness, he blew the quarrel sky high by saying, &#x201C;Maybe because I&#x2019;m a wog.&#x201D;\nYou would think reporters would love him for saying things like that, the way they loved Ed Koch. But I find the atmosphere in the press section of the United Nations headquarters in New York to be positively poisonous. The reporters there call him Boo Boo and Peter Peter. (Boutros is Coptic for Peter.) Some surmise that, coming as he does from Egypt, Boutros-Ghali is not accustomed to a critical press.\nIn private, Boutros-Ghali can be quite charming. People who have seen him only in public find this hard to believe. He is not a good public speaker. He keeps his eyes rooted to the text in front of him. He lumbers along in heavily stressed cadences, his head bobbing and his finger jabbing, so that he seems to be hectoring his audience. The effect is even worse in news conferences. He tends to answer questions with a Gallic expression of raised eyebrows and drawn-down mouth, which in French just looks French, while in English it looks like a suppressed sneer.\nIn any event, in January 1992 Boutros-Ghali had a tough act to follow. He assumed the Secretary Generalship at a time of unprecedented euphoria over the United Nations. During the last few years of Perez de Cuellar&#x2019;s tenure, says Edward Luck, president of the United Nations Association of the U.S.A., &#x201C;there was a series of successes: Afghanistan, Iran-Iraq, Namibia, Nicaragua, the accords in El Salvador. The U.N. just seemed to have one thing after another going its way. People went from thinking the U.N. could do nothing to thinking it could do everything.&#x201D; In 1988, United Nations peacekeepers won the Nobel Peace Prize.\nThis euphoria coalesced around Perez de Cuellar, a veteran United Nations diplomat from Peru who is often described as the opposite of Boutros-Ghali &#x2014; smooth, soothing and self-effacing or, as Assistant Secretary General Alvaro de Soto calls him, &#x201C;a diplomat from the embryo.&#x201D; Perez de Cuellar also has a useful mumble that allows him to trail off into unintelligibility whenever he gets to the tricky heart of a matter, so that his listeners can interpret his remarks to their several satisfactions. He was the unsung, unassuming man from South America who rose to the historical occasion and became a dragon slayer with a disarming dullness.\nBoutros-Ghali himself tends to discount the importance of the personality of the Secretary General. &#x201C;Very often people like to compare, &#x2018;Ah, you are more active than Perez de Cuellar or than Waldheim.&#x2019; I say: &#x2018;No, let us speak very justly. If I would have been of the period of Waldheim or the period of Perez de Cuellar, I would have done exactly the same. And if Waldheim would have been now at my period, he would have been compelled, even if he did not want to do it, to be more active. So, very often it is the period that creates the man.&#x201D;\nIn Paris, where he now lives, Perez de Cuellar declines to support that sentiment. In fact, he has misgivings about United Nations policy in Somalia: &#x201C;To turn the mandate into the hunting of a man &#x2014; I immediately have some doubts about the wisdom of this issue. It&#x2019;s easy to pass judgment when you&#x2019;re out of the house. But as a man who worked in the U.N. for many years, I really suffered when I learned that so many people were killed. The image of the U.N., which needs so much improvement, has suffered.&#x201D;\nStill, Perez de Cuellar shows a clear sympathy for the difficulties Boutros-Ghali is in. When I ask if he is glad not to be Secretary General today, he answers before I even finish the sentence: &#x201C;Oh yes, oh yes. I am not a masochist.&#x201D;\nBEFORE BOUTROS-GHALI&#x2019;S arrival in Maputo, I went to see his special representative, Aldo Ajello, in his office in the headquarters for Onumoz, a French acronym for United Nations Operation in Mozambique. U.N. operation acronyms sound like brand names for cold remedies (Unifil, Untac) or creatures fighting Godzilla (Unrwa, Onumoz).\nAjello clearly enjoys his job and has an impressive grasp of those details of negotiations in which, as people say, the devil lies. On a table in his office was a computer printout of a magnificent multitiered time line in which all the interlocking institutional and logistical developments necessary for national elections in Mozambique were represented by boxes and arrows in three different colors. Everything dovetailed prettily: the setting up of commissions and assembly points, the arrival of troops for demobilization, the selection and training of 30,000 men for the new unified army, the resettling of civilians with hoes and clothes and packets of seeds.\nThe problem was, none of it was actually happening. The General Peace Accord signed in Rome in 1992 had called for elections no later than Oct. 15, 1993, which happened to be the day I was sitting in Ajello&#x2019;s office, admiring his time line. The time line itself called for elections a year hence. Ajello insisted to me that this was still possible, but a lot of people were privately saying June 1995.\nMost observers principally blamed Renamo for the delay. They were soldiers, people liked to say, not politicians. They had no idea how to negotiate or compromise, which inevitably made one wonder if they had any idea how to campaign or govern. The Renamo leader, Afonso Dhlakama, is intelligent but deeply unworldly. Later, in New York, Boutros-Ghali tells me that part of his bargaining strength with Dhlakama came from this unworldliness, from the fact that Dhlakama was so thrilled &#x201C;the Secretary General of the United Nations spent one hour with him and had a tete-a-tete with him.&#x201D;\nOne of Dhlakama&#x2019;s early demands in the negotiations had been for $100 million to transform his guerrilla army into a political party. The United Nations had responded with a trust fund of $5.8 million for that purpose. Dhlakama said he needed some of that money for &#x201C;political consultants,&#x201D; because the Renamo leadership needed to be guided through the democratic process, but U.N. rules wouldn&#x2019;t allow payments to consultants.\nSince one of the main obstacles in the negotiations involved the timing for demobilizing the soldiers and guerrillas, Dhlakama had recently been floating the idea that perhaps they could hold the elections first and demobilize afterward. Ajello&#x2019;s response to that was brief: &#x201C;No way!&#x201D;\nOnumoz had only to consider the horrifying example of Angola, where elections had been held without demobilization. When Jonas Savimbi lost, he simply went back to war. The United Nations is sometimes blamed for this failure, but the election accord was worked out without input from the U.N.\nHolding an election in a country that has never had one, especially after 16 years of war, as is the case in Mozambique, is a delicate and complex process. Since neither side trusts the other, the composition of the electoral commission is both crucial and inevitably problematic. This, indeed, has been a major stumbling block. There are other questions. If demobilization does occur, how will a devastated economy absorb a large officers corps accustomed to a bourgeois life style? How do you prepare a largely illiterate population for national elections when many people can&#x2019;t name their current President &#x2014; Joaquim Chissano? How do you get them to the polls when there are hardly any roads? How can the United Nations, or anyone, possibly determine whether the two sides are really disarming?\nTo the last question, Ajello had a much more sensible answer than any that the European Community monitors in the former Yugoslavia ever gave me. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t even try,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I know very well that they will give us old and obsolete material, and they will have here and there something hidden. I don&#x2019;t care. What I do is create the political situation in which the use of those guns is not the question. So that they stay where they are.&#x201D;\nEven assuming you successfully reach the big day, there remains the question of whether a multiparty election is always a wise prescription in the first place. I suggested this to Ajello and he concurred: &#x201C;You get out from 16 years of war. Then you finally sign a peace agreement. What do you need? You need the highest level of national unity, of national reconciliation. What do we give them? An election, which is another conflict.&#x201D;\nAjello conceded that it might have been better for Mozambique to try five years of a government of national unity before any elections. But this was not the option chosen in the Rome accord. There, too, the U.N. was only an observer.\nAmericans tend to equate elections with democracy and their observers go home trumpeting a success as soon as the votes are counted. But elections can be meaningless if a country has no tradition of a legal opposition, or an independent judiciary, or a free press. Renamo, however, Ajello said, &#x201C;is not like Savimbi. Savimbi never considered the possibility of losing the elections. These people, they understand they could lose the election, and that&#x2019;s why they want to make sure that, No. 1, they will survive this election, and No. 2, that there will be another election, after a certain time, in which they can run again.&#x201D;\nONCE BOUTROS-GHALI arrives in Maputo, negotiations shift into high gear. Waiting to talk to him, I wander around Maputo. Under the flowering jacaranda trees, girls are pounding maize in wooden hollows and other children are playing with cars &#x2014; constructed ingeniously out of wire cages &#x2014; that rattle along on aluminum-can wheels. The pastel villas of this former Portuguese colony are crumbling. The cement high-rises are crumbling. Everywhere is the sweet, dizzy stench of garbage piled high in the hot sun.\nEven if the negotiations are going nowhere, Mozambique has at least enjoyed a year of peace, and the 6,000 Onumoz peacekeepers from Bangladesh, Brazil, Botswana, Italy, Japan, Uruguay and Zambia patrolling the roads and supply corridors can take part of the credit. Only part, because it has taken several months to get the troops in place, and during those months the peace held anyway.\nThe discipline Renamo&#x2019;s guerrillas have shown in holding to the peace accord has surprised everyone. People now routinely say they are far more disciplined than the Government troops. The suburbs of Maputo are no longer being raided and the Central Hospital has far fewer recent amputees. It still has some, because more than a million mines were strewn throughout Mozambique and dislocated people returning home have been stepping on them.\nAmong Onumoz personnel there are two theories about this year of astonishing peace. The first is that it is a solid achievement in itself, because it is getting Mozambicans accustomed to peace. Even if the negotiations go nowhere, people will be less likely to return to war. The second theory is that it is a problem in disguise, because it removes any need for the parties to negotiate seriously. Meanwhile, Onumoz is costing the United Nations about $850,000 a day.\nOn the last day of his visit, Boutros-Ghali calls a news conference and announces a breakthrough. President Chissano and Dhlakama have agreed on the composition of the electoral commission. They have also agreed to maintain continuous direct negotiations in Maputo until a date for the beginning of demobilization is agreed on.\nAfter the news conference, Boutros-Ghali boards a plane for Nairobi. On the plane, he looks tired. &#x201C;I believe that I&#x2019;ve provoked a kind of awareness of the possibility that the United Nations will not participate seriously in the operation in the case that they continue to create mutual difficulties,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;The stick is, Look, there is a competition all over the world. We are trying to obtain money now for Gaza and West Bank. We are trying to obtain money for Yugoslavia. And because there is no progress, you will be completely marginalized.&#x201D;\nYes, he is pleased, but he is also perfectly aware that the whole thing can fall apart tomorrow. Or it can make great strides for three months and then suddenly collapse. Or the Mozambicans might have their election and then go back to war. Recalling the Egyptian-Israeli negotiations of 1978, he says: &#x201C;I learned the Sisyphus myth, that you have to work, work, work, and you can return to square zero, and you must have the patience, the courage to begin again. This is essential. Otherwise you are not a good negotiator. Never give up!&#x201D;\nIT IS ON THIS AFRICAN TRIP that I begin to get my own sense of Boutros-Ghali.\nHe gives an impression of nervousness in interviews. He fidgets with pieces of paper, folding and unfolding them dozens of times. On the plane, a narrow crevice between his fold-down table and the wall often proves irresistible. While explaining to me some element of policy, he will be intently trying to jam a paper into that crack. It crosses my mind that his famous aloofness may spring from shyness. Another factor may be his imperfect English. He occasionally gets lost in the thicket of a sentence and has to hack his way out. &#x201C;He gets frustrated in English and tends to raise his voice,&#x201D; says Rolf Knuttson, a member of his office. &#x201C;It makes him seem angry, when he&#x2019;s not. He never raises his voice in French.&#x201D;\nHe has the deep intellectual pride of a man who spent decades studying and teaching in the bosom of a European culture that views intellectuals as a distinct and honored class. Once he feels he knows a subject, his confidence in his opinions seems unshakable. And he is particularly proud of his knowledge of Africa.\n&#x201C;The origin is one very personal emotion,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;My grandfather signed the famous agreement of 1899, creating the condominium, the Anglo-Egyptian-Sudan. And when I was a small kid, the kids were saying, &#x2018;Your grandfather has sold the Sudan to the British!&#x2019; For me, what did &#x2018;Sudan&#x2019; mean? O.K., you can sell a car, but to sell a country? So when I was a student, there was an excursion to Khartoum in 1942, 1943 and I asked to participate. That was my first contact.\n&#x201C;In Paris, I chose the studies on colonial law. Later, I published many essays on African problems, and even created a sub-department on African affairs. I followed with great attention the creation of the Organization of African Unity. I wrote many books in English, French and Arabic on this organization. I created the African Society for Political Science. I created the African Society for Political Law. And when I was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs in November &#x2019;77, in spite of the huge crisis of the Middle East, which was the visit of Sadat, I always find time to pay attention to Africa. At the time I was accused, the media was saying, &#x2018;Because Egypt has been excluded from the Arab world, she is trying to find another backyard, and Boutros-Ghali is paying attention to Africa.&#x2019; So when I come to Africa, I know the leaders, I know the background, I know the mentality and I am at ease with them.&#x201D;\nBoutros-Ghali&#x2019;s relentlessly formal view of the United Nations and his role in it is problematic. This Cartesian approach can result in inflexibility. For example, he will defend some action he has taken not on moral or practical grounds but on the grounds that he was given a mandate by the Security Council, and a decision by the Security Council represents &#x201C;the will of the international community.&#x201D; Therefore, he is executing the will of the international community. Q.E.D. There is, as well, a certain contradiction between his two views of himself: as the impersonal executor of the Security Council&#x2019;s will and as a forward-looking agent of change.\nYou rarely forget, in talking to him, that he was a professor for 30 years. He pursues questions down the various possible logical pathways and rarely agrees with what you say, not necessarily because he believes you are wrong but because the argument, like a mountain, is there and he must climb it.\nMadeleine Albright, the United States representative at the United Nations, calls this his &#x201C;dialectical&#x201D; streak and she doesn&#x2019;t seem to appreciate it much. His famous &#x201C;wog&#x201D; comment is probably attributable to this tendency. He tells me he did not personally believe his ethnicity was an element in the British press&#x2019;s treatment of him. But he does not regret the comment because he said &#x201C;maybe,&#x201D; and you cannot rule out the possibility, since surely I would agree there is such a thing as national prejudices.\nIn short, he is an academic, not a diplomat. In fact, he tends to look on the word &#x201C;diplomat&#x201D; as pejorative. &#x201C;If you stick to principles,&#x201D; he tells me, &#x201C;you are not a diplomat&#x201D; &#x2014; a startling comment from the world&#x2019;s top diplomat.\nA PHENOMENON OF THE post-cold-war world, says Shashi Tharoor, a United Nations peacekeeping official, is &#x201C;a new transcendence&#x201D; of the global news media. &#x201C;The media now shows us a situation in a manner that clamors for international response. So as the world says: &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t just stand there. Do something!&#x2019; the Council is obliged to consider what it can do. In the cases of the former Yugoslavia and Somalia, it has used the one available institution that has existed, has worked &#x2014; peacekeeping. But this has meant sending peacekeepers where there was no peace to keep. It&#x2019;s particularly ironic that peacekeeping has been taken and put into this &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t just stand there. Do something&#x2019; syndrome, because peacekeeping has often worked best when it&#x2019;s &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t do something. Just stand there!&#x2019; &#x201C;\nIn October, television and magazines drilled home the image of a man dancing in front of the burning wreckage of a helicopter on a street in Mogadishu. He was holding a twig, at the end of which dangled a twisted lump &#x2014; a torn scrap of an American soldier&#x2019;s uniform. The ghastly thin dancing man looked like Death and the sinewy scrap of uniform he was dangling before his laughing, gaping mouth might have been roasted flesh. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t just stand there. Do something!&#x201D; became &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t just stand there. Run!&#x201D; Washington was in full scramble. Congress was threatening to force Clinton to withdraw the troops immediately.\nOn Oct. 22, Boutros-Ghali flies to Mogadishu to show support, he says, for the staff in the field. Returning to Nairobi the same afternoon, he gives a news conference. A reporter asks him whether the United Nations is still trying to capture Aidid and he gives his stock answer. He has a mandate and his job as Secretary General is to implement the mandate.\nOn the flight out of Nairobi to Addis Ababa, Boutros-Ghali tells me that Aidid has captured all the attention because he is &#x201C;Zorro against Superman, David against Goliath. The press talked to Aidid and took photos of Aidid, but not a word was given to Ali Mahdi&#x201D; &#x2014; Aidid&#x2019;s rival. &#x201C;We said to Ali Mahdi, &#x2018;Why don&#x2019;t you talk?&#x2019; and he said, &#x2018;I give four interviews to CNN but they never produced them.&#x2019; So the image very often doesn&#x2019;t correspond to the reality.&#x201D;\nThe following day, after he has seen the news reports on his own visit, he has more to say. &#x201C;It was exaggerated, what was said everywhere. In Mogadishu, I have my report, because I have a whole team of Egyptians there and they would not lie. It was 200 small kids, making a manifestation. It was just less than 200 small kids who received money and burned a few tires in the middle of the road. And they make out of it a big fuss.&#x201D;\nLike most public figures, Boutros-Ghali is sensitive to bad press and, like most of them, he insists it doesn&#x2019;t bother him. He says it is an inevitable consequence of negotiating. &#x201C;Once you are involved in any kind of mediation, you must accept in advance that you will be accused of partiality. . . . This is the rule of the game &#x2014; that you have been created to serve as a scapegoat. In the case you are successful, you must disappear, to let the other people say, &#x2018;We have done this on our own.&#x2019; And in the case you fail you must accept that you will be accused of all the failures.&#x201D;\nThis is perfectly true, and yet it can be carried too far. If you are too aware that you will always be criticized no matter what you do, how do you recognize those times when you are being criticized fairly? I am never reassured that Boutros-Ghali acknowledges there are such times.\nAidid&#x2019;s dislike of Boutros-Ghali is well known. People at the United Nations say that when the American-led forces were in charge in Mogadishu from December 1992 through April 1993, The United States special envoy, Robert Oakley, was under strict orders from Washington not to incur any American casualties. So he was careful to stay on good terms with Aidid, the warlord who controlled the port and the area around the American headquarters. But, some American diplomats say, Boutros-Ghali entertained a grand vision of the U.N. rebuilding Somalia as a nation.\nHe kept calling on the Americans to disarm the clans. They declined (no casualties, remember) and handed the operation over to the much weaker United Nations forces, which had a Security Council mandate to oversee a March 1993 accord reached in Addis Ababa that dictated disarmament. The U.N. command made it clear they expected disarming to go forward and they also began to set up district councils that were supposed to be the fundaments of a new political structure. Naturally, because Aidid wanted to be the next dictator of Somalia, he felt threatened by this and started attacking U.N. forces.\nBoutros-Ghali seems not to have realized that his background would also be a major problem in Somalia. &#x201C;I think he made a bad mistake in not saying that because of his background and experience and the part of the world he&#x2019;s from, he should step away from Somalia,&#x201D; says a long-time observer of the United Nations who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. He cites a U.N. tradition of not putting peacekeepers or negotiators in a situation where there would be conflicting national interests. &#x201C;You had Perez de Cuellar and Giandomenico Picco running between Iran and Iraq. Well, that&#x2019;s not a bad combination &#x2014; Peru and Italy. If you&#x2019;ve run foreign affairs in Egypt, if you have strong opinions about the Horn of Africa, you should step away.&#x201D;\nInstead, when the first U.N. envoy to Somalia, the Algerian diplomat Mohamed Sahnoun, differed with his boss publicly on U.N. peacekeeping policy, he was unceremoniously ousted. And rather than staying in the background, Boutros-Ghali has gone to Somalia not once but twice.\nWhen he arrives at an African country, Boutros-Ghali likes to open his public comments with a reference to his long association, as Egypt&#x2019;s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, with the country and its leaders and how pleased he is to be visiting now as Secretary General. In the case of Somalia, the warning bells should have been clanging. But this problem hits Boutros Ghali right in his blind spot: he is the African expert. Being an intellectual, and not a diplomat, he finds the suggestion that he might know more than is good for his job absurd.\nNonetheless, everyone I speak with, both inside and outside the United Nations, agrees that the Clinton Administration and Congress have unfairly and rather shamelessly scapegoated Boutros-Ghali when they pinned the blame on him and his representative, Adm. Jonathan Howe, for the heavy-handed manhunt for Aidid that led to the Oct. 3 disaster in Mogadishu.\n&#x201C;The Oct. 3 operation was totally an American operation,&#x201D; says Edward Luck, of the United Nations Association of the U.S.A. &#x201C;I mean, not even the U.N. commanders knew anything about it. Howe apparently learned about it at the very last moment. There was no effort to coordinate it with the U.N.&#x201D; He remembers Senator Alfonse D&#x2019;Amato of New York getting up on the Senate floor and saying something like: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s those U.N. dummies. We can&#x2019;t put our forces under U.N. dummies. Look what they do.&#x201D; Well, says Luck, &#x201C;those U.N. dummies happen to be Americans. The Rangers are very aggressive guys and they go off and do the things that are dangerous and high risk.&#x201D;\nAsked about Washington&#x2019;s treatment of him, Boutros-Ghali is determinedly low-keyed. &#x201C;I have to take into consideration the contradictions of the member states. This is my job. You know when you are beginning to work in a shop, the customer is always right. You are selling a suit and I don&#x2019;t like it. You will not say, &#x2018;No, but the suit is good!&#x2019; No, no! You will say&#x201D; &#x2014; here he makes a gesture of submission and infinite patience, the bright minion endeavoring to calm his dim lord &#x2014; &#x201C;Yes, sir! We will change it if you want.&#x201D;\nThe Americans, he admits, &#x201C;complicate my job. The only consolation is that they are not the only ones who complicate my job. In August, it was the Italians. You see, if you don&#x2019;t have a philosophical attitude, you will not be able to do this kind of job.&#x201D;\nHelping him turn the other cheek was a formulation one might call the Useful Scapegoat Principle. &#x201C;The U.N. was created for whom? To help the member states. If member states are in difficulties and they can just put the blame on the U.N., in a certain way you are helping. I can give you an example related to my country. One year after the creation of the U.N., the Government of Prime Minister Noukrachi wanted the abolition of the treaty which was concluded between Egypt and Great Britain. Great Britain was not ready at all. It had other things to do in 1946 than pay attention to a treaty that was concluded in Egypt. The Government was in a very difficult position. Noukrachi decided to go to the U.N. And the Security Council adopted a resolution saying the two parties had to talk directly to each other, which means nothing. He returned to Egypt and it was considered the biggest victory. The fact that we were able to complain against Great Britain to the U.N. and that the delegate of Egypt was insulting the delegate of Great Britain in the Security Council, in New York, was a great victory. In other words, if the U.N. helps to diffuse the tension existing between two countries &#x2014; why not?&#x201D;\nIN NEW YORK, THE SECURITY Council seems locked perpetually in session, and on the 38th floor of the Secretariat Boutros-Ghali keeps a busy schedule of consultations with ambassadors, envoys and heads of state. Often, he doesn&#x2019;t return to his official residence until 8 or 9 P.M. and frequently goes to his office for more work on Saturdays.\nMeanwhile, in the austere halls outside the delegates&#x2019; lounge and the Security Council chambers, the agonies of the former Yugoslavia are a heavy, intermittent presence. Now and then, the President of Bosnia, Alija Izetbegovic, comes through New York and consults with the Security Council. Each time, he seems to be retreating further into an irreal world of principle. And each time he looks older and more tired.\nThe Croats threatened in September that they would not renew the mandate for the United Nations forces arrayed between them and the Serbs of Krajina, a region in Croatia, because the U.N. was not disarming the Serbs or helping restore Croatian authority in Serb-held areas. But then they allow themselves to be talked out of it, because if the forces left they would have to start fighting the Croatian Serbs again, at a time when they are getting along well with the Bosnian Serbs in their joint project of carving up Bosnia.\nThe Serbs representing the new Yugoslavia wander like ghosts through the halls and hang around the delegates&#x2019; lounge, because they have been denied the old Yugoslavia seat in the General Assembly pending a formal reapplication. They have failed to submit one, telling anyone who will listen that they have no control over the Bosnian Serbs or the Croatian Serbs.\nThe United Nations has gotten pushed and pulled into Yugoslavia by the familiar forces of a public demanding action and governments&#x2019; efforts to satisfy these demands by resolutions in the Security Council. Initially baby steps down the slippery slope, these resolutions have degenerated into empty promises of intervention. Kofi Annan, Under Secretary General for Peacekeeping Operations, has a flexible and sensible attitude about this problem. In describing the difficulties of peacekeeping in Bosnia, he stresses that Security Council resolutions more often than not get in the way. They tend to polarize the sides, as one group or another becomes obsessed with the perceived unfairness of a certain resolution. &#x201C;Forget the resolutions,&#x201D; Annan tells them. &#x201C;We know where we want to go. Let&#x2019;s figure out how to get there.&#x201D;\nBoutros-Ghali&#x2019;s reluctance to get the U.N. involved in Bosnia is well known. He is often quoted as having said that Bosnia was a &#x201C;rich man&#x2019;s war,&#x201D; but he insists he was misunderstood. He was, he says, referring to the amount of attention Bosnia was getting compared with other areas of conflict. He argues that since the European Community was already involved in the former Yugoslavia, he saw dangers in bringing in the United Nations because the parties to the conflict would then be able to play one organization off against the other.\nThe United Nations Charter directs it to rely on regional organizations when possible. Since the European Community is one of the richest regional organizations in the world, it might make sense for the community to deal with Yugoslavia and free U.N. funds for operations in areas where such groups are poor. The European Community, however, has declared itself incapable of acting without the U.N. umbrella.\nThen there is Haiti.\nIn early October, some Haitians yelled on the dock of Port-au-Prince that they would turn Haiti into another Somalia. They sent an American ship, the Harlan County, with 200 American and Canadian engineers and advisers packing. After the Harlan County left, the U.N. withdrew its observers from Haiti, the Security Council reimposed trade sanctions and the debate turned to how many Haitian children were dying each month as a result of the embargo.\nSome editorialists scoffed at the United States and the United Nations running from a few &#x201C;thugs.&#x201D; But haven&#x2019;t we been assured before that an operation, like the manhunt for Aidid, is only a matter of cowing a few &#x201C;thugs&#x201D;? Why are thugs easier to fight than soldiers? One can argue that thugs are harder to fight. Since they are not answerable to anyone, you can&#x2019;t pressure them politically. You can only try to find them and kill them, and in doing so you kill a lot of bystanders. The thugs, not being stupid, help you do this. You begin to lose support among the very people you set out to help, who start to look on the thugs as their defenders. And there you are, talking about your &#x201C;credibility,&#x201D; hip-deep in the muck and morally lost.\nThe withdrawal of the U.N. forces from Haiti, Boutros-Ghali tells me, was necessitated by Washington&#x2019;s decision not to dock the Harlan County. He shrugs and says: &#x201C;I return to my old theory. If the member states do not want to implement a resolution, we can do nothing.&#x201D;\nIF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO TALK about fulfilling the potential of the United Nations Charter, they ought to recognize that the charter was written by war-making countries. These were countries accustomed to the deliberate firebombing of major cities, whose millions of soldiers occupied Europe, North Africa and much of Asia. The Churchillian words of article 42 came easily to them: the Security Council &#x201C;may take such action by air, sea or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.&#x201D;\nThe framers of the charter were victors, with a clear and unembarrassed conviction that they had the right to dictate to other people what was good for them. One of the U.N.&#x2019;s first major acts &#x2014; a model of cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States &#x2014; had nothing to do with repelling aggression against one of its members or relieving a humanitarian crisis. It was the partition of Palestine, against the repeated protests of the Arab countries, member states all.\nNow, 45 years later, the Security Council has reactivated article 42, and the world seems to be surprised that it is a war-making mechanism. In April, the Secretary General established a Situation Center to keep tabs on the many peacekeeping missions around the world (see map on page 22). Temporarily set up in a building across the street from the Secretariat, the Situation Center itself is a large windowless room with desks and computer monitors. The military personnel from member nations are on 24-hour duty and are paid for by their own countries.\nThe problem these days when man-made disasters strike with increasing frequency is that not only do Americans have no apparent desire to fight wars for the sake of security in the Horn of Africa or humanitarianism in general, but they are no longer convinced of the inherent rightness of any project they undertake. And Americans are not the only ones who think this way.\nHowever, if the 184 members of the United Nations are serious about their world organization, they need to decide under what circumstances and in pursuit of what goals they are willing to suffer casualties. They need to acknowledge to their citizens that if they participate in U.N. peacekeeping or &#x201C;peace-enforcing&#x201D; operations, they will suffer casualties. They have to define what sorts of things affect their national security in that circle beyond the innermost one of direct attack and interruption of vital trade. They have to discuss what they are willing to do to protect those interests. And they have wrestle with a question raised by Margaret Thatcher in May: If Bosnia is not in our sphere of interest, should it be in our sphere of conscience?\nIn the United States, we have to invoke a more subtle range of lessons from the past than Vietnam (quagmire; do not engage) and Hitler (can&#x2019;t appease; engage). The Clinton Administration is currently trying to thrash out some of these ideas. A classified document recently making the rounds in Washington proposed that the United States support the use of force by the Security Council in cases of &#x201C;international aggression, a humanitarian disaster requiring urgent action coupled with violence, a sudden and unexpected interruption of established democracy or gross violation of human rights coupled with violence.&#x201D; If a U.N. operation is to include American troops, the document continued, more requirements must be met: most notably, American national interest must be directly affected and Congress must support the deployment.\nIn a recent speech to the Council of Foreign Relations, the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, set out to define the Administration&#x2019;s plan to replace the cold war doctrine of containment with a strategy of &#x201C;enlargement.&#x201D; It consists of four components: strengthening &#x201C;major market democracies&#x201D;; &#x201C;consolidating democracy and markets in states of special significance or opportunity&#x201D;; countering the aggression &#x201C;of states hostile to democracy and markets&#x201D; and &#x201C;pursuing humanitarian goals and limiting sectarian conflict in regions of greatest concern.&#x201D;\n&#x201C;American efforts to foster freedom must be tightly targeted and demand-driven,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;CNN is not a compass for American interests. We cannot act on the urge, rooted as it is in good intentions, to respond to every crisis.&#x201D;\nAs discussions continue on what constitutes &#x201C;national interest,&#x201D; people also need to agree on what they mean by &#x201C;the United Nations,&#x201D; since in different contexts they mean different things. When the public reads about something the Security Council has decided, it thinks &#x201C;U.N.&#x201D; But people in the Secretariat look at the decisions by the Security Council and think &#x201C;member states.&#x201D; When President Clinton said in his address to the General Assembly in September, &#x201C;If the American people are to say yes to U.N. peacekeeping, the United Nations must know when to say no,&#x201D; he was speaking to the Security Council, which authorizes those operations. But the United States is a permanent member with vetoing power in the Security Council, so the President was really talking to his own Administration.\nWhen critics charge that &#x201C;the U.N.&#x201D; takes six months to get troops into place after a peacekeeping operation is authorized, they seem to be referring to the Secretariat. But member states are slow to send their troops. The Secretariat would not have to wait for members to contribute troops if it had its own army, or designated standby units, as both the charter and Boutros-Ghali envision, but the member states refuse to authorize either of these things.\nMember states complain about the budget, but member states pass the budget. And the United States, with the largest assessment (it&#x2019;s based primarily on gross national product), can&#x2019;t complain it is outvoted by a bunch of little countries whose assessments are practically nothing because for years now the budget has been set by consensus.\nIn the case of Somalia, the confusion over &#x201C;the U.N.&#x201D; especially points up the dangers of not having worked out an agreement for American troops to serve under United Nations command. The Force Commander in Somalia, the Turkish Lieut. Gen. Cevik Bir, is United Nations. His deputy commander is Maj. Gen. Thomas Montgomery, an American. As Deputy Force Commander, Montgomery is United Nations. But as field commander of the American Quick Reaction Force, he reports to the United States Central Command in Tampa, Fla., so he is United States. Then there is Admiral Howe. He is Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s special representative, but he is also an American with extensive connections in Washington, which he used to garner support for his manhunt for Aidid. Is he United Nations or United States? The question cannot really be answered, and that is a problem. In its reluctance to put its troops under United Nations command, the United States cobbled together a compromise of confused responsibility that probably put its troops in more danger.\nAs for the Secretary General and his role, Boutros-Ghali not only carries out the Security Council&#x2019;s vague and sometimes tortured directives but he writes the reports on which the Council partly bases some of those directives. But to talk about &#x201C;Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s U.N.,&#x201D; as many do, is misleading. It is Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s Secretariat, not his U.N. And the personality traits that many complain about have more of an effect on morale in the Secretariat than they do on security in the world. His retreat over the policy in Somalia shows that it is just as much, if not more, Bill Clinton&#x2019;s U.N. &#x2014; which may explain why the U.N. seems adrift at the moment, since Bill Clinton isn&#x2019;t paying much attention.\nIn its role as guarantor of international peace and security, &#x201C;the U.N.&#x201D; is much more the Security Council than it is the Secretariat. But how coherent an entity is the Security Council? As a body with an intention and a will, does it exist any more than &#x201C;Europe&#x201D; does? The permanent five are all preoccupied with their own problems. Russia is busy rewriting its Constitution, electing its Parliament and fighting hyperinflation. President Clinton has had his hands full trying to pass his budget, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Brady Bill, a health care program. . . . China is the phantom of the Council. The three pillars of its policy seem to be negative: don&#x2019;t discuss human rights, don&#x2019;t mention Tibet and don&#x2019;t let Taiwan into the U.N. France and Britain are the most committed multilaterists. Unfortunately, they often disagree with each other. In any event, both countries have been preoccupied with serious downturns in their economy.\nThen there is the question of the Security Council&#x2019;s legitimacy as a representative of &#x201C;the international community.&#x201D; World War II was won quite a while ago. Germany and Japan both indicate that they wouldn&#x2019;t mind being permanent members, and the prospect of getting more money out of them for the cash-starved United Nations is inviting, although &#x2014; for the time being &#x2014; both are trying to pull out of their economic doldrums. But admitting them would only tilt the Council further toward the developed world.\nThere are proposals to include other powers in the Council, but who would they be and who would choose them? India seems an obvious choice, unless you happen to be from Pakistan. Nigeria is the most populous nation in Africa, but it is currently in turmoil. And do you give these new permanent members vetoes or would that hobble the Council again? These are probably insoluble political problems. The only way to come up with a more up-to-date Council might be to fight another world war and hand it once more to the victors.\nWith its haziness of outline, &#x201C;the U.N.&#x201D; becomes an irresistible target for blame when something goes wrong. Since the organization is, in a sense, everybody, it is also always somebody else. This feeds into, and off, a certain knee-jerk anti-U.N. attitude in some quarters in the United States that is a combination of simple nativism, a cultural distrust of government and a visceral hatred of bureaucracy.\nThere is a danger here. The United Nations is dependent on good will and good press. Countries are only too happy to have an excuse to withhold their assessments. And the U.N. not only has no army and no treasury, but it also has no constituency. If the end of the 20th century is teaching us anything, it is that nationalism is stronger than ever. The U.N. has no anthem to sing and although it does have a flag &#x2014; a map of the world &#x2014; at its center lies the North Pole, where no one lives.\nMY LAST MEETING WITH Boutros-Ghali is at 3 Sutton Place, the handsome Georgian manor near the East River that was built for J. P. Morgan&#x2019;s daughter and was donated to the U.N. Association in 1972 for use as the Secretary General&#x2019;s residence.\nBoutros-Ghali is at his most charming. He is more relaxed than I have yet seen him, either because it is Sunday and he is at home or because, after six meetings, he is getting used to me.\n&#x201C;The last time I saw you, in the London airport, you looked like this!&#x201D; he says delightedly, stretching stiffly back in his chair like a corpse, mouth open. (I had gotten sick in Africa, before proceeding to London.) He tells me a couple of amusing anecdotes about his negotiations for the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty and takes me on a tour of the residence.\nIn every room, there are ancient bronze birds from Egypt and Persia, which he has been collecting for years. He directs a light on them, so that I can see the intricate shadow-lines left behind by the long-vanished gold. He points out the Matisse and the Leger and the Bonnard that are on loan from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art. He waves at the Utrillo, which Leia, his wife, has picked out and which he does not like. He and his wife have a whole routine, which they seem to enjoy. He complains about her nagging or some wrongheaded decision she has made. But when she appears, a quite imposing tall blonde, he steps away, meekly draws in his head and says, &#x201C;She&#x2019;s the boss!&#x201D;\nBoutros-Ghali and I settle down for a few questions. Is the role that he frequently sees for himself as Secretary General &#x2014; that of the humble servant patiently taking knocks from an imperious master &#x2014; modeled on his experiences as a Copt in Egypt, as someone who, though wealthy and from a proud family, has had to accept that he will never quite belong?\nHe will have none of it. &#x201C;I never felt this during all the 68 years I spent of my life in Egypt. I never felt this at all, maybe because I belonged to the haute bourgeoisie. I have always had Muslim friends, Jewish friends.&#x201D; He attributes his ability to be self-effacing to the fact that he has been trained to do this kind of work.\nWhen I ask if he had difficulty adjusting to this role, for the only time in our talks he acknowledges that the humble servant occasionally blows up at the master who is not as bright.\n&#x201C;Even now, I am not good at this. The fact that I have so many troubles is that very often rather than keep quiet, I just say loudly what I think. I had trouble with the Israelis, during my negotiations with them, and I have trouble with many people, because on the contrary I am not enough trained to do this kind of thing. If you want a kind of auto-criticism.&#x201D;\nAnd is the United Nations going through a crisis of confidence right now, after the problems of the last three months?\n&#x201C;No, for me the U.N. has not changed. I am just saying that the U.S. as a major actor is passing by a crisis of less support for the U.N., period. What I am saying is, in my own interpretation, that this is tactical and not strategic. That they will return back to the U.N. and give the same support, after the crisis will get over.&#x201D;\nI bring up Mozambique. Have the negotiations continued to make progress after his departure? He is surprised by the question and brightens. &#x201C;Oh yes, yes! It is a success story! Which don&#x2019;t appear in the press! The press likes the return of Zorro!&#x201D;\nA few days later I call Aldo Ajello, Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s special representative in Maputo. He says that the Secretary General&#x2019;s visit has made great progress possible. The electoral law has been approved and 20 troop assembly areas have been opened, with the first groups of Government and Renamo fighters arriving just a few days previously, for disarmament and demobilization. Ajello thinks they might make the October 1994 deadline for elections.\n&#x201C;The fundamental decision made by Renamo since Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s visit is to give up the military option,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;The only problem now &#x2014; but it is a big problem &#x2014; is the financial problem. Renamo still wants money.&#x201D; Ajello is asking for a new trust fund of $4 million, to be set up under more flexible rules than the U.N.-administered fund they already have. &#x201C;But the money is just not coming. I am afraid to say, the international community is much more willing to fund war than peace. If this money doesn&#x2019;t come through, the whole thing will collapse.&#x201D;\nI hang up with the impresssion that Ajello and Onumoz have a tough, complicated job to do and that they seem to be tackling it as well as anyone can. And if it all fails for lack of a trust fund, who will be responsible? The United Nations-as-Secretariat, for the bureaucratic rigidity of the first trust fund for Mozambique? Or the United Nations-as-member-states, for the unwillingness to cough up a paltry $4 million for the stabilization of Mozambique?\nImpossible to answer. The only sure thing is, if Mozambique fails, fingers will be pointing, all around the circle."}, {"text": "Blue Helmets, Empty Guns\n1994-01-02T05:00:00.000Z\nOn a hazy October day, the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, steps off a chartered jet at the airport of Maputo, the capital of Mozambique. He moves patiently down the weathered red carpet, shaking hands with the assembled ambassadors and dignitaries. A phalanx of Mozambican soldiers snaps to attention and a band harrumphs through a martial tune. Beyond the ambassadors, a dozen singing groups wait their turn to perform. Mozambique, which gained its independence from Portugal in 1975, has never before been visited by a United Nations Secretary General.&#xa;\n&#xa;As I watch Boutros-Ghali, I can only wonder at his thoughts. He is stone-faced much of the time, especially in public. He walks stiffly, with his head pushed forward, which makes him look shorter than he is. He will laugh when a laugh is called for. It&#x2019;s a charming, lit-up laugh, often accompanied by a friendly grab at the arm of his interlocutor. But then he quickly folds the laugh up and returns to impassivity.\nHis agenda for this 10-day African tour is extraordinarily full &#x2014; and packed with potential catastrophes. On the way to Mozambique, he held meetings in Egypt and Djibouti to discuss regional support for a political settlement in Somalia. In Maputo, he hopes to jump-start negotiations between the Government and Renamo, an insurgency group, that have stalled for a year.\nHe is also scheduled to meet with his special representatives from South Africa, which is looking increasingly unstable, and Angola, which is a bloody nightmare. Then he is heading for Nairobi, which has had an influx of refugees from Somalia. After that, he goes on to Somalia itself, where Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid is planning to demonstrate against him and presumably, if the opportunity arises, shoot him.\nWorse, someone in the United States Government has chosen this moment to undercut him publicly. The day before his arrival in Maputo, The Washington Post reported in a front-page article: &#x201C;The Clinton Administration, increasingly unhappy with U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, is pressing him to cancel a visit to Mogadishu on the grounds that his unpopularity among Somalis could provoke demonstrations or even a breakdown in the current truce between U.N. forces and militia leader Mohammed Farah Aidid.&#x201D;\nFor the past several years, Washington has seemed increasingly plagued by leaks, but this one is particularly stinging. One wonders what its purpose is, since anyone who knows Boutros-Ghali even slightly knows it will only harden his resolve. &#x201C;It automatically puts him in an impossible situation,&#x201D; notes Sir Brian Urquhart, a 41-year veteran of the United Nations who is a scholar in residence at the Ford Foundation. &#x201C;If he doesn&#x2019;t go, people would think he&#x2019;s some kind of poodle.&#x201D;\n&#x201C;Poodle&#x201D; is not a word that would normally occur to anyone who has had dealings with Boutros-Ghali. Bull terrier, maybe. Friends of his, like Nabil Elaraby, the Egyptian Ambassador to the United Nations, call him &#x201C;independent-minded,&#x201D; &#x201C;straightforward&#x201D; and &#x201C;self-confident.&#x201D; Others offer up &#x201C;abrasive,&#x201D; &#x201C;stubborn&#x201D; and &#x201C;thin-skinned.&#x201D;\nCertainly, in his two years of office, Boutros-Ghali has become the most high-profile Secretary General since Dag Hammarskjold, who died in a plane crash in 1961. Partly, this is because the United Nations is under more scrutiny, now that the end of the cold war has unleashed an epidemic of regional conflicts and the world is groping for some institution that might tend to them. But partly it stems from Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s ambitious vision of the U.N.&#x2019;s potential. &#x201C;Never before in its history has the United Nations been so action-oriented, so actively engaged and so widely expected to respond to needs both immediate and pervasive,&#x201D; he wrote in a 1992 report. &#x201C;Clearly, it is in our power to bring about a renaissance &#x2014; to create a new United Nations for a new international era.&#x201D;\nSince that report, Cambodia has negotiated a mine field of an election under United Nations auspices with encouraging success, despite a violent boycott by the Khmer Rouge. But during the same period, horrific civil wars have erupted that defy all U.N. peacekeeping efforts.\nIn Angola, elections for a new Government failed to prevent a return to the worst fighting of its long civil war. In Bosnia, proponents of &#x201C;ethnic cleansing&#x201D; have maimed, raped and killed at will. And in Somalia, a highly publicized peacekeeping operation widely viewed as Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s pet project has claimed the lives of 30 American soldiers and 91 U.N. forces &#x2014; the most casualties since 195 peacekeepers were killed in the Congo in the 60&#x2019;s &#x2014; not to mention hundreds of Somali civilians.\nFairly or not, when an institution comes under a cloud, the lightning strikes the man perched on top.\nThe Secretary General should not have taken a prominent role in the Somali conflict to begin with, some critics contend. As Egypt&#x2019;s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs between 1977 and 1991, he had extensive dealings with Mohammed Siad Barre, the dictator whom Aidid helped overthrow. No one is calling for Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s removal, but some United Nations watchers are saying, off the record, that they are glad he intends to serve only one five-year term.\nWith his performance and even his character under fire, on this bright Sunday afternoon in Maputo Boutros-Ghali probably feels in need of a tangible victory. By now he has reached the singing groups. One by one they spring to life, clapping and dancing. Boutros-Ghali and his small entourage step off the end of the carpet, fold themselves into black Volvos and Mercedeses and speed away.\nEveryone I have spoken to in Maputo has discounted the possibility of future ethnic clashes in Mozambique. I am not an expert on the country, but I know that the Government leaders are mainly from a southern people called Shangaan and their military men are Makonde from the north, while much of the Renamo leadership derives from the Ndau people in between. I also know that President Banda of Malawi, some of whose people belong to the same tribes as those across the border, has fished for a while in northern Mozambique, hoping to pry loose a huge province with the newly minted name of Rombezia. Perhaps I think this is important because I have spent a lot of time in Yugoslavia, and I remember my first visit in 1989, when every Yugoslav told me the country&#x2019;s nationalist problem was a thing of the past.\nIn Maputo, the negotiations that the Secretary General is to help nudge along concern the 1994 elections. I have become wary of multiparty elections in countries with little national awareness &#x2014; and Mozambique has less than Yugoslavia did. Often, they turn into clarion calls for nations or tribes to coalesce around their parties and fight an electoral battle that is merely a dress rehearsal for the kind with guns.\nROMBEZIA. THE WORD IS A portmanteau of Rovuma and Zambezi, the two rivers that would define the northern and southern borders of the Malawian President&#x2019;s new province. I suppose the people living there would be encouraged to think of themselves as Rombezians.\nAbkhazians are trying to break away from Georgia and Ossetians are hoping to follow. Burundi has no Burundians, only Hutus and Tutsis, who remind the world of this by slaughtering each other by the tens of thousands. Now that we know about Tajiks, it&#x2019;s time to learn that there are Tajiks called Garmis and the non-Garmi Tajiks are killing them. If South Africa breaks up, are we going to have to start talking about Bophuthatswanans?\nOnce, in Bosnia, in a hill town of Serbs and Muslims, I met a man running a sweet shop who I thought was Albanian because he told me he was from Kosovo. But no, he was a Goranac. His people lived on a mountain ridge in the south of Kosovo and spoke their own language, which was not officially recognized because Macedonian hegemonists said it was a dialect of Macedonian. Meanwhile, Bulgarians insist that Macedonian is only a dialect of Bulgarian. The proud Goranac showed me his country on a map. It comprised eight villages.\nWelcome to . . . the New World Order? Please. It was bad enough that the phrase seems like a warmed-over Nazi locution and it has grown more offensively inappropriate with each new civil war, each new horde of starving refugees, each new failure of the international community to acknowledge reality. Even Boutros-Ghali uses the phrase on occasion, although he should know better, as he runs around the globe trying to stamp out the fires that rekindle behind him like trick birthday candles.\nThe United Nations used to have a mechanism for handling the intractable conflicts that were dumped on it. It was called &#x201C;peacekeeping&#x201D; and sometimes it worked. It was based on a few simple rules: peacekeeping forces were not introduced unless there was a peace to keep and unless all the parties to the conflict consented to their presence. They were to maintain strict neutrality and they were never to use force, except in self-defense.\nUnfortunately, the classic approach is no longer viable. At the beginning of 1992, there were 11,500 U.N. peacekeepers worldwide; today there are 72,000. The classic approach was an improvisation of the cold war. When there was a Soviet Union, the Security Council could rarely agree on U.N. involvement in a conflict, since the Soviet Union and the United States inevitably saw almost any regional crisis as one impinging on their vital interests.\nFor decades, everyone said that if only the cold war ever came to an end, the Security Council could begin to function properly. Well, here we are, and the Security Council is meeting every day and often twice a day, instead of once a month. It now agrees on the tougher issues, so forces can be sent where the bullets are still flying and where some of the parties don&#x2019;t want them. This is the kind of engagement the charter foresaw, under its chapter dealing with threats to international peace and security. But the charter also foresaw a U.N. army and a U.N. command, neither of which ever came into existence. Member states simply do not want a U.N. army. Boutros-Ghali raised the idea of one &#x2014; or, at least, designated standby forces in the various national armies &#x2014; in his 1992 Agenda for Peace and was greeted with a mixture of inaction and alarm.\nBrian Urquhart questions the usefulness of the Security Council&#x2019;s unanimity. &#x201C;I think that what has happened in the past year or two is partly because the Security Council can easily agree on almost everything. That I think is a major change and not necessarily a change for the better. The Security Council now in the most facile way can agree on resolutions and consensuses and chairman&#x2019;s statements about virtually any subject in the book. And then the various ambassadors will come out and look the cameras in the eye and say, We have decided so and so. This tends to be Wizard of Oz stuff. There are 28 resolutions now on Bosnia. Well, you would certainly never know it, if you wandered around Sarajevo.&#x201D;\nBOUTROS-GHALI campaigned hard to be the sixth Secretary General of the United Nations. The first U.N. chief, Trygve Lie, dubbed his post &#x201C;the most impossible job in the world.&#x201D; It may be that, although Boutros-Ghali and his predecessor, Javier Perez de Cuellar, insist that it is not. However, it is surely one of the most ill-defined: a combination of chief administrative officer of the United Nations and global diplomat with a fat portfolio whose pages are blank. When I ask Boutros-Ghali why he wanted the job, he replies: &#x201C;I believe that I came at a very interesting period. I would not have been interested to obtain this job five years ago.&#x201D; During his term, he says, he wants to turn the world body into &#x201C;a new instrument in the public opinion, a new instrument for the member states.&#x201D;\nNo one doubts Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s intelligence or the breadth and depth of his knowledge of political affairs. It is probably broader and deeper than that of any Secretary General before him. Born in 1922 into a wealthy Coptic family of Cairo, he has degrees in law, economics and political science at the Universities of Cairo and Paris. He taught international law at Cairo University for 30 years and wrote 31 books on international law and political science. His grandfather was Boutros Ghali, modern Egypt&#x2019;s only Christian Prime Minister, who was killed by a Muslim assassin in 1910 (to honor him, the family adopted his entire name). In 1977, Boutros Boutros-Ghali was appointed Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, just in time for the upheaval caused by Anwar Sadat&#x2019;s visit to Jerusalem, and he was instrumental in negotiating both the Camp David peace accords in 1978 and the Israel-Egypt peace treaty in 1979.\nBut soon after he arrived at the Secretariat, in January 1992, the murmurings began: about arrogance, a high-handed manner, a certain unhelpful volatility. His snappish comment to the people of Sarajevo during his visit there a year ago &#x2014; to the effect that he could name 10 places in the world that were worse off &#x2014; is still referred to with shocked awe. When a dust-up with the Security Council, and with Britain in particular, caused Fleet Street to go after him with its usual cheekiness, he blew the quarrel sky high by saying, &#x201C;Maybe because I&#x2019;m a wog.&#x201D;\nYou would think reporters would love him for saying things like that, the way they loved Ed Koch. But I find the atmosphere in the press section of the United Nations headquarters in New York to be positively poisonous. The reporters there call him Boo Boo and Peter Peter. (Boutros is Coptic for Peter.) Some surmise that, coming as he does from Egypt, Boutros-Ghali is not accustomed to a critical press.\nIn private, Boutros-Ghali can be quite charming. People who have seen him only in public find this hard to believe. He is not a good public speaker. He keeps his eyes rooted to the text in front of him. He lumbers along in heavily stressed cadences, his head bobbing and his finger jabbing, so that he seems to be hectoring his audience. The effect is even worse in news conferences. He tends to answer questions with a Gallic expression of raised eyebrows and drawn-down mouth, which in French just looks French, while in English it looks like a suppressed sneer.\nIn any event, in January 1992 Boutros-Ghali had a tough act to follow. He assumed the Secretary Generalship at a time of unprecedented euphoria over the United Nations. During the last few years of Perez de Cuellar&#x2019;s tenure, says Edward Luck, president of the United Nations Association of the U.S.A., &#x201C;there was a series of successes: Afghanistan, Iran-Iraq, Namibia, Nicaragua, the accords in El Salvador. The U.N. just seemed to have one thing after another going its way. People went from thinking the U.N. could do nothing to thinking it could do everything.&#x201D; In 1988, United Nations peacekeepers won the Nobel Peace Prize.\nThis euphoria coalesced around Perez de Cuellar, a veteran United Nations diplomat from Peru who is often described as the opposite of Boutros-Ghali &#x2014; smooth, soothing and self-effacing or, as Assistant Secretary General Alvaro de Soto calls him, &#x201C;a diplomat from the embryo.&#x201D; Perez de Cuellar also has a useful mumble that allows him to trail off into unintelligibility whenever he gets to the tricky heart of a matter, so that his listeners can interpret his remarks to their several satisfactions. He was the unsung, unassuming man from South America who rose to the historical occasion and became a dragon slayer with a disarming dullness.\nBoutros-Ghali himself tends to discount the importance of the personality of the Secretary General. &#x201C;Very often people like to compare, &#x2018;Ah, you are more active than Perez de Cuellar or than Waldheim.&#x2019; I say: &#x2018;No, let us speak very justly. If I would have been of the period of Waldheim or the period of Perez de Cuellar, I would have done exactly the same. And if Waldheim would have been now at my period, he would have been compelled, even if he did not want to do it, to be more active. So, very often it is the period that creates the man.&#x201D;\nIn Paris, where he now lives, Perez de Cuellar declines to support that sentiment. In fact, he has misgivings about United Nations policy in Somalia: &#x201C;To turn the mandate into the hunting of a man &#x2014; I immediately have some doubts about the wisdom of this issue. It&#x2019;s easy to pass judgment when you&#x2019;re out of the house. But as a man who worked in the U.N. for many years, I really suffered when I learned that so many people were killed. The image of the U.N., which needs so much improvement, has suffered.&#x201D;\nStill, Perez de Cuellar shows a clear sympathy for the difficulties Boutros-Ghali is in. When I ask if he is glad not to be Secretary General today, he answers before I even finish the sentence: &#x201C;Oh yes, oh yes. I am not a masochist.&#x201D;\nBEFORE BOUTROS-GHALI&#x2019;S arrival in Maputo, I went to see his special representative, Aldo Ajello, in his office in the headquarters for Onumoz, a French acronym for United Nations Operation in Mozambique. U.N. operation acronyms sound like brand names for cold remedies (Unifil, Untac) or creatures fighting Godzilla (Unrwa, Onumoz).\nAjello clearly enjoys his job and has an impressive grasp of those details of negotiations in which, as people say, the devil lies. On a table in his office was a computer printout of a magnificent multitiered time line in which all the interlocking institutional and logistical developments necessary for national elections in Mozambique were represented by boxes and arrows in three different colors. Everything dovetailed prettily: the setting up of commissions and assembly points, the arrival of troops for demobilization, the selection and training of 30,000 men for the new unified army, the resettling of civilians with hoes and clothes and packets of seeds.\nThe problem was, none of it was actually happening. The General Peace Accord signed in Rome in 1992 had called for elections no later than Oct. 15, 1993, which happened to be the day I was sitting in Ajello&#x2019;s office, admiring his time line. The time line itself called for elections a year hence. Ajello insisted to me that this was still possible, but a lot of people were privately saying June 1995.\nMost observers principally blamed Renamo for the delay. They were soldiers, people liked to say, not politicians. They had no idea how to negotiate or compromise, which inevitably made one wonder if they had any idea how to campaign or govern. The Renamo leader, Afonso Dhlakama, is intelligent but deeply unworldly. Later, in New York, Boutros-Ghali tells me that part of his bargaining strength with Dhlakama came from this unworldliness, from the fact that Dhlakama was so thrilled &#x201C;the Secretary General of the United Nations spent one hour with him and had a tete-a-tete with him.&#x201D;\nOne of Dhlakama&#x2019;s early demands in the negotiations had been for $100 million to transform his guerrilla army into a political party. The United Nations had responded with a trust fund of $5.8 million for that purpose. Dhlakama said he needed some of that money for &#x201C;political consultants,&#x201D; because the Renamo leadership needed to be guided through the democratic process, but U.N. rules wouldn&#x2019;t allow payments to consultants.\nSince one of the main obstacles in the negotiations involved the timing for demobilizing the soldiers and guerrillas, Dhlakama had recently been floating the idea that perhaps they could hold the elections first and demobilize afterward. Ajello&#x2019;s response to that was brief: &#x201C;No way!&#x201D;\nOnumoz had only to consider the horrifying example of Angola, where elections had been held without demobilization. When Jonas Savimbi lost, he simply went back to war. The United Nations is sometimes blamed for this failure, but the election accord was worked out without input from the U.N.\nHolding an election in a country that has never had one, especially after 16 years of war, as is the case in Mozambique, is a delicate and complex process. Since neither side trusts the other, the composition of the electoral commission is both crucial and inevitably problematic. This, indeed, has been a major stumbling block. There are other questions. If demobilization does occur, how will a devastated economy absorb a large officers corps accustomed to a bourgeois life style? How do you prepare a largely illiterate population for national elections when many people can&#x2019;t name their current President &#x2014; Joaquim Chissano? How do you get them to the polls when there are hardly any roads? How can the United Nations, or anyone, possibly determine whether the two sides are really disarming?\nTo the last question, Ajello had a much more sensible answer than any that the European Community monitors in the former Yugoslavia ever gave me. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t even try,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I know very well that they will give us old and obsolete material, and they will have here and there something hidden. I don&#x2019;t care. What I do is create the political situation in which the use of those guns is not the question. So that they stay where they are.&#x201D;\nEven assuming you successfully reach the big day, there remains the question of whether a multiparty election is always a wise prescription in the first place. I suggested this to Ajello and he concurred: &#x201C;You get out from 16 years of war. Then you finally sign a peace agreement. What do you need? You need the highest level of national unity, of national reconciliation. What do we give them? An election, which is another conflict.&#x201D;\nAjello conceded that it might have been better for Mozambique to try five years of a government of national unity before any elections. But this was not the option chosen in the Rome accord. There, too, the U.N. was only an observer.\nAmericans tend to equate elections with democracy and their observers go home trumpeting a success as soon as the votes are counted. But elections can be meaningless if a country has no tradition of a legal opposition, or an independent judiciary, or a free press. Renamo, however, Ajello said, &#x201C;is not like Savimbi. Savimbi never considered the possibility of losing the elections. These people, they understand they could lose the election, and that&#x2019;s why they want to make sure that, No. 1, they will survive this election, and No. 2, that there will be another election, after a certain time, in which they can run again.&#x201D;\nONCE BOUTROS-GHALI arrives in Maputo, negotiations shift into high gear. Waiting to talk to him, I wander around Maputo. Under the flowering jacaranda trees, girls are pounding maize in wooden hollows and other children are playing with cars &#x2014; constructed ingeniously out of wire cages &#x2014; that rattle along on aluminum-can wheels. The pastel villas of this former Portuguese colony are crumbling. The cement high-rises are crumbling. Everywhere is the sweet, dizzy stench of garbage piled high in the hot sun.\nEven if the negotiations are going nowhere, Mozambique has at least enjoyed a year of peace, and the 6,000 Onumoz peacekeepers from Bangladesh, Brazil, Botswana, Italy, Japan, Uruguay and Zambia patrolling the roads and supply corridors can take part of the credit. Only part, because it has taken several months to get the troops in place, and during those months the peace held anyway.\nThe discipline Renamo&#x2019;s guerrillas have shown in holding to the peace accord has surprised everyone. People now routinely say they are far more disciplined than the Government troops. The suburbs of Maputo are no longer being raided and the Central Hospital has far fewer recent amputees. It still has some, because more than a million mines were strewn throughout Mozambique and dislocated people returning home have been stepping on them.\nAmong Onumoz personnel there are two theories about this year of astonishing peace. The first is that it is a solid achievement in itself, because it is getting Mozambicans accustomed to peace. Even if the negotiations go nowhere, people will be less likely to return to war. The second theory is that it is a problem in disguise, because it removes any need for the parties to negotiate seriously. Meanwhile, Onumoz is costing the United Nations about $850,000 a day.\nOn the last day of his visit, Boutros-Ghali calls a news conference and announces a breakthrough. President Chissano and Dhlakama have agreed on the composition of the electoral commission. They have also agreed to maintain continuous direct negotiations in Maputo until a date for the beginning of demobilization is agreed on.\nAfter the news conference, Boutros-Ghali boards a plane for Nairobi. On the plane, he looks tired. &#x201C;I believe that I&#x2019;ve provoked a kind of awareness of the possibility that the United Nations will not participate seriously in the operation in the case that they continue to create mutual difficulties,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;The stick is, Look, there is a competition all over the world. We are trying to obtain money now for Gaza and West Bank. We are trying to obtain money for Yugoslavia. And because there is no progress, you will be completely marginalized.&#x201D;\nYes, he is pleased, but he is also perfectly aware that the whole thing can fall apart tomorrow. Or it can make great strides for three months and then suddenly collapse. Or the Mozambicans might have their election and then go back to war. Recalling the Egyptian-Israeli negotiations of 1978, he says: &#x201C;I learned the Sisyphus myth, that you have to work, work, work, and you can return to square zero, and you must have the patience, the courage to begin again. This is essential. Otherwise you are not a good negotiator. Never give up!&#x201D;\nIT IS ON THIS AFRICAN TRIP that I begin to get my own sense of Boutros-Ghali.\nHe gives an impression of nervousness in interviews. He fidgets with pieces of paper, folding and unfolding them dozens of times. On the plane, a narrow crevice between his fold-down table and the wall often proves irresistible. While explaining to me some element of policy, he will be intently trying to jam a paper into that crack. It crosses my mind that his famous aloofness may spring from shyness. Another factor may be his imperfect English. He occasionally gets lost in the thicket of a sentence and has to hack his way out. &#x201C;He gets frustrated in English and tends to raise his voice,&#x201D; says Rolf Knuttson, a member of his office. &#x201C;It makes him seem angry, when he&#x2019;s not. He never raises his voice in French.&#x201D;\nHe has the deep intellectual pride of a man who spent decades studying and teaching in the bosom of a European culture that views intellectuals as a distinct and honored class. Once he feels he knows a subject, his confidence in his opinions seems unshakable. And he is particularly proud of his knowledge of Africa.\n&#x201C;The origin is one very personal emotion,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;My grandfather signed the famous agreement of 1899, creating the condominium, the Anglo-Egyptian-Sudan. And when I was a small kid, the kids were saying, &#x2018;Your grandfather has sold the Sudan to the British!&#x2019; For me, what did &#x2018;Sudan&#x2019; mean? O.K., you can sell a car, but to sell a country? So when I was a student, there was an excursion to Khartoum in 1942, 1943 and I asked to participate. That was my first contact.\n&#x201C;In Paris, I chose the studies on colonial law. Later, I published many essays on African problems, and even created a sub-department on African affairs. I followed with great attention the creation of the Organization of African Unity. I wrote many books in English, French and Arabic on this organization. I created the African Society for Political Science. I created the African Society for Political Law. And when I was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs in November &#x2019;77, in spite of the huge crisis of the Middle East, which was the visit of Sadat, I always find time to pay attention to Africa. At the time I was accused, the media was saying, &#x2018;Because Egypt has been excluded from the Arab world, she is trying to find another backyard, and Boutros-Ghali is paying attention to Africa.&#x2019; So when I come to Africa, I know the leaders, I know the background, I know the mentality and I am at ease with them.&#x201D;\nBoutros-Ghali&#x2019;s relentlessly formal view of the United Nations and his role in it is problematic. This Cartesian approach can result in inflexibility. For example, he will defend some action he has taken not on moral or practical grounds but on the grounds that he was given a mandate by the Security Council, and a decision by the Security Council represents &#x201C;the will of the international community.&#x201D; Therefore, he is executing the will of the international community. Q.E.D. There is, as well, a certain contradiction between his two views of himself: as the impersonal executor of the Security Council&#x2019;s will and as a forward-looking agent of change.\nYou rarely forget, in talking to him, that he was a professor for 30 years. He pursues questions down the various possible logical pathways and rarely agrees with what you say, not necessarily because he believes you are wrong but because the argument, like a mountain, is there and he must climb it.\nMadeleine Albright, the United States representative at the United Nations, calls this his &#x201C;dialectical&#x201D; streak and she doesn&#x2019;t seem to appreciate it much. His famous &#x201C;wog&#x201D; comment is probably attributable to this tendency. He tells me he did not personally believe his ethnicity was an element in the British press&#x2019;s treatment of him. But he does not regret the comment because he said &#x201C;maybe,&#x201D; and you cannot rule out the possibility, since surely I would agree there is such a thing as national prejudices.\nIn short, he is an academic, not a diplomat. In fact, he tends to look on the word &#x201C;diplomat&#x201D; as pejorative. &#x201C;If you stick to principles,&#x201D; he tells me, &#x201C;you are not a diplomat&#x201D; &#x2014; a startling comment from the world&#x2019;s top diplomat.\nA PHENOMENON OF THE post-cold-war world, says Shashi Tharoor, a United Nations peacekeeping official, is &#x201C;a new transcendence&#x201D; of the global news media. &#x201C;The media now shows us a situation in a manner that clamors for international response. So as the world says: &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t just stand there. Do something!&#x2019; the Council is obliged to consider what it can do. In the cases of the former Yugoslavia and Somalia, it has used the one available institution that has existed, has worked &#x2014; peacekeeping. But this has meant sending peacekeepers where there was no peace to keep. It&#x2019;s particularly ironic that peacekeeping has been taken and put into this &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t just stand there. Do something&#x2019; syndrome, because peacekeeping has often worked best when it&#x2019;s &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t do something. Just stand there!&#x2019; &#x201C;\nIn October, television and magazines drilled home the image of a man dancing in front of the burning wreckage of a helicopter on a street in Mogadishu. He was holding a twig, at the end of which dangled a twisted lump &#x2014; a torn scrap of an American soldier&#x2019;s uniform. The ghastly thin dancing man looked like Death and the sinewy scrap of uniform he was dangling before his laughing, gaping mouth might have been roasted flesh. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t just stand there. Do something!&#x201D; became &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t just stand there. Run!&#x201D; Washington was in full scramble. Congress was threatening to force Clinton to withdraw the troops immediately.\nOn Oct. 22, Boutros-Ghali flies to Mogadishu to show support, he says, for the staff in the field. Returning to Nairobi the same afternoon, he gives a news conference. A reporter asks him whether the United Nations is still trying to capture Aidid and he gives his stock answer. He has a mandate and his job as Secretary General is to implement the mandate.\nOn the flight out of Nairobi to Addis Ababa, Boutros-Ghali tells me that Aidid has captured all the attention because he is &#x201C;Zorro against Superman, David against Goliath. The press talked to Aidid and took photos of Aidid, but not a word was given to Ali Mahdi&#x201D; &#x2014; Aidid&#x2019;s rival. &#x201C;We said to Ali Mahdi, &#x2018;Why don&#x2019;t you talk?&#x2019; and he said, &#x2018;I give four interviews to CNN but they never produced them.&#x2019; So the image very often doesn&#x2019;t correspond to the reality.&#x201D;\nThe following day, after he has seen the news reports on his own visit, he has more to say. &#x201C;It was exaggerated, what was said everywhere. In Mogadishu, I have my report, because I have a whole team of Egyptians there and they would not lie. It was 200 small kids, making a manifestation. It was just less than 200 small kids who received money and burned a few tires in the middle of the road. And they make out of it a big fuss.&#x201D;\nLike most public figures, Boutros-Ghali is sensitive to bad press and, like most of them, he insists it doesn&#x2019;t bother him. He says it is an inevitable consequence of negotiating. &#x201C;Once you are involved in any kind of mediation, you must accept in advance that you will be accused of partiality. . . . This is the rule of the game &#x2014; that you have been created to serve as a scapegoat. In the case you are successful, you must disappear, to let the other people say, &#x2018;We have done this on our own.&#x2019; And in the case you fail you must accept that you will be accused of all the failures.&#x201D;\nThis is perfectly true, and yet it can be carried too far. If you are too aware that you will always be criticized no matter what you do, how do you recognize those times when you are being criticized fairly? I am never reassured that Boutros-Ghali acknowledges there are such times.\nAidid&#x2019;s dislike of Boutros-Ghali is well known. People at the United Nations say that when the American-led forces were in charge in Mogadishu from December 1992 through April 1993, The United States special envoy, Robert Oakley, was under strict orders from Washington not to incur any American casualties. So he was careful to stay on good terms with Aidid, the warlord who controlled the port and the area around the American headquarters. But, some American diplomats say, Boutros-Ghali entertained a grand vision of the U.N. rebuilding Somalia as a nation.\nHe kept calling on the Americans to disarm the clans. They declined (no casualties, remember) and handed the operation over to the much weaker United Nations forces, which had a Security Council mandate to oversee a March 1993 accord reached in Addis Ababa that dictated disarmament. The U.N. command made it clear they expected disarming to go forward and they also began to set up district councils that were supposed to be the fundaments of a new political structure. Naturally, because Aidid wanted to be the next dictator of Somalia, he felt threatened by this and started attacking U.N. forces.\nBoutros-Ghali seems not to have realized that his background would also be a major problem in Somalia. &#x201C;I think he made a bad mistake in not saying that because of his background and experience and the part of the world he&#x2019;s from, he should step away from Somalia,&#x201D; says a long-time observer of the United Nations who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. He cites a U.N. tradition of not putting peacekeepers or negotiators in a situation where there would be conflicting national interests. &#x201C;You had Perez de Cuellar and Giandomenico Picco running between Iran and Iraq. Well, that&#x2019;s not a bad combination &#x2014; Peru and Italy. If you&#x2019;ve run foreign affairs in Egypt, if you have strong opinions about the Horn of Africa, you should step away.&#x201D;\nInstead, when the first U.N. envoy to Somalia, the Algerian diplomat Mohamed Sahnoun, differed with his boss publicly on U.N. peacekeeping policy, he was unceremoniously ousted. And rather than staying in the background, Boutros-Ghali has gone to Somalia not once but twice.\nWhen he arrives at an African country, Boutros-Ghali likes to open his public comments with a reference to his long association, as Egypt&#x2019;s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, with the country and its leaders and how pleased he is to be visiting now as Secretary General. In the case of Somalia, the warning bells should have been clanging. But this problem hits Boutros Ghali right in his blind spot: he is the African expert. Being an intellectual, and not a diplomat, he finds the suggestion that he might know more than is good for his job absurd.\nNonetheless, everyone I speak with, both inside and outside the United Nations, agrees that the Clinton Administration and Congress have unfairly and rather shamelessly scapegoated Boutros-Ghali when they pinned the blame on him and his representative, Adm. Jonathan Howe, for the heavy-handed manhunt for Aidid that led to the Oct. 3 disaster in Mogadishu.\n&#x201C;The Oct. 3 operation was totally an American operation,&#x201D; says Edward Luck, of the United Nations Association of the U.S.A. &#x201C;I mean, not even the U.N. commanders knew anything about it. Howe apparently learned about it at the very last moment. There was no effort to coordinate it with the U.N.&#x201D; He remembers Senator Alfonse D&#x2019;Amato of New York getting up on the Senate floor and saying something like: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s those U.N. dummies. We can&#x2019;t put our forces under U.N. dummies. Look what they do.&#x201D; Well, says Luck, &#x201C;those U.N. dummies happen to be Americans. The Rangers are very aggressive guys and they go off and do the things that are dangerous and high risk.&#x201D;\nAsked about Washington&#x2019;s treatment of him, Boutros-Ghali is determinedly low-keyed. &#x201C;I have to take into consideration the contradictions of the member states. This is my job. You know when you are beginning to work in a shop, the customer is always right. You are selling a suit and I don&#x2019;t like it. You will not say, &#x2018;No, but the suit is good!&#x2019; No, no! You will say&#x201D; &#x2014; here he makes a gesture of submission and infinite patience, the bright minion endeavoring to calm his dim lord &#x2014; &#x201C;Yes, sir! We will change it if you want.&#x201D;\nThe Americans, he admits, &#x201C;complicate my job. The only consolation is that they are not the only ones who complicate my job. In August, it was the Italians. You see, if you don&#x2019;t have a philosophical attitude, you will not be able to do this kind of job.&#x201D;\nHelping him turn the other cheek was a formulation one might call the Useful Scapegoat Principle. &#x201C;The U.N. was created for whom? To help the member states. If member states are in difficulties and they can just put the blame on the U.N., in a certain way you are helping. I can give you an example related to my country. One year after the creation of the U.N., the Government of Prime Minister Noukrachi wanted the abolition of the treaty which was concluded between Egypt and Great Britain. Great Britain was not ready at all. It had other things to do in 1946 than pay attention to a treaty that was concluded in Egypt. The Government was in a very difficult position. Noukrachi decided to go to the U.N. And the Security Council adopted a resolution saying the two parties had to talk directly to each other, which means nothing. He returned to Egypt and it was considered the biggest victory. The fact that we were able to complain against Great Britain to the U.N. and that the delegate of Egypt was insulting the delegate of Great Britain in the Security Council, in New York, was a great victory. In other words, if the U.N. helps to diffuse the tension existing between two countries &#x2014; why not?&#x201D;\nIN NEW YORK, THE SECURITY Council seems locked perpetually in session, and on the 38th floor of the Secretariat Boutros-Ghali keeps a busy schedule of consultations with ambassadors, envoys and heads of state. Often, he doesn&#x2019;t return to his official residence until 8 or 9 P.M. and frequently goes to his office for more work on Saturdays.\nMeanwhile, in the austere halls outside the delegates&#x2019; lounge and the Security Council chambers, the agonies of the former Yugoslavia are a heavy, intermittent presence. Now and then, the President of Bosnia, Alija Izetbegovic, comes through New York and consults with the Security Council. Each time, he seems to be retreating further into an irreal world of principle. And each time he looks older and more tired.\nThe Croats threatened in September that they would not renew the mandate for the United Nations forces arrayed between them and the Serbs of Krajina, a region in Croatia, because the U.N. was not disarming the Serbs or helping restore Croatian authority in Serb-held areas. But then they allow themselves to be talked out of it, because if the forces left they would have to start fighting the Croatian Serbs again, at a time when they are getting along well with the Bosnian Serbs in their joint project of carving up Bosnia.\nThe Serbs representing the new Yugoslavia wander like ghosts through the halls and hang around the delegates&#x2019; lounge, because they have been denied the old Yugoslavia seat in the General Assembly pending a formal reapplication. They have failed to submit one, telling anyone who will listen that they have no control over the Bosnian Serbs or the Croatian Serbs.\nThe United Nations has gotten pushed and pulled into Yugoslavia by the familiar forces of a public demanding action and governments&#x2019; efforts to satisfy these demands by resolutions in the Security Council. Initially baby steps down the slippery slope, these resolutions have degenerated into empty promises of intervention. Kofi Annan, Under Secretary General for Peacekeeping Operations, has a flexible and sensible attitude about this problem. In describing the difficulties of peacekeeping in Bosnia, he stresses that Security Council resolutions more often than not get in the way. They tend to polarize the sides, as one group or another becomes obsessed with the perceived unfairness of a certain resolution. &#x201C;Forget the resolutions,&#x201D; Annan tells them. &#x201C;We know where we want to go. Let&#x2019;s figure out how to get there.&#x201D;\nBoutros-Ghali&#x2019;s reluctance to get the U.N. involved in Bosnia is well known. He is often quoted as having said that Bosnia was a &#x201C;rich man&#x2019;s war,&#x201D; but he insists he was misunderstood. He was, he says, referring to the amount of attention Bosnia was getting compared with other areas of conflict. He argues that since the European Community was already involved in the former Yugoslavia, he saw dangers in bringing in the United Nations because the parties to the conflict would then be able to play one organization off against the other.\nThe United Nations Charter directs it to rely on regional organizations when possible. Since the European Community is one of the richest regional organizations in the world, it might make sense for the community to deal with Yugoslavia and free U.N. funds for operations in areas where such groups are poor. The European Community, however, has declared itself incapable of acting without the U.N. umbrella.\nThen there is Haiti.\nIn early October, some Haitians yelled on the dock of Port-au-Prince that they would turn Haiti into another Somalia. They sent an American ship, the Harlan County, with 200 American and Canadian engineers and advisers packing. After the Harlan County left, the U.N. withdrew its observers from Haiti, the Security Council reimposed trade sanctions and the debate turned to how many Haitian children were dying each month as a result of the embargo.\nSome editorialists scoffed at the United States and the United Nations running from a few &#x201C;thugs.&#x201D; But haven&#x2019;t we been assured before that an operation, like the manhunt for Aidid, is only a matter of cowing a few &#x201C;thugs&#x201D;? Why are thugs easier to fight than soldiers? One can argue that thugs are harder to fight. Since they are not answerable to anyone, you can&#x2019;t pressure them politically. You can only try to find them and kill them, and in doing so you kill a lot of bystanders. The thugs, not being stupid, help you do this. You begin to lose support among the very people you set out to help, who start to look on the thugs as their defenders. And there you are, talking about your &#x201C;credibility,&#x201D; hip-deep in the muck and morally lost.\nThe withdrawal of the U.N. forces from Haiti, Boutros-Ghali tells me, was necessitated by Washington&#x2019;s decision not to dock the Harlan County. He shrugs and says: &#x201C;I return to my old theory. If the member states do not want to implement a resolution, we can do nothing.&#x201D;\nIF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO TALK about fulfilling the potential of the United Nations Charter, they ought to recognize that the charter was written by war-making countries. These were countries accustomed to the deliberate firebombing of major cities, whose millions of soldiers occupied Europe, North Africa and much of Asia. The Churchillian words of article 42 came easily to them: the Security Council &#x201C;may take such action by air, sea or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.&#x201D;\nThe framers of the charter were victors, with a clear and unembarrassed conviction that they had the right to dictate to other people what was good for them. One of the U.N.&#x2019;s first major acts &#x2014; a model of cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States &#x2014; had nothing to do with repelling aggression against one of its members or relieving a humanitarian crisis. It was the partition of Palestine, against the repeated protests of the Arab countries, member states all.\nNow, 45 years later, the Security Council has reactivated article 42, and the world seems to be surprised that it is a war-making mechanism. In April, the Secretary General established a Situation Center to keep tabs on the many peacekeeping missions around the world (see map on page 22). Temporarily set up in a building across the street from the Secretariat, the Situation Center itself is a large windowless room with desks and computer monitors. The military personnel from member nations are on 24-hour duty and are paid for by their own countries.\nThe problem these days when man-made disasters strike with increasing frequency is that not only do Americans have no apparent desire to fight wars for the sake of security in the Horn of Africa or humanitarianism in general, but they are no longer convinced of the inherent rightness of any project they undertake. And Americans are not the only ones who think this way.\nHowever, if the 184 members of the United Nations are serious about their world organization, they need to decide under what circumstances and in pursuit of what goals they are willing to suffer casualties. They need to acknowledge to their citizens that if they participate in U.N. peacekeeping or &#x201C;peace-enforcing&#x201D; operations, they will suffer casualties. They have to define what sorts of things affect their national security in that circle beyond the innermost one of direct attack and interruption of vital trade. They have to discuss what they are willing to do to protect those interests. And they have wrestle with a question raised by Margaret Thatcher in May: If Bosnia is not in our sphere of interest, should it be in our sphere of conscience?\nIn the United States, we have to invoke a more subtle range of lessons from the past than Vietnam (quagmire; do not engage) and Hitler (can&#x2019;t appease; engage). The Clinton Administration is currently trying to thrash out some of these ideas. A classified document recently making the rounds in Washington proposed that the United States support the use of force by the Security Council in cases of &#x201C;international aggression, a humanitarian disaster requiring urgent action coupled with violence, a sudden and unexpected interruption of established democracy or gross violation of human rights coupled with violence.&#x201D; If a U.N. operation is to include American troops, the document continued, more requirements must be met: most notably, American national interest must be directly affected and Congress must support the deployment.\nIn a recent speech to the Council of Foreign Relations, the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, set out to define the Administration&#x2019;s plan to replace the cold war doctrine of containment with a strategy of &#x201C;enlargement.&#x201D; It consists of four components: strengthening &#x201C;major market democracies&#x201D;; &#x201C;consolidating democracy and markets in states of special significance or opportunity&#x201D;; countering the aggression &#x201C;of states hostile to democracy and markets&#x201D; and &#x201C;pursuing humanitarian goals and limiting sectarian conflict in regions of greatest concern.&#x201D;\n&#x201C;American efforts to foster freedom must be tightly targeted and demand-driven,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;CNN is not a compass for American interests. We cannot act on the urge, rooted as it is in good intentions, to respond to every crisis.&#x201D;\nAs discussions continue on what constitutes &#x201C;national interest,&#x201D; people also need to agree on what they mean by &#x201C;the United Nations,&#x201D; since in different contexts they mean different things. When the public reads about something the Security Council has decided, it thinks &#x201C;U.N.&#x201D; But people in the Secretariat look at the decisions by the Security Council and think &#x201C;member states.&#x201D; When President Clinton said in his address to the General Assembly in September, &#x201C;If the American people are to say yes to U.N. peacekeeping, the United Nations must know when to say no,&#x201D; he was speaking to the Security Council, which authorizes those operations. But the United States is a permanent member with vetoing power in the Security Council, so the President was really talking to his own Administration.\nWhen critics charge that &#x201C;the U.N.&#x201D; takes six months to get troops into place after a peacekeeping operation is authorized, they seem to be referring to the Secretariat. But member states are slow to send their troops. The Secretariat would not have to wait for members to contribute troops if it had its own army, or designated standby units, as both the charter and Boutros-Ghali envision, but the member states refuse to authorize either of these things.\nMember states complain about the budget, but member states pass the budget. And the United States, with the largest assessment (it&#x2019;s based primarily on gross national product), can&#x2019;t complain it is outvoted by a bunch of little countries whose assessments are practically nothing because for years now the budget has been set by consensus.\nIn the case of Somalia, the confusion over &#x201C;the U.N.&#x201D; especially points up the dangers of not having worked out an agreement for American troops to serve under United Nations command. The Force Commander in Somalia, the Turkish Lieut. Gen. Cevik Bir, is United Nations. His deputy commander is Maj. Gen. Thomas Montgomery, an American. As Deputy Force Commander, Montgomery is United Nations. But as field commander of the American Quick Reaction Force, he reports to the United States Central Command in Tampa, Fla., so he is United States. Then there is Admiral Howe. He is Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s special representative, but he is also an American with extensive connections in Washington, which he used to garner support for his manhunt for Aidid. Is he United Nations or United States? The question cannot really be answered, and that is a problem. In its reluctance to put its troops under United Nations command, the United States cobbled together a compromise of confused responsibility that probably put its troops in more danger.\nAs for the Secretary General and his role, Boutros-Ghali not only carries out the Security Council&#x2019;s vague and sometimes tortured directives but he writes the reports on which the Council partly bases some of those directives. But to talk about &#x201C;Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s U.N.,&#x201D; as many do, is misleading. It is Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s Secretariat, not his U.N. And the personality traits that many complain about have more of an effect on morale in the Secretariat than they do on security in the world. His retreat over the policy in Somalia shows that it is just as much, if not more, Bill Clinton&#x2019;s U.N. &#x2014; which may explain why the U.N. seems adrift at the moment, since Bill Clinton isn&#x2019;t paying much attention.\nIn its role as guarantor of international peace and security, &#x201C;the U.N.&#x201D; is much more the Security Council than it is the Secretariat. But how coherent an entity is the Security Council? As a body with an intention and a will, does it exist any more than &#x201C;Europe&#x201D; does? The permanent five are all preoccupied with their own problems. Russia is busy rewriting its Constitution, electing its Parliament and fighting hyperinflation. President Clinton has had his hands full trying to pass his budget, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Brady Bill, a health care program. . . . China is the phantom of the Council. The three pillars of its policy seem to be negative: don&#x2019;t discuss human rights, don&#x2019;t mention Tibet and don&#x2019;t let Taiwan into the U.N. France and Britain are the most committed multilaterists. Unfortunately, they often disagree with each other. In any event, both countries have been preoccupied with serious downturns in their economy.\nThen there is the question of the Security Council&#x2019;s legitimacy as a representative of &#x201C;the international community.&#x201D; World War II was won quite a while ago. Germany and Japan both indicate that they wouldn&#x2019;t mind being permanent members, and the prospect of getting more money out of them for the cash-starved United Nations is inviting, although &#x2014; for the time being &#x2014; both are trying to pull out of their economic doldrums. But admitting them would only tilt the Council further toward the developed world.\nThere are proposals to include other powers in the Council, but who would they be and who would choose them? India seems an obvious choice, unless you happen to be from Pakistan. Nigeria is the most populous nation in Africa, but it is currently in turmoil. And do you give these new permanent members vetoes or would that hobble the Council again? These are probably insoluble political problems. The only way to come up with a more up-to-date Council might be to fight another world war and hand it once more to the victors.\nWith its haziness of outline, &#x201C;the U.N.&#x201D; becomes an irresistible target for blame when something goes wrong. Since the organization is, in a sense, everybody, it is also always somebody else. This feeds into, and off, a certain knee-jerk anti-U.N. attitude in some quarters in the United States that is a combination of simple nativism, a cultural distrust of government and a visceral hatred of bureaucracy.\nThere is a danger here. The United Nations is dependent on good will and good press. Countries are only too happy to have an excuse to withhold their assessments. And the U.N. not only has no army and no treasury, but it also has no constituency. If the end of the 20th century is teaching us anything, it is that nationalism is stronger than ever. The U.N. has no anthem to sing and although it does have a flag &#x2014; a map of the world &#x2014; at its center lies the North Pole, where no one lives.\nMY LAST MEETING WITH Boutros-Ghali is at 3 Sutton Place, the handsome Georgian manor near the East River that was built for J. P. Morgan&#x2019;s daughter and was donated to the U.N. Association in 1972 for use as the Secretary General&#x2019;s residence.\nBoutros-Ghali is at his most charming. He is more relaxed than I have yet seen him, either because it is Sunday and he is at home or because, after six meetings, he is getting used to me.\n&#x201C;The last time I saw you, in the London airport, you looked like this!&#x201D; he says delightedly, stretching stiffly back in his chair like a corpse, mouth open. (I had gotten sick in Africa, before proceeding to London.) He tells me a couple of amusing anecdotes about his negotiations for the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty and takes me on a tour of the residence.\nIn every room, there are ancient bronze birds from Egypt and Persia, which he has been collecting for years. He directs a light on them, so that I can see the intricate shadow-lines left behind by the long-vanished gold. He points out the Matisse and the Leger and the Bonnard that are on loan from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art. He waves at the Utrillo, which Leia, his wife, has picked out and which he does not like. He and his wife have a whole routine, which they seem to enjoy. He complains about her nagging or some wrongheaded decision she has made. But when she appears, a quite imposing tall blonde, he steps away, meekly draws in his head and says, &#x201C;She&#x2019;s the boss!&#x201D;\nBoutros-Ghali and I settle down for a few questions. Is the role that he frequently sees for himself as Secretary General &#x2014; that of the humble servant patiently taking knocks from an imperious master &#x2014; modeled on his experiences as a Copt in Egypt, as someone who, though wealthy and from a proud family, has had to accept that he will never quite belong?\nHe will have none of it. &#x201C;I never felt this during all the 68 years I spent of my life in Egypt. I never felt this at all, maybe because I belonged to the haute bourgeoisie. I have always had Muslim friends, Jewish friends.&#x201D; He attributes his ability to be self-effacing to the fact that he has been trained to do this kind of work.\nWhen I ask if he had difficulty adjusting to this role, for the only time in our talks he acknowledges that the humble servant occasionally blows up at the master who is not as bright.\n&#x201C;Even now, I am not good at this. The fact that I have so many troubles is that very often rather than keep quiet, I just say loudly what I think. I had trouble with the Israelis, during my negotiations with them, and I have trouble with many people, because on the contrary I am not enough trained to do this kind of thing. If you want a kind of auto-criticism.&#x201D;\nAnd is the United Nations going through a crisis of confidence right now, after the problems of the last three months?\n&#x201C;No, for me the U.N. has not changed. I am just saying that the U.S. as a major actor is passing by a crisis of less support for the U.N., period. What I am saying is, in my own interpretation, that this is tactical and not strategic. That they will return back to the U.N. and give the same support, after the crisis will get over.&#x201D;\nI bring up Mozambique. Have the negotiations continued to make progress after his departure? He is surprised by the question and brightens. &#x201C;Oh yes, yes! It is a success story! Which don&#x2019;t appear in the press! The press likes the return of Zorro!&#x201D;\nA few days later I call Aldo Ajello, Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s special representative in Maputo. He says that the Secretary General&#x2019;s visit has made great progress possible. The electoral law has been approved and 20 troop assembly areas have been opened, with the first groups of Government and Renamo fighters arriving just a few days previously, for disarmament and demobilization. Ajello thinks they might make the October 1994 deadline for elections.\n&#x201C;The fundamental decision made by Renamo since Boutros-Ghali&#x2019;s visit is to give up the military option,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;The only problem now &#x2014; but it is a big problem &#x2014; is the financial problem. Renamo still wants money.&#x201D; Ajello is asking for a new trust fund of $4 million, to be set up under more flexible rules than the U.N.-administered fund they already have. &#x201C;But the money is just not coming. I am afraid to say, the international community is much more willing to fund war than peace. If this money doesn&#x2019;t come through, the whole thing will collapse.&#x201D;\nI hang up with the impresssion that Ajello and Onumoz have a tough, complicated job to do and that they seem to be tackling it as well as anyone can. And if it all fails for lack of a trust fund, who will be responsible? The United Nations-as-Secretariat, for the bureaucratic rigidity of the first trust fund for Mozambique? Or the United Nations-as-member-states, for the unwillingness to cough up a paltry $4 million for the stabilization of Mozambique?\nImpossible to answer. The only sure thing is, if Mozambique fails, fingers will be pointing, all around the circle."}, {"text": "Aunt Jemima Is Least of U.S. Blacks' Worries\n1994-10-27T05:00:00.000Z\nTo the Editor:\nRe \"Aunt Jemima Gets a Makeover\" by Brent Staples (Editorial Notebook, Oct. 19): It amazes me how some African-Americans misplace their ire on racial inequality issues and perceptions of inferiority. As an African-born American, I cannot comprehend how the picture of a black man on a box of rice demeans my sense of being or harms my status and capability in the society.\nI do not intend to disregard factual incidents of racism. Neither am I ignorant of history. The reality is that a black child born in America today has a lower life expectancy than a Bangladeshi similarly born. As the father of a 10-year-old son, I am bothered by that a lot. Insofar as the same oddity does not apply to a Caucasian born in America, I am perplexed at this inequality.\nFurthermore, within the course of his lower life expectancy, we are told, the African child born in America may very likely not earn as much as his Caucasian colleague, and he is more likely to be killed as a result of a criminal act perpetrated by a member of his race.\nIt seems to me that the issue that impacts the dignity, survival and prosperity of an African-American is more a matter of equal opportunity in the areas of academic excellence and economic well-being than it is of whether an Uncle Ben or a Betty Crocker adorns the package of a food item or a household product. Ken Smikle, the publisher of Target Market News, should get a grip on the real issues that confront African-Americans in today's America. KINGSLEY SOSOO Brooklyn, Oct. 20, 1994"}]
