Rather, it concluded, the answers must be found in ''human vulnerability resulting from poverty and inequality; environmental degradation owing to poor land use; and rapid population growth, especially among the poor.''\nTraditional relief in the form of food, medicine and other emergency measures usually arrives too late, does not meet the most pressing problems and, by reinforcing the existing political and social order, often helps block changes needed to prevent another disaster, the report said.\nThe study was written by Anders Wijkman, secretary general of the Swedish Red Cross, and Lloyd Timberlake, editorial director of Earthscan. Treating 'Ever-Growing Wounds'\nAt a news briefing this week, Mr. Timberlake said the book had been written because of a growing realization that traditional disaster relief was no more than ''small Band-Aids applied to ever-growing wounds.''\nThe report said that ''trigger events,'' such as heavy rains, lack of rain, tidal waves and earthquakes, often touch off disasters because conditions have been created for such disasters by human activity.\nThe famine in Ethiopia is caused not by the lack of rain that triggered it, the report said, but by agricultural practices and deforestation that produced soil erosion, by population growth and by political decisions such as an emphasis on cash crops and a failure to develop adequate distribution systems.\nFloods and Deforestation\nFloods in Bangladesh were caused by deforestation of the Himalayas hundreds of miles away and by overcrowding in what is essentially a narrow flood plain, the report said.\nMr. Timberlake said it was now possible to look at economic and social developments and predict disasters. For example, because traders have been pushing up the price of seed in Bangladesh, ''the next children you will see dying on your TV screens will be Bengali children,'' he predicted.\nThe 148-page report can be obtained from Earthscan, 1717 Massachusetts Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036, for $5.50 a copy.\npls do not bite LAST GRAF OF DISASTER..IT'S A MUST",

    "text": "NEW VARIETIES OF HARDY RICE HOLD PROMISE\n1984-08-14T05:00:00.000Z\nLOS BANOS, THE PHILIPPINES\nIN the shadow of verdant tropical mountains, scientists have developed a number of promising new\nstrains of rice in an effort to extend the Green\nRevolution to the hundreds of millions of Asians it has thus far failed to reach.\nThe new varieties promise to give high yields without the costly irrigation required by the earlier ''miracle'' rice strains developed at the International Rice Research Institute here. The new strains have not yet been tested in farmers' fields, but one particularly promising variety has produced test yields more than twice as large as those from traditional varieties.\nIf this and other new varieties being developed are successful, the resulting increase in the production of rice in nonirrigated areas would benefit the diets and household incomes of many of the two billion people, mostly in the developing countries of Asia, who eat rice as their staple and sell any surplus in good years.\nFrom 1960 to 1980, average yields in tropical Asia increased 40 percent, and the development of high-yielding varieties of rice was one of the main reasons for the improvement. But in the poorest nations that need it most - half the food energy consumed in developing nations comes from rice - the benefits of this Green Revolution have been limited, largely because these countries are least able to afford the irrigation and commercial fertilizer that make it possible.\n''The challenge we face now is to bring the Green Revolution to ecologically and economically disadvantaged farmers,'' said M. S. Swaminathan, director-general of the institute, which is 40 miles southeast of Manila.\nIn the 1960's the first frontier of modern rice genetics was crossed: the breeding of high-yielding varieties. These new strains, known as semidwarf varieties, promised greatly increased food production for much of the world, especially tropical Asia. However, these shorter and more lush rice plants often proved to be attractive to pests and susceptible to disease.\nSo in the 1970's the mission of rice scientists became to develop high- yielding strains that were also resistant to disease and insect pests. That second frontier, too, was crossed, and once again the institute led the way. A strain called IR-36, the progeny of 13 different varieties from six countries, is the best example of that effort. First planted by farmers in the Philippines in 1976, IR-36 is now grown on more than 24.7 million acres of rice lands throughout the world.\nToday, the geneticists and researchers here, 40 miles southeast of Manila, are exploring what is regarded as the third frontier: developing higher-yielding varieties of rice that do not need to be irrigated. The rice of nonirrigated areas, both upland and lowland, is commonly known as rain-fed rice.\nProgress is likely to proceed gradually for two main reasons. First, breakthroughs inevitably become harder to come by as the work advances. Second, while the irrigated environments for earlier high-yielding varieties tend to be uniform, the adverse conditions of rain-fed areas vary tremendously. Some areas are drought-prone, but others are frequently flooded.\nThe range of conditions varies not only from place to place but, given the monsoon cycles of the tropics, also from one month to the next in the same place. Thus the high- yielding varieties for difficult conditions will have to be essentially custom-made.\nNonetheless Mr. Swaminathan expects significant improvements in the yields of rain-fed rice by the end of the decade.\nPromising New Strains\nIrrigated fields now occupy about 30 percent of the rice-production acreage in tropical developing countries, in contrast to a 98 percent irrigation ratio in wealthy Japan and about 80 percent in such newly industrializing nations as South Korea and Taiwan.\nIrrigated fields, which can use high-yielding varieties, average five to six metric tons of rice per hectare (2.47 acres). Nonirrigated areas average one to two metric tons a hectare. Narrowing that gap in yield is what the breeders, geneticists and others in the International Rice Research Institute's 2,200-member staff are working toward.\nAlready they have come up with several new rain-fed varieties that seem promising. One of these is IR- 13146, the result of more than 10,000 crosses of one variety with another. So far it has shown itself to be a sturdy, strain, resistant to insect pests like green leafhopper and plant blight like tungro virus, as well as attaining rather high and stable yield in difficult conditions.\nIn tests at agricultural research stations in 19 locations, including Thailand, Burma, Bangladesh and India, it posted an average yield of 3.9 tons per hectare. ''That's what we're after,'' notes David J. Mackill, a breeder at the institute.\nStill, IR-13146 and other varieties that seem well-suited for rain-fed conditions have not yet passed the important test in farmers' fields. A few varieties have either been recently released to farmers through national rice programs or soon will be. But it takes a number of seasons under farm conditions before a variety can be declared a winner.\nThe rice experts caution against too much optimism. ''Though some of these varieties are called miracle rice,'' Mr. Swaminathan said, ''there are no real miracles in agricultural development. It is a long, hard, step- by-step road.''\nElite 'Rice Parents' Grown\nThe road begins at a ''hybridization block,'' a well-irrigated rice field with hundreds of different varieties growing in neat rows, surrounded at intervals by small concrete walkways. It is here that ''rice parents'' are being grown. Some are so-called elite varieties, meaning that they have several desired characteristics. Others are donors, usually traditional strains that have at least one beneficial trait. Pankhari, a traditional variety from India, is a typical donor. Pankhari is no miracle rice, but it is resistant to tungro virus, which can devastate a rice field.\nWhen a breeder decides he wants a certain elite crossed with a selected donor variety, the panicles - the uppermost portion of the plant containing the rice grains - of the two are clipped off. The panicles are sent to a shed that looks much like a greenhouse, except that much of it is screen instead of glass.\nRice is a self-pollinating grass. The grains contain a male part, the pollen-bearing anthers, on top, and the female embryo at the bottom. To cross two varieties, the rice grain of one is clipped in half with tiny scissors. Then a minute vaccum device with a transparent nozzle is used to suck any residual anthers out of the grain.\nWhat remains is the unpollinated female part of the plant. A small cellophane bag is placed over the female to prevent unwanted pollination while the scientists wait for two rice plants to flower at the same time. They often speak as though they are dealing with people, not plants. ''Synchronizing the parents is sometimes very difficult,'' observed Mr. Mackill, a breeder who came to the institute from the University of California at Davis more than two years ago. ''They have to be in the mood.''\nAt the proper moment, when the panicle of the ''father'' begins shedding pollen, it is shaken over the unfertilized female of the other variety and a cross of the two strains is made. More than 4,000 crosses are made at the institute each year.\nAt first the new variety is pampered with plenty of water and care to make sure it is healthy. But after the first generation, the new strain is subjected to insect pests, disease and inclement weather in the rice plots in Los Banos. The fields are a riot of botanic diversity, some manicured and others overgrown with weeds, some flooded and others parched.\nIt takes four to six years from the hybridization block through the generations of evaluation and selection to the stage when a new variety, if promising, is ready for farmers to try.\n'It's a Numbers Game'\nImproving rice genetics depends partly on the art and science of the breeder's inspired selection and partly on the combined efforts of scientists in other disciplines evaluating the new strains. But success also depends on the sheer volume of crosses, shuffling the genetic deck in search of the right combinations. ''It's a numbers game,'' Mr. Mackill concedes.\nAn important tool in playing that numbers game is a giant seed bank here at the international rice germ- plasm center. Since 1971 the bank has been the central repository for the base collection of the world's rices. Today it boasts about 70,000 varieties.\nAt the center, 45 characteristics for each variety are recorded on computer printouts including size, leaf color, grain length and width, maturity cycle, disease and pest resistances, protein content and so on. This systematic catalogue makes it easier for scientists to find rices with the specific traits they desire.\n''It's like computer dating,'' said Te-Tzu Chang, a 57-year-old geneticist who heads the germ-plasm center.\nThe center is also the guardian of genetic diversity in rice. By the late 1960's, high-yielding semidwarf rices were replacing traditional varieties in many regions. Farmers were understandably pursuing higher yields. But some old lines were in danger of extinction because of the shift. Had that happened, it would have been a grave loss, especially now that scientists are trying to develop sturdier, high-yielding varieties.\nTraditional lines can make important genetic contributions as donors because they tend to be more resilient than conventional high- yielding strains. One reason is that traditional rice lines have thicker roots.\nIt is believed that there are 120,000 or so varieties of rice, and the center is trying to collect those not already in its stock. Botanists, missionaries, soldiers, students and municipal officials send in arcane varieties. Occasionally the contributors make claims that the rice sent in has certain medicinal benefits, none of which have been substantiated. Some of the varieties do not even look like rice. Mr. Chang pointed to a strain from Bangladesh, saying: ''I like to tell geneticists those are sunflower seeds. Most of them believe me until I let them know I'm joking.''\nAfter sorting and classification, the seeds are vacuum-packed and placed in cold storage rooms. One room for medium-term preservation, 30 to 40 years, contains more than 4,000 million seeds. The long-term room, housing 1,000 million seeds, is kept at temperatures well below freezing. It is designed to preserve seeds for 100 years. For extra security, the institute has deposited a duplicate set of seeds at the United States Naval Seed Storage Laboratory in Fort Collins, Colo.",

    "text": "ONE MILLION SPECIES IN PERIL\n1984-09-02T05:00:00.000Z\nTROPICAL NATURE \n By Adrian Forsyth and Kenneth Miyata. Illustrations by Sarah Landry. 248 pp. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. $16.95. THE PRIMARY SOURCE \nTropical Forests and Our Future. By Norman Myers. Illustrated. 399 pp. New York: W. W. Norton & Company. $17.95.\n\nEVER on the periphery of Western consciousness and central to the global climate and economy, the forests of the earth's tropical zones are being destroyed at an alarming rate. If the destruction continues, one million species of plants and animals could become extinct by the turn of the century. Yet the authors of ''Tropical Nature'' and ''The Primary Source'' avoid the sentimentality for lost worlds that often characterizes such arguments, to the rage of developing nations and the frustration of conservationists. In both books, the emphasis falls on empirical data; and in terms accessible to the lay reader, the authors argue forcefully that we neglect tropical forests at our peril.\nAdrian Forsyth and the late Kenneth Miyata, both Harvard-trained biologists, have provided an introduction to the natural history of the New World, or neotropical, lowland forests, Neither an identification guide nor a general survey, ''Tropical Nature'' is a detailed ecological study of what makes tropical forests tick. The first European settlers made the mistake of seeing the lush tropical forests as proof of a rich underlying soil. But a few crop plantings showed that the laterite soils were weak and easily exhausted - a ''mystery wrapped in misery.''\nIn fact, the profuse flora of the neotropics depends on the abundant rains carried by the trade winds blowing toward the Equator. This explains the intense competition high in the forest canopy among trees, vines and epiphytes, as vegetation strives upward for rain-borne nutrients. The ground fungi, meanwhile, quickly break down forest debris before it can turn to soil, and the strategies by which rain forest fauna recycle waste products to the living world are often equally intricate. As Mr. Forsyth and Mr. Miyata observe, Western man's deeply ingrained loathing of excreta does not obtain in the mature ecosystem of the tropics, where each scrap of dung is contested with Rabelaisian ardor. The infamously inert tree sloth, for example, climbs down from the canopy, at considerable energy expense, to deposit its fertilizer pellets at the base of its own tree. So many are the insects whose lives revolve Jonathan Evan Maslow, who writes about natural history, is the author of ''The Owl Papers.'' around ordure that the staphylinid beetle lures its prey by spraying a dung-like scent. \nAs researchers learn how tropical life-forms develop their myriad strategies for surviving and reproducing, a new view of evolution is emerging, one that is less theoretical and more attuned to what the authors call ''the particular and the peculiar.'' Tropical subpopulations can differ so radically that the idea of species as fixed and homogeneous entities spread over a section of the globe may have to be revised. In the view of the authors of ''Tropical Nature,'' we are dealing with ''patches of individuals, which may differ in their chemistry from one area to another.'' Such extreme forms of specialization give tropical nature its fascination - and give man the best reason for preserving it. The vast number of tropical plants producing edible fruits to spread their seeds and secondary chemical compounds to defend against herbivores constitutes a genetic and chemical storehouse of materials for agriculture, medicine and industry on a scale scarcely conceivable at present.\nIn ''The Primary Source,'' Norman Myers, the author of such distinguished works on endangered species as ''The Long African Day'' and ''The Sinking Ark,'' contends that tropical forests are ''over-exploited but under-used.'' Compared to settled agriculture and plantation forestry, man's exploitation of tropical for- ests betrays the outmoded sensibility of the hunter- gatherer societies of 10,000 years ago. Whether logging hardwood in Indonesia, burning virgin Central American forest to pasture cattle for the insatiable North American fast-food market or gathering fuel in Bangladesh, we are proceeding in a rudimentary, one-shot fashion, leaving behind damaged trees and desiccated areas that take over a century to regenerate. Less than one-twentieth of tropical forests come under any sort of management program whatever; reforestation is minimal; and governments in Asia, Africa and Latin America are pressing their land-starved peasantry to migrate into forested areas rather than implementing basic land reform.\nNortherners have so far failed to understand the connection between the fate of tropical zones and their own well-being. According to Mr. Myers, tropical forests are the basic stabilizing factor in global climate: as deforestation proceeds out of control, carbon buildup in the atmosphere (the greenhouse effect) and the increased reflection of solar energy from deforested regions (the albedo effect) begin to shift climatic zones toward the poles, changing rainfall patterns in North America and Europe. Deforestation has already engendered severe drought-flood cycles in Asia, as a result of which the Green Revolution is losing momentum. \nNevertheless, the author is reasonably hopeful that mass species extinction can be avoided by rational steps to make ''full, sustainable use of the tropical forests' myriad products.'' We have considered only one tropical plant in a hundred for use as food, for improving crops, pesticides, medicine, for fuel and the raw material for genetic engineering. Yet those plants have already supplied 1,400 anticancer compounds, including the well-known anti-leukemia drugs vincristine and vinblastine, prepared from the tropical rosy periwinkle. \nThe goal for the coming decades must be a systematic research effort underwritten by developed nations to stabilize wasteful activities in developing nations. By making secondary forests hubs of activity in agriculture, forestry and the extractive and processing industries, we will relieve the intense pressure on remaining virgin forests. Preserving the enormous genetic reservoir of the tropics may appear to run counter to economic growth, Yet scarcely a century ago, natural rubber was an exotic tropical plant, and without the rubber tire, there would have been no automobile age, no jet age, no Challenger space shuttle.B",

    "text": "FOR HOLY-HINDU CITY, PILGRIMS, PROFITS AND POLITICS\n1984-10-24T05:00:00.000Z\nWell before dawn, Hindus in loincloths and saris move quietly through the twisting six- foot-wide streets of this ancient city, heading for the stone stairs called ghats that lead down a sharp embankment to the Ganges - Mother Ganga, as it is known, the holiest body of water in the Hindu universe.\nBy the time the sun rises above the far bank, casting an ocher band across the half-mile-wide expanse of water, Brahmans have installed themselves under shoreside umbrellas that look like giant mushrooms, ready to guide the pilgrims. From a nearby temple come the sounds of bells, a conch and a raga played on a sitar.\nThe sun turns gold, and thousands of pilgrims along the four miles of ghats flock to the water's edge to welcome and worship the source of all earthly existence. Fully dressed, they immerse themselves in the river, scooping it up in cupped hands or brass vessels to offer it to Surya, the sun god.\nThey set little votive candles in the middle of handfuls of marigold blossoms and cast them adrift in tiny boats made of leaves, under the eyes of hundreds of dipping, wheeling birds.\nThey wash themselves in the muddy river, and drink from it, unmindful of the human ashes that are dumped into it at the cremation ghats nearby. Life and death, extinction and rebirth, are all of a piece to a Hindu, as a huge wall painting of Siva, the god of both destruction and fertility who is Benares's favorite, constantly reminds the pilgrims. Most Sacred Place\nScenes similar to this one have taken place day after day for thousands of years in this city, called Varanasi but known through most of the world still as Benares. It is the Hindus' most sacred place, their Mecca and Rome, the center of a belief system that sustains India to this day, the heart and soul of Hindu society.\nThe city, said Virendra Sharma, a local resident who came along for the ride to the ghats one magical dawn a few days ago, ''is India in miniature.''\nBut it is more than that. For when the sun each morning floods the row of old palaces that rise like disorderly cliffs behind the ghats, it rises on a town whose contemporaries were Babylon, Nineveh and Thebes.\nBenares is therefore not just a celebration of the Hindu conviction that all souls are part of one universal reality, or an expression of mankind's long striving to make sense of the cosmos, though it is both of those. It is also a powerful, living reminder to some who gaze on it that they are part of, and heirs to, a seamless web of humanity stretching back beyond antiquity. The Present Intrudes\nThere is a present in Benares, too. As elsewhere in this vast land struggling from a feudal past toward a modern, industrial future, the Western world has encroached in material ways unlikely to be rolled back. Automobiles, motorcycles and scooters abound. The bazaars bustle with sellers of everything from shampoo to stereo sets.\nNothing is perhaps more symbolic of this modernity than the huge concrete tower recently dedicated by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. It is a television relay station, one of about 180 that are to be functioning in India by the end of the year.\nThe modern and the ancient do not always mix well. An executive of a Western-style five-star hotel, used to living in relatively liberated Bombay but now posted here, calls the posting a ''commando training assignment,'' not least because he considers the tradition-bound, caste-dominated social system of Benares ''oppressive.''\nOther Indians raise other complaints. A Brahman woman from another city, visiting Benares for the first time since she was a girl, said she did not care much for it. ''It's too commercial,'' she said. ''I don't like this selling of religion.'' The Cremation Industry\nThere are indeed money-changers at the ghats. Most things there cost rupees, including the little candle- marigold boats. What costs a lot, however, is to be cremated, and much contention has swirled in recent years around the way the ancient custom is carried out. (Cremation is a major activity here, since devout Hindus believe that to die in Benares assures them of salvation.)\nOne man, Kailash Chandra Chowdhury, with whom Brahmans will not eat, controls the cremation industry in Benares, where 35,000 bodies are burned every year. Mr. Chowdhury also controls the profits from this.\nThere have been frequent complaints that because of heavy demand, and rapid turnover at the cremation ghats, some bodies are not completely burned. Parts of corpses are sometimes found in the water at the bathing ghats, mixing with a variety of other pollutants that, according to ecologists, have made the Ganges unfit for human contact. To devout Hindus, Mr. Sharma said, this physical pollution is largely irrelevant. The spiritual purification conferred by Mother Ganga's waters outweighs all.\nA continuing campaign to build a more efficient, publicly owned electric crematorium has had little success, partly because many Hindus prefer the old ways, and partly because of Mr. Chowdhury's powerful opposition. He calls the campaign for the electric crematorium ''naked interference with the religious faith of the Hindus.'' In Benares, that is an assertion not lightly dismissed. Celebrating a Goddess\nOne recent week, Benares went wild in celebration of the goddess Durga, consort of Siva, a martial goddess of might and force and domination. From every quarter of the city, processions of dancers, drummers and bands carried likenesses of the fearsome, eight- armed deity through thick, festive crowds, down to the ghats.\nThere, by the light of a half-moon, in a carnival atmosphere complete with peanut and ice cream vendors, statues costing several hundred dollars were immersed in the river and left there.\nAnother Durga is similarly revered in these parts, which lie on the vast fertile Gangetic plain, the Hindi-speaking heartland of northern India. She is Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who was believed by some villagers to be an incarnation of Durga after she directed the Indian military effort that secured the independence of Bangladesh in 1971.\nThis is Mrs. Gandhi's territory, her strength. She must do well in the Hindi heartland in the national election that is due by Jan. 20 if she is to maintain a comfortable majority in the new Parliament.\nMrs. Gandhi's chief lieutenants here say they believe she will get the majority.",

    "text": "WORLD'S SURGING BIRTHRATE TOPS THE MEXICO CITY AGENDA\n1984-07-29T05:00:00.000Z\nBelow, a sampling of views on population and its consequences from experts and leaders around the world. Robert S. McNamara\nFormer President of the World Bank, in Foreign Affairs (Summer 1984)\nAfter centuries of steady acceleration, overall growth rates during the last decade and a half have turned downward. This decline in the rate of population growth has led many observers to believe that the world in general, and most individual countries as well, no longer face serious population problems and, therefore, that efforts to deal with such problems can be relaxed. But this assessment is simply wrong. The fertility change which has occurred during the last decade or two has been very uneven. In particular, the statistical decline for the developing countries as a whole, and indeed for the world, is heavily skewed by the special experience of China. In many other parts of the developing world, including much of Africa, a large part of South Asia, and some countries of Latin America, no measurable or significant drop in fertility has occurred.\nIndia will more than double in the next 45 years, becoming almost 40 percent larger than China is today. Bangladesh in the same time will have nearly tripled and will have 259 million people jammed into an area, alternately swept by flood and drought, the size of the state of Wisconsin. Mexico, which today has the most rapidly growing labor force of any large country in the world, will more than double in size. And Kenya, in which 17 million people are already putting heavy pressure on the limited supply of arable land, will have quintupled. The total population of developing countries as a group, 3.3 billion in 1980, will rise to over seven billion by 2025, and to over 8.5 billion by 2050. So much, then, for the supposed end of the population explosion. cc12.9,37,12,13.6Nick Eberstadt Visiting fellow, Center for Population Studies, Harvard University\nIf the World Population Conference in Mexico City is to improve material prospects for present and future generations it must turn away from the dogmatic thinking of the current ''population debate'' and focus instead on a more practical and more uncomfortable question: the impact of bad government policy on living standards in different regions of the poor world. The ''neo-Malthusian'' doctrine promoted by many development assistance groups has ill-served the world's poor. With its emphasis on the dangers of ''uncontrolled'' population growth, it has encouraged the notion that poor people are irrational - incapable of sensible decisions about their families' well being. In its preoccupation with birth rates and growth rates rather than human lives it has lent legitimacy to forcible, and enormously injurious, population control campaigns in India, China and elsewhere. And in identifying almost any sign of poverty as proof of ''overpopulation,'' it has given leaders the excuse of blaming their people for problems created by bad government policy. Mexico City's delegations should endorse family planning without reservation. It will be more difficult to examine the connection between bad policy and persisting poverty. The critical constraint on development today is not an excessive flow of babies, or an insufficient flow of aid, but the inability or unwillingness of governments and international agencies to formulate policies conducive to economic progress. Mahathir bin Mohamad Prime Minister of Malaysia, in a 1982 interview\nWe must have a sufficiently large domestic base if we are going to industrialize. Unlike the agriculturally-based economy where the smaller the population the better it is, an industrially strong nation is very difficult to build without a sufficiently large domestic market. A big population is not harmful if the people are productive. The key word here is really ''productivity.'' Seventy million people (a five-fold increase) working very hard and producing a lot of goods could easily live in Malaysia. Lee Kuan Yew Prime Minister of Singapore, in a 1983 speech\nThe 1980 Census disclosed that whilst we have brought down the birth rate, we have reduced it most unequally. The better educated the woman is, the less children she has. A woman below age 40 with no educational qualifications, on average, produces about three children although she has limited income and few resources to give her children the extra attention, help and stimulation required. With primary education, she produces about two on the average; with secondary education, 1 1/4; with upper secondary education, 1Y; with tertiary edcuation, 1 1/4. Indira Gandhi Prime Minister of India, accepting the United Nations Population Award in 1983\nLong years before our independence we realized that poverty could not be effectively combated unless the size of the family was limited to enable each child to have a better share of resources and opportunities. India was the first to adopt family planning as its official policy. While special funds and staff are earmarked for this program, we also recognize that the task has to be dovetailed into our general programs of health and education. The Government can only act with the consent and the cooperation of the people. Our family planning program is entirely voluntary... Daniel arap Moi President of Kenya, in an address in June 1983\nKenya's high population growth has led to unsustainable pressure on arable land, giving rise, in many cases, to erosion and loss of soil fertility while encouraging unplanned settlement in marginal areas and mounting rural-to- urban migration, especially by members of the younger generation. Julian L. Simon Professor of Business and Social Science, University of Maryland, in Science Digest (April 1983)\nCross-national comparisons of recent rates of population growth and economic growth show a lack of negative impact of population growth on living standards in the long run. More generally, in less developed countries per capita income has been growing as fast as or faster than in the developed countries, according to a World Bank survey for the years 1950 to 1975, despite the fact that population has grown faster in developing countries than in developed countries. Zhao Ziyang Premier of China, in a 1982 report to the National People's Congress\nWe must take effective measures and encourage late marriage, advocate one child for each couple, strictly control second births and resolutely prevent additional births so as to control population growth. Otherwise, the execution of our national economic plan and the improvement of the people's living standards will be adversely effected. Persuasive education must be conducted among the people of the whole country, especially among the peasants, to change radically the feudal attitude of viewing sons as better than daughters and regarding more sons as a sign of good fortune. We must, in particular, protect infant girls and their mothers. The whole society should resolutely condemn the criminal activities of female infanticide and maltreatment of the mothers, and the judicial departments should resolutely punish the offenders according to law. Clare Boothe Luce Member of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, in a 1982 interview\nThere's no record in history of a nation continuing to grow in power and prestige with a declining birth rate.

    "text": "3d World's Food Needs Seen Growing by U.S.\n1984-06-10T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Agriculture Department said today that third-world countries would have to import 31 million tons of food next year, a rise of 3 percent, simply to keep hunger in check at a level far below accepted nutrition needs.\nWhile rising production in some countries, notably India, has made the third world more self-sufficient, drought and poverty are forcing southern Africa to rely on charity for two- thirds of its import needs, the department said in a report.\nDeveloping countries in 1985 will have to count on aid for 38 percent of the food needed to keep nutrition levels at their current modest levels, the agency said. Bangladesh, Nepal, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Kenya, Zaire, Bolivia and Peru are among the neediest nations, the report noted.\nA major factor in whether United States production will reach third- world markets is the level of food assistance. The Food for Peace program is budgeted at $1.5 billion this year. The House this week passed an appropriations bill that sets next year's food aid slightly higher, at $1.6 billion.",

    "text": "FOOD NOTES\n1984-09-26T05:00:00.000Z\nFor Local Mycologists\nEdible wild mushrooms are abundant at this time of year, with many city specialty food shops carrying several varieties, most of them from the West Coast, Canada or Europe. There are also good supplies of edible local mushrooms for foragers who know where to look and what to pick to put in the pot. For those who feel timid about approaching such a potentially hazardous diversion the Queens Botanical Garden in Flushing is offering help.\nOn Oct. 7 members of the Long Island Mycological Society will be on hand at the Botanical Garden from 2 to 4 P.M. to identify mushrooms found by uncertain foragers and show how to distinguish the edible from the poisonous.\nThe identification session, which is free, will be followed by an indoor slide lecture on the more than 200 varieties of wild mushrooms that grow in the New York area.,The lecture will cost $1.50 for nonmembers of the Botanical Garden but is free for members.\nThe Queens Botanical Garden is at 43-50 Main Street, Flushing, a few blocks from the Main Street stop on the IRT No. 7 train.\nBasis of the Market BasketMarket-basket surveys are published every four weeks by the municipal Department of Consumer Affairs. The latest one, which will be issued Friday, will show a slight decline in food prices for the period ending Sept. 7 as against the previous four-week period.\nThe surveys determine the average cost of 41 items purchased in 150 retail stores in the city. The items are selected from six basic groups: grains and grain products (cereals, flour, rice); meat and fish; dairy products; fresh fruit and vegetables; processed fruit and vegetables, and beverages - in effect the weekly nutritional requirements of a family of two adults and two children.\nThe stores represent a cross section of ethnic neighborhoods. According to Gary Walker of the consumer agency, they include ''supermarkets, mom- and-pop-type neighborhood stores and specialty stores such as butcher shops.'' Two full-time people collect the information, which is fed into a computer that averages the individual prices and calculates the total.\nThe current four-week total, $114.41, is $4.63, or 4.2 percent, higher than in the comparable period a year ago. ''Teabags are 14 cents higher for a package of 48 than they were last year,'' Mr. Walker said. ''I really can't tell you why.''\nHe said the price of potatoes had dropped substantially, reflecting the arrival of ample supplies from Long Island. He said the price would probably continue to decline for awhile.\nThe market-basket report is part of ''Food and Energy Cost Update,'' which also includes information on home energy costs and the price of gasoline in the city.\nConsumers who wish to receive copies of the report on a regular basis should write to the Department of Consumer Affairs, Public Information Division, 80 Lafayette Street, New York, N.Y. 10013.\nEthnic Fare Downtown\nFor more than a hundred years the Lower East Side has been one of the great focal points for immigration into New York City and the rest of the nation. Early in the century the area was the heart of a thriving community of Eastern European Jews. These days it has become home to Indians and Bangladeshis, Poles and Russians, and Hispanics from Puerto Rico, Cuba and the Dominican Republic, all of whom have arrived since the 1960's.\n''Immigrants are part of what makes New York City so great,'' said Lyn Tiefenbacher, an anthropologist and the curator of an exhibition called ''What's Cooking?'' that depicts restaurant culture on the Lower East Side. A multimedia show presented by the Community Documentation Workshop of St. Mark's Church in the Bowery and the New York Folklore Society, it will be on view at the church from Sunday through December.\nMiss Tiefenbacher helped organize a three-day conference this weekend to coincide with the show's opening. ''Most of the research that's been done,'' she said, ''has been on folk life and food ways in private settings. People are only now beginning to look at what happens when the domestic food scene goes public.''\n''We're going to look at the ways restaurants in the Lower East Side serve the general public of the city as a whole as well as the immigrant population,'' she went on. ''There's a need for these family-run restaurants in New York City. For immigrants it's a way into the American economy that's not displacing anyone.''\nAt the same time, she added, they function as social clubs and as a means of ''chain migration,'' linking those who have recently arrived and those who have become established. ''We're dealing with a lot of restaurants people don't even know about,'' she said.\nThe conference and exhibition will open Friday evening. The Saturday schedule includes a daylong series of 10-to-15-minute slide presentations on such topics as eating, immigrant life and restaurants. On Sunday morning James P. Shenton, professor of American history at Columbia University, will lead a walking tour of Chinese, Jewish, Italian and Indian- Bangladeshi restaurants in the area. Sunday afternoon will be devoted to documentary films.\nTo register for the conference send $10 to the Community Documentation Workshop, St. Mark's Church, Second Avenue and 10th Street, New York, N.Y. 10003. The cost includes Saturday lunch. Indicate whether you want Spanish or Indian-Bangladeshi (vegetarian). The Sunday tour will meet at 10 A.M. at Chatham Square; a contribution of $5 is requested. The film festival begins at 1 P.M. Sunday in St. Mark's Church; a contribution of $3 is requested.\nThe public can join the walking tour or the film festival without attending the conference.\nBefore the FrostThe frost is on the pumpkin, metaphorically speaking at least. Autumn arrived Saturday, and as if in recognition the Greenmarkets are full of bright pumpkins. If you feel, as many do, that pumpkin pie is one of the great overrated achievements of American cuisine, you have probably never had it made with the fresh fruit, lightly steamed, pureed, blended with eggs and cream, and gently spiced with cloves, mace and a scraping of nutmeg. Warm from the oven and topped with a dash of vanilla ice cream, it is a superb finish to a fall meal. BUY OF THE WEEK BUTTERNUT AND ACORN SQUASH",

    "text": "IN INDIA'S NORTHEAST: THE TAMING OF THE GUERRILLA\n1984-03-13T05:00:00.000Z\nParamilitary troops armed with automatic weapons and equipped with radios continuously patrol the streets of this capital of the northeastern frontier state of Manipur, searching for insurgents fighting for independence from India. Posters of ''wanted criminals'' with photos and rewards are plastered at street corners, bringing to mind Hollywood westerns.\nIn daylight hours, despite the visible presence of security forces, Imphal resembles any town in Southeast Asia with its narrow, crowded streets, thousands of cyclists and rickety buses. Its inhabitants have the high cheekbones and other physical characteristics of the people of India's northeast as well as Southeast Asia.\nBut after dark the town's roads are empty except for troop patrols and cars of officials who travel with heavily armed escorts. Some hotels lock and bar their entrances by 8:30 P.M.; frequent power failures add to a palpable, simmering tension. For the focus of the northeastern insurgencies that began in neighboring Nagaland nearly 30 years ago has shifted to Manipur and Tripura states after enveloping nearby Mizoram in the 1960's and 1970's. Armed Forays and Ambushes\nAlthough the hills of Nagaland and Mizoram, where some say thousands died during fierce fighting, are quiet today, the rebellions have not been totally vanquished by Indian military might. The rebels have retreated and shifted their bases into Burma and Bangladesh and occasionally conduct armed forays into India.\nThe insurgencies in Manipur and Tripura take the form of occasional ambushes of Indian troops, bank robberies and political assassinations, such as that of a former state chief minister who was gunned down here Jan. 30. Rebels also extort money and food from villagers near the border.\nExperts on the area believe that Manipur and, to a lesser extent, Tripura, which borders on Assam and Bangladesh, have been picked for new insurgency operations because separatist movements in both states began only recently, in 1976 and 1980, while Nagaland and Mizoram have wearied of decades of bloodshed.\nThe most active insurgent group in Manipur is the National Socialist Council of Nagaland, which has major bases just across from the state in Burma, in the Somai tract, and another opposite Tirap district in India's Arunachal Pradesh. Nagas have lived for centuries not only in what is now Nagaland and Manipur but also in Burma. Development and Rehabilitation\nIn an attempt to blunt popular hostility, the Indian Government has over the years pumped huge amounts of money into an economic development program for the northeast and offered rehabilitation programs to rebels wishing to surrender. The programs have worked in Nagaland and Mizoram, but not that extensively in Manipur and Tripura.\nThe visible economic development and apparent peace in Nagaland and Mizoram have not changed the convictions of many tribespeople there, who consider themselves different from Indians because of their traditions and racial and religious practices. The tribespeople are predominantly Christian, while an overwhelming majority of Indians are Hindu.\nBut hundreds of guerrilla fighters, weary of the hard life in the jungle and of being hunted by Indian troops, have surrendered to the authorities. With official help, many are now prosperous businessmen. Some are politicians in local units of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's Congress Party, representing the very regime they once opposed so bitterly. A few are even Cabinet ministers and legislators in Nagaland and Mizoram.\nFormer guerrilla leaders walk freely on the steep roads of Aijal, capital of Mizoram. ''I am proud of being a former fighter for Mizoram,'' said Lal Thawnvunga, 40 years old, the former finance secretary of the Mizo National Front, who is now editor of a local newspaper. 'No Question of Wavering'\nBut others are more defiant. ''It is absolutely clear in our hearts that we were never part of the Indian union and will never be,'' said Sebie Dolie, a Naga farmer who is a cousin of Angami Zapu Phizo, the leader of a rebel Naga faction, the Federal Republic of Nagaland, who lives in exile in London.\n''There is no question of wavering,'' Mr. Dolie added at his home in Khonoma village. He said seven of his cousins had died fighting for independence. ''Those who are alive cannot betray the dead,'' he said.\nYet despite the tough words of Mr. Phizo's followers, the Government has successfully held elections for local legislatures and the national Parliament in all insurgency-hit areas for more than 30 years. Officials say an increasing number of people are taking part in the political system and benefiting from economic development plans, dulling the desire for independence. About 3,000 to 3,500 rebels are thought to be still active.\nViolent conditions existed throughout the entire 500-mile belt of jungle, mountains and valleys on the eastern edge of Assam until the insurgencies began to wane after the mid-1970's, when the Nagas and Mizos signed separate peace accords with New Delhi.\nThe roots of the various insurgencies are different, although a common strand - threatened racial identity - runs through the four separatist movements of Nagaland, Mizoram, Manipur and Tripura.\nThere is, however, limited cooperation among the major groups. An Alliance Based in Bangladesh\nThe Mizo National Front, whose number is officially estimated at 400, has reportedly allied with the smaller National Volunteer Force of Tripura state. Both groups are based in Bangladesh. The Tripura force, active for about four years, recently killed five policemen in an ambush.\nThe major Naga guerrilla group is the National Socialist Council of Nagaland, which is helping the People's Liberation Army of Manipur. The council is said to have the largest rebel army, estimated at more than 2,000, based in Burma. The People's Liberation Army of Manipur is said to have about 100 young Manipuris, aged between 15 and 30, also in Burma.\nIn Manipur the People's Liberation Army rebels are members of the plains-dwelling Meithei community who are predominantly Hindu. The movement began as a backlash against large-scale official corruption and a militant affirmation of Meithei identity, which is based on animism, and a rejection of Hindu values.\nThe northeastern region is difficult to reach; it is poorly connected by air, bus services are irregular and often break down, and roads are bumpy. Foreign nationals are barred from visiting the area and even Indians must get special permission to travel to what are stil described as ''restricted areas.''\nNowhere perhaps is the separatist view more strident than among the Nagaland students federation in Kohima, capital of Nagaland. The students speak openly of plans to raise the flag of the Burma-based Federal Republic of Nagaland on ''Naga republic day'' at the end of March.\nThe Chief Minister of Nagaland, S. C. Jamir, indicated in an interview that he regarded the students as misguided enthusiasts. ''There is no trouble now and time is a great healer,'' he said.",

    "text": "IN SHORT\n1984-11-11T05:00:00.000Z\nFICTIONONE THING LEADING TO ANOTHER: And Other Stories. By Sylvia Townsend Warner. Selected and edited by Susanna Pinney. (Viking, $14.95.) In this posthumous collection of stories, fey mortals and all-too-mortal fairies abound. Of the 20 pieces - several of which appeared in The New Yorker over the past 40 years - most concern themselves with the real world; the rest take place in the imaginary, politically sensitive Kingdoms of Elfin. Whether writing naturalistically about village life in England, or fantastically about the destinies of elves, Sylvia Townsend Warner (who wrote in a wide variety of genres, including poetry) works her curious trick of showing how one thing does indeed lead to another, often in the most alarming way. ''Some Effects of a Hat'' is typical: an American tourist leaves his homburg behind in a chance encounter with an unmarried, unpopular woman living in Devonshire. Expecting him to come back for it and unwilling to let the expensive hat sink into the oblivion of daily neglect like ''the inexplicable key on the bathroom window sill, the dog-eared packet of wallflower seed behind the parlour clock,'' the woman keeps it spruced and ready on the table near her front door. Her hostile neighbors get suspicious of a man's hat (''It's been moved a good inch to the right since I saw it last Tuesday''), and she is eventually driven out of town, only to end up in Derbyshire and a new life. Warner's effects are especially delightful when characters appear in several stories.\nAmong the most charming of these are the members of the Finch family. Puzzlement is the ground of their being - for Mrs. Finch, because she's lost her train of thought, or her gloves; for Mr. Finch and the children, because of Mrs. Finch. Though Warner's greatest gifts are comic, two or three stories expose a dark side of English life, the casualties of war or poverty. Her darker and brighter purposes combine most successfully in ''The Proper Circumstances,'' which chronicles the narrator's experience with a mother and daughter whom she has taken in after their own home has been fire-bombed during World War II. Here, as in all these remarkable stories, Warner particularizes the indiscriminate tidal wave of life so that if one thing is lost, there are others that survive.- Nancy Forbes\n* RIDE A PALE HORSE.\nDefinition of a thriller - a book that can't be put down until the climactic finish. But five minutes later, even under withering cross- examination, it would be impossible to name the protagonist whose exploits you'd followed breathlessly. A case in point is Helen MacInnes's 21st novel, ''Ride a Pale Horse,'' which contains enough red herring to make a large salad. Karen Cornell, an attractive, brainy journalist covering a peace gathering in Prague, is approached by a Czech official who announces his plans to defect, hints that there may be a Soviet mole in United States Intelligence, and then presents her with three cleverly forged letters. Their publication, he assures Karen, ''could start a major upheaval - riots, wild protests, an end to the Western alliance. . . . A hideous war.'' Ever the ambitious reporter, Karen knows she has the makings of a great story - if she isn't murdered by the K.G.B. before she gets to her typewriter. Back in Washington, she enlists the aid of Peter Bristow, a C.I.A. agent who is a specialist in the technique of ''disinformation.'' The two set out to unravel a deadly puzzle, falling in love, of course, along the way. There is no question that Miss MacInnes keeps the pages turning but the denouement is something of a letdown after all that has come before. Also, there might have been more attention to detail. In one instance, Peter's boss, Menlo, observes to himself ''that love and danger didn't mix. Emotional involvement could blunt a man's judgment.'' Several pages later, Miss MacInnes has Peter thinking ''Menlo was right. . . . Love and danger don't mix, make a man forgetful.'' The author seems to be the forgetful one here. Or are we to believe that in addition to his keen wit, ''well-proportioned body and good profile,'' Peter Bristow is also telepathic? - Joanne Kaufman\n* COLD SASSY TREE.\nThis novel is a sort of period piece set in the small Georgia town of Cold Sassy in 1906. Essentially, it is the story of young Will Tweedy's coming of age. As the narrator, Will is the pivotal character who links and brings into focus other characters' reactions to the theatrical May-September marriage of Miss Love Simpson and Grandpa Blakeslee, who wed three weeks after Grandma Blakeslee dies. Miss Love is a young milliner, and her marriage to Grandpa, who owns the town store and is idolized by Will, naturally scandalizes kith and kin. Olive Ann Burns has cast her narrative in a dialect voice, which is always a gamble. Southern patois can be rendered in stark poetry, as in Alice Walker's ''The Color Purple,'' or refashioned into lush Biblical cadences as in the better William Faulkner novels, but ''Cold Sassy Tree'' sticks straight to the phrasings of unimaginative small-town folk. Will says ''would of'' endlessly, and his dialect matches that of the other characters with unadorned consistency. The result is a narrative riddled with cliches - ineffectively so, since by now, primarily because of television, even most Yankees know how these people talk. Although the black people in the novel are not stereotypes, most of them are happy and content with their lot - and some of them are simply preposterous. As Grandma lays dying, Queenie the cook splatters tears on hot grease. ''Then she went to singing the African grief song her daddy learned in Nigeria before he got lured onto a slave ship.'' If that statement did not betray a questionable historical sense (usually slaves were not ''lured'' onto ships, they were captured, and it would have been odd for a grief song to survive the systematic eradication of tribal memory), it would make Queenie potentially the most interesting character in the book. To her credit, the author effectively conveys the world view of an adolescent boy; the portrait of Grandpa and Miss Love is the best writing in the book. - Jason Berry\n* THE MAN WHO STOLE THE MONA LISA.\nThe ghost of J. P. Morgan must be getting weary from all the recent summoning forth. Not so long ago, there was E. L. Doctorow's evocation of the great megabuck spirit in his novel ''Ragtime,'' and now there's Martin Page's ''The Man Who Stole the Mona Lisa.'' Being the richest man in the world, with an ego to match, J. P. Morgan can't abide the idea of the greatest art treasure in the world hanging stagnant in a mere museum. He must have it for his very own, and his desire is so intense that it transmits to the elite of art thieves, supreme among whom is Adam Worth, ne Litvak. Worth's reputation is legendary, and it is demonstrated to the irascible billionaire by the manner in which he arranges their meeting. J. P. wants the Mona Lisa and Adam Worth says he can get it out of the Louvre for him. The Big Man wants to know what that little caper will cost; a cool five million, Worth tells him. After some haggling, Worth gets the commission. Five million, incidentally, is what the real J. P. offered the French government for the painting. He was refused, of course, but the tender sets up a nice choice as to who has the greater chutzpah, Morgan or Worth. Part of Worth's particular genius is his protean ability to change his appearance so thoroughly that even his wife can't recognize him - that is, any one of the four discarded wives he's collected during his operations. It seems he marries different women in different countries, arranging the demise of his last persona to accommodate his latest wife. This is the kind of novel that will grab those who went bonkers over Rubic's Cube. There are endless twists and turns, in this case offering fascinating arcana about old paintings and new heists. The question is, how much does one want to know? Some will undoubtedly find fun following the labyrinthine plot; others, for want of some credible characters, may find the going tedious. - Seymour Epstein\n* GREENHOUSE: It Will Happen in 1997. By Dakota James. (Donald I. Fine, $15.50.) When Orwell imagined Big Brother's dreadful Oceania in ''Nineteen Eighty- Four,'' readers could hope, ''It can't happen here.'' But in Dakota James's first novel, ''Greenhouse,'' the America of 1997 sounds all too horribly possible. Cities rot, trash piles up, jobs disappear, atomic wastes get buried under housing tracts, strip-mined national parks are converted to Moonscape Wonder resorts and carbon dioxide pollution has passed the tip-over point. Those who said the world would end by ice are swelteringly wrong - the South is a desert, retired Floridians have run with their golf clubs to the Yukon and West Antarctica has melted, flooding Bangladesh. In Chicago, where it's 100 degrees in the winter shade, Casper Spent, assistant professor of philosophy, is denied tenure because of his resistance to the postmodern high- tech society championed by his dean. Spent's public references to his college, F.S.U. (where drugged illiterates win scholarships by reciting ''Puke Rock'' lyrics), as a ''miserable populist dump'' and his interminable letters and poems to the dean (''I twist and ache in a world grown hideous as a tumor'') make him the prime suspect when the school's audio-visual equipment is vandalized, ''forcing the students to read.'' The antidote for Spent's despair is drink and flights of prose in a journal quoted at length. ''The day drags like a mephitic slug across a sticky plank.'' Edenic hope blooms briefly with awakening love but after vigilantes burn the house Spent has built for his dimwitted cocktail waitress bride, Angst returns to his journal. ''Greenhouse'' has a fine feel for the comic ridicule on which satire depends, and, heaven knows, its cri de coeur about our pollution of our land, sky, art and minds is well meant and much needed. The problem is that the author neither detaches himself from Spent (seeing his folly), nor absorbs him (dramatizing his heroism), so that the book veers from the farcical to the polemical, sometimes sounding like Terry Southern, sometimes like the Sierra Club. Mr. James doesn't dig deep enough to make us feel the horror and to shout with Spent, ''I refuse!'' - Michael Malone\nNONFICTIONTHE SWEEPS: Behind the Scenes in Network TV.\nOne way to get a handle on the sprawling creature called television is to treat the entire industry as if it were a situation comedy. In ''The Sweeps,'' Mark Christensen and Cameron Stauth, both magazine writers, survey the 1983-84 season of weekly series with enough zingy one-liners to keep ''The Love Boat'' (one of their least favorite shows) afloat for another decade. They focus on the schedule of NBC because, as current mythology would have it, its chairman, Grant Tinker, is especially dedicated to quality programs (including ''Hill Street Blues'' and ''Cheers,'' both made by MTM Enterprises, the company Mr. Tinker founded). Unfortunately, the 1983-84 season did little or nothing to buttress Mr. Tinker's reputation for quality. The more ambitious weekly candidates such as ''Bay City Blues,'' which featured a baseball player with bed-wetting problems, and ''Mr. Smith,'' all about an orangutan going to Washington, were merely dopey. NBC quickly began to look with renewed respect at its successful, mindless ''The A-Team.'' Nevertheless, the authors manage to provide hilarious, even if unsettling, glimpses into television decision making and production. In fact, the more offbeat and outrageous the people involved, the more the authors appreciate them. The book's heroes include a fiercely ambitious dwarf actor, a magician- comedian seeking security in a new sitcom and an edgy writer trying to sell a script titled ''The Hunchback of UCLA.'' The authors imply that if these and similar talents were unleashed or at least financed, television would be a thing of joy forever. But the ''Hunchback'' writer seems closer to the mark when he notes how television already provides very well-paid work for people who probably couldn't fit in anywhere else. ''I mean,'' he asks, ''can you imagine Mr. T making a living selling Chevies?'' - John J. O'Connor\n* STYLE VERSUS SUBSTANCE: Boston, Kevin White, and the Politics of Illusion.\nIn the meandering ''Style Versus Substance,'' George V. Higgins presents a provocative thesis: The Boston Globe first made Kevin White mayor of Boston in 1967, then in 1983 decided he had to go. The Globe, Mr. Higgins says, picked Mr. White not so much because its editors liked him but because they disliked his principal opponent, Louise Day Hicks, and her racial code messages about the sanctity of neighborhood schools. In Mr. Higgins's analysis, Mrs. Hicks's populist, polarizing candidacy was judged bad for the banks, real estate developers and other business interests The Globe served. Then, after Mr. White had run the city for 16 years, The Globe magisterially decided it wanted him out and hounded him with corruption charges until he decided against a running for a fifth term. For Mr. Higgins, the paper's motive was no nobler in 1983 than in 1967 - this time The Globe acted because it was being challenged on its own turf by The New York Times. ''The Times notice of competition in the local market,'' he writes, ''prompted The Globe to air out its drawers of long undisturbed linens.'' Among that linen, Mr. Higgins says, was Mr. White's close relationship with developers. This is potent stuff - Mayor White and the Beacon Hill elites acting like the lowlifes in Mr. Higgins's novel ''The Friends of Eddie Coyle.'' But Mr. Higgins leaves too much out. He overlooks the possibilities that Mr. White was the best candidate in 1967 and did a reasonably good job. It's also possible that by 1983 Mr. White's effectiveness had eroded and the voters knew it. Mr. Higgins seems to have an overblown view of the power of the press. Do newspapers and television news really tell people what to think? Did the media get the Mayor? Mr. Higgins says yes but does not prove it. And although he writes a column for The Globe, he doesn't include interviews with any of the paper's staff members, confining his research to the newspaper's clips. In the end, Mr. Higgins, who writes with flair, is guilty of the charge he levels against Mr. White and The Globe (when it supported him) - elevating style over substance. - Edwin Diamond\n* SCOTTO: More Than a Diva.\nSmart, tough and, when she had to be, mean, Renata Scotto used a piercingly accurate soprano voice and a fierce sense of dramatic characterization to build her career in opera. She was born in 1934 in Savona, Italy, to a policeman and a seamstress and spent much of her childhood avoiding World War II's armies of invasion. Early in her professional life, she showed the courage to quit secondary roles at La Scala in favor of leading ones in the provinces. And when wider recognition finally came, she never hesitated to tell off La Scala or the Metropolitan Opera when they failed to give her the productions she needed to push herself onward. In ''Scotto,'' written with Octavio Roca, a former music critic for The Washington Post, she recounts her triumphs with relish but faces her disastrous opening-night ''Norma'' at the Met three years ago with characteristic fortitude. The publicized run-ins with Maria Callas, she says, are journalistic fiction, and she lovingly celebrates Callas and other colleagues (James Levine, Alfredo Kraus, John Dexter, Riccardo Muti, Placido Domingo). Miss Scotto saves her spleen for Giuseppe Di Stefano (he once left her on stage to eat an apple in the wings) and Richard Tucker (he once removed his false teeth during ''Lucia di Lammermoor''). But it takes Luciano Pavarotti to make Miss Scotto really lose her temper. Never mentioning him by name, she recounts her 1976 squabble with him over curtain calls at the San Francisco Opera, and she questions the tenor's intelligence, zeal for preparation and musical literacy. Beyond the gossip, however, are Miss Scotto's valuable explanations of her dramatic principles. Hers has not been one of the sumptuous soprano sounds of our time, but her renderings of Norma, Cio- Cio-San and Violetta have forced a generation of fans to rethink opera's dramatic possibilities. - Bernard Holland\n* HACKERS: Heroes of the Computer Revolution.\nThese ''heroes'' are three generations of computer programmers whose single-mindedness Steven Levy, a journalist, attempts to explain in ''Hackers.'' First there was the pioneering generation of M.I.T. students and hangers-on who worked on artificial intelligence during the late 1950's and 60's and were driven only by their own intellectual curiosity and obsessive love of programming for its own sake. The ''hacker ethic,'' as described by Mr. Levy, condemned anything that came between the user and the machine (such as the bureaucracies that had grown up at M.I.T. around the giant I.B.M. computers). Instead, it promoted a democracy of talent (open even to high school students with the requisite skills) and the free exchange of ideas as hackers vied to improve on one another's programs. Many of these values carried over to the second generation of ''hardware hackers'' from northern California. Their rabid interest in their homemade machines led to the explosive development of the personal-computer industry. To their surprise, they found themselves transformed from hobbyists into moguls and the employers of yet another generation of programmers, many of whom would become highly paid stars in their own right as designers of computer games. As personal computers became big business, the hacker ethic went the way of the dinosaur: software became something to copyright rather than share. Mr. Levy's story is engaging, but he lacks the skill to make the many programmers he interviewed come alive as individuals. And he has not pared down his mass of anecdotal material to manageable proportions. ''Hackers'' reads like a monstrously overblown magazine article written in chatty, fragmented prose. - Anita Susan Grossman\n* THE NUCLEAR CRISIS READER. Edited by Gwyn Prins. (Vintage, Paper, $6.95.) This collection of 16 essays is largely the product of one of those gatherings of concerned people - academics, public policy men and recent members of the circles of power - held to discuss ''alternative strategies'' in a time of a ''breaking of consensus.'' Most of the contributors attended the seminar, at Cambridge University last year; all deploy analyses from seasoned experience to prove an ultimate case that is more usually advanced by the passions of prophets in the wilderness. As the book's editor, Gwyn Prins, a historian, puts it: in the long run surely and in the short run quite possibly, ''the nuclear weapon is the enemy of security.'' There are rough-hewn combat prognoses (pyschological as well as strategic) by retired military officers of high rank, polished summaries of the history of and the possibilities for negotiation by eminent diplomatic and national-security figures and perfectly formulated moral arguments by philosophers and international lawyers. There are also disagreements - about the value of deterrence, the virtues of beefing up conventional military capability, the way to take the first steps in de-escalating the arms race (to say nothing of how far to go) and NATO's current role (which brought the group together in the first place). But there is no division on the dangers of superpower bellicosity, the risks of nuclear proliferation and the near certainty of Armageddon if a single nuclear weapon is used. Will true believers in postwar geopolitical and nuclear doctrine come away still saying, ''Yes, but . . .''? Probably. Some, however, might be swayed by Adm. Noel Gayler, U.S.N., retired, to recognize that ''the Soviets are the focus of some evil, to be sure, but 'all evil' is a bit of an overstatement.'' - Caroline Rand Herron\nArt and Advertising Herbert Bayer's Surrealist posters, magazine covers and lower-case alphabets are considered pivotal achievements in redirecting modern graphic design. As a leading innovator at the Bauhaus, he was instrumental in establishing experimental typography and photomontage. While other avant- garde artists at the beginning of the century returned to painting and architecture after exploring typography and illustration, Mr. Bayer proceeded to incorporate revolutionary graphic principles into the world of advertising. Although Mr. Bayer is best known for his contribution to graphic design, Arthur A. Cohen, a novelist and essayist, devotes more than half of HERBERT BAYER: The Complete Work (MIT, $50; $65 after Dec. 31) to his 60-year career as a painter and sculptor. Mr. Cohen's shorter essays discuss Mr. Bayer's creative principles and their relation to graphic design, photography and architecture. This is as much Mr. Bayer's book as it is Mr. Cohen's. Mr. Bayer, who served the book's art director, not only presents a wealth of unpublished visual material from his own archive but also provides a cogent selection of his own essays. Whereas Mr. Bayer's 1967 ''Herbert Bayer: Painter, Designer, Architect'' documented his pioneering work in graphic design, Mr. Cohen's book reveals the underpinnings of Mr. Bayer's esthetic. The clarity and constraint that characterize the design of the book are a celebration of Mr. Bayer's ideals, as are Mr. Cohen's laudatory essays. However, by concentrating on Mr. Bayer as a painter-artist, the book neglects to appraise his lasting contribution to modern graphic design. - Sarah Bodine",

    "text": "U.S. WEIGHING ROLE IN U.N. FARM UNIT\n1984-01-22T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Reagan Administration is considering ending United States participation in a small, specialized United Nations organization based in Rome that assists small farmers and landless laborers in the poorest countries.\nThe issue is being discussed at a time when the Administration is taking a hard look at all 120 international organizations in which the United States holds membership.\nThe current question involves the International Fund for Agricultural Development. According to Administration officials from several departments, President Reagan has been called on to resolve a dispute over participation in the agency, which is encountering financial problems.\nThe conflict is chiefly between Agriculture Secretary John R. Block, who is pressing for a continued American commitment, and officials in the Treasury Department and the Office of Management and Budget, who are opposed because of United States budget problems and what they see as a duplication of efforts with other agencies that lend money to poor countries. The Unesco Decision\nThe new retrenchment is being considered less than a month after the United States announced its intention to withdraw from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization at the end of 1984 unless Unesco alters practices that the Administration found objectionable. The United States has long criticized what it says is the politicization of Unesco and has objected to spending policies and budget increases.\nState Department officials say there is no general policy to retreat from international organizations. However, Gregory J. Newell, assistant secretary for international organization affairs, acknowledged at a news conference late last month that the Administration had had problems with a number of agencies in addition to Unesco because of politicization, budget and management policies.\nThese include the International Labor Organization, the United Nations Environmental Program, the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the International Telecommunications Union.\nThe Reagan Administration has also cut by 25 percent its commitment to an agency of the World Bank, the International Development Association, which makes development loans to the poorest countries. A Conference in Rome\nThe International Fund for Agricultural Development, which has 139 members, grew out of the World Food Conference in Rome 10 years ago, when major nations were considering ways to deal with spreading famine and malnutrition in the third world.\nIn the six years that it has operated, it has committed about $1.8 billion for 138 projects aiding the rural poor in 77 countries, according to its President, Abdelmuhsin al-Sudeary, who is from Saudi Arabia.\nThe agency, which makes loans for such purposes as the purchase of milk cows or materials for basketweaving in Bangladesh, is managed by an executive board with six members from developing countries, six from industrial countries and six from members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Financing has been shared almost equally between OPEC and the industrial countries.\nBut the agency is now running out of money to commit for new projects. The membership is scheduled to meet in Rome Feb. 29 to March 1 to consider a new multiyear financial pledges. Opposed to Participation\nOfficials opposed to continued participation in the agency include Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan and David A. Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget. They cite the need for fiscal restraint by the United States and their perception that the agency's work duplicates that of such other organizations as the World Bank, which makes third world development loans, and the United Nations Development Program, which provides technical assistance.\nMr. Block contends that the agriculture agency complements the work of other institutions.\nOther countries, especially the Scandinavian countries and Canada, have been especially vocal in their support of the agency.\nAt a meeting of the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization in Rome last November, the United States was under strong criticism for not meeting its full financial pledge to the agency. For the years 1981 through 1983, the United States said it would put up $180 million. The total pledges of 20 industrialized countries and 12 OPEC members were $1.05 billion for the period.\nEven though the pledges were supposed to have been paid by last Dec. 31, the United States still owes $90 million. More than $100 million is also owed by other donors.\nThe United States has said it will clear up its arrears but has not said when. Other countries have made similar promises.\nLibya, for example, has said that its $31 million arrearage would be cleared up shortly. Saudi Arabia owes $51 million and Nigeria $26 million, and both have also said the arrearage would be paid. Iran owes its full commitment of $19 million and has said nothing.",

    "text": "TECHNICAL AID FOR WORLD'S FARMERS\n1984-03-08T05:00:00.000Z\nMillicent Fenwick, the American representative at the four United Nations agencies based in Rome, likes to give a small example of how aid to the poor can be effective.\nIn Bangladesh, Mrs. Fenwick said in an interview, a group of 20 poor women were given a loan of $170 by the International Fund for Agricultural Development. The women used the money to buy cows to start a small dairy business and put themselves on the road to modest economic well-being.\n''I think that IFAD, bar none, is one of the most hopeful agencies that we have,'' Mrs. Fenwick, a former New Jersey member of Congress, said. ''What does IFAD do? It is not handouts to alleviate suffering, it is attention paid to the poor and the landless.''\nBut in the fund's offices these days, there is a mood of considerable concern. The chief worry comes from a growing reluctance on the part of several member governments, pressed with budgetary problems of their own, to make substantial contributions. The United States, for example, has already failed to authorize $40 million of a $180 million pledge made during a conference in 1980 because, according to American officials, Congressional criticism of the fund made it unlikely that the money would be approved. End of U.S. Support Feared\nEarlier this year there were worries at the fund over reports that the United States was considering ending its contributions.\nAt a conference in February to plan for another replenishment of money for the organization, the Amerian delegation agreed that about $1 billion more was needed for the next three years. But a dispute has arisen between Western contributors and the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries over how much each group should contribute. American officials have said privately that if the OPEC countries refused to increase their share, United States participation could indeed be terminated.\n''The situation is very serious,'' Abdelmuhsin al-Sudeary of Saudi Arabia, the president of the fund, said in an interview here before the replenishment meeting. ''We reduced our lending this year, and if the replenishment is not finalized in the next few months, then we will not be able to have lending operations next year.'' Technical Assistance Provided\nThe four United Nations-related agencies based in Rome together spend some $2.3 billion a year in projects relating to agriculture. The parent agency is the Food and Agriculture Organization, which collects information about farming from its 152 member nations and gives technical assistance, mostly to developing countries.\nThe United States has over the years had its quarrels with what might be called the agricultural aid empire in Rome, particularly with the F.A.O.\nUnlike a number of other agencies in the United Nations system, the F.A.O. has rarely allowed politics to interfere in its work, Western diplomats and officials say. In part, perhaps, this is because most of the Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union, which are unwilling to provide the information on their agricultural systems required by the organization, are not members.\nStill, the United States has complained that the F.A.O. has failed to control its budget, has allowed its bureaucracy to become too large and has not provided enough information about how its money is being spent. In 1981 the United States and several other Western countries voted against approving the organization's budget. Improvement Reported\nSince then the situation seems to have improved, American officials say. The F.A.O.'s budget increase was held this year to less than 2 percent. Investigators from the State Department's Agency for International Development went to the organization to examine its programs and, American officials say, dissatisfaction diminished when more information was supplied about what the agency was doing.\nIt is clear, however, that the Reagan Administration is looking closely at the agricultural parts of the United Nations system and this has caused jitters within the Rome-based agencies. Some officials here believe the issue is not simply one of spending money, but of a philosophy of foreign aid as well. The belief is that the Administration, squeezed in its foreign aid programs by the huge Federal deficit, favors direct aid programs on the ground that they have greater political benefit.",

    "text": "GROUP CITES RIGHTS VIOLATIONS\n1984-10-24T05:00:00.000Z\nAmnesty International issued its annual report on human rights in 117 countries today and took note of what it said was a large number of people who have been attacked by their governments for calling attention to human rights abuses.\nThe activists, the report said, are only a handful among the thousands who have been tortured, kidnapped, killed or imprisoned in cages, malaria-infested ''re-education camps'' or psychiatric hospitals in the calendar year 1983, which the report details. But the few named, it said, ''must stand as symbols for the rest.''\nAmong those singled out by the organization, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977 , was America Yolanda Urizar, a Guatemalan labor lawyer abducted in March 1983 by heavily armed men, driven away in an army jeep and never seen again.\nAnother was Levko Lukyanenko, a Soviet lawyer who Amnesty said was serving his second 15-year sentence for trying to monitor his Government's compliance with human rights provisions of the 1975 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, Teacher Held in Benin\nAlso singled out was Paul Koudoukpo, a teacher who was said to have been arrested in Benin in 1982 and held since without trial on suspicion of distributing leaflets calling for the release of 35 students and teachers arrested from 1979 to 1981 after criticizing the Government's education policy.\nMilan Soklic, a sociology teacher, was sentenced to five years in prison in Yugoslavia for comparing capitalism favorably with Yugoslav socialism and complaining about restrictions on freedom of expression in the presence of several people at his home and in a hotel, the report said.\nSofya Belyak, a Roman Catholic Church organist from the Ukraine, was sentenced in October 1983 to five years in prison and five years of internal exile, according to the report, for circulating pamphlets on the reported appearance of the Virgin Mary at Fatima in Portugal in May 1917.\nLy Dai Nguyen, a Vietnamese writer and literary critic, the report said, has been detained for ''re-education'' for more than eight years without charge or trial. Illness in Vietnam Camps\nAmnesty International said it continued to receive reports that many detainees in the ''re-education'' camps in Vietnam, where 10,000 are believed held, were suffering from serious illnesses, including malaria, tuberculosis, heart ailments and malnutrition.\nThe report also noted the tendency to torture victims. In Bangladesh, it said, prisoners were beaten, whipped, hung upside down from the ceiling and shocked. In Iran, it said, the whipping was done with whips, cables, hosepipes and wooden strips bound with wire. To induce confessions, Amnesty said, relatives are also tortured.\nIn Guinea, where all political detainees were held incommunicado, detainees have been executed with the ''black diet,'' total deprivation of food and water, the report said. In Gabon, it said, prisoners are held in chains for long periods of time.\nIn Chile, the report said, hundreds have testified to beatings, shocks, and such public punishment as being made to run barefoot and sometimes naked in the street, sometimes on broken glass. In El Salvador, it said, Rafael Carias Flores, a teachers' union leader who was arrested in February 1981 and held without trial until his release in April 1983 was tortured with sulphuric acid.",

    "text": "WORLD POPULATION CRISIS...\n1984-05-08T05:00:00.000Z\nThere is some indication that Third World leaders are finally waking up to the fact that population growth is placing intolerable pressures on the earth's land, water and energy supplies. Among the first to reexamine population policies were the Chinese. After weighing a projected population growth of 300 to 400 million people against the future availability of cropland, water, energy and jobs, China's leaders concluded that they had no choice but to Lester R. Brown is president of the Worldwatch Institute and project director for the study ''State of the World - 1984,'' from which this article is adapted. press for one-child families, lest they jeopardize hard-earned gains in living standards. The main difference between China and other densely populated developing countries, such as Bangladesh, India, Egypt, Nigeria or Mexico, may be that the Chinese have had the foresight to make projections of their population and resources and the courage to translate their findings into policy. But other countries may also find that one-child families are the only humane alternative. Administering a one-child family program is not easy. To hold the line at one child, China relies on an established political structure extending down to the individual, strong peer pressure, substantial financial rewards for having only one child and hefty financial penalties for having more than one. Where a preference for sons is strong, the program is particularly difficult to enforce, as Chinese leaders can attest. And the line between peer pressure, in a society where citizen awareness of the population threat is high, and official coercion is a thin one.\nFor this reason, many societies regard government-sponsored, one- child family programs as infringements on reproductive freedom. But for many countries, the only alternative is a rate of population growth that undermines living conditions, an alternative that is all too visible in Africa, where population growth has outpaced food production for more than a decade and where starvation is becoming common.\nThe deterioration of the world economy lends fresh urgency to the need for new policies. Between 1950 and 1973, when world economic growth averaged 5 percent a year, the rising economic tide raised living standards throughout the world. Economic growth outpaced population growth almost everywhere. Average life expectancy in the Third World climbed from 43 to 53 years as nutrition and health improved.\nStarting in 1973, however, dramatic increases in oil prices narrowed the gap between economic growth and population growth. During the four years since the 1979 oil price hike, global economic growth has averaged 1.7 percent annually, exactly the same as population growth. A combination of higher energy prices, a broad deterioration of croplands and forests, a burdensome external debt in many Third World countries and the high interest rates now virtually assured by massive United States budget deficits suggests that the world economy will be hard pressed to expand by much more than 2 percent a year during the 1980's.\nFor countries that have reached zero population growth, such as West Germany, Belgium or Hungary, annual economic growth of 2 percent will still raise incomes a comfortable 2 percent each year. But for countries such as Kenya, Pakistan or Ecuador, whose populations expand at 3 percent or more per year, economic growth of 2 percent will yield a steady decline in income and living standards.\nMany countries are suffering from this imbalance in economic and population growth. The World Bank reports that in 18 countries, most of them in Africa, incomes fell during the 1970's. Other African countries have joined the list during the early years of this decade. The prospects are also discouraging in Latin America. The Inter- American Development Bank reports that per-capita income in 1983 was 10 percent below that of 1980. If rapid population growth continues, many Latin American countries burdened with external debt may finish the decade with incomes lower than those with which they started. One projection of Brazil's economic future anticipates that Brazil should be able to pay off its external debt but warns that austerity measures will keep its depressed industrial output below the 1980 level until 1990. By this time 37 million Brazilians will have been added to the 1980 population of 119 million, sharply reducing output per capita. The grim choices in Africa, where income decline is closely tied to the fall in per-capita food production, are belatedly coming into focus. Africa's overall food production growth of 2 percent a year remains quite respectable by international standards. But with a population growing at 3 percent annually, the fastest of any continent in history, Africa seems to face a steady decline in per capita output and a slow slide toward disaster.\nAs the outlines of the new economic era become more visible, population policy may come to command the time and attention of Third World political leaders as much as energy policy did in Western industrial capitals during the 1970's. In an age of slower economic growth, improvements in living standards may depend more on the skills of family planners than on those of economic planners.\nToo many governments have delayed facing the issue. When they do so, they may discover that they are forced to choose between a one-child family program or deteriorating living standards. Given the unprecedented numbers of young people who will reach reproductive age within the next two decades, a generation of one-child families may be the key to restoring a sustained improvement in living standards. In effect, this may be the price many societies will be forced to pay for neglecting population policy for too long.",

    "text": "ASSASSINATION IN INDIA: A LEADER OF WILL AND FORCE;\nINDIRA GANDHI, BORN TO POLITICS, LEFT HER OWN IMPRINT ON INDIA\n1984-11-01T05:00:00.000Z\nStrong-willed, autocratic and determined to govern an almost ungovernable nation that seemed always in strife, Indira Gandhi was Prime Minister four times and the dominant figure in India for almost two decades. \n She was born to politics and power, the granddaughter of Motilal Nehru, an early leader of the Indian independence movement, and daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, who led India as Prime Minister in its first 17 years of independence from Britain. \nMrs. Gandhi served as her widowed father's official hostess, and after she moved into the position he once held, she became, behind her father and Mohandas K. Gandhi, the most commanding figure in modern Indian history. She was often accused of trying to build an Indian dynasty by planning to have her son Sanjay succeed her, and after his death in a plane crash in 1980 she was said to be arranging for her other son, Rajiv, to fill her role. \nAs Prime Minister, Mrs. Gandhi presided over the world's most populous democracy, a nation of 700 million people. During her tenure the Government made limited headway against such age-old Indian problems as overpopulation, hunger, caste, inadequate sanitation and chronic religious strife among the majority Hindus, Moslems and other sects.\nHer years in power were turbulent, coming to a climax last June in a violent showdown with the minority Sikhs, when Mrs. Gandhi ordered Indian Army troops to attack the Golden Temple, the Sikhs' holiest place of worship, at Amritsar in the northern state of Punjab. \nA Decisive Leader \nBut until her assassination yesterday in New Delhi, Mrs. Gandhi served as a decisive - some said dictatorial - leader. \nShe led India into the nuclear age when, in 1974, scientists there exploded an underground nuclear device, and she also took her nation into the space age, in 1980, when it launched its own satellite on its own rocket. This year, through her efforts, an Indian astronaut flew in a Soviet spacecraft. \nIn 1971, Mrs. Gandhi insured that her nation would become the dominant power on the subcontinent when India defeated Pakistan in an 11- month war and insured the creation of Bangladesh from what had been East Pakistan. \nOn the international scene, relations with the United States, which provided billions of dollars in aid from the 1950's to the 1980's, were sour and tense during much of her tenure. Her overall foreign policy, she maintained, was not biased in one direction or another, only ''pro-Indian,'' and she was a leader of the group of nations professing nonalignment. Indian critics said, however, that she kept India locked into a rigid position, leaning toward Moscow to an extent that was clearly difficult and embarrassing during the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan. \nHer friendship with the Soviet Union enabled her Government to build a powerful, well-equipped army.\nIn Nehru's Shadow\nShe grew up in the shadow of her father and stunned almost everyone by her emergence as a tough, shrewd and ruthless woman of commanding presence and absolute will. She maintained for many years that power did not interest her.\n''I like being Prime Minister, yes, but not more than I liked the other jobs I have done in my life,'' she said in 1973. ''I am not ambitious. I don't care for honors.'' That was two years before she briskly assumed dictatorial powers, in response to what seemed a threat to her strength, and espoused the tenets of authoritarian rule, from suspension of civil liberties to censorship of the press. Then, demonstrating that India's familiar label as the world's largest democracy was not just a cliche, the voters of India swept her out of office and, 18 months later, voted her back into power again. \nHer critics charged that her promises to erase poverty were quixotic and that India's chronic and severe social problems actually burgeoned during her years of power. They said, too, that she tolerated corrupt ministers and fostered corruption in her younger son, Sanjay; that she was hungry for power and surrounded herself with inept advisers rather than brook potential rivals. Empty ''sloganizing'' and indecision, they said, had bred cynicism. \nReins of Autocracy \nUntil June 1975, it seemed that Mrs. Gandhi's central achievement was her adherence to cementing democracy - an achievement that ultimately ripped the reins of autocracy from her hands. She was successful in reasserting, sometimes forcefully, the dominance of the central Government over states that seemed to be squabbling perennially with each other. She also made clear her abhorrence of the religious tensions that continue in India. She repeatedly sought to blunt communalism in the nation and made clear her detestation of the Hindu nationalists who exploited anti-Moslem feelings.\nAs a private person, Mrs. Gandhi seemed aloof, chilly, complex, giving no clue in her withdrawn, quiet personality as to why her public figure should appeal as it did to many millions of Indians. She could be rude, sometimes opening letters and signing papers when foreigners visited her in the red sandstone Indian Parliament or the nearby South Block of the secretariat. \nIn 1967, for example, when Richard M. Nixon, then a private citizen, visited her in New Delhi, Mrs. Gandhi barely concealed her boredom, and after 20 minutes of chatting she asked the Foreign Ministry official escorting Mr. Nixon how much longer the visit would last. The question was in Hindi, but its purport was clear to Mr. Nixon. During interviews, she would sometimes simply ignore questions that she did not wish to answer, lapsing into silences, doodling on a notepad and smiling vaguely. \nAt other times, she gave the impression of shyness and vulnerability. She was physically frail. She had suffered from tuberculosis, low blood pressure, kidney problems and muscle spasms in the neck and had ignored doctors' orders not to have children. She worked 14 hours a day and seemed lonely and isolated.\n''I think the only reason I'm able to survive this with equanimity is that I'm just myself, regardless of the situation in the country,'' she once said. ''I know the condition of the people. There's nothing I can see that I don't know about already. It's not that you don't feel it, but - it's like a nurse and illness. You see it in perspective.''\n'A Certain Instinct' \nOne of the most detailed and widely discussed criticisms of Mrs. Gandhi in the years before her takeover of the Government came in 1974 from G. B. Verghese, a former press adviser to the Prime Minister and the widely respected editor of The Hindustan Times. Mr. Verghese called her ''strangely paralyzed, unwilling to lead, afraid of her own majority.''\n''The Prime Minister has no program, no world view, no grand design,'' he said. ''Thus, bereft of a frame, she has largely reacted to events and failed to shape them. This has been her tragedy. She lacks economic and administrative expertise. Nevertheless, she has a certain political instinct and charisma which would have been the greater assets if harnessed to a greater purpose. She has a mandate but no mission.''\nMrs. Gandhi herself often expressed her goals in sweeping and inoffensive terms: ''I am a politician in the sense that I want a particular kind of India, an India without poverty, without injustice, an India free of any foreign influence.'' Mr. Verghese and other critics said that, even backed with a great election victory and the success of the 1971 war with Pakistan, Mrs. Gandhi lacked specific goals.\nShe failed to define ''any larger, long-term objective of reconstructing India or the subcontinent,'' Mr. Verghese said. ''The greater the success, the greater the bewilderment over what to do. Having emblazoned 'Garibi Hatao' (Abolish Poverty) on her standard, she did not conceptualize it and carry it forward. She was quite unable to ride the crest of the wave.'' Nor, to be fair, had any of her critics had any greater success in meeting India's chronic crises or solving its perennial problems. \nUnconcealed Anger \nMrs. Gandhi did not conceal her anger at these attacks. ''This is one of the countries in the world where the economy, although under severe strain, is not collapsing,'' she said to a journalist in 1974. ''Do you think it is easy to keep a country like India united? You say promises are not kept. I assert with all authority: Who in the world has kept more promises?'' \nHowever vague her destinations may have seemed, Mrs. Gandhi was always clear about her conviction that she was meant to lead India. She rarely indulged in self-analysis and usually brushed aside questions about her failed marriage, her personal life, her possibly difficult role as the daughter of the nation's first Prime Minister.\n''Every position has advantages and disadvantages,'' she once observed. ''I had an advantage because of the education my father gave me and the opportunities of meeting some great people, not only politicians, but also writers, artists and so on. But in politics one has to work doubly hard to show one is not merely a daughter but is also a person in her own right.''\nShe added, ''Of course, being a woman you have to work twice as hard as a man.'' \nOnce, when a visiting journalist asked her to describe Indira Gandhi, the woman, the Prime Minister said: ''In spite of always living in the public glare, she has remained a very private person. Her life has been hard. This has made her self-reliant but has not hardened her.''\nA Lonely Childhood \nIndira Priyadarshini (the second name means ''Dearly Beloved'') was born Nov. 19, 1917, the only child of Jawaharlal Nehru and his wife, Kamala, in Allahabad in northern India. Her grandfather, Motilal Nehru, who owned the house in which they lived, was a brilliant lawyer who discarded a lucrative practice to ally himself with Mohandas K. Gandhi and the Congress Party in the independence movement.\nBy all accounts, the child's early years were painfully lonely. The house served as a headquarters for the freedom struggle; her parents were frequently taken off to jail; the police were constantly there.\n''My public life started at the age of 3,'' she said. ''I have no recollection of games, children's parties or playing with other children. My favorite occupation as a very small child was to deliver thunderous speeches to the servants, standing on a high table. All my games were political ones - I was, like Joan of Arc, perpetually being burned at the stake.\n''I was very headstrong. The whole house was always in a state of tension that nobody had a normal life. There were police raids, arrests and so on, the physical and mental strain. And all the time it was in public.''\nWhat made her childhood even more difficult was the contemptuous treatment given her mother, Kamala, by the far more Westernized and sophisticated women of the Nehru family. Mrs. Gandhi in later life indicated that her own fluency in Hindi, far better than her father's, and her ''Indianness,'' or ability to think and feel as a Hindu Indian, were largely a legacy of her mother. When asked once about the impact of Kamala Nehru on her personality, Mrs. Gandhi replied, ''I saw her being hurt and I was determined not to be hurt.''\nLetters From Her Father \nIn her turbulent childhood - erratic schooling in India and Switzerland, followed by involvement in the independence struggle as a courier and demonstrator - she knew her father chiefly through the famous letters he wrote from a succession of prison cells. The letters, now collected, gave a capsule history of the world from Buddha to Stanley Baldwin and forged a strong link between father and daughter.\n''They were the only companionship I had with my father,'' she recalled. ''That is why I valued them so much.''\nAlthough Nehru was in and out of prison and traveling constantly, his link with his daughter strengthened. ''Nehru was constantly pointing out to the girl the fascinating world around them,'' wrote the journalist Krishan Bhatia, author of ''Indira,'' a biography of Mrs. Gandhi.\nHer formal schooling remained sporadic; she spent three unhappy years at a formal boarding school in Poona and in 1934 went to the university at Santiniketan (Abode of Peace) in West Bengal, founded by Rabindranath Tagore, the Nobel Prize-winning poet and philosopher. It was a brief, almost idyllic experience for the young woman in the unconventional school, where she studied poetry and the Manipuri style of classical Indian dancing. ''In a way,'' she recalled, ''Tagore was the first person whom I consciously regarded as a great man.'' She said that the evenings spent sitting at his feet, talking or watching him paint, were ''moments of serene joy, memories to cherish.''\nA British Education \nKamala Nehru died the following year. In 1937, Indira enrolled at Somerville College, Oxford, where she studied public and social administration, history and anthropology. Although she was in poor condition physically - she was ordered to spend several months in Switzerland to recover from pleurisy - Indira was active in the student wing of the British Labor Party and enrolled as a Red Cross volunteer when World War II began, even working briefly as an ambulance driver in the blitz. \nIn 1941, however, with the Indian independence movement nearing an apparent confrontation with the British, she sailed home with Feroze Gandhi, a newspaperman from Allahabad, who had worked in the Congress movement. He was a childhood friend of Indira, but her family was shocked when she announced, on arriving home, that she and Mr. Gandhi - who was not related to Mohandas Gandhi - planned to marry.\n''Nobody wanted that marriage, nobody,'' she recalled many years later. Mr. Gandhi was of a different religion; she was a Hindu, he was a Parsee, which meant that ''the whole of India was against us.'' But she and Feroze Gandhi were married in March 1942. By September of that year, they were both sent to prison by the British. In fact, the only real domestic period of their troubled marriage was between 1943 and 1946, when they lived in relative quiet in Allahabad. A son, Ranjiv, was born in 1944, and another, Sanjay, in 1946.\nThat year Nehru became Prime Minister of a provisional Government as a prelude to full Indian independence, and Mrs. Gandhi became his official hostess. He enjoyed parties and travel; Mrs. Gandhi was dutiful, almost reluctant. Later, she recalled that she had disliked socializing and making small talk. ''It took me a long time to get over this. But I had to learn to enjoy it, so I did.'' She also said later that she had ''hated'' serving as hostess and once confessed that the crowds, noise, conflict and lack of privacy that marked so much of her life evoked ''considerable bitterness in me.''\nShe was so constantly with her father that, in the recollection of one Indian journalist, few even noticed her. As she grew closer to her father, and his demands on her grew with his prominence, the Gandhi marriage crumbled and the couple began to live apart. Feroze Gandhi went on to become an outspoken member of Parliament; he died in 1960. \nAn Inescapable Calling \nDespite her shyness, and the fact that most politicians, diplomats and journalists viewed her only as Nehru's daughter, Mrs. Gandhi felt almost obligated to play a political role in India. ''She knew that politics was something she could not escape,'' a friend said in 1966, when Mrs. Gandhi first became Prime Minister. ''As a Nehru, she felt it was her destiny. She feels her background gives her a mission she must carry out.''\nAs her father's confidante and companion, Mrs. Gandhi traveled at his side abroad and at home and became a familiar, if somewhat diffident, figure to millions of Indians. Her first step toward national stature was in 1955, when she was elected to the 21- member Congress Party working committee. It was a small step, and she remained withdrawn and self- conscious, but it marked her first move toward an independent political identity. \nFour years later, she was named president of the party, obviously because she was the daughter of Nehru, then at the peak of his power. Yet she herself, then 42 years old, was beginning to emerge as a favorite of the impatient younger members of the party, which was dominated by aging men linked only by the bond of having fought together against the British during India's long struggle for independence. \nSigns of Toughness \nDuring her 11 months as president, she began to display toughness and political assertiveness. She was influential in the ouster of the Communist government in the southern state of Kerala. Six months later, in state elections, she shocked many moderate supporters when she successfully allied Congress with the Muslim League, a sectarian group abhorred by Congress's leaders.\nDespite her success, she turned down the offer of another term, partly because of concern about her father's health and partly because she realized that she was not yet senior enough to run the party as she wanted.\nIn May 1964 Nehru died of a stroke. Mrs. Gandhi went into a period of silent withdrawal for weeks, tending to burst into tears whenever a friend tried to offer condolences. Lal Bahadur Shastri, the new Prime Minister, offered Mrs. Gandhi a Cabinet post; she chose the relatively unprestigious job of Minister of Information and Broadcasting and did a lackluster job.\nBut in 1966, when Mr. Shastri died suddenly, the Congress Party's leaders chose Mrs. Gandhi as Prime Minister. There were two key reasons: First, they felt that she would be pliable, and second, they wished to avoid the obvious choice, Morarji R. Desai, whose career would be intertwined with that of Mrs. Gandhi years later.\nThe New Prime Minister \nHer first year of leadership was one of uncertainty, although she did make some strong moves, such as dividing Punjab and proposing that the commercial banks be nationalized, which was achieved in 1969. In 1967 India's 250 million voters returned the Congress Party to power by a narrow margin; the economy had sunk into a deep recession and the failure of the monsoon for the second consecutive year threatened millions in northeast India with starvation, which was averted by American grain shipments.\nMrs. Gandhi was jolted by the election results, although she had found, to her surprise, that campaigning buoyed her. The closeness of the election made it clear to her that she was the only nationally known and accepted leader for a party that needed streamlining. She promptly announced a 10-point program to bring about a socialist state with a stable economy.\nCongress became a divided party, with an older group forming around Mr. Desai and a younger, more radical faction gathering around Mrs. Gandhi. As the party breach widened, India's President, Zakir Husain, died suddenly in May 1969. Although the position was one of a figurehead, the vacancy set the stage for a struggle for control of the party. \nThe party's elders saw a chance to humiliate Mrs. Gandhi by supporting a candidate who was a known foe. Mrs. Gandhi, gathering her supporters, backed another candidate, thus asking members of her own party to vote with her against their leadership. With the help of nearly two- thirds of the Congress members, her candidate won a narrow victory. It is believed likely that she knowingly precipitated the crisis by dismissing Mr. Desai as Deputy Prime Minister.\nThe Old Guard Reacts \nA few months later, the old guard leadership expelled Mrs. Gandhi from the party for ''grave acts of indiscipline.'' She brushed aside the gesture with characteristic contempt, calling it an illegal act by a group of discredited ''bosses'' and ''dictators'' who wanted to block her socialist programs. The next morning, the Congress Party bloc in Parliament gave her a vote of confidence. \nWith the party split and Mrs. Gandhi maintaining her populist stance, moving to nationalize the banks and eliminate the funds given to princely states, she abruptly called for elections in March 1971, a year ahead of schedule. She hoped to be able to increase her support, as the party split had left her with the backing of only a little more than 200 in the lower house of 525 members. After a 43-day campaign, Mrs. Gandhi emerged with a parliamentary victory of dimensions comparable to those of her father, with her wing of the party winning 350 seats. \nWhen civil war broke out that year in Pakistan, India supported East Pakistan in its fight against West Pakistan and was quickly victorious. East Pakistan became Bangladesh and India became indisputably the dominant power on the Subcontinent. Three months after the end of the war, Mrs. Gandhi cemented her power more strongly, with the capture of 70 percent of the state assembly seats in regional elections. She had reached the peak of success.\nTwo years later, her popularity had plummeted. Her Government faced an economic crisis. Compounding the nation's misery were two severe droughts, inflation, oil-price increases in which she consistently defended the oil producers because they were ''exploited'' by Western nations, and poor planning, with development enmeshed in a web of bureaucracy. \nCharges of Corruption \nHer critics charged, moreover, that she had worsened the problems by misuse of authority, corruption and an erosion of moral leadership. She began to take steps that stirred uneasiness about her final intentions - using emergency measures to imprison strikers and dissident students without trial, taking over the small Himalayan protectorate of Sikkim.\n''There has never been any advice spoken to me that I needed much,'' she once said. ''What influenced me more were the lives of the people I lived with - my mother and my father. That didn't need words.''\nMrs. Gandhi denied repeatedly that she was a mere politician - indeed, she was reportedly even allergic to those two staples of political campaigning in her country, the perpetual dust and the wreaths of marigolds - and saw herself rather as the inevitable destined leader of India. This gave her an armor of disdain against the growing attacks of the opposition, and, it proved in mid-June 1975, fostered the impulses of an autocrat.\nRoots of a Crisis \nThe crisis began with the decision of a high court judge in Mrs. Gandhi's native Allahabad convicting her of two counts of electoral corruption - the specific charges included the use in her election campaign of the services of a Government official and of a rostrum - and declared her election to Parliament invalid. The ruling questioned her right to remain as Prime Minister and prohibited her from running in any election for six years. Not surprisingly, the opposition seized upon the ruling; despite her decision to appeal to a higher court, there was an immediate clamor for her to resign right away.\nBut she said there was ''no question'' of resignation. Instead, at dawn two days later, dozens of opposition leaders, including Mr. Desai, the Deputy Prime Minister, were arrested and taken to jail, and Mrs. Gandhi proclaimed a state of emergency. Acting under a law that was a holdover from British rule, the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, which bestowed sweeping and arbitrary powers on the Government, Mrs. Gandhi had first hundreds and then thousands of people arrested.\nSoon domestic critics and foreign observers were proclaiming that democracy was dead. India's equivalent of the bill of rights was suspended; the press was sharply censored; thousands were jailed incommunicado and without the right to know the charges against them; judicial review of Government acts was severely limited. Constitutional guarantees of civil rights were suspended, as was habeas corpus.\nAs her powers expanded, Mrs. Gandhi serenely ignored the protests, including demonstrations in which several people were killed. ''In India,'' she said, ''democracy has given too much license to people. Even today we are more democratic than any developing country in the world.''\n'Threat to Stability' \nMrs. Gandhi, in this first statement after embarking on her authoritarian program, said she had taken the action in response to a ''threat to internal stability'' and hoped that it would be only temporary. At the same time, she outlined a program of economic changes that she said were designed to bring down prices and achieve a more equitable distribution of land. Critics said that the changes were in fact designed primarily to distract attention from what seemed to be a rapid movement toward a totalitarian state. Other critics, economists, saw the planned ''reforms'' as a patchwork of dubious value. \nMeanwhile, Mrs. Gandhi moved quickly to consolidate her hold. Her Congress Party, which had a majority in Parliament, ratified the state of emergency. Her powers were expanded, with amendments to the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, including one that allowed the Government to seize the property of people who were detained or went into hiding to avoid detention. The opposition condemned her assumption of emergency powers when Parliament opened, but the opposition was increasingly the minority.\nLess than two months after Mrs. Gandhi assumed her new powers, more than 50,000 people were reportedly imprisoned, and Parliament changed the law under which she had been convicted in June. Another bill was passed that prevented her election from even being considered by the judiciary. In a speech on Aug. 15, 1975, the anniversary of India's independence, she said, ''Sometimes bitter medicine has to be administered to a patient only to cure him.'' A few days later, she took aim at external criticism of her actions, saying that unnamed ''casual critics'' applied ''special standards'' to India's behavior. \nRewriting the Law \nIn November, the Supreme Court dismissed the charges against Mrs. Gandhi, basing its ruling on the law passed about two months after her conviction that rewrote the election law so as to omit the offenses of which she had been found guilty. Few were surprised when at the end of December, the Congress Party announced that the elections scheduled for early 1976 had been postponed for a year ''in order to insure continuity in bringing about economic and political stability.' She continued to deny that she had set the country on a course toward totalitarianism. ''Would you be here at all, if we were totalitarian?'' she asked her opposition in Parliament early in 1976, a rhetorical device that ignored that many members of the opposition were not there but in jail. Justifying the imposition of the state of emergency, and its broadening scope, she said: ''Democracy is a value we cherish. If we have these curbs today, it is because democracy was in danger. A handful of people were trying to stop the functioning of the will of the majority.''\nThe shrunken opposition was unconvinced. India, said one opponent, had entered ''an era of darkness.''\nMrs. Gandhi, defending the Government's decision to postpone the elections for a year, said: ''If we held the elections now, we would win. But that is not the point. The point is whether we have greater unity or whether we let loose forces of disruption so that the whole fabric falls apart.''\nIt was an argument that sounded to many like nothing more than a justification for what was rapidly becoming a classic dictatorship. The next conference of her Congress Party, however, predictably called for the continuation of the state of emergency, and in February 1976 an obedient Parliament passed legislation giving the Government the power to suppress ''objectionable material'' in the press.\nChanges in Foreign Policy \nIn foreign affairs, however, there were signs of change, of flexibility. The United States broke off scheduled talks on the resumption of economic aid to indicate displeasure with the continuing policies of repression, but by late April 1976, American diplomats were talking of vague signs of a ''thaw'' in the Government's attitude toward the United States. In the same year, she ended 15 years of coldness between India and China when she sent an Ambassador to Peking.\nMeanwhile, the Government announced that it was sending an ambassador to China for the first time in 15 years, and as a further sign of a new amiability, proposed renewing talks with Pakistan with an eye to normalization of relations. Mrs. Gandhi went to the Soviet Union for a five-day visit after signing a new five- year agreement with Moscow that stressed commercial ties between the two countries.\nDomestically, there was no thaw, and Mrs. Gandhi showed no signs of qualms. In June 1976 the Government extended for one year its right to hold prisoners without trial or even formal charges, a step it said was taken ''for dealing with the emergency.'' India's Supreme Court, meanwhile, had upheld the Government's right to imprison political opponents without hearings. Not content, Mrs. Gandhi proposed in August further constitutional amendments that would give the executive branch, meaning herself, almost unlimited powers.\nPerhaps as a sign of security, the Government allowed opponents to hold meetings to protest these changes in the country's Constitution, which they saw as basically codifying the state of emergency. Predictably, however, the amendments were approved by Parliament.\nPopulation Control \nOne significant domestic issue for Mrs. Gandhi was population control, particularly the question of compulsory sterilization, which was debated in Parliament throughout 1976. She announced that ''strong steps which may not be liked by all'' were under consideration, the sterilization program was pushed and the Government, in September, announced that civil servants were to be prohibited from having more than three children. This renewed emphasis on population control, along with rumors of compulsory sterilization, provoked sometimes violent protests and confrontation. But India in 1976 had the best birth control record in its history. \nOnce again, as the year neared an end, the Government announced that the scheduled elections had been postponed until early 1978, But in early January 1977, Mrs. Gandhi, in a surprise announcement, told the country that elections would be held in March because of her ''unshakable faith'' in the power of the people. It was believed that she was motivated by a certainty that the Congress Party would win easily, as it had won every election since independence. Another strong motive was believed to be a desire to take advantage of a better economic position and to improve India's position abroad. Shortly afterward, Mrs. Gandhi released the last of the political opponents still being held.\nHer campaign theme was that ''only a strong central government can build a stronger India.'' She offered the closest thing to an apology for the stringencies she had imposed, saying, ''We didn't want to cause hardship to anybody but no government would have tolerated the threats, the violence, the assault on democracy that we faced.'' Her oppposition, she asserted, had only one issue, herself. The rapid advancement of her beloved younger son, Sanjay, also became an issue; he had been named to the executive committee of Congress's youth branch at the end of 1975.\nRejection at the Polls \nThe opposition to Mrs. Gandhi had a single theme, expressed by one banner as ''End Dictatorship, Dethrone the Queen.'' On March 20, 1977, the voters did just that, defeating Mrs. Gandhi and making Mr. Desai, whom she had imprisoned two years before, Prime Minister. Mr. Desai headed the Janata Party, the dominant factor in the loose anti-Congress coalition.\nNot for two days after the election results were announced did Mrs. Gandhi leave her residence to go to the presidential palace and hand in her resignation. She said in her resignation speech that ''elections are part of the democratic process to which we are deeply committed.'' She also pledged to continue her aim of serving the people to the ''limit of my endurance.''\nThe new Government announced that its victory was a clear verdict ''against executive arbitrariness'' and began to dismantle the apparatus of legislative repression. In foreign relations, too, there was a sharp turn from Mrs. Gandhi's tilt toward Moscow. ''We do not want any special relations with any country,'' Mr. Desai announced.\nThe Desai Government set up an investigative commission to look into the imposition of emergency rule, but Mrs. Gandhi declined to appear before it. ''The proclamation of emergency,'' she said, ''was a constitutional step, approved by the Cabinet and duly ratified by both houses of Parliament.'' She said that because of ''retrograde, communal and capitalistic forces'' trying to subvert her Government, she had been forced to proclaim the emergency to ''stem the impending disaster.''\nA Personal Triumph \nIn October 1977, after being rebuffed in her efforts to reclaim the leadership of the Congress Party, Mrs. Gandhi was arrested on charges of official corruption. After a few hours in jail - she refused bail - she was ordered released by a magistrate who found no reasonable grounds for her detention. Turning the episode into a personal triumph, she immediately went on a three-day tour of western India; in Bombay, about 25,000 people turned out to greet her.\nHer arrest, she proclaimed, was ''to prevent me from going to the people,'' adding, ''It is an attempt to discredit me in their eyes and the eyes of the world.''\nNow she openly sought a return to power. When a cyclone struck India's east coast, she flew there, saying, ''I want to share the people's sorrow.'' She and local political officials avoided each other as they raced around the flooded areas and through refugee camps.\nIn early 1978, Mrs. Gandhi and her supporters broke away from the regular Congress Party and formed what was known as the Congress-I (for Indira) Party, or to its adherents, the ''real Congress'' party. Any reunion of the two factions, Mrs. Gandhi said, must be headed by her. Once again, as she campaigned through February in state election campaigns, huge crowds gathered. She herself won a by-election in a rural South Indian district later in the year.\nA Long Battle \nHer battle not to testify before the investigative commission, and not to be tried for refusing to testify, dragged through the year. ''I repeat that the commission is not legally competent to require that I should bind myself by taking an oath,'' she said in refusing once again, despite two contempt charges. In May 1978, the commission concluded that the state of emergency had been declared fraudulently and administered arbitrarily. During the summer, the Government charged her with having illegally detained opposition leaders and harassed officials during the emergency. Her son Sanjay was charged with having engaged in illegal demolition of private property.\nHer response was simple: ''Instead of solving the problems of the people, they are trying to divert attention.'' \nIn December 1978, the Government acted to charge her with harassing four Government officials who had been investiating Maruti Ltd., the automobile company set up by Sanjay Gandhi. She denied the charges in Parliament with her usual chill serenity, saying: ''Every man, woman and child in India knows that if the drama of a kind of impeachment of a former Prime Minister is enacted, its sole purpose is not to solve any national problem, but to silence a voice which they find inconvenient.''\nAs the vote in Parliament neared, riots exploded in several cities. After a seven-day debate, the vote on Prime Minister Desai's motion that she be expelled and jailed for the remainder of the session was 279 to 138. In a typical gesture of disdain, Mrs. Gandhi refused to leave the Parliament chamber and to go home ''to be arrested in the dead of night from my house,'' as so many of her opponents had been. \nA Dramatic Gesture \nShe insisted on waiting to be arrested in Parliament, and it was three hours before the arresting officers arrived. As they came she got up on a heavy table to offer friends the characteristic Hindu salutation, ''namaste,'' an inclination of the head over hands placed as if in prayer. Then she was led off. \nPublic response made it clear that she was, with all her faults, still a considerable and revered national figure. Several thousand of her supporters were arrested in clashes with the police, and several people were killed. An airliner was hijacked to protest her imprisonment. She was released when the parliamentary session ended a few days later. ''I had a good rest,'' she said. \nThrough the early months of 1979, her fortunes seemed at an ebb, as pressure grew for investigations into various allegations made against her and Sanjay. The Congress Party was reunited, with its recently disaffected members, the Congress-I faction, merging again with the others. She said, uncharacteristically, that perhaps she had made mistakes and expressed regrets for ''hardships and inconvenience caused.'' Special courts were set up for her trials.\nBut the coalition against Mrs. Gandhi was crumbling under the weight of its failure to resolve India's chronic crises and even more from internal politics, with Mr. Desai badly undermined by Charan Singh.\nDivide and Conquer \nIn July 1979 Prime Minister Desai resigned. Repeating her brilliant 1969 divide-and-conquer victory, Mrs. Gandhi threw her vital support behind Mr. Singh, another man she had once had thrown into prison, as Mr. Desai's successor. At about the same time, a survey showed her to be the single most popular political figure in India's major cities.\nJust as she had more or less created the Singh Government, so she destroyed it by making it clear that she and her followers would oppose a motion of confidence, possibly because Mr. Singh refused to dismiss the charges of corruption pending against her. Shortly after his Government fell, he returned as a caretaker Prime Minister until elections could be held in three months. When asked if in the interim he would be ruling at her pleasure, Mrs. Gandhi replied, ''Yes, or he won't rule at all.''\nWith elections ahead, she worked hard making sure that she was returned to power, campaigning vigorously, forging alliances. In the elections of January 1980, she and her Congress-I Party won a sweeping victory, winning two-thirds of the seats in Parliament. \n ''I don't want to be in power,'' she said in an interview just before the elections, going on to contradict herself by hinting strongly that she had been running things all along: ''Maybe (the Janata Party) made Government policy, but I was at the center of Indian politics. I was the main issue of discussion at every Cabinet meeting.'' And when the returns were in, she said that victory had been won ''entirely on my name.''\nOne of the first major issues she had to deal with was the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. Her position changed several times, sometimes from day to day. But by the end of January, Mrs. Gandhi was saying, ''What happened in Afghanistan is an internal matter of that country.'' An official communique issued after she met with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Andrei A. Gromyko, said only that both sides agreed ''to consider measures by which tensions can be defused in consultation with each other.'' \nThe Loss of a Son \nEarly in 1980, two cases pending against Mrs. Gandhi in special courts were canceled on technical grounds. Her power seemed secure, barely ruffled by growing murmurs that her younger son, Sanjay, was misbehaving. In June 1980, however, Sanjay - her open favorite - was killed in the crash of a small plane. Her control did not break, but few doubted that his death was a severe blow to the Prime Minister.\nIn the years since Sanjay's death, his brother, Rajiv, emerged as their mother's chief political lieutenant, culminating in his being named Prime Minister yesterday. Now 40 years old and a former airline pilot, he was the first among five general secretaries of the Congress-I Party.\nPrickly Relations \nMrs. Gandhi's relations with opposition leaders continued to be prickly at best. In the last year Congress-I tried to topple several state governments hostile to it and to the Prime Minister. Last July in Kashmir, Mrs. Gandhi's forces succeeded in splitting the National Conference Party, enabling a coalition of National Conference defectors and Congress-I members to assume control of the state government.\nIn Andhra Pradesh near the southern tip of the subcontinent, Mrs. Gandhi's allies appeared to have engineered the ouster in August of the state's Chief Minister, N. T. Rama Rao, a highly popular opponent of the Prime Minister. She denied any role in Mr. Rama Rao's removal, which was ordered by a Gandhi-appointed governor. After nationwide protests charging undemocratic practices, a new governor, also named by Mrs. Gandhi, reversed his predecessor's action, and Mr. Rama Rao was permitted to form a new cabinet.\nIn yet another state, Karnataka, which borders Andhra Pradesh, Congress-I officials were charged with using bribes to lure opposition legislators to defect. But leaders of the Janata Party quickly called for a vote of confidence and won it.\nAs of this fall, Mrs. Gandhi could count all but four of India's 22 state govenments in her camp, giving her a strong advantage in a national election. \nThe Sikh Rebellion \nCriticism of her tactics against opposition parties had been balanced by popular approval of her swift action last June to quell an outbreak by Sikh terrorists in the northern state of Punjab.\nThat rebellion came to a bloody climax last June, when Mrs. Gandhi sent Indian troops to storm the Golden Temple in Amritsar, the holiest shrine of the Sikh religion. After 36 hours of fierce fighting between militant Sikhs and the soldiers, the 72- acre temple complex was strewn with bodies. \nAccording to official Government figures, about 600 people were killed in the raid on the temple, including the most militant Sikh leader, Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. Other reports placed the figure as high as 1,200. \nA Force for Unity \nAfter the rebellion, Mrs. Gandhi remained, in the minds of many voters, a strong personal force for national unity. Earlier this year a poll by The Illustrated Weekly found 94 percent of the respondents rating her as an able national leader. \nShe was also a leader on the international level, becoming chairman of the movement of nations professing nonalignment after a summit meeting in New Delhi in March 1983.\nHer stormy political life found an echo in her family relations in the last few years. In 1982 Sanjay Gandhi's widow, Maneka, was evicted from the Prime Minister's house, where she had been living since her marriage. Indira Gandhi, according to family intimates, had opposed the marriage from the beginning.\nThe feud intensified in July when Maneka announced that she would run against her brother-in-law, Rajiv, for his parliamentary seat from a constituency in Uttar Pradesh, the district that Sanjay had represented before his death.\nAs the time neared when the Prime Minister would have to set a date for the election, speculation arose that Mrs. Gandhi might seek to postpone a vote if she felt she was not assured of victory.",

    "text": "STRIFE TEST'S INDIAN ARMY'S COHESION\n1984-06-14T05:00:00.000Z\nThe revolt in the Indian Army by Sikh soldiers who deserted by the hundreds but are now reported to have largely surrendered or been captured has focused attention on India's military, which is regarded as nationalistic, patriotic and professional.\nIndia, with about 1.2 million men and women in the three armed services, ranks after China, the Soviet Union and the United States, in that order, in terms of the numbers of people under arms and in uniform.\nSome units of the army, the oldest of the three services, are more than 200 years old. They saw action in the Indian Mutiny of 1857 and in both world wars, and have fought four wars since India became independent from Britain in 1947. Unlike those of other poor nations, the Indian armed forces have remained uninvolved in politics.\nThe spit and polish, high-swinging arms and high-kicking march at parade time, the salute with the palm of the hand facing out, and the cracking of heavy boots at a shouted order to ''about turn'' all strongly reflect its British origin, as do the bagpipe bands and the army's reputation for efficiency. Foreign Arms Purchases\nOver the years, India's military chiefs have modernized their forces and bought much advanced military hardware from a number of Western powers as well as the Soviet Union. Although the biggest supplier of armaments to New Delhi is Moscow, military experts here say the two countries do not have reciprocal training programs. India, however, still maintains links with Britain and regularly sends officers to the Royal College of Defense Studies.\nApart from the four wars with external enemies - three with Pakistan and one with China - the Indian forces have also been used in the occupation of Goa in 1961, whic was then a Portuguese colony, and in fighting insurgent ethnic minorities in the thickly forested hills of the northeast. They scored a major success in the early 1970's, when they drove Naga and Mizo rebels across the border into Burma and Bangladesh.\nSikhs are prominent in the armed services. One military analyst said today that there were large numbers of Sikh officers but that ''they are not predominant'' in the military hierarchy.\nHe said there were about 20,000 Sikhs in the Indian Army, or about 2 percent of its total strength. Sikhs number about 2 percent of India's population of 700 million. Figures for Sikhs in the air force and navy were not available. Desertions Anticipated\nAnother analyst said that the desertions from the Sikh troops had been anticipated by the Government and that they turned out to be fewer in number than originally feared.\n''But this will not affect the armed forces because the people who deserted were raw recruits, young and at an age when emotions run high,'' the analyst said. ''They hadn't been through the entire training course and were susceptible to incitement.'' He also pointed out that the news blackout on developments in Punjab had led to the spread of rumors that the Golden Temple had been destroyed.\nThere have been mass desertions from the Indian armed forces in the past. In 1942 Indian troops who were captured by the Japanese formed a 6,000-man rebel Indian National Army under the leadership of Subhas Chandra Bose. They saw little action and most of them were captured by the British at the end of the war, tried but released after an upsurge of popular feeling in their favor during the heady days of the nationalist movement before indepdence.\nHowever, desertions in times of peace have rarely been reported. According to one military expert here, about 700 Moslems left the army after it invaded the Moslem state of Hyderabad in 1948 and forced its merger with India. Economic Benefits\nIn a nation that is overwhelmingly poor, entry into the armed forces brings considerable economic benefits - free meals, living accommodations, regular salary, cost of living allowances and an opportunity to travel.\nApart from its role as guardian of India's borders, the army has often been called in by civil authorities to curb major rioting, when the local police and paramilitary forces are unable to control a sitution.\nIn all these situations of domestic unrest, the army has been supervised by the civil administration. Soldiers also are used to help civilians during natural disasters, while the air force organizes drops of food packets, blankets and clothes.\nThe troops are trained at a variety of institutions. New recruits are trained at several regimental centers, like the one at Ramgarh in Bihar state, where the mutiny and major desertions took place on Sunday. After a year or so of training, they are assigned to specific units.\nOfficers are trained at eight military colleges. The main one is the National Defense Academy near Pune in western India, where about 300 officer prospects for all three services are trained every year. After a three-year course they move on to more specialized colleges. For army cadets, that means the Indian Military Academy at Dehra Dun, in northern India. For the air force, it is the Air Force Academy at Hyderabad, in the south, while navy officer trainees are sent to Cochin, on the southwest coast.",

    "text": "JAPAN EXTENDS A HELPING HAND TO ASIA, BUT ONLY SO FAR\n1984-01-29T05:00:00.000Z\nA well-worn word in Japan these days is ''international,'' meaning just about anything from foreign diplomacy to the prevalence of Western faces in television commercials. An ''international Japan,'' the thinking goes, will obviously not be treated like the old Japan, which earned enemies by its insularity, its exclusive preoccupation with selling its products and its potential for military menace.\nHow much the country worries about its reputation was evident last week when Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's Cabinet adopted a $217 billion budget, which was the most austere in 29 years. Few agencies escaped the budget cutters and only two programs received sizable increases. Not coincidentally, both have international dimensions - defense and foreign economic aid.\nThe increase for the military, 6.55 percent, received greater attention, mainly because of concern about the reaction in the United States, where some feel that Japan gets a ''free ride'' on defense at American expense. Mr. Nakasone had calculated that 6.55 percent would be large enough to avert criticism.\nBut even with this extra money, bringing the total to $12.6 billion, Japan will fall farther behind in a planned five-year buildup whose principal goal is to lift some of the burden of sea patrol from the overtaxed United States Pacific fleet.\nRelatively few people paid attention to the foreign aid budget, but it rose far more steeply, by 9.7 percent, to $2.3 billion. This, too, reflected an overriding Government concern with overseas opinion, a desire to erase a widely held notion that Japan does not care about other people's troubles.\nStarting near bargain-basement levels two decades ago, Japanese development assistance has increased almost 30-fold. The Government says it is committed, in the 1981-to-1985 period, to spending a total of $21.4 billion, double the amount provided in the previous five years.\nHowever, despite the additional 9.7 percent, the Government lost ground in its aid-doubling plan. Fiscal rigors have produced smaller increases. To reach the goal now, spending would have to rise by an improbable 30 percent both this year and next.\nMost of the aid money goes for big development projects - an electronics factory in India, a power plant in Malaysia - rather than small-scale food or health programs. Japan's fellow Asians receive the largest share, 70 percent. The rest goes in roughly equal parts to Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. A considerable portion tends to wind up with important trading partners for Japan, but hardly all. Bangladesh and Burma received 13.5 percent of total assistance two years ago, and neither country offers enough trade to keep Japanese exporters awake nights. There is domestic debate about whether Japan is generous. That depends on how one counts. Among the 17 contributing nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Japan ranked fourth in 1982, the latest year for complete statistics. It disbursed $2.3 billion, exceeded only by the United States, West Germany and France, which would have slipped a notch if aid to French overseas territories did not count.\nOn the other hand, Japan was No. 13 in share of gross national product - 0.29 percent - spent on foreign aid. The development organization recommends 0.7 percent. However, the average for the 17 countries was only 0.35; the United States lagged behind Japan with 0.27 percent. The timing of benefits to recipients is difficult to determine. The new budget measures only how much Japan is committed to provide at some later point, not necessarily how much will be spent this year, which could reflect past promises only now coming true. The 1982 budget, for example, committed $1.9 billion to future spending; $2.3 billion was disbursed that year. Then, too, fluctuating exchange rates can unexpectedly compress or expand the assistance program like an accordion. Japan, for the most part, spends its money in yen but other contributing nations gauge performance in dollars. Measured in yen, Japanese bilateral aid in 1982 rose by 18.3 percent above the previous year. However, because the yen's value dropped sharply that year, the increase in dollars amounted to only 4.7 percent. Figuring the PoliticsForeign Ministry officials are hoping for a strengthened yen this year that would make the 9.7 percent increase look even better. Like other affluent countries, Japan is not without political calculation in determining who gets what. Last winter, when Mr. Nakasone became the first postwar Japanese Prime Minister to visit South Korea, he took along a $4 billion package of loans and cheap yen credits. He did the same thing later in Southeast Asia, where many countries are uneasy about Japanese economic expansion. Some critics complain of waste. Others say too much aid comes in the form of loans and not enough as grants that could be spent as the recipient nation wishes. Still others would like more money channeled through international organizations than the relatively slender $283 million committed for 1984. Government defenders reply that, for all the criticism, percentage increases have been large. Besides, they say, any aid effort is akin to swimming upstream. Giving freely, especially to countries looked down upon by many Japanese, is simply not a habit. In no other big industrial nation do nongovernmental groups offer as little overseas assistance. In the United States two years ago, private organizations provided 17.6 percent as much aid as the Government. In Japan, the figure did not reach even 1 percent.",

    "text": "WESTCHESTER JOURNAL\n1984-03-11T05:00:00.000Z\nI F Alice Pedlow of Pleasantville tells you the\ncheck is in the mail, believe her. Take the payment that she mailed out at\nthe beginning of January to the Burke Fuel & Heating Company, a local firm. Normally, Mrs. Pedlow pays her bills in person: ''Everyone in our little town does,'' she explained. ''They don't pay 20 cents to have the post office deliver something one block.''\nBut Mrs. Pedlow had fractured her ankle and so was forced to rely on the mails. She did not become concerned when the fuel company said it never received the payment - aren't the mails always late? Then days turned into weeks and January into February.\nOn Feb. 17, Mrs. Pedlow received something in her own mail box: her missing fuel payment, stamped with a Jan. 25 postmark from ''Dammam'' and adorned with Arabic script.\nMrs. Pedlow, who once lived in Morocco with her husband, Harry , a physician, subsequently learned that Dammam was a town in the oil fields of Saudi Arabia. ''It went a long way for 20 cents,'' Mrs. Pedlow said.\nDid the bill adhere to another envelope, unintentionally accompanying it to the Middle East, as postal officials have suggested? Or was it something more primal, a deep-seated need to follow the path that so many other American dollars have taken because of oil?\nMrs. Pedlow is not pursuing the matter. Still incapacitated, she recently sent her husband off to pay this month's bill in person. - Gary Kriss\nThis year's 26th Annual Grammy Awards presentation, held on Feb. 29 in Los Angeles, had something for almost every musical taste, with live performances ranging from rock to children's music, from gospel to Broadway show tunes. And while those appreciative of classical music didn't get a live performance, they did have the satisfaction of hearing that one of the great musical talents of this century, the late Arturo Toscanini, had been voted to receive the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences' Lifetime Achievement award.\nTo Allan Steckler , seated in the Shrine Auditorium that evening, that news could not have been more pleasing.\nFor more than a year, Mr. Steckler, the owner of the Chambers Record and Video Corporation of Mount Vernon, has been working with Stanley Walker of the Franklin Mint Record Society on a 30-record set of ''The Greatest Recordings of Arturo Toscanini.'' The first volume, a five-record set devoted to symphonies, was released last year and received a Grammy award for best historical re- issue.\n''This is the most pleasurable thing to happen to me in many years,'' said Mr. Steckler, whose career in the music and recording industry has spanned 25 years.\nThe historical re-issue category, Mr. Steckler explained, is by definition the re-release of material from the great classical artists, ''with an ear toward archival purposes, to represent what the artist was doing in a particular period.'' The other five volumes - to be marketed by direct mail - will cover the range of Toscanini's work, with one each devoted to opera, concertinas, tone poems, orchestral showpieces and ''favorites.''\nMr. Steckler spent many hours listening to recordings in the Toscanini family archives and l i brary at Lincoln Center. Toscanini lived for many years in Riverdale, including several years at Wave Hill, where there is a permanent exhibition on his life. Mr. Steckler said it was the first time since the conductor's death in 1957 that such access to the vaults had been approved by both the family and RCA, which owns the rights to the material. The collection will also include as many as five hours of unreleased - but Toscanini-approved - recordings. Much of the material is not stereo and ''sounds a bit dated,'' he said, but the recordings have been re-mastered to make them sound as new as possible. Although this was his first Grammy, Mr. Steckler, who lives in Rockland County, has worked with some of the most popular recording artists of the last 20 years. His association with the Beatles dates back to his days as an executive of Apple Records. He has produced two Beatle anthology records and helped George Harrison produce the ''Concert for Bangladesh'' recording. He was also involved in producing the Rolling Stones collection, ''Hot Rocks.''\n''Toscanini's material is very close to me,'' Mr. Steckler said. ''He was the greatest musical talent to ever live.'' In his role as vice president of the Academy's New York Chapter, and a national trustee for the last 10 years, it was Mr. Steckler who nominated Toscanini for the lifetime achievement award at the national board meeting last May.\n''Toscanini was entirely unique, there is nothing else like him in music,'' he said. ''If nothing else, just making the material available again to students of music so they can hear how certain standards were set, makes it all worthwhile.\n''If you are interested in music, in drama, in hearing an orchestra sound like you've never heard before, Toscanini was head and heels over anyone else,'' Mr. Steckler said. - John B. O'Mahoney\nThe ''Gourmet Gala'' held last fall at Bloomingdale's by the March of Dimes's Westchester-Rockland-Putnam chapter, was so successful that food is on its way to becoming a staple in the organization's fund-raising efforts. The accent will once again be on eating when the chapter raises money through dinner parties at 20 area restaurants on March 28.\nFor $50, an individual will eat with nine other contributors at one of the participating establishments. At most of the restaurants, the owner will sit with the group, explaining special dishes that have been prepared for the occasion. Those donating their services for the event, which is dubbed ''Dining Out for the March of Dimes,'' are:\nAuberge Argenteuil in Hartsdale, Boulderburg Manor in Tompkins Cove in Rockland County, Corniches la Reserve in White Plains, Gregory's in White Plains, Harralds in Stormville, Ho Yen in Mount Kisco, Jillyflowers in Harrison, the Jockey Club in White Plains, the Kittle House in Mount Kisco, Kona-Kai at the Marriott in Tarrytown, La Cremaillere in Banksville, Mallard's at Arrowood of Westchester in Ryebrook, Maxime's in Granite Springs, Penfield's at Rye Town Hilton, Pennybridge in Tarrytown, Rene Chardain in South Salem, the Saute Cafe in Pleasantville, Sergio's in Hartsdale, Tuttles in the White Plains Hotel, and Wampus Lake American Inn in Armonk.\nSeating is limited to 10 people per restaurant; guests should indicate first, second and third choice. For reservations, call 949-7166.\nThe idea was conceived by Charles Phillipe DiCesare , who is the chapter chairman of March of Dimes and general manager of La Reserve Hotel. ''My inspiration was the benefit held by the New York Public Library held this winter - they had separate dinner parties all around New York,'' Mr. DiCesare. ''I was thrilled with that idea. Also, our Gourmet Gala had so much feedback - no pun intended. We received a few dozen letters asking when our next food-related benefit would be.''\nMr. DiCesare also described the menu planned for guests at Corniches: Billi bi, mussel soup with saffron; mousse de canard; lukewarm salad of spinach, French scallops and hazelnut dressing; cucumber dill sorbet; rack of veal with three types of wild mushrooms, and raspberry souffle. The wines will be Puligny Montrachet '82, Chateau Lafite Rothschild '76 and Chateau D'Yquem '75.\n''We asked every restaurateur to do a menu that would represent what the chef likes to do best,'' Mr. DiCesare said. ''I went to my chef, Wolfgang Rapp , and he came back with this menu. I think it's terrific!'' - Lynne Ames",

    "text": "STATE DEPARTMENT; AMERICAN EMBASSY IN ISRAEL: THE RUNAWAY ISSUE\n1984-03-27T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Congress and the Administration are engaged in a kind of election year game with possibly dangerous implications if it is not handled with proper sensitivity.\nMore than 30 Senators and 200 Representatives have co-sponsored a bill to move the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, a measure that the Administration says would be disastrous to American interests.\nBut many of the co-sponsors, who signed the legislation out of principle or out a desire to win favor from pro- Israeli constituents, or both, are privately saying they have created a monster that they hope will be killed before it comes to a vote.\nThe American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the leading pro-Israel lobby in Congress, is officially supporting the bill, but did not originate it. It was introduced by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, who has been pushing the issue for four years, saying the bill should be passed as a sign of American support for Israel.\n'Only the Second Inning'\nA House staff aide said he was sure a compromise would eventually be reached. ''It's like a baseball game,'' he said. ''This is only the second inning. I think by the sixth or seventh inning, there'll be a lot more talk of compromises than you hear now.''\nA Democratic leader said: ''Many members are pleading with me not to bring it out to the floor. They know it is a terrible bill and a terrible policy, but they also say that if there is a vote, they will vote for it.''\nThe Moynihan bill is brief:\n''To require that the United States Embassy in Israel be located in the city of Jerusalem:\n''Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, Notwithstanding any other Act, the United States Embassy in Israel and the residence of the American Ambassador to Israel shall hereafter be located in the city of Jerusalem.'' Little Notice at First\nAt first the bill received virtually no publicity. On Feb. 23, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing at which Mr. Moynihan testified in favor of his bill and Lawrence S. Eagleburger, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, provided the Administration rationale on why the embassy should not be moved.\nBut the bill gradually started to take on a life of its own and attract additional co-sponsors. There are now more than 30 co-sponsors in the Senate and 200 in the House.\nIt has also been raised to an issue of Presidential politics. President Reagan, citing traditional American policy against moving the embassy to Jerusalem, has asked Republicans not to support the measure. Walter F. Mondale and Gary Hart, the leading candidates for the Democratic Presidential nomination, have both said they would move the embassy to Jerusalem if elected.\nOf all the issues worrying the State Department for the moment, the Jerusalem bill has the highest priority, department officials said, with the exception of the pending aid request for El Salvador. Warnings From Moslem Nations\nGovernments of Moslem countries, not just in the Arab world but in such places as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Senegal, Indonesia and Malaysia, have warned the American Embassies in those countries that if the bill is passed by Congress (no distinction seems to be made whether or not it is vetoed by the President) they cannot guarantee that extremists in their countries will not seek vengeance on Americans and American property.\nMorocco is head of an Islamic Conference committee on Jerusalem, and its Ambassador in Washington, along with envoys from some 10 other Islamic countries, have been quietly paying calls on the Senate majority leader, Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, and such House leaders as Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe and the Near East.\nThe ambassadors have been telling the members of Congress that Jerusalem is not just an Arab-Israeli matter, but of concern to the entire Moslem world and that if the American Embassy is moved to Jerusalem it will be seen as an unfriendly move by the United States. Shultz Letter to Percy\nSecretary of State George P. Shultz, in a letter to Senator Charles H. Percy, Republican of Illinois, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, wrote on March 5:\n''We must also keep in mind that in the current environment, a move of our embassy would certainly fan Islamic extremism, possibily inciting a wave of violence against our citizens, diplomats and installations in the region.''\nMr. Shultz also made the other Administration arguments against the bill: it would undercut American hopes of being able to broker future Arab-Israeli negotiations, in which one of the key issues will be the status of the city of Jerusalem, and it would raise ''very serious separation of powers'' questions, since the site of an embassy ''is an exercise of the President's exclusive constitutional responsibilities to conduct diplomacy and to determine the country's recognition policy.''\nHe ended his letter by saying he hoped Mr. Percy would use his influence ''to discourage action on this bill.'' Arabs Rejected Plan in '47\nIn 1947, the United Nations partition plan for Jerusalem envisioned Jewish and Arab nations co-existing in British Palestine, with the city of Jerusalem to be internationalized and administered by the United Nations. The Jews accepted, but the Arabs rejected the plan.\nAs the result of the war launched by the Arabs in 1948 to crush the new nation of Israel, Israel controlled western Jerusalem, but Jordan captured and controlled East Jerusalem. Israel moved its capital to western Jerusalem in 1949, but the United States kept its embassy in Tel Aviv and protested the Israeli move as prejudging the future status of the city. U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem\nAfter the 1967 war, Israel incorporated the whole city of Jerusalem, and Labor Party and Likud bloc Governments have said they will never give it up. From time to time, Israel has pushed for governments to move their embassies to Jerusalem, but only Costa Rica has an embassy there. It has not been a major issue in recent years between Israel and the United States.\nThe arguments used by Mr. Moynihan and others in favor of forcing the move to Jerusalem are that in every other country, the United States has its embassy where the capital is, that not to do so would be to yield to threats and that it is time to face reality.\nHe has argued that by refusing to acknowledge that Israel's capital is Jerusalem, the United States ''tells the world that we are somehow at odds or displeased with Israel.''\n''This gives encouragement and false hope,'' he said, ''to those enemies of Israel who hope one day to be able to divide the United States from Israel.''",

    "text": "Sports of The Times ; The Burma Team\n1984-08-01T05:00:00.000Z\nLOS ANGELES The Burma team spends its days\nand nights observing the boxers\nand other athletes at the Summer Games. The Burma team is compiling information to bring home when these Games are over.\nThe Burma team has plenty of time for learning new techniques because the Burma team lost his first boxing match on Sunday and has two full weeks before the closing ceremonies.\nThe Burma team is Zaw Latt, 26 years old, the Southeast Asian Games light-welterweight champion, and the only athlete his country chose to send to the Summer Games, along with the Burmese delegation - one coach, one chef de mission.\n''He is not sad,'' said Nyein Aung, the chef de mission, the only man in the delegation who speaks English. ''He is quite busy.''\nZaw Latt - both names are used in Burma - has no teammates, no other athletes from his company to train with, to eat with, to laugh with, perhaps even to grumble with.\nHe is a one-man band, just like Saidurrahman Dawn, the 200-meter runner from Bangladesh, about whom one could write a novel, The Loneliness of the Short-Distance Runner.\nThese one-person teams are a rarity at the Summer Games because the International Olympic Committee underwrites the travel costs for six persons from every nation, two officials and four athletes. Many nations take advantage of this largess to send their best athletes, no matter what their prospects, but Burma was too realistic for that.\n''Performance is not good,'' Nyein Aung said yesterday. ''We are training for Southeast Asia Games. We are very far from Olympic records. Too much difference to send.''\nThere is a sense of pride in the\nBurmese delegation that it has\nsent athletes to every Summer Games but one since Burma gained its independence in 1948. Nyein Aung says his nation will only send athletes who have a chance. For these Games, Zaw Latt was that athlete.\nZaw Latt is something of a national hero, a product of the military athletic program in a country with not a great deal of money to spend on sports. He comes from northern Burma, was recruited into the army at the age of 18, is married, has two children, and lives somewhat better than the average soldier or civilian.\nHe took military training, learned to fire a gun and wear a uniform, but his main job was to box. His coach, Khin Maung Win, the Southeast Asia Games champion of 1959, prepared him for the 1983 games, which he won, prompting his trip to the Summer Olympics.\nThe Burmese delegation left Rangoon, ''The Garden City of the East,'' with its lakes and trees and pagodas, on July 23, beginning an odyssey that took so many hours and time zones that Nyein Aung has lost track.\n''We went through Bangkok and arrived in Hong Kong on July 24th,'' he said. ''It was around 8 P.M. The next morning we arrived in Tokyo but it was still the 24th around 3 P.M. We took off again and when we got to California, it was still the 24th. Jet lag. Very tired.''\nThe Burma team was disoriented when he arrived in Los Angeles, ''so tired he could not sleep,'' Nyein Aung said. ''We are all upset, but after two or three days, we are used to it. We take training on the 26th but we are still very sleepy.''\nThe Olympic village at the University of Southern California\ncan give off culture shock even to a journalist who wandered in off the street. The energy level from young athletes and their healthy-looking coaches is high, and it is magnified by the stares and smiles as people from different continents, different languages, different religions, check each other out.\n''Zaw Latt is very happy with the food,'' Nyein Aung said. ''He likes rice and curry very much, and he also likes steamed fruit and vegetables.''\nBecause Zaw Latt and Khin Maung Win do not speak a word of English, there have been a few touchy moments. Nyein Aung said: ''One day they had to go to the weigh-in but I could not go with them. I was worried because they don't speak English, but they got there.''\nLast Saturday the Burmese delegation marched in the opening ceremonies. Nyein Aung carrying the flag, alongside a young American escort, and the coach and the Burma team bringing up the rear.\nThe next day, the Burma team went into competition against Christopher Ossai from Nigeria. In the first round, Zaw Latt stung his opponent with some good punches and came close to a knockout, but the second round was even and, ''before the third round, he felt he had the upper hand,'' Nyein Aung said.\nBut the Nigerian won the third round so handily that he was given a 5-0 decision over the Burma team. Nyein Aung said: ''Zaw Latt felt it was a fair decision.''\nZaw Latt was not the first person eliminated from the Olympics. That distinction may have been won by Merilyn Phillips of the Cayman Islands, who stopping cycling on the first 9.8-mile lap of the women's road race, shortly after 9:30 A.M.\nFor the athletes who lost early, that left two weeks until the closing ceremonies.\n''We will stay to the end,'' Nyein Aung said. ''We have to study all about the Olympics. Zaw Latt is watching the swimming and boxing every day. It is very difficult. We want to study how they train and how they compete.''\nThe hardest part of Zaw Latt's losing came when Nyein Aung had to call Rangoon by telephone to inform the sports officials there. Nyein Aung said tentatively: ''The sportsmen know about losing but other people may not.''\nZaw Latt has not spoken to his wife since he left home on July 23. Yesterday he was either at the boxing or the swimming - Nyein Aung was not sure - observing the athletes of other nations.\n''He does not go to the disco at night,'' Nyein Aung said. ''He is not that type of person. He has friends from Thailand, Singapore, Maylaysia, and Indonesia. They speak an international language. He is sad because he lost but he is working here for his country. We are participating in the Olympics. We will stay to the end.''",

    "text": "ASSESSING OPEC'S MEMBERS\n1984-10-29T05:00:00.000Z\nOnly a few years ago, oil exporting countries had more money than they could spend, and petroleum seemed an elixir that would keep them strong. Now, as somber oil ministers confer in Geneva at an emergency meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, declining world demand for oil and rising production have changed the picture.\nTheir economies still reeling from the $5-a-barrel cut in oil prices in March 1983, the ministers will now try to agree on price cuts or lower production quotas. Either method will mean less revenue, which experts say will be painful for all and economically excruciating for a few.\nNine of the 13 OPEC members depend on oil for more than 90 percent of their export income, and for several the figure is 99 percent.\nIn interviews last week, experts painted sharply different pictures of how OPEC members would fare if oil revenues decline even more. Some nations, such as Kuwait and Indonesia, have diversified and acquired other major sources of income. Others, such as the United Arab Emirates, where income averages about $25,000 a person, will still be rich even if they lose a chunk of their income. But still others are in a much worse position, especially Nigeria and the Latin American debtor nations. However, specialists on those countries think they could survive further cuts and slowly recover.\nWhat follows is an analysis of the OPEC countries and Mexico and the possible effects on them of further cuts in revenue. Algeria In the oases of southern Algeria, where life among the mud brick houses and mosques is poor and harsh, a visitor would never guess that this is an oil country. But life would be much poorer and harsher without the oil and gas that furnish 98 percent of the country's exports.\nThis vast North African country - a third the size of the United States - depends more on natural gas than on oil, but falling oil prices have also affected gas. Although the Government appears firmly in control - especially compared with neighboring Tunisia and Morocco, where austerity measures provoked major rioting in the last year - analysts believe that more of an economic squeeze may cause dangerous dissatisfaction among the young. Ecuador The leading banana exporter in the world, Ecuador may have to rely more on bananas and less on oil in the future. Petroleum now brings home 73 percent of export earnings, but the economy must cope with a $6.7 billion foreign debt as well as with the quarter of the labor force that is unemployed or underemployed.\n''We depend very, very heavily on oil exports,'' said Mauro Davalos, Ecuador's petroleum attache in Washington. ''The main problem right now is to pay our debts. And the main source of dollars is oil exports. If we have fewer dollars, we will have trouble paying our debts.'' Gabon This Central African country is OPEC's smallest producer at about 160,000 barrels a day. This oil, which provides about 75 percent of export revenue, has made the population of about 600,000 the richest in sub-Saharan Africa on a per-capita basis. State Department sources say Gabon is in relatively good shape and further austerity measures would not cause much discontent. Indonesia The 150 million people in this South Asian country have an average income of only $580 per year - the lowest in OPEC. But it is the OPEC member least dependent on oil for foreign exchange. About 45 percent of export earnings come from other sources, including timber, coffee and rubber. When the economy ground to a halt in 1983 after booming for a decade, the Government acted quickly to cut spending and raise taxes.\n''Indonesia's different,'' said Malcolm Gillis, a Duke University professor. ''They were the first of OPEC's members to recognize the probability of declining oil prices beginning in '83 or '84. They've done everything that sensible analysts would do to protect them from declining oil prices.'' Iran ''Iran probably will be one of the worst hit,'' said a college professor who closely follows that country. Iran, which at the beginning of 1984 was producing about 2 million barrels a day, now is reduced by its war with Iraq to about 1 million barrels a day, oil industry sources said. Moreover, to compensate buyers for war risk, Iran has chipped up to $4 off the price of each barrel. Because Iran depends on oil for 93 percent of export earnings, experts expect Iran to continue to prove adept at circumventing OPEC quotas or official prices. Iraq Expect Iraq to be a passionate proponent of slashing OPEC quotas to maintain prices, analysts say. That is because Iraq can only export about 800,000 barrels a day, by pipeline through Turkey, as long as the war goes on. Since that is one-third less than its quota, the Iraqis would prefer to have their quota drop rather than see lower prices for the oil they can get out.\n''They're not at the brink of disaster. They've acquired a lot of arms, and they're very well equipped now,'' said Michael Sterner, a partner in the IRC Group, a Washington-based international consulting firm. Kuwait ''Kuwait can cut production drastically during an oil glut as part of a concerted OPEC effort to support the official price. In doing so it will experience only minimal pressure on financial policy,'' predicts a forthcoming book by Richard P. Mattione on OPEC investments.\nKuwait's strong position derives from careful investments abroad, which now supply earnings that are almost as important to the economy as oil and gas revenues. Libya Oil accounts for virtually 100 percent of Libya's exports, and these revenues have been cut in half in three years. Although the Government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi has embarked on some grandiose capital projects recently, it has also tried to raise taxes and to cut the consumption of imports.\n''Qaddafi has been grasping at straws for a while, because his fortunes have been falling as oil prices fall,'' said Lisa Anderson, an assistant professor at Harvard University on leave to Columbia University. ''At some point you wonder if this is going to be the last straw, but I don't think it will be.'' Nigeria When Nigeria became independent in 1960, 90 percent of export earnings came from agriculture and only 2.6 percent from oil. Now 94 percent of earnings come from oil and Nigeria is a net food importer. Shanty towns line Lagos, and beggars plead with executives stepping out of limousines.\n''Nigeria is not only the sick man of OPEC, it's the sick man of the oil world,'' said Arpad Von Lazar, a professor at the Tufts University Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.\nBut Landis MacKellar, an economist with Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, said that even with a $2-a-barrel cut in the price of oil, Nigeria should reduce its current-account deficit and enjoy modest economic growth in 1985. Qatar This opulent sheikdom has a population of only about 240,000, of which only one person in five is a native Qatari. The rest - other Arabs, Pakistanis, Indians and Bangladeshis - may be encouraged to leave if there is a pinch. However, Qatar is wealthy enough that it should withstand revenue cuts quite easily, experts say. Saudi Arabia With more than $100 billion in reserves and a population of only 5 million indigenous Saudis, the country is not likely to feel severe pain, experts say.\n''They'll have to make hard decisions, and this isn't a system that's good at making tough decisions,'' said William B. Quandt, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Saudi Arabia has curtailed new construction and is stretching out payments to foreign companies, but the mood is one of ''self-confidence, if not complacency,'' according to a Dubai- based journalist. United Arab Emirates The richest country in the world, the emirates are expected to cope with cuts in oil income. But declining revenue has resulted in strains among the sheikdoms that form the country. Abu Dhabi, the principal oil producer, has had to cut its production because Dubai and Sharjah continue to produce at high levels. A few weeks ago Abu Dhabi began discounting its oil sharply, sources said, although it stopped after Saudi Arabia protested and called the OPEC conference that begins today. Venezuela ''Venezuela's going to go through a lot more suffering, I think, and cry a lot more,'' predicted a banker who follows that country. Others agree that the 17 million Venezuelans, who once enjoyed the most robust economy in South America, are likely to see continued economic decline of the type that has burdened the country for several years. The economy shrank 4.8 percent last year alone.\nWith repayments on the hefty $37 billion debt dependent on oil revenue - which makes up 94 percent of export earnings - Venezuela's plight may be passed on to American banks. But officials sound optimistic. Carlos Guillermo Rangel, the chief debt negotiator, said in Caracas last week that oil income projections are conservative and that the country could absorb a production cut of 100,000 barrels a day. Mexico Although it is not an OPEC member, Mexico has indicated that it will agree to a modest production cut as part of OPEC's strategy to maintain prices. For this heavily indebted economy, which depends on oil for three-fourths of its foreign exchange, declining oil revenues would have serious consequences, experts agreed. Mexico's own calculations show that a $2-a-barrel price cut would cost it $1 billion a year.\nWhen the base price of oil was $29 a barrel, Mexico's President, Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado, said that his country could handle the strains if the price dropped to $27. With analysts warning that the price could slip even lower, Mexican workers might find their real wages sinking beyond the 30 percent to 40 percent cut they already have taken in the last two years.",

    "text": "GETTING THE WORLD IN A FAMILY WAY\n1984-04-29T05:00:00.000Z\nSEX AND DESTINY \n The Politics of Human Fertility. By Germaine Greer. 539 pp. New York: Harper & Row. $19.95. \n IN ''The Female Eunuch'' (1971), Germaine Greer\nchallenged women to change the way they thought\nabout themselves, sex, love and society. Now, in a\nfresh sortie on our sensibilities, she hopes to jolt us into questioning our assumptions once again.\nWho are we, in the West, she asks, to impose our views about sex and family size on all the peoples of the earth? Why do we delude ourselves into thinking that the population ''problem'' is ours to solve by the shipment of information and technology to the world's poor? Our conviction that we must do something about other people's reproductive behavior, almost despite them, stems from the assumption that the world belongs to us. Yet, she argues, it is we who are depleting the world's resources and endangering its future with our nuclear arsenal. How dare we become the surrogate keepers of the world's poor when we have constructed a society of our own in which the roles of parent and child are difficult to play and find little reward?\n''Sex and Destiny'' is aimed at correcting a view Miss Greer attributes to population planners: that the fertility decline in the developed world is a product of our concern for society's welfare. It is therefore assumed that we can instill the same concern, with the same results, in the fertile poor of the world. But the fertility decline of the developed world, she maintains, has nothing to do with a sense of global responsibility; it stems instead from the threat of a fall in our standard of living. If we acknowledged this, we might understand that the best family planning services would let people define their own needs. \nThe tone of the present work is both more compassionate and more desperate than Miss Greer's earlier feminist polemic. In the opening pages of ''Sex and Destiny,'' Miss Greer asserts that in the industrialized West, we have created a society that does not like children. Moreover, our children do not like us. Our fear of exploding populations is seen as a phobia - held by our own rich, greedy, infertile, Caucasoid sub-group - that our standard of living is threatened by the economic demands of the over-fertile poor at home and abroad. She regards the low birthrate in the West, and the sorry place of mothers, children and old people in the developed world, as the end-point of economic and political forces that we may recognize but do not know how to remedy. ''Sex and Destiny'' is an account of how the industrial West arrived at its present predicament, and a pained admission that there may be no return to the presumed riches of a family-centered world.\nNo reader will be left unaffected by this book. Miss Greer's passionate and intentionally provocative style either entertains or enrages, depending on how distant her readers judge themselves to be from aggravated verbal assault. Few who have publicly expressed an opinion - or even had passing thoughts - about sex, fertility and the family escape her dour glance. Demographers, anthropologists, family planning agencies, ''white Protestant materialists,'' ''bigoted modern liberals,'' the critic Clive James, sex reformers, Catholic lobbyists, pop psychologists, ''Pangloss historians of the family,'' Engels, ''muddled Socialists,'' ''earnest Malthusians,'' ''the population control apparatchiks,'' ''mentally confused officials of mental health institutions'' and ''the gullible public'' all take their lumps. Capitalists, advocates of the consumer society and partisans of the modern nuclear family are chastised severely. This is a feast of strongly held, strongly expressed opinions, delivered as a stern lesson from the podium.\nA sympathetic reader, however, will find much to Shirley Lindenbaum , an anthropologist on the graduate faculty of the New School for Social Research, has worked in New Guinea and Bangladesh. She is editor-designate of The American Ethnologist. admire. The research that has gone into ''Sex and Destiny'' is impressive. Miss Greer shows a firm understanding of the context in which the birthrate in the developed world has fallen and of the pressures close kin or distant government bureaucracies can exert on the would-be childbearer. She is alert to the problematic impact of Western medicine on traditional societies, as well as to the losses involved in the progressive medicalization of fertility and birthing in our own society. She has a clear sense of the way notions about fertility underlie human ethical systems, and she points out that Soviet state capitalism and corporate capitalism in the United States both shatter family ties. Her travels through India and her reading of family planning literature lead her to challenge the view that the poor are born rather than made; she rejects the notion that sterilization is an appropriate method of regulating fertility in impoverished countries with high birth rates. Most people would also share her hope that fertility can be safely controlled by means other than the wholesale destruction of fetuses.\nHer attempt to outflank imagined debating foes, however, often causes her to overreach and to undermine her own position. She will concede, for instance, that when women, rather than a medical establishment, exercised control over their own fertility, the consequences sometimes included such practices as infanticide and traumatic abortion; but then she is quick to assure us that ''infanticidal peoples'' had tremendous affection for their remaining children. She applauds the extended family still found in peasant and horticultural societies for providing support and a context for mothering, but concedes that it may offer a more boring and oppressive environment than the familial contours of the West. She admits that the closeness of adults and children in some Indian families is achieved partly at the cost of women's seclusion and low literacy, and she is compelled to draw our attention to the fact that some dispossessed and elderly women are to be found begging and dying on the streets of India. Such disadvantages of the extended family are, however, more than offset in her mind by the rewards to be derived from the role of matriarch - which, she says, can be achieved by an ''intelligent and determined woman.'' We are told, again in praise of extended-kin ties and family structures, that people living in traditional societies today can trust only their own kin. It is also the case, she notes, that brothers steal from brothers and that families are as full of bad blood as good, but the struggle is said to be in some way better because it is on a more ''human scale.'' Or she will insist that only multigenerational families can give shape and coherence to all the phases of human life, but then acknowledge that new brides in India are sometimes immolated by their in-laws on their own cooking stoves. She could have inspired our skepticism with less ammunition. Her airy dismissal of this parade of atrocities gives her work the stamp of exhortation rather than reasoned debate.\nHER stance also creates many paradoxes. She challenges the credo of sexual radicals, among whom she must in some way be counted, that the authoritarian state is formed on the model of the patriarchal family. This presumption must be questioned, she urges, if we are to understand how the sexual revolution has been co-opted. The state, she argues, is formed not by analogy to the family, but in imitation of the army and the church, institutions that use sexuality as a means of control. State, church and army take over many family functions, sap its autonomy and hinder it from acting in its own interest. She acknowledges the irony of her position as a 20th-century feminist extolling the virtues of the extended family, since most extended-kin groups are patriarchal. She minimizes the drawbacks for women, however, and extols the extended family because it labors and produces for its own members, and is thus the best impediment to the establishment of consumer society on earth.\nShe acknowledges that her opposition to sexual permissiveness, sex clinics and sex education places her in paradoxical proximity to ''bigots and body haters.'' Miss Greer believes that sex education takes the pleasure out of sex and leads to an orthodoxy that she fears will quench the human creativity that might renew the world. Her dream of a regenerated future depends on liberating the human libido from current convention and petty gratification. \nSex knowledge in our society has become an ideological tool, Miss Greer says, because it includes a system of values appropriate to a bureaucratic, consumer society. By disseminating sex knowledge, we promote methods of manipulation and control that maintain our own ''pseudo-democracies.'' From this perspective, sex reformers have become the bawds of capitalism. Her view of the choices available to the sexually inventive woman, however, presumes that many women have educational backgrounds equal to her own. Instead of recommending the abolishment of sex education and reduced access to abortion services for pregnant teen- agers, she perhaps should campaign for education that would equip young women to better evaluate their situation in the world.\nHer strong advocacy of coitus interruptus as a method of birth control may seem curiously antiquated, but it was foreshadowed in ''The Female Eunuch.'' Don't marry and don't consume, she advised in 1971. Share clothes, make your own cosmetics, form cooperative households and circulate household appliances to lessen the role of women as principal consumers in the capitalist state. Coitus interruptus, then, is a do-it-yourself form of birth control that is hard to institutionalize and does not contribute to the ''zillion-dollar'' contraceptive drug empire. Oral sex, anal intercourse, coitus interruptus and abstinence are proposed as a package of effective contraceptive methods that would free women from damaging forms of birth control, as well as keep sexual creativity out of the hands of the pharmaceutical industry and the agents of Western cultural hegemony.\nTHE book makes a theoretical link between controlling fertility and waging nuclear war by way of the argument that people who do not care to reproduce also do not care whether they die out, in a genetic sense. Miss Greer's apocalyptic vision is not one in which the poor of the world crowd out the under-reproducers. Rather, the greater danger in her mind is the eradication of humankind by people who do not feel themselves tied to the next generation. \nIn addition to sharp insight, authoritative statements, moralistic rhetoric, unexpected romanticism and a flirtation with sociobiological interpretation, one can find in ''Sex and Destiny'' a mine of information and misinformation. Every reader will have his or her own list of bloopers but mine include the following: The Dani of New Guinea may observe prolonged postpartum sexual abstinence, but they are not the peaceable people Miss Greer supposes. Dani pursue warfare on a scale surprising even among New Guinea Highlanders. During one massacre in 1966, for example, a population of 2,000 lost 125 people. Nor is life in extended families the ideal paradigm for female collectivity. The emotional dissatisfactions and social impediments experienced by women in Indian families are well-documented, at least for upper and middle-class Hindus and some Muslims. Contrary to her assumptions, anthropologists are indeed interested in the erotic content of human relationships, although this admittedly is a recent trend. That oral contraceptives cause clinically significant nutritional depletion is under study, and is not yet proven. Her notion that ''beauty has no commodity value'' in the marriage negotiations of women in extended families is rather wide of the mark, as is her dreamy assumption that the most valued commodity is a ''loving heart.'' And, if concepts of sexuality can change along with social and cultural contexts, as Miss Greer suggests, she should question her statement that bride price in traditional societies is merely the purchase of sex, and that nothing about our modern situation is new except its scope and intensity.\nContemporary society may indeed be striking the heaviest blow against kinship and kindness, but extended-kin ties, reproductive strategies and certain forms of sociability have been in trouble since agriculturalists first pressed their ways upon small bands of hunters and gatherers. Perhaps we should not grieve for family forms we have not known and that may not be resuscitated. We might yet devise patterns of social relatedness, possibly modeled on past arrangements, that give a greater sense of fulfillment. If Germaine Greer thinks this an overly cheerful speculation, she should remember that it was she who told us that the family is not a static phenomenon, but a process. In light of the social emergencies of contemporary life that rightly cause her alarm, her recipe for a regenerated future, the freeing of the human libido, appears to be a retreat from reality. Individual eroticism is not the stuff of social movements. There are the makings here of a Tantric cult, perhaps, but even Tantrics institutionalize sexuality in ways that Miss Greer might find unacceptable.\n''Sex and Destiny'' registers the outraged cry of a woman who has tried to resolve the competing claims of work and love in a world still weighted against an easy solution. The paradox she has not yet faced is how to achieve her vision of an autonomous, creative life unencumbered by the interests of wider collectivities and institutions. Readers may also remain unpersuaded by the book's opening proposition. Do we in the West refrain from childbirth because we do not like children? Following her own style of argument, it could as easily be said that, like ''infanticidal peoples,'' we have tremendous affection for those we have.B\n Children of the West Historically, human societies have been pro- child; modern society is unique in that it is profoundly hostile to children. We in the West do not refrain from childbirth because we are concerned about the population explosion or because we feel we cannot afford children, but because we do not like children. Conventional piety is still such that to say such a thing is shocking. Parents will point angrily to the fact that they do not beat or starve or terrorize their children, but struggle to feed, house, clothe and educate them to the best of their ability. Our wish that people who cannot feed, house, clothe and educate their children adequately not have them is born of our concern for the children themselves, or so we would claim. At the heart of our insistence upon the child's parasitic role in the family lurks the conviction that children must be banished from adult society. Babies ought not to be born before they have rooms of their own: when they are born they must adhere to an antisocial timetable. Access to the adult world is severely rationed in terms of time, and in any case, what the child enters is not the adult's reality but a sort of no-man's land of phatic communication. - From ''Sex and Destiny''",

Mobile tanks of the frothy, fizzy, sour brew, each manned by a sturdy matron in a once- white smock, appear on street corners the day the fur hats are put away. Twelve kopecks (about 15 cents) buys a full liter, dispensed in a communal mug that gets sloshed out over a jet of water between customers. The lines move quickly - lingering over a drink is certain to draw comments from parched Russians waiting for a turn at the mug.\nThe brownish beverage, brewed from fermenting rye flour or rye bread, malt and sugar, is not particularly refined. Visitors tend to shy away at first from the brackish taste and the shared mugs. But the forewarned tourist can bring his own vessel, and the taste grows on you, particularly after a three-hour hike through the un-air-conditioned halls of the Tretyakov Art Gallery.\nThe genesis of kvass is uncertain, but it is easily as Russian as vodka, black bread or borscht. (There is even an expression, kvasnoi patriotism, which is used to describe unquestioning, extreme Russian nationalism.) It used to be mandatory to brew kvass at home, but these days almost everyone either fills up bottles at the tanks or buys readily available concentrate. Minted In FranceBY JOHN VINOCUR Chief of the Paris bureau.\nEventually, the laws of nostalgia and film production being what they are, someone in the United States is going to make a movie entitled ''The Egg Cream.'' By world standards, it will be a latecomer, because a French director, Diane Kurys, has already named a movie after an evocative soft drink.\nThe movie was called ''Diabolo Menthe,'' after a concoction that probably every urban Frenchman under 70 has tried and probably, even if secretly, very much liked. It is so common in Paris, and so teen-agerish, that no Frenchman would recommend it, any more than he'd say that you'd really ought to hurry over to visit the Eiffel Tower. So let an American do the suggesting: A sip of a diabolo menthe isn't only refreshing; as a sociological draught, it's more French than beaujolais.\nDiabolo menthes are made of mint syrup and limonade, which isn't lemonade at all, but a lemony soda water kept on tap in most French cafes. The taste of limonade is a bit like 7-Up or Sprite, and the mint syrup cools and cuts the sweetness. The result is a fresh and slightly acid mixture that, like the movie, evokes the 50's and 60's, a time before Coca-Cola took over France. But diabolo menthes have survived, and have spun off in every direction. There are also diabolo grenadines (with grenadine syrup), diabolo fraises (strawberry) and diabolo citrons (lemon). And in the penumbra of the real article, there is menthe a l'eau, which is just mint syrup and water, so cheap and basic that the cafe waiter may unilaterally decide it should be a Vittel menthe or Vichy menthe, thereby adding a brand-name mineral water and a few extra centimes to the bill.\nSo what. They're all good. Hibiscus On IceBY JUDITH MILLER Chief of the Cairo bureau.\nThe relentless dry heat of the Cairo sun results in permanently parched throats. Fortunately, Egyptian civilization has had about 7,000 years to develop antidotes for the condition.\nAmong the most popular is an ice-cold infusion called karkadeh (pronounced CAR- ca-day). It is made from the flowers of a scarlet hibiscus that grows in the Sudan and southern Egypt and is prepared somewhat like tea: A handful of dried flowers are thrown into a quart of water and boiled for three to five minutes, depending on the desired strength. The flowers are then strained out, leaving a rose-red brew. Sugar is added and the mixture is refrigerated overnight.\nKarkadeh is also drunk hot in the winter, particularly by those with upset stomachs and gastrointestinal problems. Egyptians also swear that it combats high blood pressure. (Hot, it tastes a little like wine punch; cold, it seems to be a cross between cranberry and grape juice.)\nDuring the heat of the day, or on a veranda in the evening, there is nothing quite as refreshing. It is nonalcoholic, which also appeals to this Moslem society.\nDried hibiscus flowers can be purchased in the United States in some spice sections of good stores. So you don't have to be Egyptian, or even in Egypt, to enjoy it. No. 1 in The OrientBY CHRISTOPHER S. WREN Chief of the Peking bureau.\nFor summertime refreshment, the Chinese still stick to tea or beer, but some Western expatriates in Peking have imported a drink that is popular in Hong Kong, and indeed in other corners of Asia where the British Empire has left its legacy.\nPimm's Cup No. 1 is a sweet gin-like alcoholic concoction imported from England. It is poured over crushed ice - anything from a jigger on up - and topped off with soda water. Theoretically, the drink should include a sprig of borage, but this plant is indigenous to Europe, so in Hong Kong a wedge of cucumber is substituted. Sometimes a sliver of lemon is also added.\nTraditionally, Pimm's Cup and soda tasted best if drunk while catching the breeze on the veranda of the grand old Repulse Bay Hotel on Hong Kong's Victoria Island. The hotel, alas, has been torn down, so the custom has been moved indoors into the cocktail lounges of the tonier downtown hotels, to the despair of those who also lament the demise of the pith helmet.\nIn Peking, Pimm's Cup is sometimes sold in the foreigners-only Friendship Stores (where domestically produced bottles of soda water and cucumbers are also available), to be taken away for sipping in private apartments or hotel rooms. Whether it is because the drink evokes the old colonial era or because it costs hard currency, one diplomatic devotee in Peking reported that he hadn't noticed it becoming popular with the Chinese comrades - yet. Valencia In MadridBY NINA DARNTON Contributor based in Madrid.\nA popular nonalcoholic summer drink served throughout Spain is the Valencian specialty, horchata. A sweet, cool summer pick- me-up, it is made from chufa, a tuber that yields a pale white liquid that looks something like coconut milk. To this is added water, sugar and cinnamon.\nFifteeen years ago, horchata could only be found in certain bars and restaurants, where it was made to order. Now the drink is so widely favored it is available everywhere and is even bottled and sold in supermarkets.\nThe most authentic traditional horchata in Madrid these days can be gotten in a small bar off the Grand Via called La Candela. In deference to the drink's Valencian origins, the bar is decorated with straw and rattan, Valencia's specialty, and behind the bar is a small shop that sells baskets and other such goods.\nThe horchata served here is the real stuff - homemade and delicious. You can ask for two varieties: ''liquida'' (straight and ice-cold) or ''mitad-mitad'' (half liquid and half chipped ice). La Candela serves only horchata and limon granizado, a sweetened fresh lemonade served over chipped ice.\nCitric Bliss on\nManila BayBY HENRY KAMM Chief of the Rome bureau.\nKalamansi juice is one of those rare titillaters of the palate that instantly suggest a unique place. And since that place is a tropical country dear to me, kalamansi juice, a great refresher in addition to its evocative power, is a cold drink that warms my heart. It exists, to my knowledge, only in the Philippines, an archipelago known, for some wrongheaded reasons, more for its shady sides than for its considerable beauties.\nKalamansi is one of the beauties. There is the melodious name, to begin with. The fruit that bears it is, like olives, rosebuds and pearls, tiny but marvelous. A lime- green skin encloses a citrus that achieves the miracle of combining within the miniature volume of a robin's egg the distinct flavors of lemons, oranges, tangerines and grapefruit, pink or yellow. It also contains more pits than one would think possible in so small and juicy a fruit, but Filipinos wrap the kalamansi - from which only the top has been sliced because it is too small to cut into the customary citrus halves - in cheesecloth before squeezing it over ice cubes and adding water and sugar.\nI have drunk kalamansi juice on most of the islands, from Luzon in the north to Tawi-Tawi down south in the Sulu Sea. But to truly savor this nectar of the gods needs the setting of the terrace of the Manila Hotel, with the sun performing its daily spectacular of vanishing into Manila Bay as that act would have been imagined by Cecil B. De Mille. Serve in\nA Salted GlassBY RICHARD J. MEISLIN Chief of the Mexico City bureau.\nAmericans think of the margarita as typically Mexican, but in fact it appears to be typically ''gringo,'' a coverup of the harsh taste of Mexico's popular - and powerful - cactus-based tequila for more sensitive American palates.\nThe classic margarita combines a shot of tequila, a half ounce of Cointreau, the juice of half a lime (Mexicans call these lemons) and cracked ice in a blender. It is served in a glass rimmed with a coating of coarse salt. It sounds easy to make, which leads one to wonder why so many of them in the United States are so awful.\nOne of the most expertly prepared margaritas in Mexico City can be found at Estoril, at Genova 75 in the Zona Rosa. It's a great prelude to some of the best food available in the capital, a Continental-style menu with Mexican accents. (Reservations are a must.) Fonda El Refugio, at Liverpool 166, serves superb Mexican fare and also has an adept hand with margaritas.\nIt has been said that the margarita was invented by a foreign wine taster who was intrigued by the taste of tequila and searched for complementary ingredients to make it softer on the palate. But according to Madrilena, S.A., a company that bottles a prepared version of the drink, the margarita was first mixed some 25 or 30 years ago in a now-forgotten bar in Tijuana, just across the border from California, by a woman named - you guessed it - Margarita.\nA Comradely ToastBY BRYAN MILLER Reporter in the Style section.\nIt seems curious that the French, who have a reputation for venerating wine, are so casual about diluting it with all sorts of other beverages.\nYears ago they started mixing white wine with cr eme de cassis to make a summer cooler called kir, a drink that has become immensely popular in the United States. Then they started the same with Champagne, causing serious consumers of the bubbly to blanch. When they started dumping orange juice and even Guinness stout into their goblets of muscadet, well, there was no end to the possibilities.\nIn the last few years in Lyons, just north of the C^otes du Rh^one and south of Beaujolais, another vinous concoction for summer has appeared - or, one should say, reappeared. Called a communard, it combines well-chilled red wine, usually beaujolais, with cr eme de cassis. Among the first places it was served were the two-star (in the Michelin Guide) restaurant Leon de Lyon and its sister establishment, Bistro de Lyon.\nAccording to Jean Paul Lacombe, the chef/owner of both restaurants, the name was a local epithet for communist. As he tells it, around the turn of the century communist activists in the Lyons area used to forgather in local bistros sipping this drink. ''People who didn't like them referred to them and the drink as 'communard','' Mr. Lacombe recalls. The word may have originated with the Paris Commune of 1871.\nFor many decades the drink fell out of favor, and no one ordered it. Now, however, many bistros in Lyons are again serving it, although not all the bartenders mixing it can explain its etymology. Pineapple Bubbly BY CLIFFORD D. MAY Chief of the Abidjan bureau.\nTo speak of summer drinks in most of West Africa is redundant. Judged by the sensibilities of a New Yorker, it is always summer here. Days come in two flavors: hot and hotter, with humidity the only real variable.\nIn such a torrid corner of the world, thirst is a constant. I have been almost equally grateful for a bottle of cold beer in Ouagadougou or a bowlful of tepid water from the tanned carcass of a goat (please retie the neck when you're finished) in the northern Chadian crossroads of Oum Chalouba.\nBut the most original and refreshing drink in the region is found only in the Ivory Coast, in Abidjan. It's called Cristelor and is described on the label as a ''delice d'ananas petillant,'' which translates as sparkling pineapple delight. Most people just call it pineapple champagne.\nThe beverage has only been available in the stores for about six months. ''The idea came to me about a year and a half ago to make a wine from pineapples,'' said Jean Konan Banny, the proprietor of Cristelor and the Ivory Coast's Minister of Defense.\nThe delice is nonalcoholic, made from pineapples with effervescence added. ''But that's all we add,'' said Mr. Konan Banny. ''We don't put in any sugar or any artificial ingredients. We don't try to make it all taste the same, either. Depending on the crop and the season, some bottles may be sweeter than others, or have a slightly different quality. I don't think people mind that.''\nMr. Konan Banny explained that alcoholic pineapple wines are being produced experimentally, but are not yet available to the public. To that end, he said, a champagne vintner, with 40 years' experience, has been recruited from France. In the meantime, residents of Abidjan have taken to mixing Cristelor with vodka, gin or rum. At Mr. Konan Banny's suggestion I also tried mixing it with scotch and found the combination surprisingly successful.\nMr. Konan Banny hopes eventually to be able to export his pineapple soft drink and wines. ''That will take a little time,'' he said. ''We'll need to learn to stabilize them so they can travel.''\nAsked why its called Cristelor, Mr. Konan Banny said that, too, was his idea. ''It's for my granddaughter,'' he explained. ''Her name is Cristel.''\nLemonade Times TenBY MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN Chief of the Ottawa bureau.\nThere are in this world many different kinds of hot; island hot, desert hot, city hot and steamy jungle hot, and in my experience the hottest of them all is June-in-New-Delhi hot. Planters punches or rock shandies, which would do quite nicely in any of the lesser hots, are irrelevant when crows fall out of the sky with heatstroke. At best, such libations are like bouquets for the condemned - delightful in themselves but not likely to change anything that matters. When the temperature settles around the 110-degree mark and dust congeals, making the air a shimmering colloid, there is only one remedy, nimbu pani, which translates as lime water, or its carbonated equivalent, nimbu soda.\nWhat we are talking about here is a 10 or 12 times a day drink that restores dehydrating fluids and at times stimulates the will to move and live. It is imbibed in various versions from the Khyber Pass to Bangladesh, but surprisingly is unknown anywhere else. The drink bears the same relation to lemonade as the Bengal tiger does to a house cat.\nThe basic ingredient is, of course, the juice of limes, but the limes in questions are tiny Indian limes that are enormously more sour than limes grown elsewhere. The juice of these fruits, diluted with water or soda by a factor of 20- or 30-to-1 will cause the stiffest of stiff upper lips to purse. Those Indian households that have refrigerators have jars of freshly squeezed nimbu juice at the ready at all times.\nWater or soda is added for the basic drink which is ordered in restaurants as nimbu water or soda, plain. There is also nimbu water or soda, sweet, which is the same drink served with sugar syrup, and nimbu water or soda, salty, or more usually ''saltish,'' which is the basic sour drink sprinkled with a good deal of salt, which some people insist is healthier.\nIn the dry hot season in Delhi, which is longer than the wet hot season, I found solace in nimbu sodas, plain, and I have missed them ever since. It is, however, probably germane to note that there are many Indians who believe that the best drink in hot weather is hot tea, with one such fellow once explaining that when you ''are heating your insides you are cooling your outsides.''\nAnd there are also those who recommend lassi, a drink made of yogurt and water and spices, which like the Indian lime drinks can be ordered, ''plain, sweet or saltish.'' On Tap In CanadaBY DOUGLAS MARTIN Chief of the Toronto bureau.\nCanadian drinking habits are hardly unfamiliar to Americans: The two fastest growing brands of beer are Budweiser and Miller, while gin and tonic is the rule from Cape Breton to Vancouver Island. Even iced tea is slowly creeping northward from the American South.\nBut if the drinks aren't that different, the drinking places are. Saloons represent one of this northern nation's most intriguing artifacts. Called ''beverage rooms'' in the Maritimes, ''brasseries'' in Quebec, ''taverns'' in Ontario and ''pubs'' in British Columbia, working-class bars are good places to catch a glimpse of a Canada tourists don't automatically see.\nNot all have moose heads on the wall, but most lack New York-style bars. The Canadian pattern is a sea of separate tables. (If you sit at one for a while, people will talk to you.) Most regulars order draft beer by holding up two or three fingers (almost never just one) to signal the number of glasses they want.\nAll things considered, drink the beer. Canadian beer, even Canadian-brewed Budweiser and Miller, is stronger and tastier than American brands. Molson's Export, an ale, is the favorite of the he- men; Labatt's Blue is nice on American tastebuds, and the special beers of the Maritimes - Moosehead, Schooner and the like - are a treat on a hot day. If you can't decide, just hold up two or three fingers and two or three of something nice will be delivered. Wine of\nThe CountryBY PAUL ANASTASI Contributor based in Athens.\nTravelers to Greece will often find themselves parched and longing for refreshment after only a few hours under the country's hot summer sun. There are two simple drinks, both lightly alcoholic, that offer more than just temporary respite from this thirst. One is ouzo, anise flavored and served pretty much as it comes out of the bottle; the other is a fruit- filled spritzer made with retsina, the cheap white or red table wine that takes its name from the pine resin with which it is flavored.\nOuzo can either be drunk straight, perhaps cooled by an ice cube, or diluted with water and ice to the point where only the strong aroma remains. It is not only refreshing as a drink but is a favorite accompaniment to mezes, Greek appetizers. It is cheap and always available in establishments ranging from the simplest taverna to the most exclusive restaurant.\nThe retsina cooler is popular with foreign residents, but has not yet established itself locally. The ingredients are available in almost any restaurant or cafe, but the traveler may have to assemble them himself. Just ask for ice-cold (''pagomeno'') retsina - the kind in barrels is usually preferable to the bottled - add cold soda water to it in any proportion desired and toss in a few slices of ripe fruit - perhaps peaches or pears. The result is a fruity, fizzy drink. Enjoy the refreshment and ignore the stares.",

    "text": "GERMANY'S GUEST WORKERS\n1984-08-19T05:00:00.000Z\nADAPTED FROM THE BOOK ''THE CROWDED EARTH'' BY PRANAY GUPTE. PUBLISHED THIS MONTH BY W.W. NORTON AND COMPANY INC. COPYRIGHT c 1984 BY PRANAY GUPTE. REPRINTED WITH PERMISSION OF THE AUTHOR.\nPranay Gupte, a former New York Times foreign correspondent, is the author of ''The Crowded Earth: People and the Politics of Population,'' from which this article is adapted. ON AN ORDINARY afternoon at the bustling Turkish bazaar inside the old S-Bahnhof in West Berlin, Ehmet Tutkoli waited for customers at his shoeshine booth. Throughout the former train station on Bulowstrasse, the din of Oriental music rose from the dozen or so stores selling cassettes, and the aroma of strong coffee blended with that of fresh-baked baklava. Children darted about, occasionally chased by their mothers, wearing patterned scarves and large billowing dresses, or yelled at by their fathers, languidly playing chess or checkers in coffee stalls.\nA short, broad-jawed man about 40 years old, with dark eyes and a formidable mustache, Tutkoli wore a scruffy sweater, a tweed jacket whose buttons were missing, baggy trousers and an absurd woolen cap that kept slipping off his thick black hair. Tutkoli owned one of those antique shoeshine stands ornamented with brasswork, wooden carvings and mother-of-pearl handles. With a gap-toothed smile, he offered passers-by a shoeshine for the equivalent of 50 cents. It was an offer I gladly accepted, and as Tutkoli stroked his brushes and snapped his chamois over my shoes, we talked, in a mixture of English, German, Turkish and pantomime.\nHe would soon be going home to Ankara, Tutkoli said, because the West Germans did not want people like him around anymore. Until recently, the Government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl was offering foreigners without ''valid'' jobs about $3,600 per adult and $500 per child to leave the country. Tutkoli had lost his job as a mechanic in an auto repair service when the West German economy went into recession, throwing more than two million Germans out of work by the end of 1983. He said he was planning to take Kohl up on his offer.\nA fellow Turk had given him his spare shoeshine stand, and Tutkoli set up shop in the old train station. He started work there in the late morning after putting in a couple of hours shining shoes on the Kurf\"urstendamm, West Berlin's main thoroughfare. His work space cost him nothing, although Tutkoli occasionally gave money to the man who donated the stand. All told, Tutkoli took home the equivalent of $400 each month. He did not apply for welfare benefits, which would have brought him food subsidies and health allowances, lest he risk deportation. Tutkoli's wife, Tasleem, brought in another $300 worth of marks as a cleaning woman in a hotel. Together they supported five children, as well as his parents in Ankara. As a mechanic, Tutkoli claimed he had earned six times his current income.\n''We were invited in by these Germans when they had a need for us,'' Tutkoli said bitterly. ''They made full use of us to build their economy, and now they want to kick us out. They are making life extremely unpleasant for us here. There are anti-Turkish marches, our women are molested, our children are abused and beaten up. What kind of a life is this for us?'' Ehmet Tutkoli is one of 1.5 million Turks in West Germany and one of about two million foreign ''guest workers,'' or Gastarbeiter . Along with their families, foreign-born residents number 4.5 million, or 7.4 percent of a population that includes almost 57 million native-born Germans. These workers are in the metallurgy in- dustry (mostly in welding), civil engineering, the hotel and restaurant business, the textile industry and unskilled jobs. Few foreigners hold top-paying jobs; most do the menial or manual tasks that most Germans ordinarily shun. Turks are the largest group of guest workers; others are from Italy, Yugoslavia, Greece, Portugal, Spain, Tunisia and Morocco. According to Government records, Asian workers include 23,000 Indians, 15,000 Pakistanis, 12,000 Filipinos, 9,000 South Koreans and about 16,000 Sri Lankans.\nIn West Berlin alone, there are 119,000 Turks, accounting for 6 percent of the city's nearly two million residents. Partly because of their language, their Moslem religion and a tendency to live mostly among their own, the Turks do not integrate easily. Like Tutkoli, many have decided to return home, and last year tens of thousands left the country.\nForeign workers, especially the Turks, have become natural targets for unemployed Germans, who feel that they are competing with Auslanders , the foreign born, for public housing, welfare benefits and jobs. (Fifteen percent of the foreigners are said to be unemployed, and more than 115,000 of these - or about 40 percent - are Turks.)\n''There is a new, ugly mood in Germany, and the foreign guest workers seem to be the victims,'' says Klaus Stiebler, a foreign-affairs analyst at West German Radio in Cologne. ''Germany invited them over when there was a real shortage of manpower in our burgeoning industries. There were plenty of jobs to go around then - I'm speaking of 15, 20 years ago, and even as recently as 10 years back. But these are different times. Germany, like many other countries of the West, is in economic difficulties. These Turks and other foreign workers who came here are really guests who didn't go home. And Germans are beginning to say that these\npeople have overstayed their welcome. It's a dismaying situation, and potentially explosive indeed.''\nMany Germans also have been concerned that while the indigenous population of West Germany has been experiencing zero growth, or even negative growth, the Turkish population, for one, was booming, as it did in the 1970's. In recent years, however, the Turkish birthrate has leveled and is showing signs of declining, along with that of other foreign residents. Still, some social commentators have worried aloud about the impact of the foreign birthrate on Germany's intrinsic racial and cultural character.\nYet a recent study by West Germany's Center for Political Education asserts that the country, far from being hurt by the continued presence of guest workers, could not survive without them. The study, widely circulated among top Government officials, industrialists, journalists and academics, warned of ''mounting racism in West Germany, based on prejudices and a profound ignorance of the importance of foreign workers to the national economy.''\nAfter the devastation of Europe during World War II, West Germany and other countries actively recruited migrant workers to rebuild roads and houses, serve in restaurants and hotels, work in automobile and electronics factories, haul garbage and keep the streets clean. Today, in the aftermath of worldwide recession, many in Western Europe want their foreign help to go home.\nIn West Germany not long ago, thousands of German youths marched through the predominantly Turkish ghetto of Kreuzberg in West Berlin, smashing shop windows and taunting residents. ''Send them back home and give their jobs to unemployed Germans'' was a theme often sounded during the 1983 national election campaign. Newspapers and television have continually highlighted the issue of guest workers.\nIn other countries, migrants from former colonies and protectorates have become the main targets for frustrations. France is on uneasy terms with its more than four million foreign-born residents, including Algerians, Portuguese and Moroccans, who constitute about 8 percent of France's overall population. In Britain, resentment has built up over the influx from the West Indies, Pakistan, Bangladesh and India; riots have taken place even in usually sedate British communities. Surinamese and Indonesian immigrants have encountered discrimination in the Netherlands. In Sweden, social resentment has been directed at Yugoslav and Turkish workers.\nSoon after Helmut Kohl became Chancellor in 1982, he formed a commission to define what he called a ''humane immigration policy.'' Kohl said such a policy should be based on integrating foreigners into German society, limiting how many foreigners would be admitted to settle in the country and providing economic incentives for guest workers and their families who wished to return to their homelands.\nThe commission consisted of officials from agencies most directly involved with guest workers - the Federal Ministries of Education, the Interior, and Labor - and representatives from the 11 Federal states. The commission's 200-page report, unveiled on March 2, 1983, endorsed all of Kohl's initial objectives and went on to recommend stricter regulations on the hiring of foreigners by German companies, the inflow of guest workers' families and ''extremist'' groups composed of foreigners. (Government estimates suggest that about 122,000 of West Germany's Turks, Yugoslavs, Portuguese, Spaniards, Tunisians, Moroccans and Italians belong to groups espousing radical politics, although most of these are concerned with issues back home, not with West Germany.)\nKohl's commission, whose recommendations were put into effect late last year, declared that before foreigners were given permanent residence, they should be certified fluent in German; they should not be wanted for crimes in their native countries; they should have adequate living quarters and guaranteed jobs with adequate pay, and their children should have access to proper educational facilities.\nIn contrast to the system in the United States, where children born of\nforeign residents are automatically eligible for citizenship, children born to foreign workers in West Germany are subject to the same visa and registration restrictions as their parents. If they wish to become citizens, they must apply. According to German officials, most foreign workers prefer permanent resident alien status to citizenship.\nOne question on which members of the immigration commission failed to agree was whether guest workers' families should be allowed to join them. The widespread perception among West Germans and other Western Europeans is that guest workers bring over not only their wives and children, but their extended families as well. The Christian Democrats want to prohibit foreign workers from bringing over children above the age of 6, basing this on the belief that older children are unable to assimilate properly in a foreign culture and tend to become misfits who later burden the state's social-welfare system. Members of the opposition parties as well as liberals have criticized this position, arguing that it violates human rights. These critics want to keep present legislation allowing foreign workers to bring in children up to the age of 16.\nHeinrich Lummer, West Berlin's deputy mayor and chief official in charge of internal affairs, clearly thinks the Turks should not be in West Germany at all. He supports the proposal to deny entry to immigrants' children above the age of 6.\n''Our main problem is the big number of foreigners in West Berlin,'' Lummer says in his ornate office in a prewar Government building on the John F. Kennedy Platz. ''Just imagine - 250,000, or 12 percent of West Berlin's population, are foreigners. The Turks are very proud of their own religion and cultural customs, and they are not ready to integrate into German society or to become full-fledged Germans. We must find a way to limit the numbers of these foreigners.\n''If these Turks live here for a long time, Germany will change as a result,'' Lummer continues. ''And there will soon come a time when major social conflicts occur as a result.''\nThe debate over the question of how many children foreign workers should be allowed to bring with them, and up to what age, will continue in view of West Germany's negative growth rate. Hermann Schubnell, professor of demography at the University of Mainz and a former director of the Federal Institute of Population Research, points out that for a variety of reasons, millions of couples in Western Europe decided in the late 1960's and 1970's to have fewer children, This tendency was most marked, he says, in West Germany, where the annual number of births fell from more than one million in the mid- 1960's to just over 600,000 in 1982. Moreover, the number of marriages each year in West Germany is also declining, with fewer than 362,000 in 1982, as compared with 445,000 in 1970. Schubnell and other experts believe that if the trend persists, the country's net population - excluding foreigners - of 57 million in 1983 will fall to 52.1 million by the year 2000. Most of the migrants are still in their early-to-middle childbearing years and come from countries where large families are traditional. In West Berlin, the number of babies born each year to Turkish, Yugoslav and Greek workers is proportionately higher than those born to German West Berliners; of the 18,000 births in 1983, almost 4,000 were to foreigners.\nAccording to Government statistics, the number of foreign schoolchildren in West Germany increased from 165,000 in 1976 to almost 700,000 in 1983. Government figures also show that nearly 60 percent of these students are Moslem. In West Berlin, one out of every four schoolchildren is of foreign ancestry.\nIn a book entitled ''Migrant Workers in Western Europe and the United States,'' Jonathan Power, a columnist for the International Herald Tribune, wrote: ''Perhaps the most intractable problem posed by the new migrant settlement patterns is the arrival on the labor market (and in the unemployment queues) of . . . immigrant children, who were either born in the host country, or arrived at an early age. Youngsters seeking work tend to get a raw deal, both from their inexperience and from their foreignness (even those born in the country). Yet at the same time, they tend to assimilate the rising expectations of the country's own youth, and refuse to do the type of work which first attracted their parents' generation.\n''This conflict between rising expectations and diminishing opportunities is generally recognized, in every country with a sizable foreign population, as one of the most acute social, political and economic significance for the future.''\nIn West Germany, this future has already arrived and has brought with it social tensions that worry officials, planners and social thinkers. ''We now have to do everything possible to increase our population,'' says Peter Petersen, a member of the West German Parliament. Petersen noted that in East Germany, a working woman who has a second child gets such benefits as 90 percent of a full year's paid leave. (With a population of some 16 million, East Germany has the worst labor shortage of the countries in the Soviet bloc.)\nKreuzberg is the sad, decaying neighborhood that houses most of West Berlin's Turkish community. Some of its buildings, especially those constructed before 1945, were long ago scheduled for demolition, but when the migrant workers arrived, creating a housing shortage, the authorities allowed them to move in for little or no rent. Kreuzberg's streets are littered with garbage. Only movie posters and the wash hanging on clotheslines lend color to the area. There is a preponderance of coffee shops, each crowded with unshaven men engaged in conversation or playing checkers, and there are several shabby restaurants commonly featuring lamb kebabs. Youths stand idly about on street corners, cadging cigarettes from foreigners.\nKreuzberg is possibly one of the worst of the decaying areas in West Berlin, but for Moustapha Arsat it represented the end of the rainbow when he was eking out a living 15 years ago on his family farm in Van, in eastern Turkey. Arsat came into Germany via East Berlin in those long-gone days when it was possible to take a cheap flight into East Germany, then walk into West Berlin at Checkpoint Charlie.\nArsat's uncle, Echmat Ali, had already established himself in West Berlin as a part- time coffee-shop owner in Kreuzberg and as a full-time janitor in a commercial building on Potsdamerstrasse. Ali's letters home boasted of how much money he was making and how well his wife and three children lived in a flat. A decade in West Berlin, Ali wrote, and Arsat could save enough to set himself up for life back home in Turkey. Arsat left Turkey, and his uncle put him to work first as a waiter in his shop and later as a sweeper in a bank.\nA dozen years have passed since Arsat arrived, and he has not returned to visit Van, so afraid is he of not being allowed back into Germany. His fear is irrational, for he has a valid visa. He has just turned 40; his sons, who are in their early teens, and his wife live with him in Kreuzberg. His uncle returned to Turkey a couple of years ago, bought himself a small hotel in Istanbul and writes that he is doing fine. Arsat has taken over Ali's coffee shop, but he is not so sure he wants to go back home.\nArsat has decided he could not possibly make enough on the family farm. His annual income now exceeds $20,000. ''What future do I have back in Turkey?'' he asks. Implicit in his question is a recognition that the Turkish economy is doing poorly. Nearly 20 percent of Turkey's labor force is unemployed, and the country's foreign debts are well over $20 billion. West Germany may want its guest workers to go home, but Turkey, whose expatriates each year send home more than $2 billion in much- needed foreign exchange, doesn't especially want them back.\nArsat's life is well-ordered. His wife prepares the snacks that they sell in their coffee shop. His sons, Selim and Mehmet, attend Koran classes at a neighborhood mosque and help out at the shop after school. At home, the Arsats have a video cassette recorder to view the latest Turkish movies. The Arsats, who frequently invite their countrymen over for huge meals of feta cheese, lamb kebabs, lentils, sheep's liver, thick yogurt and baklava, confine their socializing to Kreuzberg, and they have no wish to move elsewhere. Where else in the city can they find a five-room apartment renting for less than $100 a month? Arsat and his family all speak good German, and he thinks that one day he will become a West German citizen. He also hopes his sons will want to stay in West Germany.\nReflecting on Kohl's offer to give foreign workers about $3,600 to go home, Arsat snorts: ''What kind of offer is that? Do you think it is enough money for us to go back home and make a fresh start?''\nSpokesmen for immigrants' organizations have expressed concern that the Kohl plan could be the beginning of a forced repatriation program. Norbert Bl\"um, Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, vehemently denies this, saying the Government ''will never deviate from the principle of free choice.''\nBlum contends that if the unemployed Gastarbeiter were to leave, assimilation for their brethren left behind would be easier. Yet little serious discussion in West Germany has occurred over what sort of changes in the social structure would be necessary for ''guest workers'' to become plain ''workers.''\nBarbara John heads the newly established Bureau for Foreigners' Affairs in West Berlin. The walls of her brightly lighted suite of offices are festooned with colorful posters depicting happy Germans playing or chatting with equally happy foreigners, perhaps Turks. Some of the posters are captioned, ''We must talk to each other.'' The agency was set up two and a half years ago by the city government to help foreigners with housing, discrimination and unemployment problems.\nThe agency chief says she receives two to three dozen foreigners every day. She also appears frequently on radio and television programs to urge Germans to work for more understanding with the city's new immigrants.\n''We have to recognize in this country that the very people who are helping us sustain our modern development, the foreigners, are having great difficulties in integrating,'' she says. ''This may be due to their low socioeconomic status. But they suffer discrimination, whether in jobs or in housing. We must give the Turks and other foreigners the security that they are truly wanted in our society - that although they are a minority, they are still very much part of German society.''\nBarbara John goes to Turkish homes to discuss problems and often visits Germans who might have disputes with nearby Turkish families, sometimes accompanied by Cemalettin Cetin, a former Turkish journalist who runs a social-service organization for Turks.\n''There are few problems that cannot be resolved through mediation,'' Cetin says, offering guests to his office strong Turkish coffee and a richly sweet honey cake that his German wife baked. ''But so many people just don't bother to listen to one another.''\nCetin drove me to the home of Mehmet and Seriban Erki on Grunewaldstrasse. The Erkis live in an old, high-ceilinged apartment building in a neighborhood of leafy trees and parks. Erki works for the West German telephone company, and his wife is a cleaning woman at the local government office. They are in their late 30's and have four children. The Erkis told me they have no intention of returning to Turkey.\nTheir oldest daughter, 14- year-old Hanim, was asked whether she felt different at her school.\n''Different?'' she replied. ''Why should I feel different? I was born in Germany. I am German.''\nAs she spoke, the doorbell rang, and Ilse Vorpagel, a German neighbor, dropped in to visit.\nWhat did the neighbor think of Germany's ''Turkish problem''?\n''I have no Turkish problem,'' Ilse Vorpagel answered. ''Why should I? Turks are people, just like everyone else. If Turks are willing to resettle in Germany and integrate, then we should make it possible for them to do this. Germany needs the cultural diversity they bring.''",

    "text": "INDIRA GANDHI, SKILLED IN USES OF POWER, DOMINATED INDIA FOR TWO DECADES\n1984-10-31T05:00:00.000Z\nShe was sometimes called the Empress of India and sometimes a dictator and sometimes Mataji, the big mother. Whatever the epithet, Indira Gandhi was clearly the dominant figure in India for two decades, a woman who attracted controversy and was skilled in the uses of her vast power.\n She grew up in the shadow of her father, Jawaharlal Nehru, and stunned almost everyone by her emergence as a tough, shrewd and ruthless woman of commanding presence and absolute will. She maintained for many years that power did not interest her.\n''I like being Prime Minister, yes, but not more than I liked the other jobs I have done in my life,'' she said in 1973. ''I am not ambitious. I don't care for honors.'' That was two years before she briskly assumed dictatorial powers, in response to what seemed a threat to her strength, and espoused the tenets of authoritarian rule, from suspension of civil liberties to censorship of the press. Then, demonstrating that India's familiar label as the world's largest democracy was not just a cliche, the voters of India swept her out of office and, 18 months later, voted her back into power again.\nHer critics charged that her promises to erase poverty were quixotic and that India's chronic and severe problems of food shortages, malnutrition, population growth, illiteracy and exploitation by landlords actually burgeoned during her years of power. They said, too, that she tolerated corrupt ministers and fostered corruption in her younger son, Sanjay; that she was hungry for power and surrounded herself with inept advisers rather than brook potential rivals. Empty ''sloganizing'' and indecision, they said, had bred cynicism.\nAs a private person, Mrs. Gandhi seemed aloof, chilly, complex, giving no clue in her withdrawn, quiet personality as to why her public figure should appeal as it did to many millions of Indians. She could be rude, sometimes opening letters and signing papers when foreigners visited her in the red sandstone Indian Parliament or the nearby South Block of the secretariat. Seemed Lonely and Isolated \nAt other times, she gave the impression of shyness and vulnerability. She was physically frail. She had suffered from tuberculosis, low blood pressure, kidney problems and muscle spasms in the neck and had ignored doctors' orders not to have children. She worked 14 hours a day and seemed lonely and isolated.\nOne of the most detailed and widely discussed criticisms of Mrs. Gandhi in the years before her takeover of the Government came in 1974 from G. B. Verghese, a former press adviser to the Prime Minister and the widely respected editor of The Hindustan Times. Mr. Verghese called her ''strangely paralyzed, unwilling to lead, afraid of her own majority.'' ''The Prime Minister has no program, no world view, no grand design,'' he said. ''Thus, bereft of a frame, she has largely reacted to events and failed to shape them. This has been her tragedy. She lacks economic and administrative expertise. Nevertheless, she has a certain political instinct and charisma which would have been the greater assets if harnessed to a greater purpose. She has a mandate but no mission.'' Angered by Criticism \nMrs. Gandhi did not conceal her anger at these attacks. ''This is one of the countries in the world where the economy, although under severe strain, is not collapsing,'' she said to a journalist in 1974. ''Do you think it is easy to keep a country like India united? You say promises are not kept. I assert with all authority: Who in the world has kept more promises?'' \nHowever vague her destinations may have seemed, Mrs. Gandhi was always clear about her conviction that she was meant to lead India. She rarely indulged in self-analysis and usually brushed aside questions about her failed marriage, her personal life, her possibly difficult role as the daughter of the nation's first Prime Minister.\n''Every position has advantages and disadvantages,'' she once observed. ''I had an advantage because of the education my father gave me and the opportunities of meeting some great people, not only politicians, but also writers, artists and so on. But in politics one has to work doubly hard to show one is not merely a daughter but is also a person in her own right.''\nShe added, ''Of course, being a woman you have to work twice as hard as a man.'' Politics Permeated Childhood \nIndira Priydarshini (the second name means ''Dearly Beloved'') was born Nov. 19, 1917, the only child of Jawaharlal Nehru and his wife, Kamala, in Allahabad in northern India. Her grandfather, Motilal Nehru, who owned the house in which they lived, was a brilliant lawyer who discarded a lucrative practice to ally himself with Mohandas K. Gandhi and the Congress Party in the independence movement.\nBy all accounts, the child's early years were painfully lonely. The house served as a headquarters for the freedom struggle; her parents were frequently taken off to jail; the police were constantly there.\nWhat made her childhood even more difficult was the contemptuous treatment given her mother, Kamala, by the far more Westernized and sophisticated women of the Nehru family. Mrs. Gandhi in later life indicated that her own fluency in Hindi, far better than her father's, and her ''Indianness,'' or ability to think and feel as a Hindu Indian, were largely a legacy of her mother. When asked once about the impact of Kamala Nehru on her personality, Mrs. Gandhi replied, ''I saw her being hurt and I was determined not to be hurt.'' Strong Father-Daughter Bond \nIn her turbulent childhood - erratic schooling in India and Switzerland, followed by involvement in the independence struggle as a courier and demonstrator - she knew her father chiefly through the famous letters he wrote from a succession of prison cells. The letters, now collected, gave a capsule history of the world from Buddha to Stanley Baldwin and forged a strong link between father and daughter.\n''They were the only companionship I had with my father,'' she recalled. ''That is why I valued them so much.''\nHer formal schooling remained sporadic; she spent three unhappy years at a formal boarding school in Poona and in 1934 went to the university at Santiniketan (Abode of Peace) in West Bengal, founded by Rabindranath Tagore, the Nobel Prize-winning poet and philosopher. It was a brief, almost idyllic experience for the young woman in the unconventional school, where she studied poetry and the Manipuri style of classical Indian dancing. A British Education \nKamala Nehru died the following year. In 1937, Indira enrolled at Somerville College, Oxford, where she studied public and social administration, history and anthropology. Although she was in poor condition physically - she was ordered to spend several months in Switzerland to recover from pleurisy - Indira was active in the student wing of the British Labor Party and enrolled as a Red Cross volunteer when World War II began, even working briefly as an ambulance driver in the blitz. \nIn 1941, however, with the Indian independence movement nearing an apparent confrontation with the British, she sailed home with Feroze Gandhi, a newspaperman from Allahabad, who had worked in the Congress movement. He was a childhood friend of Indira, but her family was shocked when she announced, on arriving home, that she and Mr. Gandhi - who was not related to Mohandas Gandhi - planned to marry.\n''Nobody wanted that marriage, nobody,'' she recalled many years later. Mr. Gandhi was of a different religion; she was a Hindu, he was a Parsi, which meant that ''the whole of India was against us.'' But she and Feroze Gandhi were married in March 1942. By September of that year, they were both sent to prison by the British. In fact, the only real domestic period of their troubled marriage was between 1943 and 1946, when they lived in relative quiet in Allahabad. A son, Ranjiv, was born in 1944, and another, Sanjay, in 1946.\nThat year Nehru became Prime Minister of a provisional Government as a prelude to full Indian independence, and Mrs. Gandhi became his official hostess. He enjoyed parties and travel; Mrs. Gandhi was dutiful, almost reluctant. Later, she recalled that she had disliked socializing and making small talk. ''It took me a long time to get over this. But I had to learn to enjoy it, so I did.'' Gandhi Marriage Crumbles \nS As she grew closer to her father, and his demands on her grew with his prominence, the Gandhi marriage crumbled and the couple began to live apart. Feroze Gandhi went on to become an outspoken member of Parliament; he died in 1960. \nAs her father's confidante and companion, Mrs. Gandhi traveled at his side abroad and at home and became a familiar, if somewhat diffident, figure to millions of Indians. Her first step toward national stature took place in 1955, when she was elected to the 21- member Congress Party working committee. It was a small step, and she remained withdrawn and self-conscious, but it marked her first move toward an independent political identity. \nFour years later, she was named president of the party, obviously because she was the daughter of Nehru, then at the peak of his power. Yet she herself, then 42, was beginning to emerge as a favorite of the impatient younger members of the party, which was dominated by aging men linked only by the bond of having fought together against the British during India's long struggle for independence. Begins to Show Toughness \nDuring her 11 months as president, she began to display toughness and political assertiveness. She was influential in the ouster of the Communist government in the southern state of Kerala. \nDespite her success, she turned down the offer of another term, partly because of concern about her father's health and partly because she realized that she was not yet senior enough to run the party as she wanted.\nIn May 1964 Nehru died of a stroke. Mrs. Gandhi went into a period of silent withdrawal for weeks, tending to burst into tears whenever a friend tried to offer condolences. Lal Bahadur Shastri, the new Prime Minister, offered Mrs. Gandhi a Cabinet post; she chose the relatively nonprestigious job of Minister of Information and Broadcasting and did a lackluster job.\nBut in 1966, when Mr. Shastri died suddenly, the Congress Party's leaders chose Mrs. Gandhi as Prime Minister. There were two key reasons: First, they felt that she would be pliable and, second, they wished to avoid the obvious choice, Morarji R. Desai, whose career would be intertwined with that of Mrs. Gandhi years later. Uncertain Leadership at First \nHer first year of leadership was one of uncertainty, although she did make some strong moves, such as dividing the Punjab and proposing that the commercial banks be nationalized, which was achieved in 1969. In 1967 India's 250 million voters returned the Congress Party to power by a narrow margin; the economy had sunk into a deep recession and the failure of the monsoon for the second consecutive year threatened millions in northeast India with starvation, which was averted by American grain shipments.\nMrs. Gandhi was jolted by the election results, although she had found, to her surprise, that campaigning buoyed her. The closeness of the election made it clear to her that she was the only nationally known and accepted leader for a party that needed streamlining. She promptly announced a 10-point program to bring about a socialist state with a stable economy.\nCongress became a divided party, with an older group forming around Mr. Desai and a younger, more radical faction gathering around Mrs. Gandhi. As the party breach widened, India's President died suddenly in May 1969. Although the position was one of a figurehead, the vacancy set the stage for a struggle for control of the party. \nThe party's elders saw a chance to humiliate Mrs. Gandhi by supporting a candidate who was a known foe. Mrs. Gandhi, gathering her supporters, backed another candidate, thus asking members of her own party to vote with her against their leadership. With the help of nearly two-thirds of the Congress members, her candidate won a narrow victory. It is believed likely that she knowingly precipitated the crisis by dismissing Mr. Desai as Deputy Prime Minister. Party Elders Expel Gandhi \nA few months later, the old guard leadership expelled Mrs. Gandhi from the party for ''grave acts of indiscipline.'' She brushed aside the gesture with characteristic contempt, calling it an illegal act by a group of discredited ''bosses'' and ''dictators'' who wanted to block her socialist programs. The next morning, the Congress Party bloc in Parliament gave her a vote of confidence. \nWith the party split and Mrs. Gandhi maintaining her populist stance, moving to nationalize the banks and eliminate the funds given to princely states, she abruptly called for elections in March 1971, a year ahead of schedule. She hoped to be able to increase her support, as the party split had left her with the backing of only a little more than 200 in the lower house of 525 members. After a 43-day campaign, Mrs. Gandhi emerged with a parliamentary victory of dimensions comparable to those of her father, with her wing of the party winning 350 seats. \nWhen civil war broke out that year in Pakistan, India supported East Pakistan in its fight against West Pakistan and was quickly victorious. East Pakistan became Bangladesh, and India became indisputably the dominant power on the Subcontinent. \nTwo years later, her popularity had plummeted. Her Government faced an economic crisis. Compounding the nation's misery were two severe droughts, inflation, oil-price increases in which she consistently defended the oil producers because they were ''exploited'' by Western nations, and poor planning, with development enmeshed in a web of bureaucracy. Charges of Corruption \nHer critics charged, moreover, that she had worsened the problems by misuse of authority, corruption and an erosion of moral leadership. She began to take steps that stirred uneasiness about her final intentions - using emergency measures to imprison strikers and dissident students without trial, taking over the small Himalayan protectorate of Sikkim.\n''There has never been any advice spoken to me that I needed much,'' she once said. ''What influenced me more were the lives of the people I lived with - my mother and my father. That didn't need words.''\nMrs. Gandhi denied repeatedly that she was a mere politician - indeed, she was reportedly even allergic to those two staples of political campaigning in her country, the perpetual dust and the wreaths of marigolds - and saw herself rather as the inevitable destined leader of India. This gave her an armor of disdain against the growing attacks of the opposition, and, it proved in mid-June 1975, fostered the impulses of an autocrat. Beginning of 1975 Crisis \nThe crisis began with the decision of a high court judge in Mrs. Gandhi's native Allahabad convicting her of two counts of electoral corruption - the specific charges included the use in her election campaign of the services of a Government official and of a rostrum - and declared her election to Parliament invalid. The ruling questioned her right to remain as Prime Minister and prohibited her from running in any election for six years. Not surprisingly, the opposition seized upon the ruling; despite her decision to appeal to a higher court, there was an immediate clamor for her to resign right away.\nBut she said there was ''no question'' of resignation. Instead, at dawn two days later, dozens of opposition leaders, including Mr. Desai, the Deputy Prime Minister, were arrested and taken to jail, and Mrs. Gandhi proclaimed a state of emergency. Acting under a law that was a holdover from British rule, the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, which bestowed sweeping and arbitrary powers on the Government, Mrs. Gandhi had first hundreds and then thousands of people arrested.\nAs her powers expanded, Mrs. Gandhi serenely ignored the protests, including demonstrations in which several people were killed. ''In India,'' she said, ''democracy has given too much license to people. Even today we are more democratic than any developing country in the world.'' 'Threat to Internal Stability' \nMrs. Gandhi, in this first statement after embarking on her authoritarian program, said she had taken the action in response to a ''threat to internal stability'' and hoped that it would be only temporary. At the same time, she outlined a program of economic changes that she said were designed to bring down prices and achieve a more equitable distribution of land. Critics said that the changes were in fact designed primarily to distract attention from what seemed to be a rapid movement toward a totalitarian state. Other critics, economists, saw the planned ''reforms'' as a patchwork of dubious value. \nLess than two months after Mrs. Gandhi assumed her new powers, more than 50,000 people were reportedly imprisoned, and Parliament changed the law under which she had been convicted in June. Another bill was passed that prevented her election from even being considered by the judiciary. 1976 Elections Postponed \nIn November, the Supreme Court dismissed the charges against Mrs. Gandhi, basing its ruling on the law passed about two months after her conviction that rewrote the election law so as to omit the offenses of which she had been found guilty. Few were surprised when at the end of December, the Congress Party announced that the elections scheduled for early 1976 had been postponed for a year ''in order to insure continuity in bringing about economic and political stability.''\nShe continued to deny that she had set the country on a course toward totalitarianism. ''Would you be here at all, if we were totalitarian?'' she asked her opposition in Parliament early in 1976, a rhetorical device that ignored that many members of the opposition were not there but in jail. \nThe shrunken opposition was unconvinced. India, said one opponent, had entered ''an era of darkness.''\nIt was an argument that sounded to many like nothing more than a justification for what was rapidly becoming a classic dictatorship. The next conference of her Congress Party, however, predictably called for the continuation of the state of emergency, and in February 1976 an obedient Parliament passed legislation giving the Government the power to suppress ''objectionable material'' in the press. 'Work More - Talk Less' \nThe hortatory banners and billboards that are so often a manifestation of an authoritarian regime now urged Indians ''Work More - Talk Less'' or ''Defeat the Design of Sabotage by Reactionary Forces'' or simply displayed Mrs. Gandhi's enlarged visage.\nIn foreign affairs, however, there were signs of change, of flexibility. The United States broke off scheduled talks on the resumption of economic aid to indicate displeasure with the continuing policies of repression, but by late April 1976, American diplomats were talking of vague signs of a ''thaw'' in the Government's attitude toward the United States.\nMeanwhile, the Government announced that it was sending an ambassador to China for the first time in 15 years, and as a further sign of a new amiability, proposed renewing talks with Pakistan with an eye to normalization of relations. Mrs. Gandhi went to the Soviet Union for a five-day visit after signing a new five-year agreement with Moscow that stressed commercial ties between the two countries.\nDomestically, there was no thaw, and Mrs. Gandhi showed no signs of qualms. In June 1976 the Government extended for one year its right to hold prisoners without trial or even formal charges, a step it said was taken ''for dealing with the emergency.'' India's Supreme Court, meanwhile, had upheld the Government's right to imprison political opponents without hearings. Not content, Mrs. Gandhi proposed in August further constitutional amendments that would give the executive branch, meaning herself, almost unlimited powers. Compulsory Sterilization Issue \nPerhaps as a sign of security, the Government allowed opponents to hold meetings to protest these changes in the country's Constitution, which they saw as basically codifying the state of emergency. Predictably, however, the amendments were approved by Parliament.\nOne significant domestic issue for Mrs. Gandhi was population control, particularly the question of compulsory sterilization, which was debated in Parliament throughout 1976. She announced that ''strong steps which may not be liked by all'' were under consideration, the sterilization program was pushed and the Government, in September, announced that civil servants were to be prohibited from having more than three children. This renewed emphasis on population control, along with rumors of compulsory sterilization, provoked sometimes violent protests and confrontation. But India in 1976 had the best birth control record in its history. \nOnce again, as the year neared an end, the Government announced that the scheduled elections had been postponed until early 1978, But in early January 1977, Mrs. Gandhi, in a surprise announcement, told the country that elections would be held in March because of her ''unshakable faith'' in the power of the people. Shortly afterward, Mrs. Gandhi released the last of the political opponents still being held.\nHer oppposition, she asserted, had only one issue, herself. The rapid advancement of her beloved younger son, Sanjay, also became an issue; he had been named to the executive committee of Congress's youth branch at the end of 1975. Voters Reject Mrs. Gandhi \nThe opposition to Mrs. Gandhi had a single theme, expressed by one banner as ''End Dictatorship, Dethrone the Queen.'' On March 20, 1977, the voters did just that, defeating Mrs. Gandhi and making Mr. Desai, whom she had imprisoned two years before, Prime Minister. Mr. Desai headed the Janata Party, the dominant factor in the loose anti-Congress coalition.\nThe Desai Government set up an investigative commission to look into the imposition of emergency rule, but Mrs. Gandhi declined to appear before it. ''The proclamation of emergency,'' she said, ''was a constitutional step, approved by the Cabinet and duly ratified by both houses of Parliament.'' Turns Detention Into Triumph \nIn October 1977, after being rebuffed in her efforts to reclaim the leadership of the Congress Party, Mrs. Gandhi was arrested on charges of official corruption. After a few hours in jail - she refused bail - she was ordered released by a magistrate who found no reasonable grounds for her detention. Turning the episode into a personal triumph, she immediately went on a three-day tour of western India; in Bombay, about 25,000 people turned out to greet her.\nHer arrest, she proclaimed, was ''to prevent me from going to the people,'' adding, ''It is an attempt to discredit me in their eyes and the eyes of the world.''\nIn early 1978, Mrs. Gandhi and her supporters broke away from the regular Congress Party and formed what was known as the Congress-I (for Indira) Party, or to its adherents, the ''real Congress'' party. Any reunion of the two factions, Mrs. Gandhi said, must be headed by her. Once again, as she campaigned through February in state election campaigns, huge crowds gathered. She herself won a by-election in a rural South Indian district later in the year. Battle Against Investigation \nHer battle not to testify before the investigative commission, and not to be tried for refusing to testify, dragged through the year. In May 1978, the commission concluded that the state of emergency had been declared fraudulently and administered arbitrarily. During the summer, the Government charged her with having illegally detained oppposition leaders and harassed officials during the emergency. Her son Sanjay was charged with having engaged in illegal demolition of private property.\nHer response was simple: ''Instead of solving the problems of the people, they are trying to divert attention.'' \nAs the vote in Parliament neared, riots exploded in several cities. After a seven-day debate, the vote on Prime Minister Desai's motion that she be expelled and jailed for the remainder of the session was 279 to 138. In a typical gesture of disdain, Mrs. Gandhi refused to leave the Parliament chamber and to go home ''to be arrested in the dead of night from my house,'' as so many of her opponents had been. A Dramatic Gesture \nShe insisted on waiting to be arrested in Parliament, and it was three hours before the arresting officers arrived. As they came she got up on a heavy table to offer friends the characteristic Hindu salutation, ''namaste,'' an inclination of the head over hands placed as if in prayer. Then she was led off. \nThrough the early months of 1979, her fortunes seemed at a low ebb, as pressure grew for investigations into various allegations made against her and Sanjay. The Congress Party was reunited, with its recently disaffected members, the Congress-I faction, merging again with the others. She said, uncharacteristically, that perhaps she had made mistakes and expressed regrets for ''hardships and inconvenience caused.'' Special courts were set up for her trials.\nBut the anti-Indira coalition was crumbling under the weight of its failure to resolve India's chronic crises and even more from internal politics, with Mr. Desai badly undermined by Charan Singh. Divide-and-Conquer Tactics \nIn July 1979 Prime Minister Desai resigned. Repeating her brilliant 1969 divide-and-conquer victory, Mrs. Gandhi threw her vital support behind Mr. Singh, another man she had once had thrown into prison, as Mr. Desai's successor. At about the same time, a survey showed her to be the single most popular political figure in India's major cities.\nJust as she had more or less created the Singh Government, so she destroyed it by making it clear that she and her followers would oppose a motion of confidence, possibly because Mr. Singh refused to dismiss the charges of corruption pending against her. Shortly after his Government fell, he returned as a caretaker Prime Minister until elections could be held in three months. \nWith elections ahead, Mrs. Gandhi worked hard making sure that she was returned to power, campaigning vigorously, forging alliances. In the elections of January 1980, she and her Congress Party won a sweeping victory, winning two-thirds of the seats in Parliament. \nEarly in the year, two cases pending against Mrs. Gandhi in special courts were canceled on technical grounds. Her power seemed secure, barely ruffled by growing murmurs that her younger son, Sanjay, was misbehaving. In June 1980, however, Sanjay - her open favorite - was killed in the crash of a small plane. Her control did not break, but few doubted that his death was a severe blow to the Prime Minister. Emergence of Rajiv Gandhi\nIn the years since Sanjay's death, his brother, Rajiv, emerged as their mother's chief political lieutenant. Now 39 years of age and a former airline pilot, he is the first among five general secretaries of the Congress-I (for Indira) Party.\nRajiv Gandhi, who was a diffident politician when first elected to his brother's seat in Parliament in 1981, gradually became more confident as his mother pushed him higher into the party's councils. By early this year he appeared to be in full command of the party's machinery as its leadership geared up for a new national election, which must be held before next Jan. 20.\nMrs. Gandhi's relations with opposition leaders continued to be prickly at best. In the last year Congress-I tried to topple several state governments hostile to it and to the Prime Minister. \nIn Andhra Pradesh near the southern tip of the Indian subcontinent, Mrs. Gandhi's allies appeared to have engineered the ouster in August of the state's Chief Minister, N. T. Rama Rao, a highly popular opponent of the Prime Minister. She denied any role in Mr. Rama Rao's removal, which was ordered by a Gandhi-appointed governor. After nationwide protests charging undemocratic practices, a new governor, also named by Mrs. Gandhi, reversed his predecessor's action and Mr. Rama Rao was permitted to form a new cabinet.\nAs of this fall, Mrs. Gandhi could count all but four of India's 22 state govenments in her camp, giving her a strong advantage in a national election. Criticism of her tactics against opposition parties has been balanced by popular approval of her swift action last June to quell an outbreak by Sikh terrorists in the northern state of Punjab. \nRated as Strong LeaderThus she remained, in the minds of many voters, a strong personal force for national unity. Early this year a poll taken by The Illustrated Weekly found 94 percent of the respondents rating her as an able national leader. \nHer stormy political life found an echo in her family relations in the last few years. In 1982 Sanjay's widow, Maneka, was evicted from the Prime Minister's house, where she had been living since her marriage to Mrs. Gandhi's younger son. \nThe feud intensified in July when Maneka announced that she would run against her brother-in-law, Rajiv, for his parliamentary seat from a constituency in Uttar Pradesh, the same district that Sanjay had represented before his death.\nAs the time neared when the Prime Minister would have to set a date for the election, speculation arose that Mrs. Gandhi might seek to postpone a vote if she felt she was not assured of victory.",

    "text": "RAJIV THE SON\n1984-12-02T05:00:00.000Z\nJoseph Lelyveld, a New York Times correspondent in India from 1966 to 1969, is a staff writer for The Times Magazine. ON THE FIRST DAY FOLLOWING THE PERIOD OF official mourning for the murdered Prime Minister, her sole surviving son and dynastic heir struck what he plainly intended to be a keynote for his new-old regime. In a television talk that had been written for him by a friend who happened to be an advertising man, he said: ''Our administrative system must become more goal- oriented. A new work ethic, a new work culture must be evolved in which the government is result-bound and not procedure-bound. Reward and punishment must be related to performance.'' The next day, meeting senior civil servants, he decried the ''unnecessary politicization of administration.'' Then, having raised his sails, he immediately called a national election.\nThe phrases that were found for 40-year-old Rajiv Gandhi were plucked from a different mental universe from the one his mother, Indira Gandhi, had inhabited. But what were they promising? A new ethic and a new culture in a country as old and tradition-bound as India? A managerial revolution from the top? That seemed a farfetched proposition, to put it mildly, and one that was unlikely to evoke much of a response in India's more than 530,000 villages. And what, really, did these imported platitudes have to do with the traumatic passage that Rajiv Gandhi personally, and India as a whole, had just made? How would ''goal-oriented'' administration ease the steadily deepening alienation of the Sikh minority or end the cycle of vengeance in the Punjab that had led directly to the assassination? What would a ''result-bound'' Indian government do in the field of population control? Would it preserve the parliamentary system?\nIntrusive questions along these lines missed the point that struck many Indians immediately. The new Prime Minister, they understood, was responding to hopes for a new start. Without being unfilial, he seemed to recognize that, whatever the grief for Indira Gandhi and the ghastly way her life ended, India was not mourning the era called the Indira Raj that had suddenly come to an end. It was looking less for continuity than for renewal.\nIndira Gandhi had related rewards and punishments strictly to political loyalty. She had systematically undercut parties and leaders - even leaders in her own party - when they threatened to establish a strong regional base. Venality worried her less than initiative; a politician obsessed with deals and payoffs was less of a threat to her increasingly narrow and personal sense of national leadership than a politician concerned with policies. Civil servants concerned with carrying out policies didn't long survive when they got in the way of politicians who had shown their loyalty. In this climate, politics increasingly became a matter of access to influence, and problems festered because decisions could not be made. The perennial problem of the Punjab thus became the crisis of the Punjab - and finally the tragedy of Indira Gandhi - not so much because basic, unreconcilable interests were in conflict but because factional political interests were permitted to forestall a resolution over a period of months, then years. It was, after all, a fatal management failure.\nAJIV GANDHI'S OWN ROLE IN THE PUNjab and present understanding of what went wrong there remain matters of intense speculation; his initial public statements as Prime Minister consistently avoided such questions and refused all requests for interviews during the mourning period. But, three years out of the cockpit of an Indian Airlines turboprop, he seemed to be signaling his impatience with the crassest features of his political inheritance. So far, he has offered only words, fresh new exhortations wrapped in muddled old exhortations - Indian political leaders sometimes seem to earn their living by exhorting - but Jawaharlal Nehru's grandson and Indira Gandhi's son was trying to come on as a reformer.\nThe widespread readiness to accept this largely unknown and wholly untested young dynast in those terms seemed to me to show the depth of the sense that things had gone very wrong with the institutions of Indian democracy before the assassination; to demonstrate how deeply many Indians wanted to believe in a possibility, any possibility, for reform. Watching him at the last rites for his mother, I wondered whether Indians would take this dignified, self-contained figure in a Gandhi cap and homespun pajamas to be a pudgier version of the young Nehru. He had, I thought, the sort of bland good looks that a Bombay movie director might look for if he were casting the part; and movies made in Bombay for the mass audience, I remembered, always have happy endings, occasionally by dint of reincarnation following a violent death. But the succession of Rajiv Gandhi was, obviously, no triumph for the democratic institutions his grandfather had nurtured. Indeed, his own commitment to democratic practices and institutions had to be taken on faith, as much as the assumption that he had the capacity to grow in the job.\nA reluctant politician, a neophyte in his third year in Parliament, the new Prime Minister was suddenly, as a result of his lineage, the single Indian among 730 million who could be said to have national standing as a political leader. This was a measure not only of his mother's dynastic ambitions but also of the shadow this withdrawn yet willful woman cast over Indian democracy during 15 out of the last 18 years, the years that she reigned as Prime Minister.\nThat was practically as long as her father had reigned. Before his death, the politicians and press had harped continually on the question: ''After Nehru, who?'' Three or four strong possibilities were usually mentioned; the name of his daughter seldom was. Then, after Indira Gandhi established her dominance, eliminating all possible rivals from her party and Government, she seemed such a permanent fixture that the question of a succession was seldom raised. But there were always her sons; first Sanjay, the ruthless young power broker who died in a plane crash in 1980, and then Rajiv, his elder brother, who, until the age of 36, never showed the slightest interest in the family business. Now, at a time when it was impossible to discount rumors that there were would-be assassins sworn to eliminate the new Prime Minister, there was no obvious answer if anyone thought to ask: ''After Rajiv, who?''\nThe dynasty had continued, but the dynasty was unlikely to be renewed for 25 years. Rajiv Gandhi has a wife, but she is Italian; he has a son and daughter, but they are adolescents. His Congress Party, held together until now by his mother's personality, would almost certainly disintegrate without him. Yet it remained the only Indian party with national strength facing a galaxy of regional opposition parties that have been chronically unable to present a stable alternative because of the competing personal claims made by the party leaders.\nBefore the assassination, hardly anyone thought Mrs. Gandhi could retain her majority, or do better than emerge with the largest bloc in an unstable coalition. Now, it seems possible that her party will be swept back to power in the election that is to begin Dec. 24. ''Almost the only way she could have kept Congress in power was by dying in this spectacular fashion,'' an Indian editor contended.\nYet in various ways, the death of one member of the Nehru clan and the rise of another represents a break with the past, rather than continuity. Rajiv Gandhi is ''midnight's child,'' to adapt the title of the Salman Rushdie novel - probably the most original recent novel to be inspired by India - whose central character is born at midnight on Aug. 15, 1947, the hour of independence. That is, Rajiv is the first Prime Minister to have come of age in independent India, without direct experience of the independence struggle or the hopes it aroused. (Actually, ''midnight'' came five days before his third birthday.) Even the Nehru era was just the backdrop to his childhood; he was not yet 20 when his grandfather died.\nHis lineage has absolutely everything to do with his inheritance of the Government, but now that he is where he is, his mother's ambiguous legacy of power, pride and intrigue is as much an obstacle for him to overcome as an advantage. It includes the mediocrity of leadership and the weakening of parties. It also includes the decay of administration and rise of violence as a negotiable currency in Indian political life, both of which were put on display after Mrs. Gandhi died. The testimony of Sikh refugees strongly indicated that officials of her own Congress Party, the nominal descendant of the movement that served as the instrument of Mahatma Gandhi's campaigns of nonviolent resistance, had helped to instigate the mob violence that followed her death. No sane person could blame Mrs. Gandhi for her own murder, but some Indians seemed to see it as a judgment on her reign, on her readiness to gather allies where she found them, without regard for values or the long-range consequences for India. Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, the Sikh extremist whose campaign of terrorism in the Punjab provoked the fateful Indian Army assault last June on the fortress he had established inside the Golden Temple, the holiest Sikh shrine, had been initially recruited into politics by Sanjay Gandhi after his mother's fall from power in 1977.\n39 HERE IS MUCH MORE TO THE PUNJAB story, but Bhindranwale can stand as a case study of what happened in Indian politics as Mrs. Gandhi mounted her return to power and then, after her amazing comeback at the polls in 1980, maneuvered to maintain it. Congress, her party, filled its campaign treasury with ''black money,'' the undeclared income of dubious businessmen, and accepted the support of smugglers and criminals who earned immunity from the law by their loyalty to Indira. Across the Hindi belt of northern India, it recruited local gangsters as its campaign workers and even elected them to office. Where opposition parties took office in the states, Congress stood ready to bribe their supporters with office or cash to encourage them to defect.\n''She pursued a scorched-earth policy,'' said Arun Shourie, a well- known journalist. ''She had no loyalty to institutions,'' agreed Prem Shankar Jha, a New Delhi editor. That might be her epitaph.\nIn the middle of the 12-day period of official mourning, these judgments were repeated in print. ''The criminalization of politics has lent a new respectability to violence,'' a columnist in the Indian Express could declare on the sixth morning after the assassination. ''It was Mrs. Gandhi who presided over the degradation of politics and the rise of violence. She inherited her own legacy.'' In itself, the column was proof that Indira Gandhi, whatever her inclinations, had not snuffed out Indian democracy.\nThe theme - that she had been destroyed by her own fatal flaws as a leader, by a rottenness in the state that she had not resisted - belonged to Elizabethan or Jacobean tragedy. It was Rajiv, the new man, the unknown quantity who suggested the Hindi movie ending in which his party and country would be redeemed. For, by dying as Indira Gandhi did, she had transformed the political debate. The central issue was no longer whether she should be given five more years to promote a dynastic succession. The grief occasioned by her death was conspicuously less intense than that which surged up from the rural heartland when her father and his immediate successor, Lal Bahadur Shastri, died. But she was now safely beyond attack, a figure for history, already mythic. The new issue was whether there was anyone in all of India who offered a better chance than Rajiv Gandhi to restore the institutions she was alleged to have undermined or that were undermined, if not by her, then by steadily intensifying social strife in Indian life during the period called the Indira Raj. ICOULD NOT THINK MY way through to the\nfuture, Rajiv Gandhi's and India's, without first looking back. Indira Gandhi's death had returned me to India for the first time in 10 years; 15 years had passed since I lived there. If her story, taken at its deepest level of meaning, could be regarded as a tragedy, then I was there for the first act and the final scene. There was much that I no longer understood, much that I had never learned, but some contrasts were clear in my mind.\nFirst, there was the contrast between the self-perpetuating dynastic figure she became and the painfully insecure woman she usually seemed when she was just getting used to her job as Prime Minister. And then there was the contrast between the India she inherited and the India she bequeathed.\nShe changed Indian politics, but she did not change India. It is not even clear that she thought it possible to change India. What she did believe, almost as a creed, was that no one else in Indian public life was capable of offering the kind of national leadership that was needed to hold the country together. The origins of this conviction are obscure. A woman of refined sensibility, she did not appear to derive personal gratification from wielding power; she clung to it as a duty. Maybe, in the beginning, it had to do with a vague sense that only she could keep India on the course her father set for it as a nonaligned state, committed to the rapid development of technology and heavy industry, to parliamentary democracy and secularism, and a kind of Fabian socialism. But then, one by one, she bent or abandoned most of his premises without letting go of her sense of her own role.\nShe never seemed to like politicians, especially Indian politicians, as a class of people. She also didn't care for people who approached her with agendas, unsolicited advice or strong arguments. She found it hard to delegate authority, preferring to see it lie unused rather than run the risk that it might be used in ways that would weaken her position. She was, one of her many critics remarked to me after her death, ''a leader without goals.''\nI got my clearest insight into her attitudes in the last conversation I ever had with her. I had traveled with her entourage on an overnight campaign swing; flying back to Delhi early the next morning on an Indian Air Force transport, I was invited to enter her compartment at the rear of the plane for a conversation while she picked at her breakfast, a small portion of plain boiled potatoes.\nAll that sticks in my mind now is an exchange about one of her cabinet colleagues who was presumed in those days to be a rival for her job. The man had a strong regional base in his home province, which compromised him in the eyes of the political barons from other sections. I asked how such a man could achieve status as a national leader, how India would find its leaders when it ran out of Nehrus. A little ungallantly, since Mrs. Gandhi was then only 51, I raised the question of the succession. Between bites, she plainly indicated her contempt for her colleague. The man lacked courage, she said. None of them had it.\n''Do you think any of them,'' she went on, referring to her party's most powerful figures, ''could hold this thing together?''\n''You mean the Congress Party?'' I ventured.\n''I mean India,'' she said wearily, as if she found it a trial to explain the obvious.\nShe meant India, when six months later she split the Congress Party, shattering the national movement her father had helped build, rather than conceding that it could override her in choosing a candidate for the ceremonial office of President. She meant India, when she declared the emergency rather than submit to the rule of the courts, which were about to banish her from office for election irregularities. She meant India, when, starting to rebuild her party after she was turned out of office in 1977, she accepted without question the alliances her son Sanjay made in her name. ''Indira is India, India is Indira,'' one of her sycophants proclaimed during the emergency. She retained a sense of proportion and would never have put it that way herself, but in some mystical way, it was what she believed. LOOKING AT WHAT happened to India in the same period, it is possible to invent a justification. The biggest difference between 1984 and 1966, the year Indira Gandhi came to power, is that there are 250 million more Indians; the figure bears repeating - 250 million!\nYet India, which could not prevent famine then, even with American food aid, now has a modest exportable surplus. It also takes less aid. Indira Gandhi felt humiliated by Lyndon Johnson, who made her plead for each shipment of wheat and proclaimed early on that India had to strive for self-reliance. Foreign aid accounted for 4.5 percent of the gross national product then; now it is down to scarcely 1 percent. The rate of economic growth has finally risen, and, although some economists are skeptical about the calculation, it now appears to be holding steady at above 4.5 percent a year.\nIn an era of spiraling debt for oil-importing nations, India started to exploit offshore deposits and managed to hold external debt at a manageable level, about one- fourth that of Mexico. Among the elite, there is a sense that India has shown the world that it is a regional power, not ''a basket case.'' A new monied class, produced by a liberalized economy, isn't embarrassed about flaunting its wealth. The Mercedes has arrived as a status symbol.\nBut the most that can be said for efforts to ease conditions of absolute poverty under the Indira Raj is that famine has been banished. As was the case 30 years ago, almost half the population remains desperately poor, with less than $8 a month per capita for the necessities of life; in the bottom 10 percent, where malnutrition persists, it is less than $4 - the price of a light lunch in one of Delhi's fancy new hotels, which are thronged more by Indians than by tourists.\nIndia has kept pace, if you talk only in terms of percentages, but the number of the very poor continues to mount in absolute terms by about 20,000 every single day. The country's population has doubled since Independence. The number of the very poor has doubled, too. In the 18 years since the start of the Indira Raj, the literacy rate crept up to 44 percent, a gain of maybe 10 percentage points. But, inevitably, the rise in population means there are more illiterates than ever - about 75 million more.\nMore rich, more poor, more middle-class - more everything, including corruption and violence. An India of 730 million is harder to govern than the India of 360 million that existed at Independence. Party affiliations are temporary mailing addresses that can always be changed; parties change names, change memberships, break up into factions and then recombine, as local subcaste or religious groups seize an opportunity to press a grievance or grab a little patronage, a chance to be among the bribed rather than among the bribers. It was a process Indira Gandhi had to master to sustain her idea of national leadership; in mastering it, she attracted to her side some of the shadiest, least-principled elements in Indian politics. There was nothing very edifying about the Congress Party machine that existed in my time in India, but it still reached down to the villages and, out of the maelstrom of competing demands, shaped a sense of national needs.\nIf there had been no Indira Gandhi, the Congress Party would probably have faded as a national movement and India might have seen a series of unstable coalitions at the national level, made up of strong regional parties. Maybe this would have led to military rule. Maybe it would have stimulated new alignments and leadership. Indira Gandhi postponed for a generation that inevitable testing time for Indian institutions, but to do so she had to keep the regional parties weak and off balance.\nThat was part of her preoccupation in the Punjab, India's most prosperous state, where Sikh politicians for two decades have reflexively used religion and trumped-up religious grievances as levers for their own advancement. No one could say the 14 million Sikhs were discriminated against as a group. They had more than their share of places in the Indian Army and the bureaucracy; they were among the country's most successful farmers and businessmen. But they had a dream of a Sikh state, and, while only a tiny fringe spoke of independence, most Sikhs subscribed to the idea that the Punjab - or rather what remained of the old colonial province after two partitions - should be dominated by Sikhs. As a creed, the Sikh faith was gentle and mystical, but the creed was wrapped up in the militant struggle of a self-conscious minority to preserve itself in the pre-colonial era against both the caste system and the pressure of Islam as promoted by the Mogul emperors. Delhi, the capital, was the main source of this pressure. Martyrs achieved sainthood by withstanding it.\nPlaying on that paradigm, and the tradition of symbolic politics bequeathed by another, greater Gandhi, leaders of a Sikh party called the Akali Dal routinely threatened martyrdom. Until Bhindranwale, it always seemed that martyrdom was a ploy. Then the game got out of hand.\nAmarender Singh, the son of the last Maharajah of Patiala and a Sikh member of Parliament in Mrs. Gandhi's party until the assault on the Golden Temple, when he resigned, is convinced that Mrs. Gandhi and her son, a friend from school days, were both genuinely seeking a settlement until February. ''Then it was decided that they were not going to concede anything further,'' he says. ''The attitude was, 'Let's be tough.' ''\nAfter the troops seized the Golden Temple on June 6, having had to use tanks and mortars to quell the extremists, there was a short-lived sense of jubilation in the Prime Minister's inner circle. By finally acting decisively, it was felt, she had turned the tide in an election year. But some who knew the Sikh traditions of martyrdom and vendetta said even then that she had sealed her own fate.\nThe operation was launched without any serious effort to prepare Sikh opinion, with key decisions taken in Mrs. Gandhi's closed inner circle. No one, it appears, gave consideration to the fact that she was sending her forces into the temple in a holy week commemorating the martyrdom in 1606 of one of the revered Sikh gurus at the hands of the Moguls of Delhi. The symbolism was perfect for Bhindranwale, slated for his own martyrdom in the assault, and the alienation of Sikhs generally. ''Can you imagine a more stupid thing?'' asked Lieut. Gen. Jagjit Singh Aurora, a national hero at the time of the 1971 war with Pakistan, when he had command of the Indian troops that took over what later became Bangladesh. TO GRASP THE political burdens and opportunities Rajiv Gandhi inherits, it helps to consider the trauma that prominent Sikhs like General Aurora have been through. Accustomed to moving easily in the mainstream of Indian life, they felt cut off from their community and from India in the aftermath of the assassination. General Aurora couldn't stay safely in his own home in an upper- class neighborhood in New Delhi, where mobs gutted 35 Sikh homes. He couldn't drive safely in his car. All over the city, families with the name Singh - which forms part of every Sikh name - took down the nameplates on their gates, even those who weren't Sikhs.\nBy the time the army was given the authority to deal with the mobs, reports were accumulating from refugees who repeatedly named local officials in the governing party, including several members of Parliament, as instigators. One member of Parliament, Dharam Dass Shastri, was reported to have gone to a police station to demand the release of looters. It was all right to recover stolen goods, he was quoted as saying, but, ''there is no need to arrest. These people are not criminals.''\nI went to see Mr. Shastri, a short, nervous man who chewed beetlenut, tapped his foot incessantly and protested his love for Sikhs, for all human beings, for the ideals of Indira Gandhi (''our mother''), for the ''vision'' of Rajiv Gandhi, for poetry - German poetry, Sanskrit poetry, any poetry - for the soul, peace and the Congress Party. If he had been behind the riots, he assured me, the whole of Delhi would have burned. But how could it be imagined that a man in his high position would stoop so low as to encourage rampaging ''animals,'' he asked, especially when he knew that ''tomorrow we have to face election music''?\nWhatever the merits of the accusation or the defense, it was evident that Dharam Dass Shastri had suddenly become aware that there was a new current running through Congress. Handpicked by Sanjay Gandhi on the strength of his loyalty to Sanjay's mother during her spell in the wilderness, he now seemed to fear that loyalty might not be enough to get him chosen again as a candidate. He was not a Sanjay man, not a member of any clique, he protested. He was against ''groupism'' in the party. He was even collecting testimonials from Sikhs to show the party's new leader who, he seemed to fear, might be inclined to jettison him as a candidate.\nThat might be unkind to Mr. Shastri, but a few such excommunications would send a signal to anxious Sikhs and to the nation at large that the new Prime Minister is serious about cleaning up his party and upgrading Indian public life.\nRajiv Gandhi's most obvious handicap, his inexperience, is also a strength. He cannot possibly be blamed for the autocratic actions his mother and brother took during the emergency, when he was flying for Indian Airlines, raising his children and staying as far out of politics as he possibly could. Friends who met him regularly in those days never heard him express himself one way or the other on political issues. To this day, no one seems to know whether he ever talked politics with Sanjay - the favored younger brother with whom his relations are said to have been sometimes difficult - and that uncertainty is enough to give him the benefit of the doubt among many who believe that India is now crying for a determined rooting out of the venality and malpractices that came to characterize the Indira Raj.\nRajiv Gandhi is the newest face in Indian politics, and politicians sense that if he surrounds himself with other new faces, or some old faces that his mother had banished, and otherwise distances himself from her record while invoking her name, he can, in effect, run as a reformer against his own party - and win.\nThat is basically the tactic that Indira Gandhi herself employed in her 1971 victory, promising to ''abolish poverty.'' The belief that a reformer's stance could be more than tactical in the case of her son derives from the views that are broadly ascribed to Rajiv Gandhi on the strength of rumor, surmise and wishful thinking. All these are necessary to deepen the faint impression he seems to have left after three years in Indian public life, which he entered after his brother's death because, as he put it in an early interview, ''Mummy has to be helped somehow.''\nFrom the facts that he studied mechanical engineering at Cambridge and went on to be a pilot, it is deduced that he has a technical bent. If this ''midnight's child'' carries any ideological baggage, it contains contemporary doctrines of management; that is to say, he cares about systems and efficiency. Before he inherited the Government, he attracted some mockery for attempting to use computers to streamline his party's election preparations.\nIn the economic sphere, India's sixth Prime Minister has paid lip service to socialism, but he is likely, if India's voters give him a mandate, to accelerate a process of reducing controls on the private sector that has been under way in recent years. Instead of having state-owned industries run by civil servants, as has been the practice in India, he is said to favor hiring industrial managers from private industry at competitive salaries.\nThose who claim to know him say Rajiv is intelligent and amiably good-humored. ''He is a much more confident person than Indira was in 1966,'' commented a friend who has known him since Cambridge. He is also said to have some of his grandfather Nehru's shortness of temper when confronted by sloth or mismanagement. From such adumbrations of a personality, it is reasoned that he might be secure enough, unlike his mother, to delegate authority to persons with initiative. THE JOB OF INDIAN Prime Minister is arguably the world's greatest managerial challenge, but the dreamy image of Indira Gandhi's son sweeping out New Delhi's Augean stables needs some focusing. As a practical matter, Rajiv Gandhi must know that his Congress Party cannot be made new overnight. A wholesale purge of the party's more dubious elements could endanger its electoral base because, in most parts of the country, it has no organization at all at the grass roots. Engineering his mother's last victory, Sanjay Gandhi found persons of local influence who knew how to get out the vote (or, in opposition areas, keep it home), without being overly fastidious about what kind of influence they had or what they might ask in return. Even before the assassination of his mother, Rajiv Gandhi had begun a series of intensive interviews of prospective parliamentary candidates in order to shape a party that would be responsive to his leadership. But he still has to consider the possibility that those he purges may end up on the other side.\nHis newness, his youth and the traumatic circumstances in which he inherited his burden will arouse sympathy and hope. Naturally, the voters want their happy ending. But Rajiv Gandhi is unlikely to be galvanizing as a campaigner. An intensely private person, he shrinks from displaying emotion in public. His brief statements on television in the aftermath of the assassination sounded strangely uninflected, as if they were coming not from a bereaved son or a leader suddenly laden with heavy responsibilities but from an official spokesman reading out a communique that a committee had drafted.\nHis political judgment, values and ability are also open to question because he appears to have been implicated, in varying degrees, in recent Congress efforts to bribe or otherwise lure potential defectors from the governing parties in Kashmir, Karnataka and Andhra states to bring down the local governments. The Kashmir ''toppling'' succeeded; the Karnataka one failed, and the Andhra one boomeranged badly, inspiring mass protests in the state that soon forced the return to office of the ousted chief minister, a former movie idol named N. T. Rama Rao, who now may emerge as a pivotal figure in the efforts of a fragmented opposition to form an election alliance against the Congress Party. A couple of weeks before the assassination caused Indian commentators to look at Rajiv Gandhi with new respect, the nation's leading news weekly spoke in an offhand way of ''the almost universal realization that Rajiv Gandhi has fallen far short of expectations and is no substitute for his mother.''\nIt has all happened so fast - the assassination, Rajiv Gandhi's virtually instantaneous succession as Prime Minister (which happened before the Parliamentary Party could meet or vote), and now the national campaign. Rajiv Gandhi can hardly have had time to mourn or reflect, let alone to find strong advisers he can trust to bring unwelcome news or unpalatable advice, neither of which secured entree to Indira Gandhi's court. Until now, his tiny circle of political confidants has been made up almost entirely of friends he knew in school, either at Cambridge or at the Doon School, India's version of Groton or St. Paul's. His two most important aides, whom he promptly installed in key party positions, are Doon School contemporaries, Arun Singh and Arun Nehru, a cousin. Like Rajiv, they appear to be serious, well-intentioned, uncomplicated and relatively remote from the harsh social and political realities of India.\nTheir India is essentially urban; their social circle, the business elite. These are early days, but it is hard to imagine Rajiv Gandhi ever feeling the need for the kind of communion with the rural masses on which his grandfather and also his mother depended to renew their sense of India and their own role. Wearing homespun, a shawl or what used to be called a Nehru jacket is a political duty; friends say he is more comfortable in blazers and jeans. What political onlookers in New Delhi are watching as an index of his political resourcefulness is whether the new Prime Minister will reach out beyond the two Aruns - or his mother's old palace guard, which he has so far retained - or whether they will form the nucleus of a new inner court, rendering him permanently remote.\nCharan Singh, an 82-year- old opposition leader who was briefly Prime Minister when the non-Congress coalition that swept to power in 1977 crumbled two years later, touched on the question of remoteness when I asked him about the political prospects of Indira Gandhi's son: ''He's educated, but he's not acquainted with the problems that face this poor country or their possible solution. A good young man, that's all that can be said. But what does this young man know about administration? He couldn't even be a successful chairman of a municipal corporation.''\nI recognized that patronizing tone. It always came up in conversations in my time in India with the senior political leaders who installed Indira Gandhi in office because they could not resolve their own rivalries for her job. Later, it changed to resentment when they discovered they could not get her out. But then it was too late.\nCharan Singh, who has strong support in the rural heartland of north India, is a potential ally in two senses. As much as any other single factor, it is the old man's craving to be Prime Minister again that has kept the opposition divided. If it stays divided and Congress fails to hold its majority, it is not unthinkable that Charan Singh would be willing to enter a government headed by ''this young man.'' The death of Indira Gandhi and her replacement by a son who is the object, as yet, of nobody's grievances makes possible all sorts of new alignments in Indian politics - before the election, after the election, over the next few years.\nChanging planes on my way to New Delhi, I had grabbed a bunch of English newspapers and read their commentaries on the death of Indira Gandhi. All the ones I saw credited her with having held India together, implying that it might now fly apart if her son failed to repeat the feat. It was, I thought, an unconscious reprise of the old colonial theme that the nation-state called India was strictly an invention of her colonizers, fashioned from the primordial anarchy of Hindustan. That jogged my memory, reminding me of an Indira Gandhi I admired, the proud nationalist who wheeled one morning in 1967 on the correspondent of a British paper and scathingly said: ''You people never thought we could do it. You're always expecting us to collapse.''\nThe correspondent had laid himself open to this skewering by indulging himself in print in a categorical forecast that the general election that had just taken place would prove to have been India's last exercise in democracy. In the near future, he predicted, the country would be taken over by a man on a white horse or a man on a cow, meaning either the army or Hindu chauvinists. From the distance of 1984, there were a lot of ironies in this memory. The election due to be held in three weeks will be the fourth national election since 1967. It wasn't a man on horseback but rather Indira Gandhi herself who threatened to terminate Indian democracy. And, whatever was thought in London when she died, she appears to have been practically alone in India in thinking she was holding the country together.\nOthers, just as simplistically, no doubt, said it was she who was keeping India from focusing on her real problems of social misery, the decay of institutions and violence. ''She showed us that she wasn't the solution,'' said Arun Shourie, the well-known journalist, ''but we must learn that she wasn't the problem, either.''",
