Born in a brutal war between India and Pakistan, the country has survived the assassination of two leaders and several coups. Floods, droughts, famine and violent tropical storms are virtually routine.\nThe storm that devastated southeastern Bangladesh last week hit as the country was beginning to show progress in economic growth and political stability. Of itself, economists and political experts said, the storm would probably not set the country far back in these areas. But neither do they see much chance for Bangladesh to solve its many problems.\nFew countries are so poor, so densely crowded and so ignored by outsiders. Bangladesh was once dismissed as ''a basket case'' by former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. Its population is close to 100 million and 7,000 people are born each day, approximately the number that died in last week's storm. As of last year, Bangladesh had received nearly $15 billion in aid but had disbursed only two-thirds of it. Even so, an array of countries and international relief organizations lined up to provide at least $12 million in emergency help for the victims of the hurricane-like storm, which in this part of the world is called a cyclone.\nNatural disasters have always been a part of the nation's fate. Indeed, a gigantic cyclone in 1970, killing an estimated 300,000 on the southern coast, helped to bring on independence. Bangladesh was known then as the eastern province of Pakistan, created when Britain partitioned India in 1947. For years, the province felt ignored by Pakistan's leaders in the west, a feeling that crystallized when President Yahya Khan did not even visit the cyclone-ravaged area in 1970. The next year, in national elections, voters supported an autonomy movement. Pakistan tried to quash it by arresting the leaders, Indian troops intervened and Bangladesh was born.\nPerhaps mindful of the precedent, Lieut. Gen. Hussain Mohammed Ershad, the Bangladesh leader, toured the cyclone zone like a seasoned politician. He distributed food, handed out 100-taka notes (worth about $3) and even spent the night camped out on the worst-hit island.\nSome analysts saw Mr. Ershad's performance as evidence that he may keep his promise to restore civilian rule and seek election as President. He seized power in 1982 and runs the country under martial law, arresting or harassing political opponents at will. The army provides the bureaucrats who shape and implement policy and who benefit from privileges and the widespread corruption. Whether the army would permit a return to civilian rule is one question. Another is whether the elections would be legitimate. Mr. Ershad recently sponsored and ''won'' a referendum endorsing his policies, which opponents attacked as rigged. Then last month, he held elections for 460 local district leaders; 200 posts were won by a new political party supporting the general, an indication that he has started to build a political base.\nAt one time, opposition parties, such as the Awami League and the Bangladesh National Party, toyed with calling Mr. Ershad's bluff and fielding candidates. But like the opposition in Pakistan, they decided instead to boycott the election and perhaps even disrupt it. General Ershad then tightened martial law, arrested opposition leaders and shut down the universities. He promises parliamentary and even presidential elections this year, a prospect that could bring agitation and turmoil. But even under nominal civilian rule, a Government spokesman said last week, the army might continue to assist in certain ''administrative'' functions, such as public works, transportation and health care.\nDisappointed Donors\nFor all his erratic behavior, Western diplomats credit Mr. Ershad with bringing stability that has permitted the economy and agricultural productivity to turn upward recently. The detention of political opponents is usually temporary. Two critics freed this week after three months in jail went immediately to the scene of the cyclone and criticized Government relief efforts.\nFor years, Bangladesh has been trying to lift Government economic controls. Government jute and textile factories have been turned over to private owners and steps have been taken to cut subsidies. But the pace has disappointed the World Bank and other aid donors. Meeting in Paris last month, the bankers reportedly decided to push harder for a halt to subsidizing fertilizer, natural gas, food and interest rates for well-connected constituency groups. Economists contend that Bangladesh is strangling because of bureaucratic red tape, corruption and failure to make businesses repay loans.\nBut the most difficult task is to slow the growth of the population. With outside assistance, the Government has tried education, distributing contraceptives and voluntary sterilization. But the growth rate is still 2.5 percent, or 2.5 million more people a year. Bangladesh's best hopes may lie in improving agricultural productivity. The ''Green Revolution'' has had some effect, but experts see little prospect of major results. And if conditions are seen as deteriorating, they fear renewed agitation and political turmoil."}, {"text": "BANGLADESHIS SAY 10,000 MAY BE LOST IN CYCLONE'S WAKE\n1985-05-28T05:00:00.000Z\nGovernment authorities, widening search and rescue efforts in the islands of southeastern Bangladesh, said tonight that as many as 10,000 people were now believed missing and feared dead after a cyclone devastated the area over the weekend.\nThe seas were reported littered with floating bodies. The Government-run Bangladesh radio said that 80 percent of croplands had been devastated and that it was feared that 500,000 head of cattle were missing. News reports said hundreds of fishing boats had been swamped in a fishing area critical to the nation's economy.\nAuthorities indicated today that it was possible that the Government might never know the full death toll or extent of the damage. The entire affected area has a population of about 10 million people.\nCasualty Figures Revised\nA Government spokesman said the official death toll was now 1,300, down from the figure of at least 1,400 given by officials on Sunday.\nThe news agency Reuters, meanwhile, reported that 3,000 bodies had been recovered and that 12,000 people were missing.\nAn earlier report that 10,000 people had been swept off one island alone was discounted by some Government officials today as exaggerated.\nArea Is Still Buffeted by Seas\n''A clear picture of the total havoc has yet to emerge,'' the spokesman said at a briefing late tonight at a Government command post in this sweltering capital city. [In Washington, the State Department said the United States was making an initial emergency gift of $25,000 to Bangladesh for disaster assistance. A spokesman said that this was ''a routine response'' and that when more detailed information is received a decision will be made on additional aid.] Much of the affected area was reportedly still being swept by high winds and heavy seas today, hampering rescue efforts.\nThere were some estimates this evening that perhaps 250,000 had lost their homes. A Government official said he believed that 80 percent of the homes in the area had been flattened, but he said he had no firm figures.\nBangladesh's President, Lieut. Gen. H. M. Ershad, declared Tuesday to be a national day of mourning, with flags to be flown at half-staff.\nHe appealed for voluntary relief efforts to raise money for the victims. He also canceled a visit to China scheduled for this week.\nThe Government spokesman said six naval ships sent to the area had fished 100 bodies out of the water and rescued about 1,000 people, many on makeshift life rafts.\nFears for Island's People\nThe spokesman, Col. Abu Nayeem Amin Ahmed, said that it was feared that at least one island, Ulir Char, may have been ''washed away.''\nA spokesman for President Ershad estimated that about one-fourth of the island's population had survived, but he said it was impossible to tell now whether the island's population had been 2,000, 5,000 or perhaps 20,000.\nBehind Colonel Ahmed as he gave his briefing was a huge map of the country, and hanging on the walls around him were charts showing the latest information on damage. Among the rescue efforts were the dispatch of technicians to help to dig new deep wells and repair old wells, because the lack of drinking water was said to be acute in several areas.\nThe colonel said the storm hit the region around midnight Friday and continued to pound the area throughout Saturday. The storm-generated waves averaged 8 to 12 feet high, he said. There was no estimate of property damage.\nPresident Ershad said today that the flooding and devastation caused by the high waves and rains were the ''worst tragedy in Bangladesh history.''\nBangladesh, formerly East Pakistan, became independent in 1971, a year after a tidal wave and cyclone devastated the region and left at least 300,000 people dead.\nArea Was Struck in 1970\nThe seven islands most affected were Sandwip, Hatia, Mahesh Khali, Bhola, Ulir Char, Char Clerk and Dhal Char. The area was struck in 1970 by the cyclone and storm-generated wave.\nPresident Ershad toured the stricken area again today, and television footage showed the islands he visited covered with water, with twisted bodies scattered in the mud.\nGeneral Ershad's trip today was his second in two days. He said he planned to make another one on Tuesday to other parts of the devastated region.\nThe nation's largest-circulation newspaper, Ittefaq, reported that the survivors were on bamboo rafts and floating rooftops in waters infested by sharks and crocodiles.\nThe cyclone, part of the season's annual monsoon rains in the southern part of the country, struck a cluster of seven islands at the mouth of the Meghna River, part of the delta system in the Bengal basin, which includes the Ganges River estuary. Some of the islands formed only in the last few years from tons of silt deposited from the Ganges and Brahmaputra River systems, which twist through the area on their way to the sea from the Himalaya Mountains in the north and west.\nIslands Made of Shifting Silt\nGovernment officials said the silt shifts constantly, eroding some islands and creating new ones. Settlers move about in search of farmland where rice can be grown and sheep and cattle can be grazed. As a result of such population shifts, the officials said, it is difficult to determine the population of the affected area.\nGeneral Ershad, who rules by martial law, distributed biscuits, drinking water, canned food and other staples. The Government is also distributing $300,000 from a special cash relief fund.\nBangladesh has been plagued by economic and weather disasters for years. A country about the size of the state of Wisconsin, it had such heavy rains last year that floods left an estimated 60 percent of the country under water.\nSurrounded on three sides by India, it was created as East Pakistan in 1947 and broke from West Pakistan in 1971 with the help of India. Almost the entire country consists of the fertile alluvial soil of the delta, and the nation has one of the world's highest annual rainfalls.\nMonsoon rains sweep up twice a year from the south, once from the west in the spring and once from the east in the fall. In 1963, a devastating cyclone struck the capital, Dhaka, and the island area that was hit this year."}, {"text": "3 YEARS IN OFFICE, BANGLADESH RULER SEEKS MANDATE\n1985-12-13T05:00:00.000Z\nNearly three years after seizing power in a coup, Lieut. Gen. H. M. Ershad has yet to succeed in arranging an election to legitimize his rule, according to politicians and diplomats here.\nAides to General Ershad say he plans to hold an election next spring, and that his newly built political organization should propel him to victory as an elected President of Bangladesh.\nBut General Ershad, who declared himself President in 1983, has scheduled elections three times in recent years, only to call them off after the collapse of negotiations with opposition leaders on the terms of the voting.\nEach time, the opposition leaders have said they would boycott the election rather than participate in balloting they considered neither free nor fair.\nPlans to Go Ahead\nNow General Ershad is once again about to start talks with the opposition leaders, but this time his aides say he will go forward with the voting whether or not there is a boycott, perhaps provoking more protests and even violence.\n''There is a limit to anyone's patience,'' said Shah Moazzem Hossain, the Information Minister. ''The President has made many concessions to these opposition people. He has listened to them a long time. But this process cannot go on forever.''\nMany politicians and diplomats here say that, although General Ershad may not be a popular leader, he seems to have consolidated his rule and to be benefiting from certain trends.\nThe economy has achieved modest growth in recent years, helped in part by the country's political stability and by General Ershad's encouragement of private enterprise.\nA cyclone that devastated southern Bangladesh in May, killing thousands of people, badly hurt the economy. But experts say there will still be some growth.\nProjecting Himself as Leader\nGeneral Ershad is also said to have skilfully used his Government's publicity apparatus to project himself as a leader.\nWhen the cyclone struck, he personally brought aid to flooded areas, handing out cash as television cameras whirred. Over the weekend, he got wide publicity as chairman of the first conference of leaders in South Asia.\nGeneral Ershad has also benefited because the opposition has been badly divided, with several key leaders accepting his invitation to join the Government in recent months.\nAfter General Ershad canceled elections last March, he jailed many opposition leaders, banned political activity and shut down the universities.\nDuring the summer and fall, he eased the restrictions, reopening the universities, permitting political meetings as long as they were held indoors, and re-establishing civilian courts in the districts.\nCharges of Needless Spending\nOpposition leaders have lately stepped up their attacks on the general, charging that he spent millions of dollars needlessly for the South Asian meeting. The money went for repaved roads, colored lights, new fountains and other refurbishments in this busy port city.\nSheikh Hasina Wajed, president of the opposition Bangladesh Awami League and daughter of Bangladesh's first Prime Minister, criticized the meeting of the region's leaders for failing to address what she called ''the disastrous consequences of military regimes in South Asia.''\nGeneral Ershad has not always succeeded in building support for himself. In elections this year, his newly formed political organization won control of nearly half of the country's 460 subdistricts. But his effort to transform this base into a strong, unified political party are widely believed to have faltered.\nIn addition, by some accounts, criticism of General Ershad has been spreading among middle- and upper-class people in the cities in Bangladesh.\nMr. Hossain, the Information Minister, acknowledged that General Ershad's popularity had slipped in ''the urban communities'' but he added: ''In the villages where most of our people live, his popularity has not gone down. I would rather say it has gone up.''\nA Chance of Instability\nNevertheless, politicians point out that disenchantment in the cities can lead to instability, particularly if there is an election boycott and students resume their anti-Government protests.\nDiplomats and politicians say there have also been mounting charges of corruption against General Ershad and his wife, Raushan, who last month was given a new office and staff as First Lady of Bangladesh.\nThe critics assert that General and Mrs. Ershad get kickbacks on Government contracts. ''There is a lot of hard evidence,'' said Dr. Kamal Hussain, a former Foreign Minister. ''But the newspapers aren't allowed to print it.''\nGovernment officials deny the charges.\nDr. Hussain, a key opposition strategist, said in an interview that it was not certain whether the opposition would boycott the election if it is held next year.\nElection Commission Sought\nHe said the opposition would demand that General Ershad withdraw himself completely from the election campaign and process, giving the responsibility for running the election to a neutral commission.\nIn addition, he demanded that General Ershad wait until after the parliamentary elections before holding elections for President. ''Once a president is elected, the election will become a means for his packing Parliament,'' he said.\nBut few of these demands appear likely to be met. Mr. Hossain, the Information Minister, said he thought General Ershad might hold the presidential elections the same day as the parliamentary elections, insuring that he would be an active participant in the campaigning.\nOpposition leaders say that if this happens, there will be a boycott and, eventually, more anti-Government agitations in the streets."}, {"text": "SHIFTING ISLANDS OFTEN HIT BY CYCLONES\n1985-05-27T05:00:00.000Z\nHigh waves like those that raked the Bangladesh coastline and the spray of islands in the Ganges River delta this weekend strike the country annually, often destroying the homes and crops of hundreds of thousands of people and, occasionally, taking as many lives.\nThousands of islands are created, swept away and recreated every year at the point where the myriad brown waterways of the Ganges delta tumble into the Bay of Bengal. And these shifting islands, called ''chars,'' teem with farmers during the day who come to plant and harvest rice in the rich soil.\nIt was from these islands that hundreds, possibly thousands of Bengalis were swept into the ocean Saturday by 10- to 15-foot waves created by a cyclone with winds as high as 100 miles per hour. Bangladesh officials said it was impossible to tell yet how many people were lost; the confirmed death toll was at least 1,400.\nBangladesh is especially susceptible to the ravages of cyclones and the high waves, called ''tidal bores,'' that race along before them. Its landscape is broad and flat, cut by the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers, and one-third of the country floods annually as monsoon rains cause the rivers to overflow their banks.\nDensely Populated Country\nIt is also one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with at least 95 million people crowded into 55,126 square miles, an area the size of Wisconsin.\nEvery year is marked by flooding that destroys homes, scarce crops, and lives. There are also droughts, and, after both, famine.\nOn Nov. 11 and 12, 1970, a cyclone swept across the Ganges Delta and drove the sea far inland, flooding countless villages and killing at least 300,000 people. There were reports that the toll reached as high as half a million. No final tally has ever been settled on because many of those believed to have been killed had never been registered with the government and many were migrant workers.\nIn June 1976, torrential monsoon rains killed at least 143 people by government officials' count and 300,000 more lost their homes. In April 1977, waves created by a tropical cyclone in the Indian Ocean killed more than 600 people. In 1980, more flooding forced the evacuation of 500,000 and 10 deaths were reported. And as recently as last June, flooding was blamed for the loss of 200 lives and the destruction of more than 50,000 homes.\nCasualty Rates Vary Greatly\n''They get them annually,'' Ken Comba, a meteorologist with the United States National Weather Service in Washington said of the cyclones, ''but depending on how they hit and where they hit, the casualty rate varies tremendously.''\nThe storm Saturday started forming in the Indian Ocean at midweek, gathering strength from the evaporation of the ocean's warm water, and began moving slowly toward the Bay of Bengal, he said.\nBy the time the center of the storm struck land, just west of the capital, Dhaka, on Saturday, its winds were blowing steadily at 55 m.p.h., with gusts of 70 to 100 m.p.h., along a stretch of more than 100 miles, Mr. Comba said.\nAlthough officials in Dhaka said that thousands of people were evacuated from the coastal communities, relief officials and journalists who have covered the region say that the country has never developed an adequate system to evacuate the islands. Its navy, for example, has only 5,300 members.\nIt is questionable whether or not Government officials should allow people to live or farm the delta's islands, these authorities say, but the country is so overcrowded that people eagerly take whatever land they are offered.\nForeign Aid Has Declined\nRelief authorities also say that it is unclear whether Bangladesh, the poorest large country in Asia, with an annual per capita income of $105, could even afford to develop an effective evacuation system or other mechanisms to protect its villagers against the tidal bores.\nThe nation is not getting nearly as much foreign relief aid as it received in the years immediately following its independence, a time when United States officials called it ''an interntional basket case.'' After a bloody civil war in 1971, the country, which had been East Pakistan since 1947, gained its independence from Pakistan.\nThen, the United Nations organized a relief effort that was unprecedented in both size and duration. Nearly $1 billion was committed to the nation and the relief efforts, in the form of grain drops from cargo planes and ships filled with food, continued for several years.\nIn the fiscal year 1981-1982, for example, the United States sent more than $166 million in aid to Bangladesh and the World Bank lent about $391 million."}, {"text": "STORMS BATTER ASIAN COUNTRIES FROM INDIA TO THE PHILIPPINES\n1985-10-20T05:00:00.000Z\nStorms continued to batter countries in Asia today, with Typhoon Dot leaving 31 people dead and thousands homeless after hitting the Philippines' main island of Luzon with heavy rains and winds of up to 70 miles an hour.\nIn India, flooding set off by storms killed 29 people, bringing India's two-day death toll to 78.\nRescue operations were also going on in Bangladesh and Thailand, where typhoons and lesser storms beginning Tuesday caused floods and mudslides, killing at least 28 people and leaving many thousands homeless.\nThe Philippines' death toll was expected to climb as communications with isolated areas were restored.\nPresident Ferdinand E. Marcos said the typhoon, which later moved away from the Philippines, had caused less damage and casualties than expected.\n''A miracle has happened, and the typhoon spared Manila and environs,'' he said on television. ''We should thank the Lord for this miracle.''\nThe typhoon was originally headed for Manila, with winds of up to 150 miles an hour. But after hitting the east coast of Luzon at midnight, it veered northwest and broke into two weaker storms as it crossed the Sierra Madre mountains.\nThe storms, one with winds of up to 70 miles an hour, later merged over the South China Sea and moved toward Vietnam.\nOn the Indian subcontinent, the United News of India reported that seven people were killed today in Uttar Pradesh state, where three months of monsoon rains have killed 646 people, including 49 on Friday. Most victims were drowned or died in house collapses and landslides.\nThe agency said 22 people died Saturday in Orissa and West Bengal in flooding caused by a storm on Wednesday. Officials have said 4.5 million people had been evacuated and more than 150,000 people had lost their homes as a result of the storm.\nBangladesh officials said 12 people were killed in successive typhoons Wednesday and Thursday, and Thai officials said 16 people died when two other typhoons triggered flash floods.\nOfficials in the Philippines said scattered flooding and power outages were reported and many roads were blocked by landslides and fallen trees.\nLuz Reyes of the Office of Civil Defense said nearly 50,000 people were transferred to evacuation centers in four provinces."}, {"text": "NEW YORK; A TIDAL WAVE OF BAD FORTUNE\n1985-05-28T05:00:00.000Z\nAt no time do we in the developed, industrial world become more aware of the accidental good fortune we enjoy than when the habitual meanness of life in one of the globe's impoverished nations is made even meaner by a natural disaster.\nSuch is the case now in Bangladesh, whose coastal delta, with its heavily populated and poorly protected network of islands, was struck on Saturday by a cyclone and tidal wave. With communications primitive, there is no way to estimate the death toll, except that it is likely in the tens of thousands - and possibly higher.\nWeather calamities are so common in Bangladesh - monsoon floods and cyclones and droughts - that the average disasters, in which sometimes hundreds are killed, cause barely a ripple in this troubled nation's life. But the cyclone that smote the delta over the weekend - and the huge tidal wave it pushed before it -was not average.\nIt brought to mind the cyclone-tidal wave of 1970 - before Bangladesh's independence, when it was still the eastern wing of Pakistan. That awful storm was estimated to have taken at least 300,000 Bengali lives and maybe as many as half a million. For comparison, Buffalo has about 350,000 people and Newark about 320,000. All of Vermont has about 520,000.\nI covered that event 15 years ago, which is what has sent my memory racing backward. What I remember most was the silence.\nAfter a few days on the destroyed islands, one came to realize why everything was so still. No dogs barked, because the storm had killed them. No cattle lowed, because they had died, too. Even the birds were gone, killed or driven off by the winds.\nBut most telling of all, the sound of children playing was absent. The children - who were the least strong and therefore the least able to hold tight to the trunk of a palm tree through the storm - had suffered great casualties. And those children who survived spent the first few weeks of the aftermath in a mute daze of trauma.\nThese scenes are likely being repeated now.\nWe in the technological West suffer tropical storms, too. Cities of the Gulf and Atlantic coasts are swept by hurricanes every year. But we have early-warning systems and, more important, somewhere to evacuate to and a network of good roads to provide the avenues of that escape.\nIn the delta of Bangladesh, although there is a warning system that the island dwellers can hear on their transistor radios, there are no bridges or boatlifts to carry them to safety on the mainland. And there is no high ground to take refuge on; most of the islands are no more than 10 feet above sea level.\nIt is no accident that the Bengalis are among the most devout of the world's Moslems. They have come to accept nature's furies as manifestations of Allah's will.\n''It is the wish of Allah that this wind and water came,'' said a fisherman in 1970, a remark that was echoed then all over the delta. ''We have sinned. It would not have happened if we had not sinned.''\nWhen you are as luckless as these people are, fatalism is a useful psychic protection.\nForeign newcomers to Bangladesh are prone to ask why anyone chooses to live on these precarious islands and coastal flats. One answer is rice; the soil is wonderfully fertile silt brought down by the massive flow of the Ganges-Brahmaputra river system.\nBut the real answer is population pressure. Bangladesh has roughly 100 million people living in a space the size of Wisconsin - which has less that five million. Virtually no unoccupied or uncultivated land is left in the northern regions of the country, so the marginal people, the poorest, are pushed ever southward to the delta and its islands.\nStatistics can be sleep-producing, but at times they can illuminate. Here in the United States, life expectancy is now over 70 years and we are experimenting with devices and medicines to make it longer; in Bangladesh, the expectancy is around 47. Our per capita income is around $9,000 a year; theirs is $105. Our population density is 64 per square mile; theirs is around 1,600.\nAfter the 1970 tidal wave, the bodies of the dead were so numerous that sometimes, instead of being buried, they were simply piled onto makeshift rafts and pushed out to sea. ''They were floating like water hyacinths for miles,'' one of the survivors said.\nIt is an image that has the capacity to remind us of the uneven distribution of the world's blessings."}, {"text": "RUIN AND RENEWAL IN BENGAL\n1985-06-23T05:00:00.000Z\nTHEY SPEAK ONE OF THE GREAT LITERARY languages of Asia. They embraced Western concepts and forms long before their neighbors, then pioneered resistance to colonial rule. Their conversation, when it is not indulging in witty, often spiteful gossip, tends to be intensely political. And their politics - usually passionate, seldom middle-of-the-road - tend to be nationalistic and radical. They proudly defy stereotypes - including these - and yet retain a national character that evokes tenderness and admiration. All these things need to be set down before you say where they live and who they are, because once you mention Bangladesh and Calcutta - place names that have become synonymous with calamity and third-world misery - the Bengalis become objects of pity.\nIn part, that is because the world's attention quickly turns away from their steamy, overcrowded corner of South Asia in between catastrophes. Often these are meteorological in origin - like the cyclone a few weeks ago that churned the Bay of Bengal and sent yet another huge tidal wave crashing over the low-lying Bangladesh coast, with a loss of perhaps 10,000 lives - but sometimes they are man-made. In this century the man-made disasters have probably had the more far-reaching effects. The Bengal famine of 1943-44, for instance, was attributable to hoarding and disruptions in the distribution system rather than a failure of crops, but it claimed 3.5 million lives. Among its more notable victims was the British colonial government, which lost whatever legitimacy it had through its failure to prevent mass starvation. Only two years later, the Great Calcutta Killing - as it has ever since been known - left 6,000 Hindus and Moslems dead in the city's streets in a one-night orgy of mutual slaughter that, more than any other single event, insured the partition of British India so as to create Pakistan out of Moslem-majority areas in the east and west. The partition meant the vivisection of Bengal, an outcome that the 180 million or more Bengalis now living in the two resulting Bengals, elsewhere in India or the world, seem to deplore overwhelmingly but to accept more or less as permanent.\nUnder the glare of the tropical sun or lowering monsoon skies, the distinction between fate in the form of bad weather and calamities that are man-made sometimes blurs. Predominantly Moslem Bangladesh - the former East Pakistan, nee East Bengal - owes its birth, it is sometimes suggested, to just such a blurring. The Punjabi military elite, then and now dominant in Pakistan, could reasonably be accused of having established an exploitive colonial regime in East Bengal, the majority province in what was a weirdly misconceived excuse for a nation with two wings, no center and nearly 1,000 miles of Indian land mass in between where a center might have been. Still, it was hard to blame the Punjabis for the tidal wave that overwhelmed the Bengal coast on Nov. 13, 1970, killing anywhere from 300,000 to 500,000 people in what may have been the century's worst natural disaster. Hard, that is, for anyone but the Bengalis. Incensed over a Pakistani relief effort that was laggard to the point of seeming inert, they forged a national consciousness by doing just that. The victims of the cyclone became the ''one million martyrs'' in the speeches of Sheik Mujibur Rahman, the leader of a Bengali autonomy movement that finally provoked a brutal and mindless military crackdown by the Pakistani army. Ultimately, it was the Pakistan of the 1947 partition that the tidal wave drowned. Thirteen months later, Bengali resistance and an Indian invasion established Bangladesh as an independent nation.\nSo Bengal has known both man-made disasters and disaster-made history. The wonder in Bengal is not that so many people can die in a natural disaster. (As early as 1737, less than half a century after Calcutta was established in a swamp by British traders, a tidal wave roared up from the Bay of Bengal and drowned an estimated 300,000 people in the vicinity.) The wonder is that so many survive in between disasters, improvising precarious livelihoods as ragpickers, beggars and day laborers, desperately competing with cattle for work. There is no other part of the world in which more people have to work so hard, doing so little that is necessary or productive in order to survive.\nIn part, the pattern of ruin and renewal is decreed by geography. An Englishman, oblivious to the sensuous patterns a tropical breeze can make as it ripples the surface of a field of ripening green paddy, once summed up the flat topography as ''new mud, old mud and marsh.'' He was pointing to the basic nature of the land, possibly the world's greatest delta; in fact, it is several deltas, providing outlets for the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers and their tributaries, as they flow from the Himalayas, flooding annually with more or less devastating results but leaving new deposits of fertile alluvial soil. New mud is Bengal's most important natural resource. In the delta, a little piece of it is something for which a man will fight and die. Cyclones and floods regularly menace, but the most exposed and dangerous pieces of land are promptly reoccupied as the waters recede. In Bangladesh - as densely populated a nation as there is in the world - no arable land can be allowed to lie fallow.\nWhat Bengal hasn't known in this century is a government that could sustain its support, or a persuasive vision of its future that it could embrace with the passion it has directed against foreign overlords. When I lived in India, I was drawn repeatedly to Bengal, especially Calcutta. I wrote about it as a social disaster, but the truth was that it charmed me.\nConversation in New Delhi always seemed to be about who was up and who was down in Indira Gandhi's inner circle or the World Bank. In Calcutta such topics rated as trivia. There you might find yourself discussing French movies, Chinese revolutionary politics or the latest adaptation in Bengali of a play by Yeats. The city's literati weren't encountered only in its colleges and coffeehouses where adda - talk - is a pastime to be indulged at almost any hour of the working day. They turned up almost anywhere a literate Bengali might find employment - government offices, ad agencies, even a police station, as I discovered on an early visit when a high-ranking officer diverted an interview from the subject of trade-union violence to that of the novels of William Makepeace Thackeray who, it turned out, had been born in Calcutta. Didn't I think, this cop wanted to know, that ''Henry Esmond'' was undervalued and really better than ''Vanity Fair''?\nWhere else, I asked myself, could you have that conversation in a police station?\nIn this generation, the film maker Satyajit Ray has been the pre-eminent Bengali to achieve acclaim outside Bengal for his art. But more characteristic of Calcutta are the countless aspiring artists and writers who get neither recognition nor a living out of their work. There is probably no city in the world with more literary journals or drama groups thriving on sheer commitment.\nThe open horizons of Bengali conversation made a striking, even an inspiring, contrast to the claustrophobic conditions of Bengali life in an urban center that had known steady deterioration and decay since Kipling described it as a ''packed and pestilential town.'' But it also could be seen as escapist, a kind of Freudian dissociation from the fetid reality of Calcutta's streets. Sometimes I wondered whether the bottomless distress of the city might be somewhat alleviated if Bengalis were less outward looking, less given to great visions, better able to focus on their surroundings. It was a point Gandhi made in a classic riposte to Rabindranath Tagore, the great Bengali poet, who had criticized the Mahatma's call for noncooperation with all British institutions as a turning away from modern enlightenment. Gandhi wanted Indians to spin their own cotton as a symbol of self-reliance. ''Poems I can spin, songs I can spin, but what a mess I would make, Gandhiji, of your precious cotton!'' Tagore complained.\nGandhi replied with tenderness for Tagore, but sternly. ''The hungry millions,'' he wrote, ''ask for one poem - invigorating food.''\nAlthough it was a telling answer, it remains hard to see how the Gandhian solution could have transformed Calcutta. The question was whether any conceivable movement or social organization could begin to cope with such mass poverty. Or had the Bengalis been dealt a hopeless hand? The issue was raised to the status of an urgent international problem by the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. For anyone given to nightmares about population explosions or landless rural masses, the new nation seemed to offer a frightening prevision of what might be in store. ''Malthusia,'' an economist dubbed it. The phrase that stuck has been variously attributed to John Kenneth Galbraith, Henry Kissinger and U. Alexis Johnson, one or all of whom described the new nation as an ''international basket case.'' and U. Alexis Johnson, one or all of whom described the new nation as an ''international basket case.''\nYou may ask why Bangladesh was a worse idea than tattered, crazy-quilt Pakistan, but Western diplomats and development economists had gotten used to the idea of Pakistan and the influence they could wield there. They also saw at once that Bangladesh would inevitably become a major and permanent client for international assistance. Here was a country that, according to one calculation, had the same density of population that the United States would have if every last person in the world were corralled within its borders.\nNone of these forebodings, however, left an impression on Bengali minds, which were briefly in a state of rapture. ''Epar Bangla, opar Bangla'' (''This side Bengal, that side Bengal''), crowds in Bengal chanted, overlooking some uncomfortable facts - that the collapse of Pakistan left the boundary between the two Bengals unchanged, and that Hindus and Moslems alike had failed to rally to the idea of a united and independent Bengal when it was briefly floated in 1947.\nIn Bangladesh, nevertheless, Calcutta's emotion was requited. The new nation was overwhelmingly Moslem but chose for its anthem a Bengali poem of Tagore, a Hindu, who also was the author of the Indian anthem. ''Amar sonar Bangla'' (''My golden Bengal''), this hymn begins, evoking a land of endless fertility and tranquillity, an ideal Bengal that remains very much alive in the Bengali imagination.\nGOLDEN BENGAL, THE BASKET CASE. THESE contradictory visions have remained superimposed on each other. Yet the first 14 years of Bangladesh's history have borne out neither the worst fears nor brightest hopes that accompanied its birth.\nThere were famine conditions in 1975 - they helped set the stage for the assassination that year of Sheik Mujibur-Rahman, ''the father of the nation,'' who died in a hail of bullets along with 14 members of his family - but food production, incredibly, has kept pace (in the last few years, more than kept pace) with population growth. Incredibly, because there are now 100 million or so Bengalis, about 30 million more than there were just 14 years ago, and yet self-sufficiency in food grains is a goal that is likely to be achieved the next time the country can toil its way through several consecutive growing seasons without disastrous floods or another cyclone.\nIt's a very modest success story, one that is unlikely to give global doomsayers much pause so long as Bangladesh, with a population growth rate of 2.5 percent a year, continues to bulge against its borders. (India has actually contemplated building an electrified fence to thwart the leakage of Bengalis across the border into the troubled province of Assam.) Still, it is worth trying to understand how the food deficit has been contained and what this means to the rural poor, that 70 percent of the rural population that has to subsist on only one or two acres, or no land at all. As population pressure mounts, Bangladesh survives by farming smaller and smaller fragments of land more and more intensively. It survives, too, by making hitherto unthinkable adjustments in its traditional diet; the poorest, having no choice, have learned to eat wheat in place of rice. And it survives because foreign aid - about $1.7 billion a year in commitments, somewhat less in actual spending - exists to double hard-currency resources that these days depend heavily on the export of labor to the Persian Gulf: Bengali workers now rival jute as Bangladesh's chief export.\nA rice economy can sop up a rising population and forestall starvation because there is almost always room for more labor, even on the smallest pieces of land. But it does so in conditions of ''shared poverty,'' as anthropologist Clifford Geertz once put it. He was thinking of Java but the phrase applies to Bengal, where the number of those living at the margin of existence rises steadily in the absence of famine.\nIn these dismal circumstances, independence for East Bengal has not given Bengalis the sense that they are masters in their Golden Bengal. The International Monetary Fund, World Bank and other aid donors who now jostle one another in Dhaka (formerly Dacca) with their own pet strategies and agendas can be said to have replaced the Moguls, British and Punjabis as the latest incarnation of foreign power. Three heads of the government have been gunned down by military claques, one of them only four days after his own coup. And the Bengalis - once stereotyped as a ''nonmartial race'' by contemptuous British categorizers - have watched rival factions inside the army seek to consolidate power in a parade of martial-law regimes.\nThe present leader, a cautious, uncharismatic general named Hussain Mohammed Ershad, played no role in the civil war of 1971, returning to Bengal from West Pakistan only after it was over. The mistrust of politics that has always characterized the Pakistani army, in which he and his associates were trained, is Pakistan's legacy to Bengal. There is a sad symmetry in the politics of the two Bengals. What remained of Bengal on the Indian side of the border, the shrunken province called West Bengal, was too small to exert much influence on the politics of India. (There are more than 750 million Indians, and only 56 million of them -roughly 7 percent - reside in Bengal.) Once it was said, ''What Bengal thinks today, India will think tomorrow.'' The phrase evokes irony now. So, going its own way, West Bengal has inured itself to fractious protest politics, electing a succession of putatively Marxist state governments that pay lip service to the goal of revolutionary transformation while failing to implement the most modest social reforms. ''My principle is all or none,'' declared Subhas Chandra Bose, Bengal's political hero who allied himself with the Nazis and Japan during World War II, and who died in a plane crash at war's end. Decades later, it is the ''none'' that seems to be expected.\nFractiousness and the politics of frustration are characteristic of Bangladesh, too, whenever the military lifts the lid - at one point there were 55 parties - and Maoist notions of rural mass mobilization remain fashionable in some intellectual circles. At various times, each of the Bengals has had up to four Communist parties operating simultaneously; occasionally they have conspired across the border in efforts to ignite rural revolution.\nThe scale of their problems and the sheer pressure of human numbers can be blamed for the assumption, seemingly common to the two Bengals, that they have lost control of their destiny. Or the 1947 partition can be blamed. If that won't do, it can be traced back even further, to 1912, when the British moved the viceregal capital from Calcutta -where it had been growing and simultaneously moldering for some 155 years - inland to Delhi, partly to diminish the influence of the difficult, radical Bengalis who were already experimenting with revolutionary violence. Wherever the Bengali sense of loss begins, it is enough to keep a tiny flame flickering before the icons of a united Bengal.\n''We Bengalis feel ourselves to be homogeneous,'' a poet from Bangladesh remarked in a recent conversation. ''We are one single whole.'' In Dhaka, where the best Bengali poetry is now being produced, writing pure Bengali becomes a kind of protest. Just as they did in the Pakistan period, writers resist pressure from Islamic fundamentalists and military censors to use more words of Persian and Urdu origins so as to cut themselves off from the predominantly Hindu literary elite on the other side of the border.\nThe idea of a united Bengal may not be quite dead, but it is hard to see how it would be a solution for the problem of mass poverty. Adding Calcutta's urban misery to Bangladesh's rural misery hardly sounds like a recipe for prosperity. India would certainly not want to annex Bangladesh - it has enough problems already - and, in any event, the genie of Bengali nationalism is already out of the bottle, often defining itself in proud antagonism to its larger and more powerful neighbor. So long as they remain apart, Bengalis will find it easy to remain sentimental about their shared identity. But there is usually a mental reservation. It is the suspicion, amounting to a certainty, that if they were ever reunited, their separate identities as Hindus and Moslems might pull them apart all over again in the competition for power, influence and jobs.\nWhat remains is the sense - nurtured by Bengalis through all the years of swelling population, land fragmentation, deteriorating living standards and postponed dreams - that something has to give. ''People want to survive,'' the poet said. ''The struggle for survival will lead them to do something. It could change the map again.'' If Bengali history is any guide, it might take only a cyclone, a famine or a flood."}, {"text": "BANGLADESHIS STRUGGLING TO RECOVER\n1985-05-29T05:00:00.000Z\nToday, four days after a cyclone devastated the lowlands of southeastern Bangladesh, thousands of peasant families on this tiny delta island were burying their dead and struggling for food and shelter in a landscape strewn with human corpses and carcasses of sheep and cattle.\nA military helicopter arrived in Urir Char for the third day in a row, bearing food as well as plastic sheets for the peasants to use for temporary shelter.\nGovernment Cautious on Toll\nUrir Char was one of several delta islands ravaged last weekend when a cyclone - the term used in the Indian Ocean region for a hurricane - hit, washing thousands of people away in its fury. Although there have been random estimates and guesses that tens of thousands may have died in the storm, Government officials have remained cautious about the actual toll.\nThe cyclone struck several places in the disaster prone islands and lowlands of one of the world's biggest deltas, where the Ganges and Brahmaputra River systems empty into the Bay of Bengal. A cyclone that struck the same area in 1970 is believed to have killed at least 300,000 people. [In Washington, American officials said the Government was contributing an additional $500,000 to relief efforts in Bangladesh and would make available ''thousands of tons'' of grain already in the country. [On Monday, the State Department said a preliminary contribution of $25,000 had been made.] 'Like a Big Wall'\nUrir Char itself - an island about two miles wide and 10 miles long -looked peaceful, muddy and green this afternoon. The sky was thick with low clouds and a strong, warm and humid breeze was blowing in.\nThe residents, however, were telling of the horror when the cyclone arrived.\n''The wave came like a big wall,'' said Mohammed Ibrahim, describing a storm-generated wall of water that he said had struck the island.\nMr. Ibrahim, 50 years old, speaking in Bengali, said that the wave was 15 to 20 feet high and that families held onto roofs and bamboo poles of their thatched huts in desperate efforts to keep from being swept away.\n''All of us thought we were being pushed into the river,'' said Ohidur Rahman, an elderly man wearing only a lungi, or skirt, that was caked with mud.\n''Everyone was clinging to the rooftops,'' he said, adding that when the wind shifted directions, many people were driven into the water.\nMany Washed Out to Sea\nBangladesh's President, Lieut. Gen. H. M. Ershad, who rules by martial law, said today that he believed at least 5,000 people died in the storm, and perhaps many more.\nThe counting of bodies was proceeding today, but Government officials said they believed that most of those who died had been washed out to sea.\nThe Government announced tonight that it had officially counted only 1,400 dead, but others handling relief efforts said they continued to believe that the number missing was 10,000 or more.\nIn addition, the Government said tonight that 14,000 cattle had died and that nearly half a million acres of crops, mostly jute and rice, had been destroyed.\nWarnings Reportedly Sent\nThe Government maintains that there was no failure of its early-warning system in predicting the storm. Rather, officials said the storm developed quickly on Friday. Radio warnings were sent out on Friday afternoon.\nBut in Urir Char, peasants said that they were too poor to own radios and that the storm and subsequent gigantic waves caught them by surprise. [A spokesman at the National Hurricane Center, a division of the National Weather Service, in Miami said the cyclone had been detected by satellite on Thursday. [No formal warning was sent to Bangladesh, the spokesman said, because that country has its own meteorological offices with comparable technology and ''all alerts went through them.'' [The meteorological offices in Bangladesh were also in touch with United States Air Force personnel stationed there, the spokesman, Noel Risnychok, said. ''The information was there,'' he said. ''The problem was in informing and evacuating the communities.''] Some Shelters Were Built Several of Bangladesh's delta islands have concrete structures built in the last few years for cylcone emergencies, and a visit to one such island, Manpura, suggested that the structures helped save some lives. But the storm hit an area of ''new'' islands that have fewer such structures.\nOnly a few hundred people actually made it to the concrete buildings, and they, too, said they felt they were going to be washed away as the tidal bore - a series of waves created by a cyclone or hurricane - pushed in.\nReporters were brought to Urir Char by the military helicopter today. On the way, at least 15 human corpses could be seen scattered in empty fields that were once croplands but are now covered with mud. Many more hundreds of carcasses of cattle and sheep littered the area, a good part of which was used for grazing.\nUrir Char residents were making do with some Government assistance, including rice, tins of food and cannisters of drinking water. The villagers said that the Government was helping in the construction of new wells, but that many people had to rely on the salty water that was left the fields because the existing wells were destroyed.\n''We don't even have cloth to wear or a shed to live under,'' Mr. Rahman said. ''All our houses have washed away.''"}, {"text": "31 KILLED IN COLLAPSE OF ROOF AT UNIVERSITY IN BANGLADESH\n1985-10-16T05:00:00.000Z\nThe roof of a university dormitory collapsed on hundreds of students during heavy rain tonight. Officials said 31 people had been killed, and other reports said more than 100 were dead.\nHundreds of tons of girders and cement crashed down on about 500 Dhaka University students who were watching a popular television program at about 9 P.M. The building was undergoing repairs.\nOfficials said 31 people, mostly students, had been killed. But two English-language newspapers, The New Nation and The Daily News, reported that at least 100 people were feared dead and 300 injured.\nWinds Up to 93 Miles an Hour\nThe storm bore down on Bangladesh and southeastern India tonight with wind gusts reported at up to 93 miles an hour. Thousands of people were evacuated from offshore islands and coastal districts. Torrential rain and high seas lashed the region.\nMany of those injured at the university were reported to be in critical condition. State television appealed for blood donations, but many students who answered the call said hospitals were not able to handle the influx of donors.\nDhaka's three main civilian hospitals were packed with victims, brought in by ambulances or by fellow students carrying people on their backs because of a shortage of stretchers.\nSome of the most seriously injured were taken to a military hospital.\nRescue operations were hampered by the rain, lack of equipment and a lack of power in the ruined building.\nCrane Used to Clear Rubble\nThe army brought in a large crane to help clear the rubble. Muniruzzman Badal, president of university's student league, said many bodies still were buried.\nA doctor at Dhaka Medical College hospital said: ''It is horrible. We are confronted with a gigantic task.''\n''There is an acute shortage of blood and medicine,'' said a doctor at the Postgraduate Medicine Hospital. ''We need blood immediately to save many lives.''\nThe building, called the Jagannath Hostel, serves as a dormitory for minority Hindu, Buddhist and Christian students.\nForecasters said the storm was moving toward the northwest late tonight."}, {"text": "ABDUS SATTAR, EX-LEADER OF BANGLADESH, DIES\n1985-10-06T05:00:00.000Z\nAbdus Sattar, the only elected civilian president in Bangladesh's 13-year history, died yesterday in the Suhrawardy Hospital in Dhaka. He was 79 years old and was admitted to the hospital last month with heart and kidney problems.\nMr. Sattar was buried with full military honors by the Government of President H. M. Ershad, the general who deposed Mr. Sattar five months after his landslide election victory in November 1981.\nA political centrist, Mr. Sattar, who was born in Dhaka and graduated form Calcutta University in 1929, began his career as an attorney of the Calcutta High Court. At that time, Britain ruled India, and what is now Bangladesh was part of United Bengal Province.\nIn his youth, Mr. Sattar served as an aide to two prominent Bengali politicians, Fazul Haq and H. S. Suhrawardy, who worked for the autonomy of the Bengal region.\nPakistan's First Election\nAfter the partition of India and the formation of Pakistan as an independent nation in 1947, Mr. Sattar returned to Dhaka, the capital of East Pakistan, and joined the city's high court. He was named Minister of the Interior in 1956, and the next year was appointed a judge of the East Pakistan High Court. Later, he was appointed to the Supreme Court of Pakistan.\nIn 1969, President Agha Mohammed Yahya Khan appointed Mr. Sattar Pakistan's chief election commissioner to prepare for the country's first general election, which was won by Sheik Mujibur Rahman.\nPresident Yahya's refusal to appoint Sheik Mujib as Prime Minister and the subsequent struggle for the independence of East Pakistan led to the war between India and Pakistan in 1971. As a result of the war, which Mr. Sattar spent in Pakistan, East Pakistan became Bangladesh, an independent nation.\nAfter the war Mr. Sattar returned to Dhaka, where, despite his rising prominence, he led a quiet life with his wife. They had no children. Presidential Election in 1981 In 1975, President Ziaur Rahman appointed Mr. Sattar a special assistant, placing him in charge of the Ministries of Law and Parliamenatary Affairs. In 1977 he was named Vice President.\nAfter President Zia was assassinated in an attempted coup in May 1981, Mr. Sattar became Acting President. The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party unanimously named him its candidate for the next election, despite the fact that Mr. Sattar suffered from diabetes and high blood pressure.\nMr. Sattar won the election in November 1981 with 66 percent of the vote, but ill health prevented him from playing an active role. He was deposed by General Ershad in a coup in March 1982. At that time, he also handed over leadership of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party to President Zia's widow, Khaleda.\nFuneral services for Mr. Sattar were held in Dhaka's main mosque, and flags in the city flew at half-staff. President Ershad, who is on a state visit to Turkey, issued a statement from there eulogizing Mr. Sattar as ''one of the ablest sons of the nation.''"}, {"text": "IN ASSAM'S PASTORAL SETTING, BLIND HATRED THRIVES\n1985-12-06T05:00:00.000Z\nTawny sheaves of rice dot the fields of the lush Brahmaputra River valley nowadays. But this season the people are also reaping a harvest of anguish, recrimination and fear.\nEvery region of India has its share of sectarian rivalries, but few are afflicted with the hatred found here in the remote northeastern state of Assam.\nNearly three years after the fact, Assam, for example, still lives in the shadow of a massacre in which thousands of Moslem farm families were killed by tribespeople armed with guns, knives, spears and bows and arrows.\nIn the villages of Nellie and Ali Singha a few miles southwest of here, whole families were wiped out. ''We are always afraid the persecution will increase,'' said Moinul Haque, a 27-year-old grocer whose wife and daughter were slain.\nA Land of Great Beauty\nThe rancor seems an odd outgrowth in a territory as blessed with resources and beauty as Assam.\nThe land is covered with poinsettia trees, hibiscus bushes, coconut palms and bamboo trees. Violet hyacinths blossom in the marshlands. Tea plantations carpet the countryside. Fishermen in boats cast their nets in the Brahmaputra River, which flows here from its source in Tibet.\nWildlife abounds. People were talking, for example, about how a wild elephant got electrocuted the other day on a high-voltage power line.\nThe bitterness here has its sources underneath the surface.\nIn the volatile Assam population mix are people from a score of ancient tribes who migrated here thousands of years ago, some of whom live in the forested hills and practice their own animist religions.\nIn the cities, affluent Assamese Hindu families dominate the schools and professions. In the sprawling tea estates are low-caste Hindu workers whose ancestors were brought here 100 years ago by British plantation owners.\nThe cultures often mix peacefully. For example, on a forested hill overlooking the river sits a Hindu temple that hundreds of years ago was a shrine for one of the local tribes.\nAt dusk the sky turns pink and bells tinkle as Hindus gather to worship at an ancient rock that symbolizes the principle of female fertility.\nBut the most explosive element in the population mix are millions of Moslem Bengalis who for decades have been migrating here from what was once East Pakistan and is now Bangladesh.\nResourceful and enterprising, these Moslem families cleared thick tracts of forest and cultivated rice, mustard and jute. But often they crowded out the tribespeople already living in the area.\nThe Moslem immigration turned into a torrent after the India-Pakistan war of 1971. Today the flood continues from overcrowded Bangladesh.\nResentment of the newcomers set off a protest by students and other ''indigenous'' groups in 1979. It led to a boycott of state elections in 1983, with protesters demanding that newly arrived Moslems be barred from voting. Agitations and disruptions by the protesters that year fanned emotions across the state, resulting in the massacre of Moslems.\nThree months ago, seeking to end a crisis that threatened Indian national unity, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi reached a settlement with the anti-immigrant forces. But the accord has brought new bitterness and fear.\nUnder the agreement, perhaps a million Moslems are to be cut from the voting rolls and hundreds of thousands of these are to be ''expelled,'' although no one seems to know where they are to be sent. Bangladesh has said it will not take them back and last year its army skirmished with Indian authorities who started to build a concrete and barbed wire fence on the border.\nIn Moslem villages here, dozens of men said they had been thrown off the voter rolls even though their families had lived in this valley for decades. Apparently they could not prove they had lived here before the cutoff date of 1971.\nThose dropped from the rolls are now afraid that for lack of proof of citizenship they will be ousted from Assam altogether.\n''It is these people who are determined to get us out,'' said Narul Choudhary, a farmer, referring to Hindus and tribespeople. ''We live in fear that we will be harassed and uprooted and that our lands will be taken from us.''\nMoslems Feel Betrayed\nWhile many people in India praised Mr. Gandhi for reaching the Assam accord, Moslems here feel betrayed. In general, the Prime Minister is not a very popular figure here.\nMeanwhile, the anti-immigrant forces contend that there are still too many ''foreigners'' on the voter rolls and they began a marathon attempt in the fall to get them removed.\nMore than a million objections to individual voters were filed in the last few weeks alone by anti-immigrant groups, who apparently questioned the legitimacy of anyone with a Bengali or Moslem name.\nPeople of Nepalese origin were also challenged. Thousands of bureaucrats had to work through the night in cramped dusty offices to examine the claims.\n''I am satisfied that by and large the process is fair,'' said P. C. Misra, the state's chief electoral officer. ''But I will be a most happy man when this election is over.''\nLeaders and experts on all sides say that the people of Assam are tired of violence, but that peace depends on whether their interests are served in the coming months and years.\n''Immigration is a worldwide problem,'' said D. N. Bezboruah, editor of The Sentinel, a daily newspaper here. ''But millions of immigrants have come to Assam, and we cannot handle them all. Others must agree to share the burden.''"}, {"text": "PACT IN INDIA ASSURES SOME, INFLAMES OTHERS\n1985-12-04T05:00:00.000Z\nLast August Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi triumphantly announced a settlement in a bitter ethnic dispute that had cost thousands of lives in the northeastern state of Assam.\nBut now the carrying out of that accord is creating new bitterness and fears of violence in this remote region of India. What had been hailed as a victory for national unity has instead produced sharp new antagonisms between Hindus and Moslems.\nThe focus for the renewed friction is a state election scheduled for Dec. 16.\nIn 1983, the last time voting took place here, a long-simmering dispute erupted over the rights of perhaps half a million foreign immigrants, almost all of them Moslems from neighboring Bangladesh. Many of the immigrants had fled to Assam after the war between India and Pakistan in 1971.\nStudent groups and others called for a boycott of the 1983 election on the ground that hundreds of thousands of foreigners were being allowed to vote. Agitators blocked roads and attacked people conducting the balloting.\nIn addition, tribespeople, most of them Hindus who resented immigrants squatting on their land, went on a rampage armed with guns, spears, machetes and bows and arrows.\nAt least 3,000 Moslems who for years had peacefully tended their farms in the Brahmaputra River valley were killed. Some estimated the death toll was as high as 7,000.\nNow the Government has begun taking extra precautions to avoid a repetition of the violence next month. Tens of thousands of soldiers are expected to be brought in to patrol the area.\nMost people here agree that there will be little violence during the election itself. Unlike last time, no one is calling for a boycott and therefore no one is expected to try to disrupt voting.\nBut anger among various ethnic, religious and linguistic groups, as well as fears of possible future violence, seem as high as ever.\nToday the source of the anxiety is the accord reached last August between Mr. Gandhi and leaders of the six-year-old anti-immigrant movement.\nUnder the Assam agreement, perhaps a million immigrants are to be barred from voting or even deported from Assam altogether. While satisfying the agitation leaders, the accord has infuriated Moslems and has spread enormous fears that they will be expelled from their homes.\nCountless Moslem families assert that, because they cannot furnish the right papers, they have been disenfranchised already. These families now fear that the Government will soon try to take them from land they have lived on for decades.\nAssam, the size of Alabama, is home to 23 million people. Its core is one of the world's richest flood plains, and for 100 years it has attracted people, desperate to find land to cultivate, from crowded areas nearby.\nBecause of the area's history of violence, for years India has barred foreign visitors from traveling to Assam or neighboring states in the northeast.\nForeign reporters are now being allowed into Assam to observe the voting.\nTo prepare for the election, state authorities conducted a house-to-house survey and produced a list of 10.5 million voters.\nBut then Government investigators cut nearly a million voters from the rolls, most of them because they had immigrated to Assam after 1971. Then another 300,000 were cut when anti-immigrant agitators successfully challenged their eligibility.\nIn recent weeks about 600,000 voters won the right to get back on the election lists by proving they had lived here before 1971. But Moslem leaders say hundreds of thousands of their people have been improperly disenfranchised.\nAdding to the bitterness is the part of the Assam agreement that calls for all post-1971 immigrants to be ''expelled.'' In addition, several hundred thousand voters who came between 1965 and 1971 are to be disenfranchised for 10 years.\nA major question is how hundreds of thousands of people who arrived after 1971 are to be ''expelled.'' No one knows where exactly they are to go."}, {"text": "GANDHI AND SRI LANKA LEADER PLAN A JOINT BANGLADESH VISIT\n1985-06-01T05:00:00.000Z\nPrime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India and President J. R.

Indeed, she feels the series more than did justice to her prose, and she is already planning another television project.\nBack in the 1950's, after an unsatisfying year in a zoology lab, Dr. Goodfield found a way to join her passions for people and science by earning a doctorate in science history. She has spent the last two decades writing about the human side of medical research.\nIn 1981, while at New York's Rockefeller University, she ''set out to do for the 80's what 'The Microbe Hunters' did for the 20's,'' she said in a recent interview. That book, by Paul de Kruif, was an enthralling account of how Pasteur and others uncovered the hazards of dangerous germs. ''His book was overblown and romanticized, but it captured something important about science at that time,'' Dr. Goodfield said. ''It influenced generations of people to take an interest in science.''\nAs her book took shape, she was struck by the television potential of the stories and their settings. ''These are not tales told by talking heads in a lab,'' Dr. Goodfield said. ''They involve scientists face-to-face with people and suffering. And they are set in a variety of fascinating places.''\nThe locations of the stories are undeniably colorful. In the forests of Papua New Guinea, an American who won the Nobel Prize for his work there, Carleton Gajdusek, established that a horrifying brain disease afflicting a remote tribe was caused by a slow virus, transmitted by ritual consumption of the brains of deceased family members. In the Christopher Street area of Greenwich Village, more than 1,000 homosexual New Yorkers participated in a clinical trial of an unproven new vaccine for hepatitis B, an experiment of the sort that may one day be carried out for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).\nThe lush Caribbean island of St. Lucia was the setting for a 16-year inquiry into methods of controlling a snail-borne parasite that debilitates 200 million people worldwide. Scientists confront ancient prejudices and modern immunological mysteries at a leprosy clinic in the Himalayan foothills of Nepal. In the final segment, the events of 1974 in Bangladesh, where the global eradication of smallpox was finally accomplished, are relived.\nIn 1983, Dr. Goodfield took her idea to WGBH, the Boston public-television station, which enthusiastically embraced it, arranging for co-production with Video Arts Television of London and obtaining financing from four pharmaceutical companies. An independent British producer, Michael Latham, began working with Dr. Goodfield to transform her draft chapters into films.\nTo save money and time, the individual segments were shot simultaneously during 1984 by five different directors and crews. Dr. Goodfield, who raced from location to location during the filming, was co-writer of the series. She appears onscreen from time to time as an interviewer and, in a device intended to provide continuity, is seen in each location pecking away at a laptop word processor.\nDr. Goodfield acknowledges that she was startled when Mr. Latham observed that each hourlong segment, based on a 20,000-word chapter from her book, would include perhaps as few as 2,000 words of narration. But she feels the video medium conveyed her message well, and she has nothing but praise for the producer and crews she worked with. In fact, after shooting the films, she found herself rewriting her book, which will be published next month by Birkhauser Boston Inc.\n''It was quite extraordinary,'' she said. ''I had interviewed these scientists at least four times. But when we got them on location with each other and asked them to relive events for the camera, there was a vibrancy, and things came out they hadn't told me before.''\nOn St. Lucia, for example, she was filmed interviewing Peter Jordan, the British scientist who had directed the study of the parasitic ailment. ''Our noses were powdered and the camera was rolling,'' she recalled, ''and I asked him what it is like to have this disease. He said, 'June, you're not going to believe this, but my wife and I caught it in Tanganyika.'\n''I forgot all about the camera and said, 'I've seen you six times in the last three years and you wait until now to tell me this?' '' ''Cut!'' called the director. The re-gathering of the foreign and Bengali scientists who defeated smallpox in Bangladesh ''took on the air of a military reunion,'' Dr. Goodfield said. Brought together a decade after their victory, the old campaigners began to relive past moments in a way that none had in previous interviews.\n''The sheer trauma they had experienced began to come out,'' she said. The final year of the campaign had been filled with disasters for the nation, personal tragedy and professional frustration for the scientists. At what must have been the nadir, the morning after the tense, exhausted workers had celebrated what they thought was success at last at a cocktail party in Dhaka, a telegram arrived announcing that the virulent virus was again on the loose.\nFilming the segment in New York City required ''doing just what the medical researchers had done: moving from the quiet, antiseptic world of the lab to the garish, frenetic, absolutely unusual world of Christopher Street,'' Dr. Goodfield said. ''We were foreigners in a strange land.''\nDuring last year's Gay Pride Day parade, the film makers set up a street booth to re-enact one of the many unusual methods that had been used to recruit volunteers for the vaccine experiment in 1979. When the director asked one banner-carrying man for permission to film him, he at first demurred, saying, ''I don't know about this. I've come out locally, but not nationally.''\n''Well, now,'' said the director, ''here's your chance to come out internationally.'' The man agreed to be filmed. For a project that began as a look at the frontiers of medicine, the series wound up with a surprisingly strong orientation toward poor people in poor countries.\n''I'm a changed person as a result of this,'' Dr. Goodfield said. After coming face-to-face with the world's primary disease victims, her own interest has shifted toward health conditions among the world's poor.\n''I love to bring out the connections between our problems and those in the third world,'' Dr. Goodfield said. The greatest benefits from the tests of a hepatitis-B vaccine in Greenwich Village, for example, should come eventually in Africa, Asia and Latin America, where the disease is rampant and a major cause of liver cancer. That slow viruses can cause brain degeneration was established among New Guinea tribesmen; new lines of inquiry were thereby opened into the causes of Alzheimer's disease, a rising affliction in the West.\nIn the segment on Bangladesh, reporting on one of the greatest triumphs of medical science in history, Dr. Goodfield observes straightaway of the crowds on the screen that ''most of them are at the bottom of the heap, and that's where they'll remain for the rest of their lives.'' The scientific victory is not belittled, but the limits of its reach are made clear.\nNear the end of the Bangladesh footage, the camera freezes on the face of the girl, now 12, who a decade earlier had been the world's last reported smallpox victim. She, like the the rest of us, need never again worry about this killer, the narrator says. But she and her family now have other things to worry about, the voice adds. They lost their scrawny cows to a flood, they are squeezed by moneylenders, and hunger lurks constantly about their hut.\nThe girl, the living symbol of a global scientific success, looks straight into the camera, her expression matter-of-fact, and the narrator observes that for her, the eradication of smallpox ''was just one small step toward a better life.'' Her gaze into the camera is steady.\nDr. Goodfield's new orientation toward global poverty pulled her directly into another book project, on which she has already been working for five months. The topic is the current United Nations campaign to immunize all the world's children against polio, measles and other commonplace but preventable diseases. She hopes it will result in another television series and would like nothing more than to work with the same production team.\n''We all had a lovely time making this series,'' Dr. Goodfield said."}, {"text": "FOR BANGLADESH VICTIMS, 'NO PLACE ELSE FOR US TO GO'\n1985-06-01T05:00:00.000Z\nThousands of peasant families in search of a livelihood migrate each year to the low-lying fringes of this impoverished country. Once there, they say they will remain despite the hazard of being washed violently away.\nOn the tiny island of Urir Char, Mohammed Abdullah, 50 years old, with thick graying hair and a face of sad resignation, told why in simple terms this week.\n''We came here to start a new life,'' he said. ''There is no place else for us to go.''\nBound to Happen Again\nOne week after a cyclone devastated southeastern Bangladesh, killing perhaps 10,000 people, a major relief effort has begun. The first of $12 million in aid pledged by 13 countries has started to bring food, clothing, water and shelter to the suffering.\nYet, as the affected families struggle to put their lives back together, scholars, relief officials and the peasants themselves seem to agree on one thing: Such calamities are bound to happen again.\nThe story of the worst natural disaster here in 15 years, its consequences and the likelihood of a recurrence is more than a matter of one country's particular vulnerability to the ravages of nature. It is also a story of desperate poverty, tough political choices and corruption in one of the most densely populated parts of the world.\nThe Government has a policy of discouraging people from living on the islands, formed only recently by the silt deposits brought into the Bay of Bengal by the Ganges and Brahmaputra River systems.\nBut experts say wealthy landlords, eager to cultivate new land, routinely bribe local officials to be allowed to put settlers into the area. Some of the islands are so recently formed that they are barely a few feet above sea level, vulnerable to even moderate surges of the tide.\nIn a paradox typical of parts of the developing world, Bangladesh is a country whose scientists were able to interpret the ominous white swirl of clouds on an American satellite photograph on May 22, but whose subsequent broadcast warnings went unheeded, in part because many people were living in grass shacks in remote areas with no radios.\nSome who heard the radio warnings ignored them as another in a series of predictions over the years that brought no severe damage.\nPlots Are Fought Over\nBangladesh has a population of 100 million people packed into an area the size of Wisconsin. Its per capita income is $130 a year, one of the world's lowest. Every inch of its extremely rich soil is precious. Families engage in gang wars with knives and clubs over the tiniest plots.\nIn some cases, the fights are said to be encouraged by unscrupulous landowners who lease the land to more than one group of peasants and then let them fight for possession.\nFor relief officials, the tragedy of the the impoverished people drawn to the islands was driven home this week when the officials flew by helicopter to the muddy and barren wasteland left by the cyclone, the term used in the Indian Ocean region for a hurricane.\nUpon landing, the officials noticed that there were no children to greet them.\nChildren, who make up perhaps half the population of the islands, were apparently especially unable to cling to the bamboo poles or rooftops of their huts to avoid being washed away. Family after family told reporters of their losses. A 12-year-old girl named Roksane, looking dazed, said her mother and three sisters had drowned.\nRegion Now Looks Serene\nFrom the air, southeastern Bangladesh looked almost serene this week. But it was easy to see how susceptible the area is to the forces of nature.\nUnlike other low-lying countries such as the Netherlands, Bangladesh has no dikes and only the barest of early-warning mechanisms.\nThe lower islands have no villages and no roads. A wheeled vehicle, even a bicycle, would be useless. Narrow dirt pathways crisscross the rice paddies or fields. The people live in small settlements of huts built on dirt mounds. This week thousands of such mounds lay bare. Flattened thatched grass or bamboo poles were nearby.\nRelief workers said the only fortunate aspect of the storm was that there was little crop destruction. The most recent rice crop had been harvested. The land was thus being used for grazing cattle and sheep. But the loss of tens of thousands of animals, whose carcasses littered the landscape, was economically devastating.\nThe earliest reports of the cyclone suggested that tens of thousands of people had been killed, but the actual damage has turned out to be less than feared. In November 1970, a gigantic storm swept through the same area, leaving 300,000 dead, many of them migrants who had come to harvest the rice crop.\nSome Precautions in Place\nThe 1970 storm led the World Bank and other international organizations to pay for protective measures. Some of them were in place this year and helped to save lives.\nWith outside assistance, the Government of Bangladesh constructed hundreds of multistory concrete structures, built on stilts and used the year round for schools or Government offices throughout the southeast.\nTwo such ''cyclone shelters'' on the island of Urir Char saved hundreds of people who clambered to their roofs.\nIn addition, the Government has spent money putting up sirens, distributing radios, building up embankments and planting acres of mangrove forests on the islands. Even though these trees are still saplings in some places, a few people managed to survive by clinging to them.\nThis week, some people criticized the martial-law Government of Lieut. Gen. H. M. Ershad, who took power here in a coup in 1982, for failure to build more cyclone shelters, particularly in the most vulnerable islands.\n'Isn't Enough of Anything'\nSome relief officials, however, were philosophical about the Government's shortcomings.\n''There isn't enough of anything in this country,'' said William R. Joslin, acting director of the local office of the United States Agency for International Development, who had spent a day touring the disaster area.\n''There aren't enough cyclone shelters,'' he added. ''But there also aren't enough schools, transportation facilities, hospitals or roads.''\nThe Government announced late this week that it would spend at least some of the international relief money to erect more cyclone shelters. But some experts wonder if such a decision would only encourage people to live in a place where they should not live.\n''It is very expensive to build those shelters,'' Mr. Joslin said. ''In a country that can't afford to build schools, do you build a cyclone shelter for a once-in-10-year occurrence?''\nCriticism of Regime Eases\nOfficials said that some farflung islands had probably not been touched by the relief efforts, but that work in restoring normal life was proceeding. Newspapers critical of the Ershad Government started the week by trumpeting the failures of the relief program but later concluded that supplies seemed to be getting to the people.\n''By next season,'' Mr. Joslin said, ''their lives will be put together. These people are already scrounging for bamboo and building materials, putting back the remnants of their livelihood. They are hurt but not in shock.'' In less than six months, he predicted, the people who survived the cyclone will be joined by tens of thousands of others on the southern islands of Bangladesh, harvesting the next rice crop."}, {"text": "CYCLONE'S TOLL IS OVER 1,400 AND THOUSANDS ARE MISSING IN BANGLADESH COAST AREAS\n1985-05-27T05:00:00.000Z\nThe death toll from a cyclone that sent huge waves crashing into the islands of southeastern Bangladesh rose to at least 1,400 today, and officials and survivors said they feared that many more may have perished.\nOne official said the final toll could be in the tens of thousands, including large groups of migrant workers who had flocked to exposed islands to take part in the rice harvest.\nSeveral islands in the Bay of Bengal were reported to have been washed away in the cyclone Saturday, which created waves 10 to 15 feet high.\n'Beyond Description'\n''The devastation in the area is beyond description,'' said Lieut. Gen. H. M. Ershad, the country's President. General Ershad spoke after returning to Dhaka from the island of Sandwip, where he distributed food, clothing and medicine to survivors. He set out in a helicopter but had to complete the journey to Sandwip by sea because of strong winds.\nOfficials in General Ershad's office said at least 5,000 people had been injured in the cyclone.\nThe Ganges River estuary hit by the cyclone is about 168 miles long, dotted with about 1,000 islands populated by 8.5 million of the country's 95 million people. Waves washed over 400 square miles of land southeast of Dhaka, the capital. #300,000 in Islands for Harvest Officials said many of those who died were among 300,000 laborers who migrate to the coastal islands to help harvest rice every May.\nMany of the stricken areas remained inaccessible because of bad weather and rough seas. The officials said that with communications cut, there was uncertainty about the fate of three of the worst-hit islands, Urirchar, Liauhum and Monpura, where at least 20,000 people live. Monpura was virtually wiped out by a cyclone that killed at least 300,000 people in Bangladesh in 1970, when the country was still East Pakistan.\nOne man rescued from Urirchar, Rafikul Islam, 38 years old, said today that everything on that island had been washed away. Mr. Islam was rescued by boat with 11 other residents of his island, where 10,000 people lived. [At least 500 people from Urirchar were reported missing, The Associated Press reported.] Another survivor, Zohra Begum, 21, said a 15-foot wave crashed into Birbakh, the island 150 miles south of Dhaka from which she was rescued.\n''Everything on our island was washed away,'' Miss Begum said. About 5,000 migrant farm laborers were there for the harvest, she said. [Officials said at least 1,000 people were killed in the town of Noakhali and 50,000 people lost their homes when waves washed inland, driven by winds as high as 100 miles an hour, The Associated Press reported. [The Cyclone Control Center in Dhaka reported 181 dead in other areas of Noakhali district, 217 on Sandwip, 24 on the island of Dakhin Shahbazpur and 42 from Sonagazi in the district of Fenny. In addition, 200 to 300 people were missing in Sonagazi, and 6,000 were missing on islands near Noakhali, the A.P. said.] Fears of Far Higher Toll Officials who flew over some devastated areas in helicopters expressed fears of a vastly higher death toll.\n''If the death figures go beyond 100,000, I wouldn't be surprised,'' said one official. But he said the final toll may never be known with precision because the farm workers who migrate to the islands are unregistered.\nIn addition to those who were killed on land, hundreds were feared to have died at sea. Government officials said at least 10 fishing boats with 80 people were missing. A fishermen's association said 500 boats with more than 2,000 crew members were at sea when the cyclone slammed into the coast.\nTown Under 3 Feet of Water\nOn Hatia, one official said the cyclone had left the island's main town of 40,000 people under three feet of water and blown away at least half the thatched-roof homes. But only seven people were reported killed in the town.\nOn Dakhin Shahbazpur, a large island with one million inhabitants, officials said almost 70 percent of the dwellings had been destroyed.\nThe cyclone also took a high toll of livestock. Officials said 15,000 head of cattle had been killed."}, {"text": "NEWS SUMMARY\n1985-05-26T05:00:00.000Z\nSUNDAY, MAY 26, 1985 International Talks on northwest Pacific air safety have made ''some progress'' in unpublicized negotiations between the United States, the Soviet Union and Japan, Reagan Administration officials said.

Even tourists are affected by the problem. Hikers and trekkers in the Mount Everest region are now required by the Government to take along kerosene for fuel, since the region has been largely denuded of trees.\nNepal's environmental problems and glories could be seen on a recent eight-day hike through the Helambu region, stretching north of Katmandu to the Langtang Mountain range near the Chinese border.\nSentries in the Clouds\nThe higher altitudes were filled with rich alpine forests. Rhododendron trees exploded with red, pink and white blossoms. The snowy tops of the Himalayas stood like majestic sentries, cloaked with clouds.\nBut most of the foothills to the south were corrugated and terraced with small farms, as if someone had squeezed the skin of the landscape into endless brown folds. Whole sections of forests had been burned and cleared.\nIn general, the world awakened late to the ecological crisis in many mountainous regions, where rising populations of subsistence farmers led to the chopping down of forests for firewood and the cultivation of every inch of available land.\nNow, it is believed that the destruction of forests has led to soil erosion, ''desertification'' and in some cases starvation in large parts of Africa, Latin America and Asia.\nHere, on the southern edge of the world's tallest peaks, the problem has been especially acute. Each year, monsoons lash the area, speeding the erosion. Tons of silt then get washed into the rivers of northern India and Bangladesh, bringing floods and more human misery.\n'May Be No Answers'\n''It may be that there are no answers,'' said Kumar P. Upadhyay, chief soil-conservation officer in the Nepal Government. ''In some parts of Nepal, I don't have good hopes about solving this problem. But in other parts, I hope we can reverse the trend by the year 2000.''\nThe question is whether Nepal can afford to wait that long. It is already running out of places for farmers to cultivate, and the land that is farmed is becoming overused and increasingly unproductive. Meanwhile, the country's population of 16 million is growing at a rate of 2.6 percent a year.\nUnlike other parts of the world, Nepal's difficulties have not been overlooked. Starting in the mid-1970's, environmentalists began sounding the alarm about what was happening in the foothills of the Himalayas. Books, articles, films and television documentaries helped dramatize the problem in the West.\n''Everybody jumped in and wanted to help,'' an American expert here said. ''The problem is that not everything was well understood, and much that has been tried hasn't worked.''\nIncrease in Foreign Aid\nForeign aid, for example, increased sharply in Nepal in the last 10 years. In the early 1970's, the country received about $28 million a year in outside assistance. Now, it receives more than $200 million from the World Bank, various international lending agencies and many countries.\nThe United States has several ''reforestation'' projects in Nepal, and many of its 180 Peace Corps volunteers - one of the largest contingents in the world - are engaged in teaching the Nepalese how to save their environment.\nBut a succession of approaches to deforestation have foundered, in part because of Katmandu's inability to persuade desperately poor villagers of the desirability to conserve.\n''Until recently, even the intellectuals of Katmandu were unaware of the ecology and environment,'' said Prachandaman Shrestha, a Government tourism official. ''So what can we expect of the people in the villages?''\nEarly on, the Government tried nationalizing the forests, saying they belonged to the King. But that only led villagers to burn down the forests to make way for farms, since farms could be owned by the villagers themselves.\nHuge Reforestation Projects\nAfter the awareness of the problem increased 10 years ago, the Government received foreign assistance to carry out huge reforestation projects. Many acres were planted, but there was no way to prevent villagers from burning or cutting them back.\nOnly recently has the Government realized that it needs to enlist the cooperation of the people by giving them tangible incentives to keep the forests.\nA new concept - the ''community forest'' - grew up, in which villages were encouraged to see forests as a replenishable resource to be cultivated for fodder, limited amounts of fuel and other purposes.\nNew types of trees were planted with fast-growing leaves and branches that could be harvested to feed cattle. ''They don't look as good as the trees they replaced,'' the American official said. ''They're not straight, and they're scraggly, but they do the trick.''\nBut ''community forests'' are by definition time-consuming to develop, since each one requires painstaking work with a village. As a result, some aid experts worry that the West will grow impatient with the slowness of progress in Nepal.\n'Making a Dent'\n''I think we're making a dent, but I admit that it's not that noticeable,'' the American expert said. ''The middle hills of Nepal are losing forests, but at a decreasing rate.''\nNepalese officials said they would soon step up their use of another new concept, that of ''leased forests,'' in which private entrepreneurs would be able to reap the economic benefits.\nIn effect, the Government is trying to see if the marketplace can provide incentives to conserve.\n''Market forces are what's important now,'' Mr. Upadhyay said. ''So is political will, but you can't count on that. I would prefer to count on the market in preserving our forests. If we can promote these new models, some of these programs might click and really take off.''"}, {"text": "RISING RENTS THREATENING 'LITTLE INDIA'\n1985-08-25T05:00:00.000Z\nThe area of spice bazaars, sari shops and curry restaurants on the East Side of Manhattan known as Little India is beginning to feel the gusts of changing times.\nThe strip, concentrated along Lexington Avenue between 27th and 30th Streets, faces sharp rent increases, new competition from other Indian centers - mainly in Queens - and the erosion of traditions.\nSeveral Indian shops have been forced to close lately. Some shopkeepers are hanging on, but say they fear they will have to leave when their leases are up. Others, who own their buildings, are prospering and have opened branches in Jackson Heights, Queens, in what is now called Little India No. 2.\n''I'm afraid Little India is dying slowly because of the high rents, the difficult parking and all the new Indian stores in Queens, even New Jersey and Pennsylvania,'' said Raju Premi, who came here in 1970 with his wife and three daughters.\nMr. Premi and his wife, Chander, own the Anita Saree Centre on Lexington Avenue, between 28th and 29th Streets. She handles the saris on the ground floor and he operates an appliance store, with Indian cassette films and music upstairs.\nCommon Culture Stressed\nIn Little India, immigrants from South Asia have generally put aside their often bitter political rivalries, preferring to emphasize their common culture - the food, music and dress.\nThis year, however, some of the divisions appeared. Last Sunday, for example, Indians marched along Madison Avenue in the biggest Indian Independence Day Parade ever held in this country, but Sikhs, a minority that has clashed violently with the government in India, were conspicuously absent.\nPakistani merchants, who share the market place with Indians and Bangladeshis and usually do not object to being part of Little India, decided to hold today what has been called ''the first Pakistan Day Parade in the history of North America.''\nThe first food and spice store in what later became Little India - Kalustyan's, on Lexington between 28th and 29th Streets - was Armenian, - a reminder that the neighborhood was once called Little Armenia. Kalustyan's was established 50 years ago, as a supplier of Turkish and Middle Eastern spices, dried fruits, nuts, oils and grains, and expanded to cater to the Indian market, even bringing out its own brand of chutney and mango pickles.\nWhen Indians saw the long lines in front of Kalustyan's in the late 1960's, they began to open their own spice and sweet shops in the neighborhood. These were followed by Indian restaurants, and sari, art and appliance stores. Their owners did not live in the area, but generally settled in Queens, in Jackson Heights, Flushing and Elmhurst. #200 Indian Importers Indians began coming here in significant numbers after the liberalized immigration law of 1968 was passed. Although immigration has slowed recently, it is estimated that there are 400,000 Indians in the United States, with about 160,000 in the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut area. Many Indians here are either professionals or business people. There are some 200 Indian wholesale importers on Broadway, west of Little India.\nThree important shops have disappeared recently. And Shamiana, a modern Indian restaurant on Lexington at 28th Street, and the Taste of India, a food store around the corner, closed a few weeks ago because of high rents.\nEarlier, the popular India Food and Gourmet, on Lexington between 27th and 28th Streets, which specialized in teas, fell victim to the same forces.\n''We couldn't make it because we were paying $8,000 a month rent for the restaurant, but couldn't charge our clients luxury prices'' said Vineet Kapoor, manager of operations for Shamiana, which still runs a restaurant and a food store in Jackson Heights.\nMr. Premi said he did not know whether he and his wife could keep Anita Saree Centre when the lease expired in 1987. They were paying rent of $2,000 a month, he said, but landlords in the area are now asking $4,000.\nAbandoning the Sari\nMrs. Premi said that Indian women in this country had begun to abandon the sari, a graceful, floor-length gown, mainly because ''they don't want to stand out,'' although it is still worn at important occasions such as weddings.\nSayedul Alam, a Bangladeshni and part owner of the self-service restaurant Curry in a Hurry on 29th Street is also pessimistic. ''We're holding on but we don't know what will happen when our lease is up in five years because they're asking midtown rents and we can't charge midtown prices,'' he said.\nMr. Alam's restaurant benefits from the partronage of many of the Americans who work in the area, but he said his spice shop, the Spice and Sweet Mahal, around the corner on Lexington, is having difficulties because it caters to Indians, who prefer to shop in the new neighborhood stores in Queens, where many of them live.\nIndian consumers still demand piquant spices and foods, although children born here tend to disdain the traditional fare, according to Thomas Cherian, manager of the Annapurna grocery.\nOne sign of hope for businesses in the area may be in adjusting to changing tastes. Indian Express had difficulties as a fast-food restaurant and so became Indian Expression, switching to strictly vegetarian food last year and is doing better as the only such retaurant in the area, according to the manager, Nilan Constance, from South India."}, {"text": "FOOD NOTES\n1985-01-30T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Big Freeze\nWhat is happening to fruit and vegetable prices as a result of the recent freezes that have attacked the Southeast, especially Florida? The answer depends on whom you talk to, with optimism and pessimism in almost equal balance.\nMichael Pflueger, the United States Department of Agriculture representative at the Hunt's Point wholesale market in the South Bronx, said he had not seen an acute shortage of citrus so far. ''I think the bulk of the harvest has been made,'' he said, although he noted that late-season Valencias, the largest and most important crop for juice, are still on the trees. ''Late winter and early spring is when you'll probably see a real shortage of juice oranges,'' he said. Mr. Pflueger said the wholesale price of oranges had risen from $10 to $12 a hundred a week ago to $12 to $13 a hundred at the start of this week.\nMr. Pflueger suggested that Florida's vegetable crops, especially beans, eggplant, peppers, squash and tomatoes, would be harder hit by the freeze. ''These crops are much more susceptible to cold,'' he said. ''Once you kill a pepper plant, that's the end of it.''\nMr. Pflueger said the strong dollar attracts produce from alternative sources in Central America, the Caribbean and especially Mexico. Juice oranges from Jamaica, with a good size and flavor and a price comparable to that of Florida produce, were in the market this week, and Mexican vegetables are showing up in abundance. ''With peppers coming in from Mexico, the price can be as low as $15 a bushel,'' he said. ''Without Mexico they could go as high as $28 or $30.''\nBut wholesale and retail produce dealers disagree with Mr. Pflueger on the prospects. Noting that Mexican produce always comes in at this time of year, they say its arrival will not buffer the effects of the freeze. At Fairway Fruits and Vegetables at 2127 Broadway (at 74th Street) and at Balducci's at 424 Avenue of the Americas (between 9th and 10th Streets), managers of produce departments said that as a result of freeze damage, the quality of vegetables is poor and prices are high and expected to go higher. ''Tomatoes were hurt the worst,'' said David Sneddon of Fairway. ''Mexican fruit is starting to come in, as usual, but the Florida freeze is still going to be reflected in prices.''\nPrices of peppers and tomatoes in retail markets have gone from around 69 cents a pound last week to around $1.29 this week, and fancy peppers at Balducci's rose from $2.49 to $3.98 a pound.\nAsked how high she thought prices would go, Roni Okun, a wholesale dealer at Hunt's Point, said: ''It's a question of how high is up. There was a very immediate, very spontaneous jump last week, but it went too high too fast.'' If prices rise too much, the number of buyers fall, she said, adding, ''Everything was plentiful in the market last night - except customers.''\nWarehouse Sale\nFlying Foods is a wholesale importer of luxury and gourmet foods shipped into New York by air from all over the world - items such as blue prawns from Hawaii, black truffles from the Perigord, Prince melons from New Zealand and, in a new departure, tulips and freesias from the Netherlands. Now the youthful enterprise is going public, at least on a part-time basis.\nThe firm's Long Island City warehouse (in the Percy Bysshe Shelley Building, 43-43 Ninth Street) is open to the public on Fridays from 10 A.M. to 3 P.M. Prices are the regular wholesale prices (which vary with the availability of goods) and all sales are on a cash-and-carry basis - that means no credit cards. Michael Bergen, the manager, said Flying Foods could not guarantee that any particular item would be available on a given day. But what shoppers might find, in addition to the above, is Dover sole, turbot, loup de mer, langoustines, venison, foie gras, duck breasts, black and red currants, baby vegetables, haricots verts and an assortment of wild mushrooms.\nThe Percy Bysshe Shelley Building is easily reached from Manhattan by car, across the Queensboro Bridge, or by subway, an IRT No. 7 train to Vernon and Jackson Avenues or an E or F train to 23d and Ely Avenue.\nSpare That Frog\nThe World Wildlife Fund is asking restaurant owners and hotel chefs to stop using frogs' legs from Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. In 1983, the United States imported 5.4 million pounds of frogs' legs. That is approximately 54 million frogs, most of them Indian bullfrogs, a species that inhabits the rice paddies of southern Asia.\nAccording to the World Wildlife Fund, the frogs are exported, primarily to the United States, Europe and Australia. Exports from Bangladesh alone in 1983 totaled 70 million frogs. Therein lies a problem, says the international conservation organization, for 70 million frogs eat 100 tons of insects daily, many of them malaria-bearing mosquitoes. With the frogs gone, the mosquitoes proliferate, leading to what the wildlife fund calls ''the uncontrolled use of expensive and dangerous pesticides'' and the potential for ecological disaster.\n''In Bangladesh,'' said Elizabeth Kemf, editor of W.W.F. News, the group's bimonthly publication, ''the cost of importing pesticides far exceeds revenue earned'' from frog exports. She said that in West Germany, 250 restaurant owners and hotel chefs already had agreed to stop using the frogs.\nElegance to Go\nAs You Like It is the name of an elegant but homely takeout shop located in TriBeCa, amid warehouses and loading platforms at the corner of Hudson and North Moore Streets. Margaret Hess, a gifted self-taught cook, owns the shop, supervises the kitchen and cooks many of the items herself. The shop once suffered from a lack of expertise in what restaurateurs call ''the front of the house,'' but that problem seems to have been solved recently. ''I used to have managers who wanted to be dancers or actors or Buddhists,'' Mrs. Hess said. ''Now I have a real food person in front.''\nEverything at As You Like It tastes good, simple and fresh, as ingredients are combined in a straightforward manner that makes no attempt to disguise. The humblest chili ($10 a pound), richly spiced and generous with chunks of beef, is graced with soft kernels of parched hominy, and an elegant boned roast of lamb ($14 a pound), pink and tender, is stuffed with a delicate and contrasting farce of parsley, shallots and garlic.\nA delicious, subtly curried cream of carrot soup is $3 a pint, and two salads sampled recently were remarkable for their freshness and the delicate touch of dressing. Thin little haricots verts in vinaigrette, and a brilliant winter salad of m^aches, red and white chicory, sliced shiitake mushrooms and slivers of red pepper were both $3 a quarter-pound. Desserts include lovely, dark, bittersweet brownies ($2.50 with nuts, $2 without), sweet-sour lemon tarts ($2.50) and baked apple, sweetened with thick, brown Vermont maple syrup ($1.50). Mrs. Hess also makes excellent ice creams at $4 a pint, except chocolate, which is $4.50.\nThe shop is at 120 Hudson Street. The phone number is 212-226-6654."}, {"text": "DIET DEFICIENCY OF VITAMIN A IS REVEALED AS A MAJOR KILLER\n1985-09-03T05:00:00.000Z\nDIETARY deficiencies of vitamin A, long implicated as a cause of blindness, have now been linked to hundreds of thousands of deaths of children each year in Africa, Asia and Latin America.\nNew findings, described by one expert as ''electrifying'' in their implications, are galvanizing international efforts to combat the deficiency. The studies indicate that the vitamin deficit, which is widespread in the third world and a major cause of blindness there, is also responsible for significant increases in measles, diarrhea and other potentially deadly diseases among tens of millions of children.\nInternational health officials are developing a plan they hope will eliminate the deficiency worldwide and, in the process, reduce childhood deaths. Experts said the findings had already rejuvenated flagging vitamin therapy programs in Bangladesh and other Asian countries.\nEarlier this year, the highest incidence of vitamin A deficiency ever recorded in any population was discovered in famine victims trekking into feeding camps in Ethiopia and the Sudan. Relief officials mounted a quick response, one of many largely unheralded subplots in the larger dramas of life and death in Africa that have caught the world's conscience over the last year. Since March, physicians say, airlifted shipments of high-dose vitamin A capsules to Ethiopia and the Sudan have saved thousands of children from certain blindness and from increased illness.\nOn the Indonesian island of Sumatra, where inadequate consumption of vitamin A is commonplace, death rates among small children receiving vitamin A therapy were one-third lower than among other children in equally poor circumstances who did not receive the supplements, according to the most recent and conclusive of the studies linking the nutrient deficit to excessive mortality.\nThat insufficient vitamin A can damage eyesight has long been established. In ancient Egypt and Greece observers noted that the eyes of young children sometimes withered when they consumed an unvaried diet. Today the World Health Organization estimates that half a million children in Africa, Asia and Latin America are permanently blinded each year by xerophthalmia, from the Greek for ''dry eye,'' resulting from inadequate vitamin A. Millions more suffer the lesser, and reversible, debility of night blindness, which causes children to stumble about at twilight. Nutritional blindness has essentially disappeared from the developed world, where diets meet minimum needs for the nutrient.\nAlthough health officials have recognized nutritional blindness as a severe problem for decades, they have seldom granted it high priority when dispensing scarce health funds.\n''When the main concern was night blindness, health ministers said, understandably, 'I feel terrible about that, but I can't put my resources into it when half our children are dying before the age of 5,' '' said Dr. Alfred Sommer of Johns Hopkins University, who directed the Indonesia studies. But now, he said, in view of the evidence linking inadequate vitamin A to heightened mortality, ''ending the deficiency is starting to be viewed as a mainstream activity, not a peripheral one.''\nThe ''electrifying'' new evidence, said John H. Costello, director of Helen Keller International, ''has rekindled interest in the vitamin A problem'' among aid agencies such as the United Nations Children's Fund, which finances projects to promote the survival of children, and among third world governments. Helen Keller International, in New York, is the main private group working to prevent nutritional blindness. In Washington, legislation is pending that would more than double the Agency for International Development's vitamin A programs, to $8 million a year.\nDr. Nevin S. Scrimshaw, professor of nutrition at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, called the Indonesia findings ''very important.'' He said the findings had created new enthusiasm for the global strategy to eradicate vitamin A deficiency being promoted by the World Health Organization, which is now trying to raise $25 million for the first five years of the program. Many experts believe that, through vitamin-capsule distribution, nutrition education and fortification of foods with the vitamin, the deficiency could be largely eradicated even without deeper social progress.\nAccording to Dr. Sommer, 5 million to 10 million children develop night blindness or more severe effects of vitamin A deficiency each year, and an additional 20 million suffer more subtle deficiencies that impair their health. In Asia, the deficiency has been found to be rampant in India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand; little is known about rates in China. In Latin America the deficiency remains a threat in Haiti and isolated pockets elsewhere. Almost nothing is known about the adequacy of vitamin A in African diets, though fragments of evidence indicate a vast problem.\nFirst Sign Is Night Blindness\nThe first overt sign of the deficiency is night blindness. Native names for this condition in Indonesia, India and Bangladesh mean, literally, ''chicken eye.'' Its victims, like chickens, which lack ocular mechanisms for vision in low light, tend to walk erratically in the evening dimness. Night-blind children, physicians say, often spend twilight time sitting silently in a corner to avoid embarrassment. In more advanced stages, the whites of the eyes becomes rough and wrinkled. Then the corneas dry and scar, impairing vision, and finally the corneas rupture, leaving the victim totally blind.\nThe primary victims are the children of the poor and landless who have least access to the green leafy vegetables, fruits, milk, eggs, liver and fish that provide the vitamin. Cultural practices often accentuate the problem. Mother's milk provides vitamin A but postweaning diets often do not. In Indonesia, most adults consume green vegetables but tend not to feed them to small children. And in Bangladesh, girls are less susceptible than boys because they nibble on vegetables, not generally fed to children, as they stir cooking pots.\nExactly how the deficiency promotes potentially deadly diseases is unclear. Experts said it might suppress the immunological system either directly or indirectly by interfering with iron metabolism, which in turn debilitates the white blood cells that attack invading disease agents. Evidence also suggests that the deficiency causes a hardening of mucous membranes in the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts as well as around the eyes. As these normally moist tissues become skinlike and cracked, a process known as keratinization, they may provide microbes with easy pathways to vulnerable organs.\nDuring food shortages, vitamin A intake sometimes actually improves as desperate people turn to eating nutrient-rich leaves from the environment. But during severe famines and where the landscape is barren, as in parts of Africa in recent years, a chronic, subtle deficiency of the vitamin can quickly be transformed into an open ravager of eyesight. Scientists presume that the lengthy drought afflicting Ethiopia, the Sudan and other African countries has exacerbated a pre-existing dietary deficit of vitamin A. Ethiopian tribes have 27 different names for night blindness, indicating long familiarity with the problem, Dr. Sommer noted.\nLast winter, as emaciated drought victims arrived at feeding centers in Ethiopia and the Sudan, veteran relief officials noticed signs of eye injury and called for an expert appraisal. In January doctors from Helen Keller International visited 10 centers in the two countries. They were appalled by what they saw: In some camps nearly 10 percent of the children showed advanced forms of eye damage such as dry patches and corneal scarring, the highest rates ever recorded anywhere. ''It is certain that many children in East Africa have become blind and thousands more are in danger of becoming blind,'' the physicians warned.\nBeyond suffering years of poor harvests, many famine victims from warring regions of Ethiopia had reached feeding camps in the Sudan only after weeks of walking through parched desert terrain. ''Those that made it to the camps had been without vitamin A for a very long time,'' said Dr. Victoria Sheffield of Helen Keller International, who recently returned from another assessment of conditions in East Africa. Once in the camps, people received little, if any, of the nutrient in their emergency rations; even vitamin-fortified powdered milk does not provide the nutrient at high enough levels to reverse developing cases of blindness.\nWithin a month of its alarming January report, the New York agency arranged for two million doses of vitamin A to be sent to the Sudan and Ethiopia. Three pharmaceutical companies donated the vitamin capsules, while another private aid group, Catholic Relief Services, and the United Nations airlifted them to Africa. Officials believe the problem is under control for now, but they worry about the deficiency's effects on millions more Africans who have endured years of drought but have not visited feeding centers or health clinics ready to counter the threat. #25,000 Children Studied In the late 1970's, while studying eyesight problems on the Indonesian island of Java, Dr. Sommer and colleagues found, ''quite unexpectedly, that children with night blindness were dying at a much higher rate than the children next door,'' he said. They found that, other forms of malnutrition aside, the more severe the vitamin A deficiency, the higher the mortality, mainly from increased rates of respiratory diseases and diarrhea.\nThe scientists, taking advantage of a vitamin therapy program about to begin in Sumatra, then carried out a more scientifically controlled study of 25,000 children in 450 villages from 1982 to 1984. The therapy could not be introduced to all villages immediately, so the scientists were able to compare health in half the villages, where children received megadoses of vitamin A every six months, with health in the other villages, comparably poor, that had not yet received the therapy. In the one-year interval between examinations of each child, they found that the death rate among those 2 to 6 years old who had received the capsules was 35 percent lower than that among untreated children. No other differences in health care or nutrition between the two groups could be discerned. Dr. Sommer presented the Sumatra findings last month to the International Congress of Nutrition in Brighton, England.\nDr. Barbara A. Underwood of the National Eye Institute in Bethesda, Md., who is a specialist in nutritional blindness, said that scientists had generally accepted the evidence linking vitamin A deficiencies with increased disease and death, but that the magnitude of that effect was still open to question. ''We are anxious to see this study replicated in other settings,'' she said."}, {"text": "ATTACH STRINGS TO EMERGENCY RELIEF\n1985-04-17T05:00:00.000Z\nGeorge Bernard Shaw observed, ''All great truths begin as blasphemy.'' With this philosophy in mind, I put forth blasphemy: the United States should give no emergency food relief to countries that are unwilling to adopt long-term economic reforms and population control programs.\nWhile it is enough to ''mean well,'' we also must ''do good.'' I question whether our nation - in spite of its best intentions - does good by merely giving temporary relief to Ethiopia and nations in similar circumstances. Sadly, neither America's grain bins nor its pocketbooks can possibly keep up with the demographics of starvation, in Ethiopia or anywhere else.\nThere are 535 million people living in Africa. If population growth rates continue on course, the continent will add 338 million more new mouths in 16 years. By the year 2020, there will be 1.2 billion people living on land that cannot adequately feed 535 million today. African farmers must feed about 20 million new mouths a year while American farmers, with vastly more capital and fertile land, must feed only two million new Americans. Productive as we are, it would be impossible for our nation to feed not only its own new citizens but the third world's new citizens as well.\nSooner or later, third world countries must come to grips with their population pressures. Try to write a happy scenario for Bangladesh, a poverty-stricken country with 96 million people crowded into an area the size of Iowa: the average woman has 14 pregnancies; 60 percent of the women bear seven or more children. Or try to write a happy scenario for\nWhile the sub-Saharan African population is projected to triple in the next 40 years, populations elsewhere in the world will burgeon, too. By the year 2000, Europe's numbers will have expanded 4.5 percent, our nation's by 14.5 percent, Latin America's by 44.6 percent, Africa's by 65.9 percent. These rates are unsustainable, even if we envision adding an international welfare load to our current domestic welfare program. Clearly, the stork will outfly the United States' generosity at some point. Our desire to help must be appropriately and realistically directed. If America gives short-term aid without insisting that recipient nations take long-term action to limit population and reform their economies, we merely throw gasoline on a fire. It is true that cultural and language barriers may make it difficult to convince other nations that population control must be part of the solution, that economic development will make a difference in their lives. But if we do not attempt to initiate long-term solutions, we'll only perpetuate the cycle of hunger. We'll only be keeping the hungry alive long enough to produce equally hungry offspring. The late Alan Gregg, a vice president of the Rockefeller Foundation, once said that overpopulation is a cancer and that he had never heard of a cancer that was cured by feeding it. We must insist that long-term solutions be in place before helping with short-term solutions. We must use both thinking heads and bleeding hearts. In the case of Ethiopia, the problem is more than a temporary shortage of food. Much of the land has been denuded. At the beginning of this century, vegetation covered 40 percent of the country; now satellite photos show that it covers only 4 percent. The United States should insist on ''reciprocal altruism'' in Ethiopia and elsewhere. If population growth is not brought under control, if self- reliance through economic development is not encouraged, we will merely multiply empty stomachs. Indeed, we will have ''meant well'' and intended to ''do good.'' But we will have done harm. We will have delivered a sentence of misery to future generations."}, {"text": "FOOD SHOPS; IN PURSUIT OF THE PERFECT INGREDIENT\n1985-11-03T05:00:00.000Z\nFOR THE COOK WHO loves ethnic food, New York is a vast, rich, fascinating marketplace, where Polish dried mushrooms and Chinese winter melons, Mexican blue cornmeal and Vietnamese nuoc mam (fermented fish sauce) exist side by side in neighborhood markets Successive waves of newcomers have given New York foodways a unique character: Brazilian food may be better in Rio and Chinese food in Hong Kong, but in neither of those cities can you find the tremendous variety, the sheer exuberance, of ethnic food in New York. For a WASP like me, raised on the blandly nutritious food of New England, ethnic food means a chance to taste, explore and, above all, to cook from virtually all the cuisines of the world. With so many important end-of-the-year holiday meals coming up - not just Thanksgiving, Hanukkah and Christmas dinners but also the traditional feasts of Santa Lucia (Scandinavian), St. Basil (Greek) and the Three Kings (Hispanic), the Boar's Head Festival (Old English), the Russian and Chinese New Years - this is the perfect time to go in search of other cuisines. For some cooks, the pursuit of a single necessary ingredient is what the quest is all about, the chance to reward one's friends with an authentic national dish, Brazilian feijoada or a genuine Hungarian Szekely gulas, every element in place, the proportions balanced and the recipe evolved over long discussions with a purveyor of Brazilian or Hungarian food who still remembers what it tasted like in the old country and who has the contents on hand to prepare it that way.\nFor others, the fascination is in sampling the sheer variety and abundance of what is available. These are the people who seek out areas of the city where layers of immigration overlap like a torta rustica and a visitor can read the history of the city in the palimpsest of shop signs going from Italian to Eastern European to Greek to Spanish to Asian. The following guide is for adventurers in search of ethnic cuisines. While by no means complete, it is intended to satisfy both the seeker of the exact ingredient and the explorer undertaking an ethnic shopping experience just for the fun of it. One cautionary note: telephone ahead to see that a shop will be open when you arrive.\nAFGHAN The cooking of Afghanistan is a subtler and in many ways more interesting version of the cuisines of India, Persia and the Middle East, to which it is closely related. Spices and other ingredients for Afghan recipes can be found in many Indian and Middle Eastern shops, but one necessary element for an authentic Afghan meal is naan, the long, flat and floppy rectangle of bread that is used like a spoon to scoop up meats and sauces. The Afghanistan Kebab House, at 764 Ninth Avenue, between 52d and 53d Streets (307-1612), is a source for this fragrant bread, flavored with onions or garlic, or spiced with black caraway seeds.\nARAB AND MIDDLE EASTERN Brooklyn's Atlantic Avenue between Clinton and Court Streets is to the city's Middle Eastern population what Chinatown is to its Asian residents. Syrians, Lebanese, Palestinians, Armenians and Egyptians crowd the groceries, bakeries and restaurants, and stepping into one of these establishments is like entering Beirut's souq el-frang in the days before that wonderful market was destroyed. The haunting aromas of cumin, cinnamon, wild thyme and tangy sumac mix with the briny scents from barrels of olives - 16 different varieties at Shammas & Company, at 197 Atlantic Avenue (718 855-2455). Available also are an impressive variety of dried beans and pulses, including three different kinds of fava beans, chickpeas and lentils, wheat and cracked-wheat bulgur, frik (a kind of dried green wheat used by Egyptians), dried Egyptian meloukhia, a spinachlike green used in the classic Egyptian soup, several kinds of rice and flours of all descriptions, dried medjool dates, pink and tan pistachios, pine nuts, cheeses and yogurt and even Persian leaf tobacco. Sahadi Importing, at 187 Atlantic Avenue (718 624-4550), and Malko Importing, across the street at No. 182 (718 624-2049), are among the oldest of these food shops. At 183 Atlantic, down a steep flight of stairs, the Near East Bakery (718 875-0016) makes its own flat rounds of Arab bread; in the morning you can ask for one spread with a mixture of sesame seeds, wild thyme and sumac. The Damascus Bakery (718 855-1456), at 195, has delicious meat or spinach pies and lahm ajeen, a kind of Armenian pizza, and all the traditional Middle Eastern sweets, thick with honey and walnuts or pistachios.\nBRAZILIAN The cooking of Brazil is a combination of West African and Portuguese influences. Many of the ingredients can be found in Hispanic and Afro-American markets, but West 46th Street, in the block between Seventh Avenue and Avenue of the Americas, is the locus for New York's Brazilian population. International Latin American Products, at 142 West 46th Street (302-4323), has a very good selection of foods, including almost everything needed to make feijoada, a succulent combination of black beans, carne seca (Brazilian dried beef) and linguica (a Portuguese-style sausage). The shop also has manioc flour, bean flour, dark cornmeal from Peru and achingly sweet cocada, a Brazilian coconut fudge that comes in three flavors: white, burnt and shredded.\nBRITISH Country Host, 1435 Lexington Avenue, at 93d Street (876-6525), is a take-out shop specializing in British sweet and savory pies - Cornish pasties, raised pork pies and lemon-curd tarts among them. The shop also has a selection of English jams, jellies and other canned and bottled foods, plus plum puddings and mincemeat pies in December. Evan & Lewis , 11 Fulton Street (608-1344), on the ground floor of the Fulton Market building at the South Street Seaport, has a fine selection of English cheeses and Welsh Caerphilly. Myers of Keswick, 634 Hudson Street (691-4194), is a genuine English sausage and pork pie shop, where Peter Myers makes bangers, sausage rolls, shepherd's pies and raised pork pies from recipes handed down through his family, who have for the last three generations been butchers in the Lake District town of Keswick.\nCARIBBEAN The food of the islands is a spicy amalgam of Spanish, West African, French and native West Indian influences. One of the liveliest and most interesting sources for the very particular ingredients is La Marqueta, the vast covered market under the railroad tracks along Park Avenue from 111th to 116th Streets. Yams, yautia, calabaza squash, coconuts and water coconuts (cocos de agua), plantains, breadfruit, banana leaves for wrapping sweets, fiery little peppers, tamarind, cactus shoots and sugar cane are among the fruits and vegetables offered in the stalls lining both sides of the market buildings. These are the foods of thrifty people, who put everything to use: pigs' snouts and ears, smoked and salted ham hocks, oxtails, calves' feet, tripe and tongue. It's a bustling and friendly place, particularly on a Saturday morning when the crowds are thick: ask about a vegetable you've never seen before and you will be given plenty of advice and a recipe or two, shouted over the market uproar.\nCHINESE On Sundays especially, when Asians from all over the metropolitan area flock to Chinatown for their weekly shopping, it takes no effort of the imagination to forget you're in New York. Out of the incredible array of shops selling lacquered duck, roast pork bellies, fresh meat and fish (carp, lobsters, whelks, live crabs and a tremendous variety of shrimp, as well as more common seafood), vegetables like winter melon, bitter melon, Chinese chives, fresh water chestnuts, taro and lotus roots, it is difficult to make a selection. Kam Man Food, at 200 Canal Street (571-0330), has a choice of Chinese tea, preserved vegetables and bottled condiments including red, black and yellow bean pastes, fish and shrimp sauce and hoi sin sauce. Wing Woh Lung, 50 Mott Street (962-3459), has an excellent supply of foods from many Asian and Pacific countries. A good spot for fresh fish, chicken and pork is Loong Won, 224 Canal Street (966-2524), where, on a recent visit, a young shop assistant presented a dramatic demonstration, in Chinese, of how to slaughter and butcher the live snapping turtles on sale there.\nCZECHOSLOVAK Czechoslovakian pork butchers are rare in the city since the once thriving Czechoslovak community has been assimilated, but the S&M Pork Store, at 35-10 Ditmars Boulevard (718 278-8468) in Queens, has Czechoslovak-style keilbasa, dark-smoked gypsy ham, and rich, meaty rib bacon, smoked with the bones still attached. The shop also makes its own jaternice and debrecine, hefty blood and liver sausages secured with thick wooden toothpicks at either end, for steaming and serving with sauerkraut and dumplings. The dumplings are there, too, ready for steaming or frying.\nGERMAN Yorkville, along 86th Street east of Lexington Avenue, was a thriving German community 25 years ago. Today little of that remains, but at Schaller & Weber, 1654 Second Avenue (879-3047), and at Karl Ehmer, 230 East 86th Street (535-2129), you can still find an enormous variety of German sausages, frankfurters, wieners, braunschweiger, blutwurst, bauernwurst, weisswurst, knockwurst, leberwurst and all the other wursts, great and small. Also in Yorkville are a few of the old pastry shops, especially Cafe Geiger, 206 East 86th Street (734-4428), and the Kleine Konditorei, 234 East 86th Street (737-7130). You can still see stout patrons having their morning or afternoon kaffee mit kuchen und schlag, strong Viennese coffee with fat gobs of whipped cream and elaborate cakes, like Black Forest cherry cake and Sachertort. Germans are famous for their Christmas baking, and in Yorkville at this time of the year you can buy gingerbread houses as elaborate as anything in Hansel and Gretel as well as spicy, honey-sweetened lebkuchen and anise-flavored springerle, buttery shortbread squares with patterns impressed on their surfaces by a wooden mold.\nGREEK There are still places in town that are indisputably old-world Greek, especially the portion of Astoria, Queens, around the intersection of 31st Street and Ditmars Boulevard (take the BMT RR train to the Ditmars stop). At Christmas and Easter the sweet shops and bakeries, like Lefkos-Pirgos (718 932-4423), at 22-85 31st Street, and the Hilton Pastry Shop (718 274-6399), at 22-06, offer Christopsomo, a sweet yeast bread scented with mastic and mahlepi, two unusual flavoring ingredients available in grocery shops here. The aroma of roasting kebabs and pungent salt cod and herring is pervasive as you shop for feta and haloumi cheeses, green and black olives, dark and viscous Greek olive oil and glass jars of exotic fruits - bergamot, pistachios, rose petals and figs - in heavy syrup. Try the Kiryakos Grocery (718 545-3931), 29-29 23d Avenue, or John's Fruit Market (718 278-0705), 31-27 Ditmars Boulevard, for these specialties. Butcher shops like the K & T Meat Market (718 728-3810), 33-14 Ditmars Boulevard, have kid, lamb, suckling pig, rabbits. You can also find ready-to-roast kokoretzi, the innards of the lamb, strung on a kebab skewer and wrapped with caul fat to baste the meat as it roasts over a charcoal fire. Ninth Avenue in Manhattan is another good source for Greek products. Poseidon (757-6173), 629 Ninth Avenue near 44th Street, specializes in baked goods, especially sticky sweets and savory tiropita, spanakopita and kreatopita - cheese, spinach and meat pies. If you want to make your own Greek specialties, this is also a good place for freshly made phyllo dough. At International Foods (279-1000) at 543 Ninth Avenue and International Grocery (279-5514) at No. 529, sacks of ground herbs and spices, turmeric, cayenne, paprika, black pepper, chili pepper and pungent wild oregano from the mountains attract passers-by. This is a good source for hard-to-find salted anchovies, tillio and mint for soothing infusions, grape leaves in brine, ready to be stuffed, dried salt cod and salted cod's roe tarama.\nHUNGARIAN Hungarian food means paprika, and both H. Roth & Son (also called Lekvar-by-the-Barrel), 1577 First Avenue at 82d Street (743-1110), and Paprikas Weiss, 1546 Second Avenue at 80th Street (288-6117), supply rich, rosy paprika in several strengths, as well as other ingredients for Hungarian and Eastern European cuisines. These two shops, crowded with barrels and bins and fragrant with 200 kinds of herbs and spices, are wonderful sources for the ingredients of such baked goods and confections as poppy seed guba and walnut-stuffed beigli, traditional Eastern European specialties at this time of the year. Paprikas Weiss also has imported Hungarian salami, only recently available in this country. Garlicky Hungarian-style smoked pork and sausages are available at Tibor Meat Specialties, 1508 Second Avenue at 78th Street (744-8292), and at the Yorkville Packing House, 1560 Second Avenue at 81st Street (628-5147).\nINDIAN Indian food - including Pakistani and Bangladeshi - is characterized by a greater variety of aromatic spices used in combination than any other of the world's cuisines. Little India, the area of Lexington Avenue around 28th Street, is permeated with the aromas of curry, turmeric, cumin, fenugreek, cloves and coriander, as well as a dozen other familiar and exotic spices. Shops like Annapurna,126 East 28th Street (889-7540), Spice and Sweet Mahal, 135 Lexington Avenue (683-0900), Kalustyan, 123 Lexington (685-3416), and Foods of India, 120 Lexington (683-4419), have all of them, plus chutneys and other condiments, lentils and basmati rice, hot sauces, pappadums in round, flat tins and other ingredients for this great cuisine.\nINDONESIAN Indonesian cooking, with its heritage from China and India overlaid by Arab and Dutch influences, is a miscellany of flavors. For the specialized ingredients to make the elaborate and traditional dishes that compose a rijsttafel, the Indonesian smorgasbord, try Wing Woh Lung, 50 Mott Street (962-3459), at the corner of Bayard in Chinatown. There you will find coconut milk, terasi (shrimp paste), krupuk (shrimp wafers) and sambals (hot pepper sauces).\nIRISH Mattie Haskin's Shamrock Imports, at 205 East 75th Street (288-3918), can supply the necessary ingredients for an Irish meal - or an English meal, for that matter. A small section of the shop, which also has a lovely collection of Irish knits and weaving, is devoted to such Anglo-Irish essentials as Bird's Custard Powder, Paxo stuffing mix, Bisto for making gravy, HP sauce, Ribena syrup and Heinz's salad cream, as well as John McCann's Irish oatmeal and a selection of Irish black teas.\nITALIAN Balducci's, the emporium at 424 Avenue of the Americas at Ninth Street (673-2600), has elevated the Italian mom-and-pop store into a gastronomic institution. Here you will find everything from fresh white truffles from Piemonte to the finest Tuscan olive oil to sausages, prosciutto hams and cheeses from all parts of Italy. Its mail-order service ships all over the world. There are three excellent sources for fresh, made-on-the-premises Italian pasta that are deserving of more than passing notice: Bruno the King of Ravioli, 653 Ninth Avenue at 45th Street (246-8456), the Piemonte Homemade Ravioli Company, 190 Grand Street (226-0475), and Raffetto's, 144 West Houston Street (777-1261). All three make a variety of flat and stuffed pastas.\nJEWISH Along East Houston Street there are a few historic establishments that recall the days when Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe made the Lower East Side such a vital part of the city. At Yonah Schimmel's Knishery, 137 East Houston near First Avenue (477-2858), the knishes are made on the premises and filled with kasha, mashed potato, mashed sweet potato, spinach or sour cabbage. Also available is a smooth and refreshing cold borscht and some of the finest yogurt I've had, sour and tangy, served in a drinking glass with a crust of cream on top. At 179 East Houston Street, Russ & Daughters (475-4880) has fresh Malossol caviar and a variety of smoked and salted fish: smoked salmon, including the esteemed, sweet-smoked Gaspe; lox, or salted salmon, an acquired taste; smoked whitefish and lake sturgeon; schmaltz or salted herring; pickled herring and Swedish pickled herring, more spicy and pungent in flavor, dark, salty matjes herring and my own favorite, tender sweet-sour pickled herring filets bathed in thick sour cream. Russ & Daughters has other products of high quality - cheeses, roasted and salted nuts, an array of dried and candied fruits -but one goes there for the fish. The specialties at Ben's Cheese Shop, 181 East Houston (254-8290), are farmer cheese, cottage cheese and cream cheese, all made daily on the premises, and a remarkable sweet butter from upstate New York that comes in a long rectangular log from which you may buy as much or as little as you want. Next door, and sharing the address, Moshe's Homemade Kosher Bakery (475-9624) makes flavorful onion rye and a pumpernickel that is the real thing - dark, sour and chewy. God made bread and butter to go together, which is why these two shops are side by side.\nPOLISH At Eagle Provisions, 628 Fifth Avenue, between 17th and 18th Streets in Brooklyn (718 499-0026), Szecepan and John Zawisny, a father-son team, prepare and smoke daily an enormous gamut of Polish sausages and pork products, including kielbasa, rouladen (pork tenderloin wrapped with bacon), liverwurst, ham, spareribs (traditional for Ukrainian Christmas, the Zawisnys say), headcheese and kieszka. The market, reached from the Prospect Avenue stop on the RR or N train, also stocks the fragrant Polish dried mushrooms with which to make traditional Christmas Eve soup.\nRUSSIAN Along Brighton Beach Avenue in Brooklyn, in the lively community of Russian Jews called Little Odessa, there are several shops that specialize in smoked fish, Russian sausages, dark, yeasty Russian black bread and an assortment of pickles. M & I International, 249 Brighton Beach Avenue (718 648-8847), a store on two levels, has the largest assortment of these items, but Fish Town, at No. 414 (718 332-7445), has an impressive variety of smoked, dried and pickled fish and very good prices on Russian and Iranian caviar. SPANISH, MEXICAN, LATIN AMERICAN Casa Moneo, 210 West 14th Street (929-1644), has a wide choice of Spanish, Mexican and Latin American foods: manchego sheep's milk cheese from Spain; guava and quince paste; fresh and seasoned Spanish sausages as well as canned chorizo and morcilla (blood sausage); cider from northwestern Asturias, Spanish beer, and a mix to make the Spanish almond-flavored drink called horchata. All the ingredients necessary for Mexican cooking are available: tortillas, tortilla flour (both blue and yellow cornmeal), dried and fresh red and green chilis in all degrees of hotness, jack cheese, parched hominy for posole, fresh tomatillos (the little husked fruits used to make green salsas), nopatillos (cactus pads), dark Mexican chocolate and thick honey, as well as frozen empanadas and other prepared dishes. The shop also has cones of dark brown cane sugar and dried potatoes from Peru, white and yellow parched hominy from Ecuador, and rose petals, linden flowers and licorice root among many herbal teas.\nTHAI The taste of sweet sauces and hot chilis combined with fragrant coriander and lemon grass attracted an eager following as Thais opened restaurants in recent years. The cuisine is similar to Chinese and many ingredients can be found in Chinese and other Asian stores, but it has its own, unmistakable flavor. For specialized foods, such as lemon grass, laos, hot nam prik sauce and coconut milk, try the hole-in-the-wall Thai Grocery, 81 Bayard Street (349-7662), or Wing Woh Lung, 50 Mott Street (962-3459), in Chinatown.\nVIETNAMESE With the growing Vietnamese population in New York, there are many more shops and restaurants specializing in Vietnamese food, which, while similar to Thai cuisine, uses a subtler blend of flavors and ingredients. The most important element is the magnificent fish sauce called nuoc mam, a protein-rich, pungent seasoning that is included, one way or another, in almost every Vietnamese dish. Most of the Vietnamese food shops are in Chinatown. Hoa Thanh Grocery Cong Ty, at 220 Canal Street (732-72810), has nuoc mam and a good selection of tuongs, or pastes (tamarind, chili, shrimp), and transparent rice wafers used to make cha gio, the Vietnamese version of eggroll."}, {"text": "U.N. FINDS WIDESPREAD INEQUALITY FOR WOMEN\n1985-06-23T05:00:00.000Z\nTwo United Nations studies on women have concluded that although women have made some gains in education, health, employment and politics in the last decade, equal rights for women are still a long way off.\n''The scales of world equality are out of balance,'' said a recent report on the State of the World's Women prepared for the United Nations Decade for Women, which draws to a close with a conference in Kenya next month.\n''The side marked 'woman,' '' the report said, ''is weighed down with responsibility, while the side marked 'man' rides high with power.\n''The results point, again and again, to the major underlying cause of women's inequality,'' it said. ''A woman's domestic role as wife and mother - which is vital to the well-being of society - is underpaid and undervalued.''\nYet, the report said, ''there are relatively few women anywhere in the world who can claim to be 'just a housewife.' ''\nStatistics on Jobs\nThirty-five percent of married European women hold jobs, for example, the report says. In Africa, women do 75 percent of the agricultural work, in addition to domestic chores of caring for children, fetching water and firewood, cooking and cleaning.\nIn Malawi, the report said, women do twice as much work as men on the staple crop, corn, in addition to equal amounts in the cotton fields and their domestic chores at home. A survey in Burkina Faso found families lost weight during the rainy season, not because there was no food available but because their long days in the fields left women too exhausted to cook.\nIn the developed countries, it is estimated that women spend 56 hours a week on domestic chores; in developing countries it can be more.\nAnother report showed that in Italy, 85 percent of married women who had children and full-time jobs were married to men who did no domestic work at all.\nThe United Nations report concluded that there had been ''no consistent increase'' of women's participation in politics in the past 10 years.\nSeats in Government\nIn the majority of European countries, women hold from 5 to 11 percent of the seats of government; a sampling of developing countries in various regions, including Venezuela, India and Kenya, showed women with 6 percent of places in government.\nWomen are still underrepresented in managerial positions, the report says. In Indonesia and Bangladesh, for example, only 1 percent of managers are women. In the United States, Norway and Australia, men outnumbered women as managers by 3 to 1, and women were five times as likely to be secretaries and clerks.\nBut, according to the report, there are signs that governments have begun to take women's contributions seriously. Ninety percent of all nations have official bodies dedicated to the advancement of women, the report said, half of them created since the beginning of the decade.\nA majority of countries have established constitutional and legal equality between women and men, and 65 nations have become a party to the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women.\nNinety countries now have equal-pay-for-work legislation, up from 28 countries 10 years ago. The wage gap is closing only slightly, the report says, with women still earning less than three-quarters of the wage of men doing similar work.\nThe education gap is closing more quickly. Women still make up 60 percent of the world's illiterate people, but the report describes an ''education avalanche'' that is reflected in the fact that 82 percent of boys and 71 percent of girls are in primary school."}, {"text": "VIEWS ON WOMEN AND THEIR DECADE; AT LEAST THE GOALS SEEM CLEARER\n1985-07-14T05:00:00.000Z\nMORE than 10,000 women met in Nairobi, Kenya, last week for an unofficial series of workshops that are overlapping an official conference beginning tomorrow to mark the end of the United Nations Decade for Women. Called Forum '85, the 1,000 workshops were focused on the themes of ''equality, development and peace.'' According to high-ranking United Nations officials, they were chosen in large part to satisfy the three factions into which the conference has divided: equality for the Western group, development for the third world and peace for the Eastern group. Most of the paragraphs on peace and disarmament in the official document of the conference to be discussed this week were Soviet-inspired. From the start, many of the workshops were marked by disputes between representatives of nations involved in disputes, such as Iraq and Iran. Elaine Sciolino, a New York Times reporter, interviewed several of the delegates about changes since they began working together 10 years ago and their expectations for the future. Excerpts follow.\nThe Law and Reality\nIt's all right to talk about job opportunities, but our priorities are different from the Western world. Our laws, on paper, are wonderful achievements, but the reality is different. Islam is being misinterpreted. Men put us on a pedestal and keep us at home, and we have convinced ourselves that we are not capable of responsibility. Throughout the Indian subcontinent, dowries are illegal, but there are dowry demands by husbands. And when they aren't met, the cruelty starts up, the beatings, the poisonings. Sometimes the newspapers report these deaths as suicides, but they are murders. We have taken some of these cases to court, but they have been rejected for lack of proof.\nFor us, wife-beating is such a part of life that women accept it without question. Sexual assault and rape is still something we don't talk about, and there is no such thing as marital rape since in the subcontinent, since a wife has to submit to her husband. In all of South Asia, the problem is how to enforce women's rights. We don't even know our rights. Sigma Huda A lawyer from Bangladesh and founder of the National Women's Lawyers Association The Pull of Tradition An incident like Bhopal makes headlines because a few thousand people died in a few days. But we have thousands of people dying in Africa every day because of the famine. Because we are agriculture-based and because women produce the food in this part of the world, the environment has to be the base of our development. We know that most of the developing countries have been crippled by debts, which are strangling us and pushing poor people in rural areas to produce cash crops. So we started the Green Belt Movement, a massive tree-planting and education movement for ordinary people.\nMost women who have come to Nairobi for the conference, especially those from the north, have never seen this low standard of living. This is such a good chance for them to visit the villages of Kenya and see what the third world looks like. They will go home wiser.\nAlmost everything boils down to poverty and ignorance. Meeting the basic needs of food, clothing and shelter is the first priority of African women. After that, it's changing traditions. Legally, a woman can own property, but traditions dictate that she is owned by her husband, so anything she owns belongs to him.\nThe decade has been an achievement; thousands of women have clearer goals. They're complaining less and talking more about strategies for the future. There is even a greater receptivity on the part of governments. But equality means nothing if what we are fighting to share is poverty and hardships. Wangari Maathai Head of the National Council of Women of Kenya, an umbrella group of women's organizations Phasing In Change Women are on everyone's agenda now. Every government, bar none, now understands that women are a different political constituency. Now it's up to women's organizations to make what governments have agreed upon happen. It's now the implementation phase. Women have 10 years of experience behind them. Before we acted like ladies. Now we're not as nice to each other as we used to be. We're also not talking about oppression and all the reasons why we can't do things.\nYou don't hear third world women saying so much anymore that women's issues can only be dealt with after other problems are solved. Ten years ago that was their theme. They've come to realize that their governments are not going to take care of them. Ten years ago many countries would have refused to admit that female-headed households were a problem. We didn't have data on so many issues, just guesses. Now we have volumes of stuff.\nThe most important thing we can do now is to strengthen independent nongovernmental organizations. The third world needs them so badly because most of their countries are one-party governments. The people who will get a lot out of the workshops will be the ones who organize women's networks in their specialties. Arvonne S.

Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs"}, {"text": "EXOTIC VEGETARIAN DISCOVERY: THE CUISINE OF AN INDIAN STATE\n1985-08-21T05:00:00.000Z\nIT seems to be one of those unexplained quirks of history and society. Though a large percentage of Indians living in New York and elsewhere in the United States migrated from the state of Gujarat, and though many of us are interested in preparing vegetable dishes as part of a healthy diet, the incredibly tasty vegetarian cuisine of India's Gujarat region is unfamiliar to most Americans.\nI realized this when, returning by plane from a trip to that part of the world, I sat next to an Indian gentleman who told me that Gujarati cooking is ''among the most interesting in the nation.'' Oddly enough, he continued, ''you can't find a decent Gujarati restaurant in New York.''\nThe soil of Gujarat, which is in the western part of the country, is very rich; so, too, are the varieties of vegetables, legumes and grains cultivated in the state. This abundance suits the people well. Most are Hindus or Jains: the first do not eat beef, because they consider the cow sacred, and often avoid other meat also; the second are strict vegetarians.\nGeography and religion have conspired in a way, then, to produce a vegetarian cuisine of surprising range and quality - one whose infinite variety of flavors is achieved through the artful combination of ingredients and juggling of spices.\nThe Gujarati have carried their culinary talents to such far-flung places as East Africa, Britain, Canada and the United States.\nWhen I returned to New York, I set out to find Gujarati cooks. I was rewarded when I met a United Nations official, Bhaichand Patel - a native of Fiji and a food enthusiast whose parents were Gujarati.\nMr. Patel's wife, Vibhuti, is a freelance writer who contributes to publications in the United States and India. She is also one of a group of Gujarati women, including Chitra Mehta, a travel agent, and Sudha Doshi, a homemaker, who gather periodically to prepare their native cuisine.These women are not ''cookbook cooks,'' whose knowledge of food came from formal classes and reading. Rather, they were taught by mothers, friends, servants and assorted relatives. The home kitchen was their classroom.\nI asked to join them in the kitchen, preparing one such meal. The arrangements were not difficult; they take enormous pride in the food of their homeland and in their own cooking skills.\nThe menu we had agreed upon consisted of a sour cream and yogurt confection, lightly sweetened and flavored, and then colored with saffron; a tasty cucumber and chickpea dish called katchumbar, made with lime juice and spices; a delectable course of vegetables stuffed with spices; a casserole of moong dal, which are yellow split mung beans, and spices; and a smooth and creamy yogurt-based soup, which also can be used as a sauce over rice.\nThe cooking began, as I was told it must in Indian homes, with the opening of the metal spice box. Indeed, Mrs. Mehta told me that she never travels without it. The box, she said, contains ground hot red pepper; whole chilies; whole cumin seeds; turmeric; whole fenugreek seeds, leguminous brownish-yellow beans with a pronounced aroma and bitter taste, and asafetida, a combination of dried gum resins from certain plant roots that, when used in very small amounts - it is very powerful, so no more than a pinch is needed - imparts a subtle oniony aroma to food.\n''In all of India,'' Mrs. Patel said, ''one of the principal flavorings is garam masala, a special blend of flavors, which is sold commercially, but no respectable home cook would dare buy it. You always prepare it at home by grinding and blending your own spices.''\nSerious cooks apparently feel that the flavors of a garam masala are too evanescent, that they dissipate too quickly, for this combination of roasted spices to be stored over long periods. Mrs. Patel, for example, said she prepares a batch of garam masala twice a month, on average; her mother-in-law makes it daily, and never more than one cupful at a time.\nThere is no standard garam masala; the spices used and their amounts vary from cook to cook, and sometimes from dish to dish. Mrs. Patel said she sometimes has two or three versions on her shelf. The basis of most garam masala, however, is the same - a combination of a lot of whole coriander and smaller amounts of whole cumin, cloves, black pepper and cinnamon, which are roasted together and ground in a coffee or spice mill.\nMrs. Patel noted that the chief ingredients for a Gujarati meal, besides the spices, are lentils and dairy products. There is extensive use of yogurt, sour cream and ghee, a clarified butter that keeps for several weeks at the least, and generally longer.\nGhee is not like the clarified butter familiar to American cooks, which is made by melting fresh butter, then straining the clear butter from the milk residue that has settled at the bottom of the saucepan. Ghee is made by melting fresh butter and then allowing it to simmer on a very low flame while the moisture in the milk solids evaporates. After a time, the butterfat starts turning brown and settling to the bottom of the saucepan, leaving clear liquid - the ghee - on top.\nAccording to these cooks, making ghee is laborious; the ghee available in stores is of high quality, so they recommended buying it.\nAcknowledging the absence of Gujarati restaurants in New York and Americans' ignorance of this cuisine, Mrs. Patel noted: ''Basically, Gujarati are not restaurant owners. They are doctors, lawyers, hotel and motel owners.''\nWhat kinds of food, then, are we getting in Indian restaurants? Generally, it is north Indian. Gujarati cooking, Mrs. Patel said, is ''less spicy than the food of south India and less rich than that of north India.''\n''People who are not familiar with our foods think we lead a fairly deprived existence, but it isn't true,'' Mrs. Doshi told me as she prepared the yogurt soup.\nIn Gujarat, bread is always served with the first part of the meal and rice at the end, rather than with other courses. Indeed, bread is the staple, while lentil purees and vegetables prepared in sesame oil are among the most common dishes served in a Gujarati home, as in the meal we were preparing. A special feature of Gujarati food is that a sweet dish, such as srikhand or a sweetened yogurt mixture in which the liquid has been drained off, is served at the start of the meal.\nCustomarily, Gujarati food is served in a thali, a meal tray with small metal bowls. Each bowl contains an element of the meal.\nI asked if wines or other alcoholic drinks are served with Gujarati meals. According to Mrs. Doshi, they are not. ''We do not drink with meals,'' she said. ''The drinks that do appear are mostly dairy products - milk or buttermilk or drinks made with yogurt; things that are considered cooling to the palate.''There is no religious prohibition against serving alcohol; rather, it is tradition that it not be served in the home. Some Gujarati serve it socially nowadays, but generally before meals.

But some optimistic scientists believe that science may ultimately be able to do for Africa what it has already helped to accomplish in much of Asia -eliminating chronic food shortages and periodic, seemingly inevitable, famines.\n''The job is going to take some time,'' said Nyle C. Brady, assistant administrator for science and technology in the Agency for International Development.\n''But you just know it's going to unfold. I don't think there's any question that the potential is there.''\nDr. Brady may be in a good position to know. He once headed the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines, a laboratory that is credited with a major role in developing high-yielding varieties of rice that helped bring a ''Green Revolution'' to previously food-short regions of Asia.\nBut similar promises about improving African agriculture have been made by overly optimistic scientists for decades with little to show for it so far, said Carl K. Eicher, professor of agricultural economics at Michigan State University, who has performed perhaps the most extensive recent reviews of agricultural technologies in sub-Saharan Africa. ''Some scientists have consistently promised too glowing a prospect,'' Dr. Eicher said in a telephone interview. ''There has been a gap between expectations and performance, and there's a credibility problem now. Africa has brought many scientists to their knees on this question.''\nThe lack of improved crop varieties capable of producing high yields in the harsh and variable climatic conditions in Africa is one of the contributing factors to the famine now coursing through the continent. Africa is the only continent to suffer a decline in per capita food production in recent decades, caused partly by rapid population growth that has outstripped food supplies, and partly by lagging agricultural productivity. Traditional agriculture in the region of Africa below the Sahara uses very few fertilizers, pesticides, improved seeds or machines, and produces the lowest yield per acre and per person of any major region. When bad weather strikes, as in the current prolonged drought, there is little resilience.\nDire Problems Persist Despite Aid\nThe latest international statistics show that the continent is still in dire straits despite massive international food aid and the return of needed rains to some areas. A report issued last month by the United Nations Office for Emergency Operations in Africa said that ''the situation in the continent's most severely affected nations is continuing to deteriorate,'' particularly in the Sudan, but also in the Sahelian belt directly south of the Sahara, and in Mozambique and Botswana in the south, where ''the number of those in need of urgent food aid continues to rise.''\nThe prospects for improvement in agricultural productivity in Africa are uncertain. Many scientists draw hope from the fact that agricultural research has succeeded in recent decades in increasing crop yields in both Asia and Latin America. The achievements in some countries once viewed as hopeless have been prodigious. India, which relied heavily on imported food for survival in the 1960's, is now largely self-sufficient in cereal production. Bangladesh, widely described as a basket-case two decades ago, is approaching self-sufficiency. China, which suffered a devastating famine between 1958 and 1961, is today exporting food, an achievement that Chinese officials attribute partly to improved crop varieties and partly to governmental policies designed to encourage better farming.\n''And now, coming along the pike, are similar developments that are taking place with other crops'' and other areas of the world, says Dr. Brady, of A.I.D.\nEnormous Difficulties Remain\nBut efforts to produce a Green Revolution in Africa face enormous difficulties that appear more daunting than the task in Asia and Latin America. Africa has a harsher climate, its land is more depleted from erosion and overuse, and its countries are generally poorer economically. It has far fewer trained scientists and functioning research institutions than, for example, India or China, and its inexperienced national governments have thus far been unwilling or unable to adopt policies that favor agricultural development as opposed to urban development. Few countries even have adequate transportation systems to move farm products to market or food to needy areas.\nMoreover, conditions in Africa are so different from those in Asia or Latin America, where the Green Revolution had its early successes, that no easy transfer of grain varieties has been possible. Twenty years ago, Dr. Eicher said, international experts were optimistic that they could quickly transfer Green Revolution technology to Africa, but the results were largely disappointing as the crops ran up against new diseases, soils and weather conditions.\n''Coming up with a Green Revolution in Africa is going to be a much tougher job than it was in India or Mexico,'' said Glen Vollmar, associate dean for international programs at the University of Nebraska and director of an international program, financed by A.I.D., to develop new varieties of two staple grain crops in Africa, sorghum and millet.\nA Whiff of Progress\nThe latest research gains, though modest, provide a whiff of progress after decades of failure to improve crop yields in Africa.\nPerhaps the most recent research success is a new high-yielding, drought-resistant strain of sorghum that has been developed in the Sudan, one of the countries most severely affected by the African drought. ''That's a breakthrough that is right before us,'' said Dr. Brady. ''It's so new that they're right now trying to get it into the hands of farmers.''\nDr. Woods Thomas, director of international programs at Purdue University, said that several new hybrid sorghum strains have been developed by scientists working in the Sudan over the past six years. He said that one strain looked ''very, very promising'' in test plantings last year; its seed is now being multiplied for distribution to farmers. ''The field tests suggest probably a twofold increase in yield,'' he said. ''That's a highly significant thing.'' The other new strains are still under study, he said.\nSimilar gains with millet are further off. ''Very little work has been done with millet over the years,'' said William D. Stegmeier, a research agronomist at Kansas State University, one of the leading centers of millet research in this country. ''I suspect part of the reason is that it's a crop consumed by the poorest people in the poorest areas of the world. But in the last few years it's been receiving a lot more attention, especially in Africa.''\nDr. Stegmeier said new varieties of millet are being grown on a small scale in the Sudan, including one variety that matures more quickly than traditional varieties, making it potentially useful when the rainy season is very short. ''The crop has a lot of potential,'' he said. ''Millets will play an important role but they're quite a bit behind the sorghums.''\nMaize Crop Is Dramatic Success\nThe most dramatic practical success so far, according to Dr. Brady, is the recent widespread adoption in Zimbabwe of new high-yielding strains of maize - as corn is generally called outside the United States - that were developed years ago by international and government research stations. This year's maize crop in Zimbabwe far exceeded advance expectations, Dr. Brady said, largely because small farmers used the new strains more widely than anyone predicted. ''The notion that poor people won't accept new technology is hogwash,'' he said.\nOther recent research advances, according to Dr. Brady, include a disease-resistant variety of the root crop cassava, with three times the yield of native strains, that has been developed at an international institute in Nigeria, where cassava is a staple food; new cowpea varieties, with short growing seasons, drought tolerance and resistance to disease; and new breeding experiments to protect cattle from the sleeping sickness that prevents them from foraging in vast areas of Africa. In addition, other scientists say, new potato varieties have been found to yield well in Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya and Rwanda.\nMany of the advances have been achieved through an international organization known as the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research, which is managed by the World Bank. The organization has four of its 13 research centers in Africa and close to 40 percent of its 700 scientists working on Africa-related issues.\nBut all these advances are relatively modest and of uncertain payoff when viewed against the enormous needs of Africa. Dr. Eicher, the Michigan State economist, noted that the maize that produced record crops in Zimbabwe this year took decades to develop. In parts of eastern and southern Africa, he said, maize technology has been developed but is being held back by lack of credit and delivery systems.\nIn West Africa the prognosis is even more discouraging, he added. Although the French initiated research on millet and sorghum in West Africa more than 50 years ago, he said, ''there is still no breakthrough.'' Moreover, neither wheat nor rice strains imported from the Green Revolution have adapted very well to Africa. Although some 5,000 imported varieties of rice have been tested over the past 15 years, Dr. Eicher said, only two produced yeilds as high as the best local varieties. ''Again, the outlook is bleak,'' he said. ''There really is a lot to be done yet,'' said G. Edward Schuh, director of the agriculture department at the World Bank. ''There are parts of Africa where we simply don't know how to sustain yields unless we keep the land idle for a while and let it rest. We simply don't know how to do it if we crop on a continuous basis, even with fertilizers imported from the West.''\n''We don't understand the soils of Africa very well,'' he continued, or the complex of interactions among soil, rainfall, climate, and temperature. ''It's a neglected area where not enough work has been done,'' he said. ''The picture is not all bleak, but it's clear there is a long way to go.''\nMore Research Is Needed\nArthur Onken, professor of soil chemistry at Texas A & M University in Lubbock, warned that more research is needed on African soils before any widespread changes in customary agricultural practices are made. Dr. Onken noted that crop yields in other areas of the world have been increased greatly through the use of chemical fertilizers and irrigation. But research in Mali and Niger suggests, he said, that soils in those semiarid areas ''may be fragile to chemicals.'' Dr. Onken said his research group, with the help of financing from A.I.D., is looking at ways to make the African soils more permeable to water and is investigating how the addition of water and fertilizer would affect crop yields. He hopes to have ''some indication about what to do'' in the next three to five years. ''We need to move cautiously,'' he said.\nThe chief ingredient needed in Africa, many experts agree, is a greater commitment by both the Africans themselves and by international donors to improving agricultural productivity. ''In the long run, the African problem is solvable,'' Jean Mayer, president of Tufts University and one of the nation's leading experts on hunger, wrote earlier this year. ''Agricultural self-sufficiency is possible by the end of the century, but not without a major commitment by the African nations and the developed countries, the United States in particular.''"}, {"text": "AGE HASN'T COOLED THE FIRE INSIDE ALI\n1985-04-28T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE SPRAWLING, three-story house was quiet, except for the tinny too-wa, too-wee of birds in a small aviary next to the office room on the first floor. It was early on a recent morning and the cool, shadowed office was dimly lit by two antique candelabras which had a few of their small bulbs burned out. An antique lamp was also lit and with its slightly crooked shade peered over the large black mahogany desk scattered with letters and an Islamic prayer book. Nearby were several open boxes stuffed with mail.\nBehind the desk, three large windows opened onto a back yard, half in sunlight, with cypress trees and pruned bushes and a swimming pool. Along another wall in the office, a pair of black men's shoes stood by themselves in the middle of a brown-suede couch. In another corner, a television set, with another on top of it, rested on the Oriental rug that covered most of the floor of the room. On the wall facing the desk was a marble fireplace without a fire.\nSuddenly, a torch appeared in the doorway. The fire, burning at the end of a rolled-up newspaper, was followed by a large man in black-stockinged feet who trotted into the room. ''Hoo, hoo,'' he said, as the flame burned closer to his hand, and he tossed the torch into the fireplace. Quickly, the logs in the fireplace crackled with the flame, and Muhammad Ali, the torchbearer, watched them burn. Then he sat down in an armchair in front of his desk and in a moment closed his eyes.\nHe said something, indistinct, in a gravelly mumble, and the visitor, in a chair facing him, asked Ali if he would repeat it.\n''Tired,'' he said, with a little more effort, his eyes still closed. It was 8 o'clock in the morning and Ali had been up since 5:30 saying his daily prayers.\nHe stretched his legs. He wore a light blue shirt, unbuttoned at the cuffs, which was not tucked into his dark blue slacks. At 43, Ali's face is rounder and his body is thicker than when he first won the world heavyweight championship by knocking out Sonny Liston in Miami in February 1964. The 6-foot-3-inch Ali weighed 215 then and is now about 240 pounds.\nIn the ensuing years, he would weigh as much as 230 in the ring as he lost and regained the title two more times - an unprecedented feat in the heavyweight division. Ali, who was stopped in a one-sided bout by Larry Holmes while attempting to win the title yet a fourth time, retired five years ago, but he is hardly forgotten.\nA few days before, he had been at ringside at the Hagler-Hearns middleweight title fight in Las Vegas, Nev. Numerous ex-champions were introduced before the bout. Ali was saved for last.\nHe was asked now how he felt about that moment. He said nothing, and it appeared he was sleeping. Then: ''A-li, A-li, A-li,'' he said, opening his eyes and mimicking the chant that arose among the 16,000 fans when the ring announcer introduced him.\n''I had to go like this,'' he said softly, raising his right index finger to his lips, ''to calm the people down.\n''A lot of fighters, when they quit no one ever hears of them again. But I've gotten bigger since I quit boxin'. Look at this,'' he said, nodding to a box in the corner, ''people from all over the world writin' me. Thirty-one boxes full of fan mail in four years.''\nOne was from Bangladesh, sent to ''Loos Anjeles,'' and calling Ali ''my unknown Uncle.'' Another from West Germany asked ''Mr. Ali'' for his autograph. A third was from Drakefield Road in London and sent to the New York Presbyterian Hospital, where Ali had gone late last summer for a checkup. He has been diagnosed as having Parkinson's Syndrome, a nerve disorder.\nAli asked the visitor to open the letter and read it aloud.\n''I am very sorry to know of your temporary problem,'' wrote the Briton, ''and wish you most sincerely a rapid recovery. Many of my friends who are fans of yours are thinking the same, that you will in a very short time be back to your old poetic self and come and see us in dear old London. . . .''\nDo you still write poetry? the visitor asked Ali.\n''No,'' he said, ''no more. That was in a different time. Eighteen times callin' the round. 'That's no jive, Cooper will fall in five.' 'Moore in four.' ''\nThe visitor recalled a personal favorite, when Ali predicted how his first fight with Liston would go. it turned out that Liston didn't answer the bell for the seventh round. Did Ali remember the poem?\n''Mmmmm,'' he said. It wasn't sure what he meant by that.\nBut he began, his voice still very low:\n''Ali comes out to meet Liston, And then Liston starts to retreat.\n''If he goes back any farther, he'll wind up in a ringside seat.''\nHe paused thoughtfully, then continued.\n''And Liston keeps backin' but there's not enough room, ''It's a matter of time - There! Ali lowers the boom.\n''Ali lands with a right - what a beautiful swing!\n''The punch knocks Liston right out of the ring. . . .''\nJust then the phone rang. ''My phone's ringin,' '' he said. ''Hold on.'' He reached over to his desk. ''Yeah, naw, naw,'' he said sleepily into the phone. ''I wouldn't try that for no $5,000, you crazy?'' He noded. ''Check ya later.'' And hung up. ''Where was I?''\nHe was reminded that he had just knocked Liston out of the ring.\n''Who woulda thought,'' he continued, ''when they came to the fight, ''That they'd witness the launchin' of a hu-man satellite.\n''Yes, yes, the crowd did not dream when they laid down their money, ''That they would see a total eclipse of the Sonny.''\nAli's voice was fading again. ''I wrote that 22 years ago,'' he said, his words getting lost in a throat. ''That was a long time.'' He is taking voice lessons from Gary Catona, who had come into the room during the recital of the old limerick. Catona is a voice and singing teacher who three weeks ago had come to Los Angeles from Austin, Tex., to try to help Ali speak more clearly.\nAli began to speak more slowly and less distinctly over the last several years. There was much speculation about him suffering a variety of illnesses. During his hospital visit in New York last September, doctors determined that he had Parkinson's Syndrome.\nCatona believes that the only problem with Ali's voice is that his vocal muscles are weak, that they lack resonance.\nAli was asked what was wrong with his voice. ''I dunno,'' he said, ''somethin'.'' ''Muhammad never really had strong vocal muscles,'' said Catona. ''He used to scream out his words. His normal speech was never a normal speech.''\nAli and his voice teacher schedule a one-hour lesson every day, but Ali travels a lot and they don't always connect. ''But he's good when we do it,'' said Catona. ''It's like building body muscles, you've got to work at it. He sings the sounds of the scales. 'Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!' '' Catona sang, his voice rising at each 'Ah!'\nCatona and Ali had already had the session at the piano in the living room, and beyond this Ali was asked what he's been doing with himself lately.\n''People are interested in you,'' he was told. ''You're one of the most popular figures. . . .'' ''Popular niggers?'' he interrupted. ''Figures,'' the visitor repeated.\nAli looked at him playfully out of the corner of his eye.\n''What am I doin' now, oh, I'm so busy,'' he said, growing serious now. ''I'm busy every day. I've got all this mail to answer - they're startin' fan clubs for me all over the world, in Asia, in Europe, in Ireland, in China, in Paris. But my mission is to establish Islamic evangelists, and to tour the world spreadin' Islam.''\nHe converted from Christianity to the Islamic faith 21 years ago, changing his name, as the world knows, from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali.\nOn the shelf above the fireplace stood a Sports Illustrated cover from May, 5, 1969, laminated on a wooden plaque. The cover showed the young boxer wearing a crown, with the caption, ''Ali-Clay - The Once - and Future? - King.''\nWhat's the difference between Cassius Clay and Muhammad Ali? he was asked.\n''As much difference as night and day,'' he said. ''Cassius Clay was popular in America and Europe. Muhammad Ali has a billion more fans all over the world. Cassius Clay had no knowledge of his self. He thought Clay was his name, but found out it was a slave name. Clay means 'dirt, with no ingredients.' Cassius - I don't know what that means. But Ali means 'The most high,' and Muhammad means 'worthy of praise and praiseworthy.'\n''Cassius Clay had Caucasian images of God on his wall. Muhammad Ali was taught to believe that there should be no image of God. No color. That's a big difference.''\nHe rose and got a large briefcase from under his desk. He withdrew several religious pamphlets with pictures of Jesus Christ. All but one was white. Then he took out a Bible and opened it to Exodus 20:4, and asked the visitor to read it. ''Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above. . . .''\n''Ooohh,'' said Ali. ''Powerful, isn't it. But what are all these. Man, you thought boxin' was powerful. Boxin's little. These pictures teach supremacy. The Bible says there should be no pictures of God, no images, he should be no color. But you see that God is white. Tarzan, King of the Jungle, was a white man. Angel's food cake is white, devil's-food cake is black. Man, ain't that powerful? ''Cassius Clay would not have the nerve to talk like this - he'd be afraid of what people might say or think. Ali is fearless, he's hopin', prayin' that you print this. Cassius Clay would not have the courage to refuse to be drafted for the Vietnam war. But Muhammad Ali gave up his title, and maybe he would have to go to jail for five years.''\nHe rose again and this time brought back a plastic box, flipped up the latches, and opened the lid. It was a box of magic paraphernalia.\nHe took two red foam rubber balls and made them become four right before the visitor's eyes, then turned them into a box of matches, then made them disappear altogether. His eyes widened in mock shock. He still has the fastest hands of any heavyweight in history. It was a very good trick. How did he do it? ''It's against the law for magicians to tell their tricks,'' he said. ''It's a tricky world,'' he said. He next transformed three small unstretchable ropes of varying sizes into the same size.\nHe made a handkerchief disappear, but, on the second showing, he was too obvious about stuffing it into a fake thumb.\n''You should only show that trick once,'' he said, a little embarrassed.\nHe redeemed his virtuosity by putting four quarters into the visitor's hand, snapping his fingers, and ordering the quarters to become two dimes and two pennies. The quarters obeyed. He snapped his fingers again and the quarters returned; the pennies and dimes vanished.\n''It's magic for kids,'' he said. ''It's my hobby. See how easy they can be deceived? But these aren't childish things. They make you think, don't they?''\nIt was mentioned that perhaps Ali's best magic trick was transforming the small house he lived in as a boy in Louisville into this 22-room house with expensive antique furniture. He made more than $60 million in ring earnings and endorsements. ''But the Government took 70 percent,'' he said. He says he is financially secure. He doesn't do commercials, for example, because, he said, ''I don't need the money.''\nHe lives here in Wilshire with his two children by Veronica Ali, 8-year-old Hana and 6-year-old Laila. They employ a live-in housekeeper. His six other children live with his two former wives.\n''My wife likes antiques,'' he said, walking into the living room. He pointed to a tall clock against the wall. ''It's 150 years old,'' he said.\nGary Catona now took his leave, and arranged for a session the following morning. Ali led his visitor for a tour of the house. ''I'm not braggin','' he said, ''just showin'. I don't like to talk about what I have, because there's so many people hungry, homeless, no food, starvin', sleepin' on the streets.''\nIn the dining room, is a long dark table with 12 tall, carved chairs. On the second floor are the bedrooms. In the kids' rooms, toys and stuffed animals tumbled across the floor. There's an Oriental sitting room, and guest room.\nThe phone rang. ''City morgue,'' he answered. He spoke briefly and hung up.\nThey ascended the carpeted staircase to the third floor. On a wall are a pair of red boxing gloves encased in glass. One glove is signed, ''To the champion of champions - Sylvester Stallone.'' On an adjoining wall is a robe with multi-colored sequins that bears the inscription, ''The People's Choice.'' In the corner of the case was a photograph of a man with his arm around Ali. It is Elvis Presley, who gave Ali the robe.\nIn the adjoining room is a large pool table with a zebra skin lying over it. Trophies and plaques and photographs line the wall and cover the floor.\nHe was asked about recent efforts to ban boxing.\n''Too many blacks are doin' well in it, so white people want to ban it,'' he said. ''But how do I live here without boxin'? How would I ever be able to pay for all this? Look at Hearns and Hagler. Two poor black boys, but now they help their mother and father and sisters and brothers. It's from boxin'.\n''There's more deaths in football than boxin'. Nobody wants to ban football. You see car races. 'Whoom, whoom.' Cars hit the wall, burn up. Motor boats hit a bump. Bam! Don't ban that, do they?''\nGoing back down the stairs, the visitor is met by a nearly life-size painting of Ali in the ring wearing white boxing trunks. He is on his toes and his arms are raised in triumph. The signature in the corner of it reads, ''LeRoy Neiman, '71.''\nDid Ali miss fighting. ''When the fight's over,'' he said, ''you don't talk about it anymore.''\nThe visitor asked about his health. ''I don't feel sick,'' Ali said. ''But I'm always tired.''\nHow did he feel now? ''Tired,'' he said, ''tired.''\nA doctor friend, Martin Ecker of Presbyterian Hospital, has said that if Ali takes his prescribed medication four times a day - the medication is L-Dopa, which in effect peps up the nervous system (the disease does not affect the brain) - then Ali's condition would be improved substantially. The medication does not cure the disease, but it increases alertness.\nAli is inconsistent in taking the medication. He believes it doesn't matter if he takes the medication, because he is in the hands of Allah, and that his fate is sealed. Days go by when he doesn't take the medicine. But when friends urge him to, or when he is going to make a public appearance, then he is more inclined to take his dosage.\nDid he feel that after 25 years of amateur and professional fights, of countless hours of sparring, that he had taken too many punches?\nHe stopped on the second-floor landing. He rubbed his face with his hands. ''Uh uh,'' he said, softly. ''Look how smooth. I very rarely got hit.''\nAs the visitor turned from Ali and opened the door to go, he heard an odd cricket sound behind his ear.\nThe champ smiled kindly but coyly. There was either a cricket in the house or something that sounded like a cricket in his hand.\nWalking to his car in this quiet, elegant neighborhood, and then driving out past the security guard at the gate, the visitor realized he would not plumb the mystery of the cricket sound in Muhammad Ali's house. It's a tricky world, he recalled, and he would leave it at that."}, {"text": "THE FAMINE WORKERS\n1985-12-01T05:00:00.000Z\nWHEN I LAST saw Hamid Bahamid, he was 4 years old and weighed 40 pounds. He was born in the Eritrean mountains across the border in Ethiopia; he will probably die in a hot tent in a refugee camp in the featureless desert of eastern Sudan.\nHis skin was taut across the sharp bones of his skull, his lips pulled back against his teeth, his eyes bulging. The rigid expression of his face, both frightened and frightening, suggested a ritual mask.\nLying on his back, each curved rib, each fragile bone standing out, he seemed impervious to the swarm of black flies that settled on him.\n''When it gets to this point, you can bet your money they won't last,'' said Shirley Cantrel, a registered nurse from Texas. She paused for a moment, perhaps considering how that sounds. ''Sometimes they do come out of it.''\nShe looked down at Hamid and stroked his face with her fingers. Her eyes grew damp. ''They always say you get used to it,'' she said angrily. ''But uh-uh. You don't get used to it. No.'' ABOUT A YEAR AGO, THE WESTERN world became abruptly aware of the hunger that had closed in on Ethiopia, the Sudan, Chad, Mozambique and other parts of Africa. Since then an unprecedented outpouring of food, money, sympathy and publicity has been directed toward the victims. Yet little attention has been paid to the thousands of men and women who distribute the food, administer the medicines, devise and implement the projects aimed at helping much of Africa lift itself from the quicksand of poverty, illness and starvation into which it has been rapidly sinking.\nI had been in contact with such people ever since I was first assigned to Africa in 1983. They were often good sources: more knowledgeable about what was going on at the grass-roots level than most diplomats, more honest than many African government officials and less afraid to speak their minds than the ordinary people in most countries on the continent. Over the last year, they also became for me guides through the nightmarish labyrinth of what some of them have called Africa's holocaust.\nThey are a diverse group -from soft-core Marxists to evangelical Christians to hard-nosed neo-conservatives to opportunistic bureaucrats. They include adminis-trators, economists, doctors, nutritionists, nurses, accountants, logisticians, warehouse and port managers, agronomists, foresters, mechanics and secretaries. Collectively, they go by various nicknames: ''soldiers of misfortune,'' ''masters of disasters,'' ''relief chiefs,'' ''mercy-naries,'' ''famine legionnaires'' and, simply, ''the faminists.''\nTheir spokesmen and fund-raisers generally project an attitude of determined optimism, intended to suggest that if only they can collect enough money and good will, Africa's most serious problems will be solved. Privately, an overwhelming number of relief and development workers now share two convictions: First, despite all the publicity -and to an extent because of it - the public still does not understand the causes of the famine. Second, the current rescue efforts are not likely to succeed in stopping the spread of hunger and poverty anytime soon.\n''I'm afraid we have to assume that from now on we'll need to intervene massively in Africa every few years to fight disasters,'' says Andrew Timpson, regional director for East Africa of Britain's Save the Children Fund. ''And we also have to assume that many of these countries will become wards of the donor community, international welfare cases, if you like, for a long, long time to come.''\nMany relief and development workers have also begun to express an ambivalence about their role. Although they are bringing life and hope to many, on a historical level their growing presence represents the first time since the colonial era that foreigners are taking responsibility for millions of African lives.\n''We bring our tools, our values, our ways of doing things,'' says Egil Hagen, an emergency coordinator for UNICEF. ''We are the new colonialists. But what's the alternative?''\nThe alternative has become unthinkable. Years ago, mothers would tell their children to finish dinner because ''people are starv-ing'' in China and India and think little more about it. The starving infants of Ethiopia and the Sudan, however, can be seen dying on the evening news. As Vietnam, the first fully televised international conflict, brought the war home to the United States, so the current famine may have brought home to the nations of the West the stark reality of contemporary African deprivation. ONE RELIEF WORKER I MET, A NUN, has been witness to that deprivation in southern Ethiopia for the last dozen years. She recalls the events that precipitated mass starvation.\n''Rainfall was part of it, of course,'' she says. ''Either there wasn't enough, or it came at the wrong time. But that wasn't all. Long before that, the Government was putting so many taxes on the farmers. It just made them poorer and poorer.\n''And then, a few years ago, some people from the Ministry of Agriculture showed up and ordered that all the false banana trees be cut down,'' she says, referring to a common tropical African plant that resembles a banana tree but gives no fruit. ''They said there were other, better crops that could be planted on the land instead.\n''Well, what these people didn't realize is that the root of the false banana is what peasants had always lived on in times of famine. It's sort of their own emergency relief food. Without it, thousands just starved to death.''\nPoverty and hunger are not unique to Africa, but nowhere else in the world are farmers producing less food per person than they did 20 years ago. Periodic droughts have contributed to the hunger, but to a lesser extent than most people in the West have been led to believe. At least as important and far less frequently depicted on Western television screens are the internal wars in Ethiopia, the Sudan, Chad, Mozambique, Angola - all countries suffering serious, widespread famine. Ethiopia, where starvation has been most severe, has been drained of human, financial and agricultural resources by a quarter-century-long civil war with separatist rebels in the Red Sea region of Eritrea. Ethiopia, classified as the poorest country in the world, has the largest army in sub-Saharan Africa.\nAfrica's birthrate, the highest of any continent's, is also accelerating the spread of poverty and hunger. The point is not that Africa hasn't room for more people; rather, its economic growth has not been able to keep pace. Rapid population expansion has also meant that ancient African farming methods, which were ecologically sound when habitation was sparse, have now overburdened the land, exhausting nutrients, stripping away protective vegetation and encouraging soil erosion.\nAlthough many in the West strongly advocate birth control as the solution, most relief workers say that the logistics of disseminating contraceptive information and devices in rural Africa are dizzying. And few African governments cooperate with family-planning programs.\nAs damaging as any of this are the policies of most African governments toward their rural majorities -roughly three-quarters of their popu-lations. This group has been squeezed in the vise of state marketing boards, which purchase farm products at low, fixed prices. The difference between the government's purchase price and its selling price often represents its main source of income, along with foreign aid. In many cases, that money is used to equip armies, construct office buildings, conference centers and all manner of prestigious projects and pay the salaries of civil servants and employees of inefficient government-owned industries.\n''The irony is that the people who produce the food are the ones who are starving while those in the cities still have food to eat,'' says Richard Copeland of the British relief agency Oxfam.\nDuring the famine, many farmers in some areas displayed an ability to take care of themselves that belies their popular image as helpless, passive victims of nature. When delivery of American grain was delayed in the remote and arid reaches of western Sudan last summer, thousands of farmers and herders confounded foreign experts' predictions, surviving on such traditional ''famine foods'' as leaves, grasses, roots, insects and wild berries soaked and boiled to leach out the poisons.\n''In the village where I grew up,'' says Tswenopele Moreni, Botswana's deputy coordinator of rural development, ''each year every peasant would turn a portion of his harvest over to the chief. He'd put that in a big silo and, when bad times came, distribute it to those in need. It was sort of like an insurance policy.''\nElsewhere in Africa, farmers would keep their own caches of dried grain, enough to carry them through years of crop failures. ''The peasants have centuries of experience coping with hardship,'' says Abdul Mohammed, an Ethiopian expatriate doing relief work for the Sudan Council of Churches in Khartoum. ''People underestimate the peasants.''\nBut even the most resourceful African farmer can be thwarted by governments that prosecute as criminals those who ''hoard'' grain. Some farmers battle back in subtle ways that have sometimes added to the hunger. Earlier this year, I was traveling with a relief worker, an agronomist, through the steep misty mountains north of Addis Ababa, an area not particularly hard hit by drought. As we passed some fields of ripe teff, the coarse grain that is Ethiopia's staple food, he became agitated.\n''This all should have been harvested by now,'' he explained. ''If heavy rains come, it will rot.'' The farmers had refrained from cutting the teff because the official price was too low, he said. Instead, they were going into the fields at night to cut only as much as they could use themselves or sell on the black market.\nB EFORE THE FAMINE THIS year, the world did not look upon relief and development as a particularly romantic business. Attitudes changed quite suddenly after Mohamed Amin, a Kenyan-based photographer with more than 20 years' experience covering Africa, shot film of the starving men, women and children of Korem, Makale and other now-famous camps in Ethiopia. His footage showed more than gaunt farmers in dusty villages, the Africa that has long existed outside the pages of National Geographic maga-zine. Here were tens of thousands of living skeletons gathered, eerily reminiscent of Nazi concentration camps. How could the world remain indifferent?\nThe situation had become so severe because Ethiopia's present rulers had largely chosen to ignore the existence of the crisis, much as Emperor Haile Selassie, the ruler they deposed, had not acknowledged the last great famine, a decade ago. Indeed, that was one of the things that led to his overthrow.\nThis time around, there were many well-intentioned officials working for the Government's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission who did what they could. Undoubtedly, they would have wanted to do more, but the Marxist military regime gave them few resources and no real independence or authority.\nWestern journalists were routinely denied permission to travel in the countryside. Approvals were granted only after last autumn's elaborate and expensive celebration of the 10th anniversary of the revolution. Soviet, East German and other Communist-bloc journalists, some based in Addis Ababa, made no visible attempt to report on the famine.\nWhen news coverage finally did begin to focus Western concern on Ethiopia's suffering, the number of relief and development workers in that and other African nations swelled rapidly. Motivations vary, but most of the workers say that saving lives brings extraordinary satisfaction and that their life style is indeed exciting and exotic. ''It's the best job there is,'' says Copeland of Oxfam. ''Going to an office in London seems gray in comparison.'' A now-famous relief-worker T-shirt lists four basic categories - missionary, mercenary, masochist, misfit -with a box next to each for the appropriate check.\nThey come mainly, though not exclusively, from the middle class of the developed countries of the West. Although a small, influential coterie has seen action in Biafra, Bangladesh, Cambodia and other troubled areas, the majority of relief workers are young and working in disaster areas for the first time.\nFor many, the life is harsh and incredibly demanding. They bunk down in grass-and-mud huts, work 16-hour days seven days a week, suffer from an array of insect bites, abdominal disorders and other illnesses. A perverse pride often accompanies such pains, an attitude that con-veys the accusation that those who are not sick are not serious.\nRelief workers who live in relative comfort often seem embarrassed about it. ''My friends write to me saying how wonderful and amazing it is that I'm out here,'' says Helen McNaught, a New Zealander with the World Food Program in Addis Ababa. ''They say, 'This must be really changing your life.' But here I am in the Hilton, going to work in an air-conditioned office.''\nIn the camps and countryside, diversions are few. ''Fun,'' says Ken Curtin, a Brooklyn-born disaster specialist for Catholic Relief Services, ''is a cold Tang.'' Social life is restricted to whatever romantic intrigues develop during long evenings around the campfires and latrines discussing dried skim milk and diarrhea.\nMost do not earn much money. A volunteer with a private voluntary organization, Irish Concern, for example, may receive only a monthly subsistence allowance of a few hundred dollars. A high-ranking United Nations agency representative, by contrast, can earn close to $100,000 a year, including such perquisites as a large house, servants and a Mercedes Benz with a driver.\nIn the cities, relief workers always find hangouts: Ndjamena, the capital of Chad, has the Pasha Club, with its black walls and ceiling fans, as well as the more upscale Booby Bar with its revolving mirrored ball. In Khartoum, where Islamic law forbids alcohol, people meet over juice at the Acropole Hotel. Locally known as the ''Emergency Palace,'' the hotel provides its clientele with a room and three hearty meals for $20 a day. In Addis Ababa on Sunday nights, nearly everyone shows up at the Buffet de la Gare, a little nightspot by the Djibouti-Addis Ababa depot. The beer is warm, the spaghetti is cold, but a multiracial oompah band plays loud brassy music that inspires manic jocularity.\nYet, at times the life seems cloistered. Relief people mainly know only other relief people. ''And we always talk shop: food, fuel, medicine,'' complains Timpson of Save the Children. ''We're like bloody businessmen.''\nMany relief workers acknowledge another shortcoming - they rarely get to know or understand well the people they come to help. I asked a nurse in Korem working for the French-Belgian agency Doctors Without Frontiers which Ethiopian had made the deepest impression on her. She stuttered and stumbled and finally said that none stood out. Although she treats scores of people every day, the translated conversations seldom went beyond basic facts and symptoms.\n''The language barrier is huge,'' explains Tim McDonald, an American relief worker who is involved in sending food ''cross border'' into rebel areas of Ethiopia. ''The cultural barrier is also pretty wide sometimes.''\nOn one occasion, Gerry Salole, director of the American Save the Children field office in Addis Ababa, asked an Afar nomad elder to tell the two of us what he and his people knew about these aliens who had come to their land to weigh babies, give shots and hand out free grain.\n''We don't know who you are or even if you are of woman born,'' said the elder. ''But we had long heard that if we walked far enough down the road, we would find some very strange people indeed.''\nT O SHOW OFF SOME of its African development projects last summer, the United Nations Office for Emergency Operations in Africa flew five journalists of different nations to a rural area in southern Mozambique. We visited a village where we saw children whose feet and hands were infected by tiny worms. Their disfigurement was grotesque and shocking, but more significant from a developmental perspective was that the discomfort the children endured made it virtually impossible for them to work or study. They sat on the ground, many using small sharp sticks in a vain attempt to dig out the annoying creatures from beneath their swollen, blackened skin.\nThe development project had nothing to do with these sad children. It concerned maize grinding, and the key component was an automatic diesel-powered grinder mounted in a shed with a concrete floor and a thatched roof. The machine had lain idle three months, waiting for diesel fuel, which must be imported.\nToday, Mozambique requires up to $568 million a year in hard currency to import fuel, spare parts and other essential products. It earns only about $110 million a year from its exports. The difference between those sums amounts to a burgeon-ing national debt. So, because the United Nations maize project, like other schemes we saw, depends on imports but produces no exports, its effect can only be to add to Mozambique's poverty and dependence on foreign aid.\nHad someone shipped in medicine along with a few hand grinders, the children might have been able to prepare the maize. Instead,they sat in the dirt outside, while the machine stood motionless on its concrete pedestal, an unintended but appropriate monument to an all-too-common approach to development.\nA senior United Nations development official later privately conceded that this and similar projects had been ill-advised. He explained that the Government officials in Mozambique, as in so many other African countries, ''wanted to replicate the technological approaches of the developed world.'' They felt shortchanged by projects relying on human or animal labor. He said he hoped such attitudes were changing, but stressed that the United Nations could not dictate programs. ''After all, these are sovereign nations,'' he said.\nEveryone in the aid business these days agrees that relief - filling bellies - is not enough. To avoid mass famines in the future, Africa must have development, which in simplest terms means that people must learn to feed themselves. There is less agreement on how one goes about setting development in motion.\nThough many people speak of the ''developing'' countries of Africa, only a few nations are actually developing. Many more are deteriorating economically, unravelling politically and collapsing socially. Not only are farmers growing less food, factories are breaking down or closing, roads and railways are falling into disrepair, civil services are disintegrating. Standards of living, never high, are measurably declining. Since most African countries have fallen under the rule of dictatorial military regimes, the average African has no freedom to alter his situation or even to complain openly.\nThe track record of the foreign development effort in Africa has been unimpressive to date. Dams have been built, only to fill up with silt. Highways have been constructed, only to crumble because local governments could not afford to maintain them. Deep wells dug in arid landscapes have lowered the water table or allowed livestock herds to grow so large they strip the surrounding landscape of vegetation, transforming it into desert. Trees planted during the day have been chopped down at night by farmers or nomads who have no other source of fuel. Poorly devised ''food for work'' projects have attracted farmers who leave their land during planting season. Imported food aid has driven down the market price of home-grown grain, impoverishing farmers and discouraging them from trying to produce a surplus the following season.\nThe most recent conference of the International Council for Voluntary Agencies, in Senegal, concluded, in effect, that most development efforts so far have failed. ''Much of the money spent on agricultural development in Africa has simply not paid off,'' agrees Peter Brumby, the New Zealander who serves as director of the International Livestock Center for Africa in Addis Ababa.\nA large part of the explanation may be that aid organizations must work with governments that helped create the problems in the first place. And the granting of any aid, relief or development, to regimes fighting civil wars frees resources that can be used to intensify and prolong those wars. Because war is a cause of famine, aid can in that way indirectly contribute to the spread of hunger. To deny aid on that basis, however, punishes the innocent far more than the guilty.\nT HE ANSWER IS NOT to give up on aid entirely, and certainly not to give up on Africa. The continent has moved too close to our consciousness to ignore. Beyond that, Africa still has vast potential.\nAbout half the unused farmland in the world is in Africa. Many agricultural experts say that, if properly harnessed, the arable lands of Ethiopia or the Sudan alone could feed most of the continent. Africa has an abundance of natural resources. Given opportunity and a little bit of freedom, its people have shown that they can be as capable as those anywhere else, and they already seem to be hardier than most.\nThe extent to which Africa's peasants might be able to improve their own lot, given the chance, is evident in many ways. In the Ivory Coast, for example, small farmers have been getting a reasonable return for their crops since independence. The result: the Ivory Coast has become the world's largest producer of cocoa and the continent's largest producer of coffee.\nAt present, the trends look discouraging. Sixty percent of all Africans live below the poverty line, according to the World Bank. A decade from now, that figure is projected to rise to 80 percent. Such statistics should galvanize the public as much as any photograph of an emaciated baby. But, of course, they do not. As the disaster slips from the acute to the chronic - as famine temporarily retreats while poverty and hunger continue to advance - public interest is already moving on to other, fresher issues, from American farm aid to South African apartheid.\n''I intend to stay in this line of work,'' says Christopher Eldridge of the Save the Children Fund. ''If I can ease the pain of even one child, I think I've done some good. But I'm not hopeful about the larger picture. You can't look at the situation realistically and still be very hopeful.''\nIf there were a simple solution to all this, it would be in place by now. At least the dialogue does seem to have taken a more realistic turn. Few continue to argue that foreign exploitation and bad luck with the weather are all that is wrong in Africa or that the breaking of the colonial shackles guarantees ascent toward prosperity and liberty. ''The challenge in Africa today isn't even really to develop,'' says Abdul Mohammed of the Sudan Council of Churches. ''It's just to hold on to what we have, not to slide back.''\nHowever dismal the situation may appear, it is worth recalling that not so many years ago when mothers told their children about the starving of India and China, no one expected those countries to soon recover. Today, China's farmers are making unexpected advances, and India, the beneficiary of a ''green revolution,'' was one of the nations that this year donated grain to Ethiopia. The credit for these achievements belongs to the Indians and Chinese themselves. Foreigners performed at most a supporting role. Similarly, if Africa is to be saved, Africans will have to do it.\nTrends and projections are not destinies. It's just possible that a generation or so from now, Africa could surprise us all."}, {"text": "AS THEIR 'DECADE' ENDS, WOMEN TAKE STOCK\n1985-07-10T05:00:00.000Z\nMore than 11,000 women are converging on this city from at least 130 countries to bring the United Nations Decade for Women to an end. In the next three weeks, they will assess the achievements and failures of the last 10 years and plot strategy through the year 2000.\nThe unofficial portion of the conference will begin Wednesday when nongovernmental organizations start 10 days of 1,000 informal workshops called ''Forum '85.'' The gatherings will include discussion of topics such as domestic violence, women's rights in Islam, the plight of African refugee women and the exploitation of working women in Latin America.\nThere will be encounters with crafts workers, food producers and herbalists -all of them women - 200 films, exhibitions about the peace movement and day trips to rural villages to visit women who work as farmers, beekeepers, spinners and weavers and maize millers.\nThe forum will overlap the official 12-day United Nations-sponsored World Conference on Women, which will run from July 15 to 26 at the Kenyatta International Conference Center.\nThe American feminist Betty Friedan will conduct dialogues on women's issues every day at noon, in the style of African tribal chiefs, under an immense tree on the University of Nairobi camptZ and development will bring together 50 women who are lawyers, sociologists, judges and activists from 36 developing countries to discuss strategies on how to change discriminatory laws, get access to legal resources and educate women on their legal rights. For Nairobi, a Face Lift For the biggest conference ever held in this capital, the potholes have been filled, the airport highway repaved and the prostitutes swept off the streets as part of a $1.6 million Kenyan face lift.\nHotel space is so scarce that some conference participants are bedding down in $17-a-night dormitory rooms at the University of Nairobi, and tents have been pitched for tourists on the outskirts of town.\n''The best place to really get to know other women and share ideas is in the dorms,'' said Sigma Huda, a Bangladeshi lawyer and an expert on Islamic law, who checked out of her hotel to be closer to other women. ''Isn't that what we're here for?'' she asked.\nThe three themes of the conference are ''Equality, Development and Peace,'' with discussions to focus on work, health, education, global economics, political power and the victimization of women - such as the abused, the elderly, the poor, the disabled, refugees and victims of armed conflict.\nBut there is still no final working document and every indication is that the more than 3,000 official delegates will be diverted by global politics.\nThe delegations have split into three camps - East, West and ''the Group of 77,'' or developing countries - illustrating that although the subject is women, no United Nations conference can escape political concerns.\nThe Western group of 24 countries, and especially the United States hopes to avoid a repetition of the two earlier women's conferences, when delegates from the developing countries seemed so determined to redistribute resources between the rich and the poor that the redistribution of power between men and women often seemed a lesser priority.\nAt the kickoff conference in Mexico City 10 years ago, condemnations of Zionism, neocolonialism and apartheld were successfully maneuvered out of the main document. But the midpoint conference in Copenhagen five years later, paralyzed by the Palestinian issue and denunciations of Israel, produced a conference document equating Zionism with racism that the United States and Israel refused to sign.\nThe draft document for Nairobi, which theoretically should outline the not reflect the economic realities of many American women; there are not welfare mothers, for example. Critics say, too, that the delegation lacks experience and is ill-prepared to graple with the complexities of United Nations politics.\nAt least some members of the delegation disagree. ''Maureen has this thing so beautifully organized and the delegation so well briefed,'' said Nancy Clark Reynolds, a friend of the Reagan family and deputy chairman of the delegation. ''Under her leadership and with her strategy and ideas we will pull out all the stops to keep the subject on the problems of women.''\nLongtime United Nations people, however, are resigned to the infusion of global politics into the conference.\n''If you have delegates sent by and instructed by their governments, then politics is something you cannot avoid,'' said Leticia R. Shahani, the 55-year-old secretary general of the conference, who is a Filipino.\nThe liveliest exchange is expected to come in the informal workshops at the forum. ''There's not much hope for the formal conference because each government comes with its own political agenda,'' said Mimi Alperia, co-leader of the American Jewish Committee group at the forum.\nDespite the difficulties, there is a widespread hope among United Nations officials, delegates and unofficial participants that the Nairobi conference will focus attention on that half of the population that is still struggling for such rights as constitutional and legal equality, equal pay for equal work, equal education and a share of political power. ''I hope we can end the decade with a realization that there is a wide agreement on goals among the women of the world,'' Mrs. Shahani said. ''I hope Nairobi won't be a boxing match.''"}, {"text": "AN ANCIENT DISEASE ADVANCES\n1985-08-18T05:00:00.000Z\nIn Ethiopia, the authorized term is ''acute diarrhea.'' In the Sudan, the favored euphemism is ''severe gastroenteritis.'' Western physicians and medical workers say, however, that there is no longer any doubt that the disease that has spread across the Horn of Africa in the last nine months is cholera.\nThey are particularly worried because it has reached at least three important urban centers, Addis Ababa, Khartoum and Port Sudan, cities with large slum areas, where the bacterial illness, which spreads mainly through water and food contaminated by feces, is likely to be difficult to contain.\nThousands of Ethiopians and Sudanese are believed to have died of cholera this year. Children have been the chief victims. ''It seems that 50 percent of the kids who get it die,'' said Samir Sanad Basta, the Unicef representative in the Sudan. ''Perhaps that's because they have been so badly weakened by malnutrition.''\nCholera is an ancient disease, associated with poverty, filth and ignorance, and linked in the popular imagination with other dreaded killers such as bubonic plague and smallpox. In possibly the worst cholera epidemic on record, one million people are thought to have died in Russia in 1848. Cholera strikes suddenly and advances swiftly. An untreated victim may die within hours, of dehydration caused by diarrhea and vomiting. Others carry and spread the disease while exhibiting no symptoms. Last weekend, the United Nations Disaster Relief Agency reported that in Mali, a famine-stricken West African country, 500 of an estimated 2,500 cholera victims have died this year.\nHowever, with prompt public health and medical responses, a cholera epidemic no longer necessarily brings high death tolls. Patients can be saved if body fluids are replaced intravenously and antibiotics are administered. In South Africa, 2,742 cases were reported to the World Health Organization up to Aug. 2, but only four people had died from the disease.\nW.H.O. says cholera is now present in 12 African countries including two of Ethiopia's neighbors, Djibouti and Somalia, and in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Burundi, Equatorial Guinea, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, South Africa and Tanzania. (Experts say the disease also is a problem in Bangladesh, parts of China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.) Officials of the World Health Organization claim to know nothing of cholera in Ethiopia and the Sudan, reflecting a provision in the organization's charter: Unless a government formally reports an outbreak, W.H.O. does not acknowledge its existence. In Khartoum last week, relief agencies met to discuss measures to combat the cholera epidemic. Officials of W.H.O. and the Sudanese Ministry of Health did not attend. ''It's a scandal,'' a senior relief agency offical said. ''They refuse to even talk about it.''\nMany aid workers in Ethiopia and the Sudan are also reluctant to discuss cholera openly for fear of governmental retaliation. ''It's a real dilemma,'' one said. ''We're caught between the necessity not to get kicked out and the insistence of the public in the U.S. and Europe who want us to be more forthright.'' But some aid agencies have spoken up or have at least named the disease in nonconfidential reports and documents. They include the French voluntary agency, Doctors Without Borders, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the United Nations Children's Fund, and Care. The Federal Center for Disease Control in Atlanta has also determined that cholera is spreading in the Horn of Africa. ''We know cholera is there,'' said Billy Griggs, a C.D.C. expert. ''But there is no mechanism for compiling data on how many cases there are or at what rate it's spreading. Only W.H.O. could do that.''\nCholera began to show up in December at the famine relief camp in Asayita, in eastern Ethiopia. It spread east to Djibouti and Somalia and west to other Ethiopian camps and later appeared in parts of southern Ethiopia and in the northern regions of Tigre and Eritrea. Travelers returning from rebel-controlled areas of Tigre tell of victims lying on hillsides to provide rudimentary drainage for diarrhea, with intravenous units suspended from tree limbs to hold tubes connected to their arms.\nAntibiotics for Pilgrims\nRefugees from Ethiopia carried cholera into camps in eastern Sudan, where relief workers have now brought it more or less under control. Little is known about the situation in nearby villages. Until recently, cholera was rarely seen in the cities, but in the last month, hospitals in Addis Ababa, Khartoum and Port Sudan have become crowded with cases. In Addis, hastily erected tents and metal sheds are serving as isolation units. In Khartoum, Moslems boarding planes for the pilgrimage to Mecca are being given the antibiotic tetracycline as a precaution. In Port Sudan, the central market has been closed to prevent further transmissions.\nWhy do some governments disguise so serious a problem? ''That's not for me to answer,'' said Gino Levi, a W.H.O. spokesman in Geneva. Sudanese and Ethiopian officials are equally unresponsive. One reason may be fear of losing customers for exports. In fact, experts say, it is unlikely that cholera has ever been transmitted by East African products such as coffee, cotton and hides. Others speculate that governments want to avoid the image of squalor that cholera suggests and the limitations that acknowledgement of an epidemic imposes. Population movement would be restricted, interfering with Ethiopia's resettlement plans for one million people from the north. ''Cholera doesn't need to be quite so devastating if it is approached rationally and sensibly,'' said Dr. A .D. Brandling-Bennet, a Nairobi-based physician who has worked with the disease in Africa and Asia. ''The fatal error is not to admit it'' is present. Health workers predict that the fatality total will indeed be large. ''By the end of the year, we can expect 5,000 to 10,000 dead in this country alone,'' said Dr. Didier Patte, Unicef's emergency officer in the Sudan."}, {"text": "LUCK THAT SEEMS LIKE TORTURE\n1985-11-03T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE CITY OF JOY By Dominique Lapierre Translated by Kathryn Spink. 464 pp. New York: Doubleday & Company. $17.95.\nAN Indian proverb says that if a bag of Calcutta dust is put under the bed of a virtuous man or woman, he or she will become corrupt. But there are some, not a few, but millions, who must be exempt becuase they have no bed; they sleep on a plank laid on bricks or over a gutter, if they are lucky, or on the pavement or any space they can find. These are the refugees from Bangladesh, Bihar, Assam or the refugees from their own countryside, who flock into the city, adding themselves to its already swarming poor.\nCalcutta was built for exploitation, but for farily benevolent exploitation, not virulent as it is now. ''If it was possible to steal the air we breathe, there'd be people in Calcutta prepared to do it,'' one character says, quoting Ram Chander. He is a wise and generous rickshaw puller, one of the innumerable lesser characters of ''The City of Joy,'' Dominique Lapierre's new book in the nonfiction historical genre he and Larry Collis, used in such popular successes as ''Is Paris Burning?'' about the liberation of Paris and ''Freedom at Midnight,'' about the partition of India.\n''The City of Joy'' is about suffering, sorrow, cruelty and deprivation; about practicies so hideous as almost to suspend belief, though they are shockingly true. It is about filth, rags, wounds, disease, even leprosy. Repulsive words. Yet even more, the book is about other words that wonderfully leaven the whole: loyalty, kindness, tolerance, generosity, patience, endurance, acceptance, faith, even holiness. And it is about such love that we cannot pass by on the other side. In any case, it is too fascinating to allow us to do that.\nThe City of Joy is a Calcutta slum where more than 70,000 people congregate on ''ground hardly three times the size of a football field,'' a place fo vermin-infested hovels and shanties, ''without a single flower, a butterfly, or a bird, apart from vultures and crows - it was a place where children did not even know what a bush, a forest or a pond was, where the air is so laden with carbon dioxide and sulphur that pollution killed at least one member in every family; a place where men and beasts baked in a furnace for the eight months of summer until the monsoon transformed their alleyways and shacks into lakes of mud and excrement.''\nSeemingly outside legislation or the rule of law, the City of Joy is ruled by a coalition of gangsters with no curb on extortion and abuse, yet this bustee (Indian township) city has a proverb of its own quite different from Calcutta's. It is a proud motto, ''All that is not given is lost.'' Given, not taken. perhaps in the sharing of the family's last chapati, a life-giving cup of coconut milk. Even a pice, worth one-tenth of a cent, will buy something in India. Any of us who have made a gift, especially to someone in need, knows what a feeling of warmth and happiness that brings, not to the one who receives as Much as to the one who gives. Giving is the secret of the joy in the City of Joy. * * * The book is told chiefly through two people, a Bengali peasant, Hasari Pal, and Stephan Kovalski, a young Polish priest with a passionate mission who becomes Stephan Daddah, the ''big brother,'' to the inhabitants of the city. In truth I do not know which story was the most moving.\nHasari Pal's story begins in what has become a classic Indian opening - his village is waiting for the vital monsoon. All peasants in India live by the ancient Vedic gods, far older than Hinduism or, for that matter, Buddhism, Islam, Judaism or Christianity. These gods are the ''shining ones'': Bhu-Devi, the earth goddess; Surya the sun god; Agni, the god of fire, and, for the nascence of this book in particular, Indira, the goddess of rain and storm, who can bring a rainbow, a sign to these simple people of a good harvest.\nIn 1981 there was no rainbow, no rain; not the slightest trace of cloud. The sky remained steely white, ''the luminous emerald green soon changed first to gray green and then to a yellowish color. The rice drooped, then wilted and finally died.''\nFor Bengali peasants, the line between poverty and destitution is so tightly drawn that at the least strain it snaps. The Pals were already in debt to the money-lender (every village has its usurer), so they had to eat the rice they had stored for seed. Vultures, in the form of greedy traders, came to buy for a pittance the one cow left alive and the hide of the other. They bought the farm implements and, of course, the treasured jewelery, down to the smallest nose-ring. There was nothing left. Hasari decided to set off with his family for Calcutta and its cruelly beckoning mirage of work.\nHasari Pal was lucky, though his luck seems to the reader more like torture. For months his home was cramped space on a pavement by a gutter; his first earnings were made when a coolie pulling a rickshaw fell under his load and Hasari took his place. Discovering that pirate blood-banks paid money for blood, he tried to give his every week, and nobody stopped him until a stranger took pity, telling Hasari, ''if you don't watch out your family'll soon be seeing your ashes floating on the Hooghly [River] .'' Eventually Hasari succeeded in becoming a ''human horse,'' a rickshaw puller like his friend, Ram Chander. Mr. Lapierre describes the private world of richshaw wallahs with wonderful skill.\nMeanwhile, Stephan Kovalski had chosen to live in the City of Joy, its only white man, sharing its life even to the extent of nearly dying of the chief epidemic, cholera. It was his poor neighbors who rescued him, and even then he refused to go to any but the poorest Indian hospital. How deep was his affinity with the city is shown when, in the bewilderment of his first morning there, trying to make his usual morning ritual, he could not remember the prayers and psalms but found himself reciting ''Om,'' which, in Indian religions, is the most powerful and spiritual of all sounds. ''OM... Jesus, om... Jesus'' and, ''after a moment, I was once more in His presence,'' he said.\n''The City of Joy'' really needs weeks, if not months, of intimate reading. But form the opening description of Hasari Pal - ''He had the appearance of a Mogul warrior'' - to the end, through cataclysmic catastrophe to typically fresh hope, the book is imprinted on my mind, I think, forever.\nFor all its vivid realism, this is a profoundly religious book - it expresses the best of all religions, one in which barriers and classifications are lost because it is beneath, or above, the people. Faith brings dignity: for each person in the slum, the squalid mornings begin with the purification of ablution, washing and prayer. Before any event, out of the little they have, the first thing anyone does is make an offering to God. Muslim women help their Hindu sisters to find clothes and precious food for their festivals; the Hindus help the Muslims. Everyone joins in every festival because these poorest of the poor have the wisdom to know how necessary a few days of gala are to leaven the rest, even if it means weeks of denial beforehand.\nAll join, too, in the continuous collections of money: to help a fmaily marry their daughter (always expensive), to redeem a rickshaw impounded by the police, to bribe a sick person's way into the hospital, to pay for a funeral, be it for a burial, earth to earth, or the burning of the corpse by the river.\n''THE CITY OF JOY'' has already been published in a number of European countries, to accolades and great success. I haven't the slightest doubt that it will reap the same in the United States, deservedly so, and it seems captious to make the smallest cavil. Yet a balance must be struck.\nSometimes the translation from Mr. Lapierre's native French is jarring to the reader, with an uneven mixture of slightly archaic constructions, a formality mixed with slangy collogquialisms, such as ''he was a nice guy.''\nFar more important than such quibbles, the book is, in a way, too overwhelming. It tells so much that the mind becomes numbed, as happens in a famine or cyclone - I have known both - when compassion ceases simply because the heart can take no more.\nProbably, though, other readers are stronger than I and the brilliant reportage will carry them through. As a writer, though, I regret that the Lapierres - for the author includes his wfie among many who assisted in his research - did not let the story tell itself through just one character. Not Stephan Kovalski, because there are others like him, though even Mother Teresa, the Nobel laureate, is not as integrated a figure as he. Had it been told entirely through Hasari Pal, the book might not have been as valuable as journalism, but it would have been a masterpiece.\nWith Mother Teresa as a Guide\nDominique Lapierre, a former journalist with Paris-Match, is best known for his writing partnerhsip with Larry Collins, a former journalist with Newsweek. They first met when Mr. Lapierre served as an interpreter with Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers, Europe, after World War II. There followed such international best sellers in fact-and-thriller documentary style as ''Is Paris Burning?'' ''Freedom at Midnight'' and ''The Fifth Horseman.'' The success of the books liberated the authors form journalistic deadlines and enabled them to become neighbors in the south of France. This time, Mr. Lapierre is on his own.\n''When I arrived in Calcutta in 1981, I had no intention of writing aything,'' Mr. Lapierre said during a recent visit to New York. ''My wife and I adopted a home for 150 children of lepers in northern Calcutta. Mother Teresa took us to one of the slums in a small area that translates as City of Joy. The people live there on less than 10 cents a day. And yet I saw more joy, more compassion, more God-loving than anywhere in my 30 years as a writer. It was an inspiration.\n''So one day I went to a bookshop and bought 10 notebooks and 12 ball point pens and stayed in Calcutta for two years. I knew I had to tell this epic of hope and love and joy. Half the royalties from 'City of Joy' are going back to Calcutta in the form of mobile medical units and other aid to the gallant people working and living there.''\nHerbert Mitgang"}, {"text": "LIVE AID AND THE WOODSTOCK NATION\n1985-07-18T05:00:00.000Z\nIt was the word on everybody's lips at the Live Aid concert last Saturday in Philadelphia. ''Woodstock II,'' said the rock star Neil Young. ''It's your Woodstock,'' the singer Joan Baez told the crowd in John F. Kennedy Stadium. Seventeen-year-old Tom Teter of Vineland, N.J., agreed:\n''It's our Woodstock and it's just as good.''\nThere was abundant reason for the comparison. The organizers of Live Aid consciously harkened to the 1969 festival, a counterculture conclave that led Abbie Hoffman to coin the term ''Woodstock Nation'' for America's young. And certainly Live Aid as an event, a spectacle, addressed the desire of many fans - people in their teens or 20's who know Woodstock as an icon of the decade they worship - to enact their vision of the 1960's.\nBut if Woodstock was the obvious point of reference for the mammoth Live Aid shows in Philadelphia and London - seen by 162,000 fans in Kennedy and Wembley Stadiums and an estimated 1.5 billion on a worldwide television broadcast - it was not necessarily the right one. If anything, the distance from a rain-soaked dairy farm in Bethel, N.Y., to a state-of-the-art stage in Philadelphia is measured in much more than 16 years and a few hundred miles.\nDecades of Difference\nBetween then and now, rock-and-roll has moved from the turbulent, youthful fringe into the vast middle ground of American culture and commerce. Its audience - and in many cases, performers - has turned from social rebels to solid citizens. Woodstock was on the surface an apolitical event, promising merely ''three days of music and peace,'' which took on enormous resonance more by what it represented than by what it said outright. Live Aid was a political event - in that it was created solely to raise money for African famine relief -that largely appealed to fans as a mega-concert.\n''You've got to face the reality of the event,'' said Bill Graham, the promoter of the Live Aid concert. ''People are concerned about the plight in Africa, but if there was no famine, we'd have sold as many tickets.'' Whatever the motive, the harvest was handsome indeed. In a single day, Live Aid raised an estimated $70 million, far outstripping the figure from such renowned rock charity events as George Harrison's 1971 Concert for Bangladesh.\nThe differences between Woodstock and Live Aid, which is to say between America in 1969 and America in 1985, show up in many specific ways, too. Woodstock was a chaotic, anarchic happening that sprawled over three days; Live Aid's 14-hour Philadelphia concert ran only three minutes overtime. Where hippie entrepreneurs sold hallucinogens at Woodstock - there were two drug-related deaths and hundreds of ''bad trips'' from LSD - the drug of choice at Live Aid was beer. The lasting images of Woodstock include skinny-dippers in a wallow called ''Passion Puddle''; the crowd at Live Aid had short hair and waved the Stars and Stripes. One fan arrived in a limousine, from which his chauffeur watched the show on a built-in television.\nAppeal for 40-Year-Olds\nLive Aid was the kind of rock concert even a parent could like, especially since the typical parent of teen-age children today grew up on the Beatles, Bob Dylan and Elvis Presley. And that was part of the point in the packaging of Live Aid.\n''This show was designed to be most appreciated by a 40-year-old,'' said Michael C. Mitchell, president of Worldwide Sports and Entertainment, the company that produced the Live Aid telecast. ''It's their music -Joan Baez, Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan. We took a lot of performers from 1960 to 1980 and very few since. If the show aimed only at the kids - the 16-, 17-, 18-year-olds - we'd have a problem. They don't give money.'' Besides individual performers with roots in the 1960's in general and Woodstock in particular, Live Aid offered the reunions of period bands such as the Who, Led Zeppelin and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. These performances added to the sense of a once-in-a-lifetime event, but they also threw the passage of time into clear relief. David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash and Neil Young played together in public for the first time ever at Woodstock. By the time they reassembled for Live Aid, Mr. Nash was graying at the temples, Mr. Stills had a double chin, Mr. Crosby had been convicted on drug and gun-possession charges and Mr. Young had endorsed Ronald Reagan for President.\n'Longing for the 60's'\nSuch 1960's stars, though, continue to carry a mythological importance for the teen-aged audience that filled Kennedy Stadium. ''It might be that the children of the 80's are longing for a Woodstock, longing for the 60's,'' Miss Baez said. ''The similarity I felt between Woodstock and Live Aid was that desire for some unwritten solidarity, for a chance for their community to come together.'' Another part of the nostalgia for the 60's is the desire for a sense of commitment, and the African famine, like the campaign for American institutions to divest themselves of their holdings in South Africa, provided such a rallying point.\nAt the same time, Miss Baez said, she doubted how much Saturday's audience really shared with the 500,000 at Woodstock. ''I wondered what kind of problems they have,'' she said of the Live Aid spectators. ''At Woodstock, you had the war, rebellion against parents, bad acid - a rainbow of things. These kids in Philadelphia had cooled out to 'feel good about themselves.' It's not easy to ruffle them.''\nOther observers attacked what they saw as the concert's calculated show of conscience. ''I think it's great if the money raised does save lives,'' said Greil Marcus, author of ''Mystery Train'' and rock music columnist for Art Forum magazine. ''But it was an enormous orgy of self-satisfaction, self-congratulation.''\n''It's good people wanted to do something about the famine and I'll be gladder when the money gets to Africa,'' said Marshall Berman, a professor of political science at the City University of New York and the author of ''All That Is Solid Melts Into Air: The Experience of Modernity.'' ''But a little humility and wariness wouldn't hurt.''\nA Global Language\nWhat seems indisputable, however, is that Live Aid deeply changed the rules of what a rock concert is. While Woodstock ushered in the era of the gargantuan outdoor festival - Altamont, Powder Ridge and Watkins Glen followed - Live Aid was a case of what Neil Young called ''high tech meeting the 60's.'' If the concert itself was modeled on Woodstock, the broadcast borrowed more from the 1984 Olympics and the Jerry Lewis telethon.\nIn place of Woodstock's communion on a soggy hillside, Live Aid's worldwide audience overwhelmingly experienced the event through television. The broadcast intercut footage from concerts in Philadelphia, London and several foreign countries with fund-raising appeals by prominent politicians, artists and sports stars. Even in Kennedy Stadium itself, the crowd did not watch the performers as much as it watched their images on several huge video monitors. It was the Marshall McLuhan ''global village'' prophecy come to pass.\nThe fact that rock-and-roll was the Esperanto of the ''global village'' was itself significant. In 1969, Woodstock's promoters had to scramble to find anybody willing to provide land for a festival. In 1985, Philadelphia officials grabbed the Live Aid concert as a way of rehabilitating the city's image in the aftermath of the Move tragedy. The concert in turn was carried by network television, FM rock stations and a 24-hour rock cable station - manifestations of a rock-based economy that was only in its infancy during Woodstock.\n''Finally, the music industry was looked at on such a high level,'' said Mr. Graham, who began promoting rock concerts 20 years ago and has organized a number of charity shows. ''And finally, the world at large realizes there are people in our industry who do things about their beliefs. For the world I work in, this was our finest hour. By far.''"}, {"text": "DRUMS OF ROCK MUSIC BEAT FOR DIFFERENT CAUSES\n1985-09-21T05:00:00.000Z\nWhen 40 leading rock and country bands perform a benefit concert for American farmers tomorrow, they will underscore the new impact of popular musicians on political and charitable causes - efforts that have raised more than $100 million this year alone.\nFarm Aid - as Sunday's 12-hour concert and broadcast from Urbana, Ill., is called - comes only two months after the Live Aid concerts, which have raised more than $60 million for Ethiopian famine relief.\nNext week will also see the release of ''Sun City,'' a benefit single for the anti-apartheid movement, which features Bruce Springsteen, Miles Davis and dozens of other performers. Popular music is also raising money for such causes as the Greenpeace Foundation and teen-age suicide prevention. Farm Aid addresses a more local and more partisan issue - the American family farm - than did Live Aid, but the concert itself will be modeled on the Live Aid shows.\nThe upsurge in rock benefits follows a decade, the 1970's, in which some musicians' political and charitable efforts were submerged in a widespread perception of rock music as complacent.\nWhere rock in the 1960's was often adversarial - anthems of a counterculture - rock in the 1980's is part of mainstream culture and has the clout of television and radio. Performers who sell millions of records worldwide have developed a new sense of their power and influence, and have begun to see themselves as participants on a world stage.\n''We were knocking on the door in the 1960's,'' said Ken Kragen, who manages Lionel Richie and who organized the U.S.A. for Africa recording. ''Now, we have the keys.''\nJohn Cougar Mellencamp, the multimillion-selling songwriter who is one of Farm Aid's organizers, said: ''If I can't do something good with my popularity, what good is it? I used to think what I wrote made no more difference than the man in the moon; I found out I really do have some kind of responsibility.''\nSocial Impact of Music\nMusicians, entertainment-industry executives and volunteer organizations point to three reasons for the vastly increased social impact of popular music.\nOne is the new willingness of performers to band together, as in the all-star rock and country-music roster for Farm Aid, the 45-member group that recorded ''We Are the World'' and the lineup that gathered July 13 at the Live Aid concerts.\nBilly Joel, who will perform at Farm Aid, said: ''Everyone I know in this business has been contributing to charities for years. The exciting thing now is that a lot of musicians are getting together for causes.''\nA second reason is that more composers and performers are contributing record royalties to causes.The current spate of all-star benefits was sparked by ''Do They Know It's Christmas?'' a single released last November by a British all-star assembly called Band Aid. Bob Geldof, who assembled Band Aid, went on to organize the Live Aid concerts.\nUnlike the one-time-only benefit concerts of earlier decades, a record can raise money as long as it is in print. ''We Are the World,'' a compilation of British rock called ''Greenpeace'' that was donated to the ecology activist foundation, and Billy Joel's single ''You're Only Human,'' donated to the National Committee for Youth Suicide Prevention, all continue to generate funds.\nThe third, and perhaps most important, reason is rock's new visibility. Top performers are now seen regularly on television in video clips. And with the combination of all-star assemblies and wider media interest, it can be good business to broadcast a benefit nationally or even internationally - and the concert's audience of potential donors grows accordingly.\n''Television is the catalyst,'' said Bob Pittman, chief operating officer of the MTV cable channel. '''It couldn't happen without the artists involved, but if you had no access to show that to 30 or 40 million homes, it wouldn't be such an event. ''\nDifferent Sort of Benefit\nFarm Aid, the finale of which will be broadcast live on ABC-TV and which will be shown in its entirety, from 1 P.M. Sunday to 1 A.M. Monday, on the Nashville Network cable-TV channel (Manhattan Cable will air it on Channel V) addresses a different sort of issue than previous giant benefits. Unlike world hunger, a problem that has enlisted rock performers at least since the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh, saving the family farm is a domestic, partisan, American issue; the aid will affect the artists' own audiences and potential record-buyers.\nFarm Aid was initiated by the country singer Willie Nelson who, with Mr. Mellencamp and the songwriter Neil Young, assembled performers associated with rock and country music. Such performers obviously do not mind being seen nationwide. But Mr. Mellencamp said: ''This is for the farmers. I haven't had one performer ask, 'Where am I going to be on the bill?' ''\nAt recent concerts in Giants Stadium in the New Jersey Meadowlands, Bruce Springsteen urged his audiences to contact local efforts such as the Food and Hunger Hotline of New York. Christina Walker, executive director of that program, said, ''We had a big increase in calls from people willing to volunteer, and many donations.''\nThere has been some skepticism about the results of major fund-raising events such as Live Aid and the ''We Are the World'' records. The Live Aid Foundation, which administers Live Aid and Band Aid funds, has so far spent only $10 million of its $60 million on relief efforts and transport in the Sudan, Ethiopia and Mozambique. ''Rather than just throwing our money around, we want to spend it on things that will have a long-term impact,'' said Zoe Miller, project director of the Live Aid Foundation.\nU.S.A. for Africa, which has raised $34 million in the United States and an estimated $15 million abroad, will announce its allocations for $17 million in Africa and $5 million in the United States next week; another $17 million is earmarked for recovery and development projects under study.\nFor all the causes and all the funds rock has generated, no one involved with the benefits expects private contributions to solve the problems.\n''I got involved in this thing to inform people,'' Mr. Mellencamp said. ''Money helps, but it doesn't make things work. The money may be a temporary Band-Aid on the problem - but I'll be happy if we can raise consciousness and get people involved again.''"}, {"text": "Article 062961 -- No Title\n1985-10-08T05:00:00.000Z\nFinancial leaders from around the world have agreed to set aside $2.7 billion from the International Monetary Fund for a special lending pool to help the poorest countries promote economic growth.\nThe program, announced here on Monday at the joint meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, would largely be available for drought-stricken countries of sub-Saharan Africa.\nOne aim of the new lending pool apparently is to provide the type of emergency funds that the I.M.F. is accustomed to providing, but without the same short payback requirements and without the austerity measures that would restrict economic potential.\nBroad New Approach\nThe establishment of the special fund is in line with a new approach to third world lending that Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d planned to outline in a speech to the meeting's delegates this afternoon.\nAt a news conference this morning he said that, in addition to supporting the new special fund, he also would be recommending an ''enhanced'' role for the World Bank.\nThe enlarged function he envisioned would expand World Bank guarantees of loans by commercial banks and would speed up disbursements of its own loans. It would make more loans to countries conditioned on their implementing policies to attract more commerical bank lending.\nPlan Is Scaled Back\nMr. Baker, however, did not propose, as it was expected he would, that the special fund to help the poorest nations be set up with initially with at least $5 billion, including a hefty contribution from the World Bank. He said in an interview that ''We scaled it back as a consequence of the timidity on the part of others and bureaucratic opposition.''\nBanking sources said that talks would continue with the World Bank and other multilateral institutions to bolster the special $2.7 billion fund that was agreed upon yesterday.\nThe United States might also contribute additional money to the special fund if other groups step forward as well. In a copy of remarks made at the meeting where the new fund was established, Mr. Baker was quoted as saying that ''the United States would be prepared to consider seeking additional resources in support of such a bolder approach if other donors were prepared to make equitable contributions.''\nHe cited no figures, but American officials have said that the United States would be prepared to put $500 million from bilateral assistance programs into the special fund. $20 Billion Rise For Banks In outlining the broader approach to third world lending, Mr. Baker projected a $20 billion rise in lending by commercial banks over the next three years, an annual increase of 2 1/2 percent, and a 50 percent increase to the $27 billion level in lending to the 15 largest debtor countries by the World Bank and other smaller multilateral lending institutions.\nThe new money from the World Bank and other multilateral institutions would come from additional borrowing in the capital markets and from contributions by member countries.\nIn the speech that he prepared for delivery this afternoon, Mr. Baker said, ''The cornerstone of sustained growth must be domestic savings, and investment of those savings at home.'' At his press conference, Mr. Baker said one of the gauges of success of the new policies would be whether countries would be able to arrest movements of flight capital, which is money that the citizens of a country invest outside their borders.\nMoving on Three Fronts\nAs it appears now, the United States is moving on three fronts to help strengthen the world economy, which in turn would benefit the United States by creating more demand for its products. The three fronts are:\n* Helping to create the new special fund for the countries in need of immediate assistance, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa. Terms for repayment of the loans would be less onerous and more conducive to promoting long-term economic growth.\n* Proposing to ease the Latin American debt crisis by suggesting ways to encourage more commercial bank lending. One proposal would be for the World Bank to provide some form of guarantee for loans made to less-developed countries.\n* Backing higher lending amounts by the World Bank to the third world. This would be tied in with the plans to promote more commercial bank lending and with a proposal Mr. Baker is expected to make for closer collaboration between the monetary fund and the World Bank.\nIn his news conference this morning, Mr. Baker said he was confident ''that, if all the participants in this strategy do their part,'' adequate resources would be available. He cautioned , however, that, ''like a chain, a strategy is as strong as the weakest link.''\nHe denied that he intended to put pressure on commercial banks to increase their lending. ''The banks will participate because they see that it is in their interest to do so,'' he said. Mr. Baker added that, ''clearly, there will have to be a closer look at what the regulatory authorities require.'' Although he did not provide details, the implication was that the Treasury would be in consultation with American bank regulatory authorities to try to get them to arrive at a more flexible attitude toward the impact that third world lending has on a bank's balance sheet.\nLoans granted from the new $2.7 billion special fund would go to countries whose average per capita income is below $410 and which have had protracted problems generating enough foreign currency to pay for essential imports.\nThe special fund will be financed by repayments due over the next three to four years on loans made by the monetary fund in 1976 to ease the shock of higher oil prices. This means that there will be no new assessments on monetary fund members. Also, since the oil-induced loans of 1976 were part of a special emergency program, the diversion of those loan procedds will not reduce the resources available for other monetary fund programs.\nThe $2.7 billion plan differs from existing monetary fund programs in that the goal is that the World Bank and the I.M.F. would cooperate in running the special fund.\nTypically, the monetary fund lends money to countries to help them overcome short-term balance-of-payments crises and imposes economic austerity conditions on the loans. The World Bank lends over the longer term to help build roads, dams and other projects that strengthen economic potential.\nThe communique of the monetary fund's interim committee that set up the special fund said that, in operating it, the I.M.F. ''should work in close collaboration with the World Bank, whilst avoiding cross conditionality.'' This was a reference to the possibility of two different belt-tightening conditions the I.M.F. and the World Bank would impose on the countries receiving the loans that may hold back economic growth in the long run.\nAs a condition for its loans, the monetary fund often imposes budget deficit targets that cause a country to cut back on investments. Yet these investments may be those that got under way as a result of help from the World Bank, which typically has its own conditions for the loans.\nSpur to Economies\nThe $2.7 special fund program is expected to spur the economies of the world's poorest countries. China and India, which have credit ratings high enough to borrow in international capital markets, volunteered not to tap the new line of easy credit, even though low average income would have qualified them for such help.\nThe special fund will offer loans at one-half of 1 percent interest with a five-year repayment period and a grace period before repayments start of five and a half years.\nThe fund would be available to countries eligible for help by the World Bank's International Development Association. Last year, there were 45 I.D.A. recipients, including India and China. The new fund is supposed to supplement the role of the association, which makes 50-year loans to the poorest countries at no interest and only three-quarters of 1 percent as a service charge.\nThe special fund is designed principally for countries that ''face protracted balance-of-payments problems,'' according to the communique. An increasing number of African coutries, hit by the recent drought and years of economic mismanagement, face such problems. 40 Countries in Area Altogether there are 40 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, most of which are eligible for assistance from the development association.\nThe countries that received assistance from the development association in the year ended June 30 are: Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, China, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Grenada, Republic of Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, India, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania and Mozambique.\nAlso Nepal, Niger, Pakistan, Rwanda, Sao Tome e Principe, Senegal, Solomon Islands, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Western Samoa, Yemen, Southern Yemen, Zaire and Zambia."}, {"text": "OLD-TIME CHINA TRADER: JACK SHAMASH; BROKERING DEALS BETWEEN EAST AND WEST\n1985-01-13T05:00:00.000Z\nWASHINGTON IN Dalien, a town in northern China,\nJack Shamash, a New York-based\ntrader, recently closed a deal, then celebrated with his partners at a multi-course banquet highlighted by toasts of mao tai, a fiery Chinese liquor, and servings of crunchy fried silkworms.\nThe cashew-sized silkworms, a not uncommon food in China, were singularly appropriate. Mr. Shamash had just signed a joint venture with the China Silk Corporation, one of the biggest of the state-owned enterprises. It produces silk in 27 of China's 29 provinces and employs 50 million workers.\nMr. Shamash and his Western partner in the Dalien venture, Courtaulds Ltd., of London, each agreed to invest $1.5 million to set up a dyeing and finishing plant in China for tussah silk, a rough-textured fabric used for blazers and other sportswear. His family-owned trading company, S. Shamash & Sons Inc., of New York, will market the fabric to apparel makers worldwide. Courtaulds, an old-line British textile producer, is supplying the manufacturing and technical skill.\nThe United States imports $100 million worth of silk annually, of which about $20 million comes from China - and 80 percent of the Chinese imports are handled by the Shamash company. The roots of this relationship go back a century. The 60-year- old Mr. Shamash, who was born in Baghdad but came to New York City as a teen-ager, is descended from a family of wealthy Iraqi merchants that has traded with China for more than 100 years.\nINDEED, Mr. Shamash is a rarity\n- one of the few China traders\nthat survive in America after the years of China's isolation from the West. With the doors wide open again, S. Shamash & Sons is booming, and Mr. Shamash is acting not only as a textile merchant, but also as a broker for other American companies seeking deals with the Chinese.\nAs the leading silk importer into the United States, he has a network of contacts both in Peking and the provinces. Now that the provinces have been given more economic autonomy, Mr. Shamash is being called on increasingly to advise them both on investment and export policies. He recently helped Sichuan Province, for example, on the sale of glassware to the United States.\nAt the same time, through new relationships with Jardine-Matheson, the giant Hong Kong trading company, and the Minneapolis-based Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, as well as with Courtaulds, he is actively engaged in helping American and other foreign companies either sell or invest in China through joint ventures with the Chinese.\nAnd these joint ventures are growing in number, for two main reasons. The first is that Peking in the past two years has greatly sweetened tax and other incentives to attract foreign capital. For example, companies in designated economic zones can import components duty-free, are given much greater freedom to hire and fire workers and they benefit from a tax on profits of only 15 percent, as opposed to 30 percent elsewhere in China.\nThe second reason, said Christopher H. Phillips, president of the National Council for U.S.-China Trade, which has a membership of more than 400 American companies, is the ''real interest'' of American concerns in penetrating the Chinese market. ''They know that exporting finished goods is not the long-term answer. Rather it is to get into China and produce in China.''\nTHAT puts a premium on brokers\nlike Mr. Shamash. At the recent\nDalien banquet, Luo Jian-Hua, director of the Liaoning Province branch of China Silk, toasted his new business partner, observing that businessmen like Mr. Shamash have now become the diplomats of his country. Then he urged his guest to take another helping of fried silkworms.\n''They have a nutty flavor,'' Mr. Shamash reported later, ''a little like peanuts, maybe more like walnuts. Before indulging,'' he added with a grin, ''I generally steel myself with mao tai.''\nApart from exotic foods, there are more serious cultural differences to contend with. The Chinese are often baffled by the American marketing system - what, for example, Christmas means to the textile trade. A lot of effort goes into explaining that if goods are not shipped by February, they will not be in the stores by Christmas.\nThe business sometimes brings unexpected problems - and reverses. In mid-1984, for example, one of the leading Chinese silk suppliers without warning raised prices 25 to 30 percent. Mr. Shamash knew he could n't absorb increases of this size, yet if he told his customers that the Chinese were raising prices they wouldn't believe him.\n''They would think we were stealing from them,'' explained the firm's vice president, Jeffrey White, who is also Mr. Shamash's nephew. The uncle dispatched his nephew on a special mission to resolve the situation. The result was that the Chinese ''reduced their price increases a little, and we increased our prices a little,'' said Mr. White.\nMoving goods is a continuing problem. There is only one boat a month from Dalien to the United States, for example, and merchants fight for space. Personal travel is equally frustrating. Planes and trains are almost always fully booked. Mr. Shamash has at times waited days for a train ticket and once stood all night on a 12- hour ride.\nWhen he is not in Dalien, Mr. Shamash may be in Peking, Shanghai or Guangzhou, or in the provinces of Tianjin, Hunan, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Jiangsu, Henan, Shandong, Sichuan or Xian. He makes several trips annually, spending two to three months a year in China. The gray-haired trader travels with a guide, but rarely uses an interpreter, relying instead on what he describes as passable Mandarin.\nTypically, after a flight to a provincial city, a shaky, vintage Toyota will take him from the airport to hotels like the Dalien, a faded and cracked structure in Dalien, or the New Swan Hotel in Harbin, a city in Heilongiang Province. Sometimes he stops at the Shanghai Peace Hotel, which used to be owned by a trading company that both his grandfather and father had been connected with.\n''Our family has been associated with China for 100 years, starting with my grandfather, Saleh Shamash, who represented E.D. Sassoon, a Baghdad-based company with branches in India and China,'' Mr. Shamash explained. ''Basically they traded in teas, silks and opium.''\nSaleh Shamash not only represented the Sassoon trading company but was related to the Sassoon family by marriage, and named his son for them. Sassoon Shamash established his own trading company, first in Baghdad and later in New York. His son - who early on simplified his given name from Jacques to Jack - was sent from Baghdad to school in England, but completed his education at Horace Mann High School in the Bronx and the University of Virginia. Then he joined the family business in New York, and resumed his travels to to China although he never lived there.\nIn 1949, after the Communists won the Chinese civil war and established a new Government in Peking, Sassoon Shamash moved his Far East operations out of China to Japan, and concentrated on developing trade with Koreans. But in April 1972, two months after President Nixon's epochal trip to Peking, S. Shamash & Sons was invited by the Government to return to the China silk business.\n''China trade runs in the blood,'' Mr. Shamash said. ''That's probably why they invited us back. They're strong believers in tradition.''\n''Personal relationships are extremely important in China,'' he continued. ''Once they know you and you gain their trust you're a friend of theirs for life, and all doors are unlocked for you without lengthy red tape.''\nHis company was the first buyer of Chinese silk in 1972, and today it trades with 12 provinces, Mr. Shamash notes with pride. However, imports of Chinese silk into the United States did not become commercially important until 1979 when Peking signed a trade agreement that gave it most favored nation status and lowered silk import duties to 5 percent from 40 percent.\nMr. Shamash's business was not much affected by last year's dispute between China and the United States over American textile quotas; both silk and linen, the main fabrics he imports, are quota-free.\nFrom the base of his personal contacts and his assets in the silk trade, Mr. Shamash has moved into new trading fields. He acts as if he were a merchant banker, shepherding businessmen around the minstries and provincial power bases, arranging introductions and invitations to trade fairs. He will also work out financing, sometimes from his company's own resources, he says.\nIn addition, he is an expert in ''countertrade,'' the barter arrangements in which imports are financed not by cash but by goods that the selling company either uses or sells in the world market. Countertrade is an essential aspect of Chinese international trade dealings.\n''The major advantage,'' explained Thaddeus C. Kopinski, a trade specialist at Business International, a business information and consulting group, ''is that it eliminates having to obtain Chinese Government approval for foreign exchange to leave the country, which can be a complicated and tedious process.''\nBESIDES arranging deals for others, Mr. Shamash is rapidly expanding his own operations. His venture with 3M has been profitable from the day it started last September, he claims. First 3M-Shamash, which is based in Shanghai, sold local glassware to a Middle West buyer; now it is negotiating to sell cotton fabrics and yarn to Bangladesh, Italy and several Eastern bloc countries.\nMr. Shamash's textile business has put him in frequent contact with officials such as He Shoulun, vice governor of the northeastern Province of Heilongjiang. Under Peking's decentralization policies, Mr. He controls 10 provincial corporations in such sectors as linen-weaving, agriculture, light industry and chemicals. ''We buy a lot of linen from the province,'' Mr. Shamash said, explaining the basis of the friendship.\nAt yet another of the interminable banquets that China traders suffer gladly - this one at Harbin's New Swan Hotel - Mr. He gave his guest a shopping list of equipment the province needs to modernize its industry. The newest textile plants, for example, were built by the Russians in the mid-1950's.\nMr. Shamash said he is working with Courtaulds and his other partners to help supply the equipment.\n''One of the things the Chinese want is an ice cream plant,'' he reported, noting that a taste for ice cream is something the Chinese learned from the Russians. Characteristically, Mr. Shamash and his partners are arranging the financing.\nMr. Shamash is a short, thick-featured man whose easy smile contrasts with his iron-dark eyes. He and his wife, Catherine, an amateur sculptor who accompanies her husband on most of his trips to China, have two grown daughters: Helene is a theatrical costume designer with her own business; Diane is curator of modern art at the Santa Barbara Museum of Fine Arts. The couple live in an eight-room Park Avenue apartment, and Mr. Shamash walks from there to his office on West 39th Street at the edge of Manhattan's garment district.\nOn weekends the Shamashes retreat to a house in East Hampton, L.I., and he spends much of his time deep-sea fishing.\nWhen not in China, New York or East Hampton, he is likely to turn up in Washington. He has lobbied persistently over the years, urging trade specialists at the Commerce Department to lower American barriers to trade with China.\nAlthough China now enjoys a small surplus in the $6 billion total trade with the United States, Mr. Shamash believes the balance will shift. ''China is in a state of transformation and badly needs the manufacturing know-how and sophisticated products of the United States, '' he explained, predicting a ''logarithmic'' growth of trade between the two countries."}, {"text": "TO AFGHAN REBELS, MEDICS ARE BLESSED FROM AFAR\n1985-07-23T05:00:00.000Z\nIt took three hours to remove a three-and-a-half-pound tumor from the right leg of a 4-year-old boy as he lay on a cloth on the ground, sedated with an anesthetic that is elsewhere generally used on animals.\nThere were no hospital gowns and no one watching dials for vital signs, just a few small trays of instruments on the cloth next to the boy.\nWhen the last stitch was tied, the doctor performing the operation, Paul Ickx, a volunteer with Doctors Without Borders, a Paris-based organization, slowly stood up to his full 6 feet. He removed his gloves, washed and walked to a nearby building that he shares with the three nurses on the staff.\nThe doctor, 31 years old, has cropped black hair, small metal-rimmed glasses and a drooping mustache.\nAsked if he was in Afghanistan because of idealism, he replied: ''Idealism? I believe everyone has a right to medical treatment.'' #8-Month Volunteer Tours The three nurses working with Dr. Ickx - Rudy Senaeve, Beatrice Fraiteur and Marie Basuyan - are also volunteers in Afghanistan with Doctors Without Borders. All are serving eight-month assignments in Afghanistan, for which they receive an honorarium of about $300 a month to help them re-establish themselves when they return home.\nDr. Ickx, Mr. Senaeve and Miss Fraiteur are Belgian; Miss Basuyan is French. To the Afghans, they are all ''the French doctors.''\nDr. Ickx, asked if his tour of duty was a political statement, said: ''Of course. We are always on a side that is the weakest, and usually against the Government.\n''But political in the sense that I am anti-Russian?'' he said. ''No. In fact, I volunteered to work with the rebels in El Salvador but something happened at the last minute. I was asked to return to Afghanistan, where I had been before, to save this hospital, which would have been closed.''\nThe hospital, at Zari, about 90 miles south of the Soviet border and 20 miles south of the district center at Shulgara, is the only medical center in rebel-held territory for hundreds of miles.\nA 46-Day Journey\nIt took 46 days to reach the area from Pakistan, Dr. Ickx said, on a journey that began in mid-November 1984. The first 35 days, he said, were spent in a convoy of trucks carrying arms and ammunition from Pakistan. On any given day, four of the six aged American or captured Russian trucks broke down on the rutted roads, Dr. Ickx said. There were further delays when the convoy passed through an area where fighting was raging between traditional Shiite Moslem groups and revolutionary forces who follow the ideology of the Iranian leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.\nAfter that, the doctor said, the road was blocked by snow. No pack animals could be bought, so the team had to travel 11 days on foot, leaving medical supplies behind. The group neared its destination just as the Russians unleashed an offensive, capturing Zari and holding it for 10 days, the doctor said.\nFor safety, the team had to spend months in the Tunj Valley, protected by high canyon walls, a four-hour walk from Zari. The team worked on military and civilian patients coming in from the battle area. Their only medical supplies were those left over from the team they had come to relieve.\nWarning Scrawled on Wall\nIt was only almost six months after they left Pakistan that they were allowed to establish themselves at Zari, the doctor said. Scratched on a wall of one of the two buildings they would occupy they found these words: ''Foreign doctors. We know you are here. This is your unlucky day.''\n''Sure, sometimes you ask yourself, 'Why am I here?' '' Dr. Ickx said. ''But for us there are enough sick people in one day to provide the answer. I am not running away from anything in Belgium. People who are escaping cannot do a good job in the third world. You have to know how to adjust.\n''I like this country and its people,'' he said, adding that he can speak the Persian dialect that is the lingua franca of northern Afghanistan. ''I can get to know them well.''\nMr. Senaeve, a 27-year-old X-ray technician now serving as a nurse, said, ''The biggest part for me is adventure.'' The Doctors Without Borders teams in Afghanistan are always balanced with men and women as a means of dealing with the rigid sex divisions of Afghan culture.\nMr. Senaeve said he had learned some of the songs of the Afghan resistance and played the melodies on a five-hole wooden pipe. He had suffered a slight fracture of his right arm in a fall from a horse and was working with his arm in a cast and sling.\n''There is idealism, too,'' he said. ''There is an over-consumption of medicine in Europe. It is a business. I like to travel, but if I go as a tourist I only collect postcards. I want to live with the people and learn from them. It's a mixture of doing a job and making it interesting.''\nSeveral Overseas Tours\nMiss Fraiteur, also 27, is already an experienced international medical worker. In 1979, she went to Thailand to help with a wave of refugees from Cambodia, and then to Bangladesh and Somalia. Last year, she was with Dr. Ickx and Mr. Senaeve at a hospital, since closed, in the Hazarajat mountains of central Afghanistan.\nA Belgian reporter interviewed her there, wrote a glowing story about her and later nominated her as ''Woman of the Year'' in a contest sponsored by Belgian newspapers, she said.\nShe won, and returned home in May 1984 to find herself greeted with roses and television cameras. She was also invited to three meetings with King Baudouin of Belgium.\n''This has been my hardest assignment,'' she said, ''particularly the four months in the hidden valley of Tunj. We were shut off completely from the world. We did not know how the war was going. We only saw the casualties. We had only one room to live and work in. If we had to do an operation we had to persuade a villager to give us a room to work in.''\nShe echoed Dr. Ickx's remarks about the need to know how to adjust to the fierce individuality of the Afghans. ''In Africa, you live in a white ghetto,'' she said. ''In Asia you are something special, 'Dr. So-and-so' or 'Miss So-and-So, our nurse.' You have all the comforts it is possible for them to give.\n''But here you are not even a Moslem and maybe only a woman,'' she said. ''You have to eat their food and live as they live. And when you ask for something you must explain why you want it, not just say that you want it.''\nThe Battle for a Door\nWhen the team arrived, a door was missing from the one-room building where all four live together, using water from a nearby irrigation canal to drink and for baths. It took constant nagging for six weeks, they said, to have a door made; all the while, Afghans wandered in to sit and stare at them. They said a table for operations was still in the stage of promises of ''maybe next week.'\nMiss Basuyan, the fourth member of the team, served previously in Thailand and came to Afghanistan because, she said, she wanted to learn something about Moslems.\nWhat had she learned? ''For a woman, life is hard,'' she said. ''She must always go about with her face covered and never talk to a man who is not of her family.\n''But that's why we are needed here,'' she said. ''The women are pleased to see us and give us presents of eggs or fruit and sometimes beautifully embroidered pieces of cloth. The men never think of giving anything.''\nThere are about 200 patients a day, about equally divided between men and women, group members said. The patients, they said, begin to arrive at 6 A.M., although the hospital does not open until 8:30 except in emergencies; a man with a gun sits at the barrier before the hospital to maintain order.\nMany patients complain of vague aches or pains in the chest, head or legs. They are, the group members said, looking for a magic remedy. They go away with a few pills.\nOthers are seriously ill with malaria, bone diseases and lung or eye infections. The most that can be be done is to give them simple medicines. The patients themselves do not want to stay for longer treatment. A rebel fighter with a serious knee injury from a kick by a horse received emergency care and was taken away on a horse by his friends.\nFew Become Inpatients\nAt any time, there are only four or five inpatients. A woman and child with broken bones and shell fragments in their arms and legs were operated on and put in casts, then stayed for several weeks, the group said. A young fighter who stepped on a mine had a foot amputated and a bone fracture, too. He stayed until the cast was removed. Dr. Ickx said he was proudest of the medical attention he was able to give to a young man who was struck in the head by a bullet. The delicate operation, the doctor said, went on for hours.\nBut, Dr. Ickx said, the man recovered and sometimes returned to the hospital for a visit; apparently the only permanent damage was that the patient lost peripheral vision on both sides.\n''This,'' he said, ''is why we are here. We help people who would have died.''"}, {"text": "How to Buy an Ounce of Food-Shortage Prevention\n1985-06-04T05:00:00.000Z\nTo the Editor:\nWith thousands missing and feared dead from floods in Bangladesh, and thousands of lives being lost daily because of starvation in Africa, the United States can ill afford to turn its back on third-world countries that are experiencing food shortages.

JOHNSON Staff Associate, Bread for the World Washington, May 28, 1985"}, {"text": "THE PUNJAB: TORN BY TERROR\n1985-09-08T05:00:00.000Z\nLATE IN THE AFTERNOON ON TUESDAY, AUG. 20, HAR-chand Singh Longowal walked into a Sikh temple near Sangrur, his home village in the heart of the Punjab, to offer prayers for peace. Longowal, president of the Sikhs' major political party, the Akali Dal, had spent the earlier part of the day in the state capital of Chandigarh, where he conferred with party colleagues on how to contest state and parliamentary elections that Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had ordered for late September.\nThe elections were intended to restore political normalcy in a state where, for the last four years, confrontations between Government security forces and militant Sikh separatists have fostered an atmosphere of growing tension, uncertainty and violence. On July 24, Longowal had signed a historic accord with Prime Minister Gandhi under which the Indian Government conceded a number of longstanding Sikh demands concerning regional autonomy. In return, Longowal committed himself to finding a peaceful solution to the Punjab's problems within the framework of the Indian Constitution.\nLongowal, a 54-year-old man with a long beard and a gentle face, bowed before the Granth Sahib, Sikhism's bible, and began speaking to the mostly Sikh congregation, urging reconciliation between Sikhs and Hindus.\nSuddenly, a Sikh youth seated in front of Longowal pulled out a pistol and started firing. The assailant was grabbed by a teen-age boy next to him, and the bullets intended for Longowal killed the boy instead. In the confusion, another Sikh man -whom many took to be one of Longowal's bodyguards -rushed toward the Sikh leader, shouting for order and urging the congregation to remain calm. But this man then spun around and pumped several shots into Longowal. The Sikh leader died minutes later at a nearby hospital.\nThe assassination was the latest episode in a cycle of worsening violence centered around demands by radical Sikhs that they be permitted to establish their own theocratic nation, called Khalistan. After launching a wave of bloody terrorist attacks against Hindus and moderate Sikhs in the Punjab, militant separatists in 1983 began fortifying one of Sikhism's holiest shrines - the Golden Temple of Amritsar. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi responded by ordering the Indian Army to storm the temple on June 5-6, 1984, sparking a fierce battle in which as many as 2,000 people are thought to have died. Sikh radicals struck back on Oct. 31, when Indira Gandhi herself was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards. That attack in turn set off a weeklong nightmare of communal violence across northern India in which thousands of innocent Sikhs were slaughtered by vengeful Hindu mobs. In June, an Air India 747 jetliner was blown out of the sky off the Irish coast, all 329 passengers aboard killed. Although the cause of the crash has not been determined, there was widespread speculation that it was caused by a bomb planted by Sikh terrorists.\nMany Indians fear that, by removing the one moderate Sikh leader courageous enough to conclude an agreement of reconciliation with the Indian Government, Longowal's assassination may provoke a still deeper crisis for the trouble-torn Punjab and for India's Sikh population, which includes 14 million of India's 800 million people. Longowal had begun to create a middle ground where Sikhs could reconcile their political differences and begin to deal collectively with an Indian Government that many Sikhs feel continues to be insensitive to their community. Even more important, he had attempted to reach beyond politics alone to urge a broader reconciliation between Hindus and Sikhs. For that reason, his death was not only a blow to peace in the Punjab, but also a setback to a deeper healing of communal differences throughout the country. And it must be seen as a warning to any other moderate leader who attempts to speak out against terrorism and find a peaceful solution to the current crisis.\nN OT SO LONG AGO, the Sikhs were pampered by Hindus, whom they had traditionally served as soldiers and military experts. Born out of Hinduism in the 15th century, Sikhism was founded by Guru Nanak (1469-1539), who claimed to have experienced mystical revelations.\nAccording to the eminent Sikh historian and writer Khushwant Singh, Nanak may have initially intended only to encourage reform of Hinduism, ''but as his message caught on with the masses, he decided to give his teachings permanency through a sect of his own.'' His followers were called Sikhs - the Punjabi word for ''disciple.'' They did not chant Sanskrit hymns, as Hindus did, but sang devotional songs that Nanak had composed in his native language, Punjabi.\nThe Sikhs were seen as the militant arm of Hinduism. They fought not only against the Moslems who ruled India at the time, but also against Persian, Afghan and Pathan invaders. In keeping with this martial tradition, Sikh gurus directed male Sikhs not to cut their hair and beards, to append the name ''Singh'' -which means ''lion'' - to their first names, and to always carry a kirpan, or dagger.\nThe antagonisms between the Sikhs and Hindus began to emerge under the British, who inducted Sikhs into the army in large numbers and used Sikh troops to keep rebellious Hindu chieftains under control. The first calls for a sovereign Sikh nation were issued in the mid-1940s, in the ferment that accompanied Indian independence. When partition came in 1947, and Pakistan was carved out of India, the Sikhs of the Punjab were the biggest losers. The choicest farmland of the state was in its western region, where the British had built a network of irrigation canals, and this area was given to Pakistan.\nSikh resentments were deepened by the announcement that new Indian states were to be fashioned largely along linguistic lines. Under the plan, 13 of India's 15 major indigenous languages thus found a formal home within the boundaries of a new state, but the Punjabi language remained unrepresented. The battle over language in effect became a confrontation between Punjabi Hindus and Punjabi Sikhs, leading to the Government's decision in 1966 to split the Punjab into three states. The Sikhs got their Punjabi-speaking state, but its land area was sharply reduced.\nThe new Punjab state thrived economically, largely because of ''green revolution'' advances that dramatically improved agricultural yields, allowing it to become India's largest food-producing region. In addition, the Punjab began exporting labor; educated Sikhs as well as semiliterate craftsmen went to the West and to the oil-rich states of the Persian Gulf to work - and soon were repatriating more than $2 billion annually to their relatives. This money stimulated economic development throughout the Punjab. You could now buy not only electronic goods but also fancy foodstuffs, textiles, home appliances and furniture almost anywhere in the state. In contrast to the poverty visible elsewhere in India, it was rare to see a hungry Punjabi, and rarer still to see a destitute one.\nT HE PUNJAB'S ECO-nomic progress reached a plateau, however, in the mid-1970s, as agricultural yields began to stabilize and declining oil prices weakened the market for guest workers in the Persian Gulf. At about the same time, Sikhism's elders discovered to their dismay that the religion's hold over the young was slipping as non-Sikh ways of living were imported into the state. More specifically, they felt that Sikhism in the Punjab was being irrevocably undermined by Hindu influences. The annual influx of more than 200,000 low-caste Hindu farm workers created social tensions. Many of these migrant workers stayed on and enrolled as voters - thus fattening the percentage of Hindus in the state. Sikh clergymen felt that their religion was under siege.\nAs the proportion of Sikhs in the Punjab was declining, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's ruling Congress Party in Delhi accelerated its involvement in Punjab politics in an attempt to prevent the political ascendency of the main Sikh party, the Akali Dal.\nThe Akalis argued that the central Government in Delhi should restrict its functions in the Punjab to defense, foreign affairs, communications and currency. They eventually went even further, taking the position that the Sikh religion was ''not safe without sovereignty,'' although they stopped short of formally calling for a separate state.\nThe fervor of Sikh separatists was fueled and financed by wealthy Sikhs living abroad. One of these men was a London-based physician named Jagjit Singh Chohan, a former secretary-general of the Akali Dal and a former finance minister of the Punjab, who proclaimed himself ''president'' of Khalistan and even produced Khalistan passports, postage stamps and currency.\nThe fundamentalists began rallying around Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a fiery demagogue who had initially assisted Mrs. Gandhi and her Congress Party to undercut the Akalis, but then became convinced that a better strategy lay in advocating agitation against Punjab's Hindus and in aiming for Khalistan. He recruited men who shared his firebrand fundamentalism, launched a terrorist campaign to murder Punjab's Hindus and moderate Sikhs, and drew international attention to himself and his cause. His fortification of the Golden Temple was no secret, and Bhindranwale openly boasted that he conducted his terrorist campaign out of Sikhism's holiest shrine.\nAfter dithering for months about whether she should send her troops to flush Bhindranwale out of his sanctuary, Mrs. Gandhi finally authorized the military operation in June 1984. The Indians had not, apparently, taken into account the fact that hundreds of Sikh pilgrims had crowded into the Golden Temple's courtyard to commemorate the martyrdom of one of Sikhism's early gurus.\nScores of these pilgrims were killed during the army siege, along with hundreds of terrorists who put up fierce resistance against enormous odds. Among the dead was Bhindranwale, his body riddled by more than a dozen bullet holes. Estimates of fatalities run as high as 2,000 dead, although the Indian Government maintains that the figure was no more than 500.\nSikhs around the world were outraged by the attack. Some swore vengeance. On the morning of Oct. 31, Mrs. Gandhi was assassinated by two Sikh bodyguards in her garden in New Delhi. One of the guards was shot and killed while in custody. The other Sikh and two other alleged co-conspirators are currently on trial in New Delhi.\nIn the wake of the assassination, thousands of innocent Sikhs were killed by rampaging mobs in Delhi and other cities in northern India. In Delhi alone, according to Sikh leaders, up to 10,000 Sikhs were killed. The Indian Government puts the figure lower, but acknowledges that thousands were killed and injured.\nAs many as 100,000 survivors of this holocaust have since fled to the Punjab, and those who remain in places like Delhi are extremely bitter. Widows have received ''compensation'' of about $900 each, and accommodations in tenements in Delhi.\nIn mid-July, I visited one such tenement colony on the outskirts of Delhi. The colony is called Tilak Vihar, and roads around it are mostly unpaved. More than 200 Sikh widows have been given one-room quarters in a block of four-story apartment buildings. Some of the rooms have as many as a dozen occupants.\nOne elderly man I spoke with, Amir Singh, had been a scrapdealer in the Nangloi area of Delhi. Three of his four sons, and three of his nephews, were killed in the riots. His house was destroyed. At the age of 68, he must now provide for six widows and 14 grandchildren.\nSingh blamed the riots on local Congress Party workers, people with whom the Nangloi Sikhs had enjoyed cordial relations. Singh himself, in fact, had often lined up local Sikh votes for the Congress Party. ''Why were we made the victims?'' he asked, tears in his eyes. ''We earned our bread by our sweat. We were never political people. We always thought that the Khalistan business was nonsense. We always thought that India was our home.''\nHe pointed to the widows in his family. ''How can our bitterness be wiped away?'' he asked. ''It is too deep. The guilty must be punished, but we don't think it will happen.''\nOne of the widows, a young woman named Dhanwat Kaur, said her three little children had seen their father, a carpenter, burned alive by a Hindu mob. She and some other bereaved women in the Tilak Vihar colony have organized themselves into a cooperative to sew clothes. The local Sikh temple gives each family about $70 a month.\nOne evening in the Punjab near Amritsar, I listened to Amrik Singh, a young carpenter who had fled to the Punjab from his home in Delhi. He spoke before a small gathering of friends and relatives in a dhaaba, a roadside restaurant. In a low voice, he said he had lost his father, five brothers and two sons in the riots. They had been hacked to death, he said. His wife was raped while he was made to watch, his 7-year-old daughter was molested. He himself was repeatedly stabbed, almost castrated, and left for dead.\nHis audience seemed stunned as he spoke. It is not often that a Sikh male will vounteer information that his wife's honor has been violated. Women started weeping. Men began to shout in anger. In Alexandria, Va., I talked with Ganga Singh Dhillon, president of the World Sikh Organization and the leading lobbyist in the United States for Khalistan. Dhillon is suspected by many Indian officials of having links with an international Sikh terrorist movement to destabilize India - allegations that Dhillon stoutly denies.\nAlthough he had agitated for a more autonomous Punjabi state for many years, Dhillon says that his mind was made up about Khalistan only after last year's massacres. ''We are not looking for just a piece of land,'' the businessman said, ''we are looking for territory where Sikhs can protect their women and children, where a Sikh can become the master of his own destiny - where my religious shrines are not allowed to be run over by army tanks. You can call it an independent Punjab, a sovereign state, or Khalistan. What we are asking is for a homeland for the Sikh nation.''\n''We do not expect justice from Rajiv Gandhi and his people,'' Dhillon said. ''He will follow the same route as his late mother. And let me tell you this, the result will be the bloodshed of innocent men, women and children -and not only Sikhs but also of Hindus, and there will be the destruction of the present Government of India.''\nIncreasingly, this kind of Sikh militancy is met with similar extremism on the Hindu side. In the Punjab, there are many new Hindu militant groups, among them the Hindu Suraksh Samiti (Committee for the Protection of Hindus), the Hindu Brahmin Sabha (the Hindu Brahmin organization), and the Punjab Shiv Sena (the Army of Shiva in Punjab).\n''A wave of militant Hindu fanaticism is sweeping the Punjab today,'' says Rahul Singh, editor of the Chandigarh edition of the Indian Express, India's largest daily newspaper. In the industrial town of Jullundur, for example, a Hindu-owned newspaper, the Pratap, openly urges Hindus to teach Sikhs a lesson. Many local Hindus fear that if the central Government withdraws the army and special security forces from the Punjab, there will be a bloodbath. It is quite common these days to see stockpiles of weapons in Hindu homes.\nAnd it is not just Hindus in the Punjab who harbor ill will against Sikhs. Even in the Indian capital of Delhi, ordinarily a cosmopolitan city, I was astonished to find how many Hindus voiced the sentiment that Sikhs had it coming to them. ''They have been arrogant people,'' said Umanath Acharya, a textile merchant. ''These Sikhs have prospered off the fat of our land, yet they treated everyone else like dirt. Now that they have been properly humiliated, they beg for special treatment.''\nThis ''we versus them'' feeling is startlingly evident in many parts of India these days. In New Delhi, I spoke with Nandita Narain, a young professor of mathematics at a local college. Miss Narain, who helped assist Sikhs who had been attacked during the riots, expressed amazement at the attitudes of her fellow Hindus. ''People seem secretly happy that a lesson has been taught to the Sikhs,'' she said. ''Now I see the deep hurt among my Sikh students. They don't say much in the classroom. It's gone beyond words. They just sit there whenever any politics is discussed, with their faces flushed - but they say nothing. I think among Hindus the main problem these days is that they cannot put themselves into Sikhs' shoes.''\nThat was also a sentiment I encountered among Sikhs in the Punjab. ''Hindus need to reach out to Sikhs in brotherhood,'' said Maheep Singh, a professor of Hindi literature in Amritsar. ''For centuries Sikhs thought they enjoyed the confidence of the Hindu majority. But now they feel totally threatened by the very community from which they sprang. I think most Sikhs would like to forget the nightmares they were subjected to. But they want their honor and dignity back - nothing more, nothing less. What the Sikh moderate is saying is that this honor can be restored if the Gandhi Government and majority Hindus reach out in friendship to us. What the Sikh separatist is saying is that the honor can only be brought back to Sikhs through a separate, independent state.''\nS IKHS IN THE PUN-jab say they feel harassed and persecuted by the Indian Government, whose continuous presence is symbolized by the army and paramilitary forces stationed there. Government officials tend to dismiss such talk as hyperbole. A senior army official, who monitors the intelligence and security apparatus in the Punjab, said that many Sikhs and their leaders simply had abandoned reason. ''They have dropped their shutters,'' he said, wearily. ''They have imaginary fears, and their total distrust of the Indian Government is often based on wild rumors. They seem to have transferred guilt to the 'other side,' which is to say that nothing in the Punjab is ever their fault, that it is always us who are to be blamed.\n''And Sikhs abroad get excited by such wild charges here. These expatriates have maliciously internationalized the Punjab problem. The Sikhs abroad have seen how other small territories obtained independence - like Djibouti and Bangladesh -so now they feel they, too, have a chance.''\nThis official, who asked for anonymity, said what really worries him is the fact that more and more young Sikhs seem to be attracted to the terrorist cause, and to a state of fanaticism about their religion.\n''The continued repression in the Punjab has caused the majority of Sikhs to lose confidence in the Government,'' said Lieut. Gen. Jagjit Singh Aurora, a Sikh now retired from the military. ''A siege mentality has developed in the Punjab. The average Sikh hates all security forces here. The army used to be much loved in the state, because so many Sikhs went into it. You see, terrorists are made, not born. You cannot eliminate them by repressive means. The more you harass these young people, the more of them you lock up without fair trial, the more you torture them in jail - the more you will embitter them.''\nAccording to Parkash Singh Badal, the former chief minister of the Punjab and leader of the Akali Dal, Sikhs see themselves as being in a continuing conflict with the Indian state - in the name of ''terrorism'' all Sikhs are being persecuted. Badal said that ''all ordinary Sikhs are having to pay the price'' of the Government's clash with the terrorists.\nOne evening in Chandigarh, I saw what Badal was talking about. I had been invited to dinner at the home of a businessman, Shivinder Singh. Shortly before the food was served, several policemen arrived at the door, demanding that my host surrender the keys to his jeep - an olive-green vehicle that they contended could be used by terrorists posing as security men. Shivinder protested that he used the jeep only for hunting trips, but the police, not interested in explanations, took his keys and left.\nIn defense of such measures, Hindus note that few Sikhs voiced outrage when Bhindranwale's thugs were murdering Hindus all across the Punjab, and they ask why moderate Sikhs do not speak out more forcefully against terrorist outbursts that continue to afflict the state.\nSikhs, however, reject such arguments as self-serving. ''Why should I speak out?'' said Noni Chawla, a young, affluent Sikh, his voice quivering with rage. ''Under the best of circumstances, my existence as a Sikh is in jeopardy. I am suspect in my own country. So why should I speak out and put myself on someone's hit list?''\nAccording to Sukhinder and Kunal Singh, a youthful Sikh couple who run a business in the Punjab, even longtime friends avoid discussing Punjab politics.\n''People know that any reference to the Punjab question touches off violent arguments,'' said Kunal. ''What sort of a place has this become? I used to be the greatest ambassador for India. But now we Sikhs are being suspected at every turn.''\nT HE TENSION AND mistrust that now reign in the Punjab are all the more saddening because they are frequently juxtaposed with glimpses of extraordinary beauty and tolerance, as I found, ironically, in a visit to the Golden Temple in Amritsar - only days after Indira Gandhi's assassination and the subsequent riots. I was taken into the temple by a Sikh friend, Bhagwant Singh Ahuja, a tall, stocky man who insisted that we worship together at Sikhism's holiest shrine.\nThe bazaars near the Golden Temple were packed with people this Sunday morning, and we parked outside one of the four main gates: Ahuja's station wagon had to be squeezed between a vendor of oranges and a man who had set up a stall of spicy savories. We checked our shoes at a booth near the entrance, and Ahuja rented for me a patka, or sort of a cap to cover my head - everyone's head must be covered inside the temple.\nWe washed our feet in a small basin and then walked down a flight of marble steps into the courtyard of the Golden Temple. The Harimandir Sahib shrine sparkled in the brilliant sunshine. The sacred pool in which it sat was lightly ruffled by a cool breeze. I looked around. I was the only non-Sikh male in the vast courtyard. The temple's public-address system was broadcasting hymns in the Punjabi language that were being sung inside the Harimandir by granthis, or acolytes.\nAhuja and I walked on the marble-floored perimeter, known as the Parikrama. We occasionally weaved through columns and under doorways. Ahuja kept very close to me. I thought this was a gesture of protection - this Sikh wants to make sure that his Hindu companion comes to no harm. If I was being bold by turning up inside Sikhism's holiest shrine even as Sikhs were being butchered not far away in Delhi, then Bhagwant Singh Ahuja was even more courageous in escorting a Hindu to such a place. Several Sikhs stared at us as we walked by.\nAhuja stopped at times at a ghat, or steps that led into the sacred pool, and sipped holy water: I replicated his motions. The water was cool, even sweet. Ahuja paused to bow before an ancient tree in whose shadow a Sikh saint, long dead, once lived and preached.\n''Look around you; look carefully,'' he said. I was startled by what I saw. Abutting the Parikrama were mounds of rubble. Marble flooring had caved in. Many buildings were pockmarked by bullet holes. The sunburst of shells marred several structures. Even the Akal Takht shrine, Bhindranwale's stronghold, which had been restored by the Indian Government at the cost of $40 million since the June battle, somehow looked hastily patched up.\nThe man in direct command of the military assault was himself a Sikh - Lieut. Gen. Ranjit Singh Dayal, chief of staff of the army's prestigious western command. General Dayal's main adversary was another highly decorated Sikh war hero, Maj. Gen. Shabeg Singh. Shabeg Singh had been cashiered from the Indian Army on corruption charges, and was recruited by Bhindranwale to train his growing band of terrorists. It was he who had trained Bhindranwale's motley band of militants in the use of highly sophisticated weapons such as antitank cannons. Looking at the temple on this lovely November morning, it seemed inconceivable to me that anyone had dared to defile its serenity and sanctity.\nI followed Ahuja in cir-cumambulating the inner shrine, then I knelt in front of the Granth Sahib, and placed my forehead against the floor. A hand touched my head. I looked up into the gentle smile of an old man. It was a Sikh priest, blessing me.\nT HE SIKH RADICALS who killed Longowal may have aimed their pistols at the Akali leader -but their real target was the accord he had signed with the Prime Minister. It is a tribute to Gandhi's own determination to restore democratic processes to the Punjab that he did not scuttle the elections. The poll was postponed by only three days, to Sept. 25, although there are some influential Congress and Akali officials who have urged that the elections be further delayed. Prof. Rajni Kothari, an eminent political analyst, notes that Longowal himself had argued that more time was needed to gain support for the accord itself.\nThe key issue in the elections is the future role of Sikhs in the Punjab government. For two years, the local government has been suspended and the Punjab has been under direct rule from New Delhi. Many Indians - both Sikhs and Hindus - believe that only a popularly elected state government can resolve the Punjab's dilemmas - including the paramount problem of terrorism.\nEven if Gandhi's Congress Party wins the elections, many Indians I spoke with feel the Akalis should be brought into the state government in some fashion. Longowal's death has left the Akalis without a leader of comparable stature, and there is already squabbling and disagreement among his associates over leadership positions. But despite such problems, most observers agree that the Akali Dal -and not Gandhi's Congress Party - enjoys the strongest grass-roots support among Sikhs, and that it alone has the credibility necessary to head off a new surge in separatist violence. Although Congress Party loyalists may be troubled by the prospect of an Akali administration in the state, Gandhi must bear in mind that, in a broader sense, a hard-fought partisan campaign might win the election but lose the Punjab.\nIt was Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's refusal to accept this fact, and her decision to impose an unpopular Congress Party regime on the state through political intimidation and interference, that sparked the current unrest.\nAvoiding his mother's mistakes will be a test of Rajiv Gandhi's political skills. If he succeeds, he may have the opportunity to put the Punjab on the road of lasting peace -and to bring a healing hand to the Sikh and Hindu communities. If he fails, the price is likely to be high."}, {"text": "POLISH ECHOES AND IRONIES\n1985-08-25T05:00:00.000Z\nIN FEBRUARY OF 1935, MY FATHER, ADAM Kaufman, jumped bail, and carrying skis he did not know how to use, he slid and stumbled from his native Poland into temporary sanctuary in Czechoslovakia.\nThis summer, after 50 years, my 82-year-old father came back, to visit me in Warsaw.\nIn the half century of his absence, Poland's borders have shifted some 200 miles to the west; my father's nationality, the Jews of Poland, have been killed or have fled; and though, in his day it was Communists who were hunted and imprisoned as dissidents, today a Communist government hunts and imprisons others. Yet, though the demographics have changed radically and the landscape has been altered by war and time, there is much in the conspiratorial and romantic culture of contemporary Poland that my father found movingly familiar. At the outset, I think I am obliged to declare myself. From an intimately subjective perspective, this story begins on a subway train in 1946, when my mother and father and I were returning home from visiting friends in Brooklyn. During the evening, my father had used the Polish verb ''to sit'' in a way I had never heard it used before. ''Yes, I sat with him,'' he had said, or, ''We sat there for two years.'' On the train home, I timidly asked him did that mean he had been in jail. Very gently, he said yes, that in another time, in another place, he had been a Communist revolutionary and that he had spent nine and a half years in jail between the time he was 22 and 33 years old.\nI was then 8, and I regularly listened to the radio program ''Gangbusters.'' I believed that bad people went to prison and good people put them there, and here was the best man I knew, a man who had saved me from occupied France and the furnaces of war, and he had been imprisoned many times. In that instant, I think, I received my Polish patrimony, which in large measure includes an awareness that in this world the good often go to prison.\nThere is a Polish poet, Tomasz Jastrun, a man who is close to the outlawed Solidarity movement and who is also the son of a fine poet of Poland's wartime resistance. Not long ago, he wrote a short poem called ''The Chain,'' which included these lines: His grandfather sat For Poland Which did not exist His father sat For Poland Which arose Now he sits For Poland Which no longer exists Over the years, after that moment on the train, I came to know many of the details of my father's early life. Once, when he was 70 and I was 35, he gave me a 100-page typescript spelling out as dispassionately as he could the details of what he did and thought in the years before I was born, in 1938. As I prepared to welcome him to Warsaw, I reread this account of trials, interrogations, betrayals, hunger strikes, suicide attempts and illicit flights across borders. What had seemed distantly romantic and dated when I first read it in New York felt almost contemporary amid today's Polish realities.\nNow, my father often scorns his youth as naively misguided, and for almost five decades he has been an intensely private man. He has allowed me to write about his visit to Poland only with great reluctance, once again indulging his only child.\nFROM THE VERY first hours of my father's recent monthlong visit, both of us were absorbed by often uncanny symmetries and striking ironic twists. Just after he arrived, I had to go to Gdansk to cover the trial of Adam Michnik and two other Solidarity activists, who were subsequently sentenced to prison for having advocated a 15-minute general strike to protest price increases. When I returned, my father asked me what the specific charges had been, and when I told him, he replied, ''In my day, it was paragraph 102.'' He recited from memory: ''Membership in an illegal organization that has as its aim to abolish most of the existing social order.'' He added, ''Then it meant Communists, now it means Solidarity.''\nThere was more symmetry. The last time my father had been charged under that law was when he stood trial with 19 other men, among them Mr. Michnik's late father, Ozjasz Szechter. That trial was held in Lvov, then a Polish, now a Russian city, in 1929. All the defendants were members of the Communist Party of the Western Ukraine, an autonomous part of the Communist Party for the Polish provinces with a large Ukrainian population, which my father, then 27 years old, headed as secretary. He was the principal defendant in that trial and he eventually drew the longest sentence, four years.\nAs he prepared for his return to Poland, my father had very much wanted to meet Mr. Michnik, the 38-year-old son of his old colleague, who uses his mother's name. He very much admires Mr. Michnik's antitotalitarian essays, and he respects the political and humanistic activities of the man whom many in the Polish opposition consider to be their most articulate champion. Since Mr. Michnik's arrest last February, he has not been allowed to see visitors, but a few days after he was sentenced to two and a half years, the Polish historian's fiancee, Barbara Szwedowska, came to visit and spent a few hours with my father.\nHe greeted her with almost courtly respect. He told her that his wife, my mother, who died in New York five years ago, had once waited a total of eight years for him, and that her sacrifice, which had been for love, had turned out to be more fruitful than his own, which had been made in the name of dogma.\nMiss Szwedowska asked my father about his first impressions. He told her there were many, but that one struck him as particularly ironic. He said that when he was a young Communist organizer in the 1920's, people in Poland had many ways to explain and account for their unhappiness and dissatisfaction. ''There was a pluralism of blame,'' he said. ''A worker might blame the factory owner, some anti-Semites blamed wealthy Jews, Jews said the problem lay with anti-Semites, and the peasants resented wholesale merchants. Others pointed to Germans or Ukrainians as the source of trouble. Meanwhile, we Communists, a small group, ran around saying, no, it's not a question of individual grievances, it is the system that is to blame. Now, after 50 years, I come back and what do I see? The whole nation knows perfectly well that the problem lies with the system and only the leaders are saying, no, the difficulties are the fault of individuals, former leaders, mistaken politicians, or, as during the anti-Semitic purges of 1968, Jews.''\nMiss Szwedowska laughed. She then described for my father how she had nursed Mr. Michnik's father for the half year during which he was dying of cancer. At the time, his son was in jail awaiting a treason trial that was never held. She said that Mr. Szechter had some years earlier actively turned against Communism, and that he even participated in protest hunger strikes in the Catholic churches he had once regarded as bastions of obscurantism and repression and bigotry.\nMy father replied with his own 50-year-old recollections of her fiance's father, who, he said, had been one of his political enemies, siding with the most ardent pro-Muscovite faction within the party. There were constant arguments over tendencies and approaches that, my father said, he now finds absurd and ludicrous, like obscure points of medieval theology: ''All that remains important to me now are the people, and I remember Szechter best for teaching me a song called 'A Letter to Mother,' by the Russian poet Sergei Yesenin. It was at a time when almost no one else would talk to me.'' It turned out that, many years later, Szechter had also taught the song to Miss Szwedowska, and in my living room she and my father sang it together.\nMy father then told why he cherished Szechter for teaching him the words. It happened just after the Lvov trial. The state had sentenced him to four years, and then, as he began serving the term, the Polish Communist Party, which had dispatched him to work in the Ukrainian organization, expelled him for ''Polish patriotic abberations'' he had revealed in making his defense at the trial. The resolution expelling him specifically condemned him for having told the court of his service as a volunteer in Marshal Josef Pilsudski's victorious Polish Army in the Polish-Bolshevik war of 1920. He was also assailed for having favorably mentioned two ''bourgeois'' Polish authors and for addressing the court in Polish, which the resolution described as ''the language of the oppressor,'' instead of Ukrainian, ''the language of the oppressed.''\nIn retrospect, the expulsion from the party probably saved his life, because it spared him from being summoned to Moscow and eliminated when, a few years later, Stalin first purged and then dissolved the Polish party for its nationalistic taint. However, with years of his term left to serve, my father, a veteran of more than a decade of disciplined party life, fell into despair. He had been the leader of the prison commune, and now old friends and former acolytes turned away, scorning him as a pariah. He tried to kill himself, but was saved by prison doctors. After some time in isolation, he was placed in the same cell as Szechter.\n''We were political enemies, but he was human and kind and we did not talk too much about party matters,'' he recalled for Miss Szwedowska. ''He taught me the song, and I believe I indiscreetly told him how disillusioned I had been with the Soviet Union when I visited Moscow during the 1928 Comintern Congress.''\nMiss Szwedowska told my father that in the days and nights she talked to Mr. Szechter before his death he had told her that his first doubts about Communism had arisen in a cell in Brigidka prison, in Lvov, when he spoke with a man who had been in Moscow as a guest during the 1928 Comintern meeting, and she said that he must have meant my father. My father is very tough and he does not cry easily, but after she said that he sat still for long minutes, his eyes shining with emotion.\nBut not all the memories pricked by his Warsaw visit were flattering. Just after he arrived, my father asked me to take him to the area where he had lived when he was a poor university student, studying law. The street has been replaced by a park that runs along a riverside highway just below the Old Town so painstakingly rebuilt after the war. The area is near the tourist center of the capital, with horse-drawn carriages carrying visitors over quaint cobblestone streets. The sight stimulated old feelings of guilt. This is how my father described it in a journal:\n''We passed through streets with familiar names: Freta, Dluga and Koscielna, where I lived during my first year at Warsaw University. It was the winter of 1920 and I was very poor, permanently hungry. In spite of this, I was exhilarated. I ran to lectures and ran to the library writing down everything I could not understand. I went to Parliament and listened to debates and returned home at 10 or 11 at night. But even then the streets were full of people, selling, buying, talking, quarrelling. Who were these people? Intellectually, I knew that in the narrow, teeming streets of the Muranow district there were hundreds of thousands of very poor, very helpless, very weak and tired Jews, carrying out a desperate daily fight for the necessities of life. Emotionally, however, they were outside of my consciousness. Years later, when these people were among the millions who were gassed and had their bodies burned to ashes, I reproached myself that as a boy of 19 I had so little sympathy for my miserable neighbors and brothers and instead had joined the party of Polish industrial workers who didn't need my help.\n''I regretted this, and I felt humiliated, but with time the remorse settled into my subconscious. Then, after walking the streets of the Old Town, this old regret returned, evoking a sickening feeling, a mixture of nostalgia, mourning and pity that the 368,000 Jews of Warsaw have gone and that only the names on the streets remain the same.''\nHISTORY IS EVERY-where in Poland, and the often tragic past is unavoidable. Everywhere there are monuments to sacrifice, to suffering. Families visit cemeteries regularly and bus loads of schoolchildren come each day to the concentration camps of Auschwitz, Majdanek and Treblinka. In Warsaw alone, there are three former prisons that are now museums. The sense of national history is everywhere. It is as real as grandmothers, and often it boils down to genealogy and family stories.\nOn the day we went to Auschwitz, as we walked in the rain among the rows of barracks, my father seemed to be thinking of specific losses - his sister, my mother's sisters, his nephews and nieces and the friends of his youth who perished in Nazi camps. There is a long gravel road that leads to the crumbling crematorium. My father walks slowly and uses a cane, and I could see that pieces of gravel were cutting into his thinly soled shoes. I asked him if he wanted me to ask for permission to drive him. He said, ''No, this is the Via Dolorosa; it is supposed to hurt, and it is right that it is raining.''\nWe made our way to the end and stood in front of one of the crematoriums. The thoughts of family victims were replaced by barely comprehensible images of as many as 24,000 people a day, among them children too young for sins, passing to their deaths. We needed some ritual, some incantation, to ease and affirm awe. My father intoned Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead that he had last recited as a 14-year-old boy after his father's death. Something else was needed, but in the end neither of us could think of anything more appropriate than silence.\nLater that day, as he entered his impressions in his journal, my father wrote that ''the magnitude of the crimes was so enormous that they could be perceived only feebly through the display cases of symbolic remnants - the bales of shorn hair, the confiscated eyeglasses and the washbowls.'' Auschwitz, he wrote, was ''a factory operating in reverse, a factory that took the most complicated, sensitive and sophisticated creatures of nature and transformed them into dust and raw materials.''\nMore in hope than belief, my father cited Jean-Marie Cardinal Lustiger, the Jewish-born Archbishop of Paris, whose views he had been reading. The Cardinal, he recalled, had said that at Auschwitz absolute evil was unleashed on humanity for which God will yet answer with absolute good. The sense that at the heart of Polish history lies genealogy or family stories was again emphasized one afternoon when my father and I were vis-ited by Janusz and Joanna Onyszkiewicz. He is a mathematician at the University of Warsaw who was also the national press spokesman for Solidarity when the independent labor union movement was legal. Joanna is a tall, British-born architect, who also happens to be the granddaughter of Marshal Pilsudski, who ruled prewar Poland, first as an elected leader and then as a military dictator. She first came to Poland during the heady days of Solidarity's bloom, and when she decided to marry and live here she willingly surrendered her British citizenship.\nHer grandfather is today venerated widely with almost cultlike adoration. The 50th anniversary of his death earlier this year was marked in churches all over the country, and, though the Government pays little heed to his role, old copies of his out-of-print books are highly coveted and his whiskered image is seen in the photos and busts prominently displayed in many Polish living rooms.\nDuring my father's prison years, Pilsudski, of course, was his hated nemesis, the authoritarian leader with whose police, courts and prisons he had to contend. In those years he had, perhaps daily, scorned and cursed the marshal, and now, in an irony he was clearly enjoying, he was sharing lunch with Pilsudski's granddaughter, cooing with delight at the robust infant son she held in her lap.\n''You know, we called him a Fascist,'' he said of the marshal, ''but we did not know then what Fascism really was. No one could then imagine the totalitarian regimes of Hitler or Stalin and the horrors that lay ahead.'' He stopped short of praising the villain of his youth, but he later told me, ''I realize now that Pilsudski was really much better than what came later in Poland.''\nMr. Onyszkiewicz, who is active in the Warsaw University senate, was explaining over lunch how academic freedom is being threatened by a proposed law that, among other things, would require loyalty oaths for teachers. Once again, my father was reminded of an old experience. He recalled that his first arrest, on a charge of conspiracy, took place in April 1924, just a month before he was to have graduated with a law degree. He ended up spending three years in prison on the charge, but after his release, one of his old professors, whom he met casually, suggested that he return to his studies. A panel from the university senate asked him only whether he had ever received pay from a foreign power, and when he replied no, he was readmitted.\nMy father wondered whether a student jailed for Solidarity activism or for distributing underground publications could be treated this way today. In fact, there have been instances in Lodz and Poznan in which university teachers have been dismissed because of ties to Solidarity and, just recently, Bronislaw Geremek, a teacher of medieval history, was discharged from his position at the Academy of Sciences because of his Solidarity links and political views.\nIn our Warsaw conversations, my father several times recalled that in his day there had been brutal repressions. Once, in jail, he was forced to lie down with four other men in a tiny crawl space and kept near suffocation for 48 hours. He was on occasion beaten, and he had seen and heard others being tortured. He had friends who had been in Bereza Kartuzka, a prewar concentration camp for political prisoners, where conditions were very harsh. Still, in some ways, he thought, there may have been more tolerance then.\nFor one thing, political inmates were, by and large, kept together in prison. They had access to books, and they maintained study groups. Once, my father recalled, he was given permision to make a May Day speech to his fellow inmates. Furthermore, in contrast to the Gdansk trial, at which Mr. Michnik was kept muzzled by the judge, my father remembered how he and others would use the prisoners' dock as a political pulpit. At one of his trials, he was even complimented by the judge on his rhetorical skill.\nIF SUCH NICETIES ARE no longer observed, Polish society still reveals a fascination with imprisonment and rebellion. Practically every movie and literary work includes prison motifs. It is significant that the Polish word for ''conspirator'' does not have any negative connotations. In Polish historical experience, incarceration, banishment and exile have always enhanced the credibility and authority of the sufferers. And, as my father pointed out, the present Government of Poland may be the first group of leaders since the country was partitioned in 1795 who neither served in prisons nor fought in clandestine conspiracies. He mentioned this as we walked through the Citadel, Warsaw's old czarist fortress where the cell occupied by the young, socialist Pilsudski lies near one once tenanted by Feliks Dzierzhinski, the Pole who later founded the Soviet secret police. Other cells bear the names of men and women who shaped Poland's history.\nA few days later, we went to yet another old jail that is now a museum, one that my father had known well. We drove to Lodz, Poland's second-largest city, where we stopped first at the house at 17 Piotrkowska Street, where my father was born and where he lived his first 10 years. With great nostalgic joy, he pointed out the balcony where, according to family legend, his mother shielded him with her body when, during the failed revolution of 1905, he came out to watch Cossack troops firing from Schultz's textile factory across the street toward striking workers scattering in the courtyard below. He was very moved by the streets of his childhood, streets and houses that were clearly recognizable except that now, he said, they were much cleaner and populated by much better dressed and healthier looking people. The open sewers of his youth were gone.\nWe continued on to the Museum of the Revolutionary Movement, which is housed in the jail in which my father on three different occasions spent the better part of a year. A sign on the door said it was open to visitors, but a uniformed guard said we could not come in. A young Polish friend who came with us said, ''Of course, he's wearing a uniform, so he has to say no.''\nI came close to losing my temper and remarked that three times in this old man's life, when the building was a prison, he had not wanted to enter it but had been forced to, and now that it was an open museum he was being barred. A young official came down and invited us in. My father, noticing that we were the only visitors, concluded that the place was probably visited mostly by school groups and that the appearance of three people coming off the street must have astonished the staff. We tried to find the punishment cell where he had almost suffocated, but it was gone. Instead, there were display cases of clandestine periodicals with names such as ''The Worker,'' ''Struggle'' and ''Independence,'' all looking quite similar to the materials published clandestinely today by Solidarity groups. There were letters smuggled from jail, such as he had written, and there were photographs of illegal strikes.\nMy father was less moved by all this than he had been at his old house, but when, among the photographs of people he had known and worked with, he spotted the face of Jan Tenenbaum-Jelski, he gasped. ''Naturally, it doesn't mention that he was finished in the Soviet Union by Stalin,'' he said, pointing to the photo of the man who had been his mentor and model as a revolutionary. My father had often told me about Jelski, whom he still admires for his physical and moral courage. Once, in Wronki Prison, Jelski spent a year in an unheated cell, wearing only underwear, rather than accept prison clothes. Later, he escaped in handcuffs from a Warsaw trolley while being trans-ferred from one prison to another and made his way to Moscow, where my father visited him in 1928.\nHis memory touched by the photograph, my father recalled that last meeting: ''He told me that Stalin was going to murder all of us, and I remember his saying that it was better to sit and teach in Polish prisons than to vegetate in Soviet bureaucracy.''\nLater during our day in Lodz, after we had looked at buildings that my maternal grandfather had built, including the house where my mother was born, and as we were walking in the weedy, large Jewish cemetery, my father was grappling with his thoughts about Jelski and his past: ''He had great courage and character, but I now realize his intelligence was limited by his political faith and submission to party discipline.'' How could so many people have accepted such idiotic positions, he wondered, recalling particularly the time before World War II when the party line insisted that both ''Fascism'' and ''social democracy'' were equivalent sins.\nAs we looked fruitlessly for family stones, he was obviously sifting the past. ''I see now that it was inevitable that I became a Communist,'' he said. He went on, ''I was poor, Jewish and hungered for answers. The Russian Revolution took place during my adolescence, and Poland was reborn. I wanted desperately to enter into the wonderful romantic sweep of Polish history. One way would have been conversion to Catholicism, which for me was impossible. Another way was the party. It was inevitable, but still a moral mistake.''\nHe said that one of the things that delighted him on his visit was that paradoxically, even though Polish society had become more homogenous, perhaps in the aftermath of Solidarity's opposition to the Government, it had become more tolerant and open to eclectic influences. ''In my day, there really was not much contact between workers, intellectuals, Jews and Catholics.'' In theory, he said, ''such mixing was supposed to take place in party activity, but in practice, snobbish distinctions prevailed there too.''\nBACK IN WARSAW, MY father looked up a few old survivors from his political past. One afternoon in my home he talked to a man who had once denounced him in the days before the suicide attempt. After my father slashed his wrists, this same man - his name is really unimportant - demanded that my father write a self-criticism for having attempted to shame the party by trying to kill himself. According to some Polish historians, the man spent the war years in Lvov with the Soviet Army and party, and by some accounts he denied residence permits to Polish refugees fleeing to the east. My father's brother, who vanished after reaching Lvov in this period, may have been among those people. Now an old man with trembling hands, the visitor traded memories with my father over tea.\nWhen he left, I asked my father how, in light of what he knew about the man, he could have seen him and chatted with him without obvious rancor. ''Oh,'' he answered, ''you know those ancient fights now seem remote and absurd, and as for conduct during the war, who knows how any of us would have acted in his place? Those, I think, are all forgivable sins.''\nIt turned out that my father was somewhat more critical of our caller's contemporary behavior. ''You know what he told me?'' my father asked in wondrous dismay. ''He said proudly that his daughter had been close to Solidarity, and that he, himself, regularly attends party meetings to argue against anti-Semitic strains. Imagine that? Anti-Semitism is no longer a social problem in Poland because there are very few Jews. It is a fascinating historical problem, but this man has made it the prop on which he maintains his honor. He even told me, without shame, that the only thing that has kept him from receiving a Government decoration was his Jewish origin. I think he really would take it if offered. In this world, being an opportunist when no one forces you is at least difficult to understand and perhaps unpardonable.''\nThis confrontation contrasted dramatically with another meeting my father had with an old comrade. In this case with a woman who is dying, a woman who after the war served on the Central Committee of the reconstituted and ruling Polish Communist Party. In the years after his expulsion, when she had been a dedicated and energetic official, she had regarded my father as a hateful apostate. Then, as Solidarity bloomed and was suppressed, this woman - I don't use her name here to spare her family possible bother - sent back her party card, saying that after more than 60 years, she could no longer belong to a party that turned guns on workers.\nShe is lame and has a blood disease and, like my father, is hard of hearing, but she has the grace of self-awareness and truth. After a separation of six decades, across an eroding abyss of ideological differences, the two old people hugged each other in human solidarity. She confessed that until 1956 she had still believed in Stalin, noting that in the 50's, when she was relatively high up in official ranks, she did not know that people in Poland were being deported and killed for having participated in patriotic, but anti-Communist, wartime forces.\nShe told my father also that when a young woman close to Solidarity came to her to tape her recollections of the past she declined, saying that because of her past she did not deserve the confidence of readers.\nLike so much of what happened during my father's visit, the meetings with people from long ago were intensely emotional. But, for him, the most inspiring event turned out to be when we went to St. Stanislaw Kostka Church, in Warsaw, to visit the grave of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, the pro-Solidarity priest who was slain last fall by four secret policemen. This is how my father recorded the visit in his journal:\n''We went to the church at noon on a sunny Saturday. I was deeply touched by the faces and attitudes of the visitors. Solemn, spiritual young couples with small children. I thought it was a rare moment when an almost incidental crowd passes before a martyr's tomb and while facing the tragic destiny of the nation, becomes a part of the nation. The visit to the grave, on the day after my arrival, was a fine introduction to the mood and spirit of today's Poland.''\nIN ADDITION TO THE nostalgic visits and sentimental wanderings, my father, who in the United States had worked as an economist, tried to figure out whether the stalemated conflict between government and society could give rise to the creation of an economic no-man's land in which both government and the opposition could suspend hostilities to allow development. Specifically, he wondered if areas of needed development, such as computer research, could be removed and protected from ideological skirmishing in the interest of the whole nation. He asked everyone he could about this, including members of the opposition, writers, diplomats and a member of Parliament. Mr. Onyszkiewicz, the mathematician and former Solidarity spokesman, agreed with my father that unless computer research were allowed to flourish unfettered by either side in the tug-of-war, Poland could soon sink to third-world status. ''Absolutely,'' said Mr. Onyszkiewicz, ''we will become Bangladesh.''\nBut when my father asked what, then, prevented both sides in the conflict from establishing a no-fire zone, Mr. Onyszkiewicz replied that the relatively weak ruling authorities simply will not relinquish control over any sphere of activity, and the only computer scientists they will be able to recruit are those willing to work under the supervision of men chosen only for their loyalty: loyalty not even to any idea, but simply to other bureaucrats.\nAfter dozens of such conversations, my father became convinced that the divisions in Poland remain very wide and that no effective bridges are likely to span the abyss very soon. Still, when he left, he was optimistic about the chances of the nation, which he so clearly still loves, despite early wounds, despite all the killing grounds, despite all the years away.\nIn the notes he left behind, he offered me these conclusions: ''In this unusual culture clash between the rulers and society, society is far from being defeated. The traditional ideology of the leaders is dead and they have no other to replace it. Even though the opposition does not yet speak with one language, it is articulating its challenges to authority, chipping away at the fetishes of a fossilized belief system. It seems to me that in Poland, moral problems and the problems of conscience are playing a much greater role in the everyday life of the average person than in any other contemporary society. It also seems to me that for millions of Poles, the future of their country, its culture, customs and well-being are private concerns. In this setting, 'Let Poland be Polish' is not simply some kind of agitprop slogan but a moral imperative and a personal commandment that allows Poles to preserve their dignity, decency and pride. Quite simply, they are working out the problems that will probably concern us all in the coming century - how to be human in a world of increasingly bureaucratic relationships.''\nI do not entirely agree with my father's assessment. He may, like so many Poles, be a little too romantic. Still, it is good to hear optimism from an 82-year-old man. It was more than good to be with him for this month and visit places, uncover feelings and respectfully acknowledge a past made intimate.\nWar, uprisings and other turmoil mark Poland's modern history. 1918 On Nov. 11, the Polish state is reborn, 123 years after its division among Germany, Russia and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. 1920-21 Invading Bolshevik armies defeated by Polish forces under Marshal Josef Pilsudski, who dominates politics between the World Wars. 1939 World War II begins Aug. 31, as Germans invade Poland; Soviet forces enter on Sept. 17. 1941 Nazis implement ''Final Solution'' in death camps in Poland. 1944-47 Liberation.
