    "text": "The World Needs a Strengthened Disaster Agency\n1999-11-09T05:00:00.000Z\nDeath, disaster and dispute in India again underline the need for a streamlined but neutral global organization to combine early warning with rescue and relief. Such a body must combat the suspiciousness of those who need help and the indifference of those who can give it.\nIndia is not alone in fighting shy of international assistance in the face of tragedy like the two massive cyclones that tore in from the Bay of Bengal at the end of October to ravage the coastal state of Orissa. But Russia and China, which were even more isolationist, are now extending globalization to the humanitarian field, too.\nThe pride, prejudice and politics of relief seem insane in Orissa, where the smoke billows up from hundreds of bonfires of human and animal corpses thrown together on beds of burning tires, while survivors scavenge for food and water.\nVillage after village has been washed away, crops and houses are flooded, cholera stalks the land. \"The proliferation of epidemics could become a major threat,\" warns Colonel Bikram Singh, who has 5,000 soldiers toiling around the clock to save the living as navy helicopters drop packets of rice and vegetables from the air.\nIt was for just such emergencies that the office of the United Nations disaster relief coordinator, UNDRO, was set up 28 years ago to mobilize, direct and coordinate the activities of various UN organizations \"in response to a request for disaster assistance from a stricken state.\"\nBut the world's rich see little dividend in alleviating distress. UNDRO remains chronically underfunded.\nRecipients are equally lukewarm. Some see international help as a slur on themselves; others are wary of foreigners. Flood-ravaged Bangladesh once sent back Indian relief helicopters. China in the past rejected national disaster assistance from Taiwan.\nTrue, foreign help can be a mixed blessing. Even UNDRO has warned that \"the impulsive generosity of governments, organizations and individuals alike can cause as much chaos and confusion as the disaster itself.\"\nAid can be trivial and insulting, as when neckties and swimsuits were sent to Indian earthquake victims. Well-meaning donors sometimes give the wrong drugs, or too much of the right one. They send heavy woollies to the steaming tropics, beef for vegetarians, food when cash is needed, and surgeons to countries with a surfeit of doctors.\nSelf-reliance is the best solution, as the Chinese proved in 1975 when they successfully evacuated Haicheng town only a few hours before a mighty earthquake devastated it. But not all countries are as resourceful. Some 131,000 people died victims of Bangladesh's 1991 cyclone.\nAbout 85 percent of the deaths from natural hazards occur in the Asia-Pacific region; 95 percent are caused by earthquakes, typhoons or floods; nine of the world's 10 most disaster-prone countries are in Asia. The Philippines, India and China head the list. Some 20 major natural disasters kill an average of 83,000 Asians every year, and destroy property and crops worth $4 billion\nThere are some signs of changing attitudes. India welcomed Western organizations during the 1971 influx of 9 million Bangladesh refugees. China not only accepted foreign help after the 1988 earthquake but also, when floods occurred some months later, allowed Taiwan to give $100,000. And six years ago the United Nations helped India during a major earthquake.\nBut many Third World countries still prefer money to manpower.\nOutsiders can do little about the bitter row that has erupted between Orissa's chief minister, Giridhar Gamang, and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee over money and monitoring for the cyclone relief program. Mr. Gamang demands nearly $1.3 billion without any supervision from the central government, which has allocated just $25 million\nUNDRO cannot eliminate the cruel acts of nature. But damage might be contained if it became the nucleus of a permanent agency, and were given the money and organization to follow up warnings with active programs carried out by a rapid deployment force.\nThe poor do not look succor down the mouth. Only governments do that. With the entire UN system under strain, rich nations may give even less if poor countries remain so selective.\nOrissa's suffering is a poignant reminder that globalization should not mean gunboat democracy or instant human rights, but a positive answer to what Malthus called \"the perpetual struggle for room and food.\"\nThe writer, a former editor of The Statesman in India, contributed this comment to the International Herald Tribune.",

    "text": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; A Day in the Life of a Trade Diplomat\n1999-10-28T05:00:00.000Z\nWhile his driver is weaving through traffic to get him to the office, Iftekhar Chowdhury's day begins, as nearly all do, trying to insure that the economically struggling Bangladesh partakes in the fruits of globalization.\nArriving one recent morning at the downtown building here that houses his country's plainly furnished office suite, Mr. Chowdhury confronts the mail that has accumulated overnight. Some are faxes from Bangladesh, half a world away. Others are notices of meetings and letters from international agencies, most bearing United Nations abbreviations or acronyms.\nThe 53-year-old career diplomat, officially his country's representative to United Nations agencies in Geneva, reels off these overnight communications in order of priority: the World Trade Organization, the United Nations Commission on Trade and Development, the World Intellectual Property Organization, the International Labor Organization -- and the list goes on.\nRomantic notions about the life of a diplomat notwithstanding -- especially in expensive, affluent cities like Geneva -- Mr. Chowdhury's grinding daily schedule is probably much closer to the truth. To him, Geneva is a working garden of international resources and contacts that he must constantly cultivate. His calendar is crammed with meetings, conferences, lunches, receptions and dinners that make for 16-hour days.\n''It's technical assistance we're after, not the physical here,'' said Mr. Chowdhury, a compact, dapper man in a gray suit, ''because so many agencies here are involved in economics and trade.''\nUnder the stern photographic gaze of the founding father of Bangladesh, Sheik Mujibur Rahman, Mr. Chowdhury gives assignments to his four assistants in Bengali alternating with English. Then they fan out to agencies across the city.\nSummoning his driver, Mr. Chowdhury hops into his black Mercedes for the short drive to the World Trade Organization. He does not seem to notice the sun reflecting on Lake Leman here, engrossed as he is in examining the agenda for the meeting of the General Council, the decision-making body of the 135-member trade forum.\nMr. Chowdhury has decided to support a rapid-entry process for Bhutan to join the trade group. ''It's a fellow South Asian country'' and one of the less-developed nations, he notes.\nBesides representing Bangladesh, Mr. Chowdhury acts as coordinator for 48 of the poorest countries, only 14 of which can afford to post envoys in Geneva.\nThe meeting has one other item of personal importance to Mr. Chowdhury. The General Council is discussing nominations for deputy director general posts, a sensitive matter after the protracted struggle to choose the group's leader, now Mike Moore of New Zealand. Mindful of their recent public squabbling, delegates are stepping gingerly around the next questions -- the number and homelands of Mr. Moore's deputies.\nMr. Chowdhury, who has advanced degrees in international relations from Australian National University in Canberra, has thrown his hat into the ring. ''This is a chance for Bangladesh to have a top international position,'' he said.\nSome trade representatives say that since Mr. Moore's successor in three years will be Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand, there is no need for Asian representation at the deputy level. But others are pushing for three deputies from the least-developed nations, which they believe are significantly underrepresented.\nThe meeting at the oval, glass-and-wood conference center recesses after half an hour, and Mr. Chowdhury finds his driver and zooms up the hill to the Palais des Nations to meet with Mokammel Haque, chairman of Bangladesh's investment board. They both head for the office of a United Nations trade and development agency deputy, Carlos Fortin, to review what the agency is doing to help Bangladesh, including developing a handbook to attract foreign capital.\nEncouraging such investment is a priority for Mr. Chowdhury, whose predominantly agricultural country on the Bay of Bengal is ravaged from time to time by floods and cyclones. A largely Muslim nation with a population of nearly 125 million, Bangladesh has been trying to shift to a market economy.\nBut the challenges are extraordinary. Perhaps a third of the labor force is unemployed, and poor people can earn less in a year than it costs a visiting envoy to stay for a night in one of this international city's luxury hotels.\nYet, as Mr. Chowdhury sees it, the cost to Bangladesh of stationing a diplomatic mission in Geneva is worth it. ''Ten years ago,'' he said, ''we were exporting less than $1 million, and now it's $3 billion in clothes.''\nInternational aid to his country and its membership in the World Trade Organization have helped strengthen its position as the world's largest exporter of jute. Bangladesh is also seeking business investment for oil and natural gas exploration, the construction of gas pipelines and the development of its computer software industry.\nBy midday, Mr. Chowdhury is running late so he skips his first diplomatic function -- one of nine receptions or lunches as well as four dinners during the week, at three of which he is the host.\nEnergetic and friendly, Mr. Chowdhury says he does not mind the frenetic pace. ''I'm trying to raise Bangladesh's profile here,'' he explains.\nZipping around Geneva's noontime traffic, his driver drops him off for lunch with an official from the World Economic Forum. Their topic is Bangladesh's participation in an investment seminar in New Delhi. Then it is back to the World Trade Organization's stately lakeside headquarters, where its General Council resumes discussion of the choice of deputies.\nThere is a desire among delegates to make a decision before they leave next month for Seattle, where they will start the next round of global trade negotiations.\nNearly three hours later, he is back in his office fielding phone calls, looking at more accumulated mail and preparing for the next day's meetings.\nAt 6:30, he heads into an evening of three receptions, the first given by American officials attending a United Nations refugee agency's executive board meeting. Mr. Chowdhury wants to put in an appearance to make sure that his country's problems from a flood of refugees from Myanmar stays on the agenda.\nThen it is off to a reception given by the Swedish envoy, and then one for Nigeria's Commerce Minister. At 8:30, he joins his wife, Nicole, for a dinner with a potential investor in Bangladesh, and wraps up the day at 11 P.M.\n''It's heavy work, but very stimulating,'' he said. ''Intellectually, it's very demanding and challenging because you must switch from one area to another, but it's rewarding because you can see the tangible benefits to your country.''",

    "text": "An Increasing Vulnerability to Natural Disasters\n1999-09-10T05:00:00.000Z\nThe tragic earthquake in Greece and the enormous devastation and suffering wrought by the recent earthquake in Turkey are reminders of one of the most pressing challenges of our time: the extraordinary increase in the number and extent of natural disasters.\nThe facts are startling. The costs of weather-related disasters in 1998 exceeded the costs of all such disasters in the decade of the 1980s. Tens of thousands of mostly poor people died during the year, tens of millions have been temporarily or permanently displaced.\nIn the Caribbean, the hurricanes designated George and Mitch killed more than 13,000 people, with Mitch being the deadliest Atlantic storm in 200 years. A much less publicized cyclone in India in June caused damage comparable to Mitch and an estimated 10,000 deaths.\nMajor floods hit India, Nepal, Bangladesh and much of East Asia, with thousands killed. Two-thirds of Bangladesh was inundated for months, leaving millions homeless. More than 3,000 people died in China's catastrophic Yangtze River flood, millions were displaced, and the financial cost is estimated at an astonishing $30 billion\nFires ravaged tens of thousands of square kilometers of forest in Brazil, Indonesia and Siberia, with devastating consequences for human health and local economies. In Afghanistan earthquakes killed more than 9,000 people, while the exact toll of the horrific earthquake in Turkey is still unknown.\nWe know that human communities will always have to face natural hazards, whether floods, droughts, storms or earthquakes. But today's disasters owe as much to human activities as to the forces of nature. Indeed the term \"natural\" is increasingly misleading.\nA wide variation in the number and intensity of natural hazards is normal and to be expected. What we have witnessed over the past decades, however, is not nature's variation but a clear upward trend caused by human activities. There were three times as many great natural disasters in the 1990s as in the 1960s, while disaster costs increased more than nine-fold in the same period.\nWe know why the trend is upward. Ninety percent of disaster victims\nworldwide live in developing countries, where poverty and population pressures force growing numbers of people to live in harm's way \u2014 on flood plains, in earthquake-prone zones and on unstable hillsides. Unsafe buildings compound the risks. The vulnerability of those living in risk-prone areas is perhaps the single most important cause of disaster casualties and damage.\nSecond, we know that unsound development and environmental practices exacerbate the problem. Massive logging operations and the destruction of wetlands reduce the soil's ability to absorb heavy rainfall, making erosion and flooding more likely.\nIt is not just the costs of natural disasters that are exacerbated by human action. Many scientists believe that the recent upsurge of weather-related natural disasters is the product of increased global warming, much of which is caused by human activity. While the earth has always experienced natural cycles of warming and cooling, the 14 hottest years since measurements first began in the 1860s have occurred in the past two decades. 1998 was the hottest year on record.\nGiven that the pressures of poverty and population growth continue to increase, the disaster trend is likely to worsen if we do not take disaster prevention more seriously.\nMore effective prevention, as the dedicated staff of the UN International Decade of Natural Disaster Reduction have tirelessly argued, requires better early warning of impending disasters to give vulnerable populations time to move out of harm's way. It also requires more effective disaster response policies. But above all it requires that we reduce the vulnerabilities that cause the damage in the first place.\nOur tasks are clear. Development, land use and habitation policy must be informed by a thorough understanding of the scientific and technical requirements of prevention.\nDisaster reduction legislation is crucial, but not sufficient. The best laws are useless if not effectively and impartially enforced.\nAbove all we must never forget that it is poverty, not choice, that drives people to live in risk-prone areas. Equitable and sustainable economic development is not only a good in its own right, but also one of the best forms of disaster insurance.\nThere are some reasons for optimism. Radical improvements in wide-area satellite surveillance is revolutionizing disaster early warning, while the Internet can provide instant dissemination of the satellite and other warning data. These developments have been particularly important with respect to weather-related natural disasters.\nBut successful disaster prevention is not dependent on access to advanced technologies. Last year in one Honduran village, the hurricane desig-nated Mitch claimed more than 150 lives. In an equally exposed vil-lage nearby, where a disaster reduction pilot program was in place, there were no deaths.\nIn China, where extensive disaster control policies have been introduced over the years, the death toll from floods has fallen dramatically. Flooding cost more than 3,000 lives in China in 1998, but similar floods in 1931 and 1954 cost 140,000 and 33,000 lives respectively. Prevention strategies saved tens of thousands of lives.\nWhile much can be done at the local level with modest financial resources, some major risk reduction and disaster prevention programs require levels of funding that many poor countries simply cannot afford. International assistance is both critical and cost-effective here.\nWe now know what has to be done, what is needed is the political will to do it.\n-\nThe writer is secretary-general of the United Nations.",

    "text": "Making Disaster Less Disastrous\n1999-09-19T05:00:00.000Z\nThe mass escape from Hurricane Floyd was further evidence of how well this country has learned to anticipate potential disaster. We get timely warnings and instructions on how to board up our windows and when to get out. Buildings are constructed to withstand most calamities. Natural disaster here does not cause thousands of deaths.\nIn much of the world, however, disaster means death. Turkey's earthquake last month crushed at least 15,000 people, most in the rubble of shoddily built apartment houses. Some Turkish experts believe that almost all of them would be alive today if Turkey had enforced building codes and educated people about the hazards of poor construction.\nThe need to prevent death and destruction is rising because there are more major disasters than ever before, and they are more deadly. According to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, there were three times as many major disasters in the 1990's as there were in the 1960's. Disasters today also cause far more destruction, due to an increase in population, environmental degradation and poverty. All three factors fatally combined last year to cause a huge death toll in Central America during Hurricane Mitch. Overcrowding and poverty had forced thousands of poor people to build flimsy housing in river basins and on hillsides. Deforestation had left those areas susceptible to flooding and mudslides.\nIn 1989, in an effort to minimize the human toll, the United Nations set up the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, an agency to help countries assess risks and prepare for calamities. The agency has worked all over the world to emphasize prevention and help scientists, governments and communities devise and carry out plans.\nWhile it may take an outright miracle to persuade some nations to clean up their environment or the corruption that invites shoddy building, many effective measures to cut deaths are within reach of even the poorest countries. In 1991, flooding in Bangladesh killed at least 140,000 people. Last year the floods were more widespread and long-lasting, but fewer than 1,000 people died. This was due in part to better sanitation that reduced post-flood disease, more effective warnings and school programs about disaster risks and responses. Many villages also built raised-earth mounds with trees, fish ponds, wells and fodder for animals. In the past, villagers had been reluctant to leave their houses if it meant abandoning cattle.\nOne reason countries have been so poorly prepared for disaster is that most of them have regarded money spent on hypothetical situations as wasted. In addition, prevention often goes unnoticed when it works. One U.N. pilot program in nine earthquake-prone cities seeks to make the risks more specific by predicting areas where damage is most likely. The Turkish city of Izmir, which largely escaped the major earthquake, is one participant. After the quake, Izmir officials identified susceptible neighborhoods and began a program to retrofit buildings in those areas.\nThe cost of disasters can even inspire countries to change their environmental policies. After last year's Yangtze River floods, which took 2,100 lives and cost China an estimated $30 billion, China admitted that deforestation and other ecological damage was a major cause. The Government banned logging on the upper Yangtze and began a tree-planting program. While disasters usually inflict the most suffering on the poor, who have the least political clout, many countries will begin to take steps to reduce death and damage once they realize that the destruction is hugely expensive -- and to some degree an act of man, not God.",

    "text": "A Force Now In the World, Citizens Flex Social Muscle\n1999-07-10T05:00:00.000Z\nTwenty years ago social activists could identify only one independent organization working to protect the environment in Indonesia. Today there are more than 2,000, an environmental network based in Jakarta reports.\n Citizen organizations have been similarly emerging across much of the world. In Slovakia, there were a handful of such organizations active in the 1980's; now there are more than 10,000. In the Philippines, registered nonprofit organizations grew from 18,000 to 58,000 between 1989 and 1996. And in the United States, aside from religious groups and private foundations, 70 percent of nonprofit organizations filing returns with the I.R.S. are less than 30 years old; a third are less than 15.\nTo some economists and social scientists, the astonishing growth of citizen-led organizations signals a new kind of global revolution. ''It is reshaping politics and economics both at the domestic and global levels,'' said Lester M. Salamon, the director of the Center for Civil Society Studies at Johns Hopkins University. ''I believe it is as important a development to the latter part of the 20th century as the rise of the nation-state was at the end of the 19th century.''\n Consider recent events in which citizens' groups were major players: the defeat of apartheid in South Africa; the end of the dictatorship in Chile; the political transformation in the Philippines; the overthrow of Communist regimes in Central Europe; the creation of an international treaty prohibiting land mines; the establishment of an international criminal court.\n Organizations founded by private individuals have historically played a vital role in democracies. Writing in the 1830's, Alexis de Tocqueville remarked that nothing was more deserving of attention than America's associations. Women's suffrage, organized labor, civil rights, consumer protection, environmental protection, gay liberation and the rights of the disabled are all movements pioneered by citizen organizations. \n What is different today, however, is not only the increasing number of these groups worldwide, but also the view that they are a distinct sector, one that, like government, serves essential social functions, but that has many of the entrepreneurial qualities of business. The profit, in this case, is primarily social progress.\n ''This new sector really is competitive like business,'' said William Drayton, the president of Ashoka, an organization, named for an altruistic emperor of India, that supports people working to bring about social changes in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Central Europe. ''It's got open entry. Organizations are competing for money, for recognition, for staff.'' \n Mr. Drayton and others hold that the citizen sector is leading the social half of society through the same type of changes that transformed the European economy three centuries ago.\n ''In the early business environment, the right to conduct different businesses was given by the crown,'' said Sharon Oster, a professor of economics at the Yale School of Management. ''That monopoly model fell apart and became a competitive model.'' As controls on economic enterprises were loosened in the 17th and 18th centuries, new players flooded the field of business. \n Just as trade and manufacturing were monopolized centuries ago, colonial and authoritarian Governments pretty much monopolized the social arena. The viceroys in India, the Communists in Central Europe the generals in Latin America and Africa had little tolerance for citizens who tried to engineer broad social change.\n As colonies gained independence and democracy spread, opportunities opened up for what Mr. Drayton called social entrepreneurs. These people, he said, have vision, practical ability and drive, they cannot rest until they have solved social problems not just locally, but systemwide. Think of Florence Nightingale, who developed modern nursing; Ralph Nader, who pioneered the consumer movement, or Muhammad Yunus, who founded the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and spread the idea of microcredit -- small loans to fight poverty -- around the world.\n At the same time, such breakthrough movements as Gandhian self-reliance and nonviolence, civil rights, liberation theology and feminism have helped prime hundreds of millions of people for social engagement. And the growth of the middle class has increased the pool of potential recruits. \n Mr. Drayton sought to catalyze the citizen sector by adapting the venture-capital approach. The idea was to search for budding innovators to supply them with seed money and connect them in a global fellowship. In 1980 he created Ashoka, which has its headquarters in Arlington, Va., and now supports nearly 1,000 social entrepreneurs in 33 countries. Among them are Vera Cordeiro and Wojciech Onyszkiewicz. Ms. Cordeiro has built a program in Rio de Janeiro to help prevent recurring illnesses by providing post-hospitalization assistance to poor children and their families. Mr. Onyszkiewicz built an unusual food bank in Poland, through an exchange in which farmers donate food to the urban poor and rural children are taken on educational trips to Warsaw. \n Mr. Drayton said that the business sector had grown in productivity because it developed a beneficial competitive approach that rewarded innovation. He believes competition in the social sector could generate the same kinds of productivity increases. \n ''When there is a critical mass of institutions, people and ideas, and they feed on one another and strengthen one another, the competitive revolution begins to set in,'' Mr. Drayton said. ''You begin to get a culture that says: 'This is great. We're proud to be doing this. We admire people who do this well. We reward them.' It happened in business and it's exactly what you're seeing at the moment in the citizen sector.''\n J. Gregory Dees, who teaches social entrepreneurship at the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University, said: ''I'm seeing two broad trends. One is a shift away from the idea of this sector being primarily about charity and the transfer of wealth to being about a desire to find more systemic and sustained solutions to social problems. And the other is an increased openness to experimenting with business methods and market-based approaches.''\n These days, donors are more apt to stop financing organizations that cannot demonstrate their effectiveness. Some winning ideas, on the other hand, are rewarded. The Grameen Bank and the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, a citizen organization, have been so successful in alleviating poverty and educating millions of villagers that they have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars of financing from around the globe. More than a thousand development programs worldwide are emulating their experiences. \n Some activists fear too much competition, arguing that groups can be more effective by forming coalitions. ''We need to find better ways to cooperate with one another if we are going to advocate effectively,'' said Laurie Regelbrugge, the chief operating officer of Civicus, an international network of citizen organizations.\n Barry Nalebuff, a management professor at the Yale School of Management, points to a different kind of problem: that growth does not necessarily lead to productivity gains unless accompanied by market discipline. ''There are too many nonprofits today and the reason is simply the difficulty in getting them to merge,'' Mr. Nalebuff said. ''In the for-profit sector, if an organization is doing poorly, somebody can take it over. There is no such thing as a nonfriendly acquisition in this sector. You need to be in bankruptcy before you lose control, the result being that we have much redundancy.'' \n And Christine W. Letts, executive director of the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations at Harvard, said that to deliver the goods -- i.e., social change -- ''at a cost that is appropriate for its performance,'' this new sector needs to develop better information systems and standards. ''The issue is how much is wasted,'' she added.\n Still, the advocates are optimistic. ''There has been a general questioning of the capacity of the state to carry out a whole host of functions,'' Mr. Salamon said. ''This sector represents another way of organizing the common business of society.'' \n Past experience and a faster rate of change mean that in 20 years the citizen sector ''will be almost unrecognizably more mature,'' Mr. Drayton said. ''Many of the institutions that took business 300 years to develop will be well on their way to development,'' he predicted.",

    "text": "Pakistan Ought to Concentrate on Pulling Itself Together\n1999-07-14T05:00:00.000Z\nThe latest military adventure in Kashmir is yet another variation on a familiar theme, Pakistan's obsession with India.\nIn 1947, after the birth of both nations, Pakistan sent Pashtun tribesmen to attack Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir; the attack failed. In 1965, Pakistan infiltrated large numbers of armed militants into Kashmir and ended up losingan all-out war. The most recent incursion appears to be out of the control of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.\nIt is the work of Pakistan's military intelligence agency supporting religious zealots so bent on integrating Kashmir that they are blind to the disintegration at home.\nPakistan was an invention of Mohammed Ali Jinnah, who promised a homeland for all of the Muslims living in British India. That dream has failed, since more Muslims live in India than in Pakistan, which is little more than a collection of tribes, warring factions and increasingly radical Islamists.\nThe Pashtuns, whose homeland was cut in two by the British, come and go across an artificial border with Afghanistan, trading, smuggling and leading the Taliban militia's successful takeover of that country. In the mountains near the Khyber Pass, one cannot tell an Afghan Taliban from a Pakistani Taliban. They envision an independent Pashtunistan, incorporating Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province with much of Afghanistan.\nThe Baluchis of southwest Pakistan feel closer to their ethnic brothers in neighboring Iran and Afghanistan than to the Punjab-dominated central government, which bloodily suppressed their rebellion in the early 1970s.\nSindh, Pakistan's second most populous province, is ruled directly by Islamabad to keep order in violence-prone Karachi, the commercial center. It is being torn apart by fighting between the indigenous population and migrants (Muhajirs) from India and Bangladesh. Muhajir groups have begun killing each other.\nThe Sindhis, like the Pashtuns and the Baluchis, are chafing under the domination of Pakistan's most important region, Punjab. With 56 percent of the population, the Punjabis run the country, staffing the officer corps, the civil service and just about everything else.\nMeanwhile, Shiite Muslims, around 20 percent of Pakistan's population, are being targeted by radical Sunni groups inflamed by the Taliban example. Last year almost 1,000 people were killed in clashes between Sunni and Shiite militants.\nMany extreme Sunni Islamists seem to hate the Shiites more than the West, or India. The existence of the Shiites is an offense against these Sunnis' vision of a unified \"Muslim community of the faithful.\"\nIt is this vision that is promoted in more than 7,000 Islamic fundamentalist schools and seminaries that have spread rapidly as Pakistan's state education failed to push literacy rates above 40 percent. These schools are breeding grounds for \"mujahidin,\" or holy warriors who are sent to Talibanize Kashmir. Graduates also provide the manpower for radical Islamic political parties and for the Sunni Muslim gangs waging the murderous campaign against the Shiites.\nAdd to this mix of ethnic conflicts and religious zealotry an economy still reeling from last year's post-nuclear testing crisis. Trying to keep up with India, a country with six times its GDP and 15 times its foreign exchange, Pakistan is running on empty. It has an external debt of $30 billion (half of its GDP) and has been bailed out by the IMF 17 times. The lion's share of government spending goes to defense and debt service.\nThe international community, including China, blames Pakistan for the flare-up in Kashmir. Pakistan's famous three A's \u2014 Allah, the army and America \u2014 may soon become AA, with the United States likely to reimpose trade sanctions and block further IMF loans.\nAnd, of course, there is the growing impatience of India.\nIncited by militant groups and ultranationalists, many Indians now say that their nation's problem has been the failure of Hindus to stand up and fight. They insist that Islam's intolerance and claim to exclusive truth have led to the destruction of Hindu treasures and the defiling of its holy places.\nThey cite the centuries when Kashmir was the route of choice for conquerors who swept down from Afghanistan onto the Indian plains, massacring Hindus or converting them to Islam. \"Today Srinagar, tomorrow Delhi\" was the Moghul's fearsome cry. These Indians be-lieve that nothing has changed.Kashmir is the only Muslim-majority state in India's union. It affirms the country's nondenominational character \u2014 a single nation with a plurality of religions and cultures. Hindus and Muslims live and work side by side throughout India, contributing to every aspect of the nation's life. So much so that the father of India's \"Hindu\" nuclear bomb is a Muslim.\nThe worst thing that could happen to Pakistan would be for it to succeed in wresting Kashmir and its 4 million Muslims from India. Led by Hindu extremists, the ethnic cleansing of millions of Muslims living in India would make Bosnia and Kosovo seem like a picnic. And a further flood of refugees would destroy Pakistan.\nPresent and former Indian government officials, military leaders, businessmen and journalists \u2014 Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs \u2014 agree that this is an all too likely outcome. The partition of British India in 1947 created more than 11 million refugees and provoked almosta million deaths.\nPakistan should revert to Jinnah's dream of a moderate, secular Islamic state. And when casting envious glares at Kashmir, it needs to remember the adage: Be careful what you wish for, you may get it.\nThe writer is founder and chairman of Business Executives for National Security, an organization of U.S. business leaders.

    "text": "Doctors' Group Of Volunteers Awarded Nobel\n1999-10-16T05:00:00.000Z\nDoctors Without Borders, which sends medical personnel to some of the most destitute and dangerous parts of the world and encourages them not only to save lives, but also to condemn the injustices they see, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize today.\nFounded here in 1971 as Medecins Sans Frontieres by a band of French doctors disillusioned with the neutrality of the Red Cross, the volunteer group now has more than 2,000 personnel who are treating the wounded, the sick and the starving in 80 countries, including 20 war zones.\nOver the years, the group has been expelled from several countries for denouncing what it saw as wrong. In 1985 it was banned from Ethiopia for saying the Government had diverted aid and forced migration. In late 1995, the group withdrew from Zaire and Tanzania and denounced the operation of the refugee camps, because, it said, the camps were being controlled by Hutu leaders who had been responsible for the genocide in neighboring Rwanda.\nIn recognizing the work of the organization, the Norwegian Nobel Committee highlighted the willingness to send volunteers quickly to scenes of disaster, regardless of the politics of a situation. And it praised the group for drawing the world's attention to the causes of catastrophes, which ''helps to form bodies of public opinion opposed to violations and abuses of power.''\n''In critical situations marked by violence and brutality, the humanitarian world of Doctors Without Borders enables the organization to create openings for contacts between the opposed parties,'' the citation said. ''At the same time, each fearless and self-sacrificing helper shows each victim a human face, stands for respect for that person's dignity, and is a source of hope for peace and reconciliation.''\nAt the modest headquarters here, dozens of workers gathered to drink Champagne.\nThe president of the group in France, Phillipe Biberson, said the award was an occasion to shine some light once again on those his group tried to help, the starving, those living in battle zones and those suffering from diseases like malaria that rarely get the world's attention.\n''If we are not sure that words can save,'' Mr. Biberson said, ''we do know that silence kills.''\nOne in four of the doctors who travel with the group to trouble spots are French, although in recent years volunteers from 45 other countries have taken part.\nThe doctors and nurses, who receive a stipend of about $750 a month, often work under extreme conditions. In Angola this year, they have maintained a clinic in Kuito, a town that has repeatedly been cut off by rebel fighters.\nAlthough some work is in hot spots like Kosovo, many of the projects are far out of the limelight: family planning in Armenia, basic health care in Haiti and care for the homeless in Moscow. In recent years, the agency has also achieved some logistical triumphs. In 1995 in response to a meningitis epidemic in Nigeria, staff members vaccinated four million people in three months.\nSince the prize was first awarded in 1901, 18 other organizations have been named as winners or co-winners. Those have included the International Red Cross, International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War and Amnesty International. The most recent was the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines, which shared the award in 1997 with its coordinator, Jody Williams of the United States.\nNobel officials said they had 136 nominees this year, of which 101 were individuals and 35 were organizations. The committee members are highly guarded about their deliberations and rarely let slip advance word on the winner. But nominees for the prize are often identified publicly by the individuals and organization that put forward the candidates.\nOn that basis, Norwegian newspapers have reported the nominations of President Clinton, President Ezer Weizman of Israel and two Chinese dissidents, Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan, among others.\nLast week, a newspaper in Oslo, Dagbladet, said it had learned that the prize would be shared by the Chinese dissidents. The false report spurred Chinese officials here to protest the supposed choice with the Norwegian Government, though the Government has nothing to do with the selection.\nThe choice of Doctors Without Borders is not expected to help along some delicate peace process. But the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Francis Sejersted, said the panel hoped that it would inspire Doctors Without Borders and similar organizations to step up their work.\n''There is growing need for humanitarian organizations of this kind in today's world,'' Mr. Sejersted said. But he singled out the group's commitment to Africa, because the misery there often fades from public consciousness.\nIn recent years the agency, like many others, has complained of growing difficulty in raising money. Today, officials said that they would probably simply put the nearly $1 million of prize money into their budget.\nIt is also more difficult to find volunteers.\n''Many doctors today are facing economical constraints,'' the medical director of the group, Dr. Marc Gastellu Etchegorry, said. ''Taking six months off when they have school bills to pay is hard. And, yes, some of them are thinking more about playing golf.''\nThe group grew out of the frustration of a group of young doctors who worked for the Red Cross and treated the starving in Biafra at the end of the 60's. But Red Cross confidentiality prevented them from speaking out. They organized themselves in 1971 after the severe flooding in Bangladesh (then East Pakistan).\nPoorly equipped and, perhaps, a little too media-hungry, they were dismissed by some aid agencies as cowboys. That criticism is long gone now. But some aid agencies still scorn Doctors Without Borders for its cozy relationship with the news media and its sometimes glitzy image of attractive young doctors in the field. It is sometimes cattily referred to by its rivals as ''Publicite Sans Limites,'' Publicity Without Limits.\nMany founders of the group insist that speaking out about atrocities would help prevent them. Bernard Kouchner, a founder who is the senior United Nations representative in Kosovo, said today that agencies like Medecins Sans Frontieres would help make massacres like Auschwitz, Cambodia and Rwanda impossible in the next century.\n''It is very important that M.S.F. does not offer shelter for disgraceful acts and suffering,'' Mr. Kouchner said. ''We need to convince people that the suffering of one man was the responsibility of all men. This work is not done, far from it.''",

    "text": "Sufia Kamal, Poet and Advocate, Dies at 88\n1999-11-28T05:00:00.000Z\nSufia Kamal, a Bangladeshi poet, political activist and feminist, died at age 88 on Nov. 20 and was buried four days later with full state honors, the first woman to receive that recognition from Bangladesh.\nAs the national flag was lowered and buglers saluted, about 10,000 people paid their respects to Ms. Kamal at her funeral on Wednesday in Dhaka.\nBorn into wealth, she had devoted her life to fighting for the rights of women and the poor and against the forces of religious fundamentalism.\n''This poet was the beacon for our great language movement and liberation war, and inspiration for all democratic movements of the nation,'' Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh said at the ceremony. ''This poet was a vast source of inspiration for building up womenfolk as self-reliant.''\nSufia Kamal was born in 1911 in Barisal, the southern district of what is now Bangladesh, the only daughter of an eminent lawyer. As a woman, she did not have an opportunity to pursue an education, but she educated herself in her uncle's library with her mother's encouragement.\nShe was first married at the age of 11 to her cousin Syed Nehal Hossain, then a law student. They had a daughter, Amena Kahnar, and Mr. Hossain died in 1932. Five years later, Ms. Kamal married Kamaluddin Ahmed.\nIn addition to her first daughter, Ms. Kamal is survived by two other daughters, Sultana Kamal and Saida Kamal; two sons, Shahed Kamal and Sazid Kamal; three grandsons, and three great-granddaughters.\nShe published her first story at 14, and her prose and poems drew favorable notice. Some works were aimed at children. Some were translated into English and Russian. Increasingly, she wrote against religious communalism, fundamentalism and superstitions. She promoted democracy and women's emancipation.\n''The culture was to keep the women at home, train them in household chores and make them perfect women: docile, ready to please everyone in the family,'' she said in an interview earlier this year. ''There was a strong anti-British movement, and my family also believed that women should stay out of it.\n''But I had an indomitable nature and I crossed my limits to get a taste of all there was. I was allowed to learn Arabic and a little Persian, but not Bengali. I made it a point to learn Bengali from people working in the house.'' That became the language she used for her writing.\nThough she called herself a romantic poet, her work more and more reflected the struggles to preserve the Bengali language and culture and to fight Pakistani rulers. During Bangladesh's struggle for independence from Pakistan in the early 1970's she worked to help women hurt by the war. She also worked with an organization to try to bring to justice those Pakistani officials whom the Bangladeshis considered war criminals.\nIn later life, she made women's rights her top priority and headed Bangladesh's largest women's organization for many years. She did not see the oppression of women as mainly a class issue.\n''My own experience as a woman made me sensitive toward the condition of women of all classes,'' she said. ''Be poor or middle class or upper class, the violence against women in family, society and in public life was always there. Women were exploited and deprived of opportunities.''\nIn 1993, an Islamic fundamentalist group called for her execution as punishment for her denunciation of the fundamentalists' treatment of women. Her response was quiet resistance rather than the stronger advocacy of an earlier Bangladeshi poet, Taslima Nareen, who fled the country for fear of reprisals.\nMs. Kamal's strongest and most thoughtful sentiments may have appeared in her poems rather than her prose.\nOne poem, ''Our Language: The Language of Bengal,'' ends with the following lines:\nFor our language many have died,\ndrawn from the arms of our mother\nbut down the road, smeared with their blood\nI hope freedom will come to this land:\nthe simple language of a simple people\nWill meet the demands of this our land.\nBefore her death Ms. Kamal specified that she preferred to be buried in a simple private cemetery rather than in the national cemetery, where her nation's leaders had suggested she be buried. Her views on the country's leaders, expressed in the interview earlier this year, suggest why.\n''Our people are courageous; our leaders are not,'' she said. ''Today they recourse to bombastic rhetoric but never take bold decisions because they may be unpleasant. Why? Because they lack courage.''",

    "text": "FAR FROM HOME, ALONE -- A special report.; Young Immigrants Find a Hard New Land\n1999-03-14T05:00:00.000Z\nMonir was hardly among the huddled, hungry masses of Bangladesh when he arrived at Kennedy International Airport three years ago. His father was an engineer; everyone expected Monir would go to college and study accounting.\nWhat drove him from home was neither poverty nor war, just the sure specter of a dead-end future. Back in Dhaka, all but the wealthiest toiled through college only to hunt in vain for decent jobs. At 15, Monir took flight, in search of an American education, another life.\nNow 18 and still struggling through his sophomore year of high school, Monir works late every night, packing takeout orders of Thai food. The fear of failure follows him like a ghost. It is there when he cannot get to school on time, when he realizes how far behind he is on his homework, when he spots a classmate who dropped out a while back, handing out fliers for an Indian restaurant in the East Village.\n''I have those worries,'' Monir confessed quietly. ''Maybe I'll end up like him.''\nThey are elusive to official institutions, but youngsters like Monir are everywhere. They deliver pizza on rickety bicycles. They cut flower stems at the corner greengrocer. They peddle fake-label watches on the sidewalks of Manhattan and sprint at the sight of the police.\nOver the last several years, a small but growing number of teen-agers -- virtually all boys, some as young as 14 or 15 -- have arrived without their parents, much like the child immigrants of a century ago. Once here, they become New York's youngest immigrant workers, their cheap, nimble labor easily absorbed by the city's thriving service economy.\nThey come from countries where the poor go to work young. They know they are trading one hard life for another, but at least this one seems to come with options. Here, on their own, they are free, and yet they are trapped in an underground ruled in large measure by fear -- of the immigration authorities, child welfare agencies, smugglers, thugs and bosses, past and potential. (That is why all of the youngsters interviewed for this article would give only their first names; some refused to be photographed.)\nAnd immigration scholars and social workers wonder if they will ever be able to break free. Most are in this country illegally -- and with rare exception, seem destined to remain so. Many come for education, and its promise of opportunity unimaginable in Dhaka, or whatever place they left behind. And yet, working long, hard hours to stay alive, they often find themselves too tired and tied down, and simply too poor, to get the education they need to move beyond the margins of the economy.\nIn short, they are like a lot of new immigrants. And yet they are not -- because they are children, and they are alone.\nJust how many there are cannot be known, but the few institutions that encounter them offer piecemeal evidence of their growing presence. The Immigration and Naturalization Service reports a fivefold increase in the number of unaccompanied minors entering the country illegally over the last five years. In fiscal year 1998, the agency had 4,284 such children in detention, the vast majority between 15 and 18. Officials say they expect many more to come from parts of Central America ravaged by Hurricane Mitch.\nAt the Chinatown Health Center, doctors report seeing many more children coming alone, especially from Fujian province, over the last four years. English teachers at The Door, a SoHo youth center, say they have seen rising numbers of teen-agers coming alone from Mexico and Central America.\n''It's really spiked, starting about three years ago,'' said Christopher Ambrose, the center's co-director. ''It's just incredible to me that they're doing what they're doing all by themselves.''\nAmong the ranks of teen-age immigrants to the city was a young man from Guinea named Amadou Diallo, whose American adventure began three years ago at age 19 and ended last month when, unarmed, he was killed by the police at the door to his apartment building in the Bronx. There are boys like Francisco, from Mexico, who run away defiantly, and those like Abdoulaye, from Senegal, who come with their parents' blessings. There are those like Monir who live on their own, perhaps with a roommate, and those who are taken in by relatives, like Jian, a Fujianese farmer's son, who shares a two-room tenement in Chinatown with an uncle and eight other men.\nAll are keenly, constantly aware of the gulf between them and the young people around them -- many of them also poor, many also immigrants, but none quite so peculiarly alone. Jian is struck by this every time he runs into schoolmates from Qianyang, his village outside the city of Fuzhou. If they work, it is not to pay the rent. Their parents take care of that, and harangue them to finish their homework so they do not have to work in sweatshops all their lives.\nOnce, Jian invited his old best friend over to his apartment, and his friend gasped. ''He said, 'I can't imagine you live here,' '' Jian recalls. ''We are like strangers.''\nA Life of Work\nLong Hours And Long Odds\nFrancisco's day begins in the blue light before dawn, as the steel accordion gates of a lower Manhattan diner roll open for business. Francisco's territory is the grill, where he hovers over burgers and B.L.T.'s. To his left sits a vat of gurgling hot oil that has pocked his arms with a trail of burns. A Yankees cap shields his boyish, blessedly acne-free face.\nExcept Sundays, when he makes sandwiches at another deli, this is Francisco's world all week, from 4:30 A.M. till 3:30 in the afternoon. After work, there are lessons at The Door, where he has learned English and is now, after nearly a decade without a formal education, preparing for the high school equivalency exam. Then, home by 8 to his room in a basement apartment near Yankee Stadium, so he can shower, sleep and rise by 3 A.M. for another day at the grill.\nHe is 21 now, but Francisco's childhood died young, in the Oaxacan village of Etla. By the time he was 10, he was hopping trains to faraway towns, where he passed himself off as an orphan and ran errands in exchange for food, spare change, a set of new clothes.\nHis parents tried to wring the restlessness out of him, but without success. With the help of a friend already living in the Bronx, he found a smuggler, who for $900 led him across the border and onto a plane to New York. Francisco thinks he was 15 then.\nWithin weeks, he was sweeping the floors of a midtown garment factory, 10 or 12 hours every day, for $190 a week.\nFinding work was always a breeze, though the terms of his employment were completely illegal. Under state law, school is mandatory for all those under 17. And youths between ages 16 and 18 are barred from working more than 28 hours a week when school is in session.\nOnce, cutting a swatch of linen, Francisco accidentally sliced off a piece of his left index finger. His boss dropped him in front of a hospital emergency room and left. When Francisco returned to work, the boss refused to take him back, saying he was too young.\n''They really took advantage of me, huh?'' Francisco said, chuckling. ''I learned that after I left that job.''\nIn Francisco's fiercely self-protective world, there is little time or inclination to play. Fear keeps him on the straight and narrow. Sometimes, he hangs out with young Mexicans who live in his building, but he will not drink with them, for fear he will not make it to work on time. There are clubs he could go to, but he won't, for fear he will be swept up in a drunken brawl.\nPerhaps what also keeps Francisco on his path of self-restraint is boys like Marcos. The two are strangers, but in a way, they are mirror images.\nWhen Marcos left Oaxaca at age 12, he, too, was searching for money and education. Seven years later, he has not known a day of school, nor has he managed to learn English. He has been a dishwasher, a pizza deliverer and a prep cook. He has also been to Rikers Island and back.\nMarcos has never really been out of trouble. At first, he was taunted in his East Harlem neighborhood as a ''mojado,'' a wetback. Thugs repeatedly jumped him, taking what little money he made.\nSoon, though, another band of thugs came to his rescue. They called themselves Los Vagos, the vagabonds, and they became his family. They tattooed a tricolor Virgin on his left arm; they made sure he was never attacked again.\nBut trouble continued to trail him. Within months, a knife fight at a soccer match got him six months in jail. And in December, one of Los Vagos was shot and killed at a club on 116th Street; Marcos said he and seven other gang members were charged. He is out on bail, awaiting trial.\n''We say this is the lost generation,'' said Brother Joel Magallan, a Jesuit who works for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York as its liaison to Mexican immigrants. ''I know a lot of parents who are trying to keep them in Mexico. They don't want their kids coming here.''\nFrancisco may have run away at 15, but he never intended to stay away so long, he said. His goal was to earn enough money to establish a family business. Last year, he wired home $11,000 in savings so his father could set up a garment factory. He had read that clothing was one of Mexico's chief exports. Nowhere had he read about the hurdles.\n''You have to have big capital,'' he says now. ''You have to have connections.''\nThe lessons came too late. The five sewing machines bought with his savings now collect dust in Etla.\nChanging Opportunity\nThe Road Narrows For Immigrants\nThe stories of Francisco and the others are a distant echo of the flood of teen-age immigrants a century ago. Back then, at the crest of the last great wave of immigration, Italian boys landed by themselves at Ellis Island and went to work hawking newspapers or hauling produce. Girls from Russia came alone to work in garment factories.\nBut if their aspirations are in many ways the same, today's teen-age immigrants are landing on drastically changed shores.\nNancy Foner, an anthropologist who studies the city's immigration history, offered her own family's example. In 1905 or so, when he was 8 or 9, her grandfather came alone from Russia and joined a brother in Hartford. The sum of his American education was some time in night school as a working teen-ager, but by the time he retired, he was running a lucrative construction business in Queens.\nCertainly, few immigrants of that era bounded up the economic ladder in one generation. Still, those with little schooling could find a factory job -- often, a dirty job for low pay, but a job for life. Some could move from unskilled factory jobs to semi-skilled labor at slightly better pay. Some could even open small shops or factories. And since, with few exceptions, even those without formal papers did not face the constant threat of deportation, even the immigrant who did not succeed economically could establish a firm, legal foothold for the next generation.\n''It's much harder to get ahead today, with as little education as my grandfather had,'' Ms. Foner explained.\nToday's teen-age immigrants, by contrast, are unlikely to be legal and have few ways to change that. Unlike adults with marketable skills, they are unlikely to be sponsored by an employer, and few have resident family members to help them obtain a green card. And their immigration status, compounded by poverty, makes it extremely difficult to get the higher education that is ever more crucial to economic success. For illegal immigrants, a secure job of any kind has become harder to find.\nSo, while some will find a way to get ahead, most seem likely to drift from way station to way station in New York's economic underground, hoping, at best, to save enough money to set up a decent life back home.\n''My guess would be that if you do not have fluency in English, if you do not have skills, if you do not have legal papers, you're going to work in a marginal, shadow economy,'' said David Reimers, a historian at New York University. ''I don't see these people, in their lifetime, improving that much.''\nWhether most will end up staying or returning home is anyone's guess. For now, out there on the margins, they tend to fall below the radar of government agencies that deal with children. Given the choices here and at home, some academics and advocates say, it is probably just as well.\n''It's a pretty sad thing to say that perhaps the best outcome would be let them work, leave them alone,'' said Hector Cordero-Guzman, a sociologist at the New School for Social Research. ''Increased enforcement might not mean better life chances for these kids.''\nThe Education Barrier\nMany Lack Tools To Get Ahead\nIf college is the dream, Jian would seem closer than most. Even so, he feels it slipping away.\nThe first in his family to learn his letters, he is 20 credits shy of a high school diploma. Eight hours a day, he is in class at Manhattan Comprehensive Night and Day School, a school for older teen-agers. Four years after leaving China at age 17, his time is running out. He can attend public school free only until the end of his 21st year; he has just turned 21.\nWeekends are spent behind the Plexiglas of a Chinese takeout restaurant in New Jersey: 12-hour shifts both days, $70 a day. At first, his priorities puzzled his roommates. ''They said: 'Why you want to study? You're not born here,' '' he recalled.\nMany young immigrants like him rarely venture outside Chinatown or learn English, he says. The prospect terrifies him. ''You don't know English, you know how difficult life is,'' Jian said. ''How about the future?''\nFor now, Jian pays $50 a month for a bed in a sixth-floor walk-up. The apartment is so cramped that he does morning sit-ups in bed, so noisy that he starts studying at the kitchen table only after everyone is asleep.\nJian says he has no regrets about coming here. And recently, he was granted a rare boon -- political asylum on the ground of religious persecution. He is a Christian, with the dangerous habit of preaching to his classmates back home. He can become an American citizen in a few years.\nStill, even with the security of asylum, even with a diploma, he says he will have to postpone college until he can climb his mountain of debt: the $40,000 that his parents borrowed from family and from the bank to have him smuggled to America. So after high school, Jian plans to get a full-time restaurant job and start repaying the loans. He does not know anyone who has gone to college here. He says it probably costs too much. ''I'm not sure,'' he concluded, ''but I think it's a lot of money.''\nLonging for Home\nIsolation Amid the Crowd\nBy the time Abdoulaye felt that adolescent urge to take flight from Senegal, nearly every house on his block in Kaolack had sent a young man abroad -- to France, Italy and, in recent years, to the United States. At 19, made restless by a long strike at his university, Abdoulaye joined the odyssey.\n''The new generation -- you have to go out and discover,'' his father had told him before his death. ''To be more lucky than us.''\nAbdoulaye knew America long before he got here. He knew the rhymes of Public Enemy and Tupac Shakur and the names of fashionable sneakers. He also knew how much money his compatriots had made here and taken back to Senegal.\nToday, at 20, Abdoulaye is luckier than many of his peers. He lives with his uncles and their wives in the Bronx. He works at the family business, selling color televisions to fellow Africans. He just wasn't prepared for the loneliness.\nIn a palm-size photo album, he keeps snapshots of his friends back home. Abdoulaye misses their company terribly. On the subway, he listens to Youssou N'Dour on his headphones and writes to them, telling them the truth about this place they all once dreamed of. Recently, he wrote about attending his first American demonstration, in front of the house where Amadou Diallo died.\n''You know, in my country, every time I walk the street, I was with one of my friends,'' he said. ''Here, when I get out of school, I walk by myself. Nobody talks to me. I don't talk to nobody. I feel, 'Where I am? Where I am?' ''\nMonir calls home whenever he is blue, which is evidently often, considering he sometimes runs up a $200 phone bill. Often, the conversation turns to his future here, though, in typical immigrant fashion, he is less than candid about the fine points of his new life. ''I don't really tell them how much I work,'' he confided.\nFor a year and a half, he has worked seven hours a night, six nights a week at the Thai restaurant. At the end of each shift, he pockets $45.\nHis mother still presses him to come home, but so far, his more pragmatic parent has prevailed. ''My father says, 'What is he going to do here?' '' Monir explained.\nMore and more, he asks that same question of himself.\n''I think a lot about whether to stay,'' he said, ''or whether to go back.''",

    "text": "Why Genetically Altered Food Won't Conquer Hunger\n1999-09-01T05:00:00.000Z\nIn the debate over genetically altered foods, proponents like Senator Richard Luger, the Indiana Republican, argue that such products will be essential if we are to feed the world. \n But this claim rests on two persistent misconceptions about hunger: first, that people are hungry because of high population density, and second, that genetic engineering is the best or only way to meet our future needs.\nIn fact, there is no relationship between the prevalence of hunger in a given country and its population. For every densely populated and hungry nation like Bangladesh, there is a sparsely populated and hungry nation like Brazil.\n The world today produces more food per inhabitant than ever before. Enough is available to provide 4.3 pounds to every person every day: two and a half pounds of grain, beans and nuts, about a pound of meat, milk and eggs, and another of fruits and vegetables -- more than anyone could ever eat.\n The real problems are poverty and inequality. Too many people are too poor to buy the food that is available or lack land on which to grow it themselves.\n The second misconception is that genetic engineering is the best way to boost food production. There are two principal technologies on the market. Monsanto makes ''Roundup Ready'' seeds, which are engineered to withstand its herbicide, Roundup. These seeds -- usually soybeans, canola or cotton -- allow farmers to apply the herbicide widely. \n Monsanto and several other companies also produce ''Bt'' seeds -- usually corn, potatoes and cotton -- which are engineered so that each plant produces its own insecticide.\n Some researchers have shown that none of the genetically engineered seeds significantly increase the yield of crops. Indeed, in more than 8,200 field trials, the Roundup Ready seeds produced fewer bushels of soybeans than similar natural varieties, according to a study by Dr. Charles Benbrook, the former director of the Board on Agriculture at the National Academy of Sciences.\n Far from being a solution to the world's hunger problem, the rapid introduction of genetically engineered crops may actually threaten agriculture and food security. \n First, widespread adoption of herbicide-resistant seeds may lead to greater use of chemicals that kill weeds. Yet, many noncrop plants are used by small farmers in the third world as supplemental food sources and as animal feed. In the United States, the Fish and Wildlife Service has found that Roundup already threatens 74 endangered plant species.\n Biological pollution from genetically engineered organisms may be another problem. Monsanto is poised to acquire the rights to a genetic engineering technique that renders a crop's seeds sterile, insuring that farmers are dependent on Monsanto for new seed every year. Farming in the third world could be crippled if these genes contaminate other local crops that the poor depend on. And such genes could unintentionally sterilize other plants, according to a study by Martha Crouch, an associate professor of biology at Indiana University. Half the world's farmers rely on their own saved seed for each year's harvest.\n A true solution to the problem of hunger depends on attacking poverty and inequality among both producers and consumers of food. A food system increasingly dependent on genetically altered seeds takes us in the wrong direction.",

    "text": "Look Out for the Nongovernmental Organizations in Seattle\n1999-11-19T05:00:00.000Z\nAs powerful proponents of trade liberalization prepare for the ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle this month, activist groups are planning their own meetings and demonstrations to fight for labor, health, consumer and environmental standards threatened by the WTO's current agenda.\nThe big story in Seattle may not be the WTO and its trade negotiations but the influence that citizen protests around the world, coordinated by thousands of nongovernmental organizations, or NGOs, exercises over one of the most powerful yet least accountable transnational organizations.\nDespite having modest budgets and resources compared with those of their government and business counterparts, NGOs are increasingly powerful players in local, national and international decision-making.\nThe proliferation of NGOs and the spread of their influence have been rapid. Around 70 percent of the 2 million NGOs in the United States were set up in the last three decades. In the same period, the number operating internationally \u2014 that is, with a significant presence in three or more countries \u2014 has quadrupled to some 20,000.\nMany have proved more adept than governments and business at responding to social and environmental problems. In Bangladesh, a child is more likely to learn to read with the assistance of one of the 5,000 NGOs working on literacy programs than through a state school or organization.\nIncreasingly, NGOs operate in worldwide coalitions, teaming up to give local issues international prominence, or international issues local relevance. By withholding or conferring public support, they affected policies of the world's most powerful institutions.\nGreenpeace and other environmental and health groups in Europe have rallied consumers against the bio-agricultural industry's efforts to get genetically modified foods onto supermarket shelves without sufficient testing of ecological and health effects. In the past year, major supermarket chains and baby food manufacturers have announced that they will refuse to use genetically modified food in their products.\nThe international \"life sciences\" group Monsanto, one of the most aggressive purveyors of genetically modified crops, recently announced that it was dropping plans to develop its \"terminator\" seed technology, which would have made it impossible for farmers to save seed from one season to the next.\nIn Indonesia, NGOs like the London-based TAPOL and the East Timor Action Network helped pressure the government to allow an independence referendum in East Timor. Despite the Indonesian military's genocidal response, the overwhelming vote for independence stands as a victory for the East Timorese and the international NGOs working on their behalf.\nCitizen action groups play an important role in providing consumers with information about the behavior of corporations. One example is the stamp of approval that some groups offer products, such as SmartWood, which certifies wood that is harvested sustainably; Green Seal, which promotes environmentally friendly products; and the California Certified Organic Farmers, which certifies food that meets its organic standards.\nIn addition, massive consumer boycotts coordinated by NGOs have pushed clothing, shoe, toy and other companies to address the use of sweatshop and child labor.\nAs a result of the success of many NGO campaigns, there are a growing number of nonprofit organizations funded and controlled by corporate interests. Such tactics are causing confusion. Having observed the effectiveness of grassroots groups, industries are setting up front organizations that try to make use of these same channels of influence. Nonprofit industry and trade groups already employ four times as many people as environmental groups do.\nSome NGOs are no longer seeking to influence government or industry directly to achieve what they want. Instead they are providing their own solutions to social and environmental problems.\nThe Bangladesh-based Grameen Bank, which has tackled rural poverty by providing poor women with small amounts of capital, has sparked a micro-lending revolution around the world. Grameen loans, which average around dollars 175, provide small-scale entrepreneurs with the money they need to get on their feet.\nTo date the bank has lent more than dollars 2.4 billion, seen a phenomenal repayment rate of 97 percent, and made a major contribution in overcoming poverty and discrimination against women in many poor countries.\nThe vast majority of NGOs are not activist groups that grab headlines. Many provide low-profile but important education, health, and social services. One survey of 22 countries found that two-thirds of all nonprofit employment is devoted to such services as primary and secondary education, hospital and health care, income support and emergency aid and relief.\nWhile NGOs increasingly step up to address unmet needs, governments should not be allowed to shirk their social and ecological responsibilities by handing off their duties to citizens' groups and charities.\nThe writer, a researcher at the Worldwatch Institute, contributed this comment to the International Herald Tribune.",

    "text": "The Big City; Health Law That Exceeds The Need\n1999-06-10T05:00:00.000Z\nLAST July, shortly after Rubyat Islam, a 6-year-old girl, immigrated from Bangladesh, a blood test showed she had an abnormally high level of lead. In November, after studying the case, the city's Department of Health ordered some changes at Rubyat's home, a one-bedroom apartment in Sunnyside, Queens.\nThe landlady had to cover all the walls and ceilings with Sheetrock. She replaced the windowsills, the radiator, the moldings and the front door. The total cost came to $10,000, which have would been a small price to stop a child from being poisoned by peeling lead paint.\nBut in this case the work probably did no good, and possibly even some harm. Consider a few pertinent details:\n*Rubyat already had a high level of lead when she arrived from Bangladesh. The July test was taken several weeks before her family moved into the apartment.\n*The walls and ceiling had been scraped and covered with a fresh layer of unleaded paint just before Rubyat's family leased the apartment in August.\n*There was little, if any, lead even in the old layers of paint safely buried beneath the surface. The city's extensive tests throughout the apartment found lead in only a few patches of paint, and in such small traces that the readings could easily have been due to measurement error. An independent testing company hired by the landlady found no significant amounts of lead.\n*Even if there was lead below the surface, it would probably have been safer to leave the lead undisturbed. The hammering and other work during the renovation could have released lead dust into the air.\nWhat happened in Sunnyside was part of a curious trend that began in the 1970's, when lead was removed from gasoline. It was a great triumph of the environmental movement, leading to a steep decline in the incidence of lead poisoning. But while the problem has been shrinking, the solutions have been multiplying as more and more regulations are imposed.\n''There's a lot of exaggeration today by people who want lead poisoning to appear to be a terrible problem,'' said Dr. Sergio Piomelli, a professor of pediatrics at Columbia University, who was one of the pioneers in combating lead poisoning. His research during the 1970's found elevated levels of lead in one-tenth of the children in New York City.\n''Today there are just a few hundred cases in the whole city, mainly in certain areas with dilapidated housing,'' Dr. Piomelli said. ''We should be concentrating resources on them instead of trying to frighten everyone else. But lead poisoning has become a profession for some people.''\nLEAD-poisoning suits against landlords (especially New York's richest landlord, the city government) have become a booming industry for lawyers, who have joined with advocacy groups in pushing for stricter standards on lead. Because of a lawsuit won last year by the New York City Coalition to End Lead Poisoning, the city has been forced to reinterpret its 1982 law on lead poisoning. As a result, paint is now classified as lead-based even when the traces of lead are too small to be measured reliably.\nThe court ruling also requires all lead paint to be removed or encapsulated with plaster wallboard if the apartment is occupied by a young child. This new policy has been denounced by both the Department of Health -- which called it ''unnecessary, costly and potentially dangerous'' -- and by the sponsor of the original law, Councilman Stanley E. Michels.\n''It was never our intention in 1982 to force landlords to remove all lead paint from all apartments,'' Mr. Michels said. ''With these new regulations we could harm children by releasing a lot of lead dust.'' He and other Council members are planning to hold a hearing soon, possibly next week, to consider a more moderate law.\nIn the meantime, the lead-abatement crusade is complicating life for landlords and, ultimately, for tenants with children -- particularly children from overseas. What landlord wants to risk renting to them?\n''I've learned my lesson,'' said Rubyat's landlady, Rochelle Gutman. ''The $10,000 I spent on that one apartment wiped out the whole building's bottom line for the year. From now on, I may start screening tenants by demanding blood tests of the children. I've also been advised not to rent to families from countries with high levels of lead in the air. It's sad, but the city is pushing us against the wall.''",

    "text": "Time for Asians to Wake Up to the AIDS Menace\n1999-10-26T05:00:00.000Z\nAt least 33 million people are infected by HIV/AIDS worldwide. About 8 million are in Asia.\nThe HIV virus is present in all countries of Asia, where most of the world's population lives. Tourism and business travel, internal and international migration as well as political and social upheavals can help spread the virus.\nThere are people engaged in high-risk behavior everywhere. Some inject drugs and share syringes. There is commercial sex and unsafe sexual practices. In most countries the blood supply is not free of HIV and infection control procedures are poor, posing risks for health workers, patients and the general public.\nAIDS threatens Asia in a number of ways. If its spread is unchecked, it could reduce, halt and even reverse the region's economic growth.\nThe cost of treatment will put enormous pressure on public finances. AIDS patients require a variety of medical treatments as they cope with repeated bouts of infection and tuberculosis.\nLife expectancy will fall as workers in the prime of their productive years die from a disease that fatally reduces the body's immune defenses.\nBut AIDS threatens things that we value more than finances. It destroys families. It intrudes into the most intimate relations between people. It erodes our trust in each other. It devalues the basic right to procreate. It spreads silently, tearing at the very fabric of society. It is like no other disease. In a fundamental sense, it isa threat to national security.\nAsian governments must act now. Denial is pointless. In every country with a serious AIDS epidemic today, people once said: \"It can't happen here. We don't have the behaviors that spread AIDS.\" They were wrong.\nIndia has been fighting the spread of AIDS for almost a decade, yet it now has the largest number of infected people of any country in the world. Suppose that the infection rate rises to5 percent of the adult population. The government's public health budget could swell by at least 30 percent. Average treatment expenditure per year on each and every AIDS case costs more than educating 10 primary school students in India \u2014 without counting expensive therapies.\nIn the parts of Africa hardest hit by AIDS, life expectancy is 10 to 20 years lower today than it would have been. The worst hit countries in East Asia are feeling a similar impact. Cambodia, Burma and Thailand have already lost two or three years of life expectancy to AIDS, even though the majority of those infected are not yet showing signs of illness.\nSince 1970, life expectancy in nine East Asian nations has risen by 10 years or more. In South Asia, countries such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal raised it by at least 14 years. These are impressive gains. But AIDS can cancel and reverse this progress, with significant impact on the growth and size of economies.\nTo curb the AIDS epidemic and mitigate its impact, all Asian nations must put prevention and treatment at the center of their development policies and programs.\nThailand offers an outstanding example of how to slow the spread of HIV by enabling people to adopt safer behavior. Its vigorous program has included promoting condom use in commercial sex, a public information campaign about AIDS, and various other prevention measures. The number of AIDS patients in Thailand is one-10th the former level. Infection rates among army conscripts have halved.\nSuch achievements are a tribute to Thai government and civil-society leaderships, working together. But the lesson is also to act immediately. In spite of the prevention program's great success, the HIV virus has infected nearly a million people in Thailand.\nAsia has a golden opportunity to act early. So far there are no Asian nations with a \"generalized\" epidemic \u2014 where HIV has spread to more than 5 percent of the population. Three-quarters of the people of Asia live in countries or states or provinces where HIV/AIDS is not widespread, including many states of India, much of China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Korea, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Sri Lanka.\nAfrica and some Caribbean nations were not so fortunate. By the time scientists understood how HIV was transmitted, it was too late.\nThe writer is vice president for South Asia at the World Bank. This comment was adapted by the International Herald Tribune from an address on Sunday to the Fifth International Conference on AIDS in Asia.",

    "text": "Designs for Living in a Multicultural Society\n1999-04-03T05:00:00.000Z\nMuch public housing is both perfunctory and patronizing, providing adequate shelter and slight ease. Immigrant families, especially those from religious and ethnic minorities coping with a strange and often hostile environment, suffer most, but many of their problems can, with attention and at small cost, be solved, according to a report by the London architects Gregory Penoyre and Sunand Prasad called \"Accommodating Diversity: Housing Design in a Multicultural Society.\"\nBritain has 3 million inhabitants from minority ethnic groups, mostly in highly urbanized areas, and all of them, especially Africans and Afro-Caribbeans, have problems getting decent housing. Prasad says attempts at improving conditions are more intense in Britain than in other countries, in part because of an especially complex immigrant experience.\n\"The sheer diversity and scale of the British colonial venture is what makes it different. Britain's very long history of colonial entanglement is where it all starts. The more recent history of interchange is now leading to an extraordinary period where in this country there are real signs of a multicultural society, still fragile and full of danger.\"\nPrasad likes to say that his firm designs everything from opera houses to operating theaters but they are especially active in public housing for minority groups, working now on the conversion of early 19th-century houses in Stepney to accommodate immigrant extended families.\nTheir research has indicated that immigrant families do not wish their houses to stand out and prefer to avoid areas of high racial harassment. Statistically more vulnerable to criminal attacks, dwellings should be sited to provide maximum security, perhaps in a horseshoe shape so that occupants can overlook each other's entrances.\nLayouts should provide for, say, the Bangladeshi custom of several generations living under the same roof, or Muslim separation of men and women. Certain groups have expressed a need for space for a shrine and for ritual washing, many purchase food in bulk and so require more storage space.\nOne scheme for Afro-Caribbean older people in south London has added glazed, verandah-like circulation space to replicate the Caribbean relationship between indoors and outdoors in an unfriendly cold climate.\nIn bedrooms, Muslims do not wish the feet to point to Mecca, Kurds prefer a north-south axis, some Chinese will not have the bed face any door, including a closet.\nThe groups studied for the Home Housing Trust by Penoyre and Prasad and four architectural practices specializing in minority needs were African, Arab, Bangladeshi, Caribbean, Chinese, Filipino, Greek Cypriot, Indian, Jewish, Kurdish, Pakistani, Somali, Tamil, Turkish, Turkish Cypriot, Vietnamese and West African. Religions involved ranged from Copt to Zoroastrian, languages from Hakka to Twi.\nThe point was to provide comfort now as well as flexibility so that the housing will remain suitable as customs become more integrated or neighborhoods change.\nFor now, many of the suggestions are quite specific. For people who prefer to sit on the floor, lower window sills to provide light. White worktops should be avoided in the kitchen because they are easily stained by the turmeric that is used widely in many cuisines. Smoke-detector alarms should be carefully placed so that they are not set off when incense is burned. Private outdoor space such as balconies can be used for sun-drying popadams.\nThe last suggestion, Prasad says, caused much merriment in the press when the second edition of the report was released during the summer silly season. Some immigrants hotly denied any interest in popadams and found the suggestion patronizing. \"It is far from patronizing, it is largely directed by the people involved,\" Prasad says. Others criticized what they considered a ghetto approach.\n\"This is the very reverse of ghettoizing. This is to say let's look at all housing, we think that all housing can be improved by taking a more generous view of the lifestyle that may be accommodated in that housing.\" The idea is that, with small changes, a native-born English family could, when the original occupants have moved on, feel equally at home.\n\"We're not talking only about specific solutions for minority ethnic groups, but this point is hard to get across. People say you want to design special buildings and then we'll all be separate, but this isn't the message at all. Take disabilities, it's now totally established that we should make buildings accessible for people with disabilities and this has had only one effect on housing, it's made it more generous and better. Doorways are wider, there's room to swing a cat, the nicest loos to use are those designed for disabilities, don't you always go for them?\"\nThe Vietnamese shrine can always later become a bookcase, large-family homes can be divided as demographics change, showers with constantly running water rather than stagnant bathtubs already suit current tastes.\nPrasad, whose early years were spent in Gandhi's ashram in central India and who came to England as a schoolboy 35 years ago when his father took a job with an international pacifist group, says England has changed a great deal in his lifetime. \"It was far, far worse, I've seen some very bad things, I've personally suffered from racism and violence as well, but I think that given the way human history moves you have to accept some of these things for a fact, and a lot of things are getting better. There is more transparency, a lot of discussion, booklets like ours can come out.\"\nBut as the booklet reminds us, a lot remains to be done. One detail: The letter flaps traditional on English front doors are not recommended for minority housing because excreta and gasoline-soaked rags are often shoved through them.\nSince the first edition of the booklet came out in 1993, its recommendations, although simple and cost-effective, have not been taken forward by other architects, Prasad admits. Yet the adaptation of local housing to the habits of outsiders is older even than the British Raj.\nEarly English settlers in Bengal adapted the local one-story cottage to their own needs and tastes. The new house form took its name in 1676 from bangla, or belonging to Bengal, and it was enduringly called the bungalow.",

    "text": "Afghanistan's Record Still Poor on Human Rights\n1999-04-08T05:00:00.000Z\nDespite the apparent relaxation of some restrictions on women in Kabul, the United Nations special investigator for Afghanistan said today that Taliban officials had not moved to significantly restore human rights to the country's citizens.\nDr. Kamal Hossain, the former foreign minister of Bangladesh, presented his findings to the 53-country United Nations Human Rights Commission, which is meeting in Geneva.\nBased on a visit in March, Dr. Hossain reported ''continuing violations of and denial of human rights'' despite a lull in the fighting.\nDr. Hossain was appointed to his post last year, but had to delay his visit to the country because of the unstable security situation.\n''While they seek international recognition, they continue to pursue policies which are in conflict with international human rights standards by which Afghanistan is bound,'' Dr. Hossain said. The country has signed most major international treaties that commit the Government to guarantee human, economic and social rights to its citizens.\nTaliban authorities, however, recently exempted needy widows from the prohibition on employing women in urban areas. They also had expressed ''a more flexible attitude about girls' access to education, indicating that girls could return to school if more of the war-damaged schools were reopened,'' Dr. Hossein said.\nTaliban officials told him that law and order had been sufficiently restored for ''people to carry on some of their normal avocations: going to market, opening shops or having their children attend some of the schools.''\nNonetheless ''hardly any girls'' attend school and only 24 percent of boys receive schooling, Dr. Hossain noted. This is because, prior to the Taliban takeover, as many as 80 percent of the teachers were women.\nIn addition to widespread lack of education, food and health problems were also pervasive, Dr. Hossain said.\nThe health situation is equally severe, with infant and maternal mortality rates among the highest in the world, he said.\nTaliban officials, who had no immediate comment on the report, cooperated with the visit of Dr. Hossain, who is the third independent fact-finder assigned to Afghanistan.",

    "text": "U.S. Is Set to Monitor the Clock Shift From a Central Office\n1999-12-28T05:00:00.000Z\nIt does not resemble a bunker. Its computers have suffered the same routine glitches that computers do in every other office suite. But as the millennium approaches, two floors of a nondescript building near the White House have been transformed into command central for the federal government's response to Year 2000-related emergencies.\nThe Information Coordination Center, as it is officially known, will open for business on Tuesday morning. It will begin 24-hour operations on Thursday. By the time midnight arrives on Dec. 31, as many as 200 government bureaucrats will be in place on the 8th and 10th floors of 1800 G Street, along with scores of journalists, industry representatives and others.\nIf all goes according to plan, details of a sudden power failure in Bangladesh would flash across the computer screen of John A. Koskinen, who is President Clinton's Year 2000 coordinator, as would news of a run on automated teller machines in Bangor, Me. Cots are available in the center for naps. Coffee will be brewing at noon and night. Mr. Koskinen will provide media briefings from the center, and he will talk with Vice President Al Gore, who has been designated the White House contact, on a secure line.\nIs there a button Mr. Koskinen can push to start the A.T.M.'s working in Maine? No, the command center's goal is not to fix Year 2000 problems, but to gather information about such glitches and help coordinate the government's response.\nFrom the outside, the 12-story building is run of the mill for downtown Washington. Owned by private investors, it houses the Veterans Affairs Department on three floors and the World Bank on another three. Until recently, the headquarters of the Secret Service was there.\nConcerned about security, government officials refuse to describe exactly what devices the command center contains. But a tour today revealed a vast expanse of computers, walls of glass creating a futuristic command center look, and large TV monitors and world maps.\nIn case the lights go out, the building has two generators in the basement and a third one that had been installed for the Secret Service. The building is also equipped with a system to keep computers running if the power is interrupted, said Robert E. Carl, the building manager.\nCreating the center cost about $30 million, officials said. Operating it until June, the date officials expect to wrap up their work, will bring the total cost to about $50 million.\nBut the expense is necessary, Mr. Koskinen said. Although government command centers exist in the White House, the Pentagon and numerous other departments and agencies, none were appropriate for this unique situation, Mr. Koskinen said.\n''There was no other place in the government that was geared up to handle this volume of information,'' said Mr. Koskinen, who considers the Year 2000 conversion the greatest information processing exercise since World War II.\nA typical hurricane only concerns a handful of states, Mr. Koskinen explained. Even the bombing campaign in Kosovo was centered on a specific region, he noted.\nIn contrast, the date rollover could cause problems anywhere in the world. The command center will receive reports, filtered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, from similar command centers set up in every state. The center will also gather data from Year 2000 coordinators in 180 countries worldwide. Embassies and military bases will also forward updates.\nA test of the computer system at the command center about a month ago disclosed some glitches. But the computers passed a follow-up test.\nAfter a New Year's Eve trip to New York City to reassure the public that airplanes are up and running, Mr. Koskinen plans to spend most of his waking hours, and perhaps some of his sleeping ones, at the center. Despite the expense and work of putting it all together, he said he would be pleased if it did not turn into a beehive of activity.",

    "text": "NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: EAST VILLAGE/LOWER EAST SIDE; Long After Blackout, Merchants Are Feeling Overlooked and Underpaid\n1999-11-21T05:00:00.000Z\nMohammed Ali's dreams of prospering from the Bangladeshi-Indian grocery he bought in April began to sour in July, he said. That's when his business, on the Lower East Side, was struck by a blackout and weeks of ensuing electrical problems.\nMr. Ali and merchants from nearly 20 other businesses affected by the blackout say they have suffered large financial losses from the disruption. But, despite corresponding for four months with Con Edison and others, they say, they have failed to get adequate compensation.\nMarcia Lemmon, president of the Ludlow Street Block Association, has been leading this coalition of businesses, mostly between Essex and Ludlow Streets and East Houston and Rivington Streets. She said the blackout, which occurred on July 7 during a summer heat wave, and the later electrical problems, caused damage to the merchants' equipment and loss of food and customers.\nBut there are complications in the merchants' quest for payment. On the day of the blackout, some Con Edison transformers caught fire in a Metropolitan Transportation Authority substation at 163 Essex Street. According to D. Joy Faber, spokeswoman for Con Edison, it was that fire that caused the blackout.\nMs. Lemmon said that on Oct. 27 she received a letter from Henry Brown, a Con Edison claims agent. He said that the utility was not responsible for the substation fire, and that all claims attributable to that event should be sent to City Transit, part of the M.T.A.\nRobert E. Slovak, a spokesman for the M.T.A., said the incident was ''still being reviewed.''\nMr. Ali and his fellow merchants must also contend with the rules for compensation from electrical interruptions. ''Residential customers can be reimbursed for food spoilage up to $100,'' Ms. Faber said. ''Commercial and other nonresidential users can be compensated for perishable merchandise up to $2,000. That is the limitation of the state law.''\nEveryone who has submitted a claim for those losses either has been paid or the claim is being processed, Ms. Faber added.\nThe merchants say these ceilings are too low. Mr. Ali, whose store, Banga Bazar, is at 179 Essex Street, said, ''I had to buy new compressors for my refrigerators and paid the electrician over $3,600.''\nJohnny Santiago, an owner of Torch, a restaurant at 137 Ludlow Street, said a power surge on July 23 had damaged his equipment, requiring him to spend $12,000 for hiring an electrician, renting a generator and other expenses, he said.\nBut Con Edison only paid for perishable losses. Mr. Ali received $2,000. Mr. Santiago got $1,100.\nMs. Lemmon said a Con Ed employee had told her and the merchants at a Sept. 22 meeting that Con Ed might pay more than its standard compensation if the problems were the utility's fault. But Ms. Faber said that was ''miscommunication.''\nDavid Flanagan, a spokesman for the Public Service Commission, said the complaints about compensation, along with others from the blackout in Washington Heights in July, had prompted the commission to review the payment rules.\nMeanwhile, Ms. Lemmon said she would persevere. ''We are prepared to pursue the M.T.A. or whoever is found responsible,'' she said.\nERIC V. COPAGE",

    "text": "It's Time To Help The Poor\n1999-11-30T05:00:00.000Z\nThis week, trade ministers from the world's richest countries will have an opportunity to make a major contribution to poverty reduction.\nThe World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle could lay the foundations for an international trading system that spreads the benefits of globalization more widely, creating new hope for the world's poor. Alternatively, it could extend into the next millennium a set of trade rules geared toward the interests of the powerful.\nIn the industrialized world, trade is often seen as a remote activity that barely impinges on everyday life. For many of the world's poorest people, it is, quite literally, a matter of life and death.\nIn Bangladesh, textile exports provide income for millions of poor women, income that is used to educate their children. In Africa, trade underpins the livelihoods of smallholder farmers growing tea, coffee and cocoa. In the Philippines, trade threatens the livelihoods of corn farmers facing subsidized competition from U.S. exports.\nPoor countries and poor people need a rules-based global trading system. Without rules the strong prevail because they have the capacity to inflict damage on the weak through trade sanctions.\nProblems emerge, however, when the rules are rigged against the poor, and the referee is wearing the colors of the powerful. This is broadly what is happening under the WTO.\nTake the case of textiles. During the last round of world trade talks, the Uruguay Round, the industrialized countries promised to phase out import restrictions within ten years. By now, they should have removed about one-third of the quotas under the Multi-Fiber Arrangement. In fact, the European Union and the United States have removed less than 5 percent of the restrictions. This translates into poverty and unemployment in countries such as India and Bangladesh.\nTextiles are the tip of a protectionist iceberg. While the industrialized countries preach the virtues of free trade principles, they remain unconvinced about the practice. The United States has been particularly adroit in slapping tariffs on imports it considers too cheap.\nProtectionist measures bite deepest in areas where developing countries have the strongest comparative advantage, notably agriculture and labor intensive manufacturing goods. Today, the average tariffs facing exports from the poorest countries to the industrialized world are about one-third higher than those facing industrialized countries.\nAccording to the United Nations, developing countries lose about $700 billion a year as a direct result of protectionist measures. This represents around 12 percent of their combined gross domestic product. It is also equivalent to fourteen times the level of annual aid flows to the poorest countries.\nUnlike aid, trade generates the self-reliant growth, employment and investment needed to tackle poverty.\nIn some areas the hypocrisy in world trade rules defies credibility. Take the case of agriculture. The average American farmer receives about $20,000 in subsidies each year from his government. This is part of a staggering $335 billion in subsidies provided by the countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Getting access to agricultural markets in the United States or the European Union is about as straightforward as leaving Alcatraz.\nBut when it comes to developing countries, the United States is demanding that the Seattle talks lead to more open markets into which American grain companies can dump domestic surpluses. In the Philippines, the dumping of U.S. corn is destroying the livelihoods of desperately poor farmers on the island of Mindanao. The annual subsidy given to American farmers is about one hundred times higher than the annual income of farmers in Mindanao, more than half of whom live below the poverty line. None of this deters the U.S. trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, from giving sermons on the benefits of level playing fields in agriculture.\nSo what needs to be done to restore the credibility of the WTO and create a system of trade rules capable of contributing to global poverty reduction efforts?\nThe Seattle talks could start with a trade barrier \"bonfire\" for the poorest countries, with the industrialized countries committing themselves to phasing out all barriers within five years. At present the 48 least developed countries account for 0.4 percent of world trade, and their share is shrinking.\nThe talks could then proceed to two key measures on agriculture. Export subsidies should be brought under the WTO's anti-dumping rules and be made subject to a ban. At the same time, the Indian government's proposal to exempt countries with food deficits from agricultural market liberalization to combat hunger and promote rural employment should be adopted.\nTextiles will remain one of the key litmus tests for the success, or failure, of the Seattle talks. The test itself is simple enough. Are the industrialized countries willing to do what they should have done years ago: namely, phase out the Multi-Fiber Arrangement.\nFinally, the WTO patents regime must be rebalanced. Access to knowledge-based technologies is increasingly vital for countries to compete successfully in global trade, but by increasing royalty payments to northern companies the WTO system makes these technologies unaffordable to the poorest countries.\nFor any of these changes to happen, the WTO process must be open and transparent. This is far from the case at present, with many of the world's poorest countries being excluded from the secretive \"Green Room\" consultations in Geneva. The challenge for WTO ministers in Seattle is to demonstrate the political will to set a new, more equitable, course for world trade that truly benefits the world's poor.\nThe writer is director of policy at Oxfam International.

    "text": "Beware, the Water All of Us Need Is Running Out\n1999-10-13T05:00:00.000Z\nAs the world's population reaches 6 billion, water in many places is being used more quickly than it is replenished. If that trend continues, it will have a profound adverse impact on food production and living standards.\nWater tables are falling in China, India and the United States, which together produce half the world's food. Historically, irrigated farming has been plagued with waterlogging, salting and silting. Now, with the advent of powerful diesel and electrically powered pumps, it is also threatened by aquifer depletion.\nUnder the North China Plain, the country's breadbasket, water tables are falling by 1.5 meters a year.\nIn India, the pumping of underground water is now estimated to be double the rate of aquifer recharge from rainfall. The International Water Management Institute, the world's premier water research group, estimates that India's grain harvest could be reduced by up to one-fourth as a result of aquifer depletion.\nIn the southern Great Plains of the United States, depletion of the Ogallala aquifer has already led to irrigation cutbacks. Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Colorado have been losing irrigated land in the last two decades.\nThe Yellow River, the cradle of Chinese civilization, first ran dry in 1972. Since 1985 it has run dry for part of each year. In 1997 it failed to reach the sea during 226 days of the year.\nDuring the dry season, the Ganges has little water left when it reaches the Bay of Bengal. India's people take the lion's share of the water, leaving too little for the farmers of Bangladesh during the dry season.\nIn Central Asia, the Amu Darya, one of two rivers that once fed the Aral Sea, is now drained dry by farmers in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. As the sea has shrunk to scarcely half its original size, the rising salt concentration has destroyed all fish, eliminating a rich fishery that once landed 45 million kilograms of fish each year.\nThe Colorado, the major river in the southwestern United States, rarely ever makes it to the Gulf of California. The fishery at its mouth that once supported several thousand Cocopa Indians has disappeared.\nThe Nile has little water left when it reaches the sea. Even though virtually all the water in the river is now claimed, the population of the three principal Nile basin countries \u2014 Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia, where most of the water originates \u2014 is projected to increase from 153 million at present to 343 million in 2050. This will generate intense competition for water.\nHydrologists estimate that when the amount of fresh water per person in a country drops below 1,700 cubic meters per year, the country is facing water stress. The number of people living in countries experiencing such stress will increase from 467 million in 1995 to more than 3 billion by 2025, as population grows.\nIn effect, these people will not have enough water to produce food and satisfy domestic and other needs.\nExcessive grain supplies that have depressed world grain prices in 1999 are partly the result of overpumping. If falling water tables were stabilized by a cutback in pumping, the decline in grain production would probably drive prices off the top of the chart.\nAs water becomes scarce, competition between cities and countryside intensifies. Farmers almost always lose. In North Africa and the Middle East, virtually every country is experiencing water shortages. As cities expand, they take water from agriculture. The countries concerned then import grain to offset the water losses.\nIt is often said that competition for water may take the form of military conflict. But it now seems more likely that the competition for water will take place in world grain markets. It is the countries that are financially strongest, not those that are militarily the strongest, that are likely to win.\nUnited Nations demographers are concerned that by 2050 the world's population could approach 9 billion. If the number could be held below 7 billion by better population control measures, water stresses would be greatly alleviated.\nIf the world stays on the current population trajectory, a growing share of humanity may simply lack the water needed for a decent life.\nMr. Brown is president and Mr. Halweil a staff researcher at Worldwatch Institute, a nonprofit research organization in Washington.

    "text": "The Trendy Discover NoMad Land, And Move In\n1999-08-05T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE fashionistas are on the move, this time to a neighborhood so anonymous it hardly has a name. On the maps in city taxis that show Manhattan neighborhoods -- Chelsea, Greenwich Village, the Upper East Side -- this area is conspicuously gray. Historically minded people may refer to it as Rosehill, after an 18th-century farm belonging to John Watts, a Tory sympathizer, that covered roughly the same acreage. George Trescher, the fund-raiser, who lives in the area, calls it Curry Hill, because of the many Indian and Bangladesh restaurants. Others call it NoMad, for north of Madison Square Park.\nThe neighborhood, which extends from 23d Street to 34th Street, between Madison Avenue and Second Avenue, possesses history. Stanford White designed the Madison Square Garden that once stood on Madison Avenue at 26th Street. (In 1906, he also died there, shot on the roof garden by Harry K. Thaw, the husband of Evelyn Nesbit, the showgirl who was his lover.) Herman Melville wrote ''Billy Budd'' at 104 East 26th Street. The 69th Regiment Armory, at Lexington Avenue and 26th Street, was the site of the scandalous 1913 Armory Show, where Marcel Duchamp showed ''Nude Descending a Staircase,'' and where Picasso, Cezanne and Matisse were introduced to this country. (''A bunch of lunatics,'' Theodore Roosevelt called the European artists.) To the average New Yorker, though, the neighborhood is unnamed, unmemorable.\nTo its newest residents -- who include Marin Hopper, the fashion director of Elle magazine, and John Bartlett, the fashion designer -- it's NoMad. Six months ago, Jason Weisenfeld, a vice president of Barneys, and Greg Winkelman, a vice president of Tommy Hilfiger, bought an apartment there. Antonio Prieto, an of-the-moment hairstylist, and Eva Lowell, an apprentice jewelry designer, moved into a place last month. Hamish Bowles, the European editor at large for Vogue magazine, is looking in NoMad.\nWhat brings the fashionable folk to an unfashionable neighborhood, where an occasional prostitute still hovers around the corner of Lexington Avenue and 27th Street? (At least the prostitutes are chatty, Mr. Weisenfeld said: ''It's always nice to come home late and get a compliment: 'Love your shoes!' '')\nWhat the fashion set has discovered is the real estate equivalent of a sample sale, in an enclave that Peter Lobo, a deputy director of the City Planning Department, called ''primarily middle-class.'' In an area where the last census found a per capita income of $38,590, co-ops, condos, and rentals are about two-thirds the price of those in Greenwich Village, SoHo or TriBeCa.\nAt 140 East 28th Street, a co-op building, owners have the real estate equivalent of an Armani suit -- at the sample-sale price. For the label-conscious, this 1931 structure is a Bing & Bing building, which places it among the city's finest prewar properties, according to real estate agents. A 900-square-foot one-bedroom apartment sells for around $300,000, said Nathaniel Siegel, a broker with Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy, who found co-ops in the building for Messrs. Bartlett, Weisenfeld and Prieto. An identical layout at 45 Christopher Street, also a Bing & Bing building, is $500,000, Mr. Siegel said. He sighed, then murmured, ''I almost don't want to tell anyone.''\nThe proprietors of Bing & Bing, a real-estate company founded in 1906, put money into each apartment ''because they wanted it to last for the least amount of maintenance,'' said Christopher Gray, director of the Office for Metropolitan History, a research company in Manhattan. Many apartments have 20-foot-long living rooms with working fireplaces and coat closets with built-in umbrella stands, a tray for keys and a mirror inside the door.\nLofts are being noticed, too. Last month, Mitchell Speer, a broker at William B. May, sold a 2,000-square-foot loft at 117 East 24th Street to Antony Nagelmann, a photographer, and his wife, Helen Faraday-Young, a fashion designer, for $700,000. ''A 2,000-square-foot loft in TriBeCa or Greenwich Village would sell for $800,000 to $1 million,'' Mr. Speer said.\nTo the fashion set, NoMad has splendors besides affordable rents and purchase prices. For Ms. Hopper, who lived in Greenwich Village apartments until two years ago, NoMad possesses secret treasures. First, there is the 2,700-square-foot 1910 town house that she rents for around $5,000 a month.\n''I wanted a house,'' she said as she scampered around in delicate turquoise mules with hand-beaded red and white straps. ''I wanted to entertain designers, people in the industry, friends.'' A diffuse golden light spilled through the the floor-to-ceiling windows on the first floor. On the pale cream walls were identical French mirrors, flanked by cream-colored silk Fortuny lamps shaped like cones.\nThe second floor has double living rooms, each with a fireplace and each furnished with a melange of mid-century modern chairs by Alvar Aalto and Hans Wegner, some woven of leather, some made of bentwood, all inviting languor. Every room has at least one mirror, usually antiqued so the reflected light shimmers but doesn't dazzle. The bedrooms are on the third floor. Throughout, the original floorboards are wide and burnished -- balm for bare feet.\nInside, on a hot summer day, the city vanishes. Shade trees shelter the front of the house; ivy tumbles down brick walls in back.\nTo hear Ms. Hopper talk about her neighborhood is to hear a rhapsody on food. Todaro Brothers, on Second Avenue near 30th Street, inspired a shopping litany: ''Amazing cheese, fresh fish, great roast chicken, fantastic bread and spiced tuna which I love, from Spain!'' Enthralled by the tuna, she ran to the kitchen and darted back, holding a glass jar as if it were a jewel. ''Ormaza white meat tuna,'' she said. ''The most delicious tuna -- in a glass bottle.''\nKalustyan's, a Middle Eastern food shop on Lexington Avenue near 28th Street, elicited another squeal of joy: ''It makes the best falafel!''\nAnd the restaurants. ''I love I Trulli, I love Tabla, I love Les Halles, which has great meat and a great free-range turkey for Thanksgiving,'' Ms. Hopper said. ''I order it to cook myself. It's the most juicy, amazing turkey, and they'll even make the gravy for you.''\nRestaurants of such variety as Pongal, which serves vegetarian Indian dishes, and Eleven Madison Park are no small part of the allure of NoMad. Park Bistro got there in 1989, and Les Halles in 1991, but Mr. Trescher, who has lived at 111 Lexington for 10 years, put it succinctly: ''God bless Danny Meyer.''\nLast year, Mr. Meyer, a co-owner of Union Square Cafe and Gramercy Tavern, opened Tabla and Eleven Madison Park. He chose the neighborhood for the same reason others want to live there.\n''There's green space, in this case Madison Square Park,'' he said. ''There is gorgeous historic architecture, and the rents are below value compared with the rest of the city. If you were trying to get a retail space on Union Square Park today, you'd be paying $80 to $90 per square foot, and around Madison Square Park it's closer to $40 to $50 a square foot.''\nIt is a neighborhood that is slowly gentrifying. The City Parks Foundation, a nonprofit group devoted to restoring parks, has raised $2.5 million for projects in Madison Square Park. Statues will be cleaned and waxed, more benches will be installed, and what is mud will become grass. Mr. Meyer contributed $60,000 toward the foundation's $6 million goal.\nAs in any area with an influx of upscale homesteaders, there are conflicts. The men's shelter at 29th Street and First Avenue is a cause of complaint from some residents, said Stuart Osnow, president of the Rosehill Community Association. ''That leaves a lot of people hanging around the neighborhood,'' he said. He is also badgered about trash on the streets. ''If you go to Murray Hill, the streets are spotless, but here they're not.''\nMr. Bartlett, for one, likes being anonymous in an anonymous neighborhood. ''It's not chic, it's not high-end, there's no draw here,'' he said. ''In the Village, it was very social. I'd walk out, and there'd always be someone I knew.''\nTwo years ago, he and Mark Welsh, a writer, drew up a wish list of the perfect apartment: top floor, terrace, fireplace. Months later, they moved from a rental place at Fifth Avenue and 10th Street to a penthouse at 140 East 28th Street.\nIn homage to the neighborhood, they and their interior designer, Alan Tanksley, painted the walls the warm, muted yellow of curry. The apartment is furnished with low-slung seating, without a single straight-backed chair in sight. In the glass-covered greenhouse that extends off the living room, cushions surround a hammered copper table. This year, they asked Eric Walton, an American designer who lives in London, to create a Japanese-style terrace, where a bamboo teahouse is set on a path of pearly beige stones bordered by larger black river stones. A tiny grove of bamboo trees is clustered in a corner. Sweetie, their black, tan and white mongrel, uses the meticulously designed terrace as a dog run, her paws clattering on the pebbles.\n''It's not where you live,'' Mr. Welsh said. ''It's how you live.''\nIf they need a design consultation, Mr. Tanksley is a few blocks away, in his 17th-floor aerie at 88 Lexington Avenue. He pays $1,800 a month for a 600-square-foot corner apartment.\n''I have big sky,'' Mr. Tanksley said. ''Straight out my window is the golden crown of the New York Life Insurance building, and golden light bathes this space at night. South is the World Trade Center. From one corner, I see the Empire State Building, and each night, I do a ritualistic good night to it.''\nThe Empire State isn't the only building rising above the neighborhood. The Madison Belvedere, a luxury apartment building at 10 East 29th Street that says it is ''just off Fifth Avenue,'' begins accepting occupants in October. Studios of 443 to 609 square feet are renting for $1,820, one-bedroom apartments of 583 square feet for $2,345, and two-bedroom apartments of 833 square feet for $3,054, said Jackie Dixon, a secretary in the rental office. Last month, 25 of the 400 units were rented.\nEven with the Belvedere bulking large, the neighborhood has a sense of community, and shopkeepers who provide old-fashioned courtesies.\nAt the Gurell Hardware and Supply Company, a 30-year-old family-run shop, Arthur Greebler takes deliveries for his neighbors. ''I accept U.P.S., Fed Ex,'' said Mr. Greebler, a lawyer who took over the business when his father died. When a customer needs him as a notary public, he doesn't charge a fee. ''He takes house accounts,'' Mr. Weisenfeld said. ''How genius is that?''\nMr. Greebler has heard that the neighborhood is getting more fashionable. ''There's a rumor that Heidi Klum, the bikini model, moved in,'' he confided. ''The U.P.S. guy said he delivered something to her.''",

    "text": "About New York; Images Show The Realities Behind Labels\n1999-05-22T05:00:00.000Z\nIVELISSE REYES once thought designer labels conferred instant status. Now she has been thinking about the status of the people behind the labels. She realized that some big-name labels rely on poorly paid, no-name workers to make shoes and shirts coveted by her classmates at Manhattan's High School of Graphic Communication Arts.\n''Why?'' Ivelisse said. ''Image is such a big deal. How you look. What you wear. Inside every one of us is some little vanity. We like to look good. We're just concerned about what we wear and we forget who made it and where it came from.''\nIt has become harder to forget, thanks to the images she and 41 other high school students recently created. With help from teachers and union officials, they visited several local sweatshops to find the grime behind the glamour. The results of their own labors now hang inside a gallery at the headquarters of 1199, the health care workers' union, which helped create the show.\nOn Thursday, as people packed the gallery for the show's opening, some of the students recalled the factories they had seen a few streets away in the garment district. The thought of one factory that Lisa Bertorelli visited made her grimace at the recollection of worn-out workers and decrepit, stench-filled hallways.\n''Down one block is Modell's or Nike,'' said Lisa, a student at Art and Design High School. ''Up the block you have a sweatshop. You see where the money is. Then you see the people making the clothes aren't making the money. Everybody comes here for a so-called better life. Then they end up in a sweatshop.''\nThe experience was not new for several students, who had met at the gallery before the opening reception. Clement Gomes, who attends Art and Design, reminded his friends that if they thought what they saw in New York was bad, they should see working conditions in his native Bangladesh. He recalled how in one town he saw workers sitting in an open-air pavilion sewing clothing whose spotless white fabric was in stark contrast to their own ragged, dirty clothing. Still, some of the places he visited in New York were unsettling.\n''It's incomprehensible to think something is made in America like that,'' he said. ''I have no words to explain it.''\nJust as difficult to explain for some of the young artists was the appeal of high-priced gear made by companies that have long been criticized for their overseas labor practices. Nike, a perennial target that has tried to respond to its critics with a series of reforms, was mentioned often for its Michael Jordan line of sneakers.\n''We're not buying clothes, we're buying names,'' said Analisa Biel, a student at Washington Irving High School. ''We're dumb for buying them. Everybody knows Michael Jordan comes out with the same pair of sneakers. Same style. Different color. Now they're coming out with a pair at the end of the summer that are just like the first ones. We had those when we were 11. Jordan doesn't care. Now he's making mad dough. It's all about money.''\nFranklyn Pelaez's mother, Gilma Paredes, understands that, since she spent eight months in a Brooklyn sweatshop in the early 1990's, sewing collars on blouses for 10 cents a dozen, 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. She had no other choice, since she was both father and mother to the boy, now a student at Washington Irving. Nor did she have any child care, so she took him to the factory, where he played with the fabric scraps piled up on the floor, bundling them together into make-believe igloos.\nFRANKLYN recreated that makeshift playroom for the exhibition. At the opening reception, his mother stood in wonder before his drawing, which he had stitched onto a sweatshirt.\n''This makes me remember everything,'' she said. ''Thank God, I don't have to work there anymore.''\nShe now has a better-paying job as a fur finisher. Franklyn wants to go to college and become a commercial artist. As visitors complimented him on his artwork, his mother only hoped he would find a good, secure profession.\n''I ask God each day for the strength to keep working,'' she said. ''I tell my son: 'Franklyn, look how hard I had to work. I don't want you to go through that in your future. You have to study.' He thinks I'm crazy. But he will understand later.''\nShe stood near Franklyn's study of her old workplace, a sad scene of cracked walls, cramped tables and weary faces. Every single detail proved that he understood her better than she suspected.",

    "text": "Landlords Around the U.N. Find Diplomacy Doesn't Pay\n1999-12-25T05:00:00.000Z\nThe minister of the Mission of Guinea-Bissau sat in his darkened office one afternoon last week, near a large window overlooking East 43rd Street.\nThe minister, Joao De Gama, was working alone in the seven-room office because the mission's staff, once eight people, has been cut, for the most part, to one: Mr. De Gama. He was working in darkness because the landlord recently cut off the electricity.\nGuinea-Bissau has not paid the rent in 15 months. Mr. De Gama keeps his cell phone handy because the office phone service has also been disconnected.\nThere was more activity a block away, at the Liberian Consulate, at 820 Second Avenue, as officials in suits paced around the 13th-floor office suite with cell phones. Again the office was almost completely dark.\nA secretary in one pitch-black room turned on a battery-powered camping lantern to tell a reporter that late last month, the building's management cut the electricity to the mission and consulate, which has not paid its rent in five months, an outstanding bill of roughly $50,000.\nBoth countries are getting over wars in their homelands and have interim governments that are not financing the missions. Landlords say this is not a unique situation around the United Nations. At any given time, several diplomatic offices are having financial difficulties.\nIn their darkest hours, the missions of economically wobbly, and often warring, countries often stop paying rent (and salaries) without permission. Those rules also make it illegal for landlords to evict tenants with diplomatic status.\nEven court judgments ordering diplomats to pay back rent cannot be enforced, so landlords apply pressure by cutting electricity, heat and sometimes phone service. So an African civil war can really hang up a landlord in Turtle Bay, the East Side neighborhood near the United Nations.\nLiberia and Guinea-Bissau are among 19 countries that have not paid their United Nations dues in at least two years. Liberia lost its voting rights in the Security Council, said Farhan Haq, a United Nations spokesman, but Guinea-Bissau has been allowed to keep its vote because of ''extenuating financial hardship.''\nPulling the plug on deadbeat diplomats is more problematic in New York City than in other parts of the world, because office space is coveted and expensive, Mr. Haq said.\n''Rents around here are very high,'' he said, and that poses a special hardship for poorer countries.\nIn 1984, Rwanda's new government refused to pay expenses incurred by its previous government, Mr. Haq said. And just before Zaire became Congo, the outgoing Zaire ambassador took some appliances from the mission and began conducting business out of his New Jersey home.\n''There is a real history of missions having problems paying rent and maintaining their facilities,'' Mr. Haq said. ''Desperate things happen during change of governments, but it's really between them and their landlord and the City of New York. Diplomatic immunity protects them from legal penalty while doing their diplomatic work, so we stay out of it.''\nMelvyn Kaufman, who is a part owner of several East Side office buildings, has had several diplomatic tenants that stopped paying rent but stayed in the offices, often without electricity, telephones or even heat. Mr. Kaufman has won various judgments for millions of dollars over the years, but has never gotten any government agency to enforce them, so he will no longer rent space to diplomats. ''We won't touch them anymore,'' he said.\nMr. De Gama of the Guinea-Bissau mission said that a yearlong civil war ended in his country in August, and the interim government had cut financing. With no salary, he said, he gets by using money from a modest expense account, but there is not enough to pay the $6,000-per-month rent, which includes utilities.\n''It's hard to tell your landlord he should wait for the rent because your country's having a civil war,'' he said. ''We didn't come here to cause problems, and we don't want to abuse our diplomatic security. It's embarrassing, but we have work to do. Where can we go?''\nThe mission's office building at 211 East 43rd Street is owned by Eastgate Realty. ''We can't evict them,'' said Robert Hinds, a vice president of Eastgate, ''so the only thing we can do is shut down their electricity and hope they pay. I tried contacting all the politicians, the governor, mayor, congressmen, the U.S. Mission. Nothing works.''\nChad, Bolivia and Mauritius are also tenants and constantly late with rent, he said, but they eventually pay up. And then there is Bangladesh, he said: ''One of the world's poorest countries. They pay like clockwork. It's unbelievable.''",

    "text": "U.N. Prepares Peacekeepers As Timorese Fight to Survive\n1999-09-16T05:00:00.000Z\nAs Australia prepared to land an international force in East Timor to restore order, a United Nations emergency expert was able to travel out of the capital for the first time today to visit the largest concentration of refugees remaining in the territory. He found them struggling to survive on rice handouts from the military.\nA tentative calm prevailed in Dili, East Timor's capital, in the hours that followed a Security Council vote after 2 A.M. today approving the deployment of a force of up to 8,000 soldiers and equipment offered by more than a dozen countries.\nThe force will go in with Council orders to end the violence that has raged for nearly two weeks and to safeguard the return of aid workers and eventually many displaced people driven from their homes by pro-Indonesian militias after the East Timorese voted for independence.\nToday in New York, Indonesia's Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas, said that the vote for a break with Indonesia could be recognized by the national Parliament sooner than anticipated. Its new session opens in Jakarta on Oct. 1.\n''We are looking at the possibility of holding the peoples' consultative assembly session earlier, but I don't know now whether that is possible,'' Mr. Alatas said. A decision to accept the East Timorese results would require a larger administrative role for the United Nations, which under a May agreement would run the new country until its first elections.\nThe 50,000 displaced East Timorese around the town of Dare, whose numbers are equivalent to half the population of the capital, six miles to the north, have no milk for their children or medicines to combat diarrheal diseases and malaria, the official, Kevin M. Kennedy told United Nations headquarters today.\nBut Mr. Kennedy, one of 12 United Nations staff members left in East Timor, found that an Indonesian Jesuit with contacts in the Indonesian Army had found a way to have six tons of rice delivered daily throughout the mayhem of the last week, to be distributed to people hiding in the surrounding hills.\nIn Dili itself, United Nations security officers, led by Brig. Gen. Razakul Haider of Bangladesh, have been able to return to their looted compound from their refuge in the Australian consulate. Today they discovered that some of the radios stolen from vehicles 24 hours ago had been returned and clumsily reinstalled in cars and trucks -- not always the right ones -- said Fred Eckhard, the United Nations spokesman.\nHuman rights groups and relief agencies now making plans to return to East Timor fear they will find evidence of many killings, based on stories told by refugees who have fled the territory, many of whom were evacuted by the United Nations to Darwin, a northern Australian port from which the military and relief operations will be launched.\nThe first substantive report of damages and loss of life may come from the Red Cross, which hopes to return to Dili as early as Thursday, officials said here.\nThe World Food Program is assembling a chartered helicopter fleet for food drops, and will also experiment for the first time with a ''snow-drop'' system by which 350,000 plastic packets of high-energy crackers or cookies will be scattered from the air over inaccessible regions of East Timor. The packages are designed to float to earth in manageable sizes.\nIndonesian officials, who arrived in New York at the beginning of the week bridling at the pace at which the United Nations had been moving toward a virtual takeover of East Timor, are now down to working out details for the inevitable transfer of power in the territory, which Indonesia seized in 1975 after the colony was abandoned by Portugal.\n''They clearly came here with a mandate to get this done, but they were testing the bottom line, which rapidly became clear,'' a Western diplomat said. ''They were pushing for a lot more than they were going to get.''\nMr. Alatas, the Foreign Minister, said today that his Government recognized that Indonesian troops in East Timor would be under international command, and would serve largely in an advisory or liaison role.\n''What we are going to discuss in detail is how the cooperation will take place,'' Mr. Alatas said. ''I don't think that the question of keeping the Indonesian armed forces in barracks is being contemplated.'' But, he added, there will be ''no combat role'' for them. If violence breaks out, he said, the troops of the international force ''are quite prepared for it.''\nMr. Alatas said that he and his Portuguese counterpart, Foreign Minister Jaime Gama, were also talking with Secretary General Kofi Annan and other officials about how much Indonesian civil administration would be restored to the territory in this interim period. ''Public services have to run,'' he said. ''People get sick.'' Water and electricity would have to be supplied, he added.\nThe Security Council resolution adopted early this morning, however, sets out some very specific tasks for the Indonesian military, holding Jakarta's forces responsible for ''peace and security'' in East Timor even with the international force there, until power is transferred to the United Nations.\nUnder the resolution, Indonesia is also expected to bring thousands of East Timorese back to the territory safely from West Timor, the other half of the island, which has always been part of Indonesia. Most of those refugees were apparently forced there at gunpoint by the militias, who have been separating out men and boys and may have been killing them or sending them to more distant locations on other islands, refugees say.\nWho ultimately controls the border between East and West Timor may be a key factor in the success or failure of the operation.\nMany questions were left unanswered by the resolution creating the international force, diplomats acknowledged. But the strong supporters of the British-sponsored resolution, led by the United States, which forced the Security Council to stay in session until the measure was adopted, despite stalling tactics and procedural delays by the Russians and others who had no substantive problems with the document, say that the overriding need was to find a way to end the violence, even if most of the other work is still to be done.",

    "text": "If You're Thinking of Living In/Woodside, Queens; A Polyglot Enclave, At First, 'Irishtown'\n1999-11-14T05:00:00.000Z\nWITH several subway lines -- including one, the No. 7, with 61st Street as the first rush-hour express stop in Queens out of Manhattan, service by three bus companies and a Long Island Rail Road stop -- Woodside is a place where people don't need a car, even though it's easy to have one.\nEasy transportation brought John and Angela Mark to Woodside from Manhattan's Upper East Side shortly after they were married some 30 years ago.\n''We spent more time trying to look for a parking space than dating,'' said Mrs. Mark. ''We decided to invest in a house because it had parking. We drove over the 59th Street bridge to the closest point that was a nice residential area with parking.''\nThe couple settled on a one-family attached brick house with one paved parking space in back, which they enlarged to two spaces when their son, John, got old enough to drive. Mrs. Mark walks the few blocks to the Roman Catholic Corpus Christi School where she teaches eighth grade. Her husband, a police lieutenant, and their son, now 21, use the cars.\nMrs. Mark prefers not to drive. ''I take the subway,'' she said. ''For people like myself, most of the things you do are in Manhattan, so you just take the train.''\nThe subway has been a draw ever since what is now known as the Flushing line opened in 1917, when a large number of Irish families moved to Woodside.\n''Woodside was called Irishtown because it was then 60 percent Irish,'' said Edward Fowley, former owner of a bar called Shelley's, whose family arrived several months after the subway did. The rest of the mix was German and Italian.\nWOODSIDE remains middle-class, but it is now more of a melting pot. In the 1980's, immigrants were primarily Korean and Chinese. More recently, most have come from the Indian subcontinent. There's also a smattering from Central and South America. Mrs. Mark said she also noticed an influx of ''upwardly mobile people who work in Manhattan and have discovered the bridge and the subway ride.''\n''People getting out of college and making fairly decent money, but not great money, are discovering they can maybe get a house in Woodside at a reasonable price,'' she said. ''Instead of sharing an apartment in Manhattan, they share a house.''\nOther than several co-op complexes, the predominant housing stock is brick or frame houses for two or three families. Homes sometimes come with a small yard and a parking space in the front or back.\nA typical two-family house has three floors and a basement, and sells for around $300,000, with a range of $250,000 to $600,000, said Robert Jhun, a broker at U.S. National Real Estate.\nThe housing market is ''very stiff,'' he said, with houses usually selling within five days.\nMr. Jhun, who came to Woodside from South Korea two dozen years ago, said about 70 percent of his clients were Korean or Chinese. For Shanti Modi, a sales agent at the Re/Max Team, about 70 percent are from India, Pakistan or Bangladesh.\nAs for single-family houses, they tend to be frame, detached or semidetached, Mr. Modi said, selling for $200,000 to $230,000. ''Some people who bought houses last year got a profit of $50,000 or $70,000'' after selling them this year, he added.\nRidwan Kabir, an agent at Century 21 Best, said many of his clients, who tend to be Bangladeshi, enjoy the rental income from a multifamily house because ''the house pays for itself.''\nMany rental apartments are within private homes. Studio rentals go for about $700, said Ana C. Chan, associate broker at Wagner & Kelly Real Estate. ''Once in a blue moon, you will get something for $650,'' she said. One-bedroom rentals start at around $850 and two-bedrooms at $1,200, she said. One-bedroom co-ops start at $50,000 and one-bedroom condominiums at $90,000.\nWoodside's housing complexes include the nearly 12-acre, 10-building, 6-story Boulevard Gardens, now a 960-unit co-op, which opened in 1935. Woodside Houses, a 1,357-unit public housing project that opened in 1949, has 20 six-story buildings sprawling across 22 acres.\nHigh-rise co-ops include the three-building, 663-unit Berkeley Towers, the two-building, 230-unit Skyview Towers and the most prominent, the seven-building, 981-unit Big Six Towers, a Mitchell-Lama project. (Its name comes from Local 6 of the International Typographical Union, one of its sponsors.)\nWHEN Big Six opened in 1963, the average price was $550 a room, with $22 a room in monthly maintenance charges, said Catherine Gregory, a lifelong resident of Woodside who wrote a book on the neighborhood's history. Today, a two-bedroom unit sells for $7,882, with maintenance of $520 to $620. The income ceiling is around $60,000. People currently moving in have been waiting four to five years but, at present, the waiting list is closed. When shareholders leave or die, the apartments must be sold back to the co-op.\nWoodside has a large elderly population, said Heather Strafer, community coordinator of Woodside on the Move, a nonprofit development group. In conjunction with Sunnyside Community Services, the group manages a complex for older people, Sunnywood Apartments. (It was rededicated last spring as the Kevin W. Mahon Memorial Residence, in honor of the founder of Woodside on the Move.)\nThe group was also behind the colorful mural showing scenes of Woodside under the Long Island Rail Road overpass at the 61st Street station. It was painted as a youth project in 1983.\nMs. Strafer called Woodside ''a homey place, and very family oriented.'' Like other parts of Queens, it suffers from the illegal home conversions that cram many people into space meant for a few.\nThere are half a dozen playground parks and frequent sitting triangles, largely formed by the diagonal paths of Broadway and Roosevelt Avenue.\nWoodside's first landowner was Joseph Sackett, who settled in the area, then known as Newtown, sometime before 1674. In 1826, John A. Kelly -- one of several settlers from Charleston, S.C. -- bought the 115-acre Sackett farm. The name Woodside derives from ''Letters from Woodside,'' a series written for The Brooklyn Times by Kelly's son, John A. F. Kelly. He was referring to the woodlands near his home.\nMODERN Woodside started taking shape in 1854, when lots were laid out in the southeastern section, then known as Winfield. The railroad came through in 1861, prompting Benjamin W. Hitchcock to lay out the streets. Development peaked shortly after the opening in 1917 of the subway's Corona Extension, now the No. 7, or Flushing, line.\nWoodside crosses two public school districts. District 30 includes P.S. 11, with 1,300 children, and P.S. 152, with nearly 1,500. Both cover grades k-6. On the fourth-grade language arts test given last spring by the state's education department -- whose scores were released earlier this month -- P.S. 11 received a ranking of 13th among 671 city schools, while P.S. 152 ranked 128th. Another District 30 school, P.S. 151, has 920 children in grades pre-k through 5. Its ranking was 216th.\nIn District 24, the schools covering grades k to 5 are P.S. 12, with 1,200 children, and P.S. 229, with 1,400. Their rankings were 141 and 86, respectively. The pupils feed into several intermediate schools, only one of which, I.S. 125, is in Woodside. The area has no public high schools.\nFour Roman Catholic parishes in the neighborhood -- St. Sebastian, Blessed Virgin Mary Help of Christians, Corpus Christi and St. Teresa -- have elementary schools starting either in pre-kindergarten or nursery and running through eighth grade. Annual tuitions range from $2,200 to $2,500 for parishioners and $2,500 to $3,100 for nonparishioners.\nWoodside's main shopping street is Roosevelt Avenue, where the el rumbles overhead. Irish bars and Italian bakeries share the streetscape with Korean delis and restaurants offering menus inspired by the Indian subcontinent. The newsstands sell papers in a dozen languages.\nA more suburban-style shopping area is centered on the Tower Square Shopping Center, at Northern Boulevard and Woodside Avenue. The two 1896 brick towers that mark the entrance were originally part of the New York & Queens County Railway Company depot.\nWhen the shopping center was built 10 years ago, residents saved the towers by encircling them with a human chain as bulldozers moved in, said Mrs. Gregory. A Pizza Hut now occupies the former depot.\nA bit west of Tower Square is 48th Street, a massive shopping strip in Long Island City. Nearby, traffic along the Woodside end of 48th Street is a major concern of the United Forties Civic Association, which covers an area of western Woodside. The noise and fumes are never-ending, said Dorothy Neary, the group's secretary.\n''I happen to live on 48th Street, which is supposed to be a no-truck street,'' said Mrs. Neary. She has lived there since 1928, when it was a dead end.",

    "text": "MUSIC; An American In Paris, Painting With a Saxophone\n1999-01-31T05:00:00.000Z\nSINCE the be-bop era, jazz musicians seeking a better life have landed with their suitcases on the shores of Europe. In cities like Paris, Stockholm and Berlin, they have found steady work, low rents, congenial audiences and a more hospitable racial climate. But for all its attractions, living abroad has seldom advanced the art itself.\nThe music Dexter Gordon and Bud Powell made while living in Paris, for instance, pales in comparison to their best American work. Why? One argument is that foreign audiences rarely challenge jazz musicians to push beyond what they already know. Another is that jazz can only evolve on American soil or, rather, pavement. Cut jazz off from urban America, with its racing nervous system and Afro-Latin rhythms, and it wilts.\nSteve Lacy, a soprano saxophonist and native New Yorker who has been living in Paris for 30 years, is an exception. Like the writer Paul Bowles, Mr. Lacy has been nourished by exile; he has made it his muse and, at times, his subject. He is an urban nomad in search of routes rather than roots.\nBeing an expatriate has diminished Mr. Lacy's influence on young soprano players, who are more likely to invoke John Coltrane and Wayne Shorter. But it has also kept him at a healthy remove from the rancorous disputes over the direction of jazz that have divided American musicians since the late 1960's. At 64, he has amassed a remarkable body of work, and he shows no signs of slowing down, with two new albums: ''Sands,'' a solo recording released last summer, and ''The Cry,'' a two-CD song cycle to appear in the spring.\nMr. Lacy left the United States in 1968 when he could no longer support himself by playing. Already a well-regarded free jazz musician and interpreter of Thelonious Monk, his mentor in the late 50's, Mr. Lacy soon became a prominent participant in the heady European experimental music scene of the 70's. He performed with groups like Musica Elettronica Viva (a new-music collective that included the American composer Frederic Rzewski), staged musical protests against the Vietnam War and began giving solo concerts, a radical proposition at the time.\nSince then, Mr. Lacy has distinguished himself as a composer of urbane, lyrical art music in which post-bop jazz and European modernism commingle. On paper this calls to mind the bungled attempts of the 50's at a ''third stream'' fusion of jazz and classical music; fortunately, Mr. Lacy is both too idiosyncratic and too laid-back for such impersonal formulas. Although he has not recorded for a major label since the late 80's (after six fine albums, Mr. Lacy was dropped by RCA Novus in a purge of jazz modernists that included the saxophonist Henry Threadgill), he has not lacked for recognition. A MacArthur ''genius,'' he has composed music for the French Bicentennial celebration on an official commission and he has written for the Kronos Quartet. With the bassist Jean-Jacques Avenal and the drummer Jon Betsch, he leads one of the finest working trios in jazz. The weirdly beautiful, buglelike tone of his soprano has grown so lucid that he might as well be writing or painting with sound. In a sense, he is.\n''About 75 percent of what I write is inspired by literature and painting,'' Mr. Lacy said during an interview last fall at the Museum of Modern Art, where he had come to see the Jackson Pollock retrospective. Since the late 60's, when he began writing for his collaborator and wife, the Swiss vocalist Irene Aebi, he has set to music poems by Samuel Beckett, Osip Mandelstam and Robert Creeley, among others. Even when he's not writing vocal music, he often has a specific text in mind.\nFrom painters, he explained: ''I've learned how to improvise, how to let things emerge from play. The last time I walked into the permanent collection at MOMA, there were four Kandinskys from 1909 that I'd never seen before. They were pure improvisations.''\nTo discuss music with Mr. Lacy is to invite a swirl of references to other artists, including Paul Klee and Duke Ellington, Bach and Merce Cunningham, Brion Gysin and Bob Thompson. It's his way of crediting his sources, while also defining the context in which he feels his work ought to be appreciated. Mr. Lacy's outlook was formed by the New York bohemian scene of the late 50's. In his youth, jazz musicians, action painters and beat poets caroused at clubs like the Five Spot and saw one another's work as part of the same revolution of the imagination. If you didn't think that art could change the world, you had no business calling yourself an artist.\nMr. Lacy has remained true to this heroic credo, which gives him and his music a sweetly nostalgic air. A tall, graceful hipster with a taste for loose-fitting, modish suits, he shapes his sentences, like his improvisations, unhurriedly, with a sense of surprise and pleasure over how they turn out. Many of his tunes -- he has written several hundred -- are portraits of his favorite musicians, writers and painters (often personal friends), including Stravinsky, Max Roach, Jimi Hendrix and Kenneth Noland. (Their pictures appear at the bottom of his beautifully drawn charts.) It's tempting to see these homages as Mr. Lacy's effort to create an imaginary republic of like-minded artists -- a home for an expatriate.\nThe themes of place, belonging and identity are at the heart of Mr. Lacy's most recent records. ''Sands,'' which is named after a Beckett poem, is a stark, elegiac meditation on the performer's Jewish identity or, more precisely, his disconnection from it. (His name was Lackritz until 1952 when he was, as he puts it, ''christened'' Lacy by his boss, the band leader Rex Stewart.) When John Zorn invited him to record ''Sands'' for his Radical Jewish Culture Series, Mr. Lacy composed a companion piece to George Perec's essay, ''Ellis Island,'' in which the French novelist characterized his Jewishness as ''a question, a throwing into question, a floating, an anxiety.''\nMr. Lacy, who calls himself a ''Jewgitive,'' said: ''Perec talks about this break, this feeling of having no continuity with your parents' history. It's like somebody put a suit on you that you didn't buy, and it's not your style. I had to find my own style, and I found it in jazz and the arts.''\nWhere some Jewish jazz musicians infuse their work with Yiddish accents that all but disappeared several generations ago, Mr. Lacy rejects such sentimental acts of ethnic recovery. On ''Sands'' he wrestles with the question of his identity against a void, denying himself the consolations of a rhythm section. (On two of the tracks, Mr. Lacy plays his instrument into a piano with his foot on the sustaining pedal, producing a richly baleful echo.) And while the plaintive mood of ''Sands'' may carry faint echoes of the shtetl, it has far more in common with the stately red-and-white canvas on the album's cover by Mark Rothko, like Mr. Lacy a deracinated Jewish modernist.\n''The Cry'' is also haunted by a powerful sense of displacement, only here it is cruelly literal. In the Sept. 12, 1994, issue of The New Yorker, Mr. Lacy read a poem called ''Happy Marriage'' by the Bangladeshi feminist Taslima Nasrin, who had been placed under a fatwa for her criticisms of the Koran. (On a recent return to Bangladesh to take care of her ailing mother, Ms. Nasrin had to go into hiding, where she remains.) The poem begins, ''My life/ like a sandbar, has been taken over by a monster of a man'' and grows even bleaker.\nMr. Lacy recalled: 'I experienced a kind of shock, and nearly all my work begins with a shock, something that moves or upsets me. Irene had been interested in finding some mature women's poems, and she asked me to set 'Happy Marriage' to music. I said, 'How can you sing this? It's too strong!' But then I sat down at the piano, and it started going by itself.''\nA year later, while living in Berlin as a guest of the German Government, Mr. Lacy and Ms. Aebi discovered that Ms. Nasrin occupied an apartment just a few floors above them. They became friends. ''Taslima showed us more of her poems,'' said Mr. Lacy, ''and Irene said, 'Let's make an opera.' I called it 'The Cry' because it was a cry from a woman, a cry of oppression, of despair.''\nMr. Lacy's 40-page score for ''The Cry,'' which he calls a ''jam opera'' because it involves extensive improvisation, is written for an unusual ensemble of harpsichord, accordion, bass, percussion, two reeds and voice. The music swings, but the seductive, vaguely menacing sonorities are classical ones, inviting comparison with cabaret-influenced chamber pieces like Pierre Boulez's ''Marteau Sans Maitre.'' The original idea was to have Ms. Nasrin reciting on stage, but tensions broke out between her and Ms. Aebi, the vocalist. (''It was like having two queens on stage,'' Mr. Lacy recalled, chuckling. The women have since made up.) Without Ms. Nasrin, ''The Cry'' is a vehicle for Ms. Aebi, whose heavily accented, rather muffled delivery is not to everyone's liking. Still, when Ms. Aebi sings Ms. Nasrin's acid protest against patriarchy, there's no denying her commitment to the material or her acute understanding of it.\nMr. Lacy hopes to bring ''The Cry'' to the Brooklyn Academy of Music or Merkin Concert Hall sometime next year. He and Ms. Aebi are also considering moving to New York once their lease runs out in 2000. ''Nothing's happening in Paris except soccer,'' he grumbled. ''Soccer is happening; soccer is solid. But that's it, baby.'' New York, meanwhile, is beginning to look more promising to Mr. Lacy. ''Ten years ago, it looked like the giants were dead, and the midgets had taken over,'' he said. ''Now I'm more optimistic. I admire what Dave Douglas is doing, and I've begun to play with Danilo Perez, who really understands my tunes.''\nStill, Mr. Lacy has no immediate plans to return home. ''Everything I've done, I've done because I've heard the call,'' he said. ''When I first heard Sidney Bechet, it was a call. It's my own voice calling me, the call that led to my calling. So I'll know when it's time to go back.'' Until then, he said, he will remain ''an unassimilated American in Paris.''",

    "text": "PUBLIC LIVES; Being Privileged Can Take a Lot of Trouble\n1999-05-20T05:00:00.000Z\nOSTENSIBLY Marina Rust is another pretty young thing being honored for good works by a charity tonight in hopes that the charity, the Henry Street Settlement, will attract more P.Y.T.'s and their money. It's a good bet: In the junior committee world of in-training society doyennes that encompasses 25 blocks of the Upper East Side, Ms. Rust has, for now, broken out ahead in the cashmere-sweater set.\nBut calling Ms. Rust, the granddaughter of Marshall Field 3d, a pretty young thing is really the end of her story. Her past is in fact so exotic, startling and sad that it provided her with voluminous material for a novel, the largely autobiographical ''Gatherings,'' published by Simon & Schuster in 1993.\n''Someone once told me, 'Marina, the problem is, you've been so sheltered,' '' Ms. Rust said, dryly, in her small but Mark Hampton-decorated Upper East Side apartment, where a John Singer Sargent portrait of her grandfather hangs in the entrance.\n''There's usually a Sargent there,'' Ms. Rust said, pointing to a seascape in the living room, ''but it's on loan to the National Gallery.''\nThe point here is that after a decade in New York, with her own foundation and connections uptown and downtown, Ms. Rust, 34, has of late forged a distinctive profile for herself -- a quirky heiress, much photographed, who gives her money to inner-city literacy programs and who wrote the ''She's Gotta Have It'' column about her shopping obsessions for Vogue.\n(It was after all her great-great grandfather, Marshall Field, the founder of the department store, who coined the phrase, ''Give the Lady What She Wants.'' )\n''I think that love of retail is somewhere in the blood,'' said Ms. Rust, who has a sense of humor and the manners of a debutante. She looks like everyone would like to.\nOn Tuesday, Ms. Rust talked for two hours about society, her novel, her philanthropy and her mother, Fiona, Marshall Field 3d's daughter, the inspiration for the mother in ''Gatherings,'' who died in the book. Ms. Rust's real mother is in contrast very much alive, living in France and married to her fourth husband, Jean Kay, who served time in prison for trying to hijack a plane at Orly Airport in 1971, saying he wanted it to carry medical supplies to refugees in Bangladesh.\n''It was much easier to have the mother dead in the book,'' Ms. Rust said. ''If I was going to write something about my mother, it would take several volumes.''\nDoes Ms. Rust like her stepfather?\nShe pondered. ''How about, 'I don't know him'?'' she said. ''They don't come to the United States. He's not allowed in the United States.''\nThe tale begins in Washington, where Ms. Rust's father, David, was curator of French painting at the National Gallery. Ms. Rust's parents split when she was about 18 months old, and by the time she was 4 she found herself living in a trailer outside of Greenville, Miss., where her mother had gone to teach for Head Start. ''She felt like she wasn't contributing,'' Ms. Rust said.\nNEXT stop with her mother was a neighborhood next to Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco, where the two lived for about a year in 1969. What was her mother doing there? ''Drugs,'' said Ms. Rust lightly, then smiled. ''Whoops.''\nBy 1970 Ms. Rust's mother and her 5-year-old daughter were living on a commune in Oregon, where Ms. Rust rode a pony, played with goats and didn't attend school for her last year there, when she was 9. Her mother had pulled her out, saying, Ms. Rust recalled, that ''if you stay in that school, all you'll care about by the time you graduate are cars, clothes and boys.' ''\nThere are pictures of this period, disorganized in an otherwise neat apartment, but Ms. Rust managed to find a snapshot of herself on the commune, shirtless. ''I like that one because I'm actually wallowing in dirt,'' Ms. Rust said.\nClearly there are no little round white collars in this childhood. ''Oh, I have those pictures, too,'' said Ms. Rust. ''That's when I would go home to visit my father. That's why not only my pictures are mixed up.''\nAround the time of the no-school year, ''there was a bit of a custody battle,'' as Ms. Rust delicately puts it, ''but I made the choice.'' At 9, she went to live with her father in Georgetown, in a bedroom with pink roses on the wallpaper, done by Mark Hampton, of course. ''And I liked it very much,'' Ms. Rust said. ''I liked roses.''\nMs. Rust proceeded through the National Cathedral School, boarding school at Westminster in Simsbury, Conn., and then Duke University, where she majored in art history and was in the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority with Brooke Douglas de Ocampo, her friend on the New York social circuit. She wrote her novel in Durham, N.C., moved to New York, went to parties, shopped, started writing for Vogue (where she is now a contributing editor), gave away money and worked on junior benefit committees.\nThis fall she plans to marry Ian Connor, an investment banker at Lazard Freres, whom she met on a blind date in 1998. Ms. Rust's plans are children, books, charities, a country house. She says she talks to her mother twice a week and gets along with her, but has been more relaxed since she finished her book.\n''I think I've rebelled in the usual ways,'' Ms. Rust said, acknowledging that she ended up where her mother began. ''I sort of wanted the life she ran away from.''",

    "text": "Food; Fire and Rice\n1999-08-29T05:00:00.000Z\nFire is the ever-present variable in the calculus between the raw and the cooked. It dictates whether food will be done to a fine turn or charred to an ash.\nLearning to play with fire is like learning to dance with the kitchen gods. By varying fire's milieu, using it either directly (as in grilling) or indirectly (as in boiling or frying), the cook modulates its effect. A good cook is someone who knows how to temper fire through a balance of instinct and practice. The best chefs, of course, understand the limits of human control over the elements.\nConsider the case of fire and risotto. Unleash heat directly into liquid and Arborio rice and eventually you'll be looking at a pasty mess. On the other hand, if you first heat the rice in a soupcon of butter or oil, its grains will toast and thereafter absorb hot liquid differently, each one remaining discrete but tender while its mass becomes creamy and divine.\nToasting grain in oil or butter is a form of dry heat, since no liquid -- be it wine, water or stock -- is used. This method lightly seals the exterior layer of the grain, which can, nevertheless, still absorb ambient heat and release its internal moisture. Then when hot broth, wine or water is added, each grain seems to cook as much from the inside out as from the outside in.\nWhile no other grain will reward skillful fire play in the same way as risotto rice, most will become better than imaginable under the ''toast first, bathe later'' regime. Different sorts of rice -- the fragrant kalijira from Bangladesh as well as the short-grained red rice of Bhutan -- tend to become glutinous and dowdy when boiled or steamed. But pan-toast rice before adding hot water or broth, and each grain will wear its distinction proudly, with the dish as a whole achieving a full, nutty fragrance.\nBulgur wheat is another grain that can turn into a glob of sloppy starch or an arresting pilaf, depending on how it is handled. When simply boiled in water or broth, bulgur coarsens into a brownish version of cream-of-wheat cereal. But toast the rough-cut grain in olive oil and then allow it to absorb chicken stock a little at a time, and the nutty quality of the wheat blooms. Cooked this way, bulgur can serve as a full main course or, along with grilled food, as a replacement for pasta, rice or potatoes.\nQuinoa also needs a tender touch. This grain can become both mushy and rather bitter when boiled, but lightly browned in butter and slowly hydrated with boiling broth, it develops a hint of almond and a smooth, buttery flavor. Unlike risotto, which takes on a creamy sheen when stirred vigorously, most other grains evolve into sticky, starchy clumps if they are stirred as if there were no tomorrow.\nA smart cook, having channeled the fire and varied its effects first through oil and then liquid, will soon glean the benefits of the judicious fork. Stirring lightly and fluffing, rather than beating the grain as it cooks, is an art in itself. It also provides heat of a different kind. Call it elbow grease lite, if you will. But in the kitchen, it always works.\nBulgur-Wheat Risotto\n5 cups low-sodium or homemade chicken stock\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1 medium onion, diced\n2 cups bulgur wheat\n3/4 cup dry white wine\n3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.\n1. Place the stock in a pan and keep just below a simmer over low heat. In a risotto pan (or a heavy, deep skillet) set over medium-high heat, heat the butter and oil. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until it's translucent. Add the bulgur and cook, stirring, until lightly toasted, 3 to 4 minutes.\n2. Reduce the heat to medium and add the wine. Cook, stirring, until all the liquid has evaporated. Add 1 cup of hot stock to the risotto pan and continue stirring until all the liquid has evaporated. Repeat with 3 more cups of stock, letting the liquid evaporate between additions. Taste the risotto to see if the bulgur is cooked; it should be tender with just a bit of chewiness. If it is still too hard, continue adding stock a little at a time and stirring until it is done.\n3. Remove risotto from the heat and stir in a final 1/2cup of stock, the cheese and parsley. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.\nYield: 6 side-dish servings.\nKalijira-Rice Risotto With Shrimp And Mussels\n5 cups fish or chicken stock\n3/4 teaspoon saffron threads\n2 sprigs thyme\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter\n1/2 cup finely chopped shallots\n2 cups kalijira rice (''baby basmati'')\n3/4 cup dry white wine\n3/4 pound small or medium shrimp, peeled and deveined\n16 mussels, well scrubbed\n1/2 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for serving\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste\n2 teaspoons chopped thyme.\n1. Place the stock, saffron and thyme in a saucepan and set it over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, lower the heat and keep it just below a simmer. Add the oil and butter to a risotto pan set over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add the rice and cook, stirring, until coated. Add the wine and cook, stirring, until all the liquid has evaporated.\n2. Add 1 cup of the heated stock to the risotto pan, and continue stirring until all the liquid has evaporated. Repeat with 2 more cups of stock, letting the liquid evaporate between additions. Add a final cup of stock to the pan, scatter the shrimp and then the mussels over the rice, lower the heat slightly and cover the pan. Cook until the mussels have just opened, about 4 minutes.\n3. Using tongs, transfer the mussels to a small bowl. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in Parmesan. (Add a bit more stock if the risotto seems too dry.) Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a bowl or divide among 4 dinner plates. Top with the mussels, garnish with chopped thyme and serve.\nYield: 4 servings.\nNote: Kalijira rice is available at specialty stores or by mail order from Adriana's Caravan, (800) 316-0820.\nRed-Rice Risotto With Cabbage and Pancetta\n2 teaspoons olive oil\n1/4 pound pancetta, finely diced\n1 small head (about 1 1/4 pounds) red cabbage, core removed, very thinly sliced\n2 cloves garlic, chopped\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste\n1 cup dry white wine\n2 carrots, diced\n5 cups chicken or beef stock\n3 tablespoons unsalted butter\n1 onion, diced\n2 cups Bhutanese red rice\n1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving\n2 tablespoons chopped parsley.\n1. In a risotto pan set over medium heat, add the olive oil and the pancetta and cook until the pancetta is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add the cabbage and garlic, season lightly with salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until the cabbage is wilted. Add 1/2 cup of the wine, cover the pan, lower the heat and cook, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes. Add the carrots to the pan, cover again and cook until carrots are tender, about 15 minutes more. Transfer the vegetables to a bowl and set aside.\n2. Place the stock in a saucepan and heat until just below a simmer. Return the risotto pan to medium heat and melt 2 tablespoons of the butter. Add the onion and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the rice and cook until the grains are thoroughly coated. Add the remaining 1/2cup of wine and cook, stirring constantly, until all liquid has evaporated.\n3. Begin adding the stock a cup at a time, stirring constantly and allowing the liquid to evaporate completely before the next addition. After you have added 3 cups, begin checking the rice for doneness; it should be tender with just a bit of crunch. If it is too tough, add more stock and continue to cook until done. When it reaches the desired doneness, add the cabbage mixture and toss gently. Remove pan from heat and add an additional 1/2cup of stock to the pan along with the cheese, parsley and remaining tablespoon of butter. Mix gently. Season with salt and pepper and serve.\nYield: 4 servings.\nNote: Bhutanese red rice is available at specialty stores or by mail order from Adriana's Caravan, (800) 316-0820.\nDuck With Cherry-and-Pecan Quinoa Risotto\n2 1/2 boneless duck breasts (about 2 pounds)\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste\n4 cups duck or chicken stock\n3/4 cup dried cherries\nJuice of 1 orange\nGrated zest of 1 orange\n3 tablespoons unsalted butter\n1 yellow onion, diced\n1 1/2 cups quinoa, rinsed\n1/2 cup toasted pecans, chopped.\n1. Score the skin of the duck, cutting deeply with a knife in several places, and season it on both sides with salt and pepper. Place a heavy skillet over medium heat. When hot, add the breasts, skin side down. Cook for 10 minutes, pouring off excess grease as it accumulates. Turn the duck and cook the other side until it reaches the desired doneness, about 10 minutes for medium. Transfer to a plate, cover and allow to rest for 5 minutes.\n2. Meanwhile, place stock in a saucepan and keep just below a simmer. Combine cherries, orange juice and zest and set aside. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a risotto pan over medium-high heat and add the onion. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the quinoa and cook, stirring, until lightly toasted, 3 to 4 more minutes.\n3. Lower heat to medium and add the stock 1 'cup at a time, stirring constantly and allowing the liquid to evaporate completely before the next addition of stock. After you have added 3 cups, add the cherries and orange mixture and an additional 1/2 cup of stock. Cook until the liquid has evaporated. Test the quinoa for doneness (it should be just slightly crunchy); if it is too tough, add more stock and continue to cook until it is done.\n4. Remove the risotto from heat and stir in the remaining tablespoon butter and the pecans. Season to taste with salt and pepper and divide among 4 plates. Slice the duck thinly on the bias and fan the slices over the risotto. Serve immediately.\nYield: 4 servings.",

    "text": "Subcontinental Drift\n1999-07-11T05:00:00.000Z\nInterpreter\nof Maladies\nStories.\nBy Jhumpa Lahiri.\n198 pp. Boston:\nMariner/Houghton Mifflin Company. Paper, $12.\nA MARRIAGE is easy to start. Fate, in the form of friends, relatives or lust, arranges a match. But after the wedding, how do you stay engaged? Books are easy to start, too, and they pose a similar challenge. No marriage is as arbitrary and accidental as one between a writer and a reader, set up by a brief infatuation in a bookstore or the enthusiasm of a third party. Perhaps because of this congruence, ill-advised marriages have been one of fiction's most fertile subjects, ever since Squire B. abducted Pamela.\nSamuel Richardson's latest heir is Jhumpa Lahiri. Her debut collection of short stories, ''Interpreter of Maladies,'' features marriages that have been arranged, rushed into, betrayed, invaded and exhausted. Her subject is not love's failure, however, but the opportunity that an artful spouse (like an artful writer) can make of failure -- the rebirth possible in a relationship when you discover how little of the other person you know. In Lahiri's sympathetic tales, the pang of disappointment turns into a sudden hunger to know more.\nIt is a hunger the reader will share, because Lahiri's characters are charmers. Only a heart of stone would not go out to Mrs. Sen, for example. The 30-year-old wife of a mathematics professor, Mrs. Sen baby-sits and dices vegetables in gorgeous saris, the part in her hair properly powdered with vermilion. She is a formal, precise, modest woman, unsettled by only one thing: her unruly passion for fresh fish. Unfortunately, she does not know how to drive, and her husband is too busy to chauffeur her to market. ''It is very frustrating,'' Mrs. Sen explains. Lahiri ingeniously finds a story about the ferocity of desire in what this indefatigable wife will do for the sake of halibut.\n''Power,'' Emerson once wrote, ''resides in the moment of transition from a past to a new state.'' Like Mrs. Sen, most of Lahiri's characters move between the Indian subcontinent and the United States. They date, vacation, emigrate and work across cultural and national borders. In the parallax of this double perspective, a shattered jack-o'-lantern may obscure a child's understanding of, say, Bangladesh's war for independence. Obscure, but not erase: Lahiri's stories are rendered more powerful by the sense of cultural transition and loss. ''Everything is there,'' Mrs. Sen says of India, but her story begins with the fact that she herself no longer is. Lahiri's Indian-Americans struggle for dignity out of their element, like ornate shells left behind by the tide -- still lacquered and colored with the wealth of the sea, incongruous on a beach of democratic sand where the only decorations are patterns of drift.\nAs is natural for a young writer, Lahiri spends some of her time exploring the terrain staked out by her literary precursors. Like Carver, she writes about a young couple who have fallen out of love and are playing a bittersweet game amid the detritus of their life together. Like Hemingway, she writes about a tour guide who has more heart than the bourgeois couple who hire him; he is seduced by the wife's glamour and then appalled by her cruelty. Like Isherwood, she writes about an earnest young man studying his landlady, whose calcified habits at first unnerve him and then draw out his tenderness. But none of her stories are apprentice work. Lahiri revises these scenarios with unexpected twists, and to each she brings her distinctive insight into the ways that human affections both sustain and defy the cultural forms that try to enclose them.\nMY favorite in the collection is ''This Blessed House.'' The star of the story is Twinkle, a lackadaisical 27-year-old. An ambitious corporate vice president named Sanjeev has recently, rashly married her, because they both liked P. G. Wodehouse, they both disliked sitar music and Sanjeev was lonely. As her new husband soon learns, Twinkle cooks without recipes, leaves her undergarments on the floor when she gets into bed and feels no hurry to unpack the boxes in their new home. Her state of mind is ''content yet curious,'' which drives the methodical Sanjeev nuts.\nSerious trouble starts when Twinkle discovers a white porcelain Christ left behind by the previous tenants. Twinkle is charmed; Sanjeev, dismissive. The husband and wife are ''good little Hindus,'' as Twinkle teasingly concedes, and Sanjeev hopes she will get rid of it. Sanjeev underestimates the tenacity of his wife's whim. He is also unaware that in the religious tchotchke department, their new home is a minefield. Twinkle's discoveries of St. Francis postcards and Noah's ark light-switch plates multiply into a treasure hunt. Fearing for the dignity of his home, Sanjeev finally threatens to dispose of a plaster Virgin Mary on their front lawn by force.\nBut ever since Pamela wound Squire B. around her little finger, force has been no match for sentiment, however defenseless sentiment may seem. During the showdown, Twinkle wears a bright blue facial mask while soaking in the bathtub. ''I hate you,'' she tells her husband. Nonetheless, he insists on his threat, cruelly, until he notices that ''some of the water dripping down her hard blue face was tears.'' Lahiri is not out to convert Hindus here, nor is she indulging in sarcasm at the expense of sincere belief. But not even religion is sacred to her writerly interest in the power of a childlike sympathy, going where it ought not go. Blue-faced Twinkle has become the Madonna statuette that she is so taken with. She has breathed her own life into the Christian icon's plaster, not deliberately and not ironically but humanely, and she demands that her husband respond to this achievement with mercy and respect.\nLahiri's achievement is something like Twinkle's. She breathes unpredictable life into the page, and the reader finishes each story reseduced, wishing he could spend a whole novel with its characters. There is nothing accidental about her success; her plots are as elegantly constructed as a fine proof in mathematics. To use the word Sanjeev eventually applies to Twinkle, Lahiri is ''wow.''",

    "text": "Average Malaysians Ask:'What Crisis?'\n1999-02-05T05:00:00.000Z\nALOR GAJAH, Malaysia\u2014  It has been 18 months since Haris Aziz and his family began hearing the words \"economic crisis\" and by now one might have expected them to be feeling the pinch. \n Yet, on a recent morning, when Mr. Haris, 42, his four brothers and their younger sister came together from around Malaysia for a reunion at their parents' wooden stilt house here, family members said little had changed in their lives since the onset of the crisis. \n No one with a job had taken a pay cut \u2014 their professions range from banking to shipping to teaching to manufacturing herbal medicines. On the contrary: Mr. Haris's brother, Rahmat, 33, recently changed jobs because the bank he was working for did not give him a big enough bonus. \n The youngest sibling, Rozilawati, 26, was laid off a year ago from a company that sells locks. But that did not stop her and her husband from buying a 51,000-ringgit ($13,500) car a week before attending the family reunion. She has since found another job. \n Looking at Mr. Haris's extended family, one might be tempted to question the notion of an economic \"crisis\" in Malaysia. \n A year and a half after the onset of what was billed as this country's worst economic turmoil since independence in 1957, investors and corporate high-fliers have been brought down to earth. But the financial turmoil has been far from devastating for the average Malaysian. \n The unemployment rate hovers at about 5 percent, twice the rate of the boom years, yet the country has a million foreign workers filling jobs necessary to keep the economy moving. The official inflation rate is also about 5 percent, much higher than in most developed economies, but hardly hyperinflation. The value of both the stock market and the ringgit plunged sharply in the first month of the crisis, but now the currency is pegged to the dollar and stocks have registered sharp gains since September. \n \"If you're looking for a cataclysmic situation, you won't find it,\" said Jomo K.S., professor of economics at the University of Malaya. \"I think we have to recognize this crisis for what it is. It began as a currency crisis and it became a financial crisis and now a recession. Some sectors of the economy have been smashed. But most are doing reasonably well.\" \n Economists caution, however, that although Malaysia may have exhibited resilience in the face of the crisis, there is no telling how much longer the country can handle a deep recession. \n \"If the economy doesn't reverse itself by the middle of this year, you might start seeing some of the acute problems that our neighbors have,\" said Mohammed Ariff, executive director of the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research. \n Malaysia's economic crisis \u2014 like economic downturns the world over \u2014 is often calculated using relatively abstract economic data: industrial production figures, the rise and fall of exports and change in gross domestic product, a broad measure of goods and services. \n Indeed, by many of these calculations, Malaysia is facing its worst economic crisis in decades. The economy shrank last year by about 6 percent \u2014 a radical shift from the boom-years average of 8 percent annual growth. \n What is striking is how this decline in economic activity has barely dented the lives of people like Mr. Haris. He and his family say they are spending less and putting off plans for foreign holidays. But seen in the scope of their lives \u2014 and indeed an entire generation of Malaysians who grew up in poor, rural environments but who now live in modern cities \u2014 the crisis seems but a blip. \n Mr. Haris was raised by his grandparents, who taught him to plant a rice paddy and tend to the rambutan tree in the back yard. Today he is the human resources manager of the country's largest port. He has an Indonesian maid \u2014 very common among the country's upper middle class \u2014 as well as two cars and a house in the suburbs of Kuala Lumpur. \n And despite the economic crisis, none of that seems in jeopardy. \n It is perhaps a sign of the times that one of the most contentious political issues in Malaysia today is not the alleviation of poverty or unemployment, but an increase in highway tolls. Opposition politicians staged protests last month near toll booths just outside Kuala Lumpur, a modern capital that seems to belie all signs of crisis. Shopping malls are still bustling, and restaurants and bars in the city's trendy nightspots are still full, even on weekdays. \n \"These are things that puzzle a lot of people,\" Mr. Ariff of the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research said. \"Visitors to KL say: 'Crisis? What crisis?' The city is as active and animated as it was and people are just as busy. They don't see the crisis by looking around KL. When they go to Jakarta, they can see the crisis. When they go to Bangkok, they can see it. But in KL they don't.\" \n Many Malaysians say that foreign perceptions of the country are worse than the country's economic realities. \n That is perhaps partly due to the high-profile rhetoric of Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad, who often speaks in provocative terms of the destructiveness of the crisis on people's lives. \n Art may have played a minor role in creating a perception of misery in Malaysia. Kow Leong Kiang, a young Malaysian painter, last year won first place in a Southeast Asian painting competition for a work titled \"Mr. Foreign Speculator, Stop Damaging Our Country!\" The painting is apocalyptic: Three young children dressed in rags stand sour-faced in a blood-red field surrounded by sickly looking water buffaloes. \n But one would be hard-pressed to find such a scene of abject poverty and suffering in Malaysia. The country's resilience to the crisis, economists say, comes both from its relative affluence before the crisis and the large number of foreign workers who \"cushion\" the impact for Malaysians. As many as a million foreign workers have gone home to places like Indonesia, Bangladesh and Thailand since the crisis started. \n The diversification of the Malaysian economy is another factor. Mr. Jomo points out that damage to the economy has been concentrated in the finance, construction and real estate sectors. \n Demand for such items as computer chips and television sets remains relatively steady. High prices for major agricultural products have also mitigated the effects on the hardest-hit sectors. \n \"Certain sectors are doing extremely well,\" said Yeap Jin Soo, a partner at Korn/Ferry International (Malaysia) Sdn., a head-hunting firm in Kuala Lumpur. Mr. Yeap said the market for top executives among multinational corporations remained \"tight.\" ",

    "text": "Walking Wapping's Streets\n1999-11-28T05:00:00.000Z\nYour Molly has never been false, she declares,\nSince last time we parted at Wapping old stairs --\nASK many Londoners where Wapping is and what it is like these days and you are likely to get some contradictory replies. Even transitory visitors know the Tower of London and St. Katharine's Dock alongside: here, the elephant gates that once guarded Britain's imperial trade in tea and ivory guard a pleasure-boat marina, and offices occupy Thomas Telford's fine warehouses. But what lies farther along East Smithfield and Ratcliff Highway?\nThe answer is, London's traditional East End, which today conjures up nostalgia-tinted images of vanished poverty, but which was in fact the power base for much of Britain's past wealth. Developing rapidly after 1800, the East End became home for the best part of two centuries to a vast complex of wet docks. These, at their greatest extent, covered some 700 acres -- what the East End novelist H. M. Tomlinson called ''reservoirs of light brimmed daily by the tides of the sun.'' But this enormous conversion of land to water also converted the once-open farmlands and their scattered hamlets to a series of hidden cities, for each of the separate dock systems was surrounded by towering walls pierced only by fortress gates, built to exclude those without a right to be there.\nThe working docks have now gone, removed down the estuary of the river to the container port at Tilbury, and much of the water has been drained away too. But the East End geography the docks created, complete with many of the concealing walls, remains. This is why Wapping, one of the oldest stretches of Thames-side harbor, is a secret place still only hazily located in Londoners' minds. It is often confused with the Isle of Dogs dockland redevelopment (Canary Wharf and other futuristic towers) which is farther downstream on a much more pronounced bend of the river.\nThe best way to approach Wapping to get a feel of its many-layered past is to walk past St. Katharine's Dock and then turn down Thomas More Street for a quarter of a mile or so. The street twists and turns round the perimeter wall of the London Dock (second oldest, opened 1805), but behind this yellow stock brickwork new glass blocks have recently risen. Eventually a cobbled canyon of a street stretches promisingly to the left: you have reached Wapping High Street and the river. The first few tall, brick blocks are modern architects' versions of older ones that were destroyed in the wartime blitz, but soon you come to original warehouse and waterfront buildings, converted in recent years as dwelling space but with their high windows, their loft doors, and even their crane hoists still in place. Orient Wharf has a late Victorian ecclesiastical air, St. John's Wharf and Warehouses on opposite sides of the street are linked by their overhead iron walkways, now nicely painted. Aberdeen Wharf still awaits its rescuer, its windows dark with dust and emptiness, but farther along King Henry's Wharves and Gun Wharves shelter elegant apartments. The names here, like those of the side streets -- Dundee Street, Cinnamon Street, Brewhouse Lane, Java Court -- are a haphazard litany of the places with which Wapping once traded and the commodities that passed through the area, interspersed with names from a still earlier incarnation.\nOn the Thames side, the wharves descend sheer into the river, their timber shoring still soaked every high tide. Between them, narrow alleys leading to steps down to the water itself, ''stairs'' that are in several cases much older than the buildings that surround them. From the water level you can get fine views of Tower Bridge, normally seen from the other direction, of Rotherhithe's old church on the farther shore and of the whole sweep of tranquil water that is the Pool of London and which, well within living memory, was one of the busiest stretches of river in the world.\nA journey into the past of Wapping has, like a physical journey, different possible staging places. The London Dock shut for good in 1968, but well before that Wapping was a desolate, semideserted place, as if the war that had reduced some of its buildings to burnt-out shells had also imposed a spell on it. This seemed, fortunately, to protect it from the crass rebuilding that was the fate of much of the East End in those years. But the contrast between the abandoned, flower-sprinkled ruins I first knew then and the descriptions of the place from earlier in the century was startling. Here, for instance, is the journalist Walter Besant writing in 1911 in best proud-to-be-British mode:\n''The High Street Wapping . . . is blocked with wagons loading and unloading every kind of merchandise from the steamer wharves, while long lines of teams stand waiting their turn in the streets nearby. . . . The Headquarters of the General Steamship Navigation Company, the British and Foreign Steamship Company and others are here and the constantly arriving and departing boats allow no cessation of work.'' He adds that ''the present residents are mainly dockers or wharfmen'' and that ''the alleys and courts on the north side of the street are very small and crowded to suffocation.''\nIn Besant's day, the entrance from the river to the London Dock (59 acres overall, of which about 37 was water) was crossed by a swing bridge and guarded by Dock masters' and Customs' Offices. These have gone, but the fine houses that the Dock Company built for its senior officials at the Pier Head are still standing, having narrowly escaped the planners' bulldozer around 1970. Where the shipping lane ran between them is now a residents' garden, for these houses on the brink of the river, with a whiff of the sea blowing into them, are once again private homes.\nWapping has plenty of public gardens, though, in which you can lie on the grass gazing up at plane trees and feel glad that London is so much cleaner than it was in its days of mercantile supremacy. One of the pleasantest spots, almost directly opposite Pier Head, is the onetime cemetery of St. John's Church. Directly to the north of it the dock wall rears up again -- but it now shelters a sports center at this point. Once, you could have looked from here directly across market gardens to the Ratcliff Highway, for churchyard, church and attached charity school were all there before the docks came and cut Wapping off from Stepney to the north of it.\nAfter standing many years in ruins, church and school are now beautifully renovated and put to new uses. If you seek an operative Anglican church in the district today you have to go farther east from the High Street, with a dog-leg turn along Wapping Wall, past more fine preserved buildings: New Crane Wharf, Great Jubilee Wharf, Metropolitan Wharf . . . Then the road turns north, past a hydraulic pumping station (1890, red brick and terra cotta, now being renovated as a theater) over Shadwell Basin and so to St. Paul's Church on the edge of the Highway. Here the mother of Thomas Jefferson was baptized, and 18th-century shipmasters repose beneath worn, elegant tombstones.\nLet us go back another stage in time. Fully 200 years before the docks began to be laid out, Wapping was a ramshackle village that was established on the marshy riverside meadows below the ''cliff'' of the Highway during the reign of the first Elizabeth. Open-air wooden wharves were thrown up and stairs were constructed: they were then the means by which all goods came and went from the Pool. Wapping was a sailors' settlement, with the usual complement of lodging houses, brothels and inns, some of them kept by ''Virginia widows'' whose husbands had gone off to seek their fortunes in the New World just opening on the other side of the Atlantic. There was also a landing stage used to execute men convicted of piracy.\nTraditionally they were left hanging till three tides had passed over them, and their tarred bodies were then displayed in gibbets. The most famous of these was the Boston settler Captain Kidd, who in 1701 was in the pay of the British Governor of New York and may not really have been a pirate at all. ''Execution dock'' was approximately where the small Underground station now stands, about two-thirds of the way along Wapping High Street going east. Kidd's name is commemorated in a public house nearby, which was not in fact a pub in his day but which occupies some of the few remaining authentically 18th-century buildings on the High Street.\nIt is in the pubs of Wapping that we touch on the older layers of history. There are many fewer than in the past -- apparently 36 in the mid-18th century, one of them kept by the family whose daughter met there her future husband, the explorer Captain Cook. But the taverns that remain are genuine historical markers. The Prospect of Whitby, at the eastern corner of Wapping Wall, hanging right over the water by Pelican Stairs, is said to be the oldest in London. Here, drunk sailors would be robbed of their pay and pushed over the landing stage literally to sink or swim. These days the place is rather more sedate, and the landing stage pretty with benches and weeping willows. Though the present building is probably only 200 years old, an association with brewing and ale selling on that site goes back to medieval times.\nAlso venerable, wedged between two warehouses farther west at the top of Wapping Old Stairs is the Town of Ramsgate, which, under the name of the Red Cow, is thought to have been the pub where the notorious ''hanging'' Judge Jeffries of the late 17th century was captured while waiting to escape on a ship to America. A man who had once appeared before him recognized his face, and ran the mile to the Tower of London to alert the Governor of the Tower to the fugitive's presence. Still today this unobtrusive little pub would be a good hideout for, say, a renegade futures' dealer on the run from some City finance corporation.\nHere, in this quiet oasis near the heart of London, where ducks bob on the river, Bangladeshi children from the tenement blocks immediately to the north play cricket under the trees, and old bricks are expensively burnished, Wapping seems to be holding its breath. No doubt it is waiting to see what further changes of identity the future has in store for it.\nOut for a waterside pub crawl, and for a bite, too\nGetting There\nThe best way to get to Wapping is to arrive on foot from Tower Hill Underground Station (District Line and also the head of the Docklands Light Railway). Although Wapping does have its own Undergound station, newly refurbished, with a mural of\nthe steam trains that once occupied it, it is just a shuttle line under the Thames linking the East End with New Cross. (The tunnel was originally built by the great engineer Brunel, for foot traffic).\nYou can pick up the line from the Metropolitan and District Line at Whitechapel.\nOr take the Underground to the City's major train station at Liverpool Street, and then get the single-decker No. 100 bus that, these days, runs from there to Shadwell via Wapping High Street every eight or nine minutes.\nThe Pubs\nThe three waterside pubs mentioned all provide food. The Prospect of Whitby (open for drinking 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5:30 to 11 p.m., serves good bar food and also, as befits its status as the doyen of taverns, has a proper classic restaurant (dinner only is served on Saturday, lunch only on Sunday). Main dishes are about $15 to $25. (44-171) 481-1095.\nThe restaurant on the upper floor of the Captain Kidd has imaginative dishes including salads, freshly prepared, main dishes and pastas about $11 to $20, and a good selection of special breads. Open noon to about 2:30 p.m. and 6:30 to about 9:30 p.m.; the bar is open from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. (noon to 10:30 Sundays), and on summer afternoons barbecued food is available on the big cobbled deck overlooking the river. Reserve on weekends, (44-171) 480-5759, or for tables overlooking the river.\nOr, if you want something unpretentious and typical of English pubs these days, the Town of Ramsgate, noon to 11 p.m. weekdays, until 10:30 Sunday, will do fish and chips, steak pies and the like for $5 to $6.50, also sandwiches, lasagna, steaks. Just turn up.\nAt the other extreme, at Swan Wharf next to the Captain Kidd, is berthed the Silver Sturgeon, a river ship with silvery Art Deco fittings salvaged from the Savoy Hotel. She is the location for three-hour restaurant cruises on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday evenings at $90-plus a head, but they depart from the Embankment in central London. Information about these, and about special charters, from Woods River Cruises, (44-171) 480-7770.\nTobacco Dock\nIn your wandering, you may see signs directing you toward ''Tobacco Dock'' and a ''Pirate Ship.'' These are onetime storage vaults on the Ratcliff Highway side of the London Dock. The vaults were well worth preserving in themselves, but the attempt to turn them into a mass tourist attraction has failed, Wapping not being that sort of place, and the site currently has all the charm of a disused bus station.

The Administration proposed the amendments after concluding that the threat of a strike from an enemy like North Korea now justified constructing a series of ground-based interceptor missiles that could shoot down a limited number of incoming missiles. A1\nAccusation Against Diplomat\nThe Justice Department has accused Richard C. Holbrooke, President Clinton's choice to be the top American diplomat at the United Nations, of a civil violation of Federal ethics laws involving a business contact three years ago with the American embassy in South Korea, Government officials said. A3\nU.S. to Press Allies on Kosovo\nThe United States is planning to push American allies for a NATO ultimatum telling President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia that he must back down in Kosovo or face air strikes within days, officials said. A3\nBombing Plot Foiled in India\nIndian police said they foiled a plot to bomb American consulates in Madras and Calcutta with the arrest of a Bangladeshi man who has confessed to being a Pakistani intelligence agent working with an Islamic fundamentalist group that has sponsored terrorist acts. A8\nGuatemalan Addresses Doubts\nRigoberta Menchu, the Guatemalan Indian who rose from a childhood of poverty and racist violence to be awarded the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize, dismissed questions about a book in which she had described her life history. Doubts about the veracity of some stories she tells in the book, called ''I, Rigoberta Menchu,'' were raised in a study by David Stoll, an anthropologist at Middlebury College in Vermont. A8\nU.N. Frees $81 Million for Iraq\nIraq, which suffers frequent power shortages as power plants fail and electrical demand rises, will receive $81 million from the United Nations to buy electricity equipment, the director of the Iraqi relief program said. A5\nWorld Briefing A6\nNATIONAL A11-21\nWhite House Lawyer Challenges Accusations\nA White House lawyer accused House prosecutors of resorting to ''word games'' and ''legal mumbo-jumbo'' in their efforts to prove President Clinton guilty of impeachment charges. The defense, on the second day of its presentation to the Senate, focused on the details of the accusations. A1\nPat Robertson, the conservative minister who has been an important leader in pressing for the impeachment and ouster of Mr. Clinton, said that the President had ''hit a home run'' in his State of the Union speech and that the impeachment trial should be halted. A1\nMr. Clinton starred in two foot-stamping rallies, where he amplified the themes of his State of the Union address and attacked Republican proposals for across-the-board tax cuts. A19\nSeveral Senate Democrats said they might propose voting on the two impeachment articles early next week in another attempt to end the trial without calling witnesses. A15\nThreat in Social Security Plan\nRepublicans in Congress and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said that President Clinton's State of the Union proposal to have the Government invest a portion of Social Security reserves in the stock market would endanger the economy. A1\nDoubt Cast on Fiber Benefit\nA study of more than 88,000 female nurses over a period of 16 years found that women who ate a high-fiber diet were no less likely to develop colorectal cancer or polyps, which can be a precursor to cancer, than women who ate little fiber. A1\nRacial Study of Cancer Urged\nAn expert panel said the National Institutes of Health needs to develop a broader strategy for finding out why poor people and some ethnic minorities are more prone to certain cancers and less likely to survive them than is the rest of the population.

But because most upstate counties are predominantly white, a defendant in a New York death penalty case is far more likely to be white than black. Though whites make up only 21 percent of the state's murder defendants, they are 55 percent of the defendants in capital cases. A1\nScaffold Was Built Improperly\nA 700-foot construction scaffold that buckled and broke in Times Square last summer, killing a woman in a nearby hotel, was built improperly and was missing critical support braces on 10 floors, according to citations issued by Federal safety officials.

    "text": "32 Million Users, Nearly Half in South Africa, Predicted by 2004 : In Africa, Mobiles Blossoming\n1999-07-15T05:00:00.000Z\nWhile much of the world takes fixed-line phones for granted and regards mobile phones as luxury gadgets, in some of the poorest parts of the world, people are beginning to see it the other way around. Mobile phones in much of Africa are becoming a basic means of communication, while fixed-line phones are often simply unavailable.\nAppropriately, then, the chairman of the GSM Association, the body representing 330 operators of the world's most widespread type of mobile telephony, is from Johannesburg. Michael Stocks, a 30-year-old general manager with the South African mobile operator MTN Pty., wants to promote the development of communications in his native continent.\nIn some African areas, he said, mobile-telephone networks using the GSM (global system for mobile communications) standard are providing coverage in remote places where fixed-line networks would not have been installed for another 20 years.\n\"The mobile network is becoming the de facto national network,\" he said.\nIn Africa, as in other regions of the world where fixed wire networks are underdeveloped, wireless technology offers a cheaper alternative for improving access to telephones. Instead of running expensive copper wires from central exchanges to every customer's phone, one transmitter/receiver \u2014 called a base station \u2014 can connect thousands of phones to a network via radio waves.\nBase stations, which can provide coverage for mobile phones within a radius of 35 kilometers (22 miles), still need to be connected via switches to the national telecommunications network. But for someone living in an area with coverage, the ease of simply buying and using a mobile phone compares favorably with waiting for a copper wire to be laid, even if mobile calls are more expensive.\nThe state of mobile communications in Africa could be described as \"bottom- heavy.\" According to figures from the GSM Association, as of the end of June, the whole continent had 4.6 million of the world's 170 million GSM users, and 3.4 million of those were in South Africa.\nForecasts by the EMC World Cellular Database for the next five years predict 32 million mobile users in Africa by the end of 2003, with just under half of them \u2014 14 million \u2014 in South Africa.\n-\nACCORDING to Mr. Stocks, South Africa has some unique advantages. \"South Africa has a first-world economic and infrastructure environment and a kind of emerging-market mass base,\" he said.\nAnother reason for the comparatively high numbers of GSM users in South Africa is a set of community-service programs agreed between telecommunications operators and the government.\n\"For MTN, that was the installation of GSM pay-phones,\" Mr. Stocks said, explaining that these are \"normal-type card phones operating on the GSM network in areas where there was no other telephony.\"\nMTN's competitor, Vodacom Pty., does something similar, using telephone bureaus. These are prefabricated huts or trailers with a number of phones that look like fixed-line phones but that operate using the GSM network. Tariffs on these public phones are regulated as part of the community-service programs.\nMr. Stocks said MTN was running a loss on its pay-phone service, but he said its benefits had been \"profound.\"\n\"In terms of entrepreneurial activity,\" he said, \"you put a phone in a small village, and someone makes a living off selling the cards and managing the phone, so you create a little business there for somebody.\"\nHe also pointed out that the phones had allowed greater access to emergency services, reducing the instances in which people had to walk for five or six hours to call an ambulance.\nOther African countries may not have South Africa's infrastructure or government-agreed community-service programs, but mobile telephony is also growing rapidly in places where it is available.\nMike Jensen, an independent communications consultant who works with aid organizations, says cellular telephony is growing \"tremendously\" in Africa. \"A huge amount of the demand is pent-up demand for ordinary lines,\" he says.\nThe latest figures from the International Telecommunications Union, based in Geneva, show there were 15 million fixed-line telephones in Africa in 1997, or almost two lines for each 100 inhabitants. This number was increasing annually by 10.2 percent, the group said, whereas mobile-phone numbers rose 87 percent in 1998, albeit from a low base.\nAlmost a quarter of Africa's 4.6 million mobile users pay in advance for credits on a phone card instead of signing up for a contract or an account. While this figure is not unusual, Mr. Stocks predicts that prepaid phone use will grow quickly because of Africa's cash-based culture.\n\"People don't have a credit history, so you can't credit-vet them,\" he said. \"There's a lot of illiteracy; people don't have a billable address; they don't have bank accounts, so you can't do debit orders. There's a totally different environment, and with prepaid, we have actually managed to really get into these markets.\"\nBut as in the rest of the world, prepaid users in Africa usually pay more per call than contract users. \"Tariffs are relatively high,\" Mr. Jensen said, as that calls within a village are equivalent to long-distance calls.\nHe said calls were a little cheaper from GSM pay phones, such as the ones in South Africa, but there are no programs requiring GSM-based public phones elsewhere. MTN, which also operates in Uganda, has installed its custom-built pay phones there, but tariffs are not regulated and are high, Mr. Jensen said.\n-\nMOBILE telephony \"is not something that is reaching the masses\" in Africa, Mr. Jensen said. He says call prices will eventually fall but that operators are still recouping their investments from the cream of the market. He said he would like to see call charges drop from the African average of 50 U.S. cents a minute to 15 cents a minute, which he said was the average cost in Bangladesh.\nHe also said coverage was usually limited to main cities and towns and to within about 30 kilometers either side of main transport links.\nBut Mr. Jensen also is quick to point out that mobile phones already are providing some benefits to Africans. Members of the large African diaspora can give their families in Africa phones that allow only incoming calls, in many cases allowing calls home for the first time. In another example, in Malawi, some city officials are identified as phone holders for emergency use by the public.\nMr. Stocks, despite his role as an operator and promoter of GSM, admits that there are more urgent priorities in much of Africa, such as water, food, housing, and jobs.\n\"All of those things come before telephony,\" he said, \"but these things are going to happen and happen faster if there is contactability, if there is communication.\n\"So if it's a case of having absolutely nothing, or nothing plus phones, let's hope like hell that having a phone in that village at least starts to help to build the dynamics of that community and starts to help that community to grow and develop.\"\nEoin Licken's e-mail address: eoin@stilet.to",

    "text": "A Traveler's Most Arduous Journey, to the Land of No Diagnosis\n1999-06-13T05:00:00.000Z\nAt the age of 37, I had never been ill. As far as I could remember, I had never even had the flu. Famous for my iron constitution and robust good health, I had been working for many years as a travel writer, happily trotting off to the South Pole, spending months in India without a moment's sickness and, when I was pregnant, making medical history by getting constipated in Bangladesh.\nThen late last year I suddenly visited a place that was infinitely more foreign. It was the strange and frightening land of undiagnosable sickness and untreatable disease, a place where I was a new mother who became a child in need of her own mother. For 37 years I had barely given my body a thought; now it was about to betray me.\nWE had spent the weekend with my parents in Bristol, my hometown in the south of England. It had been a pleasant, ordinary weekend. On Sunday afternoon Peter, the man with whom I live, and I enjoyed a leisurely five-mile walk, pushing our 18-month-old son, Wilf, in his baby jogger.\nOver a cup of tea afterward, I remarked that I felt surprisingly tired. ''Should have walked faster,'' said my father, deploying our family's rigorous, pull-your-socks-up approach to weariness, depression, lassitude -- to anything, in fact, except unmistakable, big-time disease.\nHe came to rue his dismissive words, which subsequently entered family lore. ''Should have walked faster,'' a relative invariably quips on hearing that a famous person has died.\nAfter Peter drove us the 125 miles home to London that evening, I shivered from a mild temperature and had a vaguely cotton-wool head. Flu, I thought -- then, so what? I had a book to review, so I could stay in bed the next day and read it while Wilf was cared for by the much-loved nanny we shared with a neighbor.\nI stayed in bed, but the fever returned intermittently and was so debilitating that the book lay open at the same page for hours. Still, there was no real cause for concern.\nThen Wednesday evening, my symptoms became acute. My lungs ached, I had abdominal cramps, and when my little boy tried to cuddle me, I cried out in pain. I wasn't afraid -- not yet, but I recognized that my illness had won, temporarily at least.\nI rang my doctor in the morning from bed. She told me to come in when her office opened and that she would see me first as an emergency patient. I didn't feel like getting dressed, let alone going out, but I didn't have the will to argue.\nMy temperature was a lively 105. I vomited in the office. After examining my abdomen, my doctor asked me to wait in a side room. I now know that she telephoned the doctor on duty at the nearest hospital, saying she thought I was about to suffer liver failure and would be arriving as an emergency patient.\nUniversity College Hospital and its sister hospital, the Middlesex -- vast, Victorian edifices in the Bloomsbury and Fitzrovia districts of London -- are among the biggest teaching hospitals in Europe and recognized centers of excellence. While they have private wings, both hospitals are run by the National Health Service and, as such, serve the whole population.\nI was admitted to the accident and emergency department at the University College Hospital, where the doctor in charge and a few of his juniors set off down the road to diagnosis. How optimistically naive. None of us dreamed that diagnosis was to become the grail. It never occurred to me -- not for one moment -- that there can be illnesses with no name, whose cause is unknown, whose course is obscure, whose cure would be at best problematic.\nMY chest X-rays were clear, while an ultrasound revealed an inflamed and enlarged liver and adrenal glands. My temperature blazed on while I waited prostrate on a trolley in a narrow cubicle with ill-fitting curtains. I was put on a rehydrating drip.\nToo ill to move, I thought about nothing except getting through the next minute, and then the one after that: it was as if all other areas of my consciousness had shut down.\nThe hours unraveled. Peter arrived. A fistfight broke out as a homeless, intoxicated diabetic in the next cubicle refused to be admitted. I began to cough. I was insatiably thirsty. The doctors were foxed. A blood test had revealed acute pathogenic activity -- that is, my body was fighting off something -- but no signpost to a diagnosis. I was admitted to a ward, and my eyes began to feel gritty.\nPeter decided -- and it was a decision he stuck to throughout -- that while a hospital isn't a welcoming place for an 18-month-old, it would be better for Wilf to see me each day, as on some level this would reassure him that I had not disappeared forever. (The doctors had concluded early on that my illness was not communicable.)\nFor me, his visits were bittersweet. I longed to play our rough-and-tumble games, but could barely raise my head. I so desperately wanted to show Wilf that I was his cheery old mum, same as ever, but I could not perform this simple maternal task.\nAs I did not have a private room, Peter spent most of these visits restraining Wilf, who was drawn like a magnet to the medical paraphernalia surrounding the frailest woman on the ward. For the first time, I felt very afraid.\nTHE next morning, Day Two, a baffled consultant diagnosed nonspecific pneumonia (the kind that does not show up on an X-ray), prescribed antibiotics and consigned me to the care of a thoracic specialist at the Middlesex, where I was transferred by ambulance. My eyes were worse, but I was out of emergency and, more important, I had a label. The relief this afforded became clear only when Dr. Thorax looked at me, my X-rays and my medical records and declared that there was nothing wrong with my chest, that the antibiotics should be stopped and that I had hepatitis. There was no treatment for hepatitis, so we were to await the results of further blood tests.\nOver the next two days, my thirst and eye problems became acute. I was downing liters of water to no avail, while my voice diminished to a croak. My red eyes stung almost unendurably, at least taking my mind off my stomach cramps.\nWhat could be neither ignored nor denied was that nobody seemed to know what to do. The new blood tests revealed that although my liver was barely functioning, I did not have hepatitis. This was a heavy blow, as I was increasingly desperate to acquire a diagnosis, a label.\nI was feeling too poorly to read, but my father brought in a radio and earphones. This radio became my only friend during the long, lonely nights when my febrile imagination was stalked by death and the ineffable, heart-crunching sorrow of a small, motherless boy.\nExperts were called in from the further reaches of the hospital. A junior doctor from rheumatology performed a basic test on my eyes to determine how the lachrymal glands were doing. The results nearly had him leaning out of the cubicle, shouting, ''Hey everyone, come and see this!'' These glands, and their saliva-producing associates a few inches below, had stopped functioning.\nThe professor of rheumatology appeared, a wonderful old-school doctor in a white coat. (Some of the specialists I had seen looked like commodity traders.) The tear-and-saliva problem, he said, turned out to be a symptom of a variety of auto-immune diseases -- in which the body essentially attacks itself -- that come under the rheumatology umbrella. But blood tests for the most obvious auto-immune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis and lupus) were negative, and the professor said he didn't think I had any of these conditions, because the symptoms had come on too fast.\nNobody, it seems, wanted me. I looked enviously at other patients, all neatly categorized, all following a treatment plan. Getting well seemed a long way off: for the moment. I longed only to know what was wrong.\nIn their twice-daily rounds, doctors began posing increasingly bizarre questions as they trawled their memories to find a disease that might fit my case. ''Been in contact with deer?'' a gastroenterologist asked hopefully one morning. But I did not have Lyme disease. H.I.V. was ruled out since, according to hospital policy, I had been tested when I had my baby.\nMedical students were drawn, mothlike, to my bed. I was having so much blood taken, I wondered if I shouldn't add anemia to my list of symptoms. I was given drops to replace my tears, and was obliged to use them every 10 minutes.\nI was told off for drinking too much fluid: it was, the doctors and nurses said, thinning my blood. ''But I'm so thirsty all the time!'' I tried to tell them; no voice came out.\nA sinister spray of fake saliva arrived from the pharmacy, and I came off the drip. The nurses began measuring my fluid intake, and I was required to collect my urine in flasks so that they could measure it, too. In the middle of the fourth night, a nurse told me crossly that drinking too much could cause a cerebral edema, a swelling of the brain.\nMy world had shrunk. Or rather, it had vaporized, and I had entered a hostile universe. Although I longed each day to see my Wilf, when he arrived I wanted him to leave this place and get back to the warm and furry world he knew, where everyone loved him and there was no sickness or death or queer-looking tubes that he wasn't allowed to pull. He had quickly grasped the fact that Mummy wasn't playing, and spent most of his visits racing through the ward, annoying the harassed nurses.\nMeanwhile, life at home was lurching on without me as Peter struggled to cope with our child, the house, his job and hospital visits. My mother came to stay, and we relied heavily on our nanny, as I had an atavistic longing to see my mother holding a vigil at my bedside. I even wanted her to help me with the bath I struggled to take each day as part of my pitiful routine. It was a curious reversion to childhood.\nIn the end, Mum didn't really say or do much. She mostly sat, knitting, putting down her needles to hand me an occasional glass of rationed water. But it was enough.\nI instructed Peter to fend off other visitors, but was impressed at how my closest friends ignored my wishes and came anyway. I liked that, imagining that I might have done the same had the roles been reversed. My old chum Phil brought an immense bunch of flowers. Nice thought, but it sent my desiccated throat into severe spasm.\nBy that stage I was no longer surprised at anything that happened; indeed, I waited with keen interest to see which bit of me might fall off next. In some far-off part of my mind, I was grappling with the concept that medical science was imperfect. Something was going on in my body that nobody understood, and perhaps never would. It was a deeply unsettling notion.\nThe nurses managed to arrest the spasm by getting something syrupy down my throat, and I turned again to Phil. But he was slumped in the visiting chair, frightened out of his mind and looking in need of medical attention himself.\nFIVE days in the hospital, and my temperature had stopped spiking into the stratosphere. For the first time, the day's lengthening shadows did not bring that agonizing dread. My voice came back, and my cough subsided. I had had too violent a shock to indulge in optimism, however, and, anyway, my liver function was still very poor. I was wheeled off to distant hospital clinics to have various organs examined by specialists.\nSome of these places were reached by underground tunnels, stygian affairs in the bowels of London, the dusty walls lined with Dickensian medical tomes about the curative properties of the leech.\nThere had been talk of sarcoidosis, a chronic systemic disorder that tends to afflict women in their 30's. This diagnosis was popular with the liver consultant, but Dr. Thorax, a distinguished physician, was unconvinced. His ruling? ''A particularly virulent virus, a hepatitis-type virus,'' he said. ''I think you're going to get better on your own.'' He hesitated. ''Let's hope it's that, anyway.''\nAnd if it's not? ''It's something you'll have to the end of your days.''\nAweek after I had been admitted to the hospital, I was getting better; my doctors wanted to let me go home, but it was difficult to do that without a firm diagnosis. As a final, almost desperate measure, they ordered a liver biopsy.\nI still do not know whether they were looking for something very nasty and they just didn't want to say; I wish they had. One of the depressing aspects of my mystery illness was the lack of a focus for my anxieties. If you find a lump, you know what you're worried about. My demon was nameless.\nThe next day a bit of my liver was snipped out under local anesthetic. The day after, Dr. Thorax was confident enough to send me home before the biopsy results came back, and I was dispatched with industrial quantities of eye drops, saliva, mouth ulcer cream and mouthwash tablets (these last two to combat problems resulting from lack of saliva).\nIt was a mixed blessing. Out of the hospital, without a supporting infrastructure, I realized how very ill I had been -- and still was. For the first two weeks home, alone for most of the day, I could barely get up. My eyes were so painful, I was unable to read. I thought I was never going to get better.\nI was even annoyed to discover that despite two weeks of not eating and abundant sweating, I had lost only seven pounds. This seemed to me the most abject swindle, since surely one of the few fringe benefits of being ill was to be thin at last.\nIt was tough for Peter and Wilf. I used what little energy I had to maintain a functional living environment for us (just), and I had help from friends and relatives. Now that my condition was no longer worthy of hospitalization, I elicited less sympathy. It wasn't quite a question of walking faster, but almost.\nThe elegant 19th-century English essayist Charles Lamb spotted this when he wrote: ''How convalescence shrinks a man back to his pristine stature! Where is now the space, which he occupied so lately, in his own, in the family's eye?''\nI had serious problems maintaining my morale, and was obliged to acknowledge that my emotional stamina was not what it had been -- or what I had thought it was. I realized how desperately, in sickness, we need to be labeled and categorized. I longed to be told that I had pneumonia or hepatitis or any damned thing, rather than inhabiting this terrible no-man's, no-diagnosis land.\nIfell mysteriously ill very quickly, and I recovered in the same fashion. Suddenly I was no longer using eye drops every 10 minutes. My lachrymal and salivary glands started working, quickly reaching 90 percent production. The biopsy results revealed nothing more than inflammation. A month after I was discharged from the hospital, tests revealed a perfectly functional liver. I began to think about work.\nDid I learn anything? I'm not sure. I have developed a Proustian obsession with health. (''To kindness and knowledge,'' Proust wrote, ''we only make promises, but pain we obey.'') I have lost confidence in my body; I cannot dismiss even the simplest ache or pain, as I once did. I am acutely aware of my own mortality -- and of everyone else's. I do not find this a particularly helpful or healthy state.\nI scan the death notices in the newspapers, not looking at the names but trying to find tragic cases of mothers leaving small children behind in a lonely world. I think almost daily about trying to have another child, quickly, in case I die, so that my Wilf will have siblings to comfort him in his grief.\nCrazy? Perhaps. But serious illness changes the way you look at the world. I am more aware, too, of how sweet life can be, and this is a gift. I find it easier to spend less time at my desk and more on the park swings with my son. I perceive the medical profession with more sympathy: its members are not oracles. They are struggling to make judgments based on imperfect knowledge, like the rest of us. What they do not know is far greater than what they know.\nThe liver tests, by the way, were not the end. Two months after that, most of my hair fell out. The result of catastrophic illness, the experts said. But that was the beginning of the end. At least, I hope it was.",

    "text": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: First Asia, Now the World; Hong Kong's No. 1 Bank Changes Focus, and Its Name\n1999-02-23T05:00:00.000Z\nPeering down from the 28th floor of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank building, which resembles nothing so much as an urban oil rig, there is little doubt that one of the world's richest banks was built on a geyser of wealth from this former British colony.\nBut as the bank announced its 1998 earnings here today against the spectacular backdrop of Victoria Harbor, one could not help wondering: Whatever happened to the Hong Kong in the Hong Kong bank?\nFor the first time, the bank's London-based parent, HSBC Holdings P.L.C., reported its full-year earnings in United States dollars. HSBC executives said that they would seek a listing on the New York Stock Exchange later this year, in addition to the company's listings in London and Hong Kong.\nAnd most symbolically, the executives laid out plans to market the company's far-flung holdings -- from the British Bank of the Middle East to Marine Midland in the United States -- as a single entity. That means, as the company announced late last year, that the names of those holdings, including the Hong Kong bank, will all be changed to HSBC.\nIn doing so, analysts said, HSBC is trying to fashion a global brand name to compete with Citibank in many world markets.\nA streamlined, global HSBC is the product of a two-decade transformation from a local Hong Kong bank into one of the world's largest financial institutions and one that has proved remarkably resilient in the midst of Asia's economic typhoon.\n''The group's strategy of diversifying our assets has clearly been undertaken so that we don't have too many eggs in one basket,'' Keith R. Whitson, the group chief executive of HSBC, said in an interview here. ''I think the strategy has been vindicated by the events of the last 18 months.''\nIf Hong Kong plays a lesser role in HSBC's public image these days, it may be because Asia has gone from being the motor that drives HSBC to a shuddering brake on the company.\nThanks to a huge increase in provisions for bad loans at the Hong Kong bank, HSBC's overall net income fell 21 percent, to $4.3 billion, in 1998. While profits rose two-tenths of 1 percent in Britain and 11.8 percent in the United States, they plummeted 46 percent in Hong Kong.\nFive years ago, Hong Kong generated two-thirds of the pretax profits of HSBC Group. In 1998, it generated just 37 percent. Indeed, 1998 was the first year in HSBC's history that its Hong Kong and Asian operations contributed less to overall profits than its European operations: 38 percent versus 44 percent.\nThe results did not surprise analysts. They were, however, a sobering reminder that Asia's financial crisis is far from over. Although the bank said its markets in Indonesia and Thailand had bottomed out, it said it was still battling a rising tide of bad loans in Malaysia, Hong Kong, and, to a lesser extent, China.\n''The Asian operations are the backbone of our group,'' Mr. Whitson said. ''But I don't think anybody could have seen the dramatic devaluations and downturns that we've experienced in this region.''\nIn the last century, to be sure, the bank has weathered wars, revolutions and financial crises in Asia. It had been the dominant banking power in the trading city of Shanghai before the Communists took control in 1949 and seized the bank's imposing office building for the local party headquarters.\nAnd while the bank is currently playing down its Asian roots, some analysts predict that HSBC is poised to go on a shopping spree for distressed banks in the region. In its first such deal, HSBC said today that it would acquire control of South Korea's seventh-largest bank, Seoulbank, from the Korean Government for about $700 million.\nStill, HSBC is clearly climbing out of the Asian trough and making itself a different company. By plunging into the American capital markets, HSBC is ready to stake its claim as a pre-eminent global bank.\nBut first it must remake its internal culture. Long a bastion of Britons from elite schools who presided over their Asian outposts almost like colonial governors, HSBC is now training specialists in growth areas like personal wealth planning and credit cards.\nAlthough HSBC is still ruled by international officers -- a corps of 350 generalist bankers who can hop from Brunei to Buffalo with aplomb -- it has begun to recruit outsiders from Citibank and McKinsey & Company.\n''It's an evolutionary process,'' said Roy Ramos, a banking analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company in Hong Kong. ''HSBC had a very inbred culture, and it worked. But they could use new blood.''\nNothing underscores the bank's drive for a new image more than its decision to adopt the name HSBC worldwide. The company said it would spend $50 million, not including advertising, to stamp its name and hexagon logo on 5,500 offices in 79 countries and territories.\nThe strategy is an about-face for HSBC, which had brushed aside past suggestions to create a uniform brand. But executives now say the HSBC name will enable the bank to showcase its worldwide network and broad range of products. And that will persuade investors to place a higher value on its shares.\n''We tend to let our results speak for themselves,'' said Christopher Langley, the executive director of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. ''This is partly because we haven't had one single unit that we can get behind and say, 'This is HSBC,' whether you're in Brazil, or whether you're in Malaysia, or whether you're in upstate New York. In this day and age, you've got to make a little noise.''\nRetiring the names of its units is risky, though. Some -- like Midland in Britain and Marine Midland in the United States -- have been around for more than 150 years, and have deep roots in their communities.\nBritish newspapers have lamented the loss of the Midland name, which has hung from shingles in British towns since 1836. Though less venerable than its British sister, Marine Midland built a durable name as a consumer bank in upstate New York before HSBC acquired it in 1980.\n''I don't think people in Watertown, N.Y., have the slightest idea what HSBC stands for,'' said James Conmy, a former executive at Marine Midland and a speechwriter for HSBC's retired chairman, Sir William Purves.\nAnalysts, however, praise HSBC for trying to fashion a global brand. In Hong Kong, where the switch might seem to be the most traumatic, many people already refer to the Hong Kong bank as HSBC. (The parent company moved its headquarters to London in 1992, five years before China took back the colony.) And the company's second major local bank here, Hang Seng Bank Ltd., will keep its name since it is not wholly owned by HSBC.\nIf anything, some analysts said, the change is overdue. ''I think it's potentially a big help,'' said Judah Kraushaar, senior banking analyst with Merrill Lynch & Company in New York. ''The notion of tapping into HSBC's brand identity and global attributes could really help Marine Midland.''\nMr. Kraushaar said that under HSBC, Marine Midland had never broken out of its niche as a middle-market mortgage-lending bank. Similarly, Midland Bank in Britain has steered a steady but unremarkable course.\nIn Asia, removing Hong Kong from the Hong Kong bank may be politically astute move. When it was a British colony, Hong Kong was viewed as an international financial center. Since its return to China, though, Hong Kong is seen by other Asians as more of a Chinese city.\n''People tend to have certain predispositions,'' said Eric Tai, the head of consumer banking at HSBC, who was recruited from Citibank. ''When you talk about perfume, you think about France. When you talk about fashion, you think about Italy. When you talk about banking, you don't think about Hong Kong. You think about American banks, Swiss banks, and U.K. banks.''\nDespite its travails, Mr. Tai said HSBC was still determined to be a major force in consumer banking throughout Asia. It has opened branches from Korea to Bangladesh. But in keeping with its conservative style, it eschewed the aggressive consumer lending that has haunted rivals like Citibank and Standard Chartered.\nIn its agreement with the South Korean Government, HSBC will buy a 70 percent stake in Seoulbank, which has 292 branches and assets of $24.8 billion. In addition to its 30 percent stake, the Government will receive warrants equivalent to another 19 percent of the shares.\nThe Government has also agreed to put an unspecified amount of nonperforming loans in an asset management company. The bank also has the option of transferring still more bad loans into the company for one year after it takes over Seoulbank.\nHSBC's successful bid for Seoulbank came after it lost an auction late last year for another Korean bank, Korea First. In this deal, HSBC exhibited flexibility and unexpected muscle as a deal maker.\n''We initially thought the Korean Government would have more bargaining power after it sold the first bank,'' said Chunsoo Lim, a banking analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company in Seoul. ''But it didn't work out that way.''\nWith a foothold in Korea, HSBC could turn next to Thailand. Both HSBC and Citibank, a unit of Citigroup, analysts say, are in the hunt for Bangkok Metropolitan Bank, a troubled bank that the Thai Government plans to auction to a foreign bidder.\nHSBC's decision to sell its shares in New York has prompted speculation that the company may make a run at a major American bank. Wells Fargo is a frequently mentioned candidate. Owning United States shares, analysts said, would make it easier to finance such an acquistion, although they played down the possibility in the short term.\n''Everybody is trying to match us up with somebody; it's amazing,'' Mr. Whitson said. ''We're not about to go charging off just for the sake of making an acquisition or a merger. We're very focused on shareholder value.''\nBut no amount of prudence has sheltered HSBC from the Asian crisis. In Hong Kong alone, the volume of loans classified as nonperforming jumped to $2.5 billion last year from $619 million in 1997. All told, HSBC took a $2.6 billion charge to cover bad or doubtful loans last year.\nFor all its woes, the Hong Kong bank still occupies a lofty perch in the commercial hierarchy. And its ties with Hong Kong sometimes bind. As the main issuer of currency in the territory, it acts as a quasi-central bank.\nThe Hong Kong government is also the bank's biggest shareholder, thanks to its intervention in the stock market last summer. When executives at HSBC first floated the idea of listing their stock in New York last year, officials here asked them to hold off to avoid eroding local confidence.\nHSBC's sensitivities turn up in odd places. Recently, several economists left the bank after clashing with executives over their reports. One economist was forced out after he refused to endorse rosy projections for China's economy, according to two former executives.\n''Let me say this,'' Mr. Whitson said in a response that could sum up HSBC's credo. ''We are in 79 countries around the world. By definition, that means that we're a guest in 78. And we believe in behaving as guests should behave.''",

    "text": "Activism Surges at Campuses Nationwide, and Labor Is at Issue\n1999-03-29T05:00:00.000Z\nIn the biggest surge in campus activism in nearly two decades, student protests have burst onto the scene with rallies, teach-ins and sit-ins protesting sweatshops and other labor issues.\nStudents at Duke, Georgetown, Yale and 20 other institutions have focused on the sweatshirts and caps emblazoned with college names that are sold in every university shop, demanding that the companies that license college names not use overseas sweatshops.\nTwo weeks ago, University of Michigan students took over the office of the president to make such demands. The week before, 350 Harvard students held a rally to make similar demands, while also calling for raises for many of Harvard's janitors and dining hall workers.\nThe protests are the biggest wave of campus activism since the anti-apartheid movement in the early 1980's, when students called on colleges to sell off stock in companies doing business in South Africa.\nThe surge stems in part from unions' efforts to attract students to labor's cause and to train them to be activists. Over the past three years, unions have recruited hundreds of students for summer internships and, upon returning to campus, many of these students were galvanized to continue their battle to help workers in the United States and abroad.\nThe snowballing protests have included sit-ins at Duke, Georgetown and the University of Wisconsin and demonstrations at Brown, Cornell and Princeton. Last month, 40 Yale students staged a ''knit-in'' to highlight sweatshop abuses, while students at Holy Cross and the University of California at Berkeley staged mock fashion shows in which undergraduates walking the runway described the dismal conditions in which many garments were made.\nWhile today's protests bring back memories of the raucous 60's and antiwar demonstrations, the current activism is different. It is less vociferous, it often has the sympathy of administrators, and it has focused on labor issues -- there have also been rallies to defend affirmative action and promote gay rights.\nThe demands are also more modest than, say, the overthrow of capitalism. They include independent monitoring of factories that make college-name apparel, and a living wage for the workers.\n''We're not asking for a revolution,'' said Tico Almeida, a Duke senior who led a 31-hour sit-in in the office of Duke's president. ''We're just asking for improvement of working conditions. It doesn't seem like a lot to ask for.''\nSo far the protests have not involved violence. And in a far cry from decades past, university presidents have not demanded the arrest or ouster of students who occupied their offices. Many officials have even praised the protesters.\n''They are terrific students,'' Lee C. Bollinger, president of the University of Michigan, said of the 30 students who occupied his office and the 200 others who rallied outside. ''They're just the kind of students you want on your campus. They were interested in a serious problem, they were knowledgeable about the problem, and they really wanted to do something about it.''\nAmong the reasons that administrators have not reacted harshly are that they recognize that arrests can increase tensions and many college officials marched in protests themselves when they were undergraduates.\n''Back in the 60's, I was a student holding a sign,'' said Allan Ryan, a lawyer in Harvard's general counsel's office who has been the university's chief negotiator with anti-sweatshop students. ''Now I look out the window and say, 'Students are protesting. Let's see what's on their minds.' Now we look at student protests as being a normal part of the educational process.''\nWith encouragement from the apparel workers' union Unite, students have seized on sweatshops as a clear-cut issue that hits close to home and one in which they can make a difference. With $2.5 billion in college-name merchandise sold nationwide each year, students are confident they can use their moral stature and their universities' financial muscle to bring about changes in manufacturing, even overseas.\n''This was an issue which really moved a lot of people because, while the workers are making our clothes thousands of miles away, in other ways we're close to it -- we're wearing these clothes every day,'' said David Tannenbaum, a Princeton junior who helped organize a rally that drew 250 students. ''This subject resonates with a lot of students.''\nNot everyone applauds the protests. Laura Vanderkim, a Princeton sophomore, said, ''Who is a well-to-do Princeton student to say what a living wage is in Bangladesh or China? These workers may make above-average wages for the area. And arbitrarily raising wages could cause layoffs.''\nShe said the protests were unnecessary because school administrators sympathized with the students' demands. ''But that's to be expected because most university administrators are liberals,'' she said.\nLast year the University of Michigan earned $5.7 million in royalties for the products it licensed, while Duke received about $500,000.\nProtests at Harvard, Fairfield and Johns Hopkins, show another issue catching fire: wages for the lowest-paid campus workers, typically janitors and food workers. At the University of Virginia, students have joined with clergy and civil rights groups to argue that amid campus privilege, it is unfair that school employees earn $6.50 an hour and may need two jobs to get by.\nStudents with different backgrounds have joined the protests for different reasons. Xochitl Marquez, a U.C.L.A. junior, became involved because of a Mexican relative whose hand had become disfigured from working in sweatshops and who earned less than $200 a week even though she often worked from dawn until late at night each day. At Notre Dame, many protesters were inspired by Roman Catholic teachings that all workers should be treated with respect.\nSome protesters are ''red-diaper grandchildren'' or the children of 60's protesters. And many students began organizing protests after participating in Union Summer, a program in which hundreds of students worked as union interns, helping to organize low-paid workers, which usually entailed setting up street rallies.\n''One of the great untold stories in the 90's is that Union Summer has created, from almost nothing, activism on campus to a point where labor issues are among the leading issues among students today,'' said Greg Smith, a Columbia graduate student in sociology.\nDuke's president, Nannerl O. Keohane, said the protests grew out of a quiet type of student activism: community service in which students tutor children or work in soup kitchens.\n''This generation is one where there's a very strong sense of personal responsibility to make a difference for immediate, real people you can see and touch,'' Ms. Keohane said, adding, ''This has gone along with a pretty low interest in political action. My own hunch, as a political theorist, is this sweatshop movement is a direct outgrowth of this practical mindset.''\nPressured by students, many schools have agreed to require monitors and the disclosure of the names and locations of factories, a step that would make monitoring easier but is opposed by many companies because they do not want competitors to know about their factories.\nTwo weeks ago, the University of Michigan agreed to a far-reaching code of conduct that required companies that produce university-name apparel to monitor and disclose the names of their factories. The university also said workers at these factories should receive a living wage, but to the students' chagrin, the university did not commit to a living wage standard because it has not been defined.\nStudents hailed the university's commitments as a victory.\n''This code of conduct is as strong as it is for one reason: student activism,'' said Peter Romer-Friedman, a leader of the sit-in.",

    "text": "Coast-to-Coast Fireworks\n1999-11-21T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE United States seems keener than most countries to celebrate the new millennium in style: maybe the nation is wealthy and optimistic enough that big parties seem apropos. Whatever the reason, come Dec. 31, there'll be an outpouring of music, dancing, laser shows and fireworks, along with time capsules enough to keep archaeologists busy until the next millennium.\nAlthough one report has 60 percent of Americans staying home -- perhaps daunted by high prices and crowds, fearing the Y2K problems might complicate travel and A.T.M. withdrawals, and wondering whether maybe next year isn't the big transition after all -- from Lubec, Me., to San Diego, from Miami to Seattle, those who want to mark the moment they spin eastward into the year 2000 can find a civic gathering of kindred spirits -- reflective, hopeful, somber or exuberant.\nJust about every town and city is celebrating in some way, many with nonalcoholic, family-oriented public festivals, with events that are either free or inexpensive. Of course, there will be plenty of Champagne flowing, too.\nAnd, in case the moment passes too quickly, millennium events seem likely to span the entire year. Here are a handful of those end-of-the-year parties we'd hate to miss.\nNew York\nNew Year's Eve in Times Square will be the biggest party in the event's 95-year history, an ebb and flow of video broadcasts over 24 hours from around the globe on at least nine huge screens throughout the district, accompanied by a score of taped music from around the world, choreographed processional puppets, hundreds of costumed dancers and actors, tons of souvenir confetti and lots of special effects.\nA new crystal ball will start its drop at 11:59 p.m. It is six feet in diameter -- a bit larger than any of its predecessors -- weighs 1,070 pounds and is covered with 504 Waterford crystal triangles. Its 600 multicolored halogen bulbs, 96 high-intensity strobe lights and 92 rotating pyramid mirrors should produce a dazzling light show.\nA crowd of 1.5 million is expected, with more than a billion, perhaps, watching on television around the world.\nThe program is scheduled to begin at 6:30 a.m. on Dec. 31 to anticipate the arrival of the new year in the South Pacific at 7. Revelers will continue to celebrate with people around the world as each time zone greets the year 2000, until, finally, at 7 a.m. on Jan 1, Western Samoa moves into the 21st century. A major flourish will occur at 6 p.m. Friday, when midnight arrives in 41 countries in Africa and Europe, including a parade of a 741-foot banner of flags of those 41 nations.\nTen blocks south, about 25,000 paying guests are expected at the Jacob Javits Center for what is being billed as ''the party of the century,'' with performances by Aretha Franklin, Sting, Andrea Bocelli, the Duke Ellington Orchestra, Tom Jones, Kool and the Gang and others performing on four stages set up throughout the 22-acre center. There will also be dancing, drinks and food from top chefs. Tickets begin at $1,000 a person; (877) 313-3299 and (212) 644-8900, www .celebration2000.com.\nOther options, for a price, include a four-hour dinner cruise on the Circle Line, (212) 563-3200; Act II of ''Die Fledermaus'' at the Metropolitan Opera, followed by dinner and dancing on the tiers of the opera house, (212) 362-6000; a black-tie party aboard the Intrepid, (212) 245-0072, and a five-kilometer midnight run through Central Park with the New York Road Runners Club, with fireworks over the south end of Central Park, (212) 860-4455.\nMore information on events is available from (800) 692-8474 and www.nycvisit.com, as well as the Times Square Business Improvement District, the organization producing the Times Square event, at the Times Square Visitors Center, Broadway between 46th and 47th Streets, and at www.timessquarebid.org.\nBoston\nThe 24th annual First Night celebration in Boston will expand this year to three days of citywide festivities. Over three million people are expected at the alcohol-free event, to be centered around the Hynes Convention Center, City Hall, Boston Common and the waterfront. A $20 First Night button will cover a lot of territory.\nFireworks? In addition to the midnight finale over Boston Harbor on New Year's Eve, there will be a 7 p.m. (midnight Coordinated Universal Time, formerly Greenwich Mean Time) display over the Common, and more fireworks Saturday and Sunday at 7 p.m., over Boston Harbor. Throughout the three days, landmarks like the Custom House Tower and Boston Public Library will be transformed by lasers and other effects.\nAt City Hall, the plaza will be illuminated by 200 hand-carved ice candles, and two Jumbotron screens will broadcast the annual New Year's concert by the Boston Pops from Symphony Hall at 10:15 p.m. The conductor, Keith Lockhart, and Mayor Thomas M. Menino will lead an interactive countdown to midnight.\nThe Convention Center will be the site of drumming workshops and performances on Friday and Saturday, and the starting place of a ''Percussion Procession'' to Boston Common on Saturday afternoon. There will also be a family festival at the Hynes on Friday afternoon, with a Mardi Gras-style parade to the Common for the 7 p.m. kids countdown to New Year's at Greenwich. Dance parties with live music are scheduled for Friday and Saturday nights at the center.\nOn Friday afternoon and night, the Hynes also will be the site of ''Y2K Pops!,'' 101 personal computers of various vintages and makes playing all sorts of music, led by a robotic ''semiconductor''; an electronic scoreboard will track the crashing computer programs.\nOne of seven ice sculptures throughout the city will be ''Stargate 2000,'' at the Frog Pond on Boston Common. It depicts Father Time in his chariot, with a team of horses pulling him through a mammoth ice gate.\nThe Boston Public Library plans to celebrate poetry with readings, performances and music. First Night visitors will be able to recite their own poems to live jazz accompaniment, add poetry to a wall sculpture or compose on a giant magnetic board.\nOn Sunday, many cultural institutions, including the Boston Ballet, performing ''The Nutcracker,'' will admit free anyone showing a First Night 2000 button, which is also the entree to all other events. Buttons cost $20 each and are available at some Starbucks, Store 24's, McDonald's and Stop & Shop stores in the area, or from First Night Boston at (617) 542-1399 and www.firstnight.org. Children under 10 are admitted free Friday and Saturday to afternoon events at the Hynes center.\nLos Angeles\nLos Angeles doesn't have the big New Year's Eve tradition of New York or Boston, but the millennium demands a grand gesture. If the symbolic beacon of hope in New York is the Statue of Liberty, in Los Angeles it is the ''Hollywood'' sign, dark since the 1984 Olympics.\nAt 11:30 p.m. on Dec. 31, intense strobe lights will razzle-dazzle the sign back to life, followed by a laser countdown to midnight, with images projected on a mile of artificial fog above as parachutists descend with banners. This will be primarily a made-for-broadcast event and the event is not open to the public.\nBut everyone is welcome at five free neighborhood celebrations coordinated by the city's Cultural Affairs Department, which stresses that these are to be family-oriented, alcohol-free parties with live entertainment, children's workshops, art displays, food and strict security. Each festival will have a neighborhood cultural theme, with 2,000 gospel singers at Crenshaw Plaza, 2,000 line dancers at the Van Nuys Airport, 2,000 drummers at San Pedro Harbor, 2,000 folk dancers at the the Alameda Civic Center and 2000 marching band members on Grand Avenue downtown.\nThe events begin at noon Dec. 31 with Opus 21, a collective performance of music at many houses of worship -- using variously bells, shofars, Tibetan horns, cymbals and chanting. The music is to be followed by skywriting, hang gliders and other aerial surprises. Opus 21 will be repeated at 4 p.m. (midnight, Coordinated Universal Time), at 9 p.m. (midnight, Eastern time), and at midnight local time.\nFor those with early bedtimes, a children's millennium celebration at the five sites is planned at 8:45 p.m. with jugglers, clowns, drummers and a minilight show. At midnight at each site, the laser show at the Hollywood sign will be shown on large screens.\nThe video screens will also link the parties to regional celebrations, including a concert (tickets, $50 to $1,000) at the new Staples Center, (213) 365-6300, featuring the Eagles, Linda Ronstadt and Jackson Browne, and to millennium celebrations worldwide. Information: (213) 485-2787 or www.lacelebrate2000.org.\nOther parties with paid admission include ''Made in Hollywood,'' a benefit at Paramount Studios for the Los Angeles Public Library's literacy program, with food by Wolfgang Puck and the music of the Frank Sinatra Jr. Orchestra, (310) 451-1638, and ''Buffett by the Beach'' at the Universal Amphitheater, with Jimmy Buffett and his Coral Reefers, (877) 727-7689.\nChicago\nAnyone who's watched a Cubs game on television can testify that Chicago is really a darn-friendly kind of town. Chicagoans don't go in for the biggest, or the best, or the most spectacular. That's not to say they won't have big fireworks over Lake Michigan at midnight Dec. 31 -- they will. But the celebrations they're planning for the millennium are more people-oriented than spectacular.\nConsider, for instance, Mayor Richard M. Daley's New Year's Eve dinner party, at the McCormick Place Lakeside Center: a bunch of muckety-mucks guzzling Champagne, right?\nNope. In addition to representatives from a cross-section of Chicago, the mayor has invited working-class guests from every country in the world, and a few territories, possessions and nonsovereign states as well, to visit the Windy City for four days with a companion, with the mayor's International Millennium Dinner a highlight of their stay. The responses are still coming in, but invitees include a mechanic from Guatemala, a bird trainer from Vietnam, a teacher from Bangladesh, a secretary from Haiti, a farmer from Slovenia and a relief worker from Liberia. A limited number of tickets is available to the public before Nov. 30 for $100 from Ticketmaster, (312) 559-1212.\nThen there's the Milly. It's a new song and Macarena-like line dance, for ''all ages and levels of ability,'' created especially for the Dance Till the Dawn of the New Millennium party, a 2,000-minute celebration of dance from 9 a.m. on Dec. 31 to 6:20 p.m. on Jan. 1 at various sites. Planned are dance parties, salsa and polka lessons and dance performances at community centers, museums and nightclubs throughout the city, along with, it is hoped, lots of folks doing the Milly.\nInformation on the Millennium Celebration: (312) 742-2001 or www.chicago2001 .org.\nLubec\nSome places strive for significance; it just dawns on others.\nThe little town of Lubec (pronounced loo-BEK), at the northeast tip of Maine, will be the first town in the United States to greet the new year. Its 1,810 or so souls -- normally occupied with seafaring, berrying and wreath-making -- are planning a celebration focused on Lubec's easternmost red-and-white-striped lighthouse -- still commissioned -- at the misnamed West Quoddy Point, which should welcome the first light of 2000 at about 7:04 a.m., fog allowing.\nThe lighthouse will be the site of a flag lowering, with a color guard and a playing of ''Taps'' for the old millennium, at dusk on Dec. 31, with brief -- given the likely temperature -- speeches by Representative John Baldacci and other dignitaries. A millennium song, ''Children of Peace,'' will be performed by the Lubec School Youth Choir. The International Bridge, crossing to Campobello Island in Canada, will be lighted with ice candles starting at midnight in New Brunswick, which is an hour ahead of Lubec.\nA 5 a.m. ecumenical service at the Congregational Church will be followed by a volley of fireworks. Then, at the lighthouse, about seven miles away, a smaller burst of fireworks will greet daybreak, and be followed by more ceremonies, speeches and songs.\nThe Postal Service plans to send a mobile unit from Portland to issue two special cancellations, postmarked ''West Quoddy Head Station'' (meaning the lighthouse), one on Dec. 31 and another Jan. 1.\nOther events planned include ice-skating and a bonfire for young people the night of Dec. 31, and a polar bear-style dip on New Year's Day in the waters of Fundy Bay. Also on New Year's Day, an International Run for Peace will start on Campobello Island, -- the site of Franklin D. Roosevelt's family summer home -- and go to the Lubec School.\nIn fact, most of the social activity will center around the gymnasium of the school (it has 320 students), because that's the only place big enough for a crowd. The school will play host to visitors from noon to 7 p.m. on the 31st and from 9 a.m to 4 p.m. on the 1st, with a public dinner ($5) and a free breakfast. According to Ron Pesha, Lubec's Webmaster, public dinners of fish chowders, casseroles and cream cakes are congenial affairs. ''You're the public, and you're welcome,'' he writes.\nFor information, call Eve Preston at the Lubec Town Hall, (207) 733-7508 or visit www.nemaine.com/lubecmillennium.",

    "text": "Immigrant Diversity Slows Traditional Political Climb\n1999-12-28T05:00:00.000Z\nAs a teenager, Morshed Alam dodged enemy soldiers to deliver food to Bangladeshi independence fighters. And as a student at Dhaka University in the mid-1970's, he endured police beatings to organize pro-democracy demonstrations against the newly formed nation's military regime.\nSo it is hardly surprising that Mr. Alam dived headlong into American politics soon after immigrating to Queens 15 years ago. In 1996, he became the first Bangladeshi on a New York City community school board. In 1998, he challenged an entrenched Republican state senator. And when the county Democratic organization opposed his candidacy, he built his own insurgent political club.\n''Politics is the same everywhere in the world,'' said Mr. Alam, who lost the 1998 race but plans to run again next year. ''Nobody wants to give up their power. But times are changing.''\nAmbitious and impatient, sour on local Democrats but enthusiastic about democracy, Mr. Alam is a prime example of a new breed of immigrant politicians from Asia, the West Indies and Latin America who are beginning to take their places at the city's table of power, just as Italian and East European Jewish immigrants did 90 years ago.\nSome, like Mr. Alam, are rebelling against established politicians. Others are rebuilding dying political clubs. Still others are entering politics the old-fashioned way by running for ground-floor offices, like a spot on the school board, competing in races that often draw yawns from native-born politicians.\nThey are scoring small but significant successes. Dominicans control the Democratic clubs of Washington Heights. Asian-Americans hold five elected judicial positions and 15 seats on nine different school boards. And there are now eight people of West Indian descent in the City Council and State Legislature.\nBut the new immigrants have yet to reach the higher rungs of the city's political ladder. No Asian-Americans, West Indians or Latin Americans in New York City are Democratic county leaders, members of Congress or strong contenders for citywide office. Oddly enough, the thing they are celebrated for, their extraordinary diversity, has weakened their political strength.\nToday's immigrants come from more countries and speak more languages than the last great wave of European immigrants. They are more economically varied, with highly educated and skilled people among their ranks. And more than their predecessors, they are eschewing homogenous enclaves, scattering to neighborhoods across the city.\nFractured and dispersed, they have proved more difficult to unite into political movements. In New York, no group approaches the influence of Cuban immigrants in Miami, Mexican immigrants in San Antonio or even Asian-Americans in San Francisco, whose political power has been amplified by their more concentrated numbers.\n''There hasn't been a citywide candidate who can jell the immigrants, partly because it is such a diverse community,'' said John Mollenkopf, a professor of history at the City University of New York.\nBut the city's political landscape is changing in ways that could catapult more immigrant politicians into office. In 2001, term limits will force 36 of the 51 City Council members from office. Presented with that historic opportunity, political analysts predict, large numbers of immigrants will be registering voters and building organizations -- trying to rouse communities many veteran politicians once felt safe to ignore.\nAnd the immigrants will be there for the rousing. Since 1996, record numbers have applied for citizenship, spurred by Congress's decision to end welfare benefits for certain noncitizens and by the advent of dual citizenship in countries like the Dominican Republic and Colombia, which send large numbers of immigrants to America.\nMr. Alam, a cheerful, rail-thin man of 42 who is an environmental chemist for the city, is hoping to ride that wave to victory.\nLast year, he challenged State Senator Frank Padavan, a 13-term Republican who had made an issue of the cost of social services for immigrants. When the Queens Democratic Party refused to support Mr. Alam, he recruited immigrants into his own organization, the New American Democratic Club. With a shoestring budget and little campaign experience, they knocked on doors, gave out literature and helped him win 41 percent of the vote.\nA recent meeting of the club showed it to be as kaleidoscopic as the city itself. Among the 35 people eating chicken tikka and basmati rice at Mr. Alam's house in Jamaica were school board members from Korea and Taiwan; an Indian dentist and Pakistani professor; Roman Catholics from Colombia and Black Muslims from Brooklyn.\nTheir accents were as varied as their faces. They wore business suits, saris and flowing white robes. But they could clearly agree on one thing: it was time to have a voice, perhaps many, in American politics.\n''We have to show them we belong,'' Elizabeth Aivars, a Venezuelan immigrant, told the group. ''This is a political organization. We're not embarrassed to say that.''\nGetting Noticed\nJews and Italians Show the Way\nOn a November morning in 1914, hundreds of Jewish immigrants gathered along East Broadway in the chill before dawn, singing, dancing and hoping to catch a glimpse of their hero: Meyer London, a Socialist Party leader who had just been elected to Congress from the Lower East Side.\nTo those immigrants, Mr. London's election was a watershed. He was one of them, a new American who had come from Russia as a youth, the son of a print shop owner, a lawyer for garment workers. His election seemed to validate their yearnings for political influence and economic security.\nTwo years later, the city's Italian immigrant community elected its first member of Congress, Fiorello H. La Guardia. (Actually, La Guardia could claim a dual heritage; his father was Italian, his mother, Jewish. And in 1933, he was able to build a multi-ethnic, multiparty coalition to become mayor, the first Italian-American to do so.)\nTo political analysts today, there is an important lesson to be gleaned from London's and La Guardia's first elections: they came roughly three decades after the first waves of East European Jews began arriving in New York City. By that timetable, the Asian, Latin American and West Indian immigrants who began flowing into New York in the mid-1960's are not far behind.\n''By the Russian Jewish time clock, 1999 is equivalent to 1915,'' said Philip Kasinitz, a Hunter College sociologist.\nThe Italians and Jews became politicized at different rates. Italians, like many Hispanic immigrants today, were relatively slow to naturalize, in part because many did not intend to make America their permanent home. Jews become citizens faster, in large part because they had no intention of returning to Europe. They also brought with them urban traditions of socialist politics and labor organizing that caught on with immigrants in New York City's working-class streets and sweatshops.\nAnd while the Democratic Party was slow to recruit these Jewish and Italian immigrants, it eventually embraced them, and they it. By the 1950's, the old Democratic machine was dominated by Italians, particularly its last true boss, Carmine G. DeSapio. And Jews became important forces not only in the mainstream organization, but also in the reform clubs that produced Mayor Edward I. Koch.\nIn the 1960's, when strict immigration quotas were lifted, new waves of immigrants from Asia, Latin America and the West Indies began pouring into the city. And the very diversity of these immigrants has become a major hurdle not confronted by the Jews and Italians before them.\nIn 1933, when La Guardia was elected mayor, Italians and Jews together represented a third of New York's population. Today, Dominicans, the city's largest immigrant group, are roughly 6 percent of the population; West Indians as a group are about 8 percent. Chinese, the largest Asian group, are less than 4 percent. Unifying them will be a politician's nightmare.\nThe new immigrants face another challenge: the Democratic Party has been on a steady downward trend. Reform politicians have weakened the party's control over patronage, a fundamental recruiting tool. The modern welfare state has made the clubs' rudimentary social services seem redundant. Paid consultants have taken over the work of running campaigns, reducing the need for immigrant volunteers.\n''We can't even fix a parking ticket,'' said James McManus, whose great-uncle founded the McManus Midtown Democratic Association on West 44th Street more than 90 years ago. ''It's no wonder people don't come around anymore.''\nBut for all the obstacles, the new immigrants have had their triumphs. Just this decade, the Dominicans have come to dominate politics in Washington Heights, one of the most concentrated immigrant enclaves.\nDominicans virtually control the three local Democratic clubs and the local school board. They have elected one of their own, Guillermo Linares, to the City Council, and another, Adriano Espaillat, to the State Assembly. And when Representative Charles B. Rangel retires, many local party officials predict, the area is very likely to elect the first Dominican to Congress.\nAnd in the Bronx, the last of the city's true political machines, the county Democratic committee, which is dominated by Puerto Ricans, is trying to build citywide immigrant support behind Borough President Fernando Ferrer, who is considering running for mayor in 2001. He is a long shot, but his efforts may lay the foundations for an immigrant candidate to seek citywide office in the future. And perhaps, like La Guardia, that first successful citywide candidate will have roots in more than one immigrant group.\n''This is a group of people who are hungry, who are ready for ownership of a city that has not always been kind to them,'' said Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the county chairman.\nBreaking Out\nElectoral Success As a West Indian\nWho, many historians ask, will be the new immigrants' Meyer London?\nOne of the strongest candidates would seem to be a bespectacled, pixieish, hard-charging mother from the island of Jamaica: City Councilwoman Una Clarke of Brooklyn, who is aggressively raising money and courting support for a potential challenge to Representative Major R. Owens, a nine-term Democrat, next year.\n''They are pushing me to run,'' she says of her fellow West Indians, pretending she hasn't tried to stoke such talk. ''Their plot is to push me so far that I cannot turn back.''\nIn her drive for recognition, Mrs. Clarke, 64, clearly reflects the desires of many of the city's 600,000 West Indians -- particularly in Flatbush and Crown Heights -- to see their growing population translated into political power beyond the City Council or State Legislature. But by taking on Mr. Owens, who is African American, a Clarke campaign could also place her into conflict with central Brooklyn's other major voter bloc.\nIn the past, politicians from the West Indies -- including Representative Shirley Chisholm, an immigrant from Barbados who represented the 11th Congressional District in the 1970's -- generally viewed themselves as African-American leaders first and Caribbeans second. But for Mrs. Clarke, being from the West Indies seems to come first.\nIndeed, Mrs. Clarke, who must leave the Council in 2001 under term limits, has built her career on issues related to the West Indies. In the Council, her signal achievement was to legalize the unlicensed vans that are owned mainly by West Indian immigrants. And recently, she led a delegation to Washington to lobby for trade rules that would benefit West Indian banana growers.\nShe also aggressively courts immigrant voters, filling her weekends with visits to West Indian festivals and interviews on local radio shows. A service in Harlem commemorating the day of Bahamian independence was typical. Midway through the event, the nation's consul general, Dr. Doswell Coakley, spotted Mrs. Clarke in the second row -- an easy task, given her bright red pillbox hat.\n''Una Clarke is term-limited and moving on to other things,'' Dr. Coakley told the crowd as Mrs. Clarke covered her face with red-gloved hands in mock horror. ''She tells me she is Caribbean first, and that we keep her in the fore of our thoughts. We shall.''\nMrs. Clarke and her husband came to the United States in 1959 as students, had two children and decided to stay. Politics seemed to come naturally. She first got involved in Parent-Teacher Associations, then helped form an insurgent Democratic club that included Mr. Owens. Later she became head of a community group called the Caribbean Action Lobby.\nAnd in 1991, after the city created a majority-West Indian Council district in central Brooklyn, she defied the county's black-dominated Democratic organization, which supported an American-born black candidate, and won the seat.\n''I never saw bias until I ran in 1991,'' Mrs. Clarke said recently. ''When I entered office, the street talk was, 'Why do these West Indians feel they have to be in politics?' ''\nNow, her daughter, Yvette, 34, is considering running for her Council seat. More than the mother, the daughter moves seamlessly between two worlds. ''How do you like my daughter?'' Mrs. Clarke asked an acquaintance recently in the lilting voice that marks her as a West Indian immigrant. ''Is she an all-American girl? I'm getting there myself. It's taken a long time, but I'll get there.''\nWorking Together\nAsian Immigrants Look to Coalitions\nThe gathering of the North Flushing Civic Association was much like the dozens of civic association meetings held every month in Queens. A group of 60 middle-class homeowners, upset about a proposed Salvation Army church on 32nd Avenue, fired testy questions about increased traffic and ruined vistas at church officials.\nBut there was something different about this event: the man running it. He was John Liu, a 32-year-old immigrant from Taiwan, the association's president and one of just four Asian-Americans in the room. It is often that way for Mr. Liu, who is trying to become the first Asian-American on the City Council.\nWhile immigrant candidates in heavily concentrated immigrant communities like Washington Heights or Flatbush can afford to focus on their fellow countrymen, Asian-Americans in Queens cannot. Not only are Asian-Americans a minority in most Queens communities; many do not vote. Even in Flushing, where Asian-Americans are nearly half the population, they represent less than 20 percent of the registered Democrats. The rest either are not citizens or have registered as independents or Republicans, making them ineligible for the Democratic primaries that usually determine elections here.\nDon Nakanishi, director of the Asian-American Studies Center at the University of California at Los Angles, says that while Asian-Americans are quick to naturalize, they are slow to register to vote. The reasons he gives include a strong emphasis on work over other activities, and a fear of politics from living in authoritarian Asian societies.\nMr. Liu, an actuary, learned those lessons the hard way. In 1997, he was one of two Asian-American Democrats who challenged City Councilwoman Julia Harrison, a Democrat who had sharply criticized Asian-American business owners in Flushing on a variety of issues, including not posting signs in English. The two split the Asian-American vote, making it easier for Mrs. Harrison to win re-election with just 48 percent of the vote.\nWith Mrs. Harrison required to step down in 2001, Mr. Liu is working much harder to gain support among non-Asians -- not an easy task when many longtime residents bristle at the rapid growth of Flushing's Asian-American population.\nSo he fills his evenings and weekends with political events where he can meet and greet the borough's Democratic cognoscenti and voters. In addition to his civic association, he sits on the boards of the Queens Symphony and a handful of Democratic clubs, including one linked to the most powerful official in his Council district, Assemblyman Brian M. McLaughlin, whose support he hopes to win.\nA stocky, effervescent man with a boyish face and the kind of boundless energy a good politician needs, Mr. Liu arrived in Flushing at the age of 5 when his father, a bank executive, was transferred to New York. Back then, the family was among the neighborhood's only Chinese.\n''I didn't want to speak Chinese,'' he recalled in his unaccented English. ''I wanted to be white.''\nBut at the State University of New York in Binghamton, he became active in the Asian-American organization. Angry that the group was receiving far less financing than others, he and friends campaigned to pack the student assembly with Asian-Americans. They won, and the Asian Student Union got a $10,000 budget increase.\nFive years ago, he and his wife, a nuclear engineer, bought an 80-year-old Colonial-style home just a few blocks from where he grew up. Sometimes he recalls the racial slurs of his childhood as he walks door to door, trying to drum up support for his incipient campaign.\n''People say to me: 'I'm Italian. You are going to know what I need?' '' he said. ''I say: 'You need regular garbage pickup. You need the schools to be good. And you know what? That's what I want, too.' ''\nJoining Ranks\nHell's Kitchen Club Takes Latin Flavor\nThe McManus Midtown Democratic Association on West 44th Street has the musty, other-era feel of someone's well-kept attic. Outside, a red-haired man sells J.F.K. buttons. By the door hangs an oversize drawing of George Washington Plunkitt, the salty Hell's Kitchen district leader whose blunt advocacy of ''honest graft'' was Tammany Hall's turn-of-the-century motto. Old men sit watching television.\nBut on a recent evening, there was a distinctly new New York feel to the club's clientele. A family of Mexicans sat on folding chairs inside the door, awaiting help with a housing matter. A few paces away, a club member filled out immigration forms for a Colombian woman. And in the back, a Brazilian man leafed through a sheaf of job openings at city agencies.\nCarlos Manzano, the club president, looked on happily. ''I did my homework,'' he said, referring to the job listings he had compiled. ''That's what Carmine DeSapio told me. Do your homework.''\nIn one sense, the 33-year-old Mr. Manzano, who builds and manages World Wide Web pages for a living, is something of a political throwback, the last of a dying breed. But in another, he may be the model for something new: immigrants trying to revive the city's political clubs.\nMr. Manzano, who emigrated from Colombia in 1985, joined the club 11 years ago as a student at Queens College, simply because he wanted to learn about American-style politics. He was the club's second Hispanic member. But over the next few years, he recruited other immigrants, largely by providing basic services: citizenship classes, free legal services and assistance in navigating the city bureaucracy.\nIt was not quite like the old days, when clubs could put a supporter's nephew on the city payroll or get a friendly judge to go easy on a particular case. But the club's Hispanic membership grew steadily to 600, about half of its total.\nThis Latinization drew grumbles from some of the older Irish and Italian stalwarts. But the effort had the blessing of Mr. McManus, who had installed Mr. Manzano as president and helped elect him a district leader. To him, Mr. Manzano represents not just the future of his club, but of New York City politics.\n''Nobody gave the Irish and Italians anything,'' Mr. McManus said, adding, ''So I've been waiting for someone like Carlos to come along and do the same thing for poor and working-class Hispanics.''\nWith that in mind, Mr. Manzano, whose ever-crisp attire and dignified bearing seem as old-fashioned as his politics, ran last February for City Council in a heavily white district that extends from West 74th Street into Greenwich Village. Derided as ''the machine candidate'' by his opponents, he finished second in a field of four.\nSince then, he has received feelers from other Hispanic leaders about running as a pan-Hispanic Council candidate in Queens. More appealing to him is spending nights at the club. As he prepared to close down at 10:30 on a recent evening, a frail looking, elderly woman walked in and asked for a private meeting.\nAs they emerged from their talk a few minutes later, the woman began to toddle off, then stopped and gave Mr. Manzano a kiss on the cheek. ''You will take care of that, right?'' she asked. ''Cause if you don't, who will?''",

    "text": "Sites to Get You There\n1999-02-07T05:00:00.000Z\nWEB sites for would-be, armchair and actual travelers are proliferating faster than you can say ''dotcom,'' with so many links that it's easy to lose your way. Following are 44 useful, informative or intriguing sites that can help you find or reach your destination.\nPortals\nTo travel on the Web you should have a home, a place where you pick up the mail or chat with friends. If you belong to one of the big on-line services like America Online or Compuserve, you already have one, with links both to their proprietary sections and to the Web at large. But they also have homes, called portals, on the Web proper that are stripped-down versions of their commercial services; other portals were born on the Web to begin with. All offer such facilities as E-mail, news, calendars and shopping, and all have versatile search engines for finding travel sites. You can narrow your search at the beginning by going into their travel subsections.\nAmerica Online, www.aol.com. This is a very crowded page and not as homey as the regular A.O.L. site. But the travel section is filled with categories covering destinations, reservations, business travel, travel news, weather, and airline, cruise, hotel and rental car directories.\nCompuserve, www.compuserve.com. Not as dull-looking as the regular Compuserve site, the travel section is slim, with seven recommended Web sites, including Barnes & Noble, presumably because you can buy travel books there.\nThe Microsoft Network, www.msn.com. Microsoft keeps trying. Clicking on ''travel'' takes you to Expedia, Microsoft's dedicated travel site.\nYahoo, www.yahoo.com. This is my favorite home on the Web, with a fairly well-organized travel subsection you can bury yourself in.\nExcite, www.excite.com. This is my home away from home. I usually begin by reading my horoscope to see if taking a trip is a wise notion.\nOn the Town\nMSN Sidewalk, www.sidewalk.com. For a guide to entertainment and shopping in any of some 75 United States cities, plus Sydney and Melbourne, this is a good first stop. There are also sports scores, white and yellow pages, and airline tickets.\nCity Net, www.citynet.com. Lodgings, restaurants and entertainment in 31 United States cities, a full plate of travel news, and reservations through Preview Travel, as well as E-mail and chat rooms.\nNewsdirectory, www.ecola.com. Primarily a source for English-language newspapers and magazines, but if you click on Travel Planner under the Bonus heading you get a list of visitors centers in the 50 states by town and area code.\nFodor's, www.fodors.com. Fodor's has been a name in travel for as long as most of us can remember, and its Web site is rich with resources for making your own miniguide for a journey.\nEvents Worldwide, www.eventsworldwide.com. This is a reference site for festivals, carnivals, arts, sports and other events.\nEventseeker, www.eventseeker.com. An international business and leisure events database catalogued by date, location and type of event.\nThe San Jose Mercury News, www5.mercury center.com. A huge guide to travel, news, and everything else in northern California, and wherever else Knight Ridder publishes newspapers.\nThe New York Times, www.nytimes.com. This site carries articles from the Travel section, and the companion site, New York Today (also reachable directly at www.nytoday.com) can guide visitors to the city.\nBooking Sites\nPreview Travel, www.previewtravel.com. Many other services, such as City Net, call on Preview Travel for reservations. You can go to it direct, for information as well as reservations.\nExpedia, www.expedia.com. Microsoft's broader travel site, where you can plan a trip to practically anywhere, and buy airline tickets and make hotel and car reservations.\nTravelocity, www.travelocity.com. This is one of a handful of front ends for the Sabre reservations system that professionals use, with some 420 airlines, 40,000 hotels and 50 car-rental companies. It will even send you an E-mail message if a price changes in your favor.\nTravel Facts, www.travelfacts.com. Travel Facts calls itself a research tool. Provides access to airline, rental car and hotel Web sites, a travel-agent database, all kinds of links, a chat room and feature articles.\nPriceline, www.priceline.com. You make a bid for an airline seat or a hotel room, and if the establishment is willing to accept it, Priceline lets you know.\n(Of course, if you know where you are going and how you want to go, every airline has its own Web page.)\nMaps to Anywhere\nThe Perry-Castaneda Library Map Collection, www.lib.utexas.edu/Libs/PCL/Mapcollection/world cities.html. All the services offer different combinations of such tools as currency converters, weather forecasts and maps. If getting a map is a first priority, however, a good place to look is the Perry-Castaneda Library at the University of Texas at Austin. The endless list of maps of continents, regions, countries and cities, mostly produced by the State Department, runs from Abidjan to Zagreb. In the event that you can't find your map in Austin (Austin, for instance, is not one of the maps), the collection is linked to other map sites.\nWorldwide Brochures, www.wwb.com. Here are maps, as well as guides and brochures, more than 15,000 of them. They cost nothing, usually come by snail mail and, since they are promotions issued by the countries, cities, or establishments themselves, are hardly objective sources of information.\nFavorite Places\nCaribbean Tourism, www.caribtourism.com. A guide to weather and events in 36 Caribbean destinations, prepared by the Caribbean Tourism Organization.\nParis France Guide, www.parisfranceguide.com. Paris sites are all over the Web.

This site ''mines'' the net to produce concise suggestions in a dozen categories, including travel. Although that category contains the usual suspects, there is a commendable emphasis on such things as camping, eco-tourism, bed-and-breakfasts, and traveling with children. The Web sites are picked by a real person with a name, not by committee or robot.\nEconomy Travel, www.economy travel.com. Economy is an international travel consolidator with contracts with airlines for discounted prices. The seats that go to a consolidator have not been sold through the more usual channels, so it is often possible, or even necessary, to make last-minute arrangements. You fill out a form on screen and, if a flight meets your requirements, book it. Most of the familiar airline names are on the list, as well as ones you might not think of, like Biman Bangladesh, Ukraine International and Jersey European.\nA.A.R.P., www.aarp.org.

    "text": "Smallpox: The Once and Future Scourge?\n1999-06-15T05:00:00.000Z\nNo one has come down with smallpox for decades. But in some respects it is potentially more dangerous than ever.\nSmallpox killed more people over the ages than any other infectious disease. In the 20th century alone, experts estimate, it took up to a half billion lives, more than all the wars and epidemics put together.\nIts scars run deep. As long as three thousand years ago, Chinese records tell of slow deaths and disfigurations. Signs of pockmarks appear on the mummified head of the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses V. The disease decimated Europe and traveled with colonists to the New World, laying waste to tribes and aiding British soldiers who spread the virus as a biological weapon.\nToday, the high fevers, deep rashes and oozing pustules that characterize smallpox are gone -- a feat of disease eradication so far unequaled in the history of public health. This banishment is so complete that recent medical textbooks often skip the disease or give few details of its wrath.\nDespite this triumph of modern medicine, Washington and key allies now fear the scourge could strike anew sometime in the future, unleashed by war or terrorism. And that worry is raising new alarms and questions.\nWhat makes the virus so deadly? How well do old vaccinations work? What about new drugs and vaccines? How likely is a smallpox attack?\nSome answers are grim. For instance, troubles with quality control are such that no stored smallpox vaccine in the United States can now be used except in emergencies, Federal officials say. Stoppers on vials are deteriorating and a vital ancillary medicine is unusable.\nA turning point came on April 22 when the United States -- one of two official smallpox repositories around the globe, along with Russia -- announced that it would delay its intended destruction of the virus, reversing years of planning and Washington's previous stance.\nThe virus was to have been destroyed this month, the first species driven to extinction by design rather than accident. But the Clinton Administration, after careful study, concluded that clandestine supplies probably exist and could cause the disease to emerge suddenly in war. And it reasoned that living samples might aid the development of new treatments and antidotes.\nIn the wake of that decision, a host of other actions are now taking shape. Most visibly, top scientists and health experts are now calling for a Federal program to produce new vaccine to protect up to 100 million people in the United States -- enough, in theory, to stop any epidemic in its tracks. More quietly, American and Russian scientists hope to embark on studies to better understand the killer's ways in an effort to perfect a cure. And most stealthily of all, intelligence agencies are stepping up their efforts to better judge the threat of smallpox attacks.\n''It's disturbing, extremely disturbing,'' said Dr. Donald A. Henderson, the scientist who led the global campaign that eradicated smallpox and now is dean emeritus of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. ''I thought the door had closed on smallpox. I had happily put it away.''\nDr. Joshua Lederberg, a Nobel laureate in biology who advises Washington on germ warfare, called the eradication ''one of the great humanitarian accomplishments of our century.'' But he added: ''We have no idea what may have been retained, maliciously or inadvertently, in the laboratories of a hundred countries from the time that smallpox was a common disease. These would be the most likely sources of supply for possible bioterrorists.''\nTo the extent that past is prologue, the experts say, the history of smallpox offers clues to the dangers and opportunities that may lie ahead.\nExperts warn that if smallpox returns it could be more deadly than ever. The effects of the disease on an unprotected population were underscored by the experience of settlers who set sail from Plymouth, England, landed on the Massachusetts coast in 1620 and found the area remarkably free of Indians because a deadly epidemic had just swept through. Early explorers had already spread the virus.\nOver the ages, immunities built up slowly as people survived the infection, with children usually faring better than adults. Later on, vaccinations helped keep the scourge at bay.\nToday, experts say, such protections are all but gone and people are generally more vulnerable to the disease, underscoring the need for intelligent debate and possibly protective action.\n''We're all Indians,'' said Dr. Elizabeth A. Fenn, a smallpox historian at George Washington University. ''We're approaching 100 percent susceptibility.''\nThe Murderer\nAs Viruses Go, Huge and Vicious\nNo one knows where smallpox came from. Viral historians say it probably began as an epidemic disease 10,000 years ago when human populations first grew dense. The virus is unusual in that it inhabits only humans, unlike many whose main home is in animals.\n''It had to have evolved from its natural forebears,'' said Dr. Lederberg, a president emeritus of Rockefeller University. ''Close relatives like monkeypox are still fairly prevalent in the rain forests, occasionally reaching humans.''\nEvidence that the disease has existed for at least three millennia is found in the scars on the head and shoulders of the Pharaoh Ramses V, who died as a young man in 1157 B.C., perhaps of the disease. Deities in India and West Africa are devoted to smallpox, attesting to ages of devastation.\nThe disease, probably spread by traders, is said by historians to have reached Europe sometime in the first millennium.\nIn 1520, Hernando Cortes, the Spanish conqueror of Mexico, is believed to have unintentionally brought a smallpox-infected slave with him to the New World. In the next two years, an estimated 3.5 million Aztecs died.\nIn 18th-century Europe, smallpox killed 400,000 people a year, peasants and monarchs alike, a toll proportionately equivalent to more than a million deaths today. The disease in one 80-year period is said to have taken the lives of a Queen of England, an Emperor of Austria, a King of Spain, a Czar of Russia, a King of France and a Queen of Sweden. And President Abraham Lincoln in 1863 was probably feverish with the disease when he gave the Gettysburg Address. Two days later, he broke out in the gruesome rash.\nModern science has found that the smallpox virus, known as variola, is a monster in size, possessing one of the largest genetic blueprints of any virus. Whether that helps explain its extraordinary lethality is unknown. What is clear is that, unlike most viruses, it is highly stable outside its host and can retain its powers of infection over long periods of time, aiding its spread among victims.\nAfter a person is exposed, the virus multiplies rapidly and spreads unobtrusively through the body's lymph system for about two weeks. Suddenly the symptoms come on. The head, back and muscles ache. The temperature spikes as high as 104 degrees, leaving the victim drained. In these hours, little distinguishes smallpox from garden-variety flu.\nIn about two days, fever and aches give way to pockmarks. At first they dot the tongue and roof of the mouth and then, over a few days, break out over the face and spread to the arms and legs. Flat and red at first, the pox over two weeks or so turn into small blisters and fill with pus, after which scabs form. Sometimes the entire rash becomes bloody.\nIn its early stages, the disease is often confused with chicken pox, and one way to distinguish them is that the smallpox rash often spreads farther, covering the palms and soles.\nAbout a third of the victims die, mainly from blood loss, low blood pressure, cardiovascular collapse and secondary infections. Many survivors are scarred and blinded. Others have shortened bones and other complications.\nSmallpox spreads easily once the rash appears in the throat or skin, and studies have shown that each infected person typically passes the virus to three or four others in close contact, often by coughing. In hospitals, the virus has been shown to travel surprisingly far in the air.\nThe Eradication\nHunting Down An Assassin\nIn 18th-century Europe, one segment of the population -- milkmaids -- attracted medical attention because they escaped smallpox. Surmising that these workers may have developed an immunity from their association with cows, who were prone to a related disease, cowpox, Edward Jenner, a British physician, in 1796 vaccinated a boy with material from an infected cow, Blossom.\nTwo months later, Jenner inoculated the boy with smallpox virus, but the boy did not get sick. He was immune. Jenner had successfully developed the smallpox vaccine. Jenner sent his report on this breakthrough to the Royal Society, which promptly rejected it. So Jenner published the historic paper on his own.\nLike any vaccine, Jenner's worked by alerting the body's immune system to the threat of microscopic invaders, prompting the formation of antibodies to fight them off. The novelty was that Jenner used one virus to protect against another, the first being similar enough to trigger the body's defenses. Cowpox protected against smallpox even though the two viruses, though clearly related, are distinct species.\nJenner dreamed of eliminating smallpox. But no serious efforts were made until the 20th century. As late as the 1930's, smallpox struck up to 50,000 people each year in the United States. The last case occurred in 1949 in Hidalgo County, Texas. Although Jenner had used cowpox virus, a third virus, vaccinia, became the standard vaccine against smallpox. Experts say vaccinia is related to the smallpox and cowpox viruses, but its origin is a major scientific mystery.\nGlobal vaccinations and quarantines began to be envisioned when, after World War II, the World Health Organization was founded as an arm of the newly established United Nations.\nIn 1959, W.H.O. resolved to eradicate smallpox, largely at Moscow's urging. But little happened until 1966, when the United States and the Soviet Union proposed $2.5 million for an expanded effort. That year two million people died of the disease, mainly in Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan and African countries south of the Sahara.\nMass vaccinations were not enough to stop all viral transmission. So planners added strong measures to hunt down hidden cases and quarantine victims in an effort to create transmission barriers.\nIn many countries, tribal healers were hired to perform vaccinations, eventually doing much good. ''They were soon out of a job,'' recalled Dr. Henderson, who led the global campaign.\nEurope wiped out smallpox early on. But infected foreign visitors still caused outbreaks so severe that hospitals specifically for smallpox were built. As late as the 1960's, West Germany constructed two such hospitals.\nIndia was one of the last major hurdles. In 1975 during a two-week period, 130,000 workers visited 100 million homes there, finding many smallpox cases. Cash rewards produced others. With each sweep, the smallpox count dropped.\nOnce India was free of the disease, attention turned to Ethiopia. Counts fell and the global effort seemed over. But then cases popped up in Somalia, on the horn of Africa. After another push, W.H.O. recorded the last case on Oct. 26, 1977, putting the Somali victim in quarantine.\nWith that, the person-to-person chain was broken, defeating the scourge.\nIn 1980, W.H.O. proclaimed the world free of smallpox and soon asked for all laboratory samples of the virus to be destroyed or sent to central repositories. But it had no inspection powers. The heroes of the eradication effort had to take nations of the world on their word when, one by one, they said the dreaded virus was gone.\nThe Threat\nDark Evidence Of Hidden Arsenal\nThe deadliness of smallpox has long beckoned to military minds and was exploited in the New World with relative ease. Settlers and soldiers from Europe often had immunity because of childhood exposure. And Indians did not. So the virus tended to kill selectively, overcoming a general drawback of germ weapons.\nDuring an Indian uprising in 1763, Sir Jeffery Amherst, commander of British forces in North America (and namesake of the Massachusetts city), suggested that the disease be sown deliberately. ''Could it not be contrived to send the Small Pox among those disaffected tribes of Indians?'' he wrote a subordinate, encouraging the use of ''every stratagem in our power to reduce them.''\nIn fact, his men at Fort Pitt, today Pittsburgh, had already forged ahead without his encouragement, giving Indians infected blankets and a germ-laden handkerchief. Epidemics ensued, but historians are unsure to what extent the spread was due to natural or deliberate exposure.\nDr. Fenn, the George Washington historian, who is finishing a book on smallpox epidemics in America, said Amherst and his men's independent pursuit of smallpox weapons showed the idea's prevalence and wide appeal, which continued into the Revolutionary War.\n''They were willing to use it in nasty ways,'' she said of British forces. ''But it's almost impossible to determine how effective it was.''\nStill, she said, George Washington was suspicious enough of the British using smallpox as a weapon, and had lost so many troops to the disease, that in 1777 he ordered his men to undergo crude inoculations. The Americans, in contrast to English soldiers, had typically grown up without exposure to the disease. Thus, like the Indians, they had no acquired immunity.\nDespite its apparent disuse in the last two centuries, the idea of smallpox as a weapon has never disappeared. Indeed, evidence has recently surfaced that many such armaments were made, if not used.\nIn 1992, a Soviet official named Kanatjan Kalibekov, now known as Ken Alibek, defected to the United States. In secret debriefings, Mr. Alibek, formerly a top player in Soviet germ warfare, told Washington that Moscow had made tons of smallpox for war, and he suggested that the virus might have been sold or secreted away as the Soviet state collapsed and Russian scientists sought new ways to support themselves.\nLast year he went public, and he followed this year with a book, ''Biohazard'' (Random House), which details a nightmare of smallpox weapons that he says the Soviet Union made, including warheads for long-range missiles.\nW.H.O.'s announcement of the disease's eradication in 1980, Mr. Alibek wrote, had prompted the Soviets to redouble their smallpox efforts. ''Where other governments saw a medical victory,'' he said, ''the Kremlin perceived a military opportunity.''\nFederal officials say they have confirmed many of Mr. Alibek's smallpox claims and have also found signs that the virus is now hidden in Iraq and North Korea, although they report seeing no evidence of smallpox arms or planned strikes. The intelligence, they say, helped drive Mr. Clinton's April 22 decision to forgo destruction of American stocks.\nOfficially, destruction of the virus has been put off three years, until at least June 2002, as world health authorities debate the stay.\nThe Vaccine\nNagging Doubts About a Life Saver\nIn 1972, the United States stopped routine vaccinations of civilians against smallpox, nearly a decade ahead of much of the world. Thus, about 114 million Americans born since then, 42 percent of the population, are completely vulnerable.\nFor people age 27 and older who were vaccinated, the degree of protection is unclear because scientists have never systematically measured the duration of immunity. Protection probably drops with time, but how much is unknown. Lifelong immunity is unlikely, some experts say. But old vaccinations may lead to milder attacks.\nAt the end of the eradication program, W.H.O. and a number of countries independently stored enough smallpox vaccine for 60 million people and kept a safeguarded supply of the vaccinia virus to make vaccine in case more was needed.\nWith its cache, the United States in theory could protect up to 14 million people if each vial of stored vaccine was used to its maximum potential of 100 doses. The manufacturer, Wyeth Laboratories, holds the supply of vaccine in Marietta, Pa., under the control of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.\nSmallpox vaccine is still needed at C.D.C. for scientists who work with the virus. But serious problems with quality control have stopped vaccinations, creating an acute problem for a very select group of scientists in the United States and, in the event of an emergency, a much wider group of people.\nCrumbling rubber stoppers on vials are letting in moisture, and a brilliant green dye is inexplicably losing its color, but the vaccine remains near normal potency, Federal experts say. The bigger problem is that the American supply of a colorless liquid medicine, known as vaccinia immune globulin, which is needed to counteract adverse reactions to the vaccine, has turned pink for reasons no one understands. Federal rules say the medicine must be on hand before vaccinations are given, and the Food and Drug Administration has barred its use until the mystery is solved.\nA further complication is that new batches of vaccine cannot be made with the old process, since today that process would fail to pass the F.D.A.'s more rigorous standards.\nIn late 1997, prompted in part by Mr. Alibek's revelations, the Pentagon embarked on a $322 million program to make new vaccines for the military, including smallpox. The earliest it will be ready, officials say, is 2005 -- if it can pass F.D.A. muster. That will be difficult. Because the disease no longer exists and the virus is too lethal to unleash on people, clinical trials cannot be conducted to test whether or not the new vaccine actually helps humans resist smallpox.\n''Ultimately, they're going to have to make a fairly substantial judgment call,'' Steve Pryor, president of Dynport, the Pentagon's vaccine contractor, said of F.D.A. officials.\nCivil authorities in Washington want at least 40 million doses of new smallpox vaccine, and health experts like Dr. Henderson, who now heads a center for the study of bioterrorism at Johns Hopkins, are calling for 100 million. Talks are under way for Dynport to produce vaccine for civilian use as well, but nothing to date has been worked out.\nMeanwhile, some experts question the whole vaccine approach as a germ warfare safeguard. Foes, they say, knowing well in advance about vaccinations, might counter them by switching to a different germ or a different variant, perhaps genetically engineered.\n''Defensive measures are much more difficult than offensive ones,'' said William C. Patrick 3d, who made germ weapons for the United States before President Nixon outlawed them three decades ago.\nSuch threats are helping fuel a search for new ways to combat smallpox and related viruses, including the development of new kinds of anti-viral drugs. Unlike vaccines, such drugs, if found workable, might be administered long after exposure to save infected victims, attacking the virus directly rather than relying on the body's immune defenses.\nIn March, the National Academy of Sciences released a 108-page report listing new research frontiers, many of which American and Russian scientists are already pursuing, such as trying to understand the genetic secrets that make the virus so deadly. Combined with the intelligence assessment that other countries were harboring smallpox for military use, the academy report influenced the Clinton Administration's decision to forgo destruction of the virus.\nThe great unknown, experts say, is whether the benefits of such planning will ever be needed in a crisis and, if so, whether the protections will work as envisioned. But the consensus is that action is nonetheless needed.\nEarly this month, Federal experts meeting in Atlanta reviewed the germ threats facing the nation. Smallpox came out on top. Second was anthrax, which causes high fevers and death but is not contagious. In comparison, smallpox spreads like wildfire.\n''It was unanimous that smallpox is the primary threat,'' said Dr. Henderson, who attended the Federal meeting. ''The likelihood of an attack is small, but were it to occur it would be a real catastrophe.''",

    "text": "Kashmir War, Shown on TV, Rallies India's Unity\n1999-07-18T05:00:00.000Z\nThe crowd heaved and moaned and pushed up against the plain wooden box that held the body of Suresh Kumar, an Indian soldier killed in the fighting with Pakistan over Kashmir. But as the lid was pried open, the throng parted easily to let television cameramen in for a close-up of the young man's mother. Her eyes brimmed with tears as she gave her son's face a final caress.\nThe people of this north Indian town, population 35,000, have vicariously experienced India's small undeclared war over Kashmir by watching television and they wanted to share their part in the drama with the rest of the nation, even as the fighting draws to a close.\n''When we got the news of his martyrdom, we felt lonely,'' said Balwan Singh Malik, a 40-year-old farmer. ''But when people came to this village from the outside world, we didn't feel lonely anymore.''\nIndia has fought three larger wars with Pakistan, in 1947, 1965 and 1971, but the last two months of fighting in the Himalayan land of Kashmir that lies between them has produced India's first televised war. In 1971, fewer than 1 in 200 of India's households had TV's. Now, it's more than 1 in 3.\nHere in Mokhra, people huddled around their radios to follow India's victory in the 1971 war, which led to the dismemberment of Pakistan and the creation of Bangladesh. Only a few families had televisions. While telephones are still a rarity here and cars rarer still, most people now either have a television set themselves, or a friend or relative who does.\nMuch as the railroads of the British colonial era helped knit together this polyglot, multilingual subcontinent into a nation, so television has rallied people from all over this vast country behind the war effort, including the multitudes who cannot read a newspaper.\nSome social critics have celebrated this renewed sense of unity in a country so often beset by fissures of caste, region and language. But others fear the consequences of a nationalism that is so built on mistrust of Pakistan -- and contrast it to the nationalism of India's founders, who aspired to ideals of nonviolence and brotherhood.\n''What worries me is that security vis-a-vis Pakistan may become the top item on our policy agenda,'' said Yogendra Yadav, a political scientist at the Center for the Study of Developing Societies, based in New Delhi. ''That's very sad for a country like India. We have a lot of other things to handle -- hunger, poverty, clean drinking water.''\nWhether for good or ill, this war -- fought on Indian soil and at a cost of hundreds of soldiers' lives -- has stirred public passions in India, much more than in Pakistan. The conflict goes back to the partition of India and Pakistan when they gained independence from Britain in 1947. Kashmir, which has a Muslim majority, was made part of predominantly Hindu India rather than Islamic Pakistan.\nWhile India has clearly identified Pakistan as the aggressor in the recent fighting, Pakistani officials have continued to insist -- despite widespread disbelief among experts and Western diplomats -- that the men fighting the Indians are not Pakistani soldiers and Pakistan-backed militants, but Kashmiri freedom fighters. Pakistan's official account has distanced people there from the conflict. And the Government's refusal to accept bodies that India says are Pakistani soldiers has meant there have been many fewer emotionally fraught funerals in Pakistan.\nIn India, the signs of an aroused public are everywhere. Blood donations to the Indian Red Cross Society in New Delhi have tripled. School children have collected money and movie stars have given benefits for soldiers' welfare funds.\nTwo weeks ago India pulled out of a cricket series it plays every year with Pakistan in Toronto. Just four months earlier, India was the host to Pakistan for a series in which an Indian audience gave a standing ovation to a victorious Pakistani team.\nHere in Mokhra, the war is universally seen as a completely justified reaction to the enemy's infiltration and occupation of Indian territory in Kashmir, especially coming as it did less than three months after India had reached out its hand in friendship to Pakistan.\nThe conflict has saturated television screens here and across India with searing images of battle and death, of valor and sacrifice -- and helped harden public sentiment against Pakistan.\nThe sense of betrayal is bracketed by two sets of images. The first is from Feb. 20. Karan Singh, a 58-year-old farmer, recalled what he saw live on television and said it was ''still fresh in my mind.''\nOn that day, India's grandfatherly looking Prime Minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, 72, rode a bus to Pakistan on a peacemaking mission, and when he crossed the Indian border into Pakistan, he awkwardly embraced Pakistan's Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif.\n''He went to build a harmonious relationship with Pakistan,'' Mr. Singh said. ''They agreed that nobody would cross into each other's territory. Pakistan betrayed us.''\nNow, the bus as a symbol of hope between these neighbors, both burdened by common problems of poverty and illiteracy, has been replaced by the unforgettable imagery of war.\nRajesh Malik, a teacher, recalls the awe he felt as he watched India's giant guns firing shells that soared through the sky in great fiery arcs to land on peaks. Mr. Singh recounted the pride he felt when soldiers stuck India's tricolored flag into a towering peak they had recaptured from fighters. And Balwan Singh Malik, the farmer, said he would always remember the ceremonies honoring the dead as their bodies were carried home to every corner of India.\nThe death of Mr. Kumar, the first soldier from Mokhra to be killed in a war since India gained independence, bestowed great honor on his hometown and his family, residents say. Like a majority of Mokhra's residents, he was a Jat, a member of an upwardly mobile peasant caste with a long martial tradition. Most every Jat family here has at least one member in the military or the police.\nWhile he was posted on duty last week in Kashmir, Mr. Kumar was killed instantly when struck in the ear by shrapnel. On Monday, military officers from New Delhi arrived at his parents' door. In less than 24 hours, the news had spread far and wide. A local radio station and newspaper announced it, and word of mouth carried it farther.\nHis hometown set aside space for a memorial and gave his family four acres of land. Shops and schools in the area were closed on Tuesday, the day of the cremation.\nBy dawn, thousands of people who had never met Mr. Kumar began to gather along the roadside into his hometown. They stood or squatted on their haunches, silent and solemn in the dust and heat, waiting patiently by the hour for the army truck carrying his body.\n''One of our brothers died, so we should pay our respects to him,'' said Ram Kishan, a nearly toothless farmer from the neighboring town of Madina. Mr. Kishan practically spit when the subject of Pakistan came up. ''We are common people,'' he said, ''but if they come here we will chop them up. We can even go there to do it.''\nThe rutted dirt roads of Mokhra -- normally deserted in the pitiless midday heat -- were filled with sweating throngs of people. At Mr. Kumar's home, hundreds of people crowded into the courtyard and perched on the walls that enclosed it. Men smoking hookahs sat on one side and veiled women commiserated with one another on the other.\n''He was the son of the country's, not of mine,'' said his mother, Bhagwani. But her disheveled appearance, trembling voice and the low moans that escaped unbidden from her throat belied her brave words. The face of Mr. Kumar's wife, Sulekha Devi, 28 and eight months pregnant, was a stern mask. ''I have no regrets,'' she said repeatedly.\nAs the convoy of jeeps and trucks that accompanied Mr. Kumar's body inched along the road to his home, schoolchildren of 6 and 7, dressed in green gingham uniforms, shouted ardently in unison: ''Who will defend the nation? We will!''\nCameramen posted on the wall of the courtyard captured Mr. Kumar's sad homecoming in all its pageantry and chaos, as the crowd in the courtyard surged forward. The cameramen moved in on the pine box as it was opened, and followed it to the cremation grounds. There, they positioned themselves at the head of the funeral pyre, as aspiring politicians clustered nearby, so close the cameras could not miss them.\nMore than ten thousand people packed the grounds. They were piled on the tops of buses, on the roofs of buildings, in the backs of flatbed trucks and on the hoods of tractors. They lined every available wall. And chants rose up spontaneously from them.\n''Long live Suresh Kumar!'' they shouted. ''Death to Pakistan!''\nFor a town where the plodding gait of an ox cart and the slow rumble of a tractor set the pace, this was a moment lifted from the ordinary, a moment of grandeur and rage and public catharsis.\nWhen Mr. Kumar's mother walked onto the raised ground where the pyre was situated, the crowd burst into applause and they clapped again when more than a dozen soldiers lifted rifles to their shoulders and fired a salute.\nAfter a parade of family members and honored guests offered garlands and sprinkled the pyre with marigold petals, Mr. Kumar's body was covered with herbs and his face smeared with ghee, a clarified butter that is auspicious and speeds the fire. Thick gnarled tree limbs and sprays of kindling were piled on top of him.\nMr. Kumar had no son to light his pyre, so his father, Mir Singh, a wizened old farmer in a white turban, put flaming straw to it and watched as it went up in a whoosh of ravenous fire.\nThat evening, people all over Mokhra clustered around their televisions for the nightly national news on Doordarshan, the state-run television station, and found themselves featured in a tribute to what the announcer solemnly called ''the martyred soldiers who died fighting the enemy.''\nFor a moment, this small farming town in the state of Haryana had become part of the nation's history. The dead soldier's father said, ''They made sure his martyrdom will be remembered and recorded.''\n--------------------\nKashmir Withdrawal Complete\nKARGIL, India, July 17(AP)\nIslamic fighters completed their withdrawal to beyond the India-Pakistan cease-fire line today, a senior Indian Army commander said, effectively ending a two-month battle in the icy heights of Kashmir.\nBrig. Ramesh Kakar said Indian soldiers reaching the cease-fire line in the last battle zone could see small remaining groups of fighters trekking into Pakistan.\nThe fighters, which India has said included Pakistani soldiers and Pakistani-backed militants, had already left their fortified stone bunkers and cleared the heights in other battle regions Maj. Gen. Mahinder Puri said. Pakistan has said the fighters were Kashmiris fighting for independence.\nIndia had extended a Friday pullout deadline at Pakistan's request. An Indian army spokesman, Col. Bikram Singh, said the army would review the situation today.",

    "text": "ASIA-PACIFIC ISSUE; Bhutan, Remote and Rich in Tradition\n1999-04-18T05:00:00.000Z\nFOR decades, the Himalayas have captured the popular imagination like few other destinations. But the once-legendary kingdoms of Tibet, Ladakh and Sikkim all now exist as Shangri-Las of the imagination. They have vanished from the map as independent states, having been absorbed by China or India. Many of their temples have been destroyed, their quiet isolation broken forever. And Nepal, which remains independent, has opened its arms wide to tourism and foreign aid, with predictably mixed results.\n Yet, just to the east of Nepal, hemmed in by jungle on its southern border and mountains above 20,000 feet in the north, nestles the Thunder Dragon Kingdom of Bhutan. As if the exception that proves the rule, Bhutan is the last independent Buddhist Kingdom of the Himalayas. Bhutan's King, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, rules with a raven crown and an unquestioned mandate (although last year he took a step toward constitutional government with the election of a new Cabinet and the decision to allow periodic votes of confidence). There is no Bhutanese television, and watching foreign programs is forbidden. The country's regions are administered from a network of centuries-old fortresses.\nBhutan is trying to hold the ills of modern civilization at bay. In its forests are golden langur monkeys, the oxlike takin and rare butterflies, while its narrow valleys shelter Buddhist temples unparalleled in beauty and function throughout the Himalayas.\n For years, ''Bhutan: The Himalayan Kingdom,'' the superb guidebook by Francoise Pommaret, has been tucked away on one of my bookshelves at home. Most of the time, the volume goes unnoticed (like Bhutan itself, I like to think), but when occasionally opened it reveals a mysterious and alluring world that I vow once again to visit . . . someday. \n Unexpectedly, in late 1997, I had the chance to meet Ms. Pommaret, a French Tibetologist and one of the world's few experts on Bhutan. Her advice: ''Save your money and go.'' And so, in October last year, I finally did.\n The kingdom opened only to very limited tourism in 1974. And the number of visitors remains small because of Government policy; in 1998 there were roughly 6,000 tourists. All travel in the country must be arranged through a Government-licensed tour operator -- either directly or through travel agents at home who will ultimately contact one of the Bhutanese agencies. One pleasant surprise is that several of the Bhutan tour companies have Web sites and can be contacted by E-mail. During their stay, travelers are accompanied by a guide, and although itineraries can be amended, you cannot strike out on your own.\n Most agencies are happy to fashion a personal itinerary. My girlfriend, Lucie, who has agreed to join me on this expedition, and I choose the individual option. \n Once we arrive in Bhutan, our guide is quite receptive to individual whims and is almost always ready to alter schedules. Once he brings us to a town, we are free to wander alone but more often choose the company of our escort, whose presence allows us to talk to ordinary people and get access to holy sites that otherwise would be closed.\n Before the Indian Army's Corps of Engineers built the country's handful of surfaced roads in the 1960's and 1970's, reaching Bhutan's capital at Thimphu involved a weeklong ride on horseback across serpentine mountain paths. Now, armed with a prepaid tour voucher, you can enter the country by car at Phuentsholing, or take Druk Air, the national airline, which links Bhutan's only airport at Paro Valley with flights to New Delhi, Bangkok, Calcutta, Katmandu and Dhaka, Bangladesh.\n Provided you're sitting on the correct side of the plane, the flight affords spectacular views of the entire Himalayas. Swooping down into the Paro Valley, the Druk Air jet dodges mountaintop monasteries and alights on a runway set in the middle of rice fields. Three-story wood and mud-brick chalets perch on the surrounding hills, overlooked by a massive, whitewashed fortress that houses the district's body of monks and local administration.\n Each of the country's 20 administrative districts is dominated by its own fortress, called a dzong. Most dzongs date to the 17th century, when Bhutan's disparate provinces united into a single country. Bhutan's national language -- Dzongkha -- means, simply, the language spoken in dzongs.\n The ride to Thimphu -- just 30 miles away -- takes nearly two hours and gives us our first taste of driving, Bhutanese-style. The single-lane road that links the west to the east of the country is hewn straight out of the rock face, spiraling in a continuum of hairpin turns from one valley to the next. As we barrel up and down this natural roller coaster we try to concentrate on the scenery ahead rather than the frothing gorges below. \n Thimphu, with a population of some 20,000 people, plus a few packs of street dogs, resembles a large mountain village more than a national capital. Scooters and cars imported from India and Japan are on the increase, but hardly pose a threat to pedestrians. The Bhutanese capital has not a single traffic light.\n We are here for the annual Tsechu -- a four-day religious festival of music and ritual dances that draws villagers from all the surrounding valleys. Held in the stone courtyard of the Thimphu dzong, it is a dazzling show in the grand medieval tradition. As silk-robed monks and dancers twirl to the beat of drums, court jesters, wearing papier-mache masks and wielding large wooden phalluses, lampoon the performances. The audience, crowding the improvised stage, erupts in roars of bawdy laughter. The fables that the dancers act out range from morality tales to historical drama. Every Bhutanese knows them, and the Tsechu is a chance for audience and performer to share in what is part religious ceremony and part earthy, ribald spectacle. \n Although the number of Western visitors to the Tsechu has increased in the past couple of years, foreign faces remain unobtrusive amid the sea of Bhutanese. Exchanging a couple of greetings in Dzongkha elicits warm smiles and wins us a place in the crowd. But the audience's attention is quickly refocused on the performers.\n From Thimphu, we load up with supplies for our cross-country drive and planned three-day trek through the country's central Black Mountains. The dzong at Trongsa provides a welcome break from the bone-jarring journey.\n The Trongsa monastery, perched high above a steep green ravine, is one of Bhutan's largest, housing some 300 monks in a dozen inter-connected courtyards. And its whitewashed walls, meshed with intricate wooden latticework, are capped by golden pagoda roofs.\n As in all dzongs, only the courtyards are open to foreigners, and only when accompanied by the requisite guide and permit. But the local monks graciously open a couple of chapels for us, where we perform the ritual three prostrations before the altar, with the instruction of our guide, before being blessed by juniper-infused holy water. The chapels are dark, lighted only by small butter lamps, so it takes some time for our eyes to adjust before we notice we are staring into the beatific eyes of a giant gold Buddha. He is flanked by two other temple guardians, who form a sacred trio with him in the Dragon Kingdom: the Guru Rinpoche, who brought Buddhism to the country in the 8th century, and the bearded Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyel, who united Bhutan in the 17th century.\n So far, we have been traveling with our mandated guide and a driver in an Indian minibus. But now that we have reached the start of the trek, our party swells to include a mountain guide, a cook and a local farmer who is renting us her pack ponies.\n Women own most property in Bhutan, from which they derive their status as equals to men. But our horsewoman is taking no chances and accompanies us throughout the trek to keep an eye on her animals. Unlike in Nepal, there are no sherpas or porters in Bhutan. But the Government mandates that everything on treks, including cooking fuel, must be taken along so that the countryside remains pristine. And as there are no marked paths, trekking is not a do-it-yourself affair. \n As we wend our way through muddy riverbeds and boulder-strewn trails, our three-day journey takes us through forests of giant rhododendron, which are not in bloom, cedar and pine. Every few hours, we emerge from the canopy to sight more rows of green, undulating mountains. These are not the high Himalayas, where treks last a minimum of a week and are more arduous. But our ascent to nearly 13,000 feet and subsequent rapid descent to a ''mere'' 5,000 feet leaves us pausing for breath.\n At the height of the trek, the cedars are shrouded in clouds and intertwined with dripping lichen. The steep gorges below, their slopes covered with dwarf bamboo, make us feel as if we have stepped into a Chinese scroll painting.\n Each night, we camp, Lucie and me in one tent, our guides in the other in a high clearing. As the temperature plunges near freezing, local farmers come to greet us and share their pungent ara brew around the campfire. Ara, which is distilled from barley and drunk hot with a scrambled egg and dollop of butter thrown into the mix, is not exactly my cup of tea -- but then again it is deeply warming. The four-course meals of steaming noodles, chilies and vegetables that our cook whips up send us all to our tents feeling blessed. \n In these remote highlands, there is no electricity, so locals also retire to their darkened farmhouses soon after the early sunset. We perform ablutions streamside. The next day we awake to the sound and sight of furry white monkeys -- miniature yetis -- gamboling through the nearby underbrush. \n Nimble-footed children lead us on to the next stage of our trek. Unlike their counterparts in the valleys below, they have no school here to attend. Over the past two decades, Bhutan has launched a program of gradual modernization, which has brought primary-school attendance throughout the country to roughly 70 percent. But during a fireside chat one evening, we learn that in these isolated areas, small monasteries are often the only link to knowledge and the outside world. Parents who have boys can send them for schooling, but once they do, the boys are expected to enter the monkhood and remain celibate. And as these subsistence farmers tell us, that is too great a sacrifice for them to make.\n Our trek ends in a tropical, low-altitude valley. The landscape has metamorphosed once again from alpine meadows and cedar forests to rice fields and banana trees.\n After parting with our mountain guide, cook and horse bearer over a cup of thick butter tea, we drive eastward to the fertile Bumthang Valley. This corner of Bhutan is one of the most sacred and is known for its numerous temples and holy sites. But feeling a little ''dzonged out,'' Lucie and I take a tour of the so-called Swiss farm. Established with Swiss technical assistance several years ago, the farm now produces cider, schnapps, beer and very fine semi-soft cheese. \n The Bhutanese cheese master, working inside a refrigerated cellar stacked with hundreds of wheels, carefully bastes and turns each Tilsit for the duration of the three-month aging period. The result, a mild tasting cheese that melts in the mouth, rivals any Alpine produce that I've tasted. \n Before we devour our own cheese wheel, it is time to head back to Paro. The 10-hour drive is broken by an overnight stay in the balmy Wangdi Valley, traversed, for once, not by a rushing torrent, but a meandering blue-green river.\n The hotel here is the newest we stay in. But tourist accommodations throughout Bhutan, whether lodges or small hotels, tend to be relatively comfortable as well as colorful. Wooden ceilings are often adorned with Buddhist paintings and walls hung with hand-woven tapestries. Hotel bathrooms have modern plumbing but often leaky pipes and no hot water or toilet paper. And electricity is often spotty, but candles are always provided. \n The food usually is the highlight of our inn stays. At Wangdi, dinner is the standard ample buffet of rice, noodles, sauteed shiitake mushrooms and vegetables, cheese and chili-filled momos (delicious Tibetan dumplings) and, as it is in season, yak stew, which tastes much like beef. For effete Western palates, the spices in restaurant food tend to be dulled down. But for the real thing, ask for ema datse. Bhutan's national dish consists of red-hot chili peppers cooked, as a vegetable, in a delicate cheese sauce. Don't forget to order a heap of rice. We ingest it all with no stomach problems. Tea, bottled water and juices as well as beer (from India) are all normally available.\n The next day, as we drive through the silent rice fields of Paro to catch our early morning flight, dawn illuminates the dzong, edged in ocher, cerulean and gold. We stop for one last look. The wind carries up the faint echo of spinning prayer wheels.\n I say a little prayer of my own and wonder if Bhutan, which clearly finds itself at a crossroads, will manage its transition to the modern world. \n Bhutan faces many dangers. And because it is now sandwiched by the world's two most populous nations, China and India, it also finds itself balancing above a geopolitical precipice. This has forced the kingdom into a pragmatic alliance with New Delhi. For now, India acts as Bhutan's guarantor of independence, but one day the tables could turn, as they did for neighboring Sikkim. \n It is poignant and sobering to think that the vast Himalayan Buddhist tradition, with its complex rituals, art and architecture, is now represented in an intact living form only by Bhutan -- a tiny corner of its former spiritual empire. But even in the Kingdom of the Thunder Dragon, time doesn't stand still. As we part with our guide, he confesses that he and his neighbor are saving up to import a TV from India.\nIf you go\nGetting There\n The Government of Bhutan charges each foreign visitor (except Indian nationals) a minimum of $200 a day. Solo travelers pay an extra $40 a day; pairs pay $30 each, and groups of three pay $20 each. The fee includes accommodations, internal travel, treks and meals. \n Visas are required. To obtain one, tourists must either work with a travel agency in their home country that will then deal with a Bhutan agency licensed by the Government, or deal directly with one of the Government-licensed agencies. The agencies will take care of all formalities and book your accommodations and guide as well as passage into the country (by air or road). \n Among the principal licensed agencies in Bhutan are: \n Bhutan Yod Sel Tours and Treks, Box 574, Thimphu, Bhutan, (975-2) 23912, fax (975-2) 23589; on the Internet: www.travel.bt. \n Etho Metho Tours and Treks, Box 360, Thimphu, Bhutan, (975-2) 23162, fax (975-2) 22884. \n Sakten Tours and Treks, Box 532, Chang Lam, Thimphu, Bhutan, (975-2) 25567, fax (975-2) 25574;www.bootan.com/sakten.htm. \n Bhutan Tourism Corporation Limited, Box 159, Thimphu, Bhutan, (975-2) 22647, fax (975-2) 23392. \n Several United States tour operators also offer all-inclusive trips to Bhutan. Among them are: Bhutan Travel, 120 East 56th Street, Suite 1130, New York, N.Y. 10022, (800) 950-9908 or (212) 838-6382, fax (212) 750-1269, and Geographic Expeditions, 2627 Lombard Street, San Francisco, Calif. 94123; (800) 777-8183 or (415) 922-0448; fax (415) 346-5535; www.geoex.com.\nAdditional Preparations\n The Thimphu Tsechu takes place in autumn (dates vary according to the lunar calendar) and the Paro Tsechu in spring.\n I used Francoise Pommaret's guide ''Bhutan: The Himalayan Kingdom,'' which has been reprinted in several editions. \n The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends vaccinations against hepatitis A and typhoid, plus boosters as needed for tetanus-diphtheria, measles and polio. Hepatitis B vaccinations are advised in some situations, including for those who might be exposed through medical treatment.\n Antimalarial drugs are recommended for travel in rural areas bordering India.

    "text": "From a Babel of Tongues, a Neighborhood\n1999-12-26T05:00:00.000Z\nOn Saturdays, Walter Arana moves like one of the turbo-charged action heroes from the movies he rents and sells in his store in Woodside, Queens. His hands fly from the cash register to the computer to the videos stacked behind him and then to the push-button clicker he keeps around his neck to buzz the door open for the steady flow of customers.\nThe phone rings. ''Si. Si. Wait a sec,'' barks Mr. Arana, a linguistic quick-change artist in a neighborhood where people come from 49 countries and speak 34 different languages. Then he pirouettes, aims the remote control and silences the soccer game that has transfixed an Irish immigrant waiting at the counter.\nNodding hello to two teenagers deliberating in Bengali by the horror films, Mr. Arana registers them with the practiced eye of an urban anthropologist. He knows they are from Bangladesh, just as he knows the names of British soccer players and Dominican movie stars, because it is smart business to know.\n''In a neighborhood like this one, it's good to know even the capital of their country and ask them about it,'' he says, gently motioning for the two to show him what they want, ''because when they first come to the States, they feel no one knows them.''\nMeet Walter Arana: Peruvian immigrant, local notable and artful avatar of the diverse human tide that is transforming New York City -- from the neighborhood up -- with its multiplicity of languages, religions and skills.\nHere at the end of the century, one in three city residents is an immigrant and, of those, nearly half are newly minted New Yorkers who arrived only in the last 15 years. Not since 1910, at the peak of this century's great wave of immigration through Ellis Island, has the ratio of newcomers been as high.\nSheer numbers are only the beginning of the story. No other city has absorbed so many different nationalities -- more than 100 -- since immigration laws were changed in 1965 to open the door to people from Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. And this diversity within diversity is changing the very definition of the ethnic New York neighborhood.\nClassic old ethnic neighborhoods that had successfully resisted change for half a century, now belong to no one and to everyone. They are a clashing, colorful, polyglot, multiethnic collection of microcommunities whose members sometimes come together on neutral ground like Mr. Arana's video store, and sometimes lead parallel lives.\nIn their volume and their variety, the immigrants have affected each pillar of the neighborhood architecture.\nOverburdened schools where bilingual education once was just academic theory now struggle to absorb an influx of children who do not speak English. Where once there were moribund churches and synagogues, immigrants are reinvigorating religious institutions. And the local shops, where everyone once felt at home, now must choose between serving an ethnic niche or the dissonant tastes of a multinational clientele.\nOne hundred years ago, the newest New Yorkers were largely unskilled and unlettered. They worked close to home in Lower Manhattan, with people much like themselves, so that the sweatshop and the schools became enclaves, too. As the subways and bridges extended to the thinly populated outer boroughs, ethnic neighborhoods could pick themselves up lock, stock and barrel and move onto unclaimed turf.\nThose archetypal New York ethnic neighborhoods, the stuff of the city's literature, its memoirs and its founding myths, were once urban villages of a few square blocks where immigrants lost their accents and joined the American mainstream, where everyone worshiped at the same few churches or synagogues, learned the same lessons in school and exchanged gossip at the same corner drug store.\nIf it was never quite as homogenous as some of its old-timers remember, these neighborhoods did bespeak the influence of one dominant group. For much of this century, if you were Irish-American in Woodside, Italian-American in Bensonhurst or a Jew of Russian heritage in Brighton Beach, the neighborhood felt like your turf.\nThose who now arrive in New York find a built-out city with few manufacturing jobs, where they must compete for the affordable housing they can find with native-born New Yorkers and other immigrants with whom they share little but their dreams.\nWoodside under the microscope is one churning compact sliver of the city -- less than one-fifth of a square mile bounded by Queens Boulevard, Woodside Avenue, 52nd and 64th Streets -- where the old notion of neighborhood is being deconstructed and reassembled.\nOn the Block\nA Sweet Smell As the Bars Close\nAround 4 a.m., a sweet, musty smell drifts onto the street on a light cloud of steam from the Man Mi Korean Bakery, beckoning the delivery trucks that will soon deliver the mom-and-pop shop's mung bean rice cakes and sticky sang donuts around the city.\nUp and down a seven-block stretch of Roosevelt Avenue, it is closing time for the Irish pubs. A man locks the door of the Mi Pais restaurant, pausing to stare at the picture of the voluptuous singer -- ''La Sexy de P.R.'' -- whose upcoming show is advertised on a hand-lettered poster in the window.\nDaylight brings a group of solemn girls in long blue robes and white head scarves trooping toward the Razi Islamic School, once the home of Catholic Charities and now adorned with Arabic phrases and painted tiles in feathery designs of white, yellow and blue. The manicurists in the Thai Beauty Salon prepare for their first Hispanic customers of the day as an Indian immigrant in a baseball cap arranges Greek, Arabic, Spanish and Urdu newspapers on the shelves in his convenience store. Across the street, the lights in the window of the Yuan Fu Sing grocery store flicker on, illuminating the dust on the boxes of Chinese Anti-Contusion Rheumatism Plaster and American beer.\nBy noon, all of these colors, spices and languages blend into one swirl of activity. Livery-car drivers cram into Warteg Fortuna, a tiny restaurant with eight stools, piles of Indonesian magazines and a pungent smell of curry and chili rising from behind the counter. On the side streets, where doll-size plastic statues of Jesus are nestled among the geraniums, the Irish-American retirees who first settled the neighborhood emerge to sweep up the front steps of their peaked two-family shingled homes.\nAll this diversity translates into a neighborhood with one of the city's highest proportions of immigrants: more than half of its 9,000 residents were foreign-born as of the 1990 census, and about half of those newcomers have lived in the United States for 10 years or less. Since then, the flow of immigrants into the neighborhood, and their diversity, has only increased, according to immigration records, city housing surveys and school enrollment data.\nNow, 70 percent of apartments are occupied by at least one foreign-born person. One in five children in the local elementary school, Public School 11, arrived in the country only in the last three years. Eight in 10 school-age children live in a home where the family communicates in a language other than English.\nThere has not been such a concentration of newcomers in the neighborhood since World War I, when up-and-coming Irish immigrants abandoned the tenements of Lower Manhattan for the suburban charms of Woodside's garden apartments and shaded streets of shingled homes.\nWoodside soon came to be known as ''Irishtown,'' a conceit it could preserve during the years when the city was expanding and restrictive national laws substantially slowed the flow of new immigrants. But starting in the recessionary 1970's, as the remnants of the Ellis Island generations moved away, the neighborhood became a magnet for a new wave of immigrants.\nNow, no one group can claim the neighborhood as its turf. In today's Woodside, people have different, perhaps more pragmatic, relationships to the neighborhood.\nThey are people like Elvis Jain, a 28-year-old student from India who favors pointed cowboy boots and recently dropped out of business school to open a Filipino food store on Roosevelt Avenue two blocks from St. Sebastian's Roman Catholic Church. For him, the neighborhood is a place to make money. His marketing strategy was simple: ''Filipino people are very religious, so they will always be passing by here on their way to church,'' he said.\nHere, too, are Wing and Yee Hom, immigrants from Hong Kong who bought a small house in 1981 with savings from their restaurant in Chinatown. The neighborhood offered good schools for their two children, but even now they do not feel a sense of belonging. ''Because I'm Chinese they are still not friendly,'' Mrs. Hom said. ''Sometimes I walk on the street, just a few houses below my own, and they don't want to say hello.''\nThen there are residents like Patrick Finn, whose grandparents, Irish immigrants, moved here in 1923. He can no longer name all the families on his block, but the diversity has made the neighborhood more interesting. ''It doesn't matter to me who runs the stores as long as they laugh at my jokes,'' said Mr. Finn, 46. ''Even if they don't understand them.''\nIn the Classroom\nA Teacher Seeks Common Ground\nMarlene Silverman welcomes a visitor to her classroom at P.S. 11 with a wry introduction. ''I'm the only American here,'' she says with a sweep of her arm to take in the 22 sixth graders seated in closely packed clusters of 2 and 4 at small metal desks.\nIn this small space, half of a normal classroom, are children who need to learn English. They come from India, Korea, China, Egypt, Bosnia and an array of South American countries, so many different countries that Mrs. Silverman is not sure herself who is from where.\nThey are among 300 at the school, out of a total enrollment this year of nearly 1,300 in kindergarten through sixth grade, who have been placed in bilingual classes or are assigned to teachers of English as a second language like Ms. Silverman. The goal is to get them reading and writing well enough to be transferred into regular classes within three years.\nP.S. 11, the stolid brick heart of the neighborhood, has become one of the city's most crowded schools, with as many as 46 children in a class, and one of its most linguistically diverse.\nIn Ms. Silverman's classroom, a card with ''clock'' written on it is taped to the clock. The door is labeled. So are the bookcase and the sink. Against this backdrop of order, her students come and go, separated into language groups and later recombined as a class.\nIn the morning, the Spanish-speaking children leave for special instruction in their academic subjects with a Spanish-speaking teacher. In the afternoon, the Korean and Chinese children are pulled out to study in Korean and Chinese. While they are gone, other teachers rotate into the class to help those who speak other languages, including Arabic, Urdu and Bengali.\nOrganizing their days requires the precision planning of a military campaign, but one burdened by foot soldiers who do not always understand the orders and thus progress at different speeds.\nThis morning's task is to draw a picture and write about the book the class was supposed to have read and understood, in English, the day before. It is a Chinese folk tale -- the school has decided that all classes will study China as the multicultural project of the year -- about a stone cutter named Chan Lo who wants to carve a fish from a perfect piece of jade.\nIn a far corner of the room, Sun Soo' Shin, a boy who arrived from Korea 10 months ago, has had enough of the assignment and has twisted around in his seat to pull a different book from the shelf behind him to read on his own. ''The stone,'' he has written next to a quick sketch of Chan Lo and his jade, ''is make sound like chop-chop or ss-ss. Chan Lo hear the that sound in the stone.''\nBut a group of children, flummoxed by the assignment, ignore the teacher and consult with one another quietly in Chinese. Then, together, they kneel before the book that is propped against the blackboard and all begin to meticulously copy the picture of Chan Lo on the cover. Seemingly oblivious to the activity around them, they never get to the task of writing about the story before the bell rings, 45 minutes later, for lunch.\nBehind them, an Indian immigrant named Priyank V. Shukla, dressed like all his classmates in blue jeans and sneakers, has quickly finished a minimalist sketch of a man standing by a square in which a fish floats serenely. He learned English back home, he says, so he has progressed faster at school. While he waits for his classmates to finish their drawings, he scrunches over his desk, grasps his pencil tightly in his fist and writes a dozen lines about the story.\nAt Prayer\nJoining a Church, Creating a Home\nHigh above the rows of wooden pews, where the arched mauve-and-pink rococo ceiling of St. Sebastian's Roman Catholic Church meets its pale green walls, Cheeman Kim glances at the green-robed priest below to check his timing and then leans toward the microphone.\n''Please join us in 'Jerusalem My Happy Home' on page 226,'' he announces in slow, heavily accented English, as the hundred or so worshipers at Sunday morning Mass stand up with a rustling of hymnals and shuffling of feet.\nThen he raises his arms, turns to the expectant faces of the 13 vocalists of his all-Korean choir and nods briskly to his wife, Eunsook, to play the opening chords on the organ. Their voices, strong and melodious, saturate the chapel, and an expression of sweet joy suffuses Mr. Kim's face.\nAs it has for generations of immigrants, religion provides a neighborhood within a neighborhood for people estranged by language and culture. The latest wave of immigrants has returned the favor: it has rejuvenated established churches and created new ones to reflect every conceivable national origin and permutation of faith.\nAbove the groceries and phone parlors on one block of Roosevelt Avenue, signs advertise the Choong Hyun Church, the Korean Methodist New York Agape Church and the Spanish Unity Ministerio de Cristianismo Practico. The Woodside Baptist Church, built in 1925, shares space with the Gereja Kristen Indonesia congregation. A Central American evangelical church has moved into a warehouse across the street from a body repair shop.\nFor some, the house of worship is a safe harbor where immigrants like themselves find community in a bewildering world. For others, like the Kims, the church is a stepping stone to belonging, the first American institution they dared approach where they felt at ease.\n''This is my home,'' Mr. Kim said emphatically, referring to the Woodside parish where he has now rented a home and opened a music school. ''This is my hometown.''\nThe Kims, who immigrated from Seoul eight years ago, could have joined an all-Korean Catholic church. But they chose the 104-year-old St. Sebastian's, whose pastor is the latest of an unbroken line of Irish-Americans in the job, even though it does not provide a Korean-language service.\nOne reason is their 16-year-old son, Paul, who still sings in his father's choir but speaks fluent English and is quickly picking up American teenage cultural accouterments like dyed and spiked hair. A church just for Korean immigrants -- and a neighborhood dominated by Korean immigrants -- might drive young people like him away from the fold and the family.\n''The second generation doesn't like it,'' Mr. Kim said, ''and doesn't need it.''\nThe elder Mr. Kim has begun to emerge from his immigrant shell, too. His confidence bolstered by several years of dealing with St. Sebastian officials in his halting English, he recently signed up as a community volunteer to patrol the streets of Woodside. Twice a month, he sets a flashing blue light on the roof of his car and drives around looking for trouble that the police should know about.\n''Mostly it is Korean people who get together,'' he said, ''but I am trying community groups. Because now I live and work in this location and I must be part of it.''\nIn the Stores\nMovie Rentals Bind a Community\nIf a neighborhood is a place where everybody knows your name, then Walter Arana has made this one his own.\nHe arrived from Lima, Peru, in 1979 at the age of 15, with barely enough English to navigate the airport arrivals terminal. Now, after 14 years in the business of renting videos in Woodside, he has adapted perfectly to his new environment.\nMr. Arana only needs to look around him to understand the risks in an immigrant neighborhood like Woodside with its dizzying mix of languages, national origins and tastes.\nThe Chinese immigrant who leased his store before him was a printer, but he failed because he worked only in Chinese. Across the street was a Spanish-language travel agency that gave way to a Filipino-run food store that gave way to an Ecuadorian restaurant that rarely has any customers.\n''It's very difficult to market in such a situation,'' said Mr. Arana, jangling the two thin gold chains he wears around his wrist. ''If you're selling clothing, for example, the sizes and the colors depend on who's in the neighborhood. As a product of this multicultural society, I learned as I went along.''\nWhat he learned is that each segment of the neighborhood has its quirks and preferences. Knowing them has made him a popular man and his shop a haven of neighborly comaraderie.\nOn a recent Saturday, a Mexican man climbed the stairs from the basement where the adult videos are kept and glided to the counter holding a pink video box containing a European-made pornographic film.\n''He lives with a group of guys who are here without families,'' confided Mr. Arana, as the man slipped into the fading afternoon sunshine on Roosevelt Avenue. ''The Central Americans,'' he added, revealing another bit of neighborhood intelligence, ''won't rent the American porno. Too much silicone.''\nFor his Peruvian customers, he keeps on hand a selection of the popular television variety show ''Comicos Ambulantes,'' which friends tape for him back in Lima. For some of his American-born customers who tell him they want to learn Spanish, he stocks classic comedies with minimal dialogue. For children, immigrant or not, he has English-language videos.\n''The kids pick up the language real quick,'' he explained, ''so even though they might not understand everything, they are familiar with the dialogue.''\nFor Irish immigrants in Woodside -- the old-timers who have lived there for decades and the newcomers who took advantage of special visas for the Irish in the early 1990's -- Mr. Arana orders any Irish film he can get. ''They're as sentimental as we are,'' he said. ''They want to see their own people and the same type of stories they heard when they were little.''\nSometimes when Mr. Arana goes out at night for a drink or to watch a soccer game in one of the local clubs, other customers will hail him like an old friend.\n''Usually in this country, you've got to have millions of dollars before anyone recognizes you,'' he says. ''But since I've been in the neighborhood so long, somebody always recognizes me. That's great, because otherwise you're just a Social Security number.''\nNext: The new immigrants remake a suburb in New Jersey.",
