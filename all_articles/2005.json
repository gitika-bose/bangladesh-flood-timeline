Let's take an oath: no food, no job, no shelter to Bangladeshis.\" Leaflets seeking an \"economic blockade\" of the migrants are also being distributed.\nOver the years, hundreds of thousands of illegal Bangladeshi migrants have swamped the tea-growing and oil-rich state in search for work and food.\nMore than two years ago, the government estimated there could be as many as 20 million illegal Bangladeshi immigrants in India and labeled some of them a security risk.\n\"Many laborers working in brick kilns, rickshaws pullers and construction workers have fled in the past one week due to the threat,\" said P.C. Saloi, superintendent of police in Dibrugarh.\nIn the early 1980s, the powerful All Assam Students Union began a bloody campaign to push Bangladeshis back to their homeland. Thousands of Bangladeshis, including women and children, were massacred by indigenous people who feared they would be reduced to a minority in their own land.\nThe government and the students' union signed a pact in 1985, but clauses on the deportation of foreigners have still not been implemented.\nThe campaign against the Bangladeshis has mushroomed into a full-fledged uprising against New Delhi's rule, while many rebel groups are still battling for independence.\nIndia has fenced parts of the 4,000-kilometer, or 2,500-mile, border with Bangladesh, but officials say this has done little to deter migrants bent on leaving one of the world's poorest countries.\nAssam shares a porous 272-kilometer border with Bangladesh, a vast stretch of which is unfenced.\n\"Fencing along the border with Bangladesh in this sector has started to prevent illegal infiltration,\" said India's home secretary, V.K. Duggal. \"Legal and judicial measures have also been adopted to deport illegal Bangladeshi settlers from the country.\"\nThe lush paddy fields and the sandy, shifting plains of the mighty Brahmaputra river, which divides the countries, are natural transit routes. Hundreds take rickety boats across the river, which at some places is 15 kilometers wide, into India.\nThe migrants become farmhands or river fishermen in villages. In towns they are often construction workers or rickshaw pullers, and the women work as maids.\nSince the latest campaign against Bangladeshis began, rickshaw pullers in Assam have stopped working, as havemaids, and there are shortages of eggs and chickens because most vendors were Bangladeshi. Brick kilns also have been closed because of a shortage of labor.\nThough there are no official figures of actual numbers of Bangladeshis in Assam, locals say their population could be six million of the state's 26 million people.\n\"Every day around 6,000 illegal infiltrators cross the border and enter the state,\" said an intelligence official in Guwahati, the state's main city.\nThepolice said that most of the fleeing Bangladeshis have now moved to districts close to the border with Bangladesh.\n\"The police have been put on maximum alert and instructions have been given that no genuine citizens are harassed and no communal clashes take place in disturbed areas,\" said Rockybul Hussain, Assam's interior minister.\n",

    "text": "Philip Bowring: The puzzle of Bangladesh\n2005-05-07T05:00:00.000Z\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Bangladesh is a paradox. It lacks natural resources and good governance and is beset by natural calamities, corruption and self-destructive political infighting. Yet its gross national product persistently maintains a growth rate of 5 percent, well above average for developing countries, it has overtaken India on several social indicators Its aid dependence has fallen from 6 percent to 1.8 percent of gross domestic product.\nThe answer to the puzzle seems to lie in the triumph of individual and local group initiative over both the elements and institutional failings. The frustration for many Bangladeshis is that their nation could be doing so much better. Bangladesh's attractions for foreign investors - low labor costs and stable fiscal and macro-economic policies - are countered by politically motivated strikes that paralyze the urban economy, vested trade union interests that choke its main port, inefficient textile business interests that impede its dynamic garment industry, and corrupt politicians and officials who hold up infrastructure development.\nAs it is, over the past year the nation has weathered two crises. Last summer, the worst floods in decades put more than half the country under water. But no one died, relief was effective, farmers adjusted and the economy still grew at nearly 5 percent. And this year, according to many a foreign forecast, Bangladesh's garment industry, which employs hundreds of thousands, was supposed to have been devastated by the end of textile quotas and China's export juggernaut. It is too early to make a final judgment, but so far at least the local industry appears to have maintained its share of the global market, albeit with lower profits.\nOf course this is still a desperately poor, overpopulated country, where 50 percent of children are underweight. But India is no better on that score; Bangladesh has made much more progress than its neighbors over the past 10 years, becoming self-sufficient in food. There are doubts about how much longer the farmers can continue to get additional output from their tiny plots of land of 3 percent a year. But do not be surprised if they do.\nSocial progress has been even more marked. Educational standards may be poor, but primary school enrollment is on a par with India, and completions even higher. Gender equality in education is even more striking: There are now more girls than boys at secondary level. Gender equality also seems reflected in the fall in the fertility rate, which has halved from 6.0 to 3.0 in two decades - the steepest fall almost anywhere other than China. It is now below India's and far below Pakistan's.\nThe lower birth rate is linked to a steep fall in child mortality, and to the enhanced economic role of women as small-scale village entrepreneurs and as garment workers. The conservative religious reaction to the advance of women seems unlikely to succeed in the face of educational and employment progress.\nEconomic advance has been underpinned by the individual initiative of hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshis working overseas. Their remittances exceed the net earnings of the garment industry, amounting to more than $3.5 billion a year, mostly from Britain, the United States and the Middle East. The military earns another $2 billion from UN peacekeeping missions. Bangladesh is likely to remain an exporter of people for years to come.\nBut further economic progress - including effective use of the billions earned overseas - now requires more effective governance and a freer rein for the private sector. The economy has become much more integrated with the world over the past decade but needs to move further to attract investment and exploit its only abundant resource - labor.\nThe issue now is whether Bangladesh can combine social progress with a higher level of economic growth while combating the problems of rapid urbanization and pollution in an already overcrowded land. India and Sri Lanka both suggest that in South Asia, social and economic progress do not always go hand in hand.Will Bangladesh continue as a paradox, or can it combine enterprise and a homogenous population to overcome natural adversity and set its sights on a standard of living akin to its neighbors in Southeast Asia?\n",

    "text": "News Analysis: Bangladesh tipping point is feared\n2005-08-19T05:00:00.000Z\n\nMUMBAI, India \u2014 Hundreds of bomb blasts across Bangladesh on Wednesday have triggered fresh concerns that one of the world's poorest countries is nearing a tipping point in the advance of militant Islamic fundamentalism into the mainstream of the nation's social and political life.\nAround midday on Wednesday, more than 300 crude bombs exploded nationwide, officials said, targeting symbols of public life: government buildings, courthouses and press clubs for journalists. The attacks were fastidiously planned, with hundreds of strikes condensed into a half-hour and spread across 63 of the country's 64 districts.\nBut the attacks, attributed to Islamic militant groups, also appeared to be deliberately mild, killing 2 people and wounding about 100. That blend of adept execution and willful restraint is prompting some analysts to suggest that the culprits are not fringe actors seeking to maximize violence but Islamist fundamentalists making a political show of force.A leaflet found at one bomb site, attributed to Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen, a banned militant group, argued for the use of Shariah, or Islamic law: \"It is time to implement Islamic law in Bangladesh. There is no future with manmade law.\" On Thursday, the police told news agencies that they had detained dozens of suspected militants, including members of Jamaat.\nAs the world's third-largest Muslim-majority nation with a population that is 90 percent Muslim, Bangladesh casts itself as a moderate Muslim democracy. But it appears to be witnessing the rise and mainstreaming of an Islamist political movement, analysts say.\n\"There are warning signs and indicators that things could go in those directions,\" a Western diplomat posted in the capital, Dhaka, said in a telephone interview, granted on a condition of anonymity imposed by his government. \"We're certainly not at the point where Afghanistan was a couple of years ago. Could we be 10 years from now? It's certainly possible. There is no one here who would say that's absurd.\"\nThe Bush administration has shown growing concern over that possibility. In June, it sent Nicholas Burns, under secretary of state for political affairs, to Dhaka. Brahma Chellaney, a professor of strategic studies at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi, said Burns told him before the Dhaka visit that he planned to send a \"very tough message\" to Bangladesh's prime minister, Begum Khaleda Zia, on rising extremism.\nAnalysts contend that a conservative strain of Islam is on the rise in Bangladesh, a flood-prone South Asian nation of 138 million people, more than half of whom live in poverty.\nMadrassas, or religious schools, are fast proliferating. Women are ever more likely to wear head scarves and to spurn jeans out of fear. Members of the governing coalition are accused by critics of, at best, tolerating and, at worst, conniving with Islamist extremist groups.\nThose trends have been punctuated by a growing number of bomb and grenade attacks against supposed allies of a conservative brand of Islam: the Awami League, an opposition party; journalists; and nongovernmental organizations.\nBut Wednesday's attacks stood out in two ways. First, they signaled the potency and sophistication of the militant groups. Second, they suggested, in their restraint, a desire to make gains through politics rather than by violence.\n\"Whoever are these shadowy actors, they obviously have a capacity - it is probably a rehearsal,\" said Hossain Zillur Rahman, a political sociologist at the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies in Dhaka.\"People are not very clear to what extent this is part of that political game, or whether this is the arrival of a new actor on the scene.\"\nThe \"political game\" refers to speculation that militant groups in Bangladesh have the tacit support of mainstream political parties\nZia, the prime minister, condemned the attackers as \"enemies of the country, people, peace, humanity and democracy.\" But her government, which came to power by articulating a muscular, hard-line foreign policy that was tougher on India than her predecessor's, has alliances with conservative Muslim parties that have links, security experts contend, to extremist groups. As in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the evidence of tangible links is nearly impossible to come by, but suspicion that some extremists operate with official support is commonplace.\n\"It's sort of a warning shot that these fundamentalists have fired, warning this government with which they have a political alliance that if the government doesn't really implement Islamic law, they will be able to execute a major act of terrorism across Bangladesh,\" said Chellaney, the professor. \"They have become so empowered in the last few years that they feel emboldened to demand Shariah.\"\nAnalysts of South Asian geopolitics contend that Bangladesh may be following a pattern seen in Afghanistan: mounting extremism in domestic politics, amplified by the arrival of foreigners who provide money and inspiration.\nWith U.S. military forces hunting extremists in Afghanistan and Pakistan's president, General Pervez Musharraf, pledging to stamp out fundamentalism in his country, Muslim extremists in South Asia are \"moving, searching for new pastures,\" said A.N. Ram, a retired 36-year veteran of India's diplomatic corps. \"There is pressure on these elements in Afghanistan, pressure in Pakistan. Here is a country where they can operate freely, with little pressure.\"\nRam added: \"Unless something is done now, and very soon, events may overtake us and the state of Bangladesh may become hopelessly embroiled in the vicious circle for fundamentalism, terrorism and the dangers they pose to all of us.\"\nWednesday's attacks continue the unrest in South Asia that is blamed for the region's failure to follow East and Southeast Asia in moving beyond political instability and refocusing on building deeper political and economic links.\nSri Lanka's foreign minister was murdered this week. Nepal is in the grips of a Maoist rebellion that prompted its monarch to impose emergency rule this year. Afghanistan and Pakistan are flash points of the Bush administration's war on terror, with Pakistan recently accused of having provided shelter to the suicide bombers in the July 7 London attacks.Meanwhile, Myanmar's junta grows ever more isolated from the international community.\n",

    "text": "In Europe, High-Tech Flood Control, With Nature's Help\n2005-09-06T05:00:00.000Z\nOn a cold winter night in 1953, the Netherlands suffered a terrifying blow as old dikes and seawalls gave way during a violent storm.\nFlooding killed nearly 2,000 people and forced the evacuation of 70,000 others. Icy waters turned villages and farm districts into lakes dotted with dead cows.\nUltimately, the waters destroyed more than 4,000 buildings.\nAfterward, the Dutch -- realizing that the disaster could have been much worse, since half the country, including Amsterdam and Rotterdam, lies below sea level -- vowed never again.\nAfter all, as Tjalle de Haan, a Dutch public works official, put it in an interview last week, \"Here, if something goes wrong, 10 million people can be threatened.\"\nSo at a cost of some $8 billion over a quarter century, the nation erected a futuristic system of coastal defenses that is admired around the world today as one of the best barriers against the sea's fury -- one that could withstand the kind of storm that happens only once in 10,000 years.\nThe Dutch case is one of many in which low-lying cities and countries with long histories of flooding have turned science, technology and raw determination into ways of forestalling disaster.\nLondon has built floodgates on the Thames River. Venice is doing the same on the Adriatic.\nJapan is erecting superlevees. Even Bangladesh has built concrete shelters on stilts as emergency havens for flood victims.\nExperts in the United States say the foreign projects are worth studying for inspiration about how to rebuild New Orleans once the deadly waters of Hurricane Katrina recede into history.\n\"They have something to teach us,\" said George Z. Voyiadjis, head of civil and environmental engineering at Louisiana State University. \"We should capitalize on them for building the future here.\"\nInnovations are happening in the United States as well. California is experimenting with \"smart\" levees wired with nervous systems of electronic sensors that sound alarms if a weakening levee threatens to open a breach, giving crews time to make emergency repairs.\n\"It's catching on,\" said William F. Kane, president of Kane GeoTech Inc., a company in Stockton, Calif., that wires levees and other large structures with failure sensors. \"There's a lot of potential for this kind of thing.\"\nWhile scientists hail the power of technology to thwart destructive forces, they note that flood control is a job for nature at least as much as for engineers. Long before anyone built levees and floodgates, barrier islands were serving to block dangerous storm surges. Of course, those islands often fall victim to coastal development.\n\"You'll never be able to control nature,\" said Rafael L. Bras, an environmental engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who consults on the Venetian project. \"The best way is to understand how nature works and make it work in our favor.\"\nIn humanity's long struggle against the sea, the Dutch experience in 1953 was a grim milestone. The North Sea flood produced the kind of havoc that became all too familiar on the Gulf Coast last week. When a crippled dike threatened to give way and let floodwaters spill into Rotterdam, a boat captain -- like the brave little Dutch boy with the quick finger -- steered his vessel into the breach, sinking his ship and saving the city.\n\"We were all called upon to collect clothes and food for the disaster victims,\" recalled Jelle de Boer, a Dutch high school student at the time who is now an emeritus professor of geology at Wesleyan University. \"Cows were swimming around. They'd stand when they could, shivering and dying. It was a terrible mess.\"\nThe reaction was intense and manifold. Linking offshore islands with dams, seawalls and other structures, the Dutch erected a kind of forward defensive shield, drastically reducing the amount of vulnerable coastline. Mr. de Haan, director of the water branch of the Road and Hydraulic Engineering Institute of the Dutch Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management, said the project had the effect of shortening the coast by more than 400 miles.\nFor New Orleans, experts say, a similar forward defense would seal off Lake Pontchartrain from the Gulf of Mexico. That step would eliminate a major conduit by which hurricanes drive storm surges to the city's edge -- or, as in the case of Katrina, through the barriers.\nThe Dutch also increased the height of their dikes, which now loom as much as 40 feet above the churning sea. (In New Orleans, the tallest flood walls are about half that size.) The government also erected vast complexes of floodgates that close when the weather turns violent but remain open at other times, so saltwater can flow into estuaries, preserving their ecosystems and the livelihoods that depend on them.\nThe Netherlands maintains large teams of inspectors and maintenance crews that safeguard the sprawling complex, which is known as Delta Works. The annual maintenance bill is about $500 million. \"It's not cheap,\" Mr. de Haan said. \"But it's not so much in relation to the gross national product. So it's a kind of insurance.\"\nThe 1953 storm also pounded Britain. Along the Thames, flooding killed more than 300 people, ruined farmland and frightened Londoners, whose central city narrowly escaped disaster.\nThe British responded with a plan to better regulate tidal surges sweeping up the Thames from the North Sea. Engineers designed an attractive barrier meant to minimize interference with the river's natural flow. It went into service in 1982 at Woolwich, about 10 miles east of central London.\nNormally, its semicircular gates lie flush to the riverbed in concrete supporting sills, creating no obstacle to river traffic. When the need arises, the gates pivot up, rising as high as a five-story building to block rising waters. The authorities have raised the Thames barrier more than 80 times.\nIn Venice, the precipitating event was a 1966 flood that caused wide damage and economic loss. The upshot was an ambitious plan known as the Moses Project, named after the biblical parting of the Red Sea. Its 78 gargantuan gates would rest on the floor of the Adriatic Sea and rise when needed to block dangerous tidal surges.\nLong debate over the project's merits repeatedly delayed the start of construction until May 2003. Opponents claim that the $4.5 billion effort will prove ineffective while threatening to kill the fragile lagoon in which Venice sits. In theory, the gates are to be completed by 2010.\n\"People fight doing things like this,\" said Dr. Bras, of M.I.T. \"But when disaster strikes you realize how important it is to think ahead.\"\nPlanners did just that in Bangladesh after a 1991 hurricane created huge storm surges that killed more than 130,000 people. World charities helped build hundreds of concrete shelters on stilts, which in recent storms have saved thousands of lives.\nIn Japan, a continuous battle against flooding in dense urban areas has produced an effort to develop superlevees. Unlike the customary mounds of earth, sand and rock that hold back threatening waters, they are broad expanses of raised land meant to resist breaks and withstand overflows.\nThe approach being tried in California relies on a technology known as time-domain reflectometry. It works on the same principle as radar: a pulse of energy fired down a coaxial cable bounces back when it reaches the end or a distortion, like a bend or crimp.\nCareful measurement of the echoes traveling back along the cable can disclose serious distortions and danger. Dr. Kane, of Kane GeoTech, has installed such a system in the Sacramento River delta, along a levee that is threatening to fail.\nCould such a system have saved New Orleans? \"It would have given them more information,\" said Charles H. Dowding, a top expert on the technology at Northwestern University. \"The failure of a levee would have been detected.\" But experts say it is still unclear whether such a warning would have been enough to prevent the catastrophic breaches.\nDr. Bras says sensor technologies for detecting levee failure hold much promise. But he adds that less glamorous approaches, like regular maintenance, may be even more valuable, since prevention is always the best cure.\n\"We have to learn that things have to be reviewed, revised, maintained and repaired as needed,\" he said. \"To see a city like New Orleans suffer such devastation -- some of that was preventable.\"\nHe added that no matter how ambitious the coastal engineering, no matter how innovative and well maintained, the systems of levees, seawalls and floodgates were likely to suffer sporadic failures.\n\"Nature will throw big things at us once in a while,\" he said. \"There's always the possibility that nature will trump us.\"",

    "text": "Philip Bowring: Chinese lessons\n2005-04-09T05:00:00.000Z\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 The current 10-day, four-nation tour of South Asia by China's prime minister, Wen Jiabao, is at one level a triumphal affair. Here is the outwardly modest Wen basking in China's success, spreading the gospel of good will to these neighbors whose combined populations equals that of China. Here is a China that will give aid, help them escape from poverty, make Asians proud and speak up for multilateralism and the United Nations system - articles of faith throughout the subcontinent.\nBut Wen's tour is also a reminder that China's global economic influence is now a factor in relations between the states of South Asia in a way that China's ideology never was. It thus presents India, anxious both to develop its strategic relationship with the United States and be the leader of South Asian economic integration, with awkward balancing acts.\nWen will visit India last but longest, flattering Indian egos with a trip to high-tech Bangalore and hearing eloquent Indian rhetoric about a new era of Asian cooperation driven by mutual economic interests. Trade has indeed been increasing rapidly as China sells manufactured goods and buys iron ore from India. Commerce may keep border disputes and Beijing's ambiguous attitude to enlargement of the UN Security Council - which India hopes to join - in the background.\nBut Wen's visits to Pakistan and Bangladesh may be at least as significant in suggesting to India that a new attitude to its immediate neighbors is needed if the subcontinent is to get back on a par with China. Wen reaffirmed the strength of relations with Pakistan despite its improved relationship with Washington and past support for the Taliban. He was keen, too, to emphasize that South Asian countries should \"treat each other as equals,\" a jab at India that went down well in Pakistan and in Bangladesh - which feels that it is treated by India as the United States used to treat Mexico.\nBangladesh is particularly in need of China's moral support. There is an impression among diplomats here that India's recent rapprochement with Pakistan has caused New Delhi's propaganda and intelligence machines to turn more attention to the alleged misdeeds of its eastern neighbor. On scant evidence, Bangladesh is accused of harboring insurgents in India's long-troubled northeastern states and of flooding these states with illegal migrants.\nIndia has endeavored - without success - to persuade the United States that Bangladesh is on the way to becoming a failed state of Muslim fundamentalists and assorted gunmen. There is a belief here, not confined to nationalist Bangladeshis, that India does not want Bangladesh to be successful as it would demonstrate the potential for relatively small homogenous states on the subcontinent and would show up the failures of Bihar and other adjoining Indian states.\nBangladesh cannot escape dependence on India, which almost entirely surrounds it. It needs more Indian investment and cross-border trade to integrate markets. Links to Myanmar, Thailand and China will grow but are no substitute. Many Indo-Bangladeshi disputes are petty or over matters that neither government fully controls, such as smuggling of goods and people. But one big issue could drive Bangladesh to seek much closer links with China - the rivers that are its lifeblood.\nIndia's plans to link river systems include diverting water from the Brahmaputra, Bangladesh's single largest water source, into the Ganges. Although India is being urged - most recently in a World Bank report - to cooperate with its neighbors in sharing waters and developing hydroelectric potential, it has a tendency to treat Bangladesh as at best a little brother and at worst a vassal state. That's where the Chinese come in. The headwaters of the Brahmaputra are in Tibet. Should China thus not also be party to water-sharing talks? That is not on New Delhi's cooperation agenda.\nIt is clearly not in China's interest to be drawn deeply into South Asian disputes. But its prestige and its appearance of benevolence, magnanimity and success suggest that the newly confident, outward-looking India needs new approaches to its neighbors. Can India learn from Wen's triumphant progress through the region that it claims to lead?\n",

    "text": "Hearts, Minds and Flood Relief\n2005-01-09T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE best thing to happen to the image of the United States in the Muslim world last week may have been the stupidity of one lost water buffalo.\nAfter the cow closed the airport in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, by fatally colliding with the landing gear of an aid plane, helicopters from the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln swooped in to save the day, delivering tons of food to victims of the Dec. 26 tsunami.\nAnd, as noted by the British Broadcasting Corporation (better known and better trusted than most American news media), the pilots even disregarded a government demand that they stop rescuing injured villagers because the city hospital was full. Instead, they brought dozens back to a field station hastily set up by Navy doctors.\nNews photographers were allowed to capture it all, of course, and the pictures flashed around the world.\nAs he toured the devastated region last week, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell acknowledged after some prodding that he also hoped the American aid effort would help rebuild a relationship with the Islamic world that has crumbled into desert dust and gunpowder.\n\"We'd be doing it regardless of religion,\" Mr. Powell said. \"But I think it does give the Muslim world and the rest of the world an opportunity to see American generosity, American values in action.\"\nIt won't hurt, said a half-dozen experts on Islamic politics in the United States, Egypt, Turkey and Lebanon, but it probably won't help, either. As any reader of Middle Eastern tales knows, beach debris can be dangerous: the genie in the bottle may grant your wish -- or take out years of pent-up fury on you.\nAlso, the recent history of American humanitarian efforts in Muslim societies is not a happy one.\nA mission to feed war-torn Somalia disintegrated into the infamous \"Black Hawk Down\" shootout, bodies dragged in the streets and a quick departure.\nThe slaughter of Muslim Bosnians and Muslim Kosovars by Orthodox Serbs in the former Yugoslavia was halted by American bombing. But the world never saw the operation as a rescue of Muslims, because the conflict was so intra-European, albeit along fault lines created by the former Ottoman Empire.\nThe invasion of Afghanistan was seen as a hunt for Osama bin Laden, with development money and a dash of democracy added because the Taliban had to be toppled.\nMore important, all the experts said that anti-Americanism in Muslim countries is rooted in real anger over real policies: America's unwavering support for Israel, the war in Iraq, torture at Abu Ghraib and support for corrupt but pro-American regimes.\n\"To think that aid would make people overlook all the other reasons to criticize the U.S. -- it's na\u00efve, it's racist, it's almost insulting,\" said Rami G. Khouri, editor of The Star in Beirut. \"We admire the U.S. for a lot of things, including its generosity. But even if it doubles its aid, we're still going to criticize it for its policies.\"\nAt the same time, said Abdel Moneim Said, director of the Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo, \"sophisticated people, people with influence, can distinguish between the U.S., whose image is humanistic, and the policies of the Bush administration.\"\nParenthetically, it should be noted that, with the exception of Indonesia, the hardest-hit areas are not Muslim. Sri Lanka's separatist Tamils are mostly Hindus and its ruling Sinhalese mostly Buddhists. India's southeast coast is largely Hindu, with many Christians. Most Thais are Buddhist, and in that country, about half of the tsunami's victims were foreigners. The wave virtually missed the heavily Muslim shorelines of Bangladesh and Malaysia.\nStill, the world is watching, and while the United States would have hurt its image by doing little, it may not gain much by doing a lot.\n\"People are used to seeing the U.S. insignia on bags of rice during famines,\" said Michael A. Sells, an expert on Islam at Haverford College. Initially scorned as stingy for offering only $15 million, the United States raised its ante several times, eventually reaching $350 million, plus whatever the Pentagon spends. International meetings began to sound like a pledge banquet with a pass-around microphone.\nBut conspicuously absent in the bidding wars were the oil-rich Arab states and Islamic charities, and Egyptian and Turkish papers chided their governments for doing so little -- in Turkey's case, for even failing to observe the three minutes of silence for the victims that Europe held, according to Ilter Turan, a professor of political science at Istanbul's Biligi University.\nThe Gulf States should pledge $3 billion, Mr. Khouri insisted. \"Asian workers built those countries,\" he said.\nAt the same time, leadership in heroic humanitarian missions carries risks. American personnel in Aceh could find themselves in yet another land full of explosive, mission-damaging surprises.\nAceh separatists seeking an Islamic state fought Jakarta during the decades when Indonesia was a staunch American ally in the cold war. The 40,000 government troops controlling the province have been accused by Human Rights Watch of torture, kidnappings and secret executions. Now those troops are working in the relief effort, so the American military must work with them -- and conceivably, with the guerrillas they were just hunting.\nNor is fundamentalism limited to Aceh. The Islamic Defenders Front, a Jakarta group running its own small aid efforts, was quoted by Al Jazeera as saying that it expected female American sailors to wear concealing black robes. That was ignored, and one would append \"of course,\" except that until 2002, American military women in Saudi Arabia were required to wear black robes and head scarves when off base.\nLate reports from Banda Aceh said that relief efforts there were fraying because overlapping European charities and United Nations agencies lacked a clear command structure, and had rejected the one offered by the U.S. Navy to avoid appearing to be instruments of an American military operation.\nTo add another highly touchy subject: Aceh is a center of human trafficking to Southeast Asia's sweatshops and child brothels, and there have already been reports of children kidnapped from refugee camps.\nAND, in a disturbing echo of the Sept. 11 canard that thousands of Jews were warned to stay away from the World Trade Center, rumors have circulated that the tsunami was set off by an American or Israeli nuclear test. The supposed proof was the warning of the coming wave received by the American military base on Diego Garcia.\nThere is one Muslim country that will surely not be moved by images of American beneficence. In Iraq, where electricity for televisions is intermittent and the war is still the front-page news, there was little evidence that people were paying attention to tsunami relief.\nIn Falluja, Iraqis returning to their ruined homes were given one bottle of water and one emergency food pack per person, and a set of yellow flowered sheets for each family. To children, the Marines gave lollipops.",

    "text": "Why the Chicken Virus Crossed the Border\n2005-11-22T05:00:00.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh - POOR countries are failing in their efforts to stop avian flu from spreading to humans. Yesterday, Indonesian doctors reported an eighth human death from the disease in that country; if confirmed, it would be the 68th avian flu death worldwide. In Bangladesh, we have yet to see the virus on our poultry farms. When we do, we will have to confront the same public health crisis that Indonesia and other countries face now.\nThe government of Bangladesh has prudently banned the import of poultry from all countries that have declared bird flu outbreaks, as well as from a few countries that are suspected of covering up outbreaks. But because the virus can also be spread by migratory birds, it seems inevitable that it will eventually reach Bangladesh. And we in the industry know that vaccinating chickens, as Indonesia has done and China now proposes to do, will not prevent human deaths.\nFirst, flu viruses mutate frequently; a particular vaccine may match the field virus for just a few months, after which it will be less effective. And even when the vaccine does match, it is possible for an inoculated flock to include a few unprotected birds that replicate enough virus to spread the disease to farm workers and surrounding farms. This can happen because workers injecting vaccines do not always use the correct technique when they grow tired or bored; or because even correctly vaccinated chickens may not have an immune response if they are malnourished or stressed by crowding. Because the disease will kill only the few unprotected chickens, its presence on farms that have used the vaccine may go unnoticed until farm workers or neighboring households are infected. That is probably why humans are still periodically dying of bird flu in Indonesia despite the vaccinations there.\nMany Indonesians raise chickens in their backyards or keep pet birds in cages. If the virus spreads among these birds, their human owners could be exposed, thus increasing the probability that a person could become simultaneously infected with bird flu and human flu. Such an infection might result in an exchange of genes between viruses, which could create the dreaded (and as yet unseen) pandemic flu virus. To prevent a pandemic, the trickle of human infections must be stopped before it becomes a flood.\nThe best strategy for stopping bird flu is to cull all poultry and pet birds, even healthy ones, within a wide radius of each detected outbreak. But in a country like Indonesia, where annual per capita income is only about $1,140, farmers will not kill healthy chickens without compensation. And the Indonesian government cannot afford to pay for healthy chickens to be culled. So human infections -- and the threat of a pandemic -- will continue.\nWhat will happen when the bird flu virus spreads to Bangladesh, where the annual per capita income is only $440? There are more than 100,000 small poultry farms in Bangladesh, producing $400 million worth of chickens and $300 million worth of eggs every year. The government is watching carefully for bird flu, but it will not have the funds to cull poultry when an outbreak is detected. Its only realistic option will be to import vaccines so that farmers can protect their investments. As in Indonesia, vaccinated chickens will be largely protected, but humans will periodically become infected. Periodically, that is, until a pandemic begins.\nTo avert this, North America and Western Europe need to help Asian governments pay for an effective bird flu eradication program. This will be very expensive, because farmers have to be compensated for destroying millions of healthy chickens in affected areas. However, it would stop periodic bird flu infections in humans.\nAid donors should require Asian governments to commit to surveillance for, and honest reporting of, avian influenza outbreaks. Thailand did not admit to having a bird flu problem until the first human case was confirmed in January 2004. If the Thai authorities had announced outbreaks among poultry months earlier, it might have been possible to stop the spread of the disease before there were any human deaths in Thailand.\nMy family started a business breeding day-old chicks in the late 1990's. We reinvested all our profits and expanded rapidly until human cases of bird flu were confirmed in Thailand in 2004. The news panicked Bangladeshi consumers. Chicken consumption plummeted. Our company was forced to cull 860,000 healthy chicks because they simply could not be sold. The consumer panic eventually ended, and demand recovered. But the experience has convinced me that the poultry industry in Asia will remain viable only in countries that can protect humans from bird flu.\nUnfortunately, denial has been the knee-jerk reaction in many Asian countries. We in the industry have credible reports of bird flu outbreaks on farms in countries that have not reported the disease. A well-financed and organized effort in cooperation with farmers is the only way to keep the number of human cases from mounting.\nOp-Ed Contributor Zahin Hasan directs the production operations of the largest poultry breeder in Bangladesh.",

    "text": "Stream of Chinese Textile Imports Is Becoming a Flood\n2005-04-04T05:00:00.000Z\nSHANGHAI, April 3 - Imports of Chinese textile and apparel products into the United States soared in the first quarter, offering fresh evidence that the world's clothing trade is being drastically reshaped by the abolition of global quotas in January.\nThe United States Commerce Department said Friday that in the first three months of the year, preliminary data showed that United States imports of textile and apparel products from China rose more than 63 percent from a year ago.\nIn some crucial categories previously governed by the old system of country-by-country quotas, like underwear, cotton trousers and cotton knit shirts, the increases were even more stark -- jumps of as much as 2,000 percent.\nThe figures are certain to heighten trade tensions between the countries and also to renew calls for the United States government to place restrictions on some Chinese imports to protect American manufacturing jobs.\nThe Bush administration said last week that it was closely monitoring textile and apparel imports from China to better assess the effect on the nation's textile and apparel industry.\nTrade relations between the two countries are already tense, partly because the United States trade deficit with China reached a record $162 billion last year, making it the largest trade imbalance ever recorded by the United States with a single country.\nEuropean officials are also weighing some form of trade restriction to stem the equally large flood of Chinese textile and apparel imports into the European Union.\nIn China, textile officials are trying to play down the significance of recent trade data, saying that it could be distorted because factories ramped up production early in the year out of fears that import restrictions could be put in place later in the year.\n\"Last year, when foreign buyers and Chinese producers made deals, the orders were mostly for half a year, different from before when the orders were always for a complete year,\" Cao Xinyu, deputy director for the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Textiles, said in a telephone interview Friday. \"This was because foreign buyers as well as Chinese textile companies are uncertain about the future.\"\nTrade specialists have long predicted that once quotas ended, China's efficient, low-cost manufacturing operations would dominate the world's $495 billion textile and apparel trade, wiping out manufacturing operations in the United States, Europe and elsewhere.\nLast year, Chinese textile and apparel imports into the United States were valued at about $17 billion, accounting for about 20 percent of all American clothing imports.\nAnalysts are now predicting a surge in Chinese textile and apparel exports to the rest of the world that could wipe out production in some poorer countries, like Bangladesh and Cambodia. Some analysts believe Chinese imports could eventually account for as much as 70 percent of America's textile and apparel imports.\nHoping to reposition themselves in this new world, American and European retailers and clothing makers have already begun buying a growing share of their textile and apparel goods directly from Chinese factories at reduced costs. Consumers in the West are beginning to see cheaper prices for some clothing like jeans and leather jackets.\nMany American and European apparel makers say they are also outsourcing to other poor countries just in case the United States or Europe place trade restrictions on China. But eventually, they say, China will dominate the clothing trade.\n\"We will always go to the least expensive place,\" said Roger Williams, president of Warnaco Swimwear, a division of Warnaco, one of the world's biggest apparel makers. \"Once the issue of safeguards is settled, our comfort level will go up. There will be a shift to China over time.\"\nThe Commerce Department's statistics are the latest in a series of government data showing a shift already under way.\nLast week, the Chinese government also released figures showing that in the first two months of the year, its global textile and apparel exports rose 31 percent to nearly $14 billion, up from $10.5 billion in 2004.\nThe bulk of those gains came from rising exports to the United States and Europe, which, in the first two months of the year have soared 56 percent over the same period in 2003, to $4.8 billion this year.\nAmong the early losers in the textile trade so far are Mexico and several Central American nations, which have begun to see their share of textile and apparel trade with the United States eroded by China, according to Commerce Department figures.\nThere are still about 665,000 textile and apparel manufacturing jobs in America, according to textile officials. But most specialists say they think those jobs are likely to vanish within a few years.\nLast week, the National Council of Textile Organizations said that 17,000 American jobs had already been lost this year after 11 textile and apparel plants were closed because they could not compete.\nTrade groups representing American workers want the federal government to step in because they think Chinese manufactures unfairly dominate the textile trade by using cheap labor and relying on government subsidies.\n\"These numbers are as bad as we feared,\" said Cass Johnson, a spokesman for the National Council of Textile Organizations in Washington. \"The government needs to initiate safeguard action now or we could lose tens of thousands of jobs.\"",

    "text": "Free of Quota, China Textiles Flood the U.S.\n2005-03-10T05:00:00.000Z\nSHANGHAI, March 9 - In the first month after the end of all quotas on textiles and apparel around the world, imports to the United States from China jumped about 75 percent, according to trade figures released by the Chinese government.\nThe statistics bear some of the first evidence that China's booming textile and apparel trade, unhampered by quotas, could be prepared to dominate the global textile trade and add to trade tensions around the world. The quotas came to an end on Dec. 31 as a result of an international agreement reached in 1993.\nIn January, the United States imported more than $1.2 billion in textiles and apparel from China, up from about $701 million a year ago. Imports of major apparel products from China jumped 546 percent. Last January, for example, China shipped 941,000 cotton knit shirts, which were limited by quotas; this January, it shipped 18.2 million, a 1,836 percent increase. Imports of cotton knit trousers were up 1,332 percent from a year ago.\nThese figures may be understated because China ships a large part of its goods through Hong Kong, and those shipments are not included.\nFears that China is going to flood the world market with cheap textile exports have already inflamed tensions between Washington and Beijing because of worries about American manufacturing plants being closed and thousands of jobs being lost.\nAlready, in January, the first month after global quotas were lifted, 12,200 jobs were lost in the United States apparel and textile industries, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Some analysts have predicted that China could capture as much as 70 percent of the American market in the next two years. Before the end of quotas, about 16 percent of apparel sold in the United States came from China.\nLast year, the United States trade deficit with China set a record of $162 billion, making it the largest trade imbalance ever recorded by the United States with a single country. To be sure, some textile importers say this phenomenon may be a one-time surge. Companies, for instance, may have put off shipping goods at the end of last year to avoid the quotas.\n\"Nobody knows if it's going to last,\" said Andrew Grossman, who runs GAV, a company that designs and manufactures clothes for Calvin Klein and Emanuel Ungaro. \"So you're not seeing it passed on to the consumer.\"\nBecause of uncertainty over currency fluctuations and the process of lifting quotas, apparel producers like GAV have not reduced their prices to retailers. Moreover, poor countries like Bangladesh, Cambodia and Sri Lanka are pressing Washington to pass legislation giving them lower tariffs to help support a crucial source of their livelihood. Some trade experts say that China has achieved its status over the years by providing questionable bank loans and subsidies to its industry.\nStill, it is clear that efforts to move toward more open trade have freed China and other countries of many textile and apparel quotas and restrictions. And they have set the stage for China to become a global textile and apparel behemoth, lowering clothing prices for consumers around the world but upsetting and rewriting current trade balances.\nThe January evidence showed blockbuster gains for Chinese textile and apparel makers -- a surge that some textile experts had been predicting long before the quotas came to an end.\nThe 25 countries that are part of the European Union also registered big increases, importing about $1.4 billion worth of textile and apparel goods from China, up from about $975 million a year ago, a jump of 46 percent.\n\"This is not a surprise; it is not a revelation,\" said Donald Brasher, president of Global Trade Information Services in Columbia, S.C., which tracks and releases trade figures from around the world and was the first to publish China's official trade statistics. \"We're going from a quota regime to a quota-free regime. And China's one of the most competitive producers. What do you expect?\"\nBut representatives of some of the nation's biggest textile and apparel manufacturers say the figures seem to bear out their worst fears: what they see as China's unfair dominance of the world textile trade because of possible currency undervaluation and government subsidies of big textile operations in China.\n\"The wolf is at the door and only the U.S. government can slam it shut, and it needs to do it right now,\" said Cass Johnson, president of the National Council of Textile Organizations, a trade group that is pressing the administration to impose immediate limits on Chinese imports.\n\"The action the government takes or doesn't take will affect 30 million workers around the world and perhaps half a million in this country.\"\n\"This isn't like the Y-2K crisis where everyone was afraid of a computer meltdown that never happened,\" Mr. Johnson added. \"This is happening and the consequences are frightening.\"\nIn January alone, China shipped more apparel in some categories, like cotton trousers, than it had in the previous year and a half, representing approximately a fourteenfold increase, according to Mr. Johnson's trade group. For instance, China sent nearly 27 million pairs of cotton trousers to the United States; the quota had held the number to 1.9 million a year ago. There were also big increases in everything from underwear to gowns.\nChina's customs figures, which were released March 1 to Global Trade Information Services, are often the earliest indication of China's exports to the United States.\nThis Friday, the Commerce Department is expected to release its own trade data with China. However, the figures could include Chinese apparel that was shipped in December, before quotas ended, but that landed in the United States in January. Those figures might show less spectacular jumps in trade with the United States, according to textile industry officials.\nMany Democrats in Congress say that imports from China are the biggest trade problem for the United States. Representative Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the trade subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in an interview that he would push the administration to pay more attention to China's trading practices.\nSome American manufacturers say that China is increasing exports by undervaluing its currency, which makes its products cheaper in dollars for American companies.\nThe Bush administration says it has put pressure on Chinese officials to revalue their currency and take steps on other trade issues. Moreover, the administration did agree last year to put limits on some Chinese textile and apparel imports in advance of any market disruption.\nBut importers and retailers, particularly the National Retail Federation, persuaded the Court of International Trade to issue an injunction against the administration's limits. Still, a continued surge in Chinese imports could lead to another push by the administration to provide relief for American apparel and textile manufacturers. If the surge is temporary, the administration is less likely to apply limits.\nBrenda Jacobs, the Washington trade counsel to the U.S. Association of Importers of Textiles and Apparel, said she was wary of the new Chinese figures and would wait to see the United States trade figures, which will be released on Friday.\n\"I just don't know what to expect; there will be shifting of production,\" said Ms. Jacobs, whose group supported the end of quotas. \"But put this in context -- there were a lot of companies that held off shipping goods in December in order to be sure they would not be caught in the quota system.\"",

    "text": "We can minimize natural disasters\n2005-12-31T05:00:00.000Z\n\nSTOCKHOLM \u2014 On the first anniversary of the tsunami in South Asia, the news media propounded the conventional wisdom that we are powerless in the face of natural disasters, especially in the developing world. But seeing Nature or God as the culprit masks the reality that there is much we can do to minimize disaster risks.\nNatural hazards like earthquakes and extreme weather events are beyond human control, but we can keep them from turning into full-fledged disasters by reducing the vulnerability of populations.\nGovernments and international organizations should start paying serious attention to studies showing the importance of disaster preparedness.\nThe main problem is that nobody seems to feel responsibility for putting disasters into broader perspective. Humanitarian organizations put almost all their efforts into emergency relief, and development organizations don't see protection against disaster as a priority. Great disasters attract a lot of media attention, but prevention and preparedness get almost none.\nDisaster prevention programs might seem to be luxuries for impoverished countries. But there are many examples of communities and countries that have created effective ways to reduce risks and save lives, and in the process, save a lot of money. According to the Tearfund, a British development group, for every dollar spent on prevention a further $4 to $10 can be saved on relief and reconstruction.\nDeveloping countries are by far the hardest hit by natural disasters. Of more than two million people killed in natural disasters in the last 20 years, 98 percent were from poor countries. The number of deaths, however, is just the tip of the iceberg. For every death there are usually 2,000 to 3,000 people severely affected.\nIndustrialized countries are hit as well, but as countries become more prosperous they are better able to afford the investments needed for prevention and preparedness. A major earthquake in Iran, Turkey or Pakistan may kill tens of thousands of people. A similar quake in Japan or California normally kills only a few hundred at most. Better urban planning and stricter building codes explain the difference.\nNatural disasters already exert an enormous toll on development, and they are on the increase. Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurance company, estimates that the number of major disasters has quadrupled since 1960. Economic losses have increased eight-fold.\nWorse yet, disaster risks are expected to grow still more with global warming. Extreme weather events will become more frequent and the major consequences will be suffered by developing countries. It is estimated that, by 2025, more than half the population of developing countries will live in areas at high risk for hurricanes and floods.\nDeforestation, in particular in mountainous catchment areas, will lead to severe flooding. And droughts hit much harder in regions where forests and trees are gone and where topsoil is badly eroded. Those are problems that could be improved by development policy decisions. Experience in Bangladesh shows that the consequences of cyclones can be significantly lessened through effective early warning systems and construction of cyclone shelters along the coast.\nCurrent development patterns, in particular in poorer countries, result in more and more people and assets being concentrated in hazard-prone areas such as flood plains, unstable slopes, coastal cities and river deltas.\nRisk reduction must become a major priority in poverty reduction strategies. Most important are activities at the community level, such as urban planning, safer construction, environmental management, early warning systems and training of local populations.\nMaxx Dilley, co-author of the Earth Institute's 2005 report \"Natural Disasters Hotspots,\" wrote: \"With natural hazard cycles repeating themselves every few years, developing countries find themselves in a vicious cycle of loss and recovery, without the ability to move forward. We recommend that the international community manage disaster risk as an integral part of development planning rather than only as a humanitarian issue.\"\nWhat are we waiting for?\n",

    "text": "The Lethal Water Wells of Bangladesh\n2005-07-17T05:00:00.000Z\nCHAPAI NAWABGANJ, Bangladesh - The gaggle of children seemed puzzled by the question. Joly Khatun, a playful 8-year-old girl, said of course she drank water from her neighborhood pump. Muhammad Morsalin, a mischievous 10-year-old boy, said he did, too.\n\"No one told me not to,\" he said.\nThe two children are victims of what the World Health Organization has declared the \"largest mass poisoning of a population in history.\" Their hand-operated water pump in this town in northwestern Bangladesh produces water laced with arsenic. The poison gradually debilitates its victims before spawning cancers that kill them.\nAs many as 20 million Bangladeshis drink water contaminated with arsenic, according to American and Bangladeshi researchers; estimates vary widely, but some experts believe arsenic poisoning, if left unchecked, could ultimately cause cancers that could kill millions. . Dr. Allan H. Smith, director of the arsenic research program at the University of California, Berkeley, called the situation \"the highest environmental cancer risk ever found,\" a threat worse than Chernobyl or Bhopal.\nA decade after Bangladeshi officials confirmed the widespread arsenic contamination, some signs of progress are emerging, according to Bangladeshi officials and American experts. But even as initial steps are taken to counter arsenic poisoning, new complications arise.\nIn a step forward, a $30 million project financed by the World Bank and the Swedish government has tested 5 million of the country's 11 million tube wells and found 1.4 million, or roughly 29 percent, to be contaminated, according to Bangladeshi officials. Alternative water supplies are being constructed in 10,000 of the worst affected areas, they said. And after initially refusing to admit the problem, the Bangladeshi government has adopted a national arsenic mitigation strategy.\nBut the international and national response remains far too slow, according to Bangladeshi arsenic victims and American experts. They contend that comparatively meager efforts are being made. \"There are simple things to do,\" said Richard Wilson, a Harvard University physicist and arsenic poisoning expert. \"But they're not being done.\"\nBangladeshi government and World Bank officials say they are doing their best to counter a staggering problem. Testing and possibly replacing millions of tube wells in Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries, is a gargantuan task.\nThey also point out that more immediate killers, like bacterial contamination of drinking water, compete for the same resources and attention. Khwaja M. Minnatullah, a senior water and sanitation specialist for the World Bank, said bacteria in drinking water continued to kill about 110,000 children a year in Bangladesh.\n\"This is still the major killer related to drinking water contamination in Bangladesh and across the developing world,\" Mr. Minnatullah said. \"There should be a balanced response to address the whole issue of contamination of drinking water.\"\nChapai Nawabganj illustrates the new complications that have emerged.\nA year after inspectors declared the water at the pump in the impoverished neighborhood of Rajarampur Master Para contaminated, some families use it only to wash clothes and floors, according to residents. But other families, and many neighborhood children, continue to drink from the pump.\nMuhammad Yad Ali, 42, a neighborhood yarn trader, said inspectors painted the water pump's spout red as a warning. But over time, the paint has washed away, and fears of poisoning have faded. Hot and thirsty after playing games, children drink the water in great gulps.\n\"When they first put the red color, everyone became afraid,\" Mr. Ali said. \"Now, they became more relaxed and don't think about the drinking.\"\nA new system of piped water is being built, he added. But the slow-moving project has yet to reach Rajarampur Master Para.\nA second neighborhood, Swarupnagar, illustrated another problem. Munir ul Haq, 26, a motor-parts shop owner, said one team tested his neighborhood tube well and declared the water safe to drink. A year later, a second team tested it, declared the water unsafe and painted the spout red. He said residents had stopped drinking the water but were unsure what to believe.\nA half mile away, Sumon Ali, a 20-year-old mechanic, said inspectors declared water from the tube well behind his auto repair shop contaminated two years ago. Ten months ago, he dug a new well a few feet away to create more space for his garage. No one knows if the new tube well is also contaminated.\nThe arsenic problem in Bangladesh was born of good intentions. For 20 years, government and United Nations officials, as well as Bangladeshi aid groups, urged Bangladeshis to stop drinking unclean pond water, to prevent the lethal diseases it bred. Instead, they were to invest in tube wells to tap into underground aquifers. Unfortunately, no one tested the aquifers for arsenic.\nSalma Begum, 30 and the mother of three, lives in the village of Abirpara in central Bangladesh. She is one of 38,118 arsenic patients identified by the World Bank study. (Some experts contend that the number is far higher.)\nMs. Begum said her poisoning stemmed from years of drinking from an arsenic-laced well in her home village. She began drinking clean water five years ago, but her health continues to worsen.\nArsenic kills quickly in high doses, but is a slow and unpredictable attacker in small amounts. It takes 2 to 20 years to unleash its damage, affecting different people in different ways. Some people, including all of Ms. Begum's relatives, drank arsenic-laced water for years and are unaffected.\nAll over Ms. Begum's tiny, slowly withering body, signs of arsenic poisoning have emerged. Ugly and painful boils cover her hands and feet. Her veins protrude from her skin. Dark spots cover her arms, legs and parts of her body she declines to show. Her skin itches endlessly when exposed to sunlight.\nShe said her largest problem was a creeping weakness and constant ache in her arms and wrists. Her arms have grown so feeble that she struggles to hold her 2-year-old son and care for her husband and two daughters. As she speaks, she constantly kneads the muscles in her forearms and wrists, as if trying to wring the pain from her flesh.\nMs. Begum said she could not afford to buy medicine to counter some of the symptoms. She is not alone. Bangladesh's government has adopted a protocol to treat people identified with arsenic poisoning, but the outreach group that aids her, Dhaka Community Hospital, says it does not have adequate financing to provide treatment.\nMs. Begum, meanwhile, grows weaker and more frustrated by the day. Teams conducting surveys for arsenic victims have interviewed her, she said, but the poison continues to slowly devour her body.\n\"Visitors come and write down our problems in the notebook,\" she said, as her children clutched at her legs. \"But no action is taken.\"",

    "text": "The Future of Calamity\n2005-01-02T05:00:00.000Z\nIN seven hours last week, great ocean waves scoured shores from Thailand to Somalia, exacting a terrible price in wealth and human lives. But unimaginable as it may seem, future catastrophes may be far grimmer. Many more such disasters -- from earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, to floods, mudslides and droughts -- are likely to devastate countries already hard hit by poverty and political turmoil.\nThe world has already seen a sharp increase in such \"natural\" disasters -- from about 100 per year in the early 1960's to as many as 500 per year by the early 2000's, said Daniel Sarewitz, a professor of science and society at Arizona State University. But it is not that earthquakes and tsunamis and other such calamities have become stronger or more frequent. What has changed is where people live and how they live there, say many experts who study the physics of such events or the human responses to their aftermath.\nAs new technology allows, or as poverty demands, rich and poor alike have pushed into soggy floodplains or drought-ridden deserts, built on impossibly steep slopes, and created vast, fragile cities along fault lines that tremble with alarming frequency.\nIn that sense, catastrophes are as much the result of human choices as they are of geology or hydrology. Dr. Kerry Sieh, a veteran seismologist at the California Institute of Technology, has spent years studying some of the world's wealthiest and poorest earthquake-prone territory -- not only the sickle-shaped scar of faults off Sumatra's west coast that caused last week's tsunami, but also California's San Andreas fault, which could, with a sudden twitch, submerge the inhabitants of some of the most valuable land on Earth.\nThe difference between the rich and poor countries, Dr. Sieh said, was that the rich ones had improved their building techniques and their political systems to deal with inevitable disasters.\nIn the Pacific Northwest, where offshore faults could generate a tsunami as large as last week's ocean-spanning waves, officials have created \"inundation maps\" to know more precisely what would happen in a flood and prepare accordingly. And in response to the threat of earthquakes, buildings on the West Coast now are designed to sway over shifting foundations, and new highway overpasses are no longer stacked like the jaws of a huge horizontal vise.\nIstanbul, Tehran, New Delhi and other increasingly dense and shabbily constructed cities, on the other hand, are rubble in waiting. When an earthquake leveled the ancient Iranian city of Bam in 2003, for instance, more than 26,000 people were essentially crushed by their own homes. Several earthquake experts refer to the \"seismic gap\" as a way of describing this difference between the ability of rich cities and poor ones to withstand earthquake damage.\n\"Tehran is a city the size of Los Angeles, with thrust faults like Los Angeles,\" Dr. Sieh said. \"In Los Angeles the next 7.5 quake might kill 50,000 people. In Tehran, that would kill more than a million people.\"\nNonetheless, elected officials and disaster agencies, both public and private, remain focused on responding to catastrophes instead of trying to make societies more resilient in the first place, said Dr. Brian E. Tucker, a geophysicist and the head of GeoHazards International, a private research group trying to reduce poor countries' vulnerability to earthquakes. For instance, while the United Nations in 1989 declared the 1990's the \"International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction,\" and created a secretariat to run it, it set no concrete goals or timetable for accomplishing them, Dr. Tucker said.\nHe described a recent study by Tearfund, a Christian relief agency, that found that less than 10 percent of the money spent on disaster relief by government agencies and institutions like the World Bank goes to preventive measures. According to the study, Mozambique, anticipating major flooding in 2002, asked for $2.7 million to make basic emergency preparations. It received only half that amount from international donor organizations. After the flood, those same organizations ended up committing $550 million in emergency assistance, rehabilitation and reconstruction financing.\nDr. Sieh said he was not confident that wealthy countries would ever recognize the value of prevention. Even as they grow more scientifically prescient, people have a blind spot for certain inevitable disasters, either because they play out over long time frames, like global warming, or because they are rare, like tsunamis.\n\"I really am wondering if, from an evolutionary biological perspective, we're really equipped to deal with things that only recur once every several lifetimes or longer,\" Dr. Sieh said.\nJeffrey Sachs, director of Columbia University's Earth Institute, was more optimistic, if only slightly so. He noted how Bangladesh had seen its mortality rates from flooding drop sharply since the 1970's, mainly by adopting simple means of getting people to higher ground, some as basic as installing high platforms for people to climb above the floodwaters.\nBUT he also noted another class of cataclysms that which receive no blanket news coverage: malaria, AIDS, crop failures -- even global warming.\n\"We're at a period in Earth's history where we're living on an edge where things can go terribly wrong if we're not attentive,\" Dr. Sachs said. \"But we also have magnificent knowledge and technologies that could make the outcomes far better than they are now.\"\nThe tsunami assault, he said, could be a call to action. But he and Dr. Sieh agreed that it could also end up just another in a series of distant disasters, a disturbing distraction for the world's more fortunate nations.\n\"There is a technological and scientific basis for proactive strategies,\" Dr. Sachs said. \"But they are not being applied, and there is no reason for that. It's not even a question of money. It's much cheaper to anticipate rather than respond.\" That is true, he said, whether the goal is restoring fertility to African soil or building a system to warn of tsunamis.",

    "text": "'Extreme Weather': You Do Need a Weatherman\n2005-01-30T05:00:00.000Z\nEXTREME WEATHER A Guide & Record Book. By Christopher C. Burt. Cartography by Mark Stroud. Illustrated. 304 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. Paper, $24.95.\nTHE sky is falling, temperatures are more extreme, tornadoes ravage the land, Buffalo is probably buried in snow at this very moment, and it is flooding somewhere in the world. Hailstones the size of pumpkins -- yes, pumpkins -- may be pummeling Bangladesh right now. Your town's temperature may hit a record high today. Or maybe a record low. Or your temperatures may reach a record high and a record low in a single 24-hour period. It happens: not necessarily at the same time all over the world -- that's a disaster movie scenario -- but pretty much every year there is a spate of appallingly anomalous weather somewhere, convincing most of us that the weather is changing, and for the worse.\nIn 2004, Florida was pounded with a record four hurricanes in a single season, a disaster that cost 117 lives and destroyed 25,000 homes. In early January, five days of torrential rains in California triggered mudslides that killed at least 10 people. The same storm brought blizzard conditions to North Dakota, where the wind chill dropped to 50 below. And while it was more a geological event than a climatological one, a magnitude-9 earthquake off the north coast of Sumatra generated a tsunami that has, to date, killed some 150,000 people.\nChristopher C. Burt, the author of the excellent and addictive \"Extreme Weather: A Guide & Record Book,\" strives to put all this in context. He reminds us that, eons ago, the earth experienced some mind-boggling temperatures: there were glaciers in Wisconsin, and palm trees littered northern Canada. That's climate, of course, not weather. Weather happens in the short term, and we humans haven't been keeping reliable records all that long. \"In the United States,\" Burt writes, \"weather records have been maintained by the official weather services since about 1870. In the 50 preceding years, records were kept intermittently by individuals and by some institutions, including the Smithsonian Institution.\" The figures we have \"represent only a fraction of human experience with weather,\" but may be used as a \"yardstick\" to determine climatic trends. By this yardstick, the weather is not becoming more extreme.\nBurt, who was born in Manhattan in October 1954, during New York's most severe hurricane on record, was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the weather historian David M. Ludlum and studied meteorology at the University of Wisconsin. The man is obsessed with violent weather in the pleasantly dotty, accuracy-infatuated manner of someone in the throes of elucidating a lifelong passion. And while extreme weather fascinates him, Burt himself seems to have no desire actually to experience it. He lives in Oakland, described as \"a city of unremitting weather dullness.\" (Earthquakes, apparently, have no dominion over his imagination.)\nBurt spends but a single page on global warming. \"There is little debate over the fact that over the past 25 years or so global temperatures have risen significantly, and the trend has escalated since 1990.\" Why? Well, he points out that many weather stations have been moved from cities to nearby airports, where acres of asphalt radiate more heat. Some weather stations, previously in the countryside, have been absorbed into urban areas, which are warmer in the winter. Still, deserts are expanding, glaciers are melting, and Burt is obliged to note that \"recent studies\" indicate that an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere \"is inextricably associated with global temperature change.\"\nHow hot can it get? The weather station near Furnace Creek, Calif., in Death Valley, located 282 feet below sea level, records an average daily high of 115 degrees and a low of 87 degrees during July, making it the hottest location in North America and \"perhaps the hottest place in the world.\" Oddly, I found myself rooting for Death Valley in the worldwide temperature sweepstakes. The valley hit 134 degrees on July 10, 1913. That's the warmest temperature ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere, and is exceeded only by a reading of 136 degrees recorded in Al Aziziyah, Libya, and a \"questionable\" reading of 135 degrees in Algeria.\nThe coldest reading in the United States was 79.8 degrees below zero at Prospect Creek, Alaska, on Jan. 23, 1971. Fort Yukon, Alaska, averaged 48.4 below zero during December 1917, the coldest American month on record. The coldest major city in the lower 48 is Minneapolis-St. Paul, where it hit 41 degrees below zero in January 1889. I am proud to point out that the lowest temperature ever reliably recorded in the lower 48 was in my home state of Montana, where it was 70 below at Rogers Pass on Jan. 20, 1954. I am also perversely proud of the fact that, on Jan. 14-15, 1972, the temperature in Loma, Mont., rose 103 degrees -- from 54 below to 49 above -- the greatest temperature change ever recorded anywhere during a 24-hour period.\nBurt's book is full of tables listing your state's highs and lows, its precipitation and snowfall records, but \"Extreme Weather\" also provides concise explanations for many of the odd and extreme phenomena he describes. For instance, I suspect many Americans may share my delight in the fact that our nation arguably experiences more severe thunderstorms than anywhere else on earth. Burt explains that this is a result of our unique geography: warm, unstable air from the subtropical waters of the Gulf of Mexico collides with cold, dry sub-Arctic air sweeping down from the north. Unlike Europe or Asia, America has no mountains running east to west to separate these antagonists. This country is made for lightning storms and torrential rains and heavy floods and hailstorms.\nIn fact, the largest American hailstone ever measured -- a veritable volleyball, seven inches across -- fell in Aurora, Neb., in June 2003. It's disappointing to learn this was not the largest authenticated hailstone in the world. That honor belongs to the Gopalganj district of Bangladesh, where, in 1986, a stone weighed in at 2.25 pounds. \"Its diameter,\" Burt says, \"was not reported, although anecdotal evidence points to stones the size of 'pumpkins.' \"\nTHERE are appendixes at the end of \"Extreme Weather,\" giving city and state snow, precipitation and temperature records. What's remarkable is that almost every place in America seems to hold a record for some bit of exceptional weather. You probably live in, or near, the wettest or the driest place, the windiest or most calm area, the coldest or the hottest place or the one most prone to tornadoes or hurricanes. Something happened where you live: something either fierce or strange or wondrous. For example, a dust storm over Illinois on April 11, 1902, lifted an immense quantity of dirt into the air. Winds pushed this dirt east, where it was sucked into storm clouds, and the next day it rained mud in New York.\nBurt's book explores killer floods, swirling dust storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, hail, snow and windstorms, as well as \"mud rains\" falling over New York. The weather in some places is extreme in its very lack of extremity. Honolulu is the major American city that exhibits the least extreme absolute range of temperature, which is 43 degrees (52 degrees to 95 degrees). I suspect the locals rarely feel as though the sky were falling. Perhaps there are some who, after spending another predictably perfect day in paradise, occasionally wish that it would.\nTim Cahill is the author of nine books, including \"Lost in My Own Backyard: A Walk in Yellowstone National Park.\" He lives near the Yellowstone Plateau, the fourth-coldest region in the United States.",

    "text": "A Modern Peril: Living Near the Jaws of the Sea\n2005-01-11T05:00:00.000Z\nUntil recently, few people lived by the sea. Life there was just too precarious.\nNowadays, about half the world's population lives within 10 miles of the coast, often in megacities like Shanghai or Rio de Janeiro, said Dr. Stephen P. Leatherman of the International Hurricane Center at Florida International University. They also live in sprawling, low-lying river delta settlements like those along the mouths of the Ganges in Bangladesh.\nIn rich countries, people live on the coast because they can. When erosion threatens their homes, they engineer elaborate walls or pump more sand onto their beaches. And when storms damage them, they rely on disaster relief or insurance payouts.\nIn poor countries, people live in harm's way because they must. They settle in river deltas because they have no other good farmland, or on the beach because they need to be near fishing or tourism jobs.\nIn the past, people found ways to use the ocean but avoid its dangers. Indians in New England built their summer camps near the ocean, for example, but not right on the beach. And by fall, when the winds started picking up, they would move inland.\nThe Europeans who followed them followed their building practices as well. When they settled Cape Cod, for example, they put most of their buildings along Cape Cod Bay, not on the rougher ocean side, which they dismissed as \"the back beach.\"\nOn the Outer Banks of North Carolina, the story was the same -- first the Indians and then the Europeans settled away from the ocean. When people finally started building houses near the dunes, in the 20th century, they designed them to be movable and put them on lots that ran far back from the sea -- 600 feet or more in some cases.\nSometimes the advantages of living right on the shore overwhelmed the disadvantages, but even then people adapted their lives to the rigors of the coast, as Dr. Orrin H. Pilkey Jr., a geologist at Duke University who has studied coastal development around the world, discovered on visits to barrier islands along the coast of Colombia.\nIslanders lived near the beach because \"there was more breeze there and it gave them a little advantage over the malaria mosquitoes,\" Dr. Pilkey said.\nBut the islands were earthquake-prone, suffering nine major quakes in the 20th century, said Dr. Pilkey, who described the area in his book \"A Celebration of the World's Barrier Islands\" (Columbia University Press, 2003). Almost always, the earthquakes that were generated caused the islands to subside, making them more and more vulnerable to high water and erosion. For a while, the islanders dealt with these problems by retreating from the beach.\n\"They built their houses to be portable,\" Dr. Pilkey said in an interview. \"The houses were made in panels, wood panels, and they would just take these panels off and in a matter of days they could move these houses.\"\nBut the subsidence left one island, which once flooded only two or three times a month, underwater at every high tide. Finally, an unusually high tide was enough to cut an inlet across the island, Dr. Pilkey said. The villagers moved onto the mainland.\nNow, populations are not so movable and the results are all too familiar. The Indian Ocean tsunami killed more than 150,000 people. A cyclone that struck Bangladesh in 1970 killed 300,000 to 500,000, and the uncertainty about the toll testifies to the precarious existence of the storm's victims. In part, the toll was so high because the delta's impoverished people had cut down its coastal mangrove forests for cooking fuel, destroying an ecosystem that might have offered them some protection. Nevertheless, when the storm ended, many survivors returned to this dangerous landscape. They had no choice.\nFor people like this, and for many of the survivors of last month's tsunami, abandoning the coast is not an option. Should they have better local tsunami warning systems? Of course. But in poor, low-lying areas without ready access to high ground, how much can warnings help?\n\"If you went to the nations that experienced this tsunami a year ago, they would have said, 'That's low on our priority list,\"' said Dennis S. Mileti, former director of the Natural Hazards Center at the University of Colorado and author of \"Disasters by Design\" (National Academies Press, 1999).\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, in Ewa Beach, Hawaii, which tracked last month's tsunami, was established after tidal waves generated by an earthquake in the Aleutian Islands struck Hilo, Hawaii, in 1946, wrecking the town's waterfront and killing 159 people there. In 1960, the region was struck by another tsunami. This one killed 61 people.\nThe people of Hilo did not abandon their town. \"They still have a port there,\" Dr. Leatherman said. But fewer people live along its waterfront. City officials realized that the town's funnel-shaped harbor amplified the tsunami effects -- and they turned the damaged area into a park.",

    "text": "Talks in Beijing to seek end to EU textile standoff\n2005-08-23T05:00:00.000Z\n\nBRUSSELS \u2014 The European Commission said Monday that it would send trade officials to Beijing this week to address a standoff that has left millions of Chinese-made garments piled up in European warehouses.\nBras, blouses and flax yarn are the latest categories of Chinese-made imports that will be restricted from entering the European Union after they exceeded 2005 quotas. European retailers have complained that the limitations will hurt business and mean less choice for consumers in the autumn and winter.\n\"Our main problem is the pullovers,\" said Paer Darj, head of investor relations at Hennes & Mauritz, the largest European clothing chain. The company has an unspecified number of garments blocked in the port of Hamburg after a deadline for gaining import licenses was brought forward, he said.\nThe Stockholm-based company H&M has shifted production to Bangladesh, India and Cambodia in response to the quotas, Darj said.\nThe EU trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson, on June 10 fixed limits on 10 categories of Chinese clothes and textiles to shield European manufacturers from a flood of cheaper imports.\nCompanies have secured licenses for the maximum 151 million shirts, 96.1 million bras and unspecified tonnage of flax yarn available for import from China this year. Pullovers, trousers and women's shirts had already filled allowances.\nTrade ministers from the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark have said that the measures, which followed the end of four decades of World Trade Organization restrictions on textile exporters like China, were rushed and are hurting retailers.\nBut countries with big national textile industries - including France, Italy and Spain - argue that they will suffer if Chinese clothing enters EU markets on a massive scale.\n\"It has been a big problem for us,\" said Lee Newsome, a product manager at Panache Lingerie, which imports a million underwear items into Britain a year. \"The quotas were introduced at very short notice.\"\nT-shirts are the next category likely to breach the quota limit, according to an EU imports database.\n\"Other quotas may fill this week but we'll have to see how the situation evolves,\" said a European Commission spokeswoman, Krisztina Nagy.\nTextile trade experts from the EU are due to discuss the Chinese import situation at a meeting this week, pitting the countries with influential retail industries against those with important textile industries.\nMandelson wants to negotiate with China to allow more imports, possibly by using some of the quotas for 2006 this year, and he is under pressure from several EU countries with strong clothing retail sectors to relax the restrictions.\nExports total $61.5 billion\nChinese textile and garment exports worldwide totaled $61.5 billion in the first seven months of this year, with growth accelerating in June and July from May, according to a posting on the Ministry of Commerce Web site on Monday, Bloomberg News reported.\nTextile and garment makers sold 28 percent more abroad in June from a year earlier. In July, growth was 23 percent, and in May expansion was 19 percent.\nThe companies are expected to secure a bigger share of the European market next year as the export environment improves with the implementation of an agreement signed in June governing 10 textile goods, the ministry said.\n",

    "text": "All News Is Local\n2005-01-02T05:00:00.000Z\nFOR every disaster and killer wave in the world, there are ripples in New York. So while it may be too soon to measure the economic and social impact of the South Asian tsunami on the city, it is not too soon to predict that the city will feel repercussions.\nA century ago, New York neighborhoods were defined by the traditional ethnic cocktail of Irish, Italians and Jews, and to some degree, those groups still define the city. But their dominance is receding as fast as the floods on beaches half a world away.\nAs the world's borders become increasingly porous, the city has absorbed people from points on the map that many New Yorkers probably couldn't find on the first try. These days, it's hard to imagine a major event on the planet that wouldn't resonate with some hyphenated community in New York. It's been some time since the city was defined by just a few major ethnic groups.\n\"Now it's a hundred,\" says Kenneth T. Jackson, editor of The Encyclopedia of New York City. \"Just look at Queens; it's probably the most diverse single place on earth. Every stop on the No. 7 train is a different country.\n\"I suspect Queens itself would probably reverberate with anything that happens anywhere,\" he added. \"There is not, I think, an immigrant group anywhere on earth that's not represented in New York. This was not true half a century ago.\"\nOr 20 years ago. The waves that pounded the shores of Sri Lanka were felt on Staten Island's north shore, home to much of the city's Sri Lankan population, which has grown from a mere 440 souls in 1980 to more than 2,900 in 2000. Small numbers, but still an increase of nearly 600 percent.\nThe waves were also felt among the 43,000 Bangladeshis concentrated in Astoria, Woodside and Elmhurst; the 68,300 Indians in places like Richmond Hill; the 4,000 Burmese in Elmhurst, Bensonhurst and Midwood; the 4,200 Thais in Astoria and Elmhurst; the 7,600 Malaysians centered in Flushing; and the 2,800 Indonesians found mainly across Queens.\nWho even knew, until last week, that there was a Sri Lankan neighborhood in New York? As Mike Wallace, director of the Gotham Center for New York City History, jokes, the trick is to look for the restaurant. Sure enough, New Asha Sri Lanka restaurant is on Victory Boulevard.\nAnother indicator of shifting ethnicities is the public school population. \"Sri Lankans?\" one Stuyvesant sophomore said without a moment's hesitation. \"I have two in my music class. They live on Staten Island.\"\nSome people would not be surprised to see South Asian enrollment rise in the public schools after this disaster. \"When Hurricane Hugo struck in the Caribbean, we had thousands of schoolchildren arriving in the middle of October,\" said Mitchell Moss, professor of urban planning and policy at New York University. \"The fall of governments, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes all lead to new people coming into New York because this is where they have families, this is where they have communities, and because New York is a welcoming place.\"\nOver the years, disasters have shaped and reshaped the city. One could start, Mr. Wallace says, with the 1790's and the Haitian revolution, then move on to the 1840's and the Irish potato famine.\nThe list is as long as history, he adds: \"There were German political and economic crises slow-rolling in the 1840's. The Russian Revolution sends White Russians here in droves in the 20's. We get Chinese restaurants after the Chinese revolution. We have German-Jewish refugees trying to pile in, in one of the greatest transfers of intellectual firepower since, people would argue, the fall of Constantinople. The U.S. invades the Dominican Republic in '65 and, boom, you have Washington Heights. The Vietnam War sets people in motion toward Chinatown.\"\nAnd the trend is accelerating. More than 40 percent of the city's foreign-born population arrived after 1990, and diversification has been abetted by federal immigration policy, which has shifted from granting visas mainly for family unification to awarding them by lottery.\nJoseph Salvo, population director for the City Planning Department, is willing to describe New York as the nation's most diverse city, though he's cautious about saying it's the world's most diverse. Toronto, S\u00e3o Paulo, Sydney, Rome, Tokyo are rivals.\nIf the city doesn't see a surge of South Asians, historians say, it may be because manmade disasters tend to drive immigration more directly than natural disasters. War and genocide close off hope for the future. Tsunamis end as quickly as they begin, and people try to rebuild. But no one should be surprised if somewhere in Queens or Staten Island, a memorial to last week's disaster is erected, a reminder of one more connection to a distant corner of the world.\nCOPING E-mail: amh@nytimes.com",

At least 60 injured workers were pulled from the debris and taken to hospitals, he said.\nMohammad Alamgir, a survivor trapped beneath the slabs of concrete, briefly spoke with relatives using a mobile phone before losing contact.\n\"He said he was dying and he asked for some water,\" said Nurul Islam, apolice official supervising the rescue work. \"We are trying to locate him.\"\nRescuers used welding machines to cut holes in the rubble to try to reach trapped people or pump air to survivors. They said narrow roads leading to the collapse site had restricted access for cranes and other rescue equipment.\nAnxious relatives joined soldiers and fire fighters who used bare hands and crow bars to sift through the rubble.\n\"My brother was working in the factory. He is missing,\" said Munni Akthar, who works in another garment factory.\n\"I was overseeing the workers when there was a big bang and (the) building suddenly started shaking and going down,\" said a survivor Helaluddin, who uses one name.\nHelaluddin said he was on the 7th floor along with about 90 workers when the building collapsed.\n\"I was buried under slabs of concrete before I could realize what had happened,\" he said before being taken to a hospital.\nThere were fewer women in the factory than earlier thought because male workers are preferred for late night shift, said another survivor Haider Ali. Initially officials said most of the victims were women.\nThe government has ordered an investigation into the accident, said Lutfozzaman Babar, junior home minister, after visiting the site.\nThe collapsed factory was built on a swamp three years ago, workers said.Bangladesh has about 2,500 garment factories employing about 1.8 million workers \u2014 about 90 percent of them women.\nThe South Asian nation exports more than $5 billion in textiles each year.\n",

    "text": "The Workplace: Chinese learn value of perks\n2005-05-11T05:00:00.000Z\n\nSHUN DE, China \u2014 The entrance to the Carsan textile factory here looks like a California art gallery, with oil paintings hanging in a cavernous, light-filled lobby furnished with Japanese-style tables and tropical plants.\nLocated in an industrial part of China that is more grime than glamour, the Carsan factory stands out. Workers live in a dormitory that from the outside resembles a Singapore condominium. Each room has a balcony; the canteen has a corner where movies are projected onto a wall in the evenings and a library where workers can browse books and magazines.\nThere is a basketball court, badminton net and well-maintained shrubs and lawn.\nThe corollary to all this is a retention rate that would make some factory owners in the area green with envy: After the Chinese New Year holiday in February, when workers often change jobs, 97 percent of the 1,200 workers returned to Carsan, according to Loretta Lee, the owner.\n\"It wasn't a business calculation to say that we have to have a better facility because we have to keep our people,\" Lee said in a recent interview. \"We did it because we believe in humanity.\n\"At the same time, if you treat them better, they will stay with your factory.\"\nMake no mistake: the Carsan garment factory is not summer camp. The work is hard and tedious. Employees spend 8 to 10 hours hunched over sewing machines or patching together toys with glue guns. Workers live in spotless but spartan dormitory rooms, each with eight bunk beds.\nBut the factory has a very different feel from others in the industrialized Pearl River Delta, which is across from Hong Kong and is filled with buildings that could be mistaken for prisons.\nWith a labor shortage of two million people in southern China, workers these days can be more picky about where they work - and under what conditions. If this situation persists, factories will be forced to emulate Carsan as workers shun sweatshops and seek out perks.\nA few factories have already reportedly installed swimming pools and gymnasiums. Others have increased bonuses.\nWorkers at Carsan are typically paid anywhere from 800 to 1,500 yuan a month, about $95 to $180, well above the minimum wage of 547 yuan, according to John Lee, a manager at the factory who is not related to Loretta.\nThe driving philosophy behind the perks at the factory, according to Loretta Lee, is that productivity will rise with retention rates.\nTo the outside world, China is seen these days, especially in Europe and the United States, as a place that floods the world with cheap textiles, especially after the sharp increases in exports this year caused by the abolition of quota restrictions.\nBut at the same time, factory owners here have been battling shrinking margins and heightened competition from new factories in China.\n\"My thinking is that the only way we can make it work is efficiency,\" Loretta Lee said.\n\"We know that wages will eventually go higher and higher,\" she said. \"From Japan the factories moved to Korea; from Korea they moved to Taiwan and then to China.\"\nCountries like Bangladesh or India could be next.\nFor now the work on the factory floor here is still labor-intensive. The factory specializes in American holiday decorations.These days, it is Halloween and Thanksgiving season.\nOne woman spends her days gluing straw hairpieces onto a witch doll. Other workers stuff and weigh hundreds of orange and black pillows decorated with ghosts.\nZhong Peng Yun, a 27-year-old native of Jiangxi Province, sits on a stool stitching large pieces of cloth together all day.\nHe sometimes works until 10 p.m. because he is paid by the piece and wants to save money for his family.\nHe says he is happy with his salary and the working conditions but misses his wife and 1-year-old son, who live five hours away by bus.\nA conversation with Zhong reveals that even having a decent job in southern China does not ease the separation from families.\n\"I call my wife at least three or four times a week,\" he said. \"I'm homesick.\"\nThomas Fuller can be reached at fuller@iht.com.\n",

    "text": "Furor Over China Imports Makes Future Supply Uncertain\n2005-04-21T05:00:00.000Z\nNew York's garment district is in turmoil.\nThe long-awaited end of country-by-country quotas on apparel imports was supposed to usher in an era of more efficient global operations, allowing companies like Jones Apparel, Liz Claiborne and Calvin Klein to arrange for their clothes to be sewn wherever it made the most sense.\nBut the garment industry's pumping up of production in China set off a reaction around the world that could lead Beijing to curb exports significantly in hopes of preventing even harsher limits from being imposed by the United States and Europe. That is making it unexpectedly difficult for the fashion industry to predict its costs and to maintain a reliable supply network.\n\"Right now, it's a complete free-for-all,\" said Bruce Rockowitz, president of Li & Fung Trading, one of the world's biggest agents for Asian clothing manufacturing. Sitting in his office in Manhattan's garment district, Mr. Rockowitz said the current uncertainty \"is destabilizing factories in China and garment makers in the United States.\"\nThe level of uncertainty just keeps rising. This week, some American clothing executives said they had heard conflicting reports about China's readiness to impose substantial new tariffs, perhaps as early as May.\nTo a certain extent, the confusion is the garment industry's own fault. Before the end of 2004, most clothing companies placed rush orders in China for billions of dollars of goods, which flooded into the United States after the global quotas were lifted on Jan. 1.\nThe large apparel companies have been moving toward suppliers outside the United States for decades, fitting China into a complex system of manufacturers in places like the Caribbean and Latin America, Asia and Africa, all because of the global rules.\nBut now, for the first time, American companies can freely trade in articles like cotton pants and tops without the expensive and time-consuming need to balance orders among dozens of countries.\nSince the beginning of the year, wholesale prices of those tops and pants have fallen 20 percent to 40 percent. And the volume has been unprecedented: in one month -- January -- the Chinese shipped as much of certain categories as they shipped in all of 2004.\nAmerica's remaining textile producers and clothing manufacturers protested that the surge of cheap imports needed to be contained and demanded that Washington step in to soften the blow.\nIn hopes of defusing the tensions, China imposed its own minor export tariffs, which took effect earlier this year. But most clothing executives worry that more restrictions are coming.\n\"There is a lot of noise right now that China is getting ready to increase tariffs substantially,\" said Robert J. Zane, who directs manufacturing and distribution worldwide for Liz Claiborne. \"I have spoken to two highly placed Chinese officials: one says they will and one says they won't. Clearly, they haven't made up their minds.\"\n\"Will there be new quotas?\" Mr. Zane continued. \"Probably. Will there be antidumping legislation, passed by the U.S.? Maybe.\"\nWith billions of dollars of merchandise at stake, many nervous Seventh Avenue executives are scrambling to devise strategies to hedge their bets on China.\nMany have tried to rush through as many orders as they can before new tariffs are levied or Congress presses the Bush administration to throw some sand into the Chinese export machine.\nBut Liz Claiborne, among others, has already started cutting back on some China orders.\n\"If you believe -- as we do -- that there will be new quotas imposed sometime from mid-June to mid-September of this year,\" Mr. Zane said, \"then it's highly likely that those quotas will be oversubscribed before the end of the year.\"\nFor orders of certain articles that are scheduled to arrive in stores this fall and winter, he said, the word has gone out: \"Don't place them in China.\"\nLi & Fung arranges the manufacture of $6.1 billion worth of clothes and other goods a year, for giant store chains like Kohl's, American Eagle Outfitters and Restoration Hardware.\n\"Generally, we're being very cautious about China,\" Mr. Rockowitz said.\nFashion companies have varied strategies. Many are still spreading their orders among low-wage apparel-making countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam and El Salvador.\n\"Right now, you don't want to put all of your eggs in one basket,\" said Homi Patel, the chief executive of Hartmarx, a $586 million clothing company that specializes in tailored suits.\nThe decades-old quota system was complex, with allocations for specific products in specific countries often bought and sold like futures contracts.\n\"But once you figured it out, you were golden,\" Mr. Zane said. By contrast, the new uncertainty over the free market in apparel is \"a nightmare,\" he said, \"because we're afraid everything will change.\"\nAmerican retailers and producers have gained, on the whole, under the system this year, managing to wring out savings at the wholesale level without necessarily cutting prices to consumers. Seventh Avenue executives say the overall uncertainty makes cutting prices now too risky: they say they will wait until they know whether the Chinese government will impose higher tariffs on exports.\nAndrew Grossman, chief executive of GAV, a company in Manhattan that designs and manufactures for Calvin Klein and Emanuel Ungaro, points out that not all the clothing made in China has turned out to be less expensive with the quotas lifted.\n\"It is the cheapest goods that have dropped the most,\" he said. The wholesale cost of cotton pants, for instance, has fallen 21 percent since the first of the year, while more expensive silks and embroidered goods have not changed.\nOn average, wholesale prices have fallen 7 percent to 10 percent, Mr. Grossman said, but \"the fear is this is a one-time benefit.\"\nThe Chinese government may decide that it does not want to be seen primarily as a source of cheap clothing, and thus may force factories to raise prices and aim at a higher segment of the market, Mr. Grossman said. This would ensure that big companies like Wal-Mart and others would maintain a strong presence in places like Bangladesh and Cambodia.\nMr. Rockowitz of Li & Fung said he thought that whatever Beijing did, the United States would impose safeguards to reduce the flood of garments coming from China for the next three to five years.\nOnce completely unregulated, he predicted, China could end up making clothes for 70 percent to 80 percent of the world's stores.\nSome official estimates place the figure at closer to 40 percent to 50 percent.\nIn 1983, when quotas on Chinese shoes were lifted, China made less than 4 percent of the world's shoes. By 2003, its factories had captured more than 80 percent of that business, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association.\nWhy should apparel be any different? Liz Claiborne's Mr. Zane asked.\nAs long as the uncertainty lasts, Liz Claiborne, like many others, plans to keep manufacturing its clothes widely around the globe, as it did under the old quota system.\n\"We don't go to 37 countries because we like to travel or because we collect stamps,\" Mr. Zane said. \"We go to 37 countries because that's how many countries we had to go to.\"\nSince the first of the year, Claiborne has cut the number of countries by five, but when the uncertainty over quotas is finally resolved, Mr. Zane predicts, his company will be in only 15 to 20.\nAt Liz Claiborne, people involved in finding places to produce fabric and sew clothes spent an estimated 40 percent of their time dealing with quota machinations, Mr. Zane said. All this will eventually go away.\nThen, some other garment makers have predicted, the cost of clothing in the department stores should fall an average of 15 percent.\nAnd what will happen to manufacturing in other countries, like Pakistan, Mexico and Guatemala, that had come to rely on the quota system?\nThe strong factories -- with flexibility, speed, quality and service -- should survive, Mr. Zane said. The weaker factories will fail.\n\"The beautiful thing,\" said Mr. Zane, who is 66, \"is that by the time they get it all figured out, I'll be retired.\"\nArticles in this series are periodically examining changes in the global clothing business.

    "text": "A Middleman Who Doesn't Feel Squeezed by China\n2005-09-15T05:00:00.000Z\nWITH Chinese clothing flooding the United States, Henry Fan foresees a huge shakeout in the Los Angeles garment industry, the nation's largest. \"Companies will go to the wall,\" he said.\nBut not his, he says. Mr. Fan is confident that Basic Elements Inc., the apparel-importing firm that he leads, will survive the flood of apparel from China that is causing American retailers to demand discounted prices from importers, the \"middlemen\" of the worldwide garment trade. His company can thrive, Mr. Fan believes, and not by going upscale, the strategy that many firms are pursuing as their hope for salvation.\nRather, he expects growth from acquiring distressed apparel firms and gaining the size and strength to withstand the risks of supplying big retail companies even at the low prices that Chinese imports are dictating.\n\"Risks are substantial in working with large volumes of products that mass merchants require,\" Mr. Fan said. \"If something goes wrong, you have to air-freight rather than ship to meet the schedule. The margin for error is thin.\"\nBut Mr. Fan says he believes he can continue to compete by using the expertise he gained in the worlds of technology and finance to build an international supply network to handle the growing trade.\n\"We have overseas offices in Hong Kong and in many parts of China as well as Bangladesh and Thailand,\" he said. \"We can design products here or overseas and ship them anywhere; we can tackle the job in numerous ways.\" In short, he wants to make Basic Elements a central part of the new supply equation of Chinese factories and American retailers.\nThat is a tall order. Employment in the Los Angeles area garment industry, which is made up of thousands of small firms, has fallen to 118,000 today from 142,000 in 1997. And if anything, the outlook seems even more dire.\nWith the elimination of most quotas this year, Chinese imports swelled into a torrent, increasing by more than 1,300 percent in some categories. With such an abundance of cheap clothing to choose from, American retailers have stepped up pressure on their supplier firms to cut prices on the goods they design, import and distribute.\nThe resulting cutthroat competition is expected to knock out hundreds of firms over the next few years, but Mr. Fan says Basic Elements is in a good position to come out of the storm even stronger. His optimism springs in part from the expertise and international connections that the company has accumulated in its 27-year history.\nBasic Elements was founded in 1978 by Paul Hui, an immigrant from Hong Kong, back when it was exceedingly difficult for American companies to do business in China. They needed permits from the Chinese government and knowledge of China's factories.\nMr. Hui supplied the knowledge and contacts and was able to build his company to $50 million in annual sales, with headquarters in the Los Angeles suburb of Irwindale and offices in Hong Kong and Bangladesh.\nToday, Basic Elements imports about 30 million garments a year, including children's clothing for the Toys 'R' Us chain and women's apparel for Chico's stores. Mr. Hui died of cancer this year, after passing on the chief executive title to Mr. Fan, a 33-year-old Taiwan-born professional manager with a background in finance and technology.\nMr. Fan faces a decidedly different global environment than Mr. Hui did more than a quarter-century ago. More large American retailers want to deal directly with Chinese factories. And Chinese factory executives and entrepreneurs are investing in Southern California companies. They do that, said Dominic Ng, chairman of East West Bank, a leading lender to the Chinese community, \"to qualify for visas to come to America\" as well as to gain a larger foothold in the American marketplace.\nAs Mr. Fan sees it, \"It's a classic case of squeezing the middleman, from above and below.\" He sees a bigger distribution pipeline as a way to squeeze back, but that is not the conventional strategy that many Los Angeles companies favor.\n\"Our industry must focus on fashion, as Italy has done for 500 years,\" said Ilse Metchek, executive director of the California Fashion Association, a trade group with more than 250 member companies. \"The model for Los Angeles must be unique design and quality to warrant higher prices and protect profit margins.\"\nShe recommends a boutique approach. A recent contemporary fashion show in the Los Angeles garment district, with wares like blue jeans that have a wholesale price of $150 and sell in stores for $300, featured company owners who were giving up the struggle to supply general department stores. For example, Orly Dahan, president of Tag Rag Inc., a maker of trendy denim clothing, saw his profits disappear as major retailers pushed him to discount his prices drastically. \"So I stopped,\" Mr. Dahan said, \"and now I concentrate on fashion and supply specialty stores.\"\nTo be sure, it takes ingenuity to compete in a time of falling worldwide prices, when \"a manufacturer in China can land a pair of jeans in the United States for $8.50 and make a profit,\" said George Rudes, an apparel industry veteran of five decades. Mr. Rudes's latest company, SLL Inc., features a design for a girdle-like Tummy Tuck Jean designed by his daughter, Lisa Rudes-Sandel.\n\"You must innovate, as we did,\" said Mr. Rudes, who has the specialized jeans manufactured in the United States and sells them wholesale for $44, with a recommended retail price below $100.\nMr. Fan of Basic Elements is all for innovation. He has hired a designer of children's clothing to offer fresh patterns to Toys 'R' Us. But he says his company must also play in the world market by fielding an efficient supply operation from overseas factories through the intricacies of transportation and customs and homeland security regulations to reliably deliver to retailers.\nMr. Fan is not an old-time apparel man. He studied accounting at the University of California, Berkeley and then worked in Silicon Valley's dot-com surge of the 1990's, including as a founder of an Internet software company that failed. One model he looks to for Basic Elements is Dell because of its skill at assembling computers from many locations and distributing them efficiently.\nAmong the companies he is in negotiations to acquire is one with licenses from the major sports leagues to make garments with team logos. \"Their margins have declined because their manufacturing costs are high,\" he said. Basic Elements can improve that, he says, by using factories it knows in China and shipping through its supply chain. Mr. Fan says he has also just received an offer to buy a factory in China.\nHis vision for Basic Elements is to build an organization that is able to distribute many different products. Another model he sees for his company is Li & Fung (Trading) Ltd., a 100-year-old Hong Kong firm that pioneered the idea of distributing garments from many manufacturers to numerous retail companies. Li & Fung today has annual revenue of $5.5 billion from sending apparel, furnishings and accessories to 40 countries.\nAccordingly, Mr. Fan says he can double Basic Elements' annual sales to $100 million and beyond by using debt and private equity investments to make acquisitions. \"Henry can do it because he has the accounting background and understands how to do mergers and acquisitions, where most small firms do not,\" said Mr. Ng of East West, the bankerto Basic Elements and many other Asian apparel firms.\nWith operations in China as well as Southern California -- and part ownership by major Wall Street investment firms -- East West \"can introduce Henry to sources of equity investment capital,\" Mr. Ng said.\nSay this for Mr. Fan, he is thinking big in a global market where China will be a permanent factor. China's apparel exports to the United States surged to $12 billion in the first half of 2005, from $8 billion in all of 2004, and now account for almost 20 percent of all apparel imports. In an immense and growing world market, Henry Fan is dealing with reality.\nENTREPRENEURIAL EDGE This column about small-business trends in California and the West appears on the third Thursday of every month.

    "text": "Read the Tea Leaves: China Will Be Top Exporter\n2005-10-11T05:00:00.000Z\nJINHUA, China - All the tea in China is proving to be a lot of tea these days, as hillsides across central and southern China are bulldozed to make way for tea farms even as many young Chinese are losing interest in the beverage.\nChina still has millions of tea lovers who lavish the same attention on their beverage that oenophiles devote to wine. The finest grades of green tea, made from the most delicate baby leaves and roasted in a pan by hand, sell for hundreds of dollars a pound in Shanghai and Beijing.\nBut Coca-Cola, Pepsi, McDonald's, KFC and other Western businesses have come up with many other ways to slake thirsts in China, especially that of young Chinese. Shifting tides in tastes are creating waves over winners and losers both at home and abroad. Teahouses in China already are being replaced by coffeehouses, and Starbucks, with more than 140 stores, has spawned a cottage industry of copycats.\nWith tea in abundance in China, more and more is being shipped abroad, by third-generation tea farmers like Pan Jintu, who wants to supply green tea to Starbucks stores in the United States.\n\"Many people love tea now, so I foresee our business will grow,\" he said, standing amid his rows of tea bushes, as women in broad hats plucked tea leaves in the surrounding hillsides here.\nBut expanding sales by Chinese tea growers like Mr. Pan are causing alarm in other developing countries that depend on growing tea, like India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Kenya, Malawi and Zimbabwe.\nWhile the growth of China's textile industry with the end of global textile quotas has attracted more attention as a threat to poor countries, China's tea industry also poses a challenge to some of the world's poorest nations. China is now poised to become the world's largest tea exporter by tonnage, overtaking Sri Lanka this year and Kenya next year.\nWide swaths of people across Asia depend on the tea industry for survival. Particularly vulnerable are countries that suffered from the tsunami last December: Indonesia, India and above all Sri Lanka, where income from the growing, processing and transport of tea helps feed nearly a tenth of the people, according to the Asian Development Bank.\nYet China's re-emergence as the world's leading tea exporter invokes a centuries-old pattern: the British East India Company, which bought its tea from China, held a monopoly on supplying Britain until 1834. Only when that monopoly was broken did other countries become big exporters. The saying \"I wouldn't do that for all the tea in China\" came to mean a refusal to do something even for a large and valuable payment.\nThe history of tea itself reaches back to ancient times in China. The earliest known literary references date back nearly 5,000 years, when Emperor Shen Nung is said to have discovered the infusion when leaves dropped into his hot water by chance.\nGreen tea is widely believed to have some medical benefits. Black tea, which may have similar benefits, is used in everything from Darjeeling to Earl Grey and is made from the leaves of the same tea plants as green tea, though processed differently.\nBut after millennia of popularity, tea consumption in China is growing by only 2 percent a year, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. By contrast, Chinese figures show tea production rising 8.7 percent last year and rapidly accelerating as recently planted tea bushes reach maturity and as inefficiently managed, state-owned farms are turned over to output-conscious entrepreneurs.\nFor the last three years, Beijing has set as its top goal the alleviation of rural poverty and high income inequality between coastal cities and rural areas, to the benefit of the tea industry. Municipal and provincial governments now vie to offer subsidies to an industry seen as an answer to lingering poverty and unemployment in the countryside, and are paying up to half the cost for the planting of new tea farms and the building of tea-processing factories.\nBeijing has also eliminated an 8 percent tax on tea production as a way to increase rural incomes. Tea promotion policies, which also include heavy spending on research institutes to develop better strains of tea as well as subsidies, do seem to bring greater prosperity to tea-growing areas.\nA 100-mile drive on the modern, four-lane highway from here to Hangzhou, at the northern end of east-central Zhejiang Province, passes dozens of villages bulging with new, three-story homes built of brick or concrete and featuring the garish green or blue tinted windows now in fashion here. Every few miles stands a new brick factory with a towering chimney belching smoke.\nJin Yuemei, a 54-year-old peasant near Hangzhou, paused before dousing nearly waist-high tea plants with an anticaterpillar pesticide and described how her home now held a television set, a refrigerator and even a couple of air-conditioners. \"Everyone has these things,\" she said. \"We are quite rich now.\"\nGovernment support helped produce an 18.9 percent jump in Chinese tea exports last year, to $437 million, in a global market that is nearly stagnant, according to official Chinese figures released at a conference in Hangzhou on Sept. 28. Because of the sudden sensitivity, Chinese officials have become a bit reticent about their future levels of tea production, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization.\nChina's surge in tea caught many off guard. Tea growers in India, Sri Lanka and Indonesia invested in new processing equipment to produce green tea instead of black tea only to discover recently that China has become their looming competitor.\nThey are only now beginning to see the giant steps, like investing in infrastructure, that China is making to improve its tea-making capability.\nSuch advanced infrastructure far outpaces tea growers in India, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Indonesia and other countries who make do with dirt roads and repeated power failures. The wide roads here lower costs to ship in diesel fuel to power the processing factories and ship out tea; electricity failures, a problem last year, have faded here as more generating plants are built.\n\"There's no way the containers could get to our farms,\" because the roads are too narrow and the bridges too low, said Ranga Bedi, a tea grower near Bangalore, India.\nTea production is a huge employer in countries around the Indian Ocean, including East African nations and Bangladesh as well as India, Sri Lanka and Indonesia. But already, four dozen large farms producing black tea have shut down in the last two years, displacing tens of thousands of workers in southern India. Tea is one of the world's most labor-intensive crops, with leaves that need to be harvested weekly for 7 to 12 months of the year.\nAlthough no one can yet read the tea leaves, several challenges could temper China's tea business.\nWith so many hillside forests cleared to make way for tea bushes, erosion has become a problem. \"The central government will restrain them some, because if people keep developing tea gardens as they wish, a lot of trees will be cut down,\" said Dai Changhua, the deputy general manager of Bonna Tea Enterprise near here in Jiashan County.\nProsperity here is pushing up wages, so farms already are drawing migrants from other provinces, and have sometimes used prison labor over the years. The winters, though milder than in northern China, mean that tea bushes in central China stop producing new leaves for harvest from mid-October to mid-March. In contrast, tea bushes in warmer climes, like southern India and western Java in Indonesia, can be harvested all year long.\nFinally, even a small appreciation in China's currency \"will really affect our business,\" said Xu Hairong, the deputy director of the Tea Research Institute at Zhejiang University here.\nFor the global industry, the bigger worry is how much Chinese tea will be arriving in world markets. That flood of tea will grow only if people in China keep switching to other beverages. Starbucks sells tea, as well as coffee, in China, but it has found that Chinese customers prefer the coffee, said Christine Day, the company's president for Asia and the Pacific.\nAt a popular tea house in Hangzhou, a married couple of traditional Chinese medical practitioners savored a pot on a recent late afternoon but mourned that their 25-year-old son did not share their interest in the ancient brew.\n\"He doesn't like tea,\" said the husband, who only gave his family name, Ren, because of a wariness of foreigners that is common among older Chinese. \"He doesn't like coffee, he mostly drinks Sprite, Coca-Cola and water.\"",

    "text": "West's dilemma over China textiles\n2005-04-04T05:00:00.000Z\n\nSHANGHAI \u2014 Imports of Chinese textile and apparel products into the United States soared in the first quarter of this year, offering new evidence that the world's clothing trade is being dramatically reshaped by the abolition of global quotas in January.\nThe U.S. Commerce Department said Friday that in the first three months of the year, preliminary data showed that imports of textile and apparel products from China rose more than 63 percent from a year earlier.\nIn some categories previously governed by the old system of country-by-country quotas, like underwear, cotton pants and cotton knit shirts, the increases were as much as 2,000 percent.\nThe figures came just days after Beijing released data showing that exports to the United States and Europe soared 50 percent in the first two months of the year from a year earlier, to nearly $5 billion.The data are certain to heighten trade tensions between China and the United States and Europe and also renew calls for American and European officials to place restrictions on some Chinese imports in order to protect Western manufacturing jobs.\nEuropean officials are discussing some form of trade restriction to stem the large flood of Chinese textile and apparel imports into the European Union, with a decision expected this week.\nThe Bush administration said last week that it was closely monitoring textile and apparel imports from China to better assess the impact on the U.S. textile and apparel industry. Trade relations between the two countries are already tense, partly because the American trade deficit with China reached a record $162 billion last year, making it the largest trade imbalance ever recorded by the United States with a single country.\nChinese officials are trying to play down the significance of recent trade data, saying it could be distorted because factories here ramped up production early in the year out of fears that import restrictions could be put in place.\n\"Last year, when foreign buyers and Chinese producers made deals, the orders were mostly for half a year, different from before when the orders were always for a complete year,\" Cao Xinyu, deputy director of the China Chamber of Commerce for Import & Export of Textiles, said. \"This was because foreign buyers as well as Chinese textile companies are uncertain about the future.\"\nTrade experts have long predicted that with the end of quotas, China's efficient, low-cost manufacturing operations could dominate the $495 billion global textile and apparel trade, wiping out rivals not just in Europe and the United States but also some poorer countries, like Bangladesh and Cambodia.\nAlready, Mexico and several Central American countries have been among the early losers in the post-quota textile trade, according to Commerce Department data, with China eating into their share of the U.S. market.\nThere are still about 665,000 textile and apparel manufacturing jobs in the United States, according to textile officials. But experts believe most of those jobs are likely to vanish in a few years.\nLast week, the National Council of Textile Organizations said that 17,000 American jobs had already been lost this year, as 11 textile and apparel plants closed because they could not compete.\nTrade groups representing U.S. workers are lobbying the government to step in because they believe Chinese manufactures unfairly dominate the textile trade by relying on government subsidies and cheap labor.\n\"These numbers are as bad as we feared,\" said Cass Johnson, a spokesman for the National Council of Textile Organizations in Washington. \"The government needs to initiate safeguard action now or we could lose tens of thousands of jobs.\"\nBut many apparel makers say eventually China will dominate the industry.\n\"We will always go to the least expensive place,\" said Roger Williams, president of Warnaco Swimwear, part of Warnaco, one of the top makers. \"Once the issue of safeguards is settled, our comfort level will go up. There will be a shift to China over time.\"\n",

    "text": "Blind to the End\n2005-12-26T05:00:00.000Z\nLondon - ONE year ago today we stared aghast at images of the Southeast Asian tsunami. These were mostly improvised clips rendered all the more poignant by their amateurishness. Video cameras taken on vacation to record the everyday pleasures of the beach were suddenly turned to quivering utility as they documented the panic and mayhem of a natural disaster. Somehow, domestic pleasure turned on its head only added to the sense of chaos and loss. Who can forget the disbelief in the recorded voices? This can't be happening to us.\nHuman beings are never prepared for natural disasters. There is a kind of optimism built into our species that seems to prefer to live in the comfortable present rather than confront the possibility of destruction. It may happen, we seem to believe, but not now, and not to us. There is nothing new in this attitude.\nMount Vesuvius has been erupting since historical records began. The eruption of A.D. 79 both destroyed Pompeii and preserved it for posterity. Pliny the Younger starkly recorded the details in prose that can still be read as a scientific account; to him, the plume resembled a pine tree: \"It rose into the sky on a very long 'trunk' from which spread some 'branches.' \" Yet houses are still being erected today at vulnerable sites around Vesuvius, in the face of the geological inevitability of further eruptions.\nIn Naples, St. Januarius (better known as San Gennaro) is regarded as protector of the vulnerable city. After all, did he not miraculously intervene to save Naples from destruction in the eruptions of 1631 and 1707? His relics are revered almost as much today as they were 400 years ago. It seems that a saint's relics have not lost their potency, even in an age when we have a rational explanation for the convulsions of the earth. Disasters are still described as \"acts of God.\" Whenever a natural catastrophe occurs, old questions resurface. How can we reconcile tragedy with the idea of a beneficent deity? And with that question, the notion of punishment is never far behind.\nDisasters are heaped on mankind as a mark of our sinfulness. In a curious way, such explanations act as palliatives. They permit an intimate connection with nature that seems preferable to the brutal acceptance of an indifferent earth meting out random destruction upon its inhabitants, like a boot crushing an ant's nest. If classical religions were wont to attribute disasters to the wrath of the gods, even in this scientific age the old explanations still have their attractions. And who might not sneakily still wish to believe that a saint could intercede on our behalf?\nTo a geologist, there is nothing remarkable about the seismic events that caused last year's tsunami. The inexorable 52-millimeter-a-year movement of the tectonic plate underlying the Indian Ocean, and its inevitable subduction off the western edge of Sumatra, is bound to entail periodic quakes, and some of these will set off tsunamis. Tension builds, and the earth's lithosphere briefly shrugs to remove an irritation.\nThe rock record testifies to many such events in past millenniums. They are all part of the working of the great machine of the earth, which is as indifferent to our over-abundant little species as are the phases of the moon. However, unlike planetary clockwork, earthquakes are only predictable in the long run, and the anticipation of the particular event is still in its early days as \"hard science.\"\nAs if to heap Pelion on Ossa, a second great tectonic convulsion, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake, devastated Pakistan on Oct. 8. It was accompanied by landslides which made rapid deployment of aid impossible. If the gods really had wished to signal punishment for our species, no more exquisite scenario could have been devised.\nThe fact that this is just one of thousands of earthquakes which have occurred during the elevation of the Himalayas offers scant comfort. The Indian subcontinent continues its inexorable progress northwards, butting into Asia. The grandest mountain range on earth is the result; everything else is \"collateral damage.\" But the magisterial scale of the tectonics offers no consolation for the suffering on the ground. The time-scale is our conceptual problem. Tectonic events happen on a scale of hundreds to millions of years. Most humans find it hard to think beyond the life spans of their grandchildren. There is a psychological fault line between the human and the natural calibration of the world. Incomprehension fosters a kind of rose-tinted amnesia. If anything, the comparative comfort of modern (at least Western) life makes disasters the more unthinkable. We don't want to know.\nIT may not always have been so. It has been reported that before the tsunami elephants somehow knew how to read the signs and broke free to head for higher ground. Some of the Andaman Islanders had protocols handed down by oral tradition through the generations that knew how to recognize the approach of disaster. One of the saddest things about the tsunami was the incomprehension of the meaning of that withdrawal of the sea that preceded the big wave: a 10-year-old British girl saved many lives because she happened to have learned about such harbingers of disaster in the schoolroom. If we've lost instinctive knowledge, education must be the key.\nBut there is another kind of disaster. Many scientists think that the Gulf Coast hurricanes may be a symptom of climate change. Carbon emissions have been accelerating more rapidly within a generation or two: this is not the result of some creeping plate indifferent to the fate of humans; this is our responsibility. However, there is still the same, almost willful blindness to the dangers of climate change; after all, the sun still rises, the crops still ripen -- why worry?\nGeology tells us that there have been \"greenhouse worlds\" in the distant past. These have been times when seas flooded over continents. Even modest sea-level rises would spell the end of densely populated areas of the world like Bangladesh. In such a case, invoking the deity to look after us for the best is just pie in the sky. These are not \"acts of God\" but acts of man. We can grieve for the human consequences of plate tectonics, but we should be ashamed of the consequences of our own willing blindness.\nOp-Ed Contributor Richard Fortey, the senior paleontologist at the Natural History Museum in London, is the author of \"Earth: An Intimate History.\"",

    "text": "Queens Woman Killed by Stray Bullet Through Her Window\n2005-12-30T05:00:00.000Z\nIt is not clear what prompted Selina Akther to move toward a window of her fifth-floor apartment in Queens, the police said. Her two children were sleeping and her husband was on a phone call to Bangladesh in another room, so they did not see the stray bullet that crashed through the closed window and hit her in her right eye, leaving her an unintended homicide victim.\nIt was shortly before midnight on Wednesday when a man in the street below pulled the trigger of a 9-millimeter handgun at least five times, the police said. It was a rare violent occurrence in a precinct that encompasses the residential Briarwood neighborhood where Ms. Akther, who was 28, had lived with her family for more than two years.\nThe Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said last night that Danny Carpio, 23, had been charged with manslaughter and criminal possession of a weapon, both in the second degree, and was being held pending arraignment in Queens criminal court in Kew Gardens. Mr. Carpio, an Army private on home leave from Fort Hood, Tex., fired the gun when he ran into friends in the street after a night of revelry, said Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly.\n\"This individual puts himself at the scene,\" Mr. Kelly said. \"We believe he fired a gun in the air to celebrate his homecoming with friends in front of the location.\" Mr. Kelly said Private Carpio lives two blocks from Ms. Akther's home, but that there was no indication that the two knew each other.\nAccording to a law enforcement official, Private Carpio was extremely remorseful, and was cooperative in trying to help police find the gun, which he said he threw away after firing into the air. The official, who requested anonymity because the investigation was continuing, said Private Carpio had told investigators that while home on leave, he had visited his goddaughter, drank some beer and vodka, left his family and bumped into some old friends, and then, he said, did \"something real stupid.\"\nIt was not until the next morning that he saw on the news that a mother had been killed.\nIt was unclear if the gun had been issued by the military.\nAfter being shot, Ms. Akther lay bleeding on the living-room floor by the bullet-pocked window for about 20 minutes until her husband saw her and realized she was not breathing. A neighbor, Wilma Narciso, who lives upstairs, said that she heard the shots and that her husband saw several men walking away from the scene on 85th Road, and two of them climbing into a white sedan.\nThe next thing neighbors heard were the wails of Ms. Akther's husband, Golam Maola, 38, as he cradled her motionless body. He called 911 and then ran from their apartment looking for help, locking himself out in the process.\n\"He was screaming really, really badly,\" Ms. Narciso said. \"He was banging at his door. There was blood on his clothes. I said, 'What's the matter?' He was screaming like an animal. I got blood on me. He said, 'My wife is bleeding from her eye.' \" The bullet had penetrated her skull and exited the back of her head, the police said, and she was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.\nThe police said one thing was clear: Ms. Akther was not an intended target but an uninvolved bystander. Her friends and relatives were planning to surprise her tomorrow, her 29th birthday, with a party. It was also meant to celebrate New Year's Eve. Now her birthday and New Year's Eve will always fall around the time of her violent death, the 534th homicide in the city this year.\n\"It was a big surprise, New Year's and her birthday, on the same day,\" said Selina Parbin, who stood in the doorway of her apartment across the hall from Ms. Akther's, wiping tears from her eyes. Last month the women made traditional Bangladeshi food to celebrate Ms. Parbin's son's 16th birthday.\nPrivate Carpio's sister, Diana Carpio, 19, said in an interview that police officials came looking for her brother at their home at 7:30 a.m. yesterday. She said he had returned from the Texas military base on Wednesday. Others who knew him said he had gotten married before leaving for Texas in July and had been planning a wedding reception for today.\nThe shooting jolted the neighborhood of squat brick apartment buildings, wedged between the Grand Central Parkway and Queens Boulevard, where Ms. Akther and her husband lived with their daughter, Tanas, 10, and son, Tasim, 6, who are both students at Public School 117.\nTahina Colin, 36, a psychotherapist who has lived in the neighborhood nearly all her life, said it is a place of friendly daily rituals, where people, including many immigrants, ride the subway to work each morning and wave or say hello along the way.\n\"It's like everyone is on the same schedule, everyone knows each other,\" Ms. Colin said. \"If there is a strange car in the neighborhood, it stands out like a sore thumb. For an incident like this to happen, it's shocking.\"\nMs. Akther and Mr. Maola were born in Chittagong, Bangladesh, he the son of a clothing retailer, she the daughter of a teacher, but they did not know each other there. Their meeting was arranged by family and friends in October 1994, four years after he came to the United States and three years before she followed him here for good.\nMr. Maola worked at two jobs in New York, he said, selling coffee from one cart on 46th Street in Manhattan in the mornings and falafel from a different cart on the same street in the afternoons. His wife enjoyed staying at home, raising their children and browsing for T-shirts and jewelry, Ms. Parbin said.\nThe family's two-bedroom apartment was a warm home where they came together for meals, celebrated holidays and watched Indian television together at night, as they were doing on Wednesday before calling Mr. Maola's sisters in Bangladesh.\nStanding in Ms. Parbin's living room yesterday, Mr. Maola spoke of his wife as if she were still there.\n\"We came from our country to live life, a better life,\" he said. \"She is the best woman in the family. She is a really good woman.\"",

    "text": "Bono\n2005-09-21T05:00:00.000Z\nThe singer and global advocate, who was profiled in The Times Magazine, answers reader questions on world poverty and the U.N. summit meeting.\nQ. 1. I am the adoptive mother of a West African-born child with AIDS. Our family is often asked what the average American can do to make a difference, even the smallest dent, in the fight to control and treat AIDS in Africa. Which organizations in addition to DATA do you point people toward? Which agencies big and small are making the most difference on the ground? \nWhenever we listen to U2, my daughter never fails to say, \"I like this man's big voice, and Mom, he fights for Africa!\" Heartfelt thanks for your boundless and tireless generosity and evangelization for all Africans! - A reader in New York (name withheld upon request.)\nA. Question No. 1 is the No. 1 question we get asked: \"What can I do?\" President Truman said something like, \"If you give Americans the facts, they will do the right thing.\" He was right. But what is the \"right\" thing? A few ideas: sign up to the One Campaign to Make Poverty History at one.org. You'll be in the company of 2 million others, and we're looking for 10 million by the next election. This campaign is not asking for your money, we're asking for your voice A\u0302\u0097 to tell the president, the people up on Capitol Hill in Washington A\u0302\u0097 that AIDS and extreme poverty is something you want them to pay attention to. I've been in meetings in D.C. with people who've said they want to do more, but they don't think their electorate wants them to. The One Campaign is a movement of people who challenge them on that. A movement of people who believe that America is not just a country, but also an idea and at the very center of this idea is the embracing of people who want to be free and equal. These issues we're discussing today are today's battleground for equality. \nIf you want to give money, there are organizations in America doing extraordinary work in Africa. One Campaign members such as Care, Mercy Corps, World Vision, Oxfam America, Save the Children and many others. Keep-a-Child-Alive is another one, which pays for life-saving ARV [antiretroviral] medicines for children in Africa. \nQ. 2. With all of our pressing domestic concerns (education, health care, urban poverty) how can the average American be expected to empathize with Africa's problems? - Pete Jameson, Ligonier, Penn.\nA. I don't think it's a question of empathy. Americans are the most generous people in the world and the challenge isn't so much that people don't want to help, it's that they want to be sure what they do will help. There's no question these are tough choices to make when it comes to money, especially following the tragedy of Katrina, the inequalities that were exposed as the floods subsided. But it could be that the vulnerability we've seen on our television screens, pictures that look more like Mozambique than Mississippi, will increase empathy for others across the other side of the world whose vulnerability puts them at such risk. \nSomething strange happens in America when disaster strikes A\u0302\u0097 we saw it during 9/11 and we're seeing it now A\u0302\u0097 it's almost as if people are at their best in the worst of times, stronger when tending to the weak. It's an incredible thing, and very much at the heart of what makes America great. \nQ. 3. How do you combat the perception in the States (right or wrong) that aid in the form of money to Africa is akin to putting paper in fire A\u0302\u0097 that the cash ends up in the hands of unscrupulous African government officials? - Jason Avant, San Diego, Calif.\nA. Aid has become a dirty word, and not without reason. But practices are changing, and we're not in the business of redecorating presidential palaces. No more turning a blind eye to corruption (or even worse, being a part of it). Foreign assistance shouldn't be seen as \"aid\" but as \"investment\": start-up money for new democracies that are tackling corruption. This is the idea behind the Millennium Challenge approach. Ring-fencing the money is another way to do it. In Uganda, savings from debt cancellation were put into a Poverty Action Fund, and monitored by the people and organizations earmarked to get the money. Because of this system, three times as many children are going to school, and thousands of communities have clean water where before there was none. \nQ. 4. What is the most common reason that leaders give you for not offering more aid to Africa? - Patrick Brereton, Alexandria, Va.\nA. In the United States you'd expect it to be something like: \"This is America. You're Irish. Go home.\" But what we're usually told is they don't hear that these issues are important to the constituents they represent, i.e. the American people. That's why the One Campaign is so important. The second thing is suspicion around the effectiveness of aid. That's why new ways of spending the money are so important. In Europe, where we're just as much a pain in the arse, it's more or less the same fundamental issues. \nQ. 5. How do you feel about micro-loans and micro-enterprise as a tool to end world poverty A\u0302\u0097 by helping people help themselves to self-sufficiency? - Barry Stevens, Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, Costa Rica\nA. I met Professor Microcredit himself last week to discuss this. A very gracious, very great man: Mohammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. You know that mantra, \"Give a man a fish, he'll eat for a day. Teach a man to fish, he'll eat for a lifetime\"? It's missing something: microfinance is the fishing rod, the boat, the net, etc. Cash and dignity, side by side. Part of Professor Yunus's brilliance was to lend the money to women, who are much more reliable at paying back loans. Maybe the mantra should be: \"Give a man a fish, he'll eat for a day. Give a woman microcredit, she, her husband, her children and her extended family will eat for a lifetime.\"\nTo get long-term self-sufficiency, macro trade reform is kind of the other side of the coin to micro-grassroots empowerment. Different ways of getting to the same thing, but I think you need both.\nQ. 6. What is your opinion about the Brazilian government breaking the patents law to make HIV medicine? - Marcel De Lima, Sao Paulo, Brazil\nA. The AIDS pandemic is an emergency. People will look back at our generation with complete disbelief that we let 8,500 people die a day yet we had the drugs to save their lives that cost less than a dollar a day to make. I don't think Brazil had a choice. \nQ. 7. What effect will canceling debt have on the ability of poor African nations to borrow in the future? - Greg Hildebrandt, Oak Park, Calif. \nA. Off come the flyshades, out come the little round spectacles. Cancellation of old debts should have a positive effect on creditworthiness in the long-term if it's part of a bigger strategy (including more investment, trade, etc.) to push economic growth levels up while forcing poverty levels down. \nOn the debt part of this: make sure these countries get a clean slate, i.e. proper debts should be written off. Incrementalism can just add to moral hazard. Make sure the money freed up is spent well, invested in health, education and infrastructure. Don't give loans to countries that don't have strong enough economies to pay back the money, give grants instead. \nQ. 8. Where do you see the continent of Africa in 10 years? - Angela M. Slape, Saint Louis, Mo. \nA. Africa is a dazzling, shining, beautiful continent full of smart, spiritual people. We need to stop thinking of this continent as a burden, and start thinking of it as an adventure. The truth is that Africa is also an opportunity for us, a chance to show the world what we in Europe and America stand for at a time when the world really needs to know. Every nation has its hour of need; the rebuilding of Europe after the second World War was only possible because America came to our rescue with the Marshall Plan. The metaphor only goes so far, but if we can get a comprehensive plan like that for Africa it will help create the conditions for Africans to help themselves. Then, in the next decade, there could be an AIDS vaccine, and malaria vaccine; we could be buying our clothes from African companies, eating African chocolate, drinking African coffee processed in Africa rather than Switzerland. There's a lot of work to do to get there but it's possible. If not in 10 years, then in our lifetime. \nWorking on this stuff should not just be a moral imperative for our leaders, there's a political imperative coming. In dangerous times, post-9/11, America needs a strategic partnership with Africa. Forty percent of the population of Africa is Muslim. In a world where distance no longer determines who our neighbors are this is not just heart, it's smart. It's in our interest as well as theirs.\nQ. 9. I read the article in the magazine, and that was the first I had heard of the Millenium Challenge Fund. For clarification, is it a usual U.S. Congress thing, i.e. are the funds authorized but not appropriated? If not, how exactly do those funds get appropriated? What will be the fate of the Millenium Challenge Fund, or what plans for making it meaningful currently exist? - Margie Lawlor, Corning, N.Y.\nA. Bobby Shriver, co-founder of DATA, describes us as being in the \"Get the Check\" business. The balance of power between the president, the House and Senate means a lot can change between getting the check promised, written and finally cashed. The Milllenium Challenge is a brilliant idea, but has been very slow to get going. Congress didn't want to give the president the funding levels he'd requested until they saw that the program was working. Now the money has started to flow, results should start to follow, and it'll be easier to get the funding through Congress. This stuff is not easy. It needs the best and the brightest working on it with African governments. \nQ. 10. Do you think there will ever be a time when you go over to the other side of the barricades? Will there ever be just one too many broken promises that will make you join the great unwashed? People power has moved mountains. You know this because you know about Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement. If you put as much of your energy into people power instead of lobbying politicians, what do you think the outcome would be? Could you ever see yourself standing at the head of the march the way King did, demanding, instead of asking nicely? - Susie Long, Kilkenny, Ireland\nA. I'm a rock star: my natural home is on the barricades with a handkerchief over my face A\u0302\u0097 much hipper than putting on a suit and hanging out with politicians. But as the Edge has pointed out (with more than a little despair in his voice), I'd have lunch with the devil if I thought it would make a difference. Too many lives are being senselessly lost to let either ideology or partisan politics be the guardian of these issues. In the 21st century, 3,000 Africans are dying each day, mainly children, because of a mosquito bite; 6,500 Africans are dying a day of AIDS, a preventable treatable disease. This outrage is the same whether you're sitting in the Oval Office or banging a dustbin lid outside on the streets. We need both. \nAs well as lobbying, DATA has spent a lot of time working alongside others on the One campaign to help build a movement in America so that in the future if a politician fails to keep their promises there is a political price to pay. Conversely, if they do the right thing they deserve to get the applause. The idea is to build an N.R.A.-type organization to get to work on behalf of the poorest of the poor. That's never been done before on our issues. We'll march alright, first on our own indifference, then on the body politic and I'll be proud to be a part of it A\u0302\u0097 at the front or at the back.\nBonus: Music Q&A\nQ. 11. For most bands that have been together as long as you have, the members usually do side projects to explore stuff outside the band. I'm curious ifany of you have A\u0302\u0097 and if not, why not? - Marshall McDonald, New York\nA. Well, there have been a couple of side projects. The truth is that U2 is elastic enough to contain all of our musical ambitions. There is no one mood that dominates, so if Larry wanted to do an Irish folk song or if Edge wanted to score some symphonic stuff, U2 can accommodate that. Our songwriting is an interesting case in point: we all work to realize each other's ambitions. I will try out a melodic idea of Larry's, Edge will try a guitar idea of Adam's or mine, Larry will try a drum beat of Edge's, etc. There are no lines of demarcation in the studio with U2. For that reason we are less likely to stray to side projects.\nQ. 12. What are your favorite pubs in Dublin for trad music? - James Flood, Pittsburgh, Penn.\nA. My favorite pubs are any that let you drink in after hours. As for traditional music, all over Temple Bar in Dublin. If in Howth Head, check out Sharon Shannon A\u0302\u0097 still a genius. ",

But Bah said the attack occurred in an area where the Nationalist and Integrationist Front, a militia, is active.\nThe security situation in the region has deteriorated in recent weeks despite UN operations to dismantle militia camps run by groups that have been terrorizing villagers. Militias have gone on a spree of looting, rape and murder, driving more than 70,000 people from their homes.\nThe peacekeepers began their operations in December.\nOn Thursday, the UN mission arrested 30 people in the northern town of Datule, including 27 suspected members of the Nationalist and Integrationist Front.\nThe displaced have generally been resettled at sites protected by peacekeepers and have received, until mid-January, emergency humanitarian assistance from Unicef and the World Food Program.\nThe United Nations has been targeted in attacks in Ituri in the past. Two Monuc military observers were killed there in May 2003 and another in February 2004.\nThe United Nations has a 4,800-person force in Ituri that is made up of contingents from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Morocco and Nepal.\nThe total UN force in Congo numbers 16,000, making it the body's biggest peacekeeping operation.\n",

They lived with relatives and struggled to get by on low-paying jobs in New York City.\nTheir oldest daughter, Hasuhana, 14, had accompanied Mr. Chowdhury to the United States. Soon after Ms. Chowdhury arrived from Dhaka, she became pregnant and gave birth to a second daughter, Jahanara, 11. Other girls followed: Majarhan, 8; Tahera, 5; and Rahima, 2.\nNow, Ms. Chowdhury, 34, is in a cramped two-bedroom apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, with five daughters and no husband.\nIn May, Mr. Chowdhury returned to Bangladesh to care for his mother. At first, he sent money, but stopped this summer, Ms. Chowdhury said.\nIt was one more trouble among many.\nIn 2001, while she was working as a cashier in a grocery store, three robbers entered. Thinking that Ms. Chowdhury owned the store and mistaking her limited English for resistance, they smashed a rock against her face. The blow knocked loose three teeth and led to crippling migraines and depression.\nAfter her youngest daughter was born in 2003, Ms. Chowdhury developed diabetes, hypothyroidism, kidney ailments and high cholesterol.\nIn a recent interview, Ms. Chowdhury went into the bedroom she shares with her two youngest girls and came out with a plastic bag filled with more than a dozen vials of medication. \"Look how much,\" she said.\nWith her husband gone and a loan from a relative exhausted, Ms. Chowdhury was no longer able to pay her rent, utilities and grocery bills.\nAt that low point, she found help from the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of the seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.\nMs. Chowdhury was referred to the bureau by the New York City Administration for Children's Services. The bureau provided a nanny eight hours a day, five days a week. Ms. Chowdhury is now able to keep her numerous medical appointments.\nThe bureau also kept the family from being evicted by paying nearly $1,600 in back rent. The Neediest Cases paid $169 for the phone bill and $643 for two beds to replace worn ones with broken box springs.\nAlso coming soon are $350 from the Neediest Cases to pay the electric bill and $500 for clothing.\n\"It's a start, but there's still more to do,\" Ms. Chowdhury's caseworker, Rosa Cabrera, said. The family needs a larger apartment, but Section 8 federal assistance for that is essentially frozen, she said.\nFor now, Ms. Chowdhury sleeps on the floor, partly to ease her ailing back but partly because there is no room. She strained her back recently when she slipped in her kitchen.\nMs. Chowdhury said her husband said he would return from Bangladesh in about two or three months, but that was months ago, and she does not know when he will be back.\n\"I don't like my life,\" she said, speaking quietly. \"But \" She did not go on.\nInstead, she kissed the forehead of her 2-year-old in her lap, as if to say that her life has some blessings.\nHOW TO HELP\nChecks payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund should be sent to 4 Chase Metrotech Center, 7th Floor East, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11245, or any of these\norganizations:\nBROOKLYN BUREAU OF COMMUNITY SERVICE 285 Schermerhorn Street Brooklyn, N.Y. 11217\nCATHOLIC CHARITIES, DIOCESE OF BROOKLYN AND QUEENS 191 Joralemon Street Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201\nCATHOLIC CHARITIES OF THE ARCHDIOCESE OF NEW YORK 1011 First Avenue New York, N.Y. 10022\nCHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY 105 East 22nd Street New York, N.Y. 10010\nCOMMUNITY SERVICE SOCIETY OF NEW YORK 105 East 22nd Street New York, N.Y. 10010\nFEDERATION OF PROTESTANT WELFARE AGENCIES 281 Park Avenue South New York, N.Y. 10010\nUJA-FEDERATION OF NEW YORK Church Street Station P.O.

    "text": "The people who have no country ...\n2005-02-18T05:00:00.000Z\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 There are millions of people in the world who are citizens of nowhere.They cannot vote, they cannot get jobs in most professions, they cannot own property or obtain a passport. These \"stateless\" people face discrimination, sexual and physical violence and socioeconomic hardship. Often they are denied access to health care and education.\nThe vulnerability of statelessness is captured in the words of a Bidoon living in the United Arab Emirates who asks: \"What have we done to be treated like animals? We can't get a job and can't move around. We are between the earth and the sky, like a boat without a port.\"\nThe 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights asserts that \"everyone has the right to a nationality.\" But statelessness remains a reality in all regions of the world. The exact numbers are not known, but a conservative estimate is 11 million stateless persons around the world. They include groups whose situation is relatively well recognized, like Europe's Roma, the Palestinians and the Kurds, and groups whose plight is virtually unknown, like people from the former Soviet bloc, some of Thailand's ethnic groups, the Bhutanese in Nepal, Muslim minorities in Burma and Sri Lanka, and ethnic minorities of the Great Lakes region of Africa like the Batwa \"Pygmy\" and the Banyamulenge.\nThe myriad causes of statelessness may include political upheaval, targeted discrimination (often for reasons of race or ethnicity), differences in laws between countries, laws relating to marriage and birth registration, expulsion of a people from a territory, nationality based only on descent (usually that of the father), abandonment and lack of means to register children.\nOne stateless population that the world has neglected are 250,000 to 300,000 Biharis (also called stranded Pakistanis), who were stripped of their citizenship after Bangladesh became a nation because they sided with West Pakistan during the struggle for independence. For the past two decades these people have lived in 66 squalid camps throughout Bangladesh. Recently the Bangladeshi government cut food rations to camps, forcing Bihari families to go without food for two or three days in a row.\nStates have the right to determine the procedures and conditions for acquisition and termination of citizenship, but statelessness and disputed nationality can only be addressed by the very governments that regularly breach the norms of protection and citizenship. To date, only 57 states are party to the 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, and even fewer, just 29 states, are party to the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. The United States has not signed either one. And despite its mandate, only two staff members in the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees focus on helping the world's stateless people.\nThe gap between rights and reality can be closed. Governments must respect the right of all individuals to have a nationality. Countries should sign and adhere to international standards to protect stateless people and reduce statelessness by facilitating naturalization processes. The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees can be strengthened as the lead agency in accordance with its mandate on statelessness. The United States, whose aid budget often helps countries who have stateless people within their borders, should certainly require and evaluate the protection of stateless people.\nPrevention and reduction of statelessness will contribute to the promotion of human rights, to an improved quality of life for those affected and to increased security around the globe. It will go a long way toward bringing millions of people closer to freedom, which truly gives the world its best hope for peace.\n",

    "text": "Looking for Recruits for the Frozen North? Try the Tropics\n2005-03-18T05:00:00.000Z\nFORT McMURRAY, Alberta, March 13 - Forty below zero isn't so bad once you get used to it. At least that was the message of a seminar at Keyano College called \"We Love the Winters Here,\" attended by 30 new immigrants from warm-blooded places like Venezuela and Nigeria, drawn here by the promise of hefty salaries in an oil boomtown.\nOf course, the lecturers noted, there are some important things to remember about living in this sub-Arctic town where winters last eight long, blustery months.\nFor one thing, children must be taught that it is dangerous to stick their tongues on freezing metal poles. There are risks to warming up a car inside the garage, and there are ways to drive out of a skid on an icy road.\nIt is all part of life in what was once a God-forsaken cowboy outpost until several multinational oil companies ratcheted up their oil sands operations here in recent years. In two decades, the population has nearly doubled, to 60,000 from 35,000. There is a lot of money to be made here, especially with oil prices over $50 a barrel, plenty of high-paying jobs and a real estate boom, which have all helped make just about everyone, blue-collar workers included, feel prosperous.\nBut few Canadians from relatively balmy places like Vancouver and Toronto have the gumption to live in these frigid climes, so oil company recruiters are looking far and wide. Amazingly, they are finding plenty of hearty, well-trained and highly motivated people from places where 70 degrees Fahrenheit is considered chilly.\n\"What do you prefer,\" asked Ligda Massicotte, 38, a lawyer who left the chaos of her native Venezuela four years ago. \"A country where there is kidnapping, crime, revolution, political uncertainty or a country that is cold where you have to put a hat on?\"\nNevertheless, Ms. Massicotte and her fellow English-language students at Keyano say the constant need to shovel snow and the short, dark days take some getting used to.\n\"When we first got here, my husband would say 'Let's go out,\"' she recalled, \"and I'd say, 'Oh honey, we have to dress the kids, two socks on each, then the long underwear, then the long-sleeve shirts, then the snow suit, then the mittens, then the hats, then the scarves.' Then as soon as you're ready one of the kids would pooh, and you'd have to start all over again. We'd always be an hour late.\"\nVenezuela, where President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez fired more than 5,000 employees at the state oil company after a failed general strike, has been particularly fertile recruiting ground for energy companies.\n\"When you are in Venezuela and you read the word 'cold,' you don't really know what that word means,\" said Cesar Mogollon, an electrical engineer with Suncor Energy who arrived from Venezuela in November.\n\"The first time I went out at minus 40 during a safety tour around the plant in early December, I was dying,\" he said. \"I felt pain in my nose and ears that went inside. I looked around at my colleagues and asked myself, 'Do they have different blood than me?\"'\nBut Mr. Mogollon said that once he found that local supermarkets carried the white maize flour dough used to make arepas and empanadas, \"I was O.K.\" He and his wife have adjusted, he said, and his 9-year-old daughter and 13-year-old son are snow tubing and skiing with gusto.\nAt least 4,000 foreign-born immigrants now live in Fort McMurray, and the number is growing fast. Local supermarkets carry halvah from Saudi Arabia, mango nectar from Egypt, jarred yellow cherries from Guatemala, rice sticks from the Philippines and marinating sauces from South Africa. There are cultural organizations for Latinos, Hindus, Filipinos and Chinese. The first Islamic school opened last year.\nMushtaque Ahmed, a 54-year-old engineer at Syncrude Canada, who was born in Bangladesh, has worked previously in Iraq and Saudi Arabia. He says that 10 families from Bangladesh arrived here in the last three years, and that they now get together to celebrate Bangladeshi holidays with potluck dinners that mix their native cooking with Canadian fare: typically roast turkey and assorted biryanis.\nThere has already been one marriage in the community, he said, and he is trying to persuade his brother-in-law to come here to open a Bangladeshi restaurant.\n\"I like the friendliness of the people here,\" Mr. Ahmed said, although he admitted to one misgiving that has nothing to do with the weather: \"I can get uncomfortable with what's on television. There's a lot of tolerance to things I am not accustomed to.\"\nImmigrants here, like immigrants everywhere, get homesick and cling to their native cultures.\nOswald Francis, a 52-year-old Jamaican-born bus driver, still wears a Jamaican flag on a bracelet and on a pin on his lapel. He came here for a three-week holiday in 1977 to visit friends, and never left, in large part because his wife thought this could be a good place to raise their two daughters.\n\"Canada is the best place in the world to live right now, and Fort McMurray is the best place in Canada to live because of the opportunities, the jobs, the money,\" he said while shopping for a long-distance calling card in a multicultural supermarket. \"As for the cold, I wouldn't call it an adjustment. You never get used to it.\"",

    "text": "New Concern on Polio Among Mecca Pilgrims\n2005-02-11T05:00:00.000Z\nA case of polio reached Mecca in Saudi Arabia, Islam's holy city, just before two million Muslims made the annual pilgrimage there last month, and World Health Organization officials now say the disease could spread to other countries, carried by returning pilgrims.\nIn crowded nations with spotty vaccination coverage like Bangladesh and Indonesia, \"there could be substantial consequences,\" Dr. Bruce Aylward, coordinator of the health organization's Global Polio Eradication Initiative, said in an interview from Geneva.\n\"This is a crucial point,\" he added. \"We're staring at the whites of the eyes of this thing.\"\nA spokesman at the Saudi Embassy in Washington said his country had feared the arrival of polio this year and started vaccinating 800,000 people in September, hoping to head it off before the height of the hajj, or pilgrimage, in late January.\nSaudi Arabia had been polio-free since 1995, but two cases were found late last year. The first was in Jidda, the port city 40 miles from Mecca where most pilgrims disembark. The patient was a Sudanese girl who became paralyzed on Nov. 6, just after arriving.\nThe second, more worrisome, case was confirmed just yesterday: that of a 5-year-old Nigerian boy who developed paralysis on Dec. 15. What made it troubling, Dr. Aylward said, was that his family had lived for several years in an illegal encampment on the outskirts of Mecca, so he must have caught a strain circulating in Saudi Arabia.\nSpotting new outbreaks in far-flung countries will still take weeks, experts said. Paralysis affects only about 1 in 200 carriers of the virus, symptoms can take up to 35 days to emerge, pilgrims traveling by bus or boat can take weeks to get home, and epidemiological reporting in poor countries is often slipshod.\n\"You want to be well into March before you breathe a sigh of relief,\" Dr. Aylward said.\nThe virus lives in the intestine and spreads through fecal-oral contact, so anything from changing a diaper to sharing a food dish or swimming in contaminated water can transmit it. Polio vaccination was not required for pilgrims, and even if it had been required, thousands arrive illegally, and many legal visitors carry forged immunization records, said the Saudi Embassy spokesman, Nail al-Jubeir.\n\"We have to trust the health services of the countries they come from,\" he said. \"We can't give everyone blood tests.\"\nVaccinations were required for meningococcal meningitis and, in some cases, yellow fever.\nPolio has been spreading from northern Nigeria since 2003, when vaccination campaigns there halted for months after Muslim imams and local politicians spread rumors that the vaccine could make women sterile or transmit AIDS, or was made with pork products.\nMost cases from that outbreak have been in the largely Muslim Sahel, the band of arid land south of the Sahara stretching from Mali to Ethiopia. The remaining pockets elsewhere are also mostly in Muslim areas -- Pakistan, northern India, Afghanistan and Egypt.\nEach case of paralysis implies that many more virus carriers are nearby. Most victims suffer symptoms no more serious than those of flu, but even people with no symptoms can spread the virus.\nIn 1988, when polio was endemic in 125 countries, the annual assembly of the health ministers of all nations in Geneva declared their intent to eradicate it by 2000. That target was missed, but $3 billion in vaccination campaigns drove the disease back until it existed in only six countries by the end of 2003.\nIt took until last summer for world health officials and senior clerics from other countries to persuade Nigerian Muslims to accept a vaccine made in Indonesia.\nBy that time, paralysis cases were appearing as far west as Mali and as far south as Botswana. \"In most of them, we were able to surround it and stop it from transmitting locally,\" said Dr. David L. Heymann, the W.H.O. director general's representative for polio eradication.\nThe most persistent spread was to the east. Sudan, which had been free of polio for three years, found a case from Chad in May 2004, and by late January it had 112.\nSome Sudanese officials blamed refugees fleeing fighting in southern Sudan, but Dr. Aylward said that made no sense because cases were exploding in Port Sudan, the jumping-off point for Mecca.\nAnother urgent worry of his, he said, is that the hundreds of truckers from landlocked Ethiopia who use Port Sudan will carry polio back home, where immunization rates have fallen.\nMr. Jubeir said the thousands of doctors Saudi Arabia hires in hajj season to screen pilgrims could not detect asymptomatic cases. Also, he said, the border police have caught as many as 52,000 people a month sneaking in, mostly from Africa, through Yemen. \"It's a nightmare,\" he said.\nDuring the hajj, vast crowds pressed tightly together circle the Grand Mosque and stone the pillars of Satan. Thousands live in government tent cities, but many camp illegally in the mountains around Mecca with little sanitation. \"Before terrorism, our biggest concern was disease,\" Mr. Jubeir said.",

    "text": "U.N. Forces Using Tougher Tactics to Secure Peace\n2005-05-23T05:00:00.000Z\nNAIROBI, Kenya, May 22 - The United Nations, burdened by its inability to stave off the mass killings in Rwanda in 1994 and by failed missions in Bosnia and Somalia, is allowing its peacekeepers to mount some of the most aggressive operations in its history.\nThe change has been evolving over the last decade, as the Security Council has adopted the notion of \"robust peacekeeping\" and rejected the idea that the mere presence of blue-helmeted soldiers on the ground helps quell combat.\nIt is most obvious in Congo, which commands by far the largest deployment of United Nations troops in the world. Peacekeepers in armored personnel carriers, facing enemy sniper attacks as they lumber through rugged dirt paths in the eastern Ituri region, are returning fire. Attack helicopters swoop down over the trees in search of tribal fighters. And peacekeepers are surrounding villages in militia strongholds and searching hut by hut for guns.\n\"The ghost of Rwanda lies very heavily over how the U.N. and the Security Council have chosen to deal with Ituri,\" said David Harland, a top official at the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations in New York.\nA turning point came in 2000 after rebels in Sierra Leone killed some peacekeepers and took hundreds more hostage. The United Nations commissioned a review, headed by Lakhdar Brahimi, a former foreign minister of Algeria, which called for troops to be deployed more rapidly in peace enforcement operations. \"No amount of good intentions can substitute for the fundamental ability to project credible force,\" the so-called Brahimi Report said.\nRecently a commander in eastern Congo, a Bangladeshi colonel named Hussain Mahmud Choudhury, pointed at a huge map in his office in Bunia, the regional capital, to show a reporter where his troops had been chasing the militias. \"Here, here, here,\" he said, banging on the map.\n\"If we hear they are somewhere, we move in,\" he said. \"We don't get them all the time, but they have to run. Their morale is shattered, and from a military point of view, that is everything.\"\nThe peacekeepers in Haiti, as well, are using Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, which allows them to protect their soldiers or innocent civilians by using force. Peace missions in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Kosovo, Burundi and Ivory Coast -- each with its own rules of engagement -- have also moved well beyond the traditional notion of peacekeeping in which blue helmets occupy a neutral zone between former combatants.\nBut nowhere do war and peace seem as cloudy as in Congo, where peacekeepers received a beefed-up mandate from the Security Council in 2003 -- and where at least one human rights group has complained of civilian casualties.\n\"The trend over the last decade is that you deal with many factions, factions that don't always have a political agenda and that are not always committed to peace,\" said Margaret Carey, an Africa specialist at the United Nations' peacekeeping office. \"Ituri is an extreme example.\"\nThe operation in Congo began as a modest observer mission in 1999. It has mushroomed, now commanding 16,500 soldiers -- but is still regarded as understaffed by United Nations officials in New York.\nAfter the failed missions of the 1990's, Western countries began contributing significantly fewer troops overseas. In 1998, about 45 percent of peacekeepers came from Western armies. The figure is now less than 10 percent; most now come from the developing world.\nIn Congo, most of the peacekeepers are Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and Nepalese.\nAs they root out the insurgents who prey on Ituri's population, United Nations soldiers in the east have at their disposal tanks, armored personnel carriers, Mi-25 attack helicopters, mortars and rocket-propelled grenade launchers -- all of which are getting heavy use.\n\"It may look like war but it's peacekeeping,\" said Lt. Gen. Babacar Gaye of Senegal, the force commander in Congo, of the largest and most robust of the 18 United Nations peacekeeping operations around the world.\nAt a militia camp in Kagaba recently, the peacekeepers backed up besieged Congolese troops and engaged in a running battle with ethnic Lendu fighters.\nIn March, after an ambush that killed nine Bangladeshi peacekeepers, the United Nations forces raided a crowded market near Loga to root out fighters preying on the local population. The peacekeepers also conduct what they call \"cordon and search\" operations, which are essentially hunts for weaponry in remote villages.\nTheir opponents are tribal fighters who ignored the United Nations deadline of April 1 for disarming. A last opportunity to comply is approaching; after that, the peacekeepers say they will get even tougher. As the United Nations has become more aggressive, many tribal warriors have disarmed. Of the 15,000 fighters that the United Nations estimates once operated in Ituri, nearly 14,000 have turned in their weapons. The holdouts are fierce, and show no signs of surrendering.\nIn February, militia fighters ambushed a group of Bangladeshi soldiers on a foot patrol around a camp of displaced people. Nine peacekeepers were killed, then mutilated.\nOn May 12, another Bangladeshi patrol was ambushed. This time, six were wounded and one was killed. At a memorial service, Dominique Aitouyahia-McAdams, the top civilian in the United Nations operation in Bunia, said the death would only embolden the operation in its quest for peace. She called those who killed the peacekeepers \"remnant militia bandits still marauding in the district.\"\nGeneral Gaye was in Bunia the other day to attend a lavish ceremony for the first anniversary of a peace deal that the militias signed, agreeing to give up their guns. Since that declaration, one of the half dozen militias in Ituri has disbanded, and others have shrunk to small bands. Various militia leaders have been arrested by the Congolese, with help from peacekeepers.\nBut the ceremony occurred a day after the memorial service, demonstrating that the job was not done.\nUnited Nations peacekeepers in Congo were not always so gung-ho. For years, they were criticized for huddling in their camps as atrocities recurred in the countryside. Now, some critics condemn them for being too aggressive. And critics also denounce the sexual abuse of girls by some peacekeepers.\nJustice Plus, a rights group based in Bunia, lamented that when the peacekeepers raided the market near Loga some civilians \"paid with their life while the mandate of the United Nations was to protect them.\"\nThe get-tough approach wins praise from those in Bunia who remember when, just two years ago, it was a battlefield between rival Hema and Lendu militias.\nAs Lendu militias chased Hemas out of Bunia in May 2003, Lea Assamba, 17, was confronted by armed Lendu men and threatened with death. She said she explained to them frantically that she was not a Hema but someone from another tribe, one not involved in Ituri's madness.\nThe militiamen made her suffer nonetheless. They killed a Hema girl standing by, and her body fell on Lea. They made her balance on her head the decapitated head of a Hema man, she said. The stranger's blood dripped down on her.\nLea escaped but was confronted by more marauding militias down the road. They shot some people standing next to her, and she dropped to the ground as they did. They died. She, covered with blood, was left for dead.\n\"Things would not be good if Monuc went away,\" Lea said, using the French acronym for the United Nations mission in Congo.\nBut not far from Bunia, awful things continue. Villagers are on the run. Men with guns and machetes chase them. In the midst of it, heavily armed United Nations soldiers are trying to extend their reach. They engage in something shy of war but also a long way from peace.",

    "text": "Farm Goods Impasse Stalls Trade Talks in Hong Kong\n2005-12-16T05:00:00.000Z\nHONG KONG, Dec. 15 - Global trade talks here are making little progress because of an impasse over agriculture, reinforcing worries that the negotiations may resolve little before ending late Sunday, trade ministers said Thursday.\nNegotiators for the United States and the European Union have been restating their positions, each trying to turn the debate to their favorite complaints against the other side, while reaching no meaningful compromises, officials on both sides said.\n\"There couldn't be any less negotiation,\" said Peter Mandelson, the European Union's trade commissioner, during a news conference on the third day of the World Trade Organization conference here.\nFurther complicating the talks on Thursday were renewed frictions between rich and poor countries over the extent to which new trade rules should permit greater international competition in banking and other services, with many poor countries seeking to limit access to their services markets.\nNegotiations to reduce import duties for manufactured goods have also bogged down, with a group of poor countries demanding that any such reductions be matched by similar cuts in rich countries' duties on farm products.\nSmall protests continued Thursday several blocks from the gathering but did not interrupt it.\nRob Portman, the United States trade representative, repeated the American position that the talks should focus on cutting tariffs and quotas for some of the agricultural commodities most heavily protected from international competition. The European Union wants to label 8 percent of total farm products as sensitive to imports, with only modest reductions in tariffs and increases in quotas.\nThe United States has asked that each country be permitted to label only 1 percent of farm products import-sensitive.\nEuropean officials repeated Thursday their position that the United States wanted unrealistically large reductions in farm tariffs and that it should give more cash, and less American-grown food, to poor countries.\nMr. Portman countered that the United States had been the main contributor of food in places like the Darfur region of Sudan, where so little food is grown that cash aid might result in higher food prices but not a reduction in starvation.\n\"I am more certain than ever, after the last few days, that agriculture remains the linchpin\" to a deal, Mr. Portman said.\nIn the absence of movement on agriculture, negotiators focused on a flurry of proposals to help very poor countries, especially calls for a deal to eliminate the remaining duties and quotas that rich countries impose on some imports from the poorest ones.\nMr. Portman asserted that the United States was already the biggest buyer of textiles and apparel from the world's poorest countries, and that it provided duty-free access for these products from many impoverished countries, especially in Africa. The United States intends to expand duty-free access to more countries and products, possibly including raw cotton from West Africa, he said.\nWest African nations have been calling for the Bush administration to reduce cotton subsidies, which it is doing, but have shown less interest in trying to export to the United States. Many textile mills that use cotton have moved from the United States to lower-wage countries. The United States now exports half of its cotton crop.\nMr. Portman cautioned that it would be hard for the United States to expand duty-free treatment to some categories of garments from Bangladesh, a poor and populous country that has alarmed American clothing manufacturers with its low costs and broad competitiveness.\nDuty-free treatment also may be hard to provide for textiles for one other country, he said, which he did not name; another American official said that country would be Cambodia, which ranks with Bangladesh as the two least-developed countries with the greatest textile and apparel exports to the United States.\nMr. Portman said that before the ministers leave Hong Kong, they should agree on a follow-up meeting by the end of March, probably in Geneva and possibly without all the ministers of the W.T.O.'s 149 member nations and customs territories.\nW.T.O. and American officials have said that a comprehensive deal must be concluded by the end of next year. That would permit legislation to carry out the accord to be submitted to Congress before June 30, 2007, when President Bush's special authority to negotiate trade agreements expires. Any agreement that came to a vote after that date could be heavily amended in the House or Senate, something other countries have described as unacceptable.\nSome countries have rejected what they describe as an attempt to stampede them with threats based on the American political calendar.",

    "text": "Impasse on Agriculture Impedes Progress at Trade Talks\n2005-12-15T05:00:00.000Z\nHONG KONG, Dec. 15 - Global trade talks here are making scant progress because of an impasse over agriculture, reinforcing worries that the negotiations may resolve little before ending on Sunday, trade ministers said today.\n Negotiators for the United States and the European Union have been restating existing positions and each trying to turn the debate to their favorite complaints against the other side, in public and in private, while reaching no meaningful compromises, officials on both sides said.\n \"There couldn't be any less negotiation,\" said Peter Mandelson, the European Union's trade commissioner, during a news conference on the third day of the World Trade Organization ministerial conference here. The conference is scheduled to end late Sunday night; small protests continued today several blocks from the gathering but did not interrupt the proceedings.\n Rob Portman, the United States trade representative, repeated the American position that the negotiations should focus on reducing tariffs and quotas for some of the agricultural commodities most heavily protected from international competition. The European Union wants to label 8 percent of all categories of farm products as sensitive to imports, with only modest reductions in tariffs and increases in quotas.\n The United States has called for each country to be allowed to label only 1 percent of farm products as import sensitive.\n European officials repeated today their position that the United States was calling for unrealistically large reductions in farm tariffs and that the United States should give more cash and less American-grown food to poor countries. Mr. Portman countered that the United States had been the main contributor of food in places like the Darfur region of Sudan, where so little food is grown that cash assistance might result in food inflation but not a reduction in starvation.\n \"I am more certain than ever, after the last few days, that agriculture remains the lynchpin\" to a deal, Mr. Portman said.\n Further complicating the talks here today were renewed frictions between rich and poor countries over the extent to which new trade rules should allow greater international competition in banking and other services, with many poor countries seeking to limit multinationals' access to their services markets.\n Negotiations to reduce import duties for manufactured goods have also bogged down, with a group of poor countries demanding that any such reductions be matched by similar cuts in rich countries' duties on farm products.\nIn the absence of movement on agriculture, negotiators focused instead on a flurry of proposals to help very poor countries, especially calls for a deal here eliminating the remaining duties and quotas that rich countries still impose on some imports from the world's poorest countries.\n Mr. Portman emphasized that the United States is already the biggest buyer of textiles and apparel from the world's poorest countries, and provides duty-free access for these products from many impoverished countries, especially in Africa. The United States intends to expand duty-free access to more countries and more products, possibly including raw cotton from West Africa, he said.\n West African nations have been calling for the Bush administration to reduce cotton subsidies, which it is in the process of doing, but have shown less interest in trying to export to the United States. Many cotton-using textile mills have moved from the United States to lower-wage countries, and the United States now exports half its own cotton crop.\n Mr. Portman cautioned that it would be hard for the United States to expand duty-free treatment to certain categories of garments of Bangladesh, a poor and populous country that has alarmed American clothing manufacturers with its low costs and broad competitiveness.\n Duty-free treatment also might be hard to provide for textiles for one other country, he said, without identifying the country; another American official indicated the other country would be Cambodia, which ranks with Bangladesh as the two least developed countries with the greatest textile and apparel exports to the United States.\n Mr. Portman suggested that before the ministers here go home, they should agree on a follow-up meeting by the end of March, probably in Geneva and possibly not involving all of the ministers of the W.T.O.'s 149 member nations and customs territories. W.T.O. and American officials have said repeatedly that a comprehensive deal needs to be concluded by the end of next year so that implementing legislation can be submitted to Congress before the expiration on June 30, 2007, of President Bush's special authority to negotiate trade agreements. Any agreement that comes to a vote after that date could be extensively amended in the House or Senate, which other countries have described as unacceptable.\n But some countries' ministers have rejected what they describe as an attempt to stampede them with threats based on the American political calendar.\n \"It's not the conclusion of this round but the content of this round that is important,\" said Kamal Nath, India's minister of commerce and industry, in an interview earlier this week.",

    "text": "In a Battle of Street-Food Vendors, the Wurst Wins\n2005-11-11T05:00:00.000Z\nThere was no red carpet or paparazzi. There was not even any heat last night at the first Vendy Awards, honoring New York City's street-food vendors.\nIn a garage on East Fourth Street used to store pushcarts at night, most of the food stands were moved outside to make room for an open bar, a disc jockey and about 250 people. They had bought $35 tickets to the event, a fund-raiser for the Street Vendor Project, an advocacy group that operates under the nonprofit Urban Justice Center.\nRolf Babiel, who has been selling sizzling sausages on the street since 1981, was crowned king of the pushcarts by judges who sampled the food of four finalists cooking from their portable kitchens. They had been winnowed from about 200 vendors nominated by fans.\n\"I've never won an award like this,\" Mr. Babiel said as the crowd chanted \"Vendor Power!\" in English, Spanish and French.\nInside the garage, Mr. Babiel and his brother Wolfgang tended rows of Schaller & Weber sausages from the menu-plastered cart, usually parked on the northwest corner of Fifth Avenue and 54th Street. He has also now has a beer garden, Hallo Berlin, on the West Side.\nA finalist, Thiru Kumar, also known as the Dosa Man of Washington Square Park, swirled lentil batter on his griddle and sprinkled it with turmeric potatoes.\nAnd Mohammed Elgohary and a co-worker from the Halal Gyro and Chicken stand at 53rd Street and Avenue of the Americas were generous with their famous white sauce, which they drizzled over slices of lamb.\nThe fourth finalist, Tony Dragonas, set up his cart outside, where he served the charcoal-grilled chicken that has won him a cult following at Madison Avenue and 62nd Street. \"I'm a street vendor,\" he said. \"I should be on the street.\"\nThe five judges, who waited in long lines with the rest of the attendees, voted on a variety of criteria, including food portability and vendor personality.\n\"They've got it hard,\" said one judge, Todd Coleman, who teaches a street food class at the Institute of Culinary Education. \"They cook in adverse conditions. They have to be social. And they always have to be at the top of their game.\"\nSean Basinski, the founder and director of the Street Vendor Project, said his group aims to raise awareness of the daily struggles facing the city's estimated 10,000 vendors of food and merchandise. It has fought the city's efforts to raise the maximum penalty for violations by vendors and has lobbied to increase the number of licenses issued. None of the four finalists are members of the Street Vendor Project, Mr. Basinski said, adding that they had been selling long enough and spoke English well enough to navigate the murky street vendor system.\n\"If they get a ticket,\" he said, \"they can pay it and keep working.\"\nMr. Kumar, who has been selling vegan dosas, wafer-thin South Indian crepes, for four years, said he waited years to get a license after emigrating from Sri Lanka in 1995.\nAfter getting a license, he then had to find a commercial kitchen to prepare the chutneys, sambals, soups and batters he stores behind the steel doors of his custom-designed cart.\nSome vendors are busier than restaurants. Earlier this week, about a dozen illegally parked cars served as dining rooms for Halal Gyro and Chicken, which is so popular that fans have set up a Web site, www.53rdand6th.com.\nNot all vendors enjoy such renown. \"I've got some regular customers,\" said Mohammed Mamun, a hot dog vendor who works in SoHo. He said he had thought about selling something different, like food from Bangladesh, the country he left in 1995. \"But it's risky.\"",

    "text": "Immigrant Victims of Abuse Are Illegally Denied Benefits, Suit Says\n2005-12-13T05:00:00.000Z\nHundreds of battered immigrant women and children are being illegally denied food stamps and other aid because of programming errors in New York welfare computers and faulty staff training, according to legal papers that poverty lawyers plan to file in federal court today.\nThe lawsuit is a last resort, the lawyers said, because city and state officials have failed to fix systemic problems that force many women to choose between staying safe and feeding their families, despite government policies aimed at supporting them until they can get on their feet.\nAt its most basic level, the problem lies in the pull-down computer menu that caseworkers use when they enter information about a noncitizen applying for aid. The list of eligible immigration categories mistakenly omits \"battered qualified alien,\" the category in which these women and children fit. So workers systematically reject them, with faulty state training manuals compounding the problem, the lawyers said.\n\"We have clients who have chosen to return to the abuser rather than not have food for their children,\" said Elizabeth S. Saylor, a lawyer with the Domestic Violence Project of the Legal Aid Society, one of the groups bringing the lawsuit in federal court in Manhattan as a class action. \"People try to escape, but what's worse for the children, to see their mom get abused, or to be in the shelter and go hungry?\"\nBob McHugh, a spokesman for the city's Human Resources Administration, defended the agency. \"We have worked every day, including with groups like Legal Aid, to make our delivery of service even better,\" he said. \"They've chosen to litigate this matter, so let them have their day in court.\"\nOfficials at the state Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance and the state Department of Health, also named as defendants, said they could not comment before reviewing the papers.\nThe papers describe the dark side of a common immigration story. Many of the women had come with children to join a husband in New York after years of separation, when their visas came through. But the reunions turned ugly, often after the woman had become pregnant again.\nThe abuse, documented in orders of protection, police reports and letters from domestic violence shelters, is not in question.\nMore than a dozen plaintiffs, mostly identified only by initials, include a woman from Senegal helping to prosecute the man accused of torturing her and murdering her sister; a Mexican mother of three whose abusive husband tracked her from Texas to New York; and a Bangladeshi woman whose husband, since hospitalized for mental illness, repeatedly kicked her in the stomach while she was pregnant, then cut up her clothes and threatened to kill her when she tried to go to work after the birth of their second daughter.\nLast year the Bangladeshi woman fled to a domestic violence shelter with her daughters, now 6 and 2. But when she applied for public benefits at a city Job Center, showing visas, work authorization cards, and proof of abuse, caseworkers wrongly told her that only the baby, a citizen, was eligible for aid, the papers say.\nIt took several efforts and a letter from a lawyer at the shelter to persuade officials that she and her 6-year-old were also eligible for help. Even then, supervisors could not figure out how to get around the computer system, the papers said, so it has repeatedly rejected the case for \"errors.\"\nAffidavits by lawyers who have handled scores of such cases depicted advocacy on behalf of individuals as a Kafkaesque cul de sac. Even though administrative \"fair hearings\" overrule denials, the decisions are worded too vaguely to overcome the conventional wisdom reinforced by the computer screen. A few times, workers managed to get around the system by filling in false information, but aid was soon cut off again, because the recipient's immigration documents did not match what had been entered in the computer.\nIn part, the situation reflects the complexities created when Congress restricted many federal benefits to newcomers in the 1996 welfare overhaul, then added a patchwork of exceptions. State programs filled other gaps.\n\"It's a nightmare,\" said a dressmaker from Jamaica who joined her husband legally with their two children last year, and fled with them to a homeless shelter when she was eight-and-a-half-months pregnant. Her abusive husband, she said, had threatened to feed rat poison to the children, who are 7 and 9.\nA caseworker denied her and the older children food stamps, cash assistance and Medicaid because they had no Social Security numbers to satisfy one of the computer prompts. They are now subsisting on school lunches and her newborn's allotment of aid: $68.50 every two weeks, and $119 a month in food stamps.\nIn an affidavit, she wrote: \"Although I am breastfeeding, I regularly do not eat enough because we do not have enough money. Because I am hungry, I oftentimes feel weak and suffer headaches. I have watched myself and my children lose weight and feel helpless to reverse it.\"\nFriday evening, as the baby slept in the crowded lobby of the homeless shelter, the children reminisced about what they used to eat in Jamaica.\n\"Sometimes we had chicken and rice,\" the boy said.\n\"And we had dumplings,\" the girl remembered.\n\"Salt fish!\" the boy added, eyeing the chips in the vending machines.\nAsked if he wanted to go back to Jamaica, he fell silent. \"I want to stay with my mommy,\" he whispered.",

    "text": "Duck Tongues and Other Security Threats\n2005-08-21T05:00:00.000Z\nNOTHING about George Tagro looked particularly criminal. Wearing a pink button-down shirt and a tired expression after his long flight from Ivory Coast, Mr. Tagro pushed a box through an X-ray machine in a federal inspection area at Kennedy International Airport when Officer Fred Skolnick leapt to his feet.\n\"There's food in there!\" Officer Skolnick shouted.\nMr. Tagro obligingly slit open the box to reveal carefully arranged bags of fine white couscous and hot red pepper. Underneath the couscous, Officer Skolnick, a gruff agricultural specialist with United States Customs and Border Protection, found the culprit: a foil package of succulent braised meat.\n\"What's that, grasscutter?\" said Officer Skolnick, referring to a rodent-like mammal found in Africa. \"This we're taking. Bush meat can't come in.\"\nMr. Tagro looked mournful as his meat was unceremoniously tossed into a yellow quarantine bucket. \"My children are going to be so upset,\" he said. \"They love that food.\"\nAs the city has taken stronger measures to prevent terrorism in its streets and subways, its major international airport has stepped up watchfulness to prevent agroterrorism, or the use of biological agents against the nation's food supply, including those that could spread foot-and-mouth disease or avian flu. The types of food or agricultural products that are confiscated vary from one country to another. Most of the people who run afoul of the rules are not terrorists but well-meaning travelers like Mr. Tagro, who are trying, sometimes sneakily but mostly innocently, to bring into the country a favorite food from home.\nWith J.F.K.'s busiest month in full swing -- one million people typically enter there from abroad in August -- the 85 agriculture specialists who work at its five international terminals have had their hands full.\nAs flights arrived the other day, the specialists often knew what to expect. \"There's Morocco,\" said Officer Skolnick, pointing to a crowd amassing around a baggage carousel. \"They bring a lot of fresh mints. Italy and France are good for charcuterie. Duck tongues and longans come in by the ton from China. In peak season, August to November, this table is loaded.\"\nA bushy-haired man just in from Montenegro watched as his suitcase was opened and a container of cooked pork confiscated. \"No problem, no problem,\" he muttered, thankful at least that he could keep his bottles of honey and apricot juice. A thin man from China frowned as four pressed, vacuum-sealed ducks and a package of kan lan, Chinese olives, were taken from his bag.\n\"Compared to Miami, which mostly gets South American flights, and California, which mostly gets flights from Asia,\" Officer Mike Russo said, \"what's amazing about this port is we get the world.\"\nLike a Manhattan epicure, Officer Russo ticked off some of the delicacies piled high on a steel table in the contraband room, to be ground up and incinerated after inspection: Bangladeshi jackfruit, Vietnamese pork sausage, Central American black corn, Nigerian garden eggs, Pakistani Alphonso mangoes. \"They'll say, 'It's for my pregnant daughter,' Officer William Tommasini noted. \"Or, 'I didn't know it was in there, my mother packed it.\"' But the most common plea, he said, is that the food is a taste of home that people cannot get here. The excuse sometimes leads to heated arguments.\n\"It's only a mango!\" passengers have been known to shout. Officer Tommasini doesn't buy this. \"Mangoes are public enemy No. 1.\"\nLike some human enemies, edible enemies sometimes slip through the system. Officer Russo remembered finding a bundle of mangoes hidden in the luggage of a woman who frequently traveled to and from Mexico. \"She looked at me with a totally straight face and said: 'I've brought them in 10 times before, and I'll probably bring them in 10 more times. This time I just got caught.\"' JENNIFER BLEYER",

It is imperative that India take the issue up at the United Nations and lobby to work out a consensus on the best way to restore democracy in Nepal. As we have seen, Beijing, Islamabad and Dhaka have been trying to fish in troubled waters by insisting that King Gyanendra's abolition of democracy is an internal matter for Nepal.If we were to bring up the issue at the UN, China, Pakistan and Bangladesh would be hard put to explain why they support a move inimical to democracy. It would also expose their own undemocratic systems of government as being the reason for their energetic espousal of King Gyanendra's action. The advantage of going to the UN is that any step taken to get the king to reverse his action acquires greater legitimacy.\nPersistent trans-Atlantic chill\n- Berliner Zeitung\nBERLIN: U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's visit to Chancellor Gerhard Schro\u0308der was little more than a photo opportunity. The most important result was \"keep smiling.\" Both were determined to be nice to each other even if they had different motives. The Iraq war is over, but the peace has not been won - and America needs all the help it can get in building a new democratic state. Neither Schro\u0308der nor President Jacques Chirac of France are saying no outright, but they are holding back with their offers to help. Their behavior seems to be characterized by schadenfreude - the Americans made their bed so now they have to lie in it. How much of the \"keep smiling\" offensive remains will be seen when President George W. Bush visits Europe. The dispute over policy toward Iran and the weapons embargo against China could quickly lead to a new crisis in relations.\nAnnan and the oil-for-food scandal\n- Montreal Gazette\nMONTREAL: Kofi Annan, secretary general of the United Nations, now says he wants to know the truth about the multibillion-dollar Iraq oil-for-food scandal. This is a refreshing change of policy for Annan, who always made it his business to look the other way. For years it was an open secret that big money was being made in shady ways around the well-intentioned scheme to let Saddam Hussein sell oil to acquire food and medicine. Oil did indeed flow out of Iraq, despite sanctions, and money flowed back in. Plenty stuck to the hands of Saddam's foreign partners. Annan's own son had a modest role. Now Annan has suspended two senior UN bureaucrats who were involved at the highest level in the program.Deciding what to do with the two will take many months, no doubt years. And all the while Annan, full of charm and honeyed words, will preside serenely.\n",

Coupled with a referendum that appears to have approved a new constitution, this has been a momentous week for the nation that suffered under his 24-year dictatorship. The false justification for invading Iraq in March 2003 and colossal misjudgments about the course of postwar events do not alter the importance of establishing democratic rule or of ensuring a just trial. It is vital for Iraqis and the global community, for reasons of security, harmony and justice, that these great tasks be done properly. It is regrettable that charges of crimes against humanity are not being heard in an international tribunal. If the idea is to expedite the humiliation of a tyrant in the hope of ending the insurgency, this could be yet another serious misjudgement.\n(The Age)\nRe-engagement with Latin America\nBALTIMORE: If its years of diplomatic neglect in Latin America have taught the Bush administration anything, it is that relatively young democracies can quickly revert to their old undemocratic selves. This year saw governments threatened in Peru and Nicaragua, a president driven from power in Bolivia, governmental repression consolidated in Venezuela, and U.S. influence in the region discredited.This month, Robert Zoellick, the deputy secretary of state, traveled to Nicaragua to show support for that country's elected president and to deliver a blunt warning to those trying to destabilize his presidency: Do so and lose $175 million in U.S. aid. This and other moves toward re-engagement are timely and, if done consistently, can signal U.S sincerity about being involved with its neighbors, not just when it suits national interests but also when it serves the interests of the region.\n(Baltimore Sun)\nNeglect of the world's hungry\nBANGALORE: The Food and Agricultural Organizationhas announced that more than six million people have died this year from hunger and another 850 million are suffering from chronic hunger and malnutrition. This means that more people die every year from hunger than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis put together. A third of the world's hungry live in India. India, Pakistan and Bangladesh account for half the world's hungry. The \"war against terrorism\" has consumed billions of dollars while the fight against hunger receives a pittance. There is a need to re-imagine security, to put poverty on the top of the global agenda and to tackle hunger on a war footing. Real security will remain a distant dream for the overwhelming majority in India as long as food security is not addressed. Security will seem meaningless if it is defined solely in terms of defense of territory.\n(Deccan Herald)\n<!-- Send a letter to the editor\n-->\n",

The Washington-based labor rights fund vigorously opposed the Central American Free Trade Agreement, which the Bush administration championed.\nIn the lawsuit, the overseas workers asserted that Wal-Mart had violated its contractual obligations to them by failing to ensure that the contractors they worked for complied with Wal-Mart's code of conduct. The lawsuit cited workers who said they were kicked and beaten, locked in factories, fired for supporting a union and not paid the minimum wage or overtime.\nSaying that its 200 inspectors made 12,000 monitoring visits last year, Wal-Mart said: \"If a violation is observed, Wal-Mart works constructively with suppliers so their factories correct the problems. We discontinue business with them if they fail to change their practices.\"\nWal-Mart said that the labor fund had ties to the United Food and Commercial Workers union and that the suit was an effort by the union to pressure Wal-Mart.\n\"We aggressively address problems and work proactively with suppliers' factories to improve conditions,\" Wal-Mart said. \"We believe sustainable results will come if we are able to convince suppliers and factories that compliance is an investment, not a cost.\"",

Duty-free treatment also might be hard to provide for textiles from another country, he said, without identifying it; another U.S. official indicated that the other country is Cambodia.\nPortman suggested that before the ministers left Hong Kong, they should agree on a follow-up meeting by the end of March, probably in Geneva and possibly not involving all of the ministers of the WTO's 149 member nations and customs territories.\nWTO and U.S. officials have said repeatedly that a comprehensive deal needs to be concluded by the end of next year so that implementing legislation could be submitted to the U.S. Congress before the 2007 expiration of President George W. Bush's special authority to negotiate trade agreements. Any agreement that comes to a vote after that could be extensively amended in the Congress, which other countries have described as unacceptable.\nBut some countries' ministers have rejected what they describe as an attempt to stampede them with threats based on the U.S. political calendar.\n\"It's not the conclusion of this round but the content of this round that is important,\" Kamal Nath, India's trade minister, said in an interview this week.\n",

    "text": "Ending Aid to Rich Farmers May Hurt the Poor Ones\n2005-12-18T05:00:00.000Z\nBY now, it's almost a truism: the protectionist agricultural farm policies of the big, rich nations -- mainly the European Union, the United States and Japan -- are essentially barring poor countries from development.\nThat belief is what led to much of the bickering last week between trade ministers from rich and poor countries at the World Trade Organization meeting in Hong Kong. Many development advocates argued that subsidies and tariff protections for farmers in industrialized countries lock poor farmers out of the rich world market. \"High tariffs keep them out of key markets, and tariffs and subsidies together drive down the world price of their exports,\" wrote Paul Wolfowitz, the head of the World Bank, in a recent opinion article in The Los Angeles Times. \"Without the income that trade could provide, it is their children who go hungry and who are deprived of clean water, medicines and other basic necessities of life.\"\nVirtually every economist will agree that agriculture is one of the world economy's most distorted sectors, and that dismantling industrialized nations' farm supports would give many farmers in the developing world better access to markets in wealthy countries.\nHowever, some economists are warning that if the industrialized world ends its farm subsidies and lowers its tariff barriers to agricultural imports, poor countries may not be helped, but harmed.\n\"Everybody is saying that the last barrier to the development of these poor countries are the subsidies in rich countries. That's the wrong diagnosis,\" said Arvind Panagariya, an economics professor at Columbia University. \"The least developed countries would be hurt by agricultural liberalization by the developed countries.\"\nIn a paper published in April, three economists -- Nava Ashraf from Harvard, Margaret McMillan from Tufts, and Alix Peterson Zwane from the University of California, Berkeley, concluded that agricultural supports boosted the per capita income of two-thirds of 77 developing nations, including most of the poorest countries, like Burundi and Zambia.\nDeveloping countries that are big agricultural exporters -- including Brazil, Argentina, Indonesia, Thailand -- are undoubtedly hurt by the farm subsidies. But these countries are not among the poorest.\nRather, many poor nations are big importers of farm goods, so they benefit from the lower agricultural prices caused by support policies in rich countries. Tariffs and subsidies keep cheaper imports out of the industrialized countries and encourage their local farmers to produce more. This raises the domestic prices of their farm goods. Yet, as it artificially boosts production of agricultural products, it pushes worldwide prices down.\nA 1999 study by economists Alex McCalla of the University of California, Davis, and Alberto Valdes of the World Bank, found that 105 of 148 developing countries, including 48 of the 63 poorest nations, imported more food than they sold. Some poor countries export nonfood agricultural products, like cotton. Yet even including these commodities, 85 of 148 developing countries and 30 of the 63 poorest imported more than they exported.\nTrue, some very poor nations, like Guyana, are food exporters. Yet even for them, Mr. Panagariya argues, the end of subsidies and tariffs might prove counterproductive, because some of their farm products can already enter the industrialized nations duty free.\nFor instance, most farm goods from the world's least developed countries get into the European Union without paying high tariffs under a preferential program called \"Everything but Arms.\" This allows the poorest nations to sell within the union at the artificially inflated European price. If the European Union were to dismantle its protections, letting its price for farm goods fall, these poor country exporters would be worse off.\nMr. Panagariya concedes there is one important exception to this argument: cotton. Europe doesn't produce or subsidize it. But the United States and China provide enormous subsidies to domestic producers. Depressed world cotton prices are intensely hurting African cotton farmers.\nYet even in this case, there is another side to the argument. Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries, imports cotton to feed its textile factories. Bangladesh isn't clamoring for an end to cotton subsidies because higher prices would hurt its main export industry.\nWilliam Cline, an economist at the Center for Global Development, argues that this analysis omits the fact that more than half the world's poor are in countries that are net agricultural exporters or that could become net exporters if the distortions were eliminated.\nYet what virtually all economists agree on is that developing countries could help themselves greatly by liberalizing their own agricultural markets.\nPoor countries often heavily protect their farmers, supporting vast uncompetitive agricultural sectors and drawing investment and labor into farming that would be better used elsewhere. Two World Bank economists, Kym Anderson and Will Martin, concluded that if the world were to dismantle its agricultural protections, most of the benefits for developing countries would come from the reduction of their own systems of farm support. \"Liberalization in the rich countries is a good thing, but in my opinion a small thing,\" said William Masters, a professor of resource economics at Purdue University and an expert on agriculture in Africa. \"Poor countries' own barriers are the biggest constraint to their own development.\"",

    "text": "'Hunger': Never Enough\n2005-09-18T05:00:00.000Z\nHUNGER\nAn Unnatural History.\nBy Sharman Apt Russell.\n262 pp. Basic Books. $23.95.\nCan't we humans get anything right? On the one hand, we are confronted all too often with caustic images of famine, most recently from the West African country of Niger: the starving children with their bas-relief bones and large, too-bright eyes, the gaunt mothers holding dying infants against their spent breasts.\nOn the other, we read a parade of stories about the \"obesity epidemic,\" the rampant outbreak of sedentary fatness that threatens to reverse gains in average life span and is by no means confined to the wealthy nations of the world. Must we ricochet mindlessly between alimentary extremes -- gluttony versus deprivation, supersized triglycerides versus the famine relief food wistfully named Plumpynut? Can't we manage our mouths and distribute the world's abundance with fairness and sanity, so that children never go hungry and diet books never get written?\nThe answer one might give after finishing \"Hunger: An Unnatural History\" is a sad, sardonic snort. Sharman Apt Russell may try to put an upbeat, forward-march gloss on the ancient problem of hunger's coexisting with plenty, and to argue that we can prevent tomorrow's versions of Niger or Somalia or Bangladesh with minimum effort and no need to \"diminish the complexity or diversity\" of our lives, but the bulk of her narrative suggests something else entirely -- that we are built on a restless, ravenous frame, a species for whom nothing seems so unnatural, so suspect, so unappetizing, as moderation. Because we are wired for chronic threats of famine, we are afflicted by chronic, troubling urges to gorge, grab and hoard. We grow hungry with startling ease. A few hours spent sleeping and hence not eating, and the entire cascade of foraging behavior is set in motion: we're ready to break the fast. We may carry 10, 20, 50 excess pounds of which we are quite cognitively aware, yet for some reason the giant mouth-print on our brain ignores the adipose stores and tells us we must eat more. Fat people get hungry after a foodless spell just as thin people do.\n\"Human beings evolved for a bad day of hunting, a bad week of hunting, a bad crop, a bad year of crops,\" Russell writes. The fossil record shows that we were hungry even in the \"Paleoterrific,\"as some anthropologists call that distant era of abundant game and few humans. Nor did our advances in food-gathering technology -- nets, snares, bows and arrows, agriculture -- ease the pang. Each innovation only encouraged the population to grow and crowd into ever-denser villages, increasing the risk of large-scale famines and epidemics. \"Small-game hunters were shorter and less nourished than their Paleolithic ancestors, farmers less healthy than hunters-and-gatherers, and city dwellers less robust than farmers,\" Russell writes. \"We just kept getting hungrier. It's no wonder we are programmed to pound the table and demand dinner.\"\nRussell, the author of \"Anatomy of a Rose\" and a writing instructor at Western New Mexico University, describes hunger from multiple angles: its biology, its political and cultural histories -- whether enforced by circumstances or freely, ascetically embraced -- and its deep psycho-emotional underbelly. Some sections of \"Hunger\" are excellent. Russell writes fascinating time-lapsed descriptions of how we digest our food, and deftly explains the metabolic differences in how and when the body wrests its energy from protein, carbohydrates and fats. She presents the gut as a tube that, for all its apparent internality, lies \"outside of our bodies,\" in the words of the neurogastroenterologist Michael Gerson. It is a \"tunnel that permits the exterior to run right through us,\" absorbing from a meal only the nutritious molecules it wants while keeping the greater, baser bulk of the externally derived fare external.\nEqually lucid but far grimmer is Russell's discussion of the notorious \"hunger disease studies\" of World War II, when Jewish doctors living in the Warsaw ghetto decided to examine and record the impact of starvation on every organ and system of the human body. With half a million people confined to the ghetto and many subsisting on no more than 800 calories a day, the researchers had no shortage of study subjects, including themselves. The doctors noted the macroscopic and microscopic edema of starvation, the way excess fluid collected between joints and in the chest and stomach, resulting in the characteristic famine paunch, and how the lack of vital nutrients caused the cell's pumping mechanisms to break down and the capillaries to begin leaking, and how the skin became \"pale, soft and cold,\" or covered with dirty brown splotches. Hair growth turned askew: teenagers might grow \"a fine fuzz all over the body,\" while adults over the age of 30 lost all their hair -- head, armpit, pubic. Children stopped playing and became pinched and solemn, middle-aged before their time; adults curled up in a fetal position on the floor and refused to rise. Autopsies revealed that starvation had caused the heart, liver, kidneys, spleen and muscles to shrink, and the bone marrow to turn to jelly; only the weight of the brain remained the same. The brain is the body's greediest consumer of calories. When not enough are supplied by food, the rest of the body, it seems, is gradually cannibalized to feed it.\nYet for all her gripping content and elegant style, Russell fails to pull her thematic threads together or to make any overarching point. As a result, the book feels wobbly and discursive, little more than a collection of interesting but scattershot stories about hunger: how it took six prison wardens to force a feeding tube down the throat of the suffragist Sylvia Pankhurst, whose protest fast was part of the struggle to win women's right to vote, and also in the long tradition of the hunger strike; the differences between how the Ik people of East Africa and the Alto people of Brazil respond to chronic food shortages; the common theme among all the world's major religions and many of its minor ones of the ritual fast; and the use of prolonged fasting to seek enlightenment or purge the stains of the body.\nThat we have deep-seated and contradictory feelings about our appetites is undeniable. That hunger for food can be a force more powerful than reason, common decency or love itself even overfed Westerners can well believe. As a scientist once said to me, \"Most of us are only nine meals away from murder.\" Yet in making sense of this sovereign, pitiless, archeo-urge, \"Hunger\" only whets the appetite; it doesn't fulfill it.\nNatalie Angier writes about science for The New York Times. Her upcoming book is \"The Canon: What Scientists Wish People Understood About Science.\"",

    "text": "The Larger Shame\n2005-09-06T05:00:00.000Z\nThe wretchedness coming across our television screens from Louisiana has illuminated the way children sometimes pay with their lives, even in America, for being born to poor families.\nIt has also underscored the Bush administration's ongoing reluctance or ineptitude in helping the poorest Americans. The scenes in New Orleans reminded me of the suffering I saw after a similar storm killed 130,000 people in Bangladesh in 1991 -- except that Bangladesh's government showed more urgency in trying to save its most vulnerable citizens.\nBut Hurricane Katrina also underscores a much larger problem: the growing number of Americans trapped in a never-ending cyclone of poverty. And while it may be too early to apportion blame definitively for the mishandling of the hurricane, even President Bush's own administration acknowledges that America's poverty is worsening on his watch.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau reported a few days ago that the poverty rate rose again last year, with 1.1 million more Americans living in poverty in 2004 than a year earlier. After declining sharply under Bill Clinton, the number of poor people has now risen 17 percent under Mr. Bush.\nIf it's shameful that we have bloated corpses on New Orleans streets, it's even more disgraceful that the infant mortality rate in America's capital is twice as high as in China's capital. That's right -- the number of babies who died before their first birthdays amounted to 11.5 per thousand live births in 2002 in Washington, compared with 4.6 in Beijing.\nIndeed, according to the United Nations Development Program, an African-American baby in Washington has less chance of surviving its first year than a baby born in urban parts of the state of Kerala in India.\nUnder Mr. Bush, the national infant mortality rate has risen for the first time since 1958. The U.S. ranks 43rd in the world in infant mortality, according to the C.I.A.'s World Factbook; if we could reach the level of Singapore, ranked No.1, we would save 18,900 children's lives each year.\nSo in some ways the poor children evacuated from New Orleans are the lucky ones because they may now get checkups and vaccinations. Nationally, 29 percent of children had no health insurance at some point in the last 12 months, and many get neither checkups nor vaccinations. On immunizations, the U.S. ranks 84th for measles and 89th for polio.\nOne of the most dispiriting elements of the catastrophe in New Orleans was the looting. I covered the 1995 earthquake that leveled much of Kobe, Japan, killing 5,500, and for days I searched there for any sign of criminal behavior. Finally I found a resident who had seen three men steal food. I asked him whether he was embarrassed that Japanese would engage in such thuggery.\n\"No, you misunderstand,\" he said firmly. \"These looters weren't Japanese. They were foreigners.\"\nThe reasons for this are complex and partly cultural, but one reason is that Japan has tried hard to stitch all Japanese together into the nation's social fabric. In contrast, the U.S. -- particularly under the Bush administration -- has systematically cut people out of the social fabric by redistributing wealth from the most vulnerable Americans to the most affluent.\nIt's not just that funds may have gone to Iraq rather than to the levees in New Orleans; it's also that money went to tax cuts for the wealthiest rather than vaccinations for children.\nNone of this is to suggest that there are easy solutions for American poverty. As Ronald Reagan once said, \"We fought a war on poverty, and poverty won.\" But we don't need to be that pessimistic -- in the late 1990's, we made real headway. A ray of hope is beautifully presented in one of the best books ever written on American poverty, \"American Dream,\" by my Times colleague Jason DeParle.\nSo the best monument to the catastrophe in New Orleans would be a serious national effort to address the poverty that afflicts the entire country. And in our shock and guilt, that may be politically feasible. Rich Lowry of The National Review, in defending Mr. Bush, offered an excellent suggestion: \"a grand right-left bargain that includes greater attention to out-of-wedlock births from the Left in exchange for the Right's support for more urban spending.\" That would be the best legacy possible for Katrina.\nOtherwise, long after the horrors have left TV screens, about 50 of the 77 babies who die each day, on average, will die needlessly, because of poverty. That's the larger hurricane of poverty that shames our land.\nOp-Ed Columnist E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com",

    "text": "Soldier Charged in Shooting Death of Woman at Window\n2005-12-31T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Army private accused of killing a Queens woman with a stray bullet from a gun he fired into the air was arraigned yesterday on manslaughter and weapons charges.\nThe arraignment of the private, Daniel Carpio, came on the same day as an emotional funeral for the woman, Selina Akther, 28, where angry mourners said that the private purposely shot her because she was a Muslim and that the killing should be prosecuted as a hate crime. Prosecutors and the police dismissed that claim.\nThe shooting occurred on Wednesday, the day after Private Carpio, 23, arrived home on holiday leave from Fort Hood, Tex. That night, after drinking some vodka and two 40-ounce beers, prosecutors say, the private began walking around his neighborhood with a 9-millimeter pistol that he bought illegally two years ago. About 11:15 p.m., he met some friends on 85th Road, and during a boisterous conversation, he shot the gun into the air several times, according to prosecutors with the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown.\nOne of the bullets pierced the window of Ms. Akther's fifth-floor apartment and struck her in the eye, the authorities said. When her husband, Golam Maola, came out of the bathroom several minutes later, he found his wife dead on the floor.\nPrivate Carpio was arraigned in Queens Criminal Court in Kew Gardens on charges of second-degree manslaughter, criminal possession of a weapon and tampering with physical evidence and was held in bail of $300,000, which by last night his family had not posted.\nAfterward, Samantha Seda, a Legal Aid lawyer representing Mr. Carpio, said about the case, \"It's just unbelievable,\" but refused to comment further.\nThough Private Carpio grew up two blocks from Ms. Akther's home, he did not know her or her family, friends said. The morning after the shooting, he awoke and saw the news of Ms. Akther's death on the television and decided to turn himself in at a nearby police station, the authorities said. He told detectives he had intended to shoot at the sky, not toward buildings or people, and called it, in retrospect, a \"stupid thing\" and expressed remorse. He discarded the gun while fleeing the scene on 143rd Street, prosecutors said.\nBut yesterday, as hundreds attended the funeral service for Ms. Akther, a Bengali immigrant, at the Jamaica Muslim Center, relatives disputed that account. \"This was a hate crime,\" said Jafor Mita, 38, a cousin of Mr. Maola's. \"This person was a member of the Army at war against Muslims. When a Muslim-looking woman came to the window, he shot her. This cannot be a mistake. He was a professional soldier. He knew how to shoot.\"\nMr. Maola, who attended the service with his daughter, Tanas, 10, and his son, Tasin, 6, nodded and blinked away tears.\n\"I want only for justice,\" he said.\nMs. Akther's body lay in an unfinished wood box bearing her name scrawled in black from a marker pen, along with the words \"Islamic Burial Shipping Svc.\" and the address in Chittagong, Bangladesh, where the body was to be shipped. The coffin was put outside in a small lot behind the mosque, her body facing east toward Mecca.",

    "text": "With a Push From the U.N., Water Reveals Its Secrets\n2005-07-26T05:00:00.000Z\nVIENNA - The forecast, courtesy of the United Nations, is grim.\nToday, more than a billion people lack access to safe drinking water. Polluted water contributes, each year, to the death of about 15 million children under age 5. By midcentury, between two billion and seven billion people will face water shortages.\n\"No region will be spared from the impact of this crisis,\" Koichiro Matsuura, director general of Unesco, recently warned. \"Water supplies are falling while the demand is dramatically growing.\"\nHe estimated that in the next two decades the average amount of water available per person on the planet will shrink by a third.\nBut the United Nations is also working hard on solutions, helping poor countries learn a subtle art that lets them better manage their water resources to avoid tragedy.\nThe method is known as isotope hydrology. Cheap and reliable, it takes advantage of the fact that water molecules carry unique fingerprints, based in part on differing proportions of the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes that constitute all water. Isotopes are forms of the same element that have variable numbers of neutrons in their nuclei.\nUsing the tools of isotope hydrology, scientists can discover the age, origins, size, flow and fate of a water source. And that information, in turn, can guide sound water-use policy, letting water engineers better map underground aquifers, conserve supplies and control pollution.\nFor instance, if the method reveals that the water in a well is young and recently derived from rain, villagers can pump away vigorously. But if it turns out to be very old -- what scientists call fossil water -- they need to move gingerly, taking care not to exhaust the water supply.\n\"You take it out once, like oil,\" Werner Burkart, head of the nuclear science programs of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in an interview.\nThe United Nations group, best known for fighting the spread of nuclear arms, is leading the hydrology effort. Based in Vienna, it works at developing techniques as well as sharing them with scientists around the world.\n\"We do a lot of capability building and training of local people, so it becomes sustainable -- so we don't have to inject support all the time,\" said Ana Mar\u00eda Cetto, the agency's head of technical cooperation. \"They're building their own capacity to manage their own resources.\"\nA little money goes a long way. Each year, the isotope hydrology program spends only about $2 million on research and $5 million to aid developing states. Still, that is enough to finance 84 projects in more than 50 countries, including Bangladesh, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Morocco and Senegal.\n\"If you look at the Middle East, everywhere you are using old water,\" said Pradeep Aggarwal, the head of the agency's isotope hydrology unit. \"It was laid down 10,000, maybe 100,000 years ago. So you have to understand there's a limit to how long this will go.\"\nAfter more than 25 years of cooperative work, the agency has gathered so much information that it is now fashioning a detailed portrait of the planet's water resources that could help prevent future crises and reduce regional friction that may erupt in water wars.\n\"We're talking about food security, sustainable development,\" Dr. Aggarwal said. \"If it's based on unsustainable water resources, you jeopardize everything.\"\nOceans and seas constitute 97 percent of the planet's waters. The remaining 3 percent is fresh water, most locked up as ice, soil moisture and deep groundwater. What is available to people -- mainly as rivers, lakes, aquifers, reservoirs and wetlands -- comes down to less than 1 percent.\nUsing that fresh water wisely requires considerable knowledge of the earth's water cycle, the outlines of which are well known, centering on evaporation and rain, runoff and seepage. But local riddles abound. The puzzles can include how often a particular body of water is renewed, where it flows and whether different bodies are physically linked through underground flows.\nIn the past, water engineers would address such unknowns by carefully measuring rain and the levels of rivers and other bodies of water for many decades -- typically a half-century or more. It usually took that long to learn the subtleties of the local cycles.\nHowever, isotope hydrology can do it in days, quickly illuminating water's passage through the depths. \"You really need to know how the water gets in and moves,\" said Dr. Aggarwal. \"Isotopics let you do that in a cost-effective way.\"\nThe raw material is everywhere. Air, soil and water naturally contain oxygen in two forms -- oxygen 16 and oxygen 18, which has two extra neutrons in its nucleus. Oxygen 18 represents about 1 oxygen atom in every 500. Because it is heavier than oxygen 16, more is left behind when water evaporates. As a result, seawater is rich in oxygen 18; rain and snow are relatively poor, and increasingly so the further inland they fall.\nThese gradients are echoed underground. The tools of isotope hydrology let scientists see the differences, creating a window into the depths. For instance, comparing samples from different wells can reveal whether the groundwater mixes or becomes isolated in separate pools.\nIn Ethiopia, the International Atomic Energy Agency used such techniques to help a foundering project. To supply water to the capital, Addis Ababa, the Ethiopians drilled 25 large wells, assuming that a not-too-distant river would renew the aquifer. But when the pumping started, water levels fell much faster than predicted.\n\"They didn't understand the hydrology,\" Dr. Aggarwal recalled. \"They came to us for help.\"\nIn a two-day survey, the agency discovered little connection between the river and the wells, prompting an overhaul of the project that put new emphasis on judicious use. Scientists have now mapped the speed and direction of the area's limited groundwater flow.\nEthiopia's reaction to the episode was to demand that its water scientists put greater emphasis on isotope hydrology, making it \"a standard tool for the country,\" said Mohamed ElBaradei, the agency's director general.\nOver continents and wide lands, the study of isotope signatures can reveal if aquifers flow under national borders, helping neighbors collaborate on the intelligent use of scarce water.\nThat is just what the atomic energy agency is doing in the blistering heat of the Eastern Sahara desert, with Libya, Chad, Egypt and Sudan. They have joined together to map the shared water resources of the Nubian aquifer, a vast subterranean body whose lobes range over nearly a million square miles, an area bigger than Iran and Iraq combined.\n\"We're trying to elucidate the connections,\" said Mokdad Maksoudi, an expert on African technical cooperation at the agency. \"Some parts of the aquifer are very old, with fossil water. Some are recharged through the Nile.\n\"We're trying to understand the recharge, so the countries can precisely gauge the best policies,\" he said.\nThe stakes are high because areas of fossil water are vulnerable to quick depletion.\nA main goal of isotope hydrology is to discover the age of groundwater, defined as the last time it had contact with the atmosphere.\nThis is calculated in many ways. Cool temperatures, for example, lower the concentrations of oxygen 18, and thus, unusually low amounts of the atom in groundwater imply that the body of water arose long ago, during ice ages and cooler climatic eras.\nA more exact way to determine age is to measure carbon 14, a radioactive isotope that water bears in minute quantities and that, with clocklike precision, steadily decays into other substances, allowing researchers to calculate the elapsed time.\nScientists have used such methods to address a humanitarian crisis in Bangladesh that the World Health Organization calls the \"largest mass poisoning of a population in history.\"\nMillions of people in Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries, drink arsenic-contaminated water, the poison gradually debilitating its victims before spawning cancers that kill them.\nGood intentions lay behind this horror. For decades, the government and aid groups had urged people to give up pond water, often a carrier of lethal disease, and instead to dig shallow wells. But no one tested the aquifers for arsenic.\nFor years, the atomic energy agency and its isotope hydrologists, using the carbon 14 and oxygen 18 methods, have worked closely with the Bangladeshis to help them map aquifer mazes and identify safer water supplies.\nThe news is mixed. The scientists have found that the arsenic tends to reside in shallow aquifers, and that deeper levels bear none of the deadly poison. In some cases, however, these deep aquifers have connections to the shallower ones, and pumping them out could draw in the contaminated water.\n\"So you can have water at 100 meters that is arsenic-free today, but could become polluted in the future,\" Dr. Aggarwal said.\nHe added that the teams have discovered even deeper waters that are unconnected to the surface and will probably stay pure. But the isotope-dating methods show that these very deep aquifers are old and not undergoing renewal, calling for careful conservation. \"If you pump it out in a major way,\" he said, \"it will hurt.\"\nThe flow of detailed hydrological information, he said, has been \"a tremendous boost\" to the government's understanding and has helped it make substantial changes in policy. \"Part of solving the problem,\" Dr. Aggarwal said, \"is to understand its origin and extent.\"\nExperts agree that hydrology will become even more important in the future, as growing water shortages intensify conflicts between states, whether or not they result in water wars. Some analysts see clean water as poised to supplant oil as the world's most contested natural resource.\nDr. Burkart of the atomic energy agency said that reliable information about the hidden world of water could only help dissipate international tensions.\n\"The more you know,\" he said, \"the better.\"",

    "text": "Derrick Z. Jackson: The real looters\n2005-09-03T05:00:00.000Z\n\nBOSTON \u2014 President George W. Bush told the television network ABC on Thursday, \"there ought to be zero tolerance of people breaking the law during an emergency such as this, whether it be looting or price-gouging at the gasoline pump or taking advantage of charitable giving or insurance fraud.\"\nZero tolerance is meaningless when the White House lets the biggest looters of Hurricane Katrina walk off with billions of dollars.\nWe are not referring to the people crashing through storefronts and wading through chest-high water with clothes, food and pharmaceuticals. Some folks are disgusting in their thuggishness, but many others are simply desperate, having gone for days without food or water. The latter are living out one of the most famous hypothetical problems in moral reasoning: Should a husband steal a cancer drug he cannot afford for his dying wife?\nNo such sympathy is to be extended to big oil. The United States has on its hands a disaster so profound that we have not even begun to seriously count the bodies in the floodwaters. It brings us as close as we may get in our lifetime to places like Bangladesh.\nNew Orleans is under martial law and will not return to normal for years. Members of the Red Cross, the Coast Guard, the National Guard, police agencies and firefighters are sacrificing time and risking lives to save lives. Texas is opening up its schools for homeless Louisiana children. Generous food wholesalers are giving away their stocks.\nIn the midst of this charity, big oil looted America. The pumps instantly shot past $3 a gallon, with $4 a gallon well in sight.\nIn a thinly disguised attempt to act as if it cared about the people wading in the water, Chevron has pledged $5 million to relief efforts. ExxonMobil and Shell have pledged $2 million apiece. British Petroleum and Citgo have pledged $1 million each.\nThis is nothing next to their wealth. Of the world's seven most profitable corporations, four are ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, and Chevron. ExxonMobil is the world's most profitable company, making $25.3 billion last year. It and the other three corporations had combined profits last year of $72.8 billion.\nAnd that was last year. A month ago, ExxonMobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips announced record second-quarter profits of $7.6 billion, $3.7 billion, and $3.1 billion, respectively. Royal Dutch Shell's quarterly profits of $5.2 billion were up by 34 percent over the same period last year.\nIf ExxonMobil were to maintain its current pace of profits, it would cross the $30 billion barrier for 2005. The company's chief financial officer, Henry Hubble, bragged in classic corporatese, \"Our disciplined project management and operating practices deliver the benefits of strong industry conditions to our shareholders.\"\nThose disciplined operating practices are hardly confined to the oil fields. Everyone knows that Bush does not really mean what he says about price-gouging at the pump, since he just gave energy companies the bulk of $14.5 billion in tax breaks in the new energy bill. Surprise, surprise. In Bush's two elections, oil and gas companies gave Republicans 79 percent of their $61.5 million in campaign contributions, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\nIf Bush really meant what he said, he would call for a freeze or cap on gasoline prices, especially in the regions affected most dramatically by Katrina. He would challenge big oil to come up with a much more meaningful contribution to relief efforts.\nInsurance companies are expecting up to $25 billion in claims from Katrina. For ExxonMobil, which is headed to $30 billion in profits, to jack up prices at the pump and then only throw $2 million at relief efforts is unconscionable.\nThieves and desperate families are so much easier to catch on camera than comptrollers electronically stealing people's cash. It is not pleasant to see anyone loot a store. But big oil is looting America, and no one is declaring martial law on them.\n",

The money, public and private funds, will support arts programs for children around the country and pay for more performances at the center in Washington, including a joint project with Disney Theatrical Productions and Music Theater International. The center said that in December it would open its sixth theater, a 320-seat room to be used mainly for productions aimed at young audiences. Other new programs include the development of Web sites on the history of the performing arts and jazz, with performances, interviews and other features. In addition to sending artists into classrooms - in person and via computer and satellite technology - the center said that this spring it would begin offering a 15 percent discount on tickets for teachers to attend programs produced by the center. JOHN FILES\nGrammy Fallout\nDays after winning eight Grammy Awards, the posthumously released duets album with Ray Charles, \"Genius Loves Company\" has become the subject of a second lawsuit. A recording engineer had already sued Ray Charles Enterprises and Concord Records over credit on the album. And on Wednesday Don Mizell, a record producer and music executive, filed a suit in Los Angeles Superior Court for unspecified damages exceeding $1 million. In the suit - filed against Act III Communications, owner of Concord; Ray Charles Enterprises; and Starbucks, which sold large quantities of the album - Mr. Mizell contends that the companies are in breach of contract by using his concept for the album illegally. Representatives of Ray Charles Enterprises, Starbucks and Concord said they had not seen the complaint and could not comment. BEN SISARIO\nWriter in Exile Seeks New Home\nTaslima Nasreen, the Bangladeshi feminist writer who has been living in exile in Sweden, told Indian television that she was seeking citizenship in India, Reuters reported. Ms. Nasreen, 42, left Bangladesh in 1994 after months in hiding because of death threats she received from Islamic militants who called her writing blasphemous. \"I am a Bengali writer,\" she said in the interview. \"It is very important for me to be with the Bengali people, so I dream of living in Bengal, either east or west.\" East Bengal was the name for Bangladesh under British rule. BEN SISARIO\nAnswering Ashley Olsen\nThe National Enquirer says it isn't about to cave in to Ashley Olsen, who is suing it for $40 million in damages, in connection with an article under a headline that she says suggested she had been caught in a drug scandal. Responding to her suit for libel and invasion of privacy, Stuart Zakim, a spokesman for American Media, publisher of The National Enquirer, said yesterday, \"We stand by the published reports, and we will vigorously defend against the lawsuit.\"\n'American Idol' at Top\n When the spy television series \"Alias,\" with Jennifer Garner, returned for a fourth season last month, ABC's decision to pair it with the popular adventure show \"Lost\" seemed to be the cure for its ratings ills: the season premiere on Jan. 5 drew an estimated 16.05 million viewers, a strong showing. But each week since then the numbers for \"Alias\" have decreased. And being opposite the \"American Idol\" powerhouse at 9 p.m. has hurt it even more; this week's episode brought in an estimated audience of just 10.48 million. On Wednesday, as it has each night it has been on, \"American Idol\" carried Fox to a victory in Nielsen's overnight ratings. That was a notable feat this time, as this particular episode of the talent show consisted of no singing, just the top 44 contestants going before the judges one by one to hear a yes or no about moving on to the next round. KATE AURTHUR The Exorcist Reality Show\nA commercial television station in Britain that has already pushed the boundaries of British taste with programs on abortions and autopsies said it planned to run a program next week on an exorcism, arousing the disapproval of some clergy members. Channel 4 said that its program was a serious scientific investigation of what happens inside the brain during an exorcism, and cited a new field of research called neurotheology, which examines brain activity during religious experiences. The exorcism is to be performed by a nondenominational minister with a man he has been working with for some years, and the station said the man had been cleared by two psychologists. But the Bishop of Monmouth, a spokesman for the Episcopal Church in Britain, said: \"This is not the kind of ministry that should be done on TV. Anglican rules specify that it should take place with the minimum publicity. In these cases you are often dealing with very vulnerable and disturbed people who need to be in a safe environment. It's bound to be entertainment rather than anything scientific.\" PAM KENT\nHonors in Irish Theater\nGarry Hynes, widely regarded as the best living Irish stage director, received an award for her career at The Irish Times's annual theater celebration. Ms. Hynes is a co-founder of the Galway-based Druid Theater Company, which opened as the first professional company outside Dublin in 1975, and in 1998 Ms. Hynes became the first woman to win a Tony for directing, with a production of Martin McDonagh's \"Beauty Queen of Leenane.\" Last year she began a project to stage all seven plays by John Millington Synge, an effort that led to two more awards: best actress for Marie Mullen, another Druid co-founder and Tony winner for \"Beauty Queen,\" for \"The Tinker's Wedding\" and \"The Well of the Saints,\" and best supporting actress for Aisling O'Sullivan in the Synge classic, \"The Playboy of the Western World.\" The 2004 awards for best director and best production went to Lynne Parker and the Dublin company Rough Magic for \"Improbable Frequency,\" a musical comedy set during World War II.

    "text": "As Hitting Falls, Mets Tumble Back to .500 Mark\n2005-07-31T05:00:00.000Z\nHOUSTON, July 30 - The Mets will inevitably go on streaks and skids, but in the end, they always come back to their old friend .500.\nOne week ago, the Mets thought they had put this mark behind them forever when they left Shea Stadium four games over .500. Now, consistent and true, they have returned to that level place that has come to define their season.\nUnless the Mets do something drastic before Sunday's 4 p.m. trading deadline, they still look like the ultimate .500 team. They lost to the Houston Astros, 2-0, on Saturday night to even their record at 52-52. Of course, they have also been 42-42 and 32-32.\nOn this trip, the Mets are disproving Coors Field and Minute Maid Park as hitting havens. They have lost five games on the trip, scoring 10 runs in the process. On Saturday night in Houston, they had three hits, none for extra bases and none by a position player other than Jos\u00e9 Reyes. To avoid a four-game sweep, the Mets must beat Houston's opening-day starter, Roy Oswalt, with their No. 5 starter, Kazuhisa Ishii.\nA sign that the Mets might have been paying attention to the ongoing trade talks for Manny Ramirez, pitcher Tom Glavine wondered aloud before the game if he would really be starting, or if he would be on the way to Boston. His battery-mate, catcher Mike Piazza, then asked: \"Where am I going? Trade me to \"\n\"Bangladesh,\" Glavine said, playfully filling in the blank.\nGlavine was nearly untouchable against the Astros, giving up only a solo home run to Jason Lane, on the first pitch of the seventh inning, which happened to be a curveball. What made the homer so startling was that Lane was looking for the curve, and Glavine had only started to throw it for the first time in a couple of years.\nAsked how he felt after the game, Glavine said, \"You can't print the word I would use.\" He elaborated: \"If we're waiting for the front office to do something to make us better, we are here for the wrong reasons. We have enough talent to win our division or the wild card right now. But we've been like this all year long. Good series, bad series. Win some games and lose some games. That's why we're .500.\"\nGlavine and Houston's Andy Pettitte are two of the best left-handed pitchers of their generation, but Pettitte had the benefit of facing the Mets. Manager Willie Randolph, who started coaching the Yankees one year before Pettitte started pitching for them, saw his typically effective sinker and cutter. But Pettitte has also been throwing more fastballs over the outside corner recently, keeping the Mets clueless at the plate.\nCarlos Beltran, heckled and harassed throughout this series, struck out to end the game, the ultimate treat for the largest crowd at Minute Maid Park this season. Beltran, who left Houston for the Mets in the off-season, is 1 for 11 in the series and getting booed even when he fields base hits to center. \"When the game starts, nothing seems to go my way,\" Beltran said.\nIf the fans have intimidated Beltran, it is not a stretch to believe that his teammates have been distracted by trade reports. Closer Braden Looper, who generally works with a late lead, took the mound with a one-run deficit in the eighth inning and made a throwing error on a sacrifice bunt that allowed Houston to tack on a run. For the Mets, every run is starting to feel like five.\nThe Mets had their best chance to tie the score in the top of the eighth, when Chris Woodward reached second base with one out and Cliff Floyd batted as a pinch-hitter. But neither Floyd nor Reyes could come through, and Houston closer Brad Lidge did not allow a base runner in the ninth.\nThe Mets are back to .500 and back to the trading table, hoping to make a deal that fetches them a winning record. At this point, the odds on anything happening are about even.\nINSIDE PITCH\nThe Mets signed first baseman Wil Cordero to a minor league contract and sent him to Class AAA Norfolk. Cordero, 33, batted .118 for the Washington Nationals this season but has a .273 career average. Starting pitcher Steve Trachsel gave up three runs, including two homers, in his second rehabilitation start. Cliff Floyd, on Houston pitcher Roy Oswalt, who is starting Sunday and who hit him with pitches in each of his past two games against the Mets: \"If he hits me again, we're going to have problems.\"",

He cannot get sick. He has things to do.\nMr. Ivery is an office worker in a city of office workers. He works Mondays through Fridays, 9 to 5, in the biology department at Queens College. He answers the telephone, registers students for classes, and makes sure that professors get their mail. Then he walks to the home he shares with his mother in Flushing.\nAn average man, living an average life. But he is only 26, with plans to go to graduate school. He has things to do.\nGrowing up, he did not stand out among the 3,300 students at John Bowne High School, save for a brief speaking role in the school's production of \"Les Mis\u00e9rables.\" And he didn't stray far when he enrolled at Queens College, down the street, to become one student among some 17,000.\nHis only extracurricular activity was with the college's peer advisement program, which trains students to assist others in making the sometimes-difficult adjustment to college life. Soon, he was helping to recruit other students for the program.\nOne day in 2002, he met another one among the 17,000: Nidha Mubdi, a young student who wanted to become a peer adviser. The daughter of Bangladeshi immigrants living in Briarwood, Queens, she had a riveting smile and an upbeat demeanor that belied the life story she shared with him.\nIn August 1998, when she was 18, Ms. Mubdi was told she had leukemia. When she was 19, she underwent a bone marrow transplant. When she was 20, her kidneys failed -- the payment due from all that chemotherapy and medication -- and she began dialysis treatment.\nThrough bad movies and graduation parties and gentle teasing, a platonic friendship developed between this Muslim woman and this Methodist man. Mr. Ivery became accustomed to her dialysis routine. Three mornings a week, she sat for three hours in a medical office in Jackson Heights, hooked up to a machine that did the work her kidneys could not. After that, several hours of sleep. This was her life, at 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.\nA year ago, Mr. Ivery had an idea, but set it aside. No, he decided. No.\nThen, a few months ago, Ms. Mubdi e-mailed to her friends the address for her Web site, which included a section called \"My Story -- Looking For a Miracle.\" It began: \"Could you be a person of selfless sacrifice & godly humanity able to donate their spare kidney?\"\nThat idea returned to Mr. Ivery. Without telling his friend, he had his blood type checked and learned that it matched hers. Then he sent her an e-mail message that opened with a couple of goofy jokes and ended with the words: \"But if you want a kidney you can have mine.\"\nMs. Mubdi did not answer right away, and has trouble articulating why. In the past, others had expressed interest in donating a kidney, but for this reason and that reason those plans fell through. \"I was taken aback,\" she says.\nA WEEK later, the two friends went to a fast-food place on Union Turnpike. He had a vanilla milkshake, she had some strawberry-ice concoction, and they talked about it. She was surprised that he didn't have any questions about the process. He was surprised that she was so quiet -- brought to wordlessness, it seemed, by the enormousness of what was being offered. .\nThat evening, the Methodist gently patted the hand of the Muslim. \"To let her know it's all right,\" Mr. Ivery says.\nThe two friends underwent testing to confirm the compatibility between his kidney and her body. He had to meet with his \"transplant team.\" He had to have a C.T. scan. He had to be examined by a psychologist, to make sure he knew what he was doing.\nThrough it all, Ms. Mubdi has assured Mr. Ivery that he can still change his mind -- it would be all right. Mr. Ivery has assured her that this is what he wants to do. They both worry about complications, including the possibility of rejection.\nNow the time is upon them. Ms. Mubdi and Mr. Ivery are scheduled to report early Friday morning to New York-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital in Upper Manhattan. But they have been warned that the transplant will be postponed if either one of them gets sick.\nThat is why Mr. Ivery bundles up during these uncommonly mild autumn days.\nAbout New York E-mail: dabarry@nytimes.com",

    "text": "Reports of Mishandling Koran Bring Protest Worldwide\n2005-05-28T05:00:00.000Z\nISLAMABAD, Pakistan, May 27 - Thousands of Muslims joined hands Friday in waves of protest across the Muslim world to denounce reports that American interrogators at the prison camp at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, had desecrated the Koran.\nIslamic parties called for anti-American rallies in Pakistan, Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Middle East, mostly centered on Friday Prayer gatherings. Protesters chanted slogans and American flags were burned at some of the rallies. Still, most of the demonstrations were peaceful, according to news service reports.\nEmotions have boiled over in the Muslim world ever since the allegations of desecration spread through a brief article in Newsweek. The magazine retracted the desecration report last week, but an American military inquiry found five cases in which the Koran had been mishandled by interrogators and guards at Guant\u00e1namo.\nIn many Muslim countries, any disrespect to the Islamic holy book is blasphemous and punishable by death.\nIn Pakistan, President Pervez Musharraf told Christina Rocca, the American assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs, that Pakistanis were \"deeply dismayed\" by the reports.\nThousands of protesters in Pakistan spilled onto the streets after Friday Prayer, responding to a call for protest by Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, an alliance of religious parties that won record votes in general elections in 2002.\nAngry protesters in Islamabad shouted anti-American slogans and held placards condemning President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair. One read, \"Bush and Blair are two big enemies of Muslims.\"\n\"We want Islamic revolution!\" Qazi Hussain Ahmed, the leader of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, said to a gathering of hundreds of followers in Islamabad. \"Are you with us?\" he asked, and the crowd chanted affirmation.\nThe religious alliance has been a vehement opponent of General Musharraf's support of the United States' military campaign in the region.\nPolice forces, expecting the rallies, were deployed outside mosques and other major gathering places across Pakistan. There were no reports of injuries.\nIn Egypt, about 12,000 protesters gathered in Alexandria, filling the streets, The Associated Press reported.\nIn Cairo, thousands gathered in the bar association's courtyard at a demonstration called by the Muslim Brotherhood, an outlawed Islamic opposition group. According to Gamal Taj el-Din, a lawyer and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, the demonstration was solely to condemn abuses against the Koran and not to call for reform in Egypt. But other demonstrators mixed the two issues, condemning crackdowns by President Hosni Mubarak.\nIn Lebanon, thousands of Sunni and Shiite protesters took to the streets after Friday Prayer in Sidon and Beirut's southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold. \"O America, listen, listen! With my blood I will protect my Koran!\" thousands of Shiite worshipers shouted in Arabic at a rally organized by Hezbollah.\nIn Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, Sunni demonstrators reportedly raised pictures of Osama bin Laden and the militant leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who is thought to be leading the anti-American insurgency in Iraq.\nIn Bangladesh, about 5,000 protesters shouted \"Death to America!\" and spit on an American flag, The A.P. reported.",

    "text": "Orthodoxies on Trade Worn Down in Marathon\n2005-12-20T05:00:00.000Z\nHONG KONG, Dec. 19 - The low point of the World Trade Organization conference here came on Saturday evening, as ministers were despairing of progress, while outside, protesters' steel pipes rained down on the shields of police officers and tear gas grenades spewed choking clouds.\nBut 30 hours later, Pascal Lamy, the W.T.O.'s director general, jubilantly handed John Tsang, the conference chairman, a ceremonial gavel. Mr. Tsang tapped the gavel once, closing the conference and approving the Hong Kong Declaration, calling for changes in trade barriers including subsidies for European farm exports and industrial nations' tariffs on imports from countries like Bangladesh and Zambia.\nTo be sure, the document papered over divisions on some of the most difficult issues in world trade, notably tariffs and quotas on such politically weighted products as apples, beef and rice.\nWhile the agreement requires the elimination of agricultural export subsidies, mostly used by the European Union, it leaves untouched even larger domestic subsidies to farmers by the United States and the Europeans that can also distort trade.\nNegotiators did not agree on how quickly industrial and farm tariffs should be cut, and they set rules for how to negotiate the opening of developing countries to service industries like banking without actually agreeing on any services.\nBut the declaration does require the elimination of industrial nations' tariffs and quotas on almost all exports from the world's poorest countries and does resolve disputes over cotton and other issues among developing countries that had led to the collapse of talks at the last W.T.O. conference two years ago in Canc\u00fan, Mexico.\nThe lengthy document produced here showed significantly more progress than anyone had expected when ministers from the 149 nations and customs territories in the W.T.O. convened here last Tuesday. It also allowed the ministers to avoid another collapse of talks.\nWhat changed in the 30 hours over the weekend was the weaving of a series of deals -- all night, in marathon talks.\nThe European Union, faced with blame for a collapse in negotiations, changed course and put forward a crucial proposal on agriculture.\nIndia, a champion of the developing world since the days of Mohandas K. Gandhi and now a computer programming power as well, played an important intermediary role in persuading poor countries to accept portions of the agreement calling for freer trade in services like telecommunications and banking.\nAnd Venezuela, forced to decide whether it would bring the negotiations to a dead halt over its objections to the provisions on services, backed down at the last moment and allowed the Hong Kong Declaration to be approved by consensus.\n\"Real progress was made,\" said a cheerful Susan Schwab, a deputy United States trade representative, on Sunday night as the ministers prepared to give final approval. Just a day earlier, Ms. Schwab was decidedly unhappy about the state of the conference. Talks with the European Union were going nowhere and acrimonious disputes were developing that pitted rich countries, especially the United States and the Europeans, against poor countries, many of them in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\"There are a range of points where this could go off the rails,\" Ms. Schwab said over lunch. \"The obvious dynamic everyone is worried about is this turning into another Canc\u00fan, with a North-South dispute.\"\nThe most contentious issue was an effort by a group of developing countries to restrict negotiations on the opening of international competition in services. Beginning Thursday evening, a coalition led by South Africa, Kenya, Jamaica, Venezuela and Cuba had been demanding changes in a proposed text to make it easier for countries essentially to opt out of the talks on services and shield domestic industries like hospital management, insurance and education.\nBy Friday, those countries had persuaded the broadest caucus of poor countries here, known as the Group of 90, to endorse their threat to block a consensus on the entire agreement. W.T.O. rules require unanimity for any agreement like Sunday's declaration; it was the first time in the six ministerial conferences since the formation of the W.T.O. in 1995 that services had turned into an issue that could potentially bring broader negotiations to a halt.\nAt the same time, the poor and the rich were struggling over the two issues that sank the Canc\u00fan talks: cotton and a broad category called trade facilitation that includes the likes of foreign aid and a streamlining of customs regulations.\nAmong the world's poorest nations are five in West and Central Africa that depend on cotton for two-thirds of their meager exports, and that blame American cotton subsidies for depressing global prices. Another deputy United States trade representative, Karan Bhatia, spent most of the week negotiating a complex plan for phasing out subsidies and providing American technical assistance to African farmers who have had much lower crop yields than farmers elsewhere.\nIn the trade facilitation talks, rich countries offered to eliminate tariffs and quotas on 90 percent to 95 percent of all categories of imports from the poorest nations and to increase foreign aid. But Zambia's trade minister, Dipak Patel, the leader of the W.T.O. caucus of least-developed nations, said in an interview on Friday that his group wanted a deadline for 100 percent coverage.\nEven the cotton-growing nations, who stood to gain from all the programs being offered here, were adamant that no matter what the United States offered them on cotton, they would still side with other poor countries on many other issues.\nChad's trade minister, Odjimbaye Soukate Ngarmbatinan, remarked, \"I don't think anyone should get the impression we would take what we can get and abandon our friends.\"\nThat stance underlined a vexing problem for American officials at these and other W.T.O. negotiations: their lack of influence in talks that require a consensus, yet can be derailed by a single country with a strongly held position. By contrast, the United States has much more influence in two-party pacts -- like recent free trade agreements with Morocco and Bahrain -- and regional accords like the North American Free Trade Agreement.\nThe United States trade representative, Rob Portman, and his senior aides had been warning in the weeks leading up to the Hong Kong conference that if these talks did not produce progress soon, the Bush administration might start putting more of its negotiating energy into the pursuit of such regional and two-party deals.\nWhile the negotiators wrangled inside the hall, the situation in the streets was deteriorating. Demonstrators armed with steel bars and pieces of plywood outflanked lines of helmeted riot police officers with shields. They began fighting less protected officers in the street in front of the convention center, and tried to push over a police van that blocked their path.\nThe officers responded by closing off streets, firing tear gas and parking armored personnel carriers on a nearby path to the convention center's entrance. As fighting continued at half a dozen locations, trade ministers who had left the convention center for dinner had to be brought back in boats along the harbor front.\nThe Hong Kong government said late Monday that 137 people had been injured in the fighting, including 67 police officers, and more than 1,000 people arrested, all but 14 of whom were released without charges on Sunday and Monday.\nInside the center, though, the negotiations were turning around, and Mr. Portman said in an interview on Saturday evening that he was beginning to see progress. The first big change was that after days of insistence by the European Union that it would not accept any deadline for phasing out farm export subsidies, European officials did just that.\nIn Brussels, European Union leaders had approved a new budget through 2013 on Saturday morning. Hours later, Peter Mandelson, the European trade commissioner, and Mariann Fischer Boel, the agriculture commissioner, gave a proposal to Mr. Portman and other negotiators that would set 2013 as the deadline as well for an end to subsidies.\nWhile the United States, Brazil, Australia and other farm exporters had been pressing for 2010, they accepted the deal.\nIn the talks to eliminate tariffs and quotas on goods from the poorest countries, Zambia won a commitment that 97 percent of goods should be covered. Support for 100 percent coverage was fading: countries like Kenya already have duty-free access to the United States, and realized that total coverage would give duty-free access for the first time to Bangladesh's extremely competitive garment industry. Bangladesh outsells Kenya in the American garment market, even though Bangladeshi companies face high tariffs and Kenyan companies do not.\nThe services talks were beginning to shift as well, a result in part of energetic efforts by India, a nation with enormous influence in the developing world. Until the 1990's, India had some of the world's most protectionist policies, and it still has high tariffs on imports like food and shoes. But the rise of telephone call centers, computer programming, accounting and financial analysis in cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad and Mumbai, formerly Bombay, has created a big lobby in India for offering these services to other countries.\nWith weary delegates negotiating all night, Kamal Nath, India's minister of commerce and industry, spoke strongly in favor of the services agreement at 5 a.m. on Sunday.\n\"It was music for the ears of the E.U. and the U.S.,\" he said in an interview.\nWhen the conference chairman, Mr. Tsang, asked all the ministers on Sunday night if anyone objected to the text of the declaration, leaders of the delegations from Venezuela and Cuba rose to say that they reserved the right to limit their countries' participation later in the talks on opening services. But neither official blocked the consensus.\nMr. Tsang tapped his new gavel and it was over.",

    "text": "A Hyphenated-American Dream\n2005-12-29T05:00:00.000Z\nA truly great city inspires truly great dreams, even during the days when all else seems lost.\nThere was no bleaker time in New York's history than 9/11. Yet it was then, with the restaurant where he had worked for six years -- Windows on the World -- in splinters and 73 of his fellow employees gone, that Silverio Moog's dream started to take shape.\nNow Mr. Moog, a spunky 41-year-old bartender from the Philippines, can hardly believe what is about to happen. Next week he'll go to work in a brand-new restaurant, and start a totally new life.\nRestaurants open in New York all the time, but there has never been one like this. Mr. Moog and 50 other waiters, busboys, bartenders and dishwashers, many of them immigrants who worked at Windows, have formed a cooperative that will run one of the city's first worker-owned restaurants.\nEach one of them will claim a piece of the restaurant, called Colors, as their own and share in any profits. Each one submitted a family recipe to help shape the restaurant's eclectic menu -- which they describe as American fare with a global twist. And each one has pinned lifelong dreams on an idea formed in the crucible of disaster.\n\"This is one of my American dreams, to be an owner of a business being run by immigrants who have a common goal,\" Mr. Moog said.\nThe possibilities and opportunities are wondrous, he said, and he is especially proud to see his Philippine Lobster Lumpia -- lobster and minted sweet potato spring rolls -- on the Colors menu.\nBut the reality of what he and the other workers are undertaking is daunting as well.\n\"I guess I'm a little bit scared,\" he said.\nAnd no wonder. With the failure rate of restaurants -- 60 percent after three years according to a recent Ohio State University study -- and all the vagaries of location, perception and the economy to deal with, even experienced, well-financed restaurateurs can stumble.\nWhile the co-op members have centuries of restaurant experience among them, they have never owned a business. So they brought in a professional, Stefan Mailvaganam, a Canadian citizen of Sri Lankan descent, to be general manager.\nMr. Mailvaganam realizes this is no ordinary job. \"What we are trying to do here is start a restaurant with a conscience,\" he told two dozen co-op members who gathered last week for a final training session. While he spoke, spacklers and carpenters rushed to complete their work. The restaurant, in Lower Manhattan a few doors down from the Public Theater, is scheduled to open for dinner on Tuesday. \"It's challenging,\" Mr. Mailvaganam said over the din of steel and wood, \"but we are committed to doing it.\"\nRarely has one project had to carry so many expectations. Besides memorializing the 73 who died in Windows, which was atop 1 World Trade Center, the co-op is trying to do no less than change an industry.\nNobody in the restaurant, not even the dishwashers, will receive less than $13.50 an hour, far higher than average restaurant wages. They will share tips and be eligible to receive overtime and vacations. Eventually they will be covered by health insurance and have pensions.\nAnd, of course, each will share in the profits of the restaurant, if and when there are profits.\n\"I am doing this for myself, for the workers who died and for all restaurant workers in the city,\" said Awal Ahmed, 43, a waiter from Bangladesh who worked at Windows for 17 years. \"It doesn't matter to me how much profit I get. It's like having a piece of my own restaurant.\"\nThe Sept. 11 attack forced many people to change their outlook on life. Surviving workers from Windows realized that nothing more than a simple matter of scheduling had determined who lived and who died.\nMany of the surviving workers were left scrambling for work. A cooperative restaurant was seen as a way of providing jobs as well as making a strong point about workers' rights. Money had to be raised, but traditional lenders balked, even after an Italian food cooperative put up $500,000 to support the project.\nSaru Jayaraman, executive director of the Restaurant Opportunities Center, which gets support from the restaurant workers union, said she thought workers would be eligible to receive the 9/11 financing available for rebuilding Lower Manhattan. But except for wage subsidies from Catholic Charities, they have not received any of that financial help.\nThe project has a budget of $2.2 million, which the co-op finally raised from more than 20 sources. Each worker contributed at least 100 hours of sweat equity.\nThe decision to open an expensive, 120-seat tablecloth restaurant in a good location, rather than a humbler place that would have cost much less, and opened a lot sooner, turned into a heated dispute that led several co-op members to leave.\nOthers left because the legal framework for the co-op was structured so that members' early profits go to pay back the Italian co-op.\nSome are still unhappy with how profits are to be shared. \"Our percentage keeps going down and down,\" said Khondoker Delwar, 43, a waiter from Bangladesh. But he's sticking with the project, he said, because it means his young daughter will know he was part of something noble that happened in New York.\nA successful co-operatively owned restaurant could become a powerful symbol. Juan Galan, an organizer with Local 100 of Unite Here, which represents hotel and restaurant workers, is trying to persuade co-op members to join the union because it would show owners how treating workers well can actually help increase profits.\nAnd the co-op members are joining the New York State Restaurant Association, an owners' lobby. At a recent co-op meeting, Rajani Adhikary, a policy organizer for the Restaurant Opportunities Center, a labor advocacy group that has been instrumental in forming the co-op, told members that by joining the association they would be helping all restaurant workers. \"You're going to be like spies,\" Ms. Adhikary told them, \"and tell us what they do so we will know more about them.\"\nE. Charles Hunt, executive vice president of the restaurant association, said the co-op members were welcome. \"We're on their side,\" Mr. Hunt said. \"We just don't see why they would feel they need to have spies amid our ranks.\"\nMost of the co-op members found other jobs while waiting for Colors to open. Magdi Labib, an Egyptian immigrant and a natural leader of the co-op, is doing well as a waiter at an expensive Midtown steakhouse. He said he would probably earn less at Colors, but he will make the switch anyway. \"I know that 6 out of 10 restaurants fail, but it's not going to happen here,\" said Mr. Labib, 51. \"Everyone is going to know how to do their job in a proficient way, and that's going to help.\"\nThe workers had planned to bring memorabilia from Windows to the new restaurant but abandoned that idea because they felt the constant reminder of what happened there would be too depressing.\nThe new restaurant will feature 1930's decor because the workers feel that era represented the height of labor power in New York. The name Colors reflects the 22 nations from which the members come, as will be shown on a giant mural in the restaurant.\nThese veteran restaurant workers realize that the emotional link to 9/11 will bring in diners, but it will become secondary to the things that really determine a restaurant's success -- service and food.\n\"Yes we have 9/11 and people who believe in workers' rights might come at first,\" said Fekkak Mamdouh, a former Windows waiter who now is assistant director of the Restaurant Opportunities Center, \"but if you don't give good service and good food, they won't come back.\"\nMr. Mamdouh said that if Colors fails, it will be a failure for all immigrants in the city. But if it succeeds, he said \"it will be a victory for all restaurant workers in New York, all immigrants and all people who believe in workers' rights.\"",

    "text": "A Thriving Market, And a Community Pillar\n2005-09-18T05:00:00.000Z\nCLIFTON - TO drivers zipping by on the Garden State Parkway, the beige-brown shingled sign for Corrado's Family Affair stands out just as much as it did when James Corrado and his three sons opened their produce market here 30 years ago. From the ground, though, it's clear that Corrado's has become something more. The store remains family owned by \"the triumvirate\" -- the brothers Peter, Joey and Jerry -- and managed by 8 of their 17 children. But the enterprise has expanded into a mini-empire that takes in 23 acres along the Crooks Avenue border that separates Paterson and Clifton.\nThe store hardly resembles its humble beginnings, though it sits just blocks from the Paterson farmers market where James Corrado first speculated in fresh fruits and vegetables in the 1950's and opened a retail store a decade later. Corrado's now sits entirely in Clifton, but it is still all Paterson in spirit. James's father, Pietro, started in the produce business at the downtown Island market in the 1920's and 1930's.\nIn many ways, Corrado's could be a business-school case study. It does not advertise, yet its 35 checkout registers hum even at 8 a.m. on a Monday; Sundays, the parking lot is a carnival spurred by the lure of fresh produce. The store primarily stocks produce, meats and fish. Corrado's sells little prepared food. This is a store for people who do their own cooking.\n\"We can sell a head of lettuce for 29 cents,\" explained Peter Corrado, 59, one of the ever-present Corrado brothers at the front of the store. \"Nobody can beat that, so why waste money on advertising? When people stop in, they stay to buy more.\"\nAlthough Mr. Corrado years ago gave up personally picking up produce from South Jersey farms, he is at work when two trailers roll in at 6 a.m. daily. September is canning season, and when families begin brewing their own tomato sauces from ripe Jersey reds, the store will move 600 to 800 bushels of tomatoes in a single day, and 30,000 in a season.\nCorrado's still draws many of the same Italian-American customers it originally served, but as Paterson and Clifton and surrounding areas have become more populated with Latino and Middle Eastern immigrants, so has the inventory and staff. A tub of fresh ricotta is bordered by globes of homemade mozzarella, and on a recent Sunday the store offered four types of fresh feta cheese (Romanian, Bulgarian, French and American). Red and green peppers are flanked by serranos, hot bananas and finger hots. Prickly pears imported from Mexico can be found among Sicilian, Italian, and Chinese eggplant.\nThe international flavor of the store is not a result of market research. Instead, customers asked, and the store responded, even when they were not sure what they were ordering.\n\"It started with tahini.\" Mr. Corrado said. \"Twenty years ago, Turkish immigrants came in looking for it. I had no idea what it was, but we got some. Now we have tahini from two countries.\"\nThe instrument that allows this diversification is laughably low-tech: the board.\nWhenever a customer asks for something not on the shelves, it's written \"on the board.\" When Corrado's vendors stop in, they check the board. If they can supply an item, the brothers have no qualms about taking a risk. Tahini, peppers, cilantro, avocados and different varieties of mango -- all unknown to the Paterson-born and Fair Lawn-raised Corrados -- became staples in the store because of the customers' initiative and the owners' listening skills.\nCorrado's revolves around the needs of its customers. In the 1970's, silk screeners with dye-stained hands would shop in the store after work; today, the mills that made Paterson the Silk City are long gone, but local retailers, Muslim halal butchers in nearby South Paterson and Latino laborers have replaced them. With a Bangladeshi floor supervisor and a multilingual staff, you get the feeling that anybody on the planet could shop in the store.\nThis unyielding embrace of change has not been the norm in sometimes nostalgia-mongering Paterson, New Jersey's third-largest city behind Newark and Camden.\nThe Corrado family's public departure from the farmers' market in the 1970's, spurred by rival shareholders who denied James Corrado a renewal on his lease, was less a departure from the city than a retreat from its politics. When Mr. Corrado bulldozed his sprawling old shed, moved up the street to Clifton, and established an enterprise that gilded the demographic and economic changes others were resisting, he rejected a mind-set -- not a locale.\nAs Paterson's 150,000 residents saw factory after factory close and vacant lots spring up to cover 12 percent of the city, Corrado's prospered. If Paterson is to be reborn, Mr. Corrado believes, it will be a grass-roots resurrection that happens one block at a time.\nCorrado's took a risk by expanding in a place that others had abandoned, embracing change and showing respect to local customers whose arrival others lamented. They offer variety without pretense. Of the feta cheeses, Mr. Corrado gestured toward one of his employees and said:. \"This isn't a fancy store like Zabar's. It's for people who cook. We're not a discount store, and I don't have time to describe each cheese to you on a little card, but if you want to taste it, that man will help you out.\"\nTry the cheese. Sniff the 20 feet of olives. If you don't find what you need, ask someone, then come back in two weeks.\nIt will go on the board.",

    "text": "The Pizza's Still Old World, Only Now the Old World's Tibet\n2005-07-31T05:00:00.000Z\nWhat do you say to the sushi chef who has just served you the most sublime yellowtail?\nOften these days, it is \"Gracias.\" New tides of immigration have so transformed New York City that classic ethnic foods and drinks are increasingly being prepared by people whose ethnicity does not necessarily match the menu's.\nExhibit A: the egg cream. For New Yorkers of a certain age, this was the nectar of a Jewish neighborhood, and Gem Spa was the drink's sacred temple, certified as such by magazines and travel writers. Gem Spa is still there, still turning out egg creams at its narrow patch of a soda fountain in the East Village. But the person who owns the store and taught the staff to make this curious concoction of seltzer, milk and chocolate syrup is Ray Patel, a 62-year-old immigrant from Gujarat state in India.\nHe learned the recipe, including the secret stirring motions that create a frothy head resembling beaten egg whites, from the previous owner (Italian), who learned it from the old owner (Jewish).\n\"People try to learn new things in a land of opportunity,\" is Mr. Patel's elegant explanation for how an Indian came to make a drink that is considered exotic west of the Hudson River, let alone in Gujarat.\nThe changing of the food guard has been so gradual that New Yorkers often don't notice that the falafel at their favorite stand has been whipped up by someone from Latin America.\nBut some of the changes have been striking.\nThe pastry chef at Brasserie La C\u00f4te Basque on West 55th Street is Ecuadorean. The pizza maker at Totonno's on Second Avenue and 80th Street is Tibetan. And one of the sushi chefs at Hatsuhana on East 48th Street, among the pioneers in initiating the city into the delights of raw fish, is Mexican.\nThe main reason for this phenomenon -- one observed across a nation being reshaped by newcomers -- is that the old immigrant pipeline is drying up. The Italians, Irish, Jews and French who once made their fortunes standing over steaming pots of spaghetti or slicing endless slivers of paper-thin Nova Scotia smoked salmon sent their children to graduate schools to become lawyers and doctors. Keita Sato, the president of Hatsuhana, who grew up on Long Island and was trained in the delicate art of sushi by his father, said that his Japanese-American friends preferred to become stockbrokers.\n\"The younger generation, it's not their No. 1 priority to be a sushi chef,\" said Mr. Sato.\nBut somebody has to layer the moussaka and coddle the crepes and, increasingly, those willing to put in the long sweaty hours are newcomers from Latin America and Asia. A study by Dr. Andrew A. Beveridge, a professor of sociology at Queens College, showed that the number of New York food service workers from South and Central America and the West Indies jumped to 54,105 in 2000 from 31,214 in 1990, and the number of Asian workers increased to 34,393 from 25,358, according to his analysis of census figures. By contrast, the proportion of native-born workers in food service dropped to 36.2 percent in 2000 from 55.3 percent in 1980. \"When the supply of your fellow ethnics isn't available to staff the place, you turn to the newest group on the block,\" said Joel Denker, author of \"The World on a Plate: A Tour Through the History of America's Ethnic Cuisine\" (Westview Press, 2003).\nRight now, according to Ed Levine, a food writer in New York, \"The work force in the food world is comprised primarily of Latinos.\" That explains why one of the best-selling books at Kitchen Arts & Letters at Lexington Avenue and 93d Street is \"Kitchen Spanish\" by Michael A. Friend and T.J. Loughran.\nWhile the new immigrant workers may start out behind the scenes as busboys and dishwashers, many rise to positions as chefs or counter people who master not just the art of preparing other cultures' foods but also the whole accompanying cultural repertoire. Kenny Sze, an immigrant from Hong Kong who started out in the 1970's as a teenager at Zabar's and trained to fillet herrings under the legendary Sam Cohen, owns Sable's Smoked Fish on Second Avenue and 78th Street. It claims it carries \"the world's best smoked salmon, sturgeon and caviar.\" His shop provided 35 pounds of caviar for the recent wedding of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's daughter Emma.\nHe has learned not only how to pick out a slab of nova before dawn at the right smokehouse, but also how to speak the smattering of Yiddish needed to kibitz with customers like former Mayor Edward I. Koch, for whom the patter is as important as the platter. In an interview, Mr. Koch exulted in the way Mr. Sze sometimes wraps lobster salad in a slice of sturgeon, and admitted that although \"it may not be Jewish, it's haute cuisine.\" Over all, he said, he appreciates the diversity in the city's ethnic kitchens.\n\"It adds an exoticism to it and increases my appetite,\" he said.\nSome ethnicities appropriate the food of other cultures that history had forced them to become familiar with. Albanians run many Italian restaurants, and Bangladeshis operate many of the Indian restaurants in the strip along East 6th Street. Some immigrants seize on an unfilled niche -- as the Greeks did decades ago when they recast the American diner or the Cambodians who run numerous doughnut shops in Southern California.\nArmando Martinez came to the United States in 1994 from the Mexican city of Puebla. One of his first jobs was as an all-purpose kitchen worker at a Japanese restaurant near Columbia University. He enjoyed the precision of boning fish and rolling rice so much that he moved up two years later to Hatsuhana, where the fish is flown in from Japan and where the care taken with sushi is on a far more demanding level. (It tries to observe the Japanese tradition that sushi preparation requires four years of priestlike training.)\nMr. Martinez, who lives in Astoria, Queens, with his wife and 19-month-old twins, worked his way up a year and a half ago to the sushi counter, where he and the other eight chefs pare off wedges of salmon and yellowtail and press them on beds of warm rice. A slender, genial man who was wearing a Yankees cap during a break, Mr. Martinez spoke of his love for the craft. \"I like to see a satisfied customer,\" he said. \"To do that, it takes a lot of work.\"\nMr. Sato is happy to have Mr. Martinez, since he says it is not easy to find skilled Japanese chefs. \"In the kitchen when we are right beside each other preparing the fish and rice, he puts me to shame,\" he said. \"He's better than most Japanese chefs.\"\nTotonno's, which was established in 1924 in Coney Island and claims to be the \"oldest continuously operating pizzeria in the U.S. run by the same family,\" has four locations but it despaired of filling them with Italian pizziolas, or pizza makers, and was not about to take just anybody.\n\"You have to have a feel for the dough,\" said Louise Ciminieri, granddaughter of the founder.\nPhuntsok Tashi came along just in time. Mr. Tashi, who is of Tibetan ancestry, immigrated five years ago from Dalhousie, India, in the western Himalayas, which has a large Tibetan community. A sister worked in a restaurant on Second Avenue and told him Totonno's, a few doors down, needed a busboy. Soon Brooklyn-bred Risa Pleger, a part-owner, asked him if he wanted to learn the art of molding and baking a pizza. He mastered the trick of flattening the dough and spreading patches of mozzarella, tomato sauce and Romano over it.\n\"You have to press it very nicely and evenly and then press it from the back,\" he said as he moved the pizza with a paddle inside a brick ovenheated to 1,100 degrees to prevent charring.\nRosa Vergara, 42, immigrated from Cuenca, Ecuador, 12 years ago and landed a job making jewelry for a garment district business. When the business failed five years ago, a Peruvian friend who worked at La C\u00f4te told her that the kitchen needed help. Jean-Jacques Rachou, the owner of the longtime institution of haute cuisine that has had two name changes and a makeover in recent years, said Mrs. Vergara worked under his pastry chefs and one day told him, \"'Give me the chance and I can show you I can do it.\"'\n\"And she does it,\" he said.\nThe decorative skills she had learned in the jewelry trade came in handy. As she spoke with a visitor, she squeezed chocolate and vanilla sauce from plastic bottles into neat zigzags to adorn a plate holding a raspberry mousse she made earlier in the day, then dappled the mousse with blueberries.\nMr. Rachou also taught the art of fashioning French delicacies to her 25-year-old sister, Mayra. He had to.\n\"French cooks don't come to America anymore,\" he said. \"They make more money in France.\"",

    "text": "For the Spice Rack That Has Everything\n2005-07-13T05:00:00.000Z\nNIRMALA NARINE has her eye on your spice rack. \"Spices are the soul of every cuisine,\" said Ms. Narine, 35, an entrepreneur in Long Island City, Queens. \"And as sophisticated as we may have become, there is still plenty to learn.\"\nWhat she would like home cooks to learn is that ground bush tomato, an Australian seasoning, adds richness to fish. That South African peri-peri, a chili blend, does wonders for scrambled eggs. And that ground lemon myrtle might send your herbes de Provence into early retirement.\nMs. Narine, who immigrated from Guyana with her family when she was 11, went to school in Queens, and graduated from John Jay College. \"I was always involved in food,\" she said. Her instinct for business flowered early. \"I remember growing habanero peppers when I was a kid, maybe I was 6, and selling them to buy shoes.\"\nHer determination to bring unusual spices to the American market began a few years ago when she visited a spice plantation on Zanzibar, off the coast of Tanzania. Having worked in real estate, run a limousine company and owned a gift basket company, she was interested in a new challenge. She started Nirmala's Kitchen three years ago, importing unusual spices, blending them, and selling them to specialty stores and online.\nMs. Narine has a particular sensibility to the blending of spices. \"You can't generalize about curries,\" she said, because the ones available in the Caribbean \"are vastly different from the ones you find in various parts of India.\"\nHer line includes six masala and curry blends from India, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Thailand and the West Indies, among others, each with a different keynote (cumin, chili or ginger). She has the spices roasted and ground, then blends them in her workshop and packs them in airtight metal tins.\nShe keeps green coconuts in the refrigerator in her office and a machete nearby, ready to whack off their tops, insert a straw and offer a visitor a refreshing thirst quencher. \"I used to use this machete to kill chickens,\" she said.\nShe has traveled to Asia, South America, Africa and the Middle East to find new spices and the sources for them. In the fall she plans to add new seasonings like sumac, Aleppo pepper and Oman black limes. She is devoted to indigenous cuisines in countries like Peru, Australia and Tanzania.\nIn addition to more than three dozen spices and blends, she imports seasoned rice, including a highly aromatic red rice from Kerala in southern India and spiced North African couscous. The grains, in clear plastic jars with bamboo paper tops, come preseasoned and ready to cook with the addition of water and olive oil to make four to six servings. She has some unusual salts, like a Japanese sea salt seasoned with matcha green tea powder.\nMost of the spices and grains are $6.95 to $13.95. They are sold at Dean & DeLuca, among other stores, and at nirmalaskitchen.com.\nSome of Ms. Narine's products are also sold in the gift shop at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. \"As well as my company is doing, I think I'm proudest of the recognition this gives me,\" she said.\nBroadening the Palate Is Their Specialty\nNIRMALA'S KITCHEN was among 2,300 exhibitors at the summer Fancy Food Show, a three-day trade show that closed yesterday at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. But it was not the only one hoping to broaden the American palate with a taste of the exotic.\nTaste of Malacca introduced a line of spices developed by Susheela Raghavan that included six Malaysian blends, for making curries and other dishes. In the fall Vanns Spices will begin selling fig powder, tart cherry powder and tamarind powder seasonings. Airborne Honey from New Zealand came in flavors of native flowers like rich vipers bugloss and manuka, which tasted like coffee. Restaurant LuLu in San Francisco introduced several condiments made with loquats, including a vinegar.\nPreserves made from wild fruits were among the items at a group of American Indian booths, a first at this show.\nWorthy newcomers in the snacks and chips category were Island Crisps, made from seeds of the melinjo tree on Bali. They had a nutty, buttery taste, better plain than the version with Indonesian long peppers. The Peruvian government pavilion exhibited excellent, colorful potato chips, one type made from the purple-and-white puma chaqui (puma claw).\nAnd an Irish brand, Tayto Fusion Potato Crisps, offered one nearly irresistible variety, seasoned to taste like roast beef.",

    "text": "London's Art Scene's Edge Moves Again\n2005-09-04T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE Young British Artists who made Hoxton in East London one of the city's trendiest spots have become Middle-Aged British Artists, and the area has grown up too. Now, young artists, galleries and nighttime scenes are popping up in nearby cheaper spots, including Bethnal Green, a mile east of Hoxton and three miles northeast of the city center.\nHome to factories, cholera and filth during Britain's industrial revolution, site of a Jack the Ripper murder, and bombed during World War II, Bethnal Green now has a growing gallery scene. A string of art spaces are clustered on Vyner Street in Bethnal Green, south of the Regent's Canal.\nAt 7A and 10 Vyner Street, Modern Art, (44-20) 8980-7742, www.modernartinc.com, recently showed Nigel Cooke's apocalyptic, intricate landscapes. Fred, at 45 Vyner Street, (44-20) 8981-2987, www.fred-london.com, exhibited Guy Richard Smit's video installation and watercolors, and invited visitors to see Smit's band in a nearby venue. The band was outplayed by Bethnal Green locals, the Main Ones. Also on the block is Vilma Gold, at 25B Vyner Street, (44-20) 8981-3344, www.vilmagold.com.\nThe Cell Project Space, (44-20) 7241-3600, www.cell.org.uk, which provides cheap studio space for visual artists around the corner at 258 Cambridge Heath Road, ran a recent exhibition on four-leaf clovers by Yoke and Zoom. The Ibid Projects, which focuses on new Baltic and British artists, is nearby at 210 Cambridge Heath Road, (44-20) 8983-4355, www.ibidprojects.com. Maureen Paley, a pioneer east-end gallery owner who has lived in Bethnal Green since the 80's, is at 21 Herald Street; (44-20) 7729-4112.\nFor information, visit www.artupdate.com, www.art-shopper.com or www.artmonthly.co.uk. The Contemporary Art Society's group, (44-20) 7612-0730, www.bloodarts.org, runs occasional tours to the area.\nThe neighborhood mixes heartbreakingly ugly concrete buildings with intricate Victorian brick affairs. It also provides a good glimpse of East London's varied population. Women in full black robes and headscarves wait for the bus next to teenage girls in sprayed-on jeans and tube tops. You can find tapas on Columbia Road, and Bangladeshi food or bagels on Brick Lane.\nVyner Street can be reached by a short walk along the canal from Broadway Market, a low-key pub- and restaurant-lined street with a Saturday farmers' market.\nBethnal Green's nighttime scene consists mainly of classic pubs with laid-back crowds. At the Florist, 255 Globe Road, (44-20) 8981-1100, casually dressed young crowds quaff pints, with Rottweiler puppies in tow. The Approach Tavern, 47 Approach Road, (44-20) 8980-2321, is decorated with stuffed birds and ancient bric-a-brac.\nSlick newer spots are popping up too: Bistrotheque, 23-27 Wadeson Street, (44-20) 8983-7900, a former clothing factory, serves bistro classics and has a bar/cabaret space downstairs.\nPossibly the best thing about Bethnal Green at night is the Bethnal Green Working Men's Club, (44-20) 7739-2727. Tucked off Bethnal Green Road, at 42 Pollard Row, the building, circa 1895, now offers a loose schedule of D.J.'s, bands, theme nights, self-described \"polysexual\" parties and the occasional cabaret. On one visit the young crowd was elegantly dressed in clothing from the 1940's. Another night, the dress was modern, but the D.J.'s successfully mixed the Cure with Perry Como's \"Papa Loves Mambo.\" The cheerfully sloshed bartender could have been a Cockney wench from another era as she served up gin, no matter what you ordered. If you want fancy drinks, you can go to Hoxton.",

    "text": "Islam can vote, if we let it\n2005-05-24T05:00:00.000Z\n\nCAIRO \u2014 In last month's Saudi Arabian municipal elections, the nation's first experiment in real democracy, many were worried because Islamic activists dominated their secular rivals.\nIndeed, we have seen a similar trend in Turkey, Morocco and Iraq in the last few years; and we can expect it in the coming Lebanese, Palestinian and Egyptian elections. Yet, while this Islamic trend can no longer be ignored, neither should it be a source of panic to Western policy makers and pundits.\nBased on my 30 years of empirical investigation into these parties - including my observations of fellow inmates during the 14 months I spent in an Egyptian prison - I can testify to a significant evolution on the part of political Islam. In fact, I believe we may be witnessing the emergence of Muslim parties that are truly democratic, akin to the Christian Democrats in Western Europe after World War II.\nTo understand this evolution, one must look at how the Islamists rose to such prominence. Autocratic regimes in the Middle East have for decades allowed little public space to those who would build civil societies; no freedom of speech, assembly or association.\nThe only space for people to congregate without harassment by the secret police was the mosque. Thus, unwittingly, the autocrats contributed to the growth of the theocrats, who became their mirror images.\nTaking advantage of the rulers' economic and political failures at home and their setbacks on battlefields, the theocrats made compelling cases for their own visions. And through their great efforts in providing services to the poor, they evolved first into de facto social workers and then into local politicians, eventually taking control of cities like Algiers and Oran in Algeria, and Istanbul and Ankara in Turkey.\nSeen as efficient and uncorrupt, these Islamists began to gain in popularity even among secularists and won parliamentary pluralities in Algeria in 1991 and in Turkey 11 years later. (In Algeria the Islamists were not allowed to enjoy the fruits of their victory, thanks to a Western-condoned military coup.)\nToday, two-thirds of the estimated 1.4 billion Muslims in the world live under democratically elected governments in which Islamists are major players - with Indonesia, Bangladesh and Morocco joining Turkey as bright spots.\nClearly, on grounds of principle and pragmatism, Westerners should not be dismayed at the thought of allowing religious parties a role in the emerging political structures of the Arab world.\nFor one thing, as citizens, Islamists are entitled to the same basic rights as others. It would therefore be hypocritical to call for democracy in these countries and at the same time to deny any groups wanting to peacefully contend for office.\nSecond, Islamists tend to be fairly well organized and popular. Yes, some have created armed wings to their movements, ostensibly to resist foreign occupation (Hezbollah in Lebanon, Islamic Jihad in Palestine) or in response to authoritarian regimes.\nBut in all cases, a moderate, less-violent Islamist core exists. Excluding the religious parties from the political mainstream risks giving the upper hand to the armed factions at the expense of their more moderate centers.\nRepression has had high costs. Where Islamist groups are denied access to political space, their cause takes on an aura of mythical martyrdom, and their abstract calls for a return to Islamic principles of governance are not put to the test.\nA phrase like \"the meek are the inheritors of the earth\" resonates with the masses, though it is empty of any practical content. As long as these groups don't have to deal with the complicated business of forging actual political policies, their popularity remains untested.\nThe challenge, therefore, is to find a formula that includes them in the system, but that prevents a \"one man, one vote, one time\" situation.\nOne fairly successful attempt at such a formula was coordinated by King Hussein of Jordan, after widespread riots in 1989 over food shortages in his traditional stronghold in the south. Needing to engage the people more directly in the tough economic decisions that had to be made, he opted for a constitutional monarchy.\nHe brought all of Jordan's political forces together in a national congress, in which the rules of the democratic game were enshrined in a national charter. The Islamists signed on.\n 1 \n2\nNext Page \u00bb\n",

    "text": "Japanese Home Cooking, Full of Surprises\n2005-11-02T05:00:00.000Z\nCURRY ROW is well on its way to becoming a memory.\nEast Sixth Street between First and Second Avenues, once a unified front of mostly undistinguished Bangladeshi and Indian restaurants, now serves up Peruvian, Cajun, Italian-American, Ethiopian and two kinds of Japanese restaurants. Only 11 of the 19 restaurants there serve Subcontinental cuisine.\nChiyono (chee-OH-no) is one of the restaurants that has broken curry's hold on the block. It serves a menu that is representative of contemporary Japanese home cooking -- croquettes, potato salad and the like -- interspersed with dishes Chiyono Murano, the chatty chef and owner, has created herself.\nDishes like a special of gorgonzola with vegetables ($7.50), which sounds like it would be a good bet in an Italian restaurant but a disaster coming out of a Japanese kitchen. Fear not. Ms. Murano dressed pieces of boiled and chilled burdock root, lotus root and Japanese sweet potato -- sweeter than the standard American sweet potato -- in a diluted, almost mild, creamy blue cheese sauce. The combination was odd but delicious.\nIt also illustrates a principle that characterizes most dishes at Chiyono: reserve. Ms. Murano does not serve brashly flavored food. The bold flavors of ingredients like gorgonzola were reined in, and seasonings like soy sauce were used sparingly but effectively.\nThis was evident in the ume rice ($2.50), an off-the-menu item that is part of the five-course prix fix menu ($25 to $30; includes one drink) that the restaurant serves nightly. It is simple: perfectly cooked short-grain rice tossed with tiny amounts of intensely flavorful shredded shiso leaves and minced umeboshi, preserved plums that Ms. Murano's mother grows and pickles in Iwaki, Japan. The flavors drew me in like whispers, demanding my attention, and turned a bowl of rice into a dish that pulled me back to the restaurant twice in one week.\nMs. Murano made a large and straightforward salad of avocado and mixed greens her own ($8.50) with seaweed, mitsuba (a celery-like herb) and dressing spiked with a pinch of wasabi that adds sparkle, not spice. Soba salad ($8.50) was less assuredly seasoned -- bland, in other words -- though the soba noodles were perfectly cooked.\nOther than forgettable dashimaki tamago, a rolled, chilled omelet ($5.50), appetizers were uniformly reliable. The healthy helping of sweet, soy-braised pork belly, kakuni ($6.50) was particularly good with a bowl of ume rice and a beer; for sake sipping and light supping start with the boiled lotus root dressed with pickled plums and shiso ($4.25).\nSoups were worthy of exploration. A burdock and potato pur\u00e9e ($4.50), highlights the earthy flavor and unusual, slightly gooey texture of burdock root in a compelling way. A simple miso soup served with quenelles of light sardine mousse ($4.50) was best for those who enjoy the strong flavor of oily fish.\nThe best entrees are broiled or fried. Like flawless fried chicken ($7.95) with vinegary cabbage slaw as a foil or menchi katsu ($8.50), fried patties of pork and vegetables that evoke nothing so much as fried Japanese-style meatloaf. A few main courses come with potato salad ($4.50), a dish Japanese cooks have adopted and made their own, that can be ordered on the side as well. It was dotted with plump golden raisins, and inexplicably good.\nOne night there was a special of salmon collar ($8.50) on the chalkboard menu that almost counts as d\u00e9cor in the minimally appointed room that is dominated by a massive 18-seat communal table. It turned out to be half a salmon's head, broiled, and, in its simplicity, one of the best things we had on any visit to Chiyono, much better than the dryish salmon filet on the set menu.\nThat wasn't lost on Ms. Murano or her small staff. That night, during the tableside chat that ended every meal at the restaurant, Ms. Murano confided to us that the cooks had been hoping no one would order the salmon collar so they could have it for a staff meal at the end of the night. Looking down at the plate -- gills and an eyeball were just about all that was left -- she observed that we must really like Japanese food.\nWe do, we assured her. And later we marveled at her decision to open a haven of homestyle Japanese cooking -- a largely untested proposition -- on Sixth Street of all places. There goes the neighborhood, we figured, and for the better.\nChiyono 328 East Sixth Street, East Village; (212) 673-3984.\nBEST DISHES -- Lotus root with pickled plum and shiso; pork belly simmered in soy sauce; burdock root and potato soup; avocado salad; potato salad; fried chicken; pork and vegetable croquettes; ume rice.\nPRICE RANGE -- Soups, appetizers and salads, $2.50 to $8.50; entrees, $7.50 to $11.50; desserts $3.75 to $4.50.\nCREDIT CARDS -- MasterCard and Visa.\nHOURS -- Tuesday through Saturday, 6 p.m. to 11:30 p.m.; Sunday, 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. Closed Monday.\nWHEELCHAIR ACCESS -- One step at entrance.

    "text": "Philip Bowring: Look who's coming to Davos\n2005-01-27T05:00:00.000Z\n\nDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 It is late January. There are mountains and snow. It must be Davos.\nThe annual meeting of the World Economic Forum is a fixture in that calendar where news and socializing meet, where the great, the good and the not so good mix with each other and the media. It certainly beats events like the World Bank/IMF annual meeting with its overload of bankers and economists. Here there are scientists and artists as well as familiar politicians and business figures. This year there is also extra snow, and Tony Blair and Jacques Chirac are at the top of the bill. But is that why we come?\nAs a visitor for 10 of the past 15 years, the event has singular attractions for me. The prospect of meeting up with scattered friends and old colleagues has a pull all of its own. Many of the same people attend year in year out, which is comforting. The food is good, the organization superb, and there are no big city distractions from socializing.\nBut as one who must be counted as a Davos loyalist, I must say, the \"World\" in World Economic Forum has become something of a misnomer. That in turn raises the question of why the event continues to receive almost blanket news coverage for mostly unexceptional speeches and interviews.\nThe warped nature of the Davos globe is illustrated by a quick count of the country-of-residence of the 500 or so individuals who are speaking or moderating this week. The United States accounts for 40 percent; Britain, 15 percent; and the rest of Europe, 20 percent. Add in a few others, like Australia, and nearly 80 percent are from the Western, developed world.\nSouth Africa gets a respectable showing, as does the Arab world. But the rest of Africa is barely represented, and, despite the appearance of President Luiz Ina\u0301cio Lula da Silva, Brazil makes little mark. As for Asia, the feeble representation of dynamic Korea, rich Japan, inventive Taiwan, fast-growing China and India, and the Asean 10 big trading nations is remarkable. The 300 million democratic Muslims of Indonesia and Bangladesh barely exist for the Davos world of 2005.\nOf the 2,000 or so participants, only some 450 are from the non-Western world, as are only 10 of 80 corporate \"partners,\" or sponsors. There is just one such partner from dynamic east Asia. There is Nestle\u0301 and Coca Cola, Volkswagen and Siemens, Goldman Sachs, Merck and Microsoft. But no Toyota or Canon, Samsung, Toshiba, Hutchison, LG or Acer.\nThe decline in Asia's presence from a few years ago is particularly striking at a time when its role in the global economy has become so large. The most senior Asian politicians on the list are two No. 2's from Pakistan and Malaysia. Even more striking is the low level of participation from technology leaders from Korea, Japan and Taiwan, or of the heads of Asian global brand names.\nA decline in the willingness of Asian companies and governments to spend the large sums required to participate reflects a sense that the event is too dominated by Western political, corporate and intellectual interests to be worth attending.\nThe decline has become self-reinforcing. It cannot be blamed on China's attempt to establish a rival and specifically Asian equivalent, the Boao Forum for Asia held in Hainan in April, which suffers from being Beijing-sponsored. Nor does the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, Brazil, present direct competition other than for NGOs.\nPoorer nations and individuals from them often find the cost of attending Davos too steep. Despite its self-description as \"Committed to Improving the State of the World,\" the WEF is not a charity. You get what you pay for.\nDavos's promotion of globalization could be much better served by its signature event. Its composition does not reflect the political, commercial, industrial or intellectual worlds of the present, let alone the future. Indeed, critics would argue that the composition reflects the arrogance and complacence of the West in the face of its rapid relative decline.

    "text": "Look who's coming to Davos\n2005-01-27T05:00:00.000Z\n\nDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 It is late January. There are mountains and snow. It must be Davos.\nThe annual meeting of the World Economic Forum is a fixture in that calendar where news and socializing meet, where the great, the good and the not so good mix with each other and the media. It certainly beats events like the World Bank/IMF annual meeting with its overload of bankers and economists. Here there are scientists and artists as well as familiar politicians and business figures. This year there is also extra snow, and Tony Blair and Jacques Chirac are at the top of the bill. But is that why we come?\nAs a visitor for 10 of the past 15 years, the event has singular attractions for me. The prospect of meeting up with scattered friends and old colleagues has a pull all of its own. Many of the same people attend year in year out, which is comforting. The food is good, the organization superb, and there are no big city distractions from socializing.\nBut as one who must be counted as a Davos loyalist, I must say, the \"World\" in World Economic Forum has become something of a misnomer. That in turn raises the question of why the event continues to receive almost blanket news coverage for mostly unexceptional speeches and interviews.\nThe warped nature of the Davos globe is illustrated by a quick count of the country-of-residence of the 500 or so individuals who are speaking or moderating this week. The United States accounts for 40 percent; Britain, 15 percent; and the rest of Europe, 20 percent. Add in a few others, like Australia, and nearly 80 percent are from the Western, developed world.\nSouth Africa gets a respectable showing, as does the Arab world. But the rest of Africa is barely represented, and, despite the appearance of President Luiz Ina\u0301cio Lula da Silva, Brazil makes little mark. As for Asia, the feeble representation of dynamic Korea, rich Japan, inventive Taiwan, fast-growing China and India, and the Asean 10 big trading nations is remarkable. The 300 million democratic Muslims of Indonesia and Bangladesh barely exist for the Davos world of 2005.\nOf the 2,000 or so participants, only some 450 are from the non-Western world, as are only 10 of 80 corporate \"partners,\" or sponsors. There is just one such partner from dynamic east Asia. There is Nestle\u0301 and Coca Cola, Volkswagen and Siemens, Goldman Sachs, Merck and Microsoft. But no Toyota or Canon, Samsung, Toshiba, Hutchison, LG or Acer.\nThe decline in Asia's presence from a few years ago is particularly striking at a time when its role in the global economy has become so large. The most senior Asian politicians on the list are two No. 2's from Pakistan and Malaysia. Even more striking is the low level of participation from technology leaders from Korea, Japan and Taiwan, or of the heads of Asian global brand names.\nA decline in the willingness of Asian companies and governments to spend the large sums required to participate reflects a sense that the event is too dominated by Western political, corporate and intellectual interests to be worth attending.\nThe decline has become self-reinforcing. It cannot be blamed on China's attempt to establish a rival and specifically Asian equivalent, the Boao Forum for Asia held in Hainan in April, which suffers from being Beijing-sponsored. Nor does the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, Brazil, present direct competition other than for NGOs.\nPoorer nations and individuals from them often find the cost of attending Davos too steep. Despite its self-description as \"Committed to Improving the State of the World,\" the WEF is not a charity. You get what you pay for.\nDavos's promotion of globalization could be much better served by its signature event. Its composition does not reflect the political, commercial, industrial or intellectual worlds of the present, let alone the future. Indeed, critics would argue that the composition reflects the arrogance and complacence of the West in the face of its rapid relative decline. That's a pity, because Davos does have the framework and the status.\nBut for all its faults, Davos is still fun, especially for skiers now that there's all that snow.\n*\n[Not to be reproduced without the permission of the author.]\n",

    "text": "From the Wheel to the Treadmill\n2005-12-28T05:00:00.000Z\nIt's no mystery why the old-time hacks used to call their yellow cabs a heart attack on wheels.\nTry sitting for 12 hours at a stretch while navigating a traffic-choked, potholed city populated by jaywalking pedestrians, traffic police and kamikaze drivers -- many of them fellow cabbies. Add a steady dose of stinging insults and haughty demands from backseat drivers. Top off the day with a profusion of fried food and sugared coffee, and it makes sense that cabbies suffer from soaring rates of high blood pressure, diabetes, lower back pain and shredded nerves.\n\"I know so many drivers with big bellies,\" said Shahzad Butt, a 13-year veteran of the road. \"They all carry medicine around in their pocket.\"\nBut when fares grow more scarce after midnight, he and about 100 other cabbies head to a 24-hour health club in Queens, where a brightly illuminated awning taunts and beckons drivers along on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. The gym, BQE Fitness Complex overlooking Exit 40 in Woodside, has become something of a service station for broken and bedraggled cabbies whose white-knuckle jobs leave them tightly wound, their bodies and souls aching.\nBy 2 a.m., the gym's parking lot and surrounding streets are awash in yellow vehicles whose drivers have ended their shifts early. Mohammed Raju Ahmad, a 45-year-old Bangladeshi, is an effusive convert to the American-style passion for physical fitness, having yielded to the relentless prodding of his wife. Once a roly-poly 190 pounds, Mr. Ahmad has shed more than 20 pounds since joining the gym last year. His goal, he said, is to drop another seven or eight.\n\"My whole body had become all fat,\" said Mr. Ahmad, a squat, cheery man, as he power-walked on a treadmill. \"When you sit for 12 hours, your blood stops flowing.\"\nAlthough Mr. Ahmad's body image has been bolstered by his new regimen, part of which includes a diet low in rice and greasy unleavened bread, he says that the public also benefits from the hour or so he spends at the gym four nights a week.\n\"When health is good, mind is good,\" he said, his shirt turning soggy. \"When mind is good, passenger feels good because I don't lose my temper so much.\"\nGuillermo Messier, the club's night manager, said BQE Fitness has benefited from the 2,000 or so members who drive yellow taxis, livery cabs or limousines. \"We couldn't stay open all night if it weren't for these guys,\" said Mr. Messier, a Colombian who has mastered a handful of brief exchanges in Punjabi, Bengali, Hindi and Urdu, the lingua francas of most overnight members.\nEthnic and religious differences largely melt away in the weight room, where drivers horse around or spot one another while lifting. Zulfeqar Ahmad, a 47-year-old Pakistani who was a college power lifter and a police officer, said he and his South Asian brethren enforced a ban on discussing politics. \"Here, we are all brothers,\" he said, his arm draped across the shoulder of a beefy Punjabi driver from the other side of the Pakistani-Indian border. \"If someone tries to talk politics, I tell them to stop. I am very strict.\"\nIn recent months, the membership collected $5,000 among themselves for the victims of the Pakistani earthquake.\nThe gym, which opened in 1978 as a tennis and racquetball club, draws a working-class crowd from Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx. (Fourteen of the club's 20 racquetball courts have since been converted into weight rooms, aerobic salons and indoor soccer fields). Largely Latino during the day, the place is taken over by drivers in the wee hours, nearly all of whom dash out around 4 a.m. so they can return their leased vehicles by 5 a.m., the end of the industry's 12-hour shift. After a brief lull, the gym perks up around 5 a.m. with elderly Greek men from nearby Astoria, followed by postal workers, police officers and bus drivers who finish their workouts as the sun is peering over the expressway that roars in front of the gym's entrance.\nAlthough there are a score of other 24-hour gyms across the city, BQE Fitness has become especially popular among drivers lured by generous parking, easy highway access and membership fees that can be as low as $125 a year. Because they start off their shifts in the red, owing gas money and lease fees, many cabbies will not go to the club unless they have a decent amount of money in their pocket.\nThe decision to put livelihood over health takes its toll on many drivers, who suffer from a disproportionate array of job-related infirmities, said Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance. \"The financial stresses, physical constraints and potential dangers produce all kinds of long-term illnesses,\" she said, adding that 80 percent of cabbies lack health insurance. She also cited a Department of Labor survey, released in 2000, which found that taxi drivers are 60 times more likely to be killed on the job than those in other professions, including police officers and firefighters. Adding to the stress, she said, is the fact that drivers get no paid vacations or sick leave, even when they are hospitalized after an accident.\n\"It's really heartbreaking because these are such beautiful people who work so hard and so honestly to take care of their families and the end result is such an assault their dignity and their bodies,\" she said.\nWhile improved fitness is often the lure, many drivers cherish their time at the gym as an opportunity for uninterrupted socializing. Take Jaswinder Singh and his two friends Gursewak and Daljinder, both of whom are Punjabi Sikhs and share the Singh surname. Four nights a week, just after midnight, they switch on their off-duty lights and head to Woodside, where they spend the night hovering around the machines, teasing one another and sharing stories about nettlesome passengers, overzealous police officers and near-miss accidents. Because they are in their mid-20's and still single, the conversation invariably returns to the looming prospect of arranged marriages that their families are planning.\n\"This is the only place we can come together and freely talk about our lives,\" said Jaswinder, 23, the youngest of the three. \"We realize we won't be single for much longer. Maybe after we marry, we won't have time for this.\"\nAlthough the men are in decent shape, the three hours they spend at the gym each night are not exactly reflected in their lanky bodies. Asked why they are not more buff, Gursewak, 26, grinned, then made a confession: \"That's because we probably spend more time talking than working out.\"",

    "text": "Mourning Mother Russia\n2005-04-28T05:00:00.000Z\nVladimir Putin gave a bizarre speech this week in which he described the fall of the Soviet Union as \"the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century\" and said that an \"epidemic of collapse has spilled over to Russia itself.\"\nThe sad thing is he is half right.\nMost of us are grateful for the fall of communism, but the phrase \"epidemic of collapse\" is not a bad description of what Russian society is suffering through right now. You can measure that collapse most broadly in the country's phenomenal population decline. According to U.N. projections, Russia's population will plummet from about 146 million in 2000 to about 104 million in 2050. Russia will go from being the 6th-most-populous country in the world to being the 17th.\nThat population decline has a number of causes. The first is the crisis in the Russian family and the decline in fertility rates. Between 1981 and 2001, marriage rates in Russia dropped by a third, and divorce rates rose by a third, according to Russian government estimates. As Nicholas Eberstadt of the American Enterprise Institute pointed out recently in one of the last issues of The Public Interest, Russia now has three divorces for every four marriages, an astounding rate of family breakups.\nAs the Soviet regime disintegrated, Russian fertility rates fell through the floor, from 2.19 births per woman in 1986-87 to 1.17 in 1999. Birth rates have now recovered somewhat, but they are not even close to replacement levels. According to Eberstadt, Russia currently has about 160 deaths for every 100 births.\nThe more shocking reason Russia's population is declining is that people are dying younger. Russians are now much less healthy than their grandparents were in 1960. In the past three decades, Russian mortality rates have risen by 40 percent. Russian life expectancies now approximate those in Bangladesh and are below India's.\nThe health care system is in shambles. The risk of suffering a violent death is nine times as high for Russian men, compared with men in Israel. There's an explosion of heart attacks and strokes, thanks to smoking, increased vodka consumption and other ruinous lifestyle choices. The H.I.V./AIDS epidemic hasn't even been fully factored into the official statistics. According to Russian statistics, a 20-year-old man in 2000 had only a 46 percent chance of reaching age 65. (American 20-year-olds had about an 80 percent chance.)\nWhat we are seeing, in short, is a country with nuclear weapons that is enduring a slow-motion version of the medieval Black Death. Perhaps we should be thankful that the political and economic situation there isn't worse than it is.\nFor, indeed, the paradox of Russia is that as life has become miserable in many ways, the economy has grown at an impressive clip. We can look back on this and begin to see a pattern that might be called Post-Totalitarian Stress Syndrome.\nWhen totalitarian regimes take control of a country, they destroy the bonds of civic trust and the normal patterns of social cohesion. They rule by fear, and public life becomes brutish. They pervert private and public morality.\nWhen those totalitarian regimes fall, different parts of society recover at different rates. Some enterprising people take advantage of economic recovery, and the result of their efforts is economic growth.\nBut private morality, the habits of self-control and the social fabric take a lot longer to recover. So you wind up with nations in which high growth rates and lingering military power mask profound social chaos.\nThis is what we're seeing in Russia. It's probably what we would be seeing in Iraq even if the insurgency were under control. And most frighteningly, it could be what we will be seeing in China for decades to come.\nOn the surface, China looks much more impressive than Russia. But this is a country that will be living with the consequences of totalitarianism for some time. Thanks to the one-child policy, there will be hundreds of millions of elderly people without families to support them. Thanks to that same policy, and the cultural predilection for boys, there will be tens of millions of surplus single men floating around with no marital prospects, no civilizing influences, nothing to prevent them from assembling into violent criminal bands.\nAt some point the power-hungry find a way to exploit social misery. At some point internal social chaos has international consequences. Fasten your seat belts. We could be in for a bumpy ride.\nOp-Ed Columnist E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com",

Planes normally treat the limit flexibly when they taxi, in order to keep traffic flowing more smoothly.\nAsiana Airlines pilots are planning to walk off for 24 hours beginning at 1:00 a.m. (1600 GMT) Tuesday, which means that Asiana planes will be grounded for that period at Seoul's domestic and international airports.\nWASHINGTON\nA recent uptick in flight delays at major U.S. airports may signal the start of summer-long travel disruptions, a government watchdog has said.\nThe warning from the Transportation Department Inspector General's office came as millions of travelers took advantage of low fares and plentiful flights for trips over the long Fourth of July holiday.\nU.S. airlines expect to fly more than 200 million passengers from May through the first week in September, a 4 percent increase over last year.\nAirline delays are usually worse in summer because of thunderstorms. FAA forecasters are predicting a heavy storm season and storms were bad in the Midwest in early June.\nPRAGUE\nVisitor numbers to the Czech Republic may be at record levels but tourist chiefs insist more must be done to stamp out rip-off taxis, poor signposting and a lack of public facilities and to improve infrastructure.\nLocal Development Minister Radko Martinek said the visitor experience had to be enhanced, with announcements on public transport and signposting for major attractions in English and other languages, better controls on taxis, clearer rules for rates in exchange offices, and more public toilets.\nThe Czech Republic attracted a record 7.9 million foreign tourists last year, 19.4 percent more than in 2003, largely thanks to the soaring popularity of low-cost airlines.\nKIEV\nHundreds of vendors protested at the start of the weekend against a new rule that limits sales in Kiev's subway systems. The Kiev City Council's prohibition on sales from vendors who pack and unpack their goods daily, which came into effect Friday, would cost about 3,000 vendors their jobs hawking newspapers, flowers, souvenirs, food, cigarettes and cosmetics from small tables, said Vitaliy Shelapov, head of the subway entrepreneurs trade union.\nNEW DELHI:The escalators proved as much a novelty as the hi-tech underground trains Sunday as tens of thousands of joy-riders crammed Delhi's new metro line connecting key transport hubs with the main business district.Though it officially opened on Saturday, the public had to wait a day before being allowed on the 6.3 kilometre (3.8 mile) \"yellow line\" linking the upmarket Central Secretariat government area with the teeming bazaars and narrow alleyways of Old Delhi.\nThis week's holidays\nBanking and government offices may be closed or services curtailed in these countries and their dependencies for national or religious holidays:\nMonday: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia, Guyana, United States, Zambia.\nTuesday: Algeria, Armenia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Venezuela, Zambia.\nWednesday: Czech Republic, Lithuania, Malawi.\nThursday: Bangladesh, Nepal, Serbia, Tanzania.\nSaturday: Argentina.\nSunday: Bahamas, Mauritania.\n",

    "text": "In American Cities, No Mirror Image of Muslims of Leeds\n2005-07-21T05:00:00.000Z\nAfter the four suicide bombers in London were identified last week, news accounts focused on life in the old mill town of Leeds, where they grew up: the immigrant enclaves, the high unemployment, the rising anger and alienation of Muslim residents. Some Britons grasping for an explanation pointed at those conditions, however tentative their link to homegrown terrorism.\nThat rough sketch of Leeds had a familiar ring for many residents of the Northeastern United States, where old mill towns in New Jersey and upstate New York have also drawn many immigrants to faded neighborhoods teetering between blight and renewal.\nThree of the suspects were raised in immigrant families from Pakistan and one from Jamaica. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are now home to at least 20 percent of the nation's 219,000 Pakistani immigrants, and more than half of the 513,000 immigrants from Jamaica.\nBut the differences between the suspects' hometown and the depressed cities around New York are actually stronger than the similarities. Social conditions among British immigrants, for example, appear to be considerably worse than they are in the United States.\nThe 747,000 Pakistanis in Britain, counted among its nonwhite residents, are three times more likely to be out of work than white Britons, according to one of several bleak statistics showcased in the 2001 British census. Forty percent of Pakistani women and 28 percent of Pakistani men are listed as having no job qualifications, and school failure among Caribbean blacks is triple the rate for white Britons, who constitute 92 percent of the population.\nIn America, where few surveys even break out ethnic origins, a much rosier picture emerges from available figures. Pakistani household incomes in New York are close to the $43,393 median and exceed it in New Jersey -- $56,566 compared with $55,145, according to 1999 figures, the most recent available. Jamaicans fare a little less well statewide, but have robust rates of household income and educational success in New York City, where they are concentrated. They have a clear edge: English proficiency in a place where one in four residents cannot speak it well, and where nearly half of the work force is foreign-born.\nWhile South Asian immigrants to Britain began arriving soon after World War II, they were part of a stream of temporary workers to a small, culturally homogenous country where they remained outsiders. In the United States, the pioneer immigrants from predominantly Muslim lands arrived mainly after 1980, many as university students, and like Caribbean blacks, entered a diverse country built on immigration.\nBut demographics fall short of explaining terrorism. As details emerged about the British suspects' relatively prosperous lives, experts and immigrant parents alike wondered how much collective benchmarks mean in predicting the extremism of a handful of angry people.\nCompared with Britain, \"We definitely have a different dynamic going on here in the United States,\" said Peter Skerry, a political scientist at Boston College. \"I don't know that that necessarily means we're out of the woods -- it doesn't take very much for a set of individuals to adopt attitudes that could lead to a terrorist act.\"\nOthers, like Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center of Immigration Studies, which favors more restriction on immigration, point out that this important demographic difference is temporary: Since most immigrants to the United States from Muslim countries arrived after 1990, few of the children born to them here have reached adulthood yet. He found that more than 85 percent of the 100,000 children born in America to Pakistanis and Bangladeshis are under 20.\nIn a Jersey City shop where fresh goat meat and comic videos in Urdu compete for shelf space, Zafar Zafar, a Pakistani father of three, echoed such concerns last week. Mr. Zafar, whose oldest child is 13, struggled in imperfect English to convey his horror at the case of Shahzad Tanweer, 22, the suspect described as a pious but fun-loving youth whose father owned a fish-and-chips shop in Leeds.\n\"It's like a bad dream,\" Mr. Zafar said. \"Someone, crazy guys, make brainwashing.\" He added, \"We need protection. Like, every week, two times a week, all youngsters in community should go together, and someone is teaching them, 'This should no happen again.\"'\nSo far, there is little research and less agreement on how well Muslim newcomers are assimilating as Americans, say scholars like Mr. Skerry, who is associated with the Brookings Institute, and Robert S. Leiken, the director of Immigration and National Security at the Nixon Center.\n\"The whole issue of assimilation and integration in relation to terrorism is extremely complicated,\" Mr. Leiken cautioned, noting that more terrorists have turned out to be social winners from an educated middle class, rather than impoverished losers. \"Integration may be going well, but there are people who assimilate as critics, as revolutionaries.\"\nThere is general agreement, he said, that since 9/11, larger numbers of young Muslims in the United States feel victimized, resentful and alienated, but that is where the consensus ends. \"Some people hold that Muslims are integrating in just the same ways that other American immigrants have integrated,\" he said. \"Others see a process of radical Islamicization.\"\nOnce children born to Pakistani, Egyptian or Iraqi immigrants might simply have found a dual identity in a hyphenated bridge to their parents' national origins. But Mr. Skerry, who has been interviewing such immigrants across the country, said events since 9/11 -- special registration programs, the Patriot Act and the war in Iraq -- almost require even secular families in this second generation to construct an American identity as Muslims.\nPartha Banerjee, director of the New Jersey Immigration Policy Network, an immigrant advocacy organization, warned of a growing sense of political exclusion among such immigrants, who are facing an anti-immigrant backlash with virtually no elected officials from their own ethnic group.\nIncome statistics in New Jersey hide sharp disparities, he noted, like the chasm between suburban sahibs in places like Somerset, the nation's most affluent county, and poor Pakistanis and Bangladeshis in crowded Jersey City households.\n\"Violence and terrorism really have no place in a civilized society and I'm not condoning any type of excuse for it,\" Mr. Banerjee stressed. \"But the fact remains that if you just exploit and abuse people without giving them their rights, you run the risk of creating a danger in your own society.\"\nIn Jersey City, where more than a third of residents are foreign-born, there are no hard-edge ethnic enclaves. A policeman pointed out the second-floor mosque where Omar Abdul Rahman, the blind sheik, used to preach and plot to blow up New York landmarks; it sits over a Chinese takeout restaurant now.\nA short walk from Mr. Zafar's shop on Newark Avenue on a recent Friday morning, Haitian families in starched finery entered an old movie palace for a convention of Jehovah's Witnesses. At the beauty parlor nearby, everyone was speaking Spanish. And down the block, Indian, Pakistani and Chinese immigrants of different faiths flocked to Patel's Cash and Carry for sacks of rice advertised in an all-American way: \"Buy two, get one free.\"\nFauazia Modak, 26, a Muslim immigrant from Bombay, paused in her shopping to protest what she said were harsh government immigration policies that seemed to blame all Muslims for the crimes of a few. Then she smiled at her son Mizan, just under 2.\n\"I don't think the children over here would be brainwashed,\" she said, leaning over his stroller. \"I want him to be religious, but I want him to respect all religions. Not just his religion, not just his country.\"",

    "text": "Multiethnic Milan's coming of age\n2005-09-30T05:00:00.000Z\n\nMILAN \u2014 The proud father pulls a cellphone out of his pocket, flips it open and shows a visitor a digital photo of two boys standing in a park wearing the red and black jerseys of one of Milan's soccer teams.\n\"These are my kids, they are 10 and five,\" beams Rafael Falen Oliden, a Peruvian who has been living in this city for more than a decade and for most of that time has owned a shop that offers a variety of services including money transfers, cheap phone calls and Internet access. \"They are the Italians of the future. Their kids, my grandchildren, even more so.\"\nThis city has always been something of an anomaly, home to some of the world's best-known fashion companies, such as Prada and Armani, yet so provincial that not long ago even the most trained eye would not have found a cinema with films in English, a Thai restaurant or non-European kids playing in the parks. The periodic invasion of foreigners for the fashion shows did little to tilt Milan toward multiculturalism.\nThat has changed in the past five years and the city of high fashion is making a timid move to becoming a European multiethnic metropolis. And while it will surely not compete as far as diversity with the likes of London and Paris for decades and maybe never, a mammoth shift is in progress in Italy's second-biggest city.\nMulticultural has never been an adjective linked to Italy and what little diversity there was in the country a decade ago was reserved for Rome, home to embassies and the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. The waves of immigration in recent years pale in comparison to the number of Italians who left the country beginning in the 19th century and into the 1950s, but it has been enough to reshape Italian society.\nItaly had 144,000 regularly documented foreigners in 1970 and 2.4 million at the end of last year, according to Caritas, a charity that works to help immigrants. The number has risen every year since 1992, when 649,000 foreigners lived in Italy. Added to the current numbers of legal immigrants is a mass of undocumented foreigners, which by most estimates exceeds one million.\nBut being multiethnic does not only mean having kabob stands, Indian takeaway and movies in original languages. In Milan it has translated into the introduction in 2001 of two undergraduate degree programs entirely in English at the local Bocconi University. Egyptians run construction companies. Weekly magazines are published by and for foreigners, and a housing market is kept buoyant by acquisitive non-Europeans and people like Falen working tirelessly to expand their businesses.\n\"The idea was born soon after I got here and the aim was to offer services to people from Peru,\" said Falen, impeccably dressed with a pinstriped suit, pressed white shirt and orange tie. \"But we soon learned we can cater to all Latin Americans and we can also attract Italian clientele with traditional clothing and crafts from South America.\"\nThe store also sells Peruvian foods and drinks - including packaged fried bananas and the country's famous Inca Kola - as well as some perishable goods like fresh hot peppers and Peruvian potatoes. However, as Milan shifts with the times, Falen, who employees five Peruvians, is no longer the exception in the business world.\nAt the end of last year there were almost 10,000 companies in Milan run by non-European Union citizens, according to the city's Chamber of Commerce. That was a 20 percent increase compared with the year before and though many of the companies are small and employ just a few people, the number has grown every year since 2000.\nEgyptians have the most companies in Milan, more than 2,000, followed by Chinese, Moroccans, Peruvians and Bangladeshis. More than 100 countries are represented.\n\"When I started 12 years ago, there were very, very few Ecuadorians here in Milan. I was surely one of the very first,\" said Ruperto Ceron, who runs a business with 20 employees that cleans offices and apartments. \"At the beginning, it was very difficult to get a license to start a company. There was endless paperwork that made it especially hard for us non-Europeans, but that has been simplified and now Italians are getting used to dealing with companies run by people who are not from here.\"\nMilan has taken a large slice of Italy's new arrivals, and 250,000 immigrants - or one out of every 10 legal immigrants in the country - lives in the city or the surrounding area, according to Caritas. That is almost as much as in Rome, whose population is twice that of Milan.\nThere are other indications that non-European immigrants are having a growing effect on Milan. About 13 percent of all real estate transactions involve non-Europeans, according to Tecnocasa, an Italian real estate agent. With Italians having one of the lowest birthrates in the world, the children of immigrants have kept some schools from closing while their parents pay into a pension system that could not survive without them.\nAs the immigration population grows so does the discontent some Milanese feel about the changes their city is going through. Racist comments from high-level politicians are not uncommon.\n\"Overt racism is not very common and is much rarer than in France and England,\" said Peter Konteh, a computer programmer from Sierra Leone who has lived in Milan for eight years. \"But Italians are still afraid of new cultures so they keep foreigners at a distance.\"\nBut Milan's non-European population continues to grow and a true multicultural city may not be far off. The mushrooming of Chinese clothing shops and the arrival of a few decent Thai restaurants can attest to that.\nSays Falen's wife, Carmen, who now works in the family business:\"Our clients tell us when they come here to the shop, 'The colors, the music, the people, I feel like I'm in my country.' That is what we give them, their country here in Milan.\"\n",

    "text": "Sarah Schulman softens her image\n2005-10-25T05:00:00.000Z\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Several days a week during the school year, the novelist and playwright Sarah Schulman takes a subway, a ferry and two buses to get from her cramped sixth-floor walkup in the East Village to a cramped classroom at the College of Staten Island, where she is a tenured professor of English.\nHer students this semester include Italian-Americans, African-Americans, Yemenis, Dominicans, Haitians, Lebanese, Azerbaijanis, Bangladeshis, Chinese, Koreans, Russians, Albanians from Albania and Albanians from Kosovo. \"Some can barely read out loud, and some know five languages,\" Schulman said. In any case, she learns their names by the second week and also what they mean.\nIf Schulman works so hard to reach her students, perhaps that's in part because the world, as she sees it, has not always done as much for her. She has not, for instance, been as successful as she feels she deserves to be. Oh, she's been recognized; her seven published novels and two works of nonfiction have won many awards (she was a finalist for the Prix de Rome), while her playwriting has earned her most of the plum residencies and fellowships available. But there is still the constant effort to get theaters to mount her work, while some writers she considers her peers have, she says, \"more personal choice about which of their plays will be produced.\"\nSchulman feels there's a simple reason she isn't among them: She's a lesbian who writes openly about lesbians in an industry largely run by men. \"Often, works that reinforce dominant fantasies about oppressed people are inflated beyond their merit,\" she said in an e-mail message, judiciously omitting the names of the works she meant. Whereas works like hers, she said, address oppression from a \"more authentic perspective\" and are therefore ruthlessly marginalized.\nThough her speech is armored with jargon, the effect is often mitigated, in person, by her almost maternal warmth. Still, I found myself repeatedly preparing to flinch as she stalked me for bad motives, tired agendas and prejudices; when she thought she spied one she pounced as if to drag it from behind some trees and let it rot in the sun.\nThis was Schulman in her holy terror mode, scaled down for the diner where we were talking. In public, her attacks and pronouncements have made her a controversial figure. She paints herself as a nearly solitary pioneer in advancing lesbian theater. After a discussion among leading gay writers at a national conference, people who were in attendance say, she stood up and challenged the panelists (she says she spoke calmly), demanding to know what they personally were doing about the lack of lesbian plays in production in America. A perfectly reasonable, even important, issue, although antagonizing your allies is not always an effective strategy.\nBut then, Schulman apparently doesn't think gay male writers are necessarily her allies.\nHer fearlessness has won her a reputation for difficulty and may have impeded her progress in the insular and touchy theater world. Certainly her plays - serious reflections on life at the margins, frequently experimental in structure or satirical in tone - have not achieved the acclaim of her fiction. Her novels are published by major houses and reviewed respectfully. Her plays, on the other hand, have until recently been produced at \"rat-infested parking lots\" or downtown dives. They have received a few mainstream reviews, ranging from scornful to glowing, but have mostly been ignored.\nBecause she finds that intolerable, Schulman set out, around 1994, to beat the system. And now, at 47, she finally seems poised for a substantial breakthrough. Her new play, \"Manic Flight Reaction,\" which is in previews at Playwrights Horizons and opens Sunday, wraps a typically serious Schulman theme (the need to take responsibility for the pain you cause others) in a delightful premise: a young woman discovers that her mother's ex-lover is now the wife of a Republican presidential candidate. Will she be outed? It's a surprise to find Schulman working this comic vein. But even more so, it's a surprise to see her slyly question the assumptions of all the characters: not just obvious bad guys but also the delightful main character, Marge, a 50-ish lesbian academic described in the stage directions as \"struggling to settle - at the last minute - into normalcy, but lovingly.\"\n 1 \n2\nNext Page \u00bb\n",

    "text": "Who Has the Work? He Who Finds the Busboys\n2005-05-27T05:00:00.000Z\nThe dingy office on the fourth floor of an old Chelsea building is where the ghosts come to find work.\nThey are ghosts because they do not exist here in the city, not legally. Most have just come from the southern part of Mexico without visas, green cards or any other official document that proves their existence.\nBut even ghosts need to eat, and when they ask on the street \"Who has work?\" the answer many hear is Mr. Dinos.\nDinos Kazanis is a strange ally. He does not speak more than a few words of broken Spanish. His English echoes with bass notes of Greek. When he shouts, it is hard to tell what language he is using, and he shouts all the time. He is rude. \"I don't have job,\" he thunders into the phone. \"Why are you calling me now?\"\nBut the ghosts keep coming.\nSince 1986, shortly after he came to New York from Greece, he has run his own employment agency, helping the Greeks, who still own many of the city's diners and coffee shops, hire the busboys, dishwashers and waiters that keep their businesses going.\nIn a complex, constantly changing city, niche businesses keep things humming. Fifteen years ago Mr. Kazanis sent men from Bangladesh and China to fill the back-of-the-house positions in restaurant kitchens. But the population of Mexicans in the city tripled during the 1990's, making Mexicans one of the fastest-growing groups in New York. Now he specializes almost exclusively in sending Mexican workers to Greek restaurants and diners.\n\"They are very good quality workers,\" Mr. Kazanis says one morning, his words a drumbeat of Old World vowels and New World weariness. \"If these illegals leave New York City, New York will die. I know.\"\nMost of the workers he sends for jobs are thin young men with shallow cheeks and dark eyes who have come illegally from the parts of Mexico that have not benefited from that country's deepening economic ties with the United States.\nEvery weekday morning they come to Mr. Kazanis's Atlas Employment Agency -- everybody calls it Mr. Dinos' -- as soon as he opens at 7 a.m.\nThe office's windows are dim with dirt. The carpet is threadbare, the gray metal desks are banged up and the walls are covered with as much grime as paint. Behind him are three American flags and a small poster proclaiming, \"Proud to be an American.\"\nHe became a citizen a few years ago and now Mr. Kazanis, 66, is often the only American in the office. The Mexican job seekers sit in two rows of dirty plastic chairs, with a blurry television tuned to Spanish-language soap operas. Mr. Kazanis says experienced cooks are picked right away. But most who come here have no skills, so they wait.\nAt 11:15, he takes a call from the frantic owner who has just realized that with lunch about to begin, he is short one busboy. Holding the phone with his shoulder, Mr. Kazanis looks out over the dozen young men who have been waiting to be called.\n\"Busboy,\" he shouts. \"Rapido.\"\nFrom the second row, back near the wall, a young man with a backpack stands up.\n\"Trabajo,\" Mr. Kazanis says -- \"work\" -- after the man has come to stand by his battered desk as sheepishly as if he had been called to the principal's office. \"Start at 12 o'clock. You leave at 11:30.\"\nThe young man, who says his name is Rodolfo, came less than a year ago from the state of Puebla, the starting point for the uncertain voyages of many other Mexicans in New York. He had been working at another Greek diner but he wanted a different schedule, and he was confident Mr. Kazanis would find something for him.\nIt is a pattern followed by many Mexicans in the city who bounce from job to job. Little changes -- not salary, nor hours, nor working conditions nor, for many, the chances of getting ahead.\n\"The vast majority of them never experience any promotion or job seniority,\" says Saru Jayaraman, executive director of the Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York, a labor rights group. \"Most never move up at all.\"\nSo Rodolfo says he will take the job. He fills out an application.\n\"Busboy, and delivery,\" Mr. Kazanis repeats. \"Is good. You have bike?\"\n\"Yes, and I have a helicopter, too.\"\nRodolfo looks back at his friends and laughs.\n\"Helicopter better,\" Mr. Kazanis says.\nThen it is back to business. \"I tell you, they pay more than minimum. Six days, 12:30 to 10. Saturday off. Sunday 3 to 12.\" A 50-hour week, for which he will make $500, without health benefits.\n\"If you have any problems call me,\" Mr. Kazanis says. \"The owner is my friend. I help this guy too many times. When you get there, see Mr. Nick. How you get there? Take the train, No. 6, uptown. You pay now.\"\n\"How much?\" Rodolfo asks, though he knows the fee is $100, half in advance, and the remainder due after the first paycheck.\n\"For you, $1,000.\"\nRodolfo takes two twenties and a ten from a small roll of bills in his pocket and leaves.\nMr. Kazanis looks at the application card he filled out. Except for his first name and a cellphone number, Rodolfo has left the card blank.\n\"You believe they tell me the truth over here? They don't have ID. There's no way to check. I have too many guys with the same last name.\"\nHe knows they are illegal. The owners who hire them know they are illegal. Immigration officials know where to find them. But they rarely try. There are more than 200,000 Mexicans in New York, according to city officials, and most are illegal. They are the poorest immigrants, but they also have about the lowest unemployment rate, in part because New York businesses need them.\nThe perpetual cycle of job seekers brings in a steady income, but no great fortune. There is something else that motivates Mr. Kazanis, something called empathy, a word with good Greek roots. He wants to help them because their struggles are familiar.\n\"The Italians, the Greeks, the Polish, they were all illegals,\" Mr. Kazanis says. \"It's the same story now.\"\nIt is 11:45 a.m. by the time he puts down the graying Rolodex cards with the names of diners and their owners. He calls over one of the Mexicans waiting in his office and hands him $25.\n\"Wendy's. Rapido,\" he says.\nIt is a daily ritual, followed religiously. A hamburger for each man still waiting for work, and one for Mr. Kazanis, too. Later, he will pass through the rows of chairs with a two-liter bottle of soda and a sleeve of plastic cups. He insists it is not charity, but a business tool.\n\"I have to give them food,\" he says. \"If I don't and they go out to eat, I don't have anybody to send to anybody if they call.\" But he knows few calls come in the afternoon.\nThe men eat in silence. Some hold on to their burgers, waiting for the darkness of night when there may be nothing else to eat. Mr. Kazanis never charges for the food, nor does he object to the men spending the whole day in his office.\n\"O.K., Dinos,\" one of the Mexicans says from across the room after he has finished his burger. \"Now I want to work.\"\nMr. Kazanis looks through his cards, takes a heavy breath and picks up his ringing phone.\n\"At-las. Who is this?\"",

    "text": "Report on Abuse by U.N. Workers Recommends Punishment\n2005-03-24T05:00:00.000Z\n>\n UNITED NATIONS, March 24 - A report on sexual abuse by peacekeepers recommended today that offending soldiers and their commanders be punished by their home countries, that payments made to them be recovered and put into a fund benefiting victims and that the United Nations make cooperation with these measures a condition for participation in missions.\n In addition, it recommended that the United Nations make counseling and medical care available to victims and provide assistance for \"peacekeeper babies\" left behind when the troops return to their own countries.\n Secretary General Kofi Annan commissioned the report from Prince Zeid Raad al-Hussein, Jordan's ambassador to the United Nations, after evidence emerged that blue-helmeted peacekeepers and civilian staff had sex with women and girls in Congo in exchange for food and money and, in some cases, committed rape.\n Prince Zeid, a former military officer and civilian peacekeeper in Bosnia, said that efforts to curb abuses were \"ad hoc and inadequate\" and that exploitative behavior was widespread.\n In a cover letter to the report, Mr. Annan said that while peacekeeping had brought stability to many countries over decades, the record had been damaged by acts he termed \"unconscionable\" and that present measures were \"manifestly inadequate.\"\n \"Such abhorrent acts are a violation of the fundamental duty of care that all United Nations peacekeeping personnel owe to the local populations they serve,\" Mr. Annan said, adding that a \"fundamental change in approach was needed.\"\n Sarah Mendelson, a senior fellow in the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and a vocal critic of the United Nations' past response to the sexual abuse scandal, hailed the report as \"extremely important, I would even say revolutionary.\"\n \"The idea that peacekeepers will be held responsible for paternity, that there is assistance for victims, that there is a system to incentivize and reward those who invest properly in the program, there are a lot of things here that a lot of us have been talking about for a long time,\" she said in an interview.\n The report noted that the United Nations had no authority to punish violators and said that troop-contributing countries should agree to hold courts-martial of their accused soldiers in the countries where the alleged abuse occurred. Those countries with national laws preventing that should consider legislation to permit it.\n In addition, Prince Zeid said, the United Nations should establish independent investigative teams staffed by experts in sex crimes, particularly those against children, and armed with modern forensic methods of identification.\n He called for expanding the policy of setting curfews, declaring areas off-limits and making patrols mobile and said that missions needed to have better recreational services for off-duty troops and subsidized telephone and Internet connections to help them stay in touch with family and friends.\n It recommended that peacekeeping missions set up clear lines of communication to allow local people to lodge accusations and obtain emergency medical and psychological attention. It also recommended data tracking mechanisms to record the complaints in a systematic way to avoid duplication and hearsay.\n In a step to make commanders responsible for the actions of their troops, the report said those who obstruct investigations into sexual abuse should be removed and repatriated, and the secretary general should advise the head of state of the home country why the action was taken. In addition, the United Nations should recover any payments made to the commander and give the money to fund for the victims.\n Prince Zeid added that it was important also to champion commanders who cooperated, and recommended that the secretary general reward such behavior with written commendations to their heads of state.\n Where an investigation shows that accusations are well founded, the charges ought to be sent to the home country of the offending soldier with a recommendation that he be prosecuted. Prince Zeid said that while a decision to prosecute was a sovereign decision, the United Nations ought to insist on prior cooperation in the memos of understanding governing each mission.\n Many of Prince Zeid's recommendations stemmed from the fact that the United Nations has little authority of its own to punish those suspected of sex offenses other than to send them home where they seldom face prosecution. Other offenders have often been innocently rotated out to their home countries by the time they are identified.\n The United Nations has also been concerned not to discourage countries from remaining troop contributors. According to the department of peacekeeping operations, the 10 leading nations furnishing soldiers are, in order, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Ethiopia, Nepal, Ghana, Nigeria, Jordan, Uruguay and South Africa.\n The United Nations is experiencing a surge in peacekeeping, with 17 missions involving 80,000 people. The report said that the United Nations in 2004 had received 25 allegations of sexual exploitation against civilians and civilian police and 80 against uniformed personnel. The majority of them involved sex with persons under the age of 18.",

    "text": "Poverty and Superstition Hinder Drive to Block Bird Flu at Source\n2005-11-03T05:00:00.000Z\nPREY ROGNIENG, Cambodia - When the half-starved chickens started dying this summer and the barefoot children developed fevers here in this village of thatched huts and emerald rice fields, residents were terrified and deeply divided about the cause of their misfortune.\nSome blamed bird flu and took their weakened children to a clinic in a nearby provincial city, where a medic diagnosed human influenza instead. But other residents said it was witchcraft by the only village resident not born here, 53-year-old Som Sorn, who moved here eight years ago when she married an elderly local farmer.\nWhen Mrs. Som Sorn's husband went into the jungle to cut wood one afternoon and she began cooking rice over a fire on the dirt floor of her hut, a local man with a machete took action and later collected $30 in donations from grateful neighbors, a month's wages.\n\"The assassin grabbed her hair, pulled her head back and cut her throat,\" said Ya Pheorng, the village leader. \"Her neck was almost completely severed.\"\nThe sorcery allegation and grisly killing underline what United Nations and American officials describe as the difficulty of preventing a global human epidemic of bird flu: the disease is most prevalent among poultry and wild birds in impoverished rural areas of Southeast Asia with low levels of literacy, high levels of superstition and very little health care.\nIf the disease does make the jump from transmission by birds to person-to-person transmission, the crucial question will be whether the first few cases can be isolated quickly. If not, frightened people nearby could start fleeing, carrying the disease to big cities and then around the world by jet. In a telephone interview at the end of a recent weeklong trip to Southeast Asia, Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, compared the early stages of a flu pandemic to the beginnings of a forest fire.\n\"If one happens to be at the source of the spark, it's simple to put it out with your foot,\" he said. \"The question is, will we be there?\"\nOnly four countries, all in Southeast Asia, have had laboratory-confirmed human cases of bird flu so far: Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. Cambodia is the poorest, with the most rudimentary health system outside urban areas.\nCambodia's difficulties and small successes in fighting bird flu are indicative of the struggle that lies ahead. Scientists predict the struggle could last for many years and may have to be fought in other poor areas as well, notably in India and Bangladesh and East Africa. But United Nations officials say the disease will probably remain most prevalent and most dangerous here in Southeast Asia, where chickens wander freely in and out of homes and even apartment buildings, mixing constantly and intimately with people to an extent not found in most other countries.\nIn two decades of turmoil beginning in the 1970's, most of Cambodia's doctors died in the Khmer Rouge's killing fields or fled the country. Many of the country's current generation of health care professionals can scarcely read or write and received rudimentary medical training in Vietnamese, a language they barely speak, during the Vietnamese occupation in the 1980's.\nSince the first chickens began dying of bird flu in Cambodia in January 2004, the country has made some progress, with modest foreign assistance, in controlling the disease in poultry and keeping people healthy. Yet formidable gaps linger in the country's defenses.\nThose gaps highlight the continued mismatch between limited efforts to slow the spread of bird flu among poultry in developing countries and increasingly large efforts by industrialized countries to prepare for a possible human outbreak. The United States and other industrialized countries are spending billions of dollars to stockpile antiviral medicines and other gear for treating people who may become infected. But the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization has been able to collect only $30 million from industrialized nations since February for a campaign to delay or prevent an epidemic, a little over one-sixth of the $175 million and rising that the F.A.O. says is needed.\nIn Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital, American and German foreign aid has just helped supply the latest Western equipment to a virology lab at the Cambodian government's animal health department. But the virus samples are taken for testing from chicken carcasses brought in from all over the country to a moldering building next door. Researchers cut apart the carcasses in a room with no air-conditioning and a fan that blows air out the windows and across an alley. A crowded elementary school with no glass in its windows is just 10 yards away.\n\"They need to completely seal this area,\" said Dr. Lu Huaguang, a Pennsylvania State University avian virologist temporarily working in Phnom Penh to help set up the virology lab.\nAt the Food and Agriculture Organization's office a few blocks away, Tsukasa Kimoto, the chief representative, talks proudly of an innovative program to train the country's 6,000 village animal health workers to identify bird flu and report it immediately. But only 500 of these workers have been trained so far, he acknowledged, and the virus may be back soon, as it appears to be most active here from December through March.\nMost of the poultry in Cambodia roams so freely that if one bird is found sick, it is practically impossible to catch and kill nearby birds to curb the spread of the disease, Mr. Kimoto said.\n\"Chasing those chickens one after another is a rather tedious thing -- we don't have the people,\" he said.\nAt Cambodia's Health Ministry nearby, Dr. Chea Chhay, the under secretary charged with leading his country's fight against avian influenza, proudly described how teams of researchers were ready to drive on an hour's notice to regions reporting bird deaths. But many villages lack phones, to say nothing of doctors, and it may take a day or two during the rainy season for anyone from a remote village even to reach a phone.\n[President Bush asked Congress on Nov. 1 to approve $7.1 billion for bird-flu prevention and treatment, including $251 million for early detection overseas.]\nDrive just 35 miles west from Phnom Penh to this small village and the logistical challenge of confronting bird flu is even more apparent. The government built a small concrete-walled clinic eight years ago in an adjacent village, but electrical lines were never extended from the nearest town and no generator was installed so the clinic's lights have never worked.\nThe clinic's director, Pol Wana, was about to complete junior high school when the Khmer Rouge took over in 1975 and shut all schools. He never returned to school, but leads a staff of 10 in diagnosing ailments and prescribing and distributing medicine.\nThe government asked him to look out for bird flu, he said, but has not given him a clear list of symptoms.\nMai Morm, a 76-year-old farmer, stopped by the clinic late one morning to pick up medicine for a chronic cough. He said if any of his chickens fell sick, he would not tell anyone for fear the government might arrange for the rest to be slaughtered without compensation. \"If they were very sick before they died then I might throw them in the brush,\" he said. \"But if they were only a little sick, I'd probably eat them.\"\nThe killing of Mrs. Som Sorn was first reported by the small Cambodia Daily in an article about sorcery. The killer had not expected anyone to identify him to the police, and was surprised to be arrested and sentenced to 15 to 20 years in prison, Mr. Ya Pheorng said. Neighbors who paid her killer were not prosecuted after making further payments to the police, the village leader added.\nBesa Korn, a 51-year-old village resident who was not among those making donations to the killer, said the true cause of the summer illnesses might never be known. But life has clearly improved since Mrs. Som Sorn's death, she added.\n\"Everyone in the village has been very happy since then,\" she said. \"And we have had no more illness.\"",

    "text": "Virus Ravaging India's Poor Stirs Call for Counterattack\n2005-09-08T05:00:00.000Z\nLUCKNOW, India, Sept. 7 - Government ministers descended on this storied North Indian state capital on Wednesday to kick off an ambitious rural health initiative. The city's roads were freshly tarred, and banners hung along the main boulevard to welcome its chief guest: former President Bill Clinton.\nBut across town in a government hospital ward with paint peeling off its walls lay small children clinging to life. One, in her father's arms, could barely swallow spoonfuls of milk. Another had been unconscious for 10 days. A third could not breathe on his own.\nAll were victims of the viral disease known as Japanese encephalitis, which causes high fever, aches, eventual coma and often death. It has struck this region with a particular fury this year, shining a harsh light on India's inability to halt an entirely preventable disease that has killed or stunted some of its most vulnerable citizens for the last quarter-century -- the young rural poor.\nThe director general of the state government's health department said Wednesday that since July 1 the death toll had reached nearly 500, and those were only cases reported to government hospitals across the state. Reuters on Wednesday gave a figure of 600.\nMore than 1,500 suspected cases of Japanese encephalitis have been reported so far, according to the state.\nAnd while the number of suspected cases is considerably higher than in past years -- five times as high as the counts in the last few years at the King George Medical University hospital here, for instance -- critics said that the rise should be no surprise to government health officials and that the misery inflicted could have been significantly reduced.\nThis year, only 200,000 of the 7 million children who needed to be immunized in high-risk areas of Uttar Pradesh were vaccinated, and other ways of preventing its spread -- keeping pigs, which harbor the virus, at a safe distance from people, and spraying against mosquitoes, which ferry it to humans -- were apparently inadequately pursued.\n\"There is gross apathy of the government,\" said T.N. Dhole, a professor of microbiology at the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences here, fresh from a tour of some of the most badly affected district hospitals. \"You could have reduced mortality if you had done a little homework before.\"\nEven as the rural health initiative begins, the United Nations released its annual human development report on Wednesday, showing unsettling rates of infant mortality in this country.\nFor every 1,000 Indian children, 63 die, according to the report, a rate worse than neighboring and far poorer Bangladesh. Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous province, is one of the four Indian states with the worst rates of infant mortality.\nOver all, India spends less than 1 percent of its gross domestic product on public health; the government has pledged to increase that share.\nThe encephalitis virus grows in wading birds as well as pigs; children are often the mosquitoes' main victims.\nApproved vaccines are in short supply worldwide, though another vaccine, derived from the cells of hamster kidneys, is widely available but yet to be approved by the World Health Organization. India says it plans to conduct clinical test trials of that vaccine, but that will not happen in time to help the children who need it now.\nIn Uttar Pradesh, the central government health minister, Dr. Ambubani Ramadoss, said in an interview here on Wednesday that he would encourage state health officials to mount a more aggressive spraying operation. State health officials have said health department staff members and vehicles, which could have been deployed to spray high-risk areas and monitor Japanese encephalitis, were deployed for local election duty in July and August -- the crucial mosquito-breeding months.\nPigs are reared primarily by the caste groups, mostly poor and landless, who make up an important source of votes for the state's ruling party. \"Some political problems,\" is how the state's director general of health and medicine, O.P. Singh, put it. \"They will try to separate next year.\"\nHe was cheerful about the challenge. Next year, he said, the government would procure additional vaccines. \"We will get vaccinations,\" he said. \"We will do it.\"\nIn Gorakhpur, the eastern Uttar Pradesh epicenter of the epidemic, not a single corner of the three encephalitis wards in the local government hospital was free of misery and stink. Children were hooked up to nasal feeding tubes and oxygen tanks, and distraught parents camped out on the floor. In most beds, two children had been squeezed in. Additional beds spilled out into the hallways. Medical personnel have poured in from outlying areas to help.\nOn Wednesday alone, 30 new patients were wheeled in.\nDr. Ramadoss said it was primarily the state government's responsibility to stop the epidemic. Then he corrected himself. \"It's a collective responsibility but implementation is for the state,\" he said. \"The state government has to be more proactive.\"\nDr. Ramadoss pointed out that India was now a destination for medical tourism, its private clinics drawing foreigners seeking medical treatment.\nBy the time children arrived at the hospital at King George Medical University, they were either unconscious or suffering from seizures, or had lost some of their motor skills. Parents said they had watched their children deteriorate as they went from village doctor to local hospital to here.\nAs a rule, rural hospitals in this country are in short supply of oxygen, medicine and qualified staff.\n\"If you caught a child early on and gave him supportive treatment, yes, you would save some children,\" said Rashmi Kumar, a pediatrician at the hospital. Of the six children who were in one of the encephalitis wards, she found it hard to say how many would survive.\nThe one ray of hope was Brijesh, 6, who had stood on his own and, holding his father's fingers, walked a few steps along the hospital floor.\nHe was running a fever of 102 when he was admitted a week ago. He had had two seizures that very day. Before the fever gripped him, his father, Matadin, said, he would sprint across the village at the sound of a television set. Today he could barely whisper into his father's ears. \"Let's go home,\" he said.\nSoon enough, Brijesh will be able walk like a normal little boy. But, the doctors say, his cognitive abilities might never fully rebound.",

    "text": "Festival of Lights, Parade of Sweets\n2005-11-02T05:00:00.000Z\nCorrection Appended\nNEW YORKERS have learned to tread fearlessly in the world of real Indian food. They know pakoras from samosas and dabble in idlis and utthappams. But a confusing cloud often looms over the end of those meals: the sweet, colorful, mysteriously milky world of Indian desserts.\n\"I get so sad reading reviews of Indian restaurants; they always end, 'As usual, the desserts were nothing to write home about,' or worse,\" says Maya Kaimal, the author of two Indian cookbooks and a frequent visitor to the state of Kerala in southern India. \"But what you have to understand is that although Indians adore sweets, there is really no such thing as dessert there.\"\nIndian sweets, called mithai, are a thing apart, served alone or with a cup of chai for an afternoon or late-night snack that is both stimulating and soothing. Although they are made from simple ingredients, like butter, milk, nuts and spices, they take wild forms and colors, like pumpkin-orange jalebi filled with sugar syrup and hot-pink Twinkie-shaped chumchums, a specialty of West Bengal, the capital of Indian confectionery.\n\"Mithai are like physical therapy for Indians,\" says Arun Sinha, owner of Foods of India on Lexington Avenue. \"You come home after work, you have one small piece, you eat it slowly and you become completely relaxed. And when you ask for another piece, your wife must say, No!\"\nThe festive piles of pink, green, yellow, orange and white sweets, some shimmering with silver leaf, others snowy with shreds of coconut or crunchy with nuggets of pistachio, are integral to many religious celebrations and social rituals in South Asia.\nThis week, in a coincidence of calendars, Hindus and Muslims from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh are celebrating the most joyous holidays of the year. Hindus observe the festival of lights, Diwali, or Deepavali, which ushers in the new year; Muslims finish the holy month of Ramadan with Id al-Fitr, which signals the end of the monthlong daytime fast and a return to the sweetness of daily life.\nThe two holidays, Hindus and Muslims here say, are utterly soaked in sugar. \"You cannot go to anyone's house at this time of year without a quarter-pound of something sweet,\" says Padma Dasgupta, a writer in Jericho, N.Y.\nShristi Mittal, a Columbia student from Delhi, recently shopped at Foods of India for sweets and diyas, small pottery cups that are filled with wax or ghee and lighted at night during Diwali. (Diwali means row of lights.) \"If you have mithai and diyas, even a dorm room feels like India,\" she said.\nMithai are integral to many ceremonial occasions -- the first gift of an Indian bride to the family of her betrothed is often 50 pounds of top-quality mithai -- but none more so than Diwali, which is observed by sending elaborate gift boxes of sweets, dried fruit and nuts to family and friends. (Crowds of Diwali shoppers were targets of terrorist bombs that killed about 60 people in New Delhi on Saturday, a reminder of the region's dangerous divisions, even at a time of religious unity in a sweet ritual.)\nSukhadia's, a sweetmaker based in Iselin, N.J., does 40 percent of its business for the year in the month before Diwali. \"Every pharmaceutical company now knows to send Diwali sweets to the Indian doctors, and the banks send them to the Indian diamond merchants,\" Philip Sukhadia, the company's owner, said.\nBut mithai also have a real spiritual significance for Hindus. Sweetmaking has been an honored culinary specialty in India since the time of the ancient Vedic texts, about 1000 B.C.; the word sugar is most likely descended from the Sanskrit sarkar. And the cult of dairy goes even further back. \"Ghee and milk are adored in India, almost worshiped,\" Mr. Sukhadia said. \"The cow is everyone's mother.\" (Thus, most Hindus do not eat beef.)\nLord Krishna, the most beloved of the creator-gods worshiped by Hindus, is often depicted as a fun-loving boy, always dipping his fingers into the butter churn. In Indian culture his attraction to milkmaids is a frequent theme, and in sacred images he is almost always accompanied by a bull.\nThe holiday of Diwali, though, is dedicated to Lord Ganesha and his sister Lakshmi. Ganesha is the god with an elephant's head who presides over all kinds of new enterprises; he is often shown with a plate of his favorite mithai, boondi laddoos: round, crunchy sweets flavored with cardamom that resemble Rice Krispies treats. Boondi laddoos are offered to Ganesha as prasadam, or offering, during Diwali. Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and good fortune, is best propitiated with the most brightly colored mithai, preferably shining with shards of edible silver or gold, called vark.\nDuring Diwali, everyone is expected to give mithai to the poor, and sweetmakers make once-a-year treats like ghughra: turnovers filled with mawa (rather like sweet ricotta), coconut and nuts, and deep-fried in ghee. In the United States, ghee made from butter is often called desi ghee to distinguish it from vegetable-based substitutes; the word desi, which means something close to \"countryman,\" always evokes a strong, authentic connection to the homeland for the Indian diaspora.\nFor Muslims, other sweets have special significance this week. After 30 days of fasting, the first morning after Ramadan is called meethi Id (sweet Id). In Pakistan, children traditionally make the rounds in their neighborhoods, carrying bowls of seviyan (threadlike dry pasta cooked in sweet milk with nuts and cardamom and served cold, not unlike breakfast cereal).\nTwo weeks before Id, at Shalimar in Iselin, N.J., Neera Saeed ordered 80 servings of rasmalai, a wonderfully creamy bowl of pillowy fresh cheese, bathed in sweet milk perfumed with cardamom, sprinkled with pistachios and served very cold.\nMithai are intended to be intensely sweet; they are more closely related to candies like fudge and chocolate truffles than to desserts. But only poor quality and stale mithai taste exclusively of sugar. When made with pure clarified butter (ghee) and caramelized whole milk, flavored naturally and served immediately, they are rich, soft and delicate, like a slice of Junior's cheesecake. (There is no higher praise.)\nFor years, my questions about mithai received the same answer: \"It's a kind of milk sweet.\" I thought this unlikely, but I was wrong. Although there are hundreds of kinds of mithai available here (and thousands more in India, where each city is renowned for a different sweet), it's true that they are almost all based on milk. Whole milk might be boiled down to a sweet sludge, churned into curds, chilled, grated, stretched, or scooped.\nEach of these variations has a different name and use. The mixture may be colored with saffron (yellow and orange), pistachio nuts (green), or the fruit called chickoo or sapodilla (pink). Besan (chickpea flour) may be added, or rice; the result may be deep-fried in ghee or soaked in sugar syrup, or both.\nCardamom -- which Ms. Kaimal, the cookbook author, calls the vanilla of India -- is routinely used to perfume many mithai. I found the lightly cooked, pure white sweet called kalakand most pleasing, followed closely by burfi, concentrated milk mixed with almonds, walnuts or cashews.\nThe modest facade of Usha Foods in Floral Park, Queens, like that of many local mithai makers, is really a front for a huge catering business. Weddings for a thousand people are routine in the Hindu community. Usha caters 50 parties a week at Hindu temples, Jain family events and the like.\nIndira Mathur, the owner, buys at least 300 gallons of milk every day, and around Diwali the operation never stops production. Each batch of burfi, for example, must be stirredsteadily for four hours, a reason few people still make mithai at home. \"At Diwali we try to make sure that the mithai we offer to the deity is homemade,\" Ms. Dasgupta, the writer, said. \"But otherwise it just takes too long. In New York, who has time?\"\nLands of Milk, Nuts and Ghee\nHERE are some places in the New York metropolitan area to buy good mithai:\nBENGALI SWEET HOUSE -- 836 Newark Avenue, Jersey City, (201) 798-9241, and other locations; www.bengalisweet.com.\nDELHI PALACE -- 37-33 74th Street (37th Avenue), Jackson Heights, Queens, (718) 507-0666.\nFOODS OF INDIA -- 121 Lexington Avenue, (212) 683-4419.\nMAHARAJAH -- 73-10 37th Avenue (73rd Street), Jackson Heights, Queens, (718) 505-2680.\nSHALIMAR -- 1335 Oak Tree Road, Iselin, N.J., (732) 283-3350.\nSUKHADIA'S -- 17 West 45th Street (Fifth Avenue), (212) 395-7300 and other locations, www.sukhadia.com.\nUSHA FOODS -- 255-03 Hillside Avenue, Floral Park, Queens; (718) 343-1500.\nCOCONUT BURFI Adapted from Maya Kaimal Time: 30 minutes, plus cooling time\n1/2 teaspoon unsalted butter 1 1/2 cups sugar 3 cups sweetened shredded coconut 1/4 cup nonfat dry milk 1/4 cup half-and-half 2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter) 1/4 teaspoon almond extract (optional) 1/4 cup chopped pistachio nuts, for garnish.\n1. Line an 8-by-8-inch baking pan with aluminum foil. Smear foil with butter; set aside. 2. Put sugar and 3/4 cup water in saucepot and cook over medium heat for about 20 minutes, until texture becomes gummy and a spoon dipped in lifts a thread of syrup from the surface (220 degrees; thread stage). Add coconut, dry milk and half-and-half, and stir constantly until it forms a thick mass, about 2 minutes. 3. Add ghee and almond extract, if using. Cook over medium-low heat, turning mixture over to cook evenly, until a fine white foam appears around the edges, about 5 minutes. Keep cooking just until no more liquid is visible and mixture forms a single, almost dry mass, about 5 minutes more. Immediately turn onto buttered foil and use a spatula to spread and fill baking pan, making a 1/2-inch-thick layer (the surface will be rough). Sprinkle with pistachios. 4. Let cool 10 minutes, then remove foil and burfi to a cutting board. Use a long sharp knife to cut into squares or diamonds. Serve when completely cool, or refrigerate in an airtight container up to 3 days.\nYield: About 2 dozen pieces.\nCorrection: November 9, 2005, Wednesday An article last Wednesday about Indian sweets that are eaten during the Hindu holiday of Diwali described the significance of the holiday and the relationship of two Hindu deities imprecisely. Diwali commemorates various events; it is not dedicated to the deities Ganesha and Lakshmi. The two are considered siblings by only a minority of Hindus.",

    "text": "Crouching Tiger, Swimming Dragon\n2005-04-11T05:00:00.000Z\nNEW HAVEN - FIVE hundred and ninety years after a Chinese fleet cast anchor at Hormuz, the Chinese are back in the Arabian Sea. When Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China visited Pakistan last week, one of the many deals he signed was for the deepening of the port at Gwadar, whose Chinese-built facilities symbolize China's return to an area that was, briefly, a playground for its navy.\nThe port's just completed first phase -- three berths that can accommodate very large ships -- is relatively insignificant. But its projected size and strategic location have sent ripples of anxiety through Washington, Tokyo and New Delhi about the potential establishment of a permanent Chinese naval presence near the Strait of Hormuz, through which 40 percent of the world's oil passes.\nFor the sake of regional stability, Beijing should forgo any ambitions to use Gwadar for its naval vessels. Yet China has valid reasons to help develop a commercial port that other powers must accept. Its return to the Indian Ocean is the logical outcome of its blazing economic growth, which the West has encouraged, applauded and profited from. A China that depends increasingly on imported oil transported great distances can justifiably seek commercial refueling and repair facilities, just as European powers dependent on far-flung coaling stations for their ships did in the 19th century.\nFor a brief time in the 15th century, China had the means, but no deep-rooted rationale, for overseas expansion. The Middle Kingdom's maritime glory can be traced to the personal enthusiasm of a single ruler, the Ming emperor Yongle, who dispatched 63 vessels to the Indian Ocean in seven waves. China's first and thus far only blue-water navy consisted of multimasted ships weighing 1,500 tons -- Vasco da Gama's weighed only 300 tons -- and carried 27,500 men up to the Persian Gulf and Africa's eastern shore.\nAside from battling pirates and pretenders to the throne, the fleet served primarily as a propaganda vehicle for the emperor. Chinese sailors dazzled Asian states with their technological and military prowess, transported barbarian envoys willing to pay tribute to the Son of Heaven, and brought home exotic products, from aphrodisiac rhinoceros horns to live giraffes. But the expeditions ended as suddenly as they had begun. By the time the Portuguese Navy appeared in the Indian Ocean in 1497, the Chinese had already gone home.\nThis time, China's thirst for energy is dictating its turn to the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. Since 1993 China has been a net oil importer; as its need has grown to 40 percent of total consumption, so has its dependence on oil from the Middle East. Eighty percent of China's oil imports pass through the Malacca Straits, the closing of which would wreak havoc upon the Chinese economy. To reduce this dependence, China has been working to build alternative supply routes through Myanmar to the south and Pakistan to the west. A road, and eventually a pipeline, from Gwadar could give China an alternative energy route that it urgently needs and spur the development of its westernmost provinces. Hence its plan to provide more than a billion dollars in aid and loan guarantees for building at Gwadar.\nChina's search for energy security also dovetails, however, with its long-term strategic effort to expand its regional influence and box in India. Analysts see Chinese-operated listening posts in Myanmar's Coco Islands, China's support for a port near Yangon for handling 10,000-ton ships (of which the Burmese have only a few) and another deep-water port at Kyaukpyu in western Myanmar, Chinese aid to the Bangladeshi port of Chittagong and plans to improve Cambodia's Sihanoukville as part of an incremental effort to build a \"string of pearls\" presence on the Indian Ocean rim.\nMany believe it is only a matter of time before the Chinese Navy, much strengthened by recent purchases of ships and technology, arrives in Gwadar. Pakistani officials boast that Gwadar's Chinese connection will help to frustrate India's domination of regional waterways. A Chinese maritime presence in the area would enable the mainland to monitor naval patrols by the United States and protect Chinese sea lines of communication. China Economic Net, an online news outlet sponsored by China's leading business paper, calls Gwadar \"China's biggest harvest.\"\nThe fact remains, however, that with the exception of the Chinese \"fishing trawlers\" occasionally found mapping the ocean floor (information needed by submarines), the Chinese Navy has yet to show up. So for now, instead of raining on China's parade at Gwadar, India and the United States should welcome China's contribution to expanded maritime commerce and the additional sense of security that Beijing might derive from it. The port at Gwadar will be a boon to the regional economy; and to deny China's need for a secure oil supply while pumping billions of dollars into China to produce more gas-guzzling cars is both illogical and, in an indirect but palpable way, hostile. China should be left in no doubt, however, that using the Gwadar port for its military would increase tensions and weaken the energy security that it ostensibly seeks. Checking its frigates and submarines at the door would be a good way for China to ensure that others are also able to enjoy the party.\nOp-Ed Contributor Nayan Chanda, a former editor of the Far Eastern Economic Review, is the editor of YaleGlobal Online.",

    "text": "Report Calls for Punishing Peacekeepers in Sex Abuse\n2005-03-25T05:00:00.000Z\nUNITED NATIONS, March 24 - A report on sexual abuse by peacekeepers recommended Thursday that offending soldiers and their commanders be punished by their home countries, that payments made to them be recovered and put into a fund for victims and that the United Nations make compliance with these measures a condition for taking part in its missions.\nSecretary General Kofi Annan commissioned the report from Prince Zeid Raad al Hussein, Jordan's ambassador to the United Nations, after evidence emerged that blue helmeted peacekeepers and civilian staff members had had sex with women and girls in Congo in exchange for food and money, and, in some cases, had committed rape. The report also recommended that the United Nations make counseling and medical care available to victims and provide assistance for \"peacekeeper babies\" left behind when the troops rotate back to their own countries.\nPrince Zeid, a former military officer and civilian peacekeeper in Bosnia, said that current efforts to curb abuses were \"ad hoc and inadequate\" and that exploitative behavior was widespread.\nIn a cover letter, Mr. Annan said that while peacekeeping had brought stability to many countries over decades, the record had been damaged by acts he termed \"unconscionable\" and that present measures were \"manifestly inadequate.\"\n\"Such abhorrent acts are a violation of the fundamental duty of care that all United Nations peacekeeping personnel owe to the local populations they serve,\" Mr. Annan said, adding that a \"fundamental change in approach was needed.\"\nSarah E. Mendelson, a senior fellow in the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and a vocal critic of the United Nations's past response to the sexual abuse scandal, hailed the report as \"extremely important, I would even say revolutionary.\"\n\"The idea that peacekeepers will be held responsible for paternity, that there is assistance for victims, that there is a system to incentivize and reward those who invest properly in the program, there are a lot of things here that a lot of us have been talking about for a long time,\" she said in an interview.\nSome of the measures recommended in the report can be carried out by Mr. Annan, but others are subject to the approval of the 191-member General Assembly.\nThe report noted that the United Nations had no authority to punish violators and said that countries contributing troops should agree to hold courts-martial of their accused soldiers in the countries where the alleged abuse occurred. Those countries with national laws preventing that should consider legislation to permit it, the report said.\nIn addition, Prince Zeid said, the United Nations should establish independent investigative teams with experts in sex crimes, particularly those against children, and modern forensic methods of identification.\nHe called for expanding the policy of setting curfews, declaring areas off limits and making patrols mobile, and said that missions needed to have better recreational services for off-duty troops and subsidized telephone and Internet connections to help them stay in touch with relatives and friends.\nIt recommended that peacekeeping missions set up clear lines of communication to allow local people to lodge complaints and obtain emergency medical and psychological attention. It also recommended data tracking mechanisms to record complaints systematically to avoid duplication and hearsay.\nIn a step to make commanders responsible for the actions of their troops, Prince Zeid said in his report that those who obstruct investigations into sexual abuse should be removed and repatriated, and the secretary general should advise the head of state of the home country why the action was taken. In addition, the United Nations should recover any payments made to the commander and give the money to a fund for the victims.\nPrince Zeid added that it was important to champion commanders who cooperated, and recommended that the secretary general reward such behavior with written commendations to their heads of state.\nWhere an investigation shows that allegations are well founded, the charges ought to be sent to the home country of the offending soldier with a recommendation that he be prosecuted. Prince Zeid said that while a decision to prosecute was a sovereign decision, the United Nations ought to insist on prior cooperation in the memorandums of understanding governing each mission.\nMany of Prince Zeid's recommendations stemmed from the fact that the United Nations has little authority of its own to punish offenders other than to send them home where they seldom face prosecution. Other offenders have often been innocently rotated out to their home countries by the time they are identified.\nThe United Nations has also been concerned not to discourage countries from contributing troops. According to the department of peacekeeping operations, the 10 leading nations furnishing soldiers are, in order, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Ethiopia, Nepal, Ghana, Nigeria, Jordan, Uruguay and South Africa.\nThe United Nations is experiencing a surge in peacekeeping, with 17 missions involving 80,000 people. The report said that the United Nations in 2004 had received 25 allegations of sexual exploitation against civilians and civilian police officers and 80 against uniformed personnel. The majority of them involved sex with people under 18.",

    "text": "Beyond the Bullets and Blades\n2005-03-20T05:00:00.000Z\nBUNIA, Congo - THERE were two ailing boys, both appropriately named Innocent, at a makeshift hospital here. They didn't know it but they represented the two different ways of dying in Africa's wars.\nThe older of the two Innocents, at 14, was a victim of the most obvious killer -- violence. He had machete wounds to his neck, suffered as he tried to escape the tribal militiamen who swooped down on his village recently. Innocent's mother was killed. The men with machetes tried to sever Innocent's head, as well, but for some reason never finished the job. Innocent's neck had a series of deep hack marks when he arrived at the hospital in the arms of his father.\nDoctors at the hospital, which is run by Doctors Without Borders, rushed him to surgery and managed to bind the wounds. They are not yet sure if he will survive.\nThe younger Innocent, just 12, was from another village overrun by tribal fighters, albeit several years ago. He got out in time to avoid injury. But ever since, this Innocent has lived in a camp, huddled together with other displaced people. Still, his survival is in doubt. His arms are covered with mosquito bites and his blood is full of plasmodium parasites. Malaria kills if left untreated, which it often is in war zones like eastern Congo.\nThis Innocent will likely survive for now because he made it to a hospital. But he will get malaria again, and the wars that surround him will continue, and who knows if he will have access to a doctor then? And if it is not malaria that kills him, maybe it will be meningitis or measles or AIDS. Those scourges already kill far too many Africans, even in tranquil areas where a fragile social order holds together. Add war to that picture, and the death toll rises calamitously.\nThat is the second way of death in Africa's wars.\nHorrible though the genocidal spasms in Rwanda and the aerial bombings in Sudan have been, the vast majority of those who die in African war zones are not done in directly by warriors. Rather, it is the disruption that a few thousand armed men in ragtag militias can create in the lives of millions of civilians that send so many innocents to their graves.\nIn recent months, aid workers have begun providing a clearer picture of exactly why so many Africans die when conflict flares. Studies of two different war zones, by Physicians for Human Rights and by the International Rescue Committee, concluded separately that the major blame lies with the conditions created by wars in extremely fragile societies.\nThe first killer is flight. Desperately poor people are driven from their subsistence existence into even more hostile environments as they seek safety -- deep into the forest in the case of eastern Congo, across the desert into Chad to escape the unfolding violence in Darfur. Typically, the few hospitals that may exist are emptied, their supplies are looted and members of their staffs are forced to run, alongside everyone else. Fields that once fed families lie fallow. Livestock die. Relatives and neighbors who depend on each other become separated.\nDependency and depression can come to many who find their way to the relative safety of camps, and when these uprooted souls return to razed villages, there is little time to rest from the trauma. Life begins again, and now their social network of neighbors and health workers and people to trade with -- the thin fibers that knit lives together for survival -- may have been torn beyond repair. The numbers who die in Africa's wars are almost too high to contemplate. The fighting in Congo -- an amalgam of rebel insurgencies, tribal rivalries, competition for resources and just plain butchery without a cause -- has taken an estimated 3.8 million lives since 1998, making it the most deadly conflict since World War II, the International Rescue Committee estimated. Another two million lives have been lost in southern Sudan, where a war between the government and rebels ground on 21 years before a peace deal was signed in January. And Sudan's Darfur region, in the west, has lost more than 200,000 additional lives over two years of tribal pillaging. Fighting in northern Uganda, where rebels who purport to fight for the Ten Commandments abduct children to reinforce their ranks and chop off the lips and ears of those who dare resist, has taken an estimated 100,000 lives.\nGathering health data in war zones is obviously a risky enterprise. But the I.R.C. was able to conduct four mortality surveys in Congo over the last five years, each a little more extensive than the last. In the most recent one, covering January 2003 to April 2004, investigators surveyed 19,500 homes spread over every Congolese province (although they skipped some especially insecure parts of the country). They estimated that 31,000 people die every month from causes connected to conflict, most of them in the unstable east and most of them from disease. They found a mortality rate in eastern Congo that was 80 percent higher than the average rate for sub-Saharan Africa, where it is high in the best of times.\nMost deaths, the survey found, were due to maladies that are easily preventable and treatable in other parts of the world, such as malaria, diarrhea, respiratory infections and malnutrition. Less than 2 percent of the deaths were caused by violence.\n\"Life is a nightmare for these people,\" said Patrick Barbier, the chief of mission in Congo for Doctors Without Borders, which sees the same statistics borne out in its clinics. \"Militias prey on the girls. Militias take the people's food. On top of that, they demand weekly taxes. In most areas there is little or no access to health and even if there is a clinic, people have to pay but have nothing to pay with.\"\nThat is not to say there is no remedy. In Darfur, aid agencies are pushing for a compensation commission to help restore some of what the displaced people there have lost. More health workers familiar with disease are badly needed in most war zones. But the only way to finally stop the loss of life is to stop the fighting.\nIn Kanyabayonga, near Congo's border with Rwanda, an entire town of 30,000 people was emptied of its population last December. Soldiers, who were fighting other soldiers from the same army, looted each and every hut. They emptied the pharmacies and carried away any food they could find. This is the way soldiers who are rarely paid make ends meet.\nIt is also the way civilians die. They run into the forest and live amidst the trees. In the case of Kanyabayonga's population, they stayed away for weeks. They ate what little they could scrape together. Some of the most vulnerable, particularly the children and the elderly, succumbed to diseases. They are now buried in the bush. The town has been reinhabited, but the desperately poor are now poorer than before. The question is whether they can rebuild their lives somewhat before the next attack.\nFarther north, outside Bunia, where militias of the Lendu tribe are rampaging through villages inhabited by rival Hemas, a similar scene is unfolding. Civilians run for their lives. The slowest are killed on the spot. Most make it to safety and huddle together in camps. Last month, United Nations peacekeeping troops were protecting one of those camps, about 20 miles north of Bunia, when nine Bangladeshi soldiers were killed and mutilated by tribal fighters. The United Nations launched a counterattack. And in all the fighting, aid workers were blocked from reaching the camps.\nDoctors Without Borders made it to one camp in Tche recently and found that 25 people died during the eight days when no relief supplies could get in. At another camp, Kakwa, near Lake Albert, aid workers said, two or three people were dying each day in a camp of 5,000 people, a dangerously high rate of mortality. There were many cases of severe diarrhea with dehydration, which is a leading killer in places without proper medical care. A woman who delivered a baby and then bled for several days eventually just stopped breathing.\nThe weather and landscape are different in Darfur, the site of a continuing rebellion, but the dying is the same. Because there is no forest to hide in, local Sudanese Muslims fleeing militiamen linked to the Arab-led government in Khartoum head out into the harsh desert-like terrain. They, too, huddle together in camps, where they, too, continue to be harassed. (The camp population is now estimated to be approaching two million. Their deaths, too, come partly from violence and more often from what violence begets.)\nJan Egeland, the United Nations' top emergency relief official, estimated last week that 180,000 people may have died in Darfur of illness and malnutrition, far more than the estimated 50,000 who may have been shot, stabbed, bombed or burned. He now ranks Darfur as the second worst humanitarian crisis in the world, after Congo.\nIn Darfur, Physicians for Human Rights has studied the plight of one village near the border with Chad, a place called Furawiya that in mid-2003 and early 2004 was a stronghold for one rebel group and the site of repeated attacks by government troops and allied militias. Nobody knows for sure how many of the 13,000 people who once lived in and around Furawiya, and who now are displaced in camps, will outlive the fighting and eventually find their way home. But the study showed that the deaths would likely continue for years.\nThe village and everything in it that once kept people breathing are destroyed. The livestock, a form of wealth in East Africa, were killed, stolen or butchered on the spot. Crops were eaten or destroyed. Huts were burned. Wells were polluted. For now, most of the people are too scared to go back home. Even if they do, their social structures will be gone, food will be hard to come by, medical care will be absent and their bodies will be sapped of strength.\nNo bullet may pierce them, but they will be war victims just the same.",

    "text": "Health Officials Fear New Spread of Polio\n2005-02-10T05:00:00.000Z\n>\n Polio apparently reached Mecca, Islam's holy city, just before last month's annual pilgrimage by two million Muslims, and World Health Organization officials now fear that it could be spreading around the world, carried by returning pilgrims.\nIn crowded nations with spotty vaccination coverage, like Bangladesh and Indonesia, \"there could be substantial consequences,\" Dr. Bruce Aylward, coordinator of the W.H.O.'s Global Polio Eradication Initiative in Geneva, said in an interview.\n \"This is a crucial point,\" he added. \"We're staring at the whites of the eyes of this thing.\"\n A Saudi government spokesman said his country had feared the arrival of polio this year because it was known to be spreading across Africa. The Saudis started a sweeping polio inoculation campaign in September, hoping to head off the threat before the height of the hajj, or pilgrimage, in late January.\n Saudi Arabia had been polio-free since 1995, but two cases were found there late last year. The first, confirmed in late December, was in the port city of Jeddah in a girl who became paralyzed on Nov. 6, just after arriving from Sudan. The second, more worrisome case, became known today, Dr. Aylward said. It was discovered in a 5-year-old Nigerian boy who developed paralysis on Dec. 15. What made it more troubling was that his family had lived for several years in an illegal encampment on the outskirts of Mecca, so he must have caught it in Saudi Arabia. \n Spotting new outbreaks in far-flung countries will still take weeks, experts said. Paralysis affects only about 1 in 200 carriers of the virus, symptoms can take up to 35 days to emerge, pilgrims traveling by bus or boat can take weeks to get home, and epidemiological reporting in poor countries is often slipshod.\n \"You want to be well into March before you breathe a sigh of relief,\" Dr. Aylward said.\nThe virus lives in the intestine and spreads through fecal-oral contact, so anything from changing a diaper to sharing a food dish or swimming in contaminated water can transmit it. Polio vaccination was not required for hajj pilgrims because it was a rapidly diminishing threat until this year. Even if it was required, thousands of pilgrims arrive illegally, and many legal visitors carry forged immunization records, said the government spokesman, Nail al-Jubeir of the Saudi Embassy in Washington.\n \"We have to trust the health services of the countries they come from,\" he said. \"We can't give everyone blood tests.\"\n Polio has been spreading from northern Nigeria since 2003, when vaccination campaigns there were halted for months after Muslim imams and local politicians spread rumors that the vaccine could make women sterile, transmit AIDS or was made with pork products. \n Most cases related to that outbreak have been in the largely Muslim Sahel, the band of arid but arable land south of the Sahara Desert stretching from Mali to Ethiopia.\n The remaining pockets elsewhere are also mostly in Muslim areas: Pakistan, northern India, Afghanistan and Egypt.\n In September, Saudi Arabia began vaccinating 800,000 people in Mecca and in the Jeddah area, where pilgrims disembark. \n Each case of paralysis implies that many more virus-carriers are nearby. Most victims suffer symptoms no more serious than those of flu, but even people with no symptoms can pass the virus.\n In 1988, when polio was endemic in 125 countries, the annual assembly of the health ministers of all nations in Geneva declared their intent to eradicate it by the year 2000. That target was missed, but $3 billion in vaccination campaigns drove the disease back until it existed in only six countries by the end of 2003: Nigeria, India, Pakistan, Niger, Egypt and Afghanistan.\n But in 2002, Muslims in large swaths of Nigeria and Niger began resisting vaccination. The reasons were complex: religious and political rivalries, a failed drug trial, and reports of the controversial 1999 book \"The River,\" which linked AIDS to polio vaccinations in the Congo in the 1950's. \n The World Health Organization, Unicef, Rotary International and other groups fighting polio began intensive lobbying of local Nigerian officials, as did senior Islamic clerics from other countries.\n It took until last year to persuade the governor of Nigeria's Kano State, one of the loudest critics of the vaccine, to accept it as long as it was imported from a Muslim country. He inaugurated a new vaccination drive in October by allowing Nigeria's president, Olusegun Obasanjo, to give his daughter drops of a vaccine made in Indonesia.\n But by that time, the virus had escaped. Last year, paralysis cases appeared as far west as Mali and as far south as Botswana. Genetic testing identified them as a strain from Nigeria. \n \"In most of them, we were able to surround it and stop it from transmitting locally,\" said Dr. David L. Heymann, representative for polio eradication of the W.H.O. secretary-general.\n The most persistent migration was to the east, with cases spreading along the Sahel's highways. Sudan, which had been polio-free for three years, found a case imported from Chad in May 2004, and by late January had 112 cases, most of them in Darfur, on the Chad border, around the capital, Khartoum, and in the state bordering the Red Sea.\n Some Sudanese officials suggested that it had been spread by refugees fleeing fighting in southern Sudan, and a polio expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta recently offered that explanation. \n But Dr. Aylward said it \"didn't make any sense\" because the Khartoum refugee camps had existed for years and cases were exploding in Port Sudan, the jumping off point for Mecca.\n \"Tens of thousands of pilgrims pile up in Port Sudan, and they can be there for weeks or months,\" he said.\n Another urgent worry of his, he said, was that the hundreds of truckers from landlocked Ethiopia who use Port Sudan could carry polio back home, where immunization rates are low.\n Mr. Al-Jubeir said Saudi Arabia hires thousands of extra doctors for the hajj season, who watch for signs of disease among the millions entering through special airport and boat terminals set aside for pilgrims.\n However, he said, they cannot spot someone with no symptoms, and many people carry vaccination records that were stamped in return for bribes in their home countries.\n Also, he said, the Saudi border police have caught as many as 52,000 people a month sneaking into the country, mostly from Africa, through Yemen. \n \"It's a nightmare,\" he said. \n During the hajj, vast crowds circle the Grand Mosque and stone the pillars of Satan while pressed so closely together that, in some years, many have died in the crush. Hundreds of thousands live in government-inspected tent cities, but thousands camp illegally in the mountains around Mecca with no health or sanitation facilities.\n \"Before terrorism, our biggest concern was disease,\" Mr. al-Jubeir said.\n The 2000 hajj saw a serious outbreak of meningococcal meningitis. Now, pilgrims are supposed to show proof of vaccination against it before they board planes at home, and those from countries where meningitis is common are required to swallow an antibiotic upon arrival.\n This year the Saudis required those vaccinations and, for pilgrims from certain countries, yellow fever.\n Most Muslims who fly to Saudi Arabia each year do not normally bring their children, Dr. Aylward said, since the hajj is an obligation of adults and involves long treks under the desert sun. But pilgrims from Africa too poor to fly may have no choice.",

    "text": "Pakistan Quake Rocks South Asia; Over 18,000 Killed\n2005-10-09T05:00:00.000Z\nISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Sunday, Oct. 9 - A powerful earthquake centered in the Hindu Kush mountains of Pakistan on Saturday morning sent tremors across South Asia, killing more than 18,000 people, including at least 1,600 in remote northern Pakistan, among them hundreds across both sides of disputed Kashmir.\nMaj. Gen. Shaukat Sultan, Pakistan's chief army spokesman, who announced the toll on Sunday, said at least 45,000 people had been injured, a vast majority on the Pakistani side of Kashmir. He said that \"so far there are many areas which have not been reached\" by the army, but that military units were expected to reach all of them by the end of the day.\nThe quake was centered in the far-flung villages of the North-West Frontier Province, but it shook houses and high-rises throughout the region.\nMore than 1,600 were believed to have been killed in that province alone, the provincial police control room reported Saturday night. That toll includes an estimated 650 children who were killed in the collapse of three different schools.\nEstimates of the quake's magnitude varied from 6.8 to 7.8, with the United States Geological Survey putting the number at 7.6. Its epicenter was roughly 60 miles north of the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, where 20 \"significant aftershocks\" measuring between 5 and 6.2 magnitude were felt throughout the day on Saturday, Dr. Qamar-uz-Zaman Chaudhry, director general of the Meteorological Department in Islamabad, said by telephone on Saturday evening. Officials warned that serious aftershocks could continue for two days.\nThe earthquake, which sent tremors as far east as New Delhi, the Indian capital, and west to Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, was the biggest to strike the country in a century, Dr. Chaudhry said.\nThe top police official of the North-West Frontier Province, Riffat Pasha, said Saturday evening that the death toll there continued to rise and that relief efforts had been stymied by blocked roads and broken communication channels.\n\"The situation is very, very bad,\" he said. \"There are bodies lying everywhere. Those who have survived are lying in the open without food, shelter or medicine.\n\"The situation has been made worse by the rain and hailstorm that followed the earthquake,\" he continued. \"There is no way we can reach out to them.\"\nPrivate television stations showed images of leveled houses in the Pakistani side of Kashmir. Telephone lines remained down, and roads were blocked because of landslides. Torrential rain on Saturday evening was likely to impede relief efforts.\nIn the Indian-held section of the disputed Kashmir region, the death toll climbed to more than 240 by Saturday evening, including more than 30 Indian soldiers standing sentry at the disputed frontier. An untold number of houses were flattened, telephone lines and electricity were disrupted, and several roads were blocked by landslides, cutting the Kashmir Valley off from the rest of the country. The quake also destroyed a number of religious shrines, mosques and temples.\nThe death toll in Pakistan included 200 soldiers in the Pakistani-controlled section of Kashmir, Interior Minister Aftab Ahmed Sherpao said in a CNN interview.\nIn Rawalpindi, a school for girls collapsed, killing one child and injuring six, said Sheik Rashid Ahmed, the information minister.\nIn eastern Afghanistan, four children were crushed to death and a woman was injured as the mud walls of their homes collapsed. News from remote mountainous areas near the border with Pakistan could take days to reach the provincial capitals.\nIslamabad was in panic, and people spilled onto the streets. Traffic jams clogged roads, and residents huddled in groups outside houses, shopping plazas and government buildings. The cellphone network collapsed for at least 90 minutes.\nMargalla Towers, an upscale five-tower apartment complex, took the city's biggest hit from the quake. One tower collapsed, and part of another fell. Army and civil authorities reached the site within 30 minutes. Rescue workers estimated that at least 150 people, mostly women and children, were stranded under the rubble of the building.\nPresident Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan visited the apartment complex in Islamabad with Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz. General Musharraf expressed satisfaction with the rescue operation.\n\"It is a test for all of us,\" he said in an interview on state television. \"We are sure we will pass this test.\"\nIn Washington, President Bush expressed his sympathies for the victims of the earthquake. \"Our initial deployments of assistance are underway, and we stand ready to provide additional assistance as needed,\" he said in a statement. \"My thoughts and prayers are with those affected by this horrible tragedy.\"\nSecretary of State Condoleezza Rice also issued a statement, saying she had spoken Saturday morning with the foreign ministers of Pakistan and India to offer American help. \"At this difficult time, the United States stands with its friends in Pakistan and India, just as they stood with us and offered assistance after Hurricane Katrina,\" the statement said.\nThe quake occurred along one of the earth's great collision zones. The Indian subcontinent, including India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, rides on a separate tectonic plate that was attached to Antarctica until 150 million years ago. It broke away and moved north. About 50 million years ago, the plate slammed into Asia, and the buckling of earth created the Himalayan mountains. The Indian subcontinent continues to move north at more than an inch a year.\nA magnitude 6.2 earthquake in the same area in December 1974 killed 5,300 people. Because the quake on Saturday was shallow, 6 to 10 miles underground, the shaking on the surface was probably more intense than other quakes of its magnitude, said Waverly J. Person, a seismologist with the United States Geological Surveys National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo. \"These are the most damaging earthquakes,\" he said.\nBecause it occurred inland, there was no danger of it setting off a tsunami, as happened after the huge Indian Ocean quake in December. The deadliest recent quake in the region was in January 2001. It was centered in Gujarat in western India and killed about 20,000 people.\nAs for the earthquake on Saturday, no foreshocks gave any sign that a large quake was imminent; several large aftershocks, up to magnitude 6.3, came afterward.\nAt Margalla Towers in Islamabad, army troops and paramedics searched the rubble for survivors and made a human chain to clear the debris. Heavy cranes lifted slabs of concrete from the site.\nA man who identified himself as Masood and said he lived on the ninth floor of an adjacent building said he was asleep when the tremors rocked the building. He said he ran down all nine flights of stairs. \"It's a miracle that we survived,\" he said.\nTasawar Kamal, 29, who lives a half-mile from Margalla Towers, said his family rushed to the rooftop of a nearby apartment complex. \"From the rooftop, we saw the tower collapsing and immediately rushed here because our maternal uncle lives here,\" he said.\nTents were set up for people who had been evacuated from the nearby apartment blocks. Officials said they planned to bring dogs and heavy machinery to rescue people stuck in the basement of the collapsed building.\nA state of emergency was declared at hospitals in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. In Lahore, the capital of Punjab Province, two buildings collapsed in Shah Alami neighborhood. No casualties were reported.\nIn the North-West Frontier Province, Balakot, a picturesque tourist town, was among the communities that were leveled. In another town, Mansehra, officials said 70 percent of the houses had collapsed. Mushahid Hussain Syed, a senator, said, \"It is such a disaster, at such a big scale, that the whole nation has to be mobilized.\"",

    "text": "Live Clothed Girls May Be Stripped of Their Dance Jobs\n2005-05-02T05:00:00.000Z\nCorrection Appended\nMUMBAI, India, April 25 - At Azad Maidan, where Gandhi once led a sit-down strike against the British Empire, another act of civil disobedience is now unfolding, this time not for the sake of self-rule but for a woman's right to dance for a living.\nAt issue is the fate of a peculiar Mumbai-style cabaret known here as the ladies bar. The state has said it will close the bars on the grounds that they corrupt the young, destroy the family and promote prostitution. Their defenders, an odd mix of professional feminists and pistol-packing barkeepers, have put up a spirited fight, and their sit-down strikes on a dry dirt field have brought a daily parade of night crawlers -- dancers, bouncers, bar owners -- to squint and sweat under the midday sun.\nOne afternoon this week, a dancer who called herself Shoma and gave her age as 25 cooled off with a Popsicle and raged against the politicians threatening to take away her livelihood of six years. Her family eats because of her earnings, she said; her daughter attends a private school. \"Why is the government saying this now?\" Shoma asked. \"Maybe they want more money?\"\nThe ladies bars of Bombay, as this city is widely known, are a curious hybrid of Bollywood fantasy and an old South Asian palace tradition in which women sing and dance for men of wealth. These are not strip clubs: the women remain fully clothed, and the men are not allowed to touch them. They are not discos: the women dance, and the men can only offer cash from their seats.\nAt an upscale club on a recent Friday night, a dozen women in shimmering chiffon skirts swayed their hips, lip-synched and gazed at themselves in the mirrored walls.\nIf it were not for the men who crowded the seats along those mirrored walls, they could have been dancing in front of their bedroom mirrors, in preparation for the high school prom. The men, meanwhile, sat along the mirrored walls, nursing beer and whiskey, fanning out their money like cards on a blackjack table and tossing it at a favorite dancer.\nIn one corner of the bar, a man kept his attention and his money focused on a languid young woman in yellow. She moved to the music, threw back her hair, admired herself in the mirror and responded to his invitations to come closer, each time, fattening the stack of bills in her hand. In a high-society bar like this, on any given night, it is possible to take home over $100, an unimaginably handsome sum for a working woman in Mumbai. In less elite bars, a dancing girl is lucky to take home $10.\nThe crackdown on dance bars comes as the Bombay police step up a broader anti-sleaze campaign, tearing down movie posters, billboards and music videos they consider to be vulgar. The latest target was an advertisement featuring a man and woman in various compromising positions, competing for an ice-cream cone.\nSanjay Aparanti, the newly appointed deputy commissioner of police, calls it his personal crusade to rid Mumbai of what he considers the exploitation of women. \"Man has no right or reason to project women as a commodity,\" he declared in an interview in his office here the other day and then went on to compare the base nature of humans versus animals. \"In the animal kingdom, the female is respected. The lioness would sit with her cubs. The lion doesn't commit atrocities against her.\"\nThe dance bars, Mr. Aparanti said, are only an excuse for men to pick up women, stay out late and ultimately destroy the Indian family.\nSoliciting is not permitted in the dance bars, but it is understood that a man will try to get a woman's phone number, or try to invite her out for a meal, or perhaps then try to take her to bed. It is also understood that a woman's job is to milk his desire for as long as possible.\nAs for the lascivious gazes of the men, the dancing girls brushed them off as a fact of life in this trade, as in every other. \"This thing happens in an office, it happens in modeling,\" said a dancer who called herself Bobby. \"It's up to you.\"\nIn announcing the proposed ban earlier this month, R.R. Patil, the deputy chief minister of the state, told the state assembly that dance bars were \"corrupting the moral fiber of our youth and culture,\" according to a report published in The Times of India, the country's largest English-language daily.\nThe government has yet to formally ban the dance bars, and some speculate that a deal will eventually be brokered, particularly given that nearly everyone pockets something from the trade. One bar owner from a Mumbai suburb, where the state has already closed some dance bars, said he regularly paid more than $1,000 to police officers in his area each month.\nThe head of the Mumbai bar owners association, Manjeet Singh, a well-known loudmouth with two pistols tucked against his hip and a St. Bernard sweating at his side, said he would gladly, but openly, pay some amount to the governing party in exchange for a reprieve. He had already gone public with what he said were demands for cash from high-ranking politicians. \"It should be a policy of live and let live,\" he said.\nOne school of thought suggests that it was Mr. Singh's unbridled outburst that prompted the dance-bar ban. Others say it is a lowball political tactic by the ruling National Congress Party to appeal to the base of the Shiv Sena, its conservative, xenophobic opposition here -- a constant refrain in the argument against dance bars is that they promote the trafficking of foreign women, chiefly Bangladeshis.\nWhatever the roots of resentment, the threat of closing brought Shoma to the Maidan on a hot afternoon before work, after a two-hour train ride uptown. Shoma has been \"in this line,\" as she puts it, for over six years, and the story she tells about her entry is a familiar one in the industry: her husband died, her daughter's school fees had to be paid, her father needed costly surgery to remove his gallbladder. She gave up a job as a housemaid and started dancing. Even these days, when business is slow, her take-home pay is twice what she earned as a maid.\nAt 8 o'clock that night, as Shoma arrived at work, a Hindu hymn came blaring from the speakers, and the waiters stood around the dance floor, their hands clasped in prayer. At a giant altar behind the bar, incense was offered to the Hindu god Tirupathi. Business was slow, one of the waiters said. Prayers were needed.\nWhen the prayers were finished, the strobe lights came on and the waiters put on their ill-fitting double-breasted blazers. In a few minutes, a young woman in red walked to the middle of the room and lifted the dust from the dance floor to her forehead, in a gesture of prayer. Then she began to dance.\nMumbai Journal Correction: May 21, 2005, Saturday An article on May 2 about efforts by feminists, bar owners and employees in the Indian city of Mumbai to dissuade the government from closing a group of bars in which women sing and dance for the customers misidentified a Hindu god to whom incense was offered as employees began the evening with prayers. The god is Venkateswara, a manifestation of Vishnu, the second member of the Hindu trinity. (Tirupathi is the name of a town that houses a major shrine to Venkateswara.)",

    "text": "Trade Officials Haggle on Issues From Lower Tariffs to Cotton Subsidies\n2005-12-17T05:00:00.000Z\nHONG KONG, Dec. 16 - Trade negotiators from around the world moved behind closed doors in nearly around-the-clock meetings here as they homed in on reaching a narrowly worded four-part deal by Sunday night. But any agreement still faces formidable obstacles, officials said late Friday.\nAfter spending much of the first three days of the conference denouncing one another at dozens of separate news conferences, many ministers -- including Rob Portman, the United States trade representative -- suddenly canceled public appearances in favor of long discussions with other ministers.\nTrade ministers from 149 countries and customs territories are trying at the World Trade Organization conference to salvage a partial agreement. They are focusing on cutting taxes on poor countries' exports, liberalizing trade in cotton, ending agricultural export subsidies and linking lower tariffs for manufactured goods to lower tariffs for agricultural products.\nThe issue involving the greatest number of ministers lies in plans for rich countries to eliminate tariffs and quotas on imports from the world's 50 least developed countries. But complicating the deal is the fact that each rich country has some industry it would like to protect, like rice in Japan, or in the case of the United States, maintaining limited tariffs on textiles from Bangladesh.\nDipak Patel, Zambia's minister of commerce, trade and industry and the leader here of the coalition of least developed countries, said in an interview Friday night that discussions were focused on requiring each rich country to designate 90 to 95 percent of all categories of imports as free from tariffs and quotas for shipments from the poorest countries.\nBy comparison, the United States currently exempts imports from the poorest countries from tariffs and quotas in 83 percent of its more than 2,000 import categories. Japan exempts them for 87 percent of its import categories and the European Union exempts them from tariffs or quotas for all categories except sugar, bananas, rice and arms. But poor countries complain that many categories currently free from restrictions involve goods they do not produce, like jet aircraft.\nMr. Patel said that the least developed countries wanted more, notably a fixed date by which rich countries would move to allow duty-free, quota-free imports in 100 percent of their categories. Rich countries have only been willing to set this as an eventual goal.\nThe European Union also found itself beleaguered on Friday: criticized for not going far enough to liberalize agriculture and for going too far in pushing poor countries to let multinationals into their markets for services.\n\"The emerging direction of the meeting is worrying,\" said Peter Mandelson, the E.U.'s trade commissioner, who fretted that ministers were \"going backwards\" in focusing on a limited deal here instead of pursuing a more ambitious agenda.\nNonetheless, Pascal Lamy, the director general of the W.T.O., is coordinating efforts to reach the four-part deal. He has even been given the task by ministers of submitting draft language linking tariffs on manufactured and agricultural goods, and separate draft language setting a date, most likely 2010, for an elimination of agricultural export subsidies.\nBut achieving even this limited deal here could be difficult. Vested interests remain opposed to a deal on each of the pending issues. W.T.O. rules also give each member country and customs territory a veto that could bring proceedings to a halt.\nVarious countries have threatened to use their veto to support their objections to everything from American cotton subsidies and European sugar policies to banana exports from Central America.\nA particularly acrimonious dispute has broken out over the extent to which countries should be required to let foreign competitors into their markets for services like banking, telecommunications, hospital management and computer programming.\nAny narrow pact at the World Trade Organization ministerial conference here would leave even bigger issues to be resolved at a follow-up meeting, most likely to be held in Geneva in March or April. These bigger issues include global deregulation on a wide range of service industries, like banking and telecommunications; limits on trade-distorting domestic subsidies for agriculture; and reductions in agricultural tariffs and quotas.\nAmerican and African officials said that another issue under detailed discussion involved limits on American cotton subsidies. A W.T.O. panel ruled last spring that these subsidies violated international trade rules.\nWhile the Bush administration has been moving to adjust these subsidies, former French colonies in West Africa contend that the administration actions do not go far enough.\nThe United States has been trying to win African agreement to a plan involving the elimination of American tariffs and quotas on cotton imports together with technical assistance to improve the quality and quantity of cotton harvested in West Africa.\nFarms in countries like Chad, Mali and Senegal produce only half as much cotton an acre as American farms, and West African cotton tends to be low-quality varieties that American textile mills dislike.\nFrance and the European Union have energetically pushed the West African demands for a reduction in American cotton subsidies while opposing any further cuts in the European Union's domestic agricultural subsidies.\nW.T.O. members separately agreed in July 2004 to eliminate agricultural export subsidies. But the European Union has opposed setting any date for doing so until the United States pledges to cut its donations of free American-grown food to impoverished countries.\nThe European Union, the United States and India are also fighting an effort here by a coalition of developing countries including South Africa, Venezuela, Kenya and the Philippines that wants to limit multinationals' access to their services markets.\nThe South African-led campaign, which could yet derail the entire conference this weekend, involves requiring countries to negotiate each services agreement separately with each of the other members of the W.T.O.\nMr. Lamy has endorsed the faster approach instead of having groups of countries negotiate, but he has no power under W.T.O. rules to do anything more than make suggestions.\nSusan Schwab, the deputy United States trade representative, said that the talks about services markets were becoming abstruse even by W.T.O. standards.\n\"Would that we were negotiating about substance,\" she said with a note of exasperation. \"We're negotiating about negotiating.\"",

    "text": "New Pope's First Synod Confronts Array of Sensitive Issues\n2005-10-06T05:00:00.000Z\nROME, Oct. 6 - Over the last week, the serious shortage of Roman Catholic priests has dominated the first gathering of bishops under the new pope, Benedict XVI, with an openness and urgency that the Vatican was not used to under his predecessor, John Paul II. \n\"Celibacy has no theological foundation,\" Gregoire III Laham, who attended the synod as the patriarch of the Melkite Catholics, an Eastern rite church, said at an early session, official briefers reported. \"Married priests are admitted.\" \nAfter that potent bombshell, the Vatican cut back on the detail provided to reporters on the talks unfolding among 256 bishops, who came to discuss on-the-ground concerns from around the world. \nStill, it seems clear that the private deliberations in this first synod of bishops under Benedict - in office for six months now - mark a departure, even if the discussion is kept within relatively narrow confines. \nSince the synod opened on Monday, bishops have raised other sensitive and rarely aired issues - whether to allow communion to divorced Catholics who remarry without an annulment, and whether Catholics can vote for politicians at odds with church teaching on issues like abortion or euthanasia. \nThis broader discussion of church issues was encouraged by Benedict himself. But whatever taboos are being carefully cracked in this first synod, church experts caution that the chances that church policy on traditions such as priestly celibacy will be changed soon remain slim. \nSynods are, for one thing, purely consultative. So far, too, there has been little discussion of possible solutions, though the synod runs until Oct. 23. Further, while Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, before he became Benedict in April, allowed wide internal debate in his years as doctrinal enforcer, experts note that his decisions in the end often reflected some of the church's most conservative thinking. \n\"It's one thing to listen and to allow conversations,\" said Lawrence A. Young, an American sociologist who 20 years ago co-wrote, with Richard A. Schoenherr, one of the first scholarly examinations of the shortage of priests, \"Full Pews and Empty Altars.\" (University of Wisconsin, 1993). \"It's another thing to shift one's opinion vis-A\u0303 -vis key theology and church practice.\"\n Others are not so certain: Benedict, they note, is 78, a man who by his own admission may not have long in office and thus may move more quickly than a younger pope if he decides a problem needs fixing. In the meetings, he has shown up with a briefcase, not taking notes but listening intently with his chin on his hand, said an official church briefer. \n\"This pope is very astute, and I think he might be a surprise,\" said R. John Kinkel, a former American priest whose book, \"Chaos in the Catholic Church,\" (Random House, 2005) discusses the shortage of priests. \n\"It's sort of like the United States Supreme Court,\" Mr. Kinkel added. \"You get someone there and maybe they will do something you can't predict.\"\nThe topic of this first synod under Benedict is the Eucharist, the sacrament in which a priest consecrates communal bread and wine as the body and blood of Jesus Christ. It thus encompasses perhaps the most sacred rite of the church. \nBut at this synod, many bishops are asking a down-to-earth question: What value does the church place on communion if it does not have enough priests to distribute it regularly to the faithful?\n\"Let me make a confession here, and I know our canon lawyers will get mad at me,\" Bishop Luis Antonio G. Tagle of the Philippines, said at a news conference on Monday. \"The first Sunday after my ordination as a priest I said nine Masses, and that is regular in the Philippines.\"\nThe Vatican had already signaled that the shortage of priests was a major issue surrounding the Eucharist. A working document prepared for the synod noted that in 1978, there was one priest for every 1,797 Catholics. In 2003, it was one for every 2,677 Catholics. In the United States, it is one for every 4,723 Catholics. \nSome church experts predict that the shortage may become worse, especially in the United States, if the Vatican releases a long-expected document on excluding homosexuals, even celibate ones, from seminaries. \nLiberal Catholic groups were prepared for the shortage to come to a boil in this synod. Two of the most active groups, We Are Church and Future Church, said they had collected more than a million signatures asking the church to rethink issues like mandatory celibacy and the ban on women serving as deacons, the lay members who perform many functions of a priest. \nThe bishops themselves have made clear how deep a problem it is: On Monday, Bishop Roberto Camilleri Azzopardi of Honduras said that his diocese had only one priest for every 16,000 Catholics. \nBishop Lorenzo Voltolini Esti of Ecuador said that the number of people going to confession was dropping either because priests had little time or were not available. Confession is meant to cleanse souls so that people in serious sin can receive communion. \n Others say that the shortage of priests means that worshipers cannot receive communion every week. \n\"It is not possible to get it to everyone every Sunday,\" Bishop Theotonius Gomes of Bangladesh said in an interview between sessions. \"You try to get it to as many people as you can.\"\n In many places, lay people lead church services that are not actual Masses, and they cannot consecrate the bread and wine.\n Cardinal Angelo Scola of Venice, the church official leading the synod, has appeared to minimize the problem of a priest shortage, however. He said that Eucharist was a gift, not a right. \n\"The church is not a business that can determine in rigorous terms how many priests it needs,\" he said on Monday. \n But even if the problems seem clear to many bishops, the solutions are not. \nThe church has ruled out women as priests. Some liberal groups, who have little voice in the church anyway, are pushing to do away with mandatory celibacy - a position opposed by many others in the church as being contrary to longstanding Roman Catholic practice and theology. \n\"It's kind of a defining thing,\" Bishop Aloysius M. Sutrisnaatmaka of Indonesia said in an interview, adding that he would oppose any change in celibacy rules. \"It's a very spiritual thing.\"\nStill, there are already some exceptions: Eastern rite priests, and married Anglican priests who convert. Synod working papers note that many bishops are calling for a serious discussion of ordaining married men who have proven themselves in service to the church. \nIn the next two weeks, bishops will vote on the issues that most concern them and send their recommendations to Benedict. His own position is unclear, though he has said bluntly in the past that a shrinking church may be an irreversible trend. Still many experts say the hierarchy will have to confront the question or face a church with substantial changes. \n \"It's a bit like the church has decided to play the game of baseball but it's lost all of its pitchers,\" Mr. Young, the sociologist-author, said. \"You can go out and try to do that, and give it great thought and great reflection. But if you don't have that pitcher, it's not the same game.\"\nBrian Wingfield contributed reporting from Rome for this article.",

    "text": "Uninvited Guest Turns Up at Catholic Synod: Issue of Married Priests\n2005-10-07T05:00:00.000Z\nCorrection Appended\nROME, Oct. 6 - Under Pope John Paul II, the question was barely up for debate. But over the last week, the deep shortage of Roman Catholic priests has dominated the first gathering of bishops under the new pope, Benedict XVI, with an openness and urgency that the Vatican has not been used to in recent years.\n\"Celibacy has no theological foundation,\" Gregorios III Laham, who attended the synod as the patriarch of the Melkite Catholics, an Eastern Rite church, said at an early session, official briefers reported. \"Married priests are admitted,\" he said.\nAfter that bombshell, the Vatican cut back on the detail provided to reporters on the talks unfolding among 256 bishops, who came to discuss on-the-ground concerns from around the world.\nStill, it seems clear that the private deliberations of this first synod of bishops under Benedict, in office for six months now, are a departure, even if the discussion is kept within relatively narrow confines.\nSince the synod opened Monday, bishops have raised other delicate and rarely aired issues: whether to allow communion to divorced Catholics who remarry without an annulment, and whether Catholics can vote for politicians at odds with church teaching on issues like abortion or euthanasia.\nThis broader discussion of church issues was encouraged by Benedict himself. But whatever taboos are being carefully cracked in this first synod, church experts caution that the chances that church policy on traditions like priestly celibacy will be changed soon remain slim.\nSynods are, for one thing, purely consultative. So far, too, there has been little discussion of possible solutions, though the synod runs until Oct. 23. Further, while Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, before he became Benedict in April, allowed wide internal debate in his years as doctrinal enforcer, experts note that his decisions in the end often reflected some of the church's most conservative thinking.\n\"It's one thing to listen and to allow conversations,\" said Lawrence A. Young, an American sociologist who 20 years ago co-wrote, with Richard Schoenherr, one of the first scholarly examinations of the priest shortage, \"Full Pews and Empty Altars.\" \"It's another thing to shift one's opinion vis-\u00e0-vis key theology and church practice.\"\nOthers are not so certain: Benedict, they note, is 78, a man who by his own admission may not have long in office and so may move more quickly than a younger pope if he decides a problem needs fixing. In the meetings, he has shown up with a briefcase, not taking notes but listening intently with his chin on his hand, said an official church briefer.\n\"This pope is very astute, and I think he might be a surprise,\" said R. John Kinkel, a former American priest whose book, \"Chaos in the Catholic Church,\" discusses the priest shortage. \"It's sort of like the United States Supreme Court. You get someone there, and maybe they will do something you can't predict.\"\nThe topic of this first synod under Benedict is the eucharist, the sacrament of bread and wine in which believers commune with the body and blood of Christ.\nBut at this synod, many bishops are asking a down-to-earth question: What value does the church place on communion if it does not have enough priests to distribute it regularly to the faithful?\n\"Let me make a confession here, and I know our canon lawyers will get mad at me,\" Bishop Luis Antonio G. Tagle of the Philippines said at a news conference on Monday. \"The first Sunday after my ordination as a priest, I said nine Masses, and that is regular in the Philippines.\"\nThe Vatican had already signaled that the priest shortage was a major issue surrounding the eucharist. A working document prepared for the synod noted that in 1978, there was one priest for every 1,797 Catholics. In 2003, it was one for every 2,677 Catholics. In the United States, it is one for every 4,723 Catholics.\nSome church experts predict that the shortage may become worse, especially in the United States, if the Vatican releases a long-expected document on excluding homosexuals, even celibate ones, from seminaries.\nLiberal Catholic groups were prepared for the shortage to come to a boil in this synod. Two of the most active groups, We Are Church and Future Church, said they had collected more than a million signatures asking the church to rethink issues like mandatory celibacy and the ban on women's serving as deacons, lay members who perform many functions of a priest.\nThe bishops themselves have made clear how deep a problem it is: on Monday, Bishop Roberto Camilleri Azzopardi of Honduras said his diocese had only one priest for every 16,000 Catholics.\nBishop Lorenzo Voltolini Esti of Ecuador said the number of people going to confession was dropping either because priests had little time or were not available. Confession is meant to cleanse souls so that people in serious sin can receive communion.\nOthers say the shortage means that worshipers cannot receive communion every week. \"It is not possible to get it to everyone every Sunday,\" Bishop Theotonius Gomes of Bangladesh said in an interview between sessions. \"You try to get it to as many people as you can.\"\nIn many places, lay people lead church services that are not actual Masses, and they cannot consecrate the bread and wine.\nCardinal Angelo Scola of Venice, the church official leading the synod, has appeared to play down the problem of a priest shortage, though. He said the eucharist was a gift, not a right.\n\"The church is not a business that can determine in rigorous terms how many priests it needs,\" he said Monday.\nBut even if the problems seem clear to many bishops, the solutions are not.\nThe church has ruled out opening the priesthood to women. Some liberal groups, which have little voice in the church anyway, are pushing to do away with mandatory celibacy -- a position opposed by many others in the church as being contrary to longstanding Roman Catholic practice and theology.\n\"It's kind of a defining thing,\" Bishop Aloysius M. Sutrisnaatmaka of Indonesia said in an interview, adding that he would oppose any change in celibacy rules. \"It's a very spiritual thing.\"\nStill, there are already some exceptions: Eastern Rite priests, and married Anglican priests who convert. Synod working papers note that many bishops are calling for a serious discussion of ordaining married men who have proved themselves in service to the church.\nIn the next two weeks, bishops will vote on the issues that most concern them and send their recommendations to Benedict. His own position is unclear, though he has said bluntly in the past that a shrinking church may be an irreversible trend. Still, many experts say the church will have to confront the question or face a church with substantial changes.\n\"It's a bit like the church has decided to play the game of baseball but it's lost all of its pitchers,\" said Mr. Young, the American sociologist. \"You can go out and try to do that, and give it great thought and great reflection. But if you don't have that pitcher, it's not the same game.\"\nCorrection: October 13, 2005, Thursday An article on Friday about a new openness in discussion of church issues at a Roman Catholic synod in Rome referred incorrectly to the status of deacons. They are considered clergy members with restricted functions, not members of the laity.",

    "text": "New Imam Calls for Help in Catching Bombers\n2005-07-09T05:00:00.000Z\nLONDON - The new imam at the Finsbury Park mosque, once a hotbed of radical Islam, had a message for those who gathered for prayer on Friday, a day after four bombs killed at least 49 people: help identify the bombers, he told them. Show your anger at what happened here.\nHis call to cooperate was a stark and deliberate contrast to a former imam, Abu Hamza al-Masri, now detained and facing extradition to the United States to face terrorism-related charges. Under his leadership, the Finsbury Park mosque became a recruiting center for jihadists for holy wars from Bosnia to Afghanistan.\nIt is that image the residents of this North London immigrant neighborhood are working hard to shed, eager to demonstrate to an increasingly anxious country that they are not to blame for the attacks on Thursday and that Finsbury Park has rid itself of extremists.\nAlready, residents here were bracing themselves, fearing they would become targets. \"It'll soon be 'kick-a-Muslim week' if we don't watch out,\" said one young man who declined to give his name. Already, there have been some retaliatory acts against Muslims in Britain.\nThe struggle in Finsbury Park reflects the broader divide between two Muslim worlds in Britain -- the majority of moderates and the radical Islamists who live among them. For years, a relatively small band of radical Islamists hijacked Finsbury Park's image and threatened its economic rejuvenation.\nBut the moderates are reclaiming the mosque. They installed a new board of trustees who brought in the new, moderate imam. The mosque now offers a course on Islam for non-Muslims. The neighborhood's other, smaller mosque has thrown open its doors in an aggressive program to show London and the world that they do not harbor terrorists. It holds regular \"open mosque weekends,\" in which all comers are invited to tour the mosque, watch videos about its charitable programs and eat from a buffet of halal food.\n\"When we held our last one in May, 1,200 people came,\" said Fadi Itani, the younger director of the smaller mosque, standing in the courtyard hung with banners advertising another open-mosque weekend in July.\nA stream of Muslims, many in conservative Islamic dress, streamed into the square concrete mosque's small courtyard on Friday from a busy street of brick storefronts.\nLike most moderate Muslims, Mr. Itani expressed a weary frustration about the latest attacks. \"As a Muslim, to be honest, I've had enough,\" he said.\nIn many ways, Finsbury Park is a microcosm of Britain's Muslim community: a traditionally immigrant neighborhood that has housed Irish and Italians as they arrived and moved up in British society. It was largely inhabited by Pakistani and Bangladeshi immigrants by the 1960's. In the 1970's, they bought a row of dilapidated houses on Saint Thomas Road and transformed them into an Islamic community center and later tore down the houses to build a four-story red-brick mosque.\nBy the late 1990's, North African Arabs arrived, many of them fleeing Algeria's bloody civil war between Islamists and the country's military-backed secular government. Among them came dozens of Muslim extremists, and within a few years, they took over the Finsbury Park mosque, which was riven by leadership squabbles. As imam, they brought in Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, better known as Abu Hamza al-Masri, an Egyptian-born fundamentalist preacher known for his extremist anti-Western views.\nThough his following was small, Mr. Mustafa's presence loomed over the neighborhood and fragmented the community.\n\"Most of us went to the other mosque,\" said Mounir Kirati, who arrived as an Algerian refugee in 1998, as he made his way back from prayers. \"We didn't like their interpretation of Islam.\"\nMuhammad Ali, a bearded man in a brown robe, said the extremists' presence had cast a pall over the economic revival that the neighborhood is undergoing. Nearby Blackstock Road, lined with shuttered shops 20 years ago, is now bustling with Algerian-owned cafes and Somali-owned telephone shops.\nThe police raided the Finsbury Park mosque in January 2003, and Britain's moderate Muslim community leaders orchestrated Mr. Mustafa's ouster.\n\"That place is now safe in the hands of mainstream Muslims,\" said Ahmed Sheik, president of the Muslim Association of Britain, which helped install the mosque's new board. \"We have no fear of the radicals coming again.\"\nThe Finsbury Park mosque cannot prevent Muslims with extremist beliefs from coming to pray, but they can no longer use the premises for other activities, said Muhammad Kozbar, the new secretary of the mosque's board of trustees. As proof that the mosque has been reclaimed, he said the average congregation for Friday Prayer has tripled from what it was in its radical days.\n\"The extremists are a very tiny minority,\" said Talal Karim, who served for 20 years in the local government responsible for Finsbury Park. \"The moderate majority has outmaneuvered them.\"\nBut the frustration of the community is growing as evidence mounts that Muslim immigrant citizens or the children of immigrants in Europe are increasingly populating the rank and file of terrorist organizations. Of 140 people implicated in European terrorist activities since 1993, 24 percent were European nationals, according to a study by Robert S. Leiken and Steven Brooke at Washington's Nixon Center, an independent think tank.\nFor many Muslims here, condemning terrorism does not mean condoning American or British policies.\n\"It is correct to say Islam forbids the killing of civilians, but we need to have a larger discussion about why these actions happened,\" said Imran Waheed, spokesman for the British branch of Hizb ut-Tahrir, a global Islamist party working for the return of an Islamic caliphate, whose activists handed out leaflets outside the Finsbury Park mosque as people left Friday Prayer. \"What we want is equity or parity between the life of a Briton in the suburbs of London and a farmer in Iraq,\" he said.\nOpposition to Britain's role in Iraq has turned the area's Muslim community away from the governing Labor Party and toward the upstart Respect Party of George Galloway, who issued a statement Thursday saying that his party had warned that the war in Afghanistan and Iraq would increase the threat of terrorist attack in Britain.\nMassoud Shadjareh, chairman of Britain's Islamic Human Rights Commission, argued that injustice lends legitimacy to extremist discourse.\n\"There needs to be a separation between those who are committing those atrocities and those who are passionate about injustice,\" he said, adding that dismissing extremists outright only isolates them and makes them more likely to turn to violence. \"We need to encourage that passion and give them avenues within the civil society to deal with injustices.\"\n\"We have far greater experience as victims of terror than as perpetrators of terror,\" said Mr. Waheed of Hizb ut-Tahrir, saying that the community's reaction to the killing of Muslims in Afghanistan and the Middle East has been \"remarkably restrained.\"\n\"People need to understand the feeling on the Muslim street,\" he said. \"People hate the foreign policy of Britain and the United States, and the West needs to consider whether constant interference in the Muslim world is productive.\"",

    "text": "A Textbook Case of a School in a Spiral\n2005-02-20T05:00:00.000Z\nIt is 1965, and the brick walls of St. Teresa elementary school, in an area of Queens once known as Irishtown, are bursting at the seams. Fifty-four boys crowd into Sister Mildred Marie's sixth-grade classroom, while her counterpart, Sister John Marie, rides herd over 46 sixth-grade girls. Enrollment has just hit a new high of 1,000.\nNow it is 2005, and St. Teresa's, population 176, is all but an educational ghost town. The peeling red \"SILENCE\" sign hanging in the stairwell seems superfluous. There are 19 children in the sixth grade. Next year, there will be none.\nBy now, the whipsawing forces that led the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens to announce the closing of 22 schools this month, a forced contraction unprecedented in the annals of New York City Catholic education, are familiar.\nEnrollment is down, after decades of flight from the boroughs by the Irish- and Italian-American Catholics who built the parochial school system. The growing shortage of priests and nuns has robbed the schools of their source of cheap labor, driving tuitions up, and in turn driving enrollment down, driving tuition higher still.\nBut questions remain. How did the broad social changes play out at these particular schools? Why now, after years of decline, did the diocese, and in this case the school, conclude that the situation was beyond help?\nUnlike many parishes in the diocese, St. Teresa's, in Woodside, is not flat broke, at least not yet, and has never gone begging to the diocese for money. And unlike many of the other parishes that are losing their schools, St. Teresa's, a pocket of small brick houses and apartment buildings a half-mile square, is still home to plenty of Catholic school-age children -- probably more than a thousand, census figures show -- 350 of whom attend the church's Saturday catechism classes.\nBut the bottom line is the same as elsewhere, said the school's principal, Martin C. Abruzzo.\n\"The enrollment drives the financial picture,\" he said in his office last Wednesday, \"and unless we have something to back that financial pool, then the operation must cease to be.\"\nMr. Abruzzo, who has run St. Teresa's for 30 of his 66 years, made a face as if he had tasted ashes. \"I hate calling it an operation,\" he said. \"It's a living organism.\"\nThis is the story of the birth, life and death of one school, an attempt to make one closing more comprehensible, if not less painful. It may hold some lessons applicable in some ways to the other 21 elementary schools that will be closed and the 125 in the diocese that will remain open, many of them challenged within an inch of their lives.\nBefore there was St. Teresa's parish or St. Teresa's Church, there was St. Teresa School.\nIn the 1920's, northwest Queens was booming. The Woodside and Corona subway line, now known as the No. 7, was up and running, and Irish families by the score fled the slums of Manhattan to move out to \"the country.\" The parish in Woodside, St. Raphael's, needed a school, and decided to build a mission school half a mile east of the church. St. Teresa, a four-story brick-and-white fortress on 44th Street off 50th Avenue, named for the newly canonized Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux, opened its doors to 200 students in 1927. On Sundays, the school doubled as a church. Mass was said in the basement.\nAfter the lean years of Depression and war came the baby boom, and Woodside exploded again. St. Raphael's built another school and St. Teresa's became a full-fledged parish with its own church in 1950. Even with other new schools opening around St. Teresa's, the supply of Catholic schoolchildren seemed limitless, said Msgr. Denis Herron, pastor of St. Teresa's.\n\"When people were moving they'd first look to see if you could get into school before they bought the house,\" he said. \"People would ask the principal and he'd say, 'No.' Then they'd ask the pastor and he'd say, 'We'll try to sneak them in.' That's how you would end up with class sizes that people now would think are insane.\"\nBy 1965, Monsignor Herron said, every inch of available space had been given over to general classrooms, including the old worship hall in the basement that had become the school's gym.\nOne member of the class of 1965, Michael J. Hardiman, said that when there was a fire drill, the children filled the sidewalks on both sides of the school, all the way up to 50th Avenue. The school employed not just a nurse but a doctor and a dental hygienist. All while charging tuition of just $40 a year, in part because 19 of the 22 teachers were nuns, Dominican Sisters of Sparkill, but mostly because healthy parish collections paid for the running of the school.\nDuring the late 1960's and 70's, as the baby boomers moved on to high school and the Irish migrated again, to the suburbs, enrollment at St. Teresa fell slowly but steadily, by about 30 students a year. At the same time, the nuns, who worked for stipends of a few thousand dollars plus room and board, were growing scarce. By 1970 they were outnumbered at the school by lay teachers.\nIn 1972, the school levied its first major tuition increase, to $325 from $80 a year. Enrollment dropped by 80 students the next school year.\nWhen Mr. Abruzzo arrived, in 1975, St. Teresa was down to its last nun. The church fathers asked at his interview if he felt he could keep the school open another five years. Enrollment continued to drop, so tuition kept going up. Mr. Abruzzo said that the trend, while unhappy, did not seem fatal. \"I thought it would level off,\" he said. St. Teresa added music and art programs and started a kindergarten and a pre-K, which slowed the drain.\nBy 1992, the school was down to 275 students; not many, but at an average of 27 students per grade, enough to keep things running.\nBy then, Woodside was filling up again, this time with a new crop of working-class immigrants from every corner of the globe: Bangladesh, Korea, the Congo and all over Latin America. For financial and cultural reasons, not many of them sent their children to St. Teresa, but enrollment finally stabilized, and for the rest of the 1990's, it hovered around 265. Tuition was gradually increased to $2,500 a year.\nThen in 2000, enrollment tumbled again. Now there were fewer than 250 students. Mr. Abruzzo, who acknowledges that he knows more about educating children than about marketing, said he was not too worried. \"I thought it would level off again,\" he said. It didn't. From 2001 to 2002, the enrollment fell to 205 children from 239.\nSt. Teresa's was running out of wiggle room.\nMr. Abruzzo went to the 2002 National Catholic Education Association conference in Atlantic City to attend workshops on marketing and development.\nThe mood, Monsignor Herron recalled, was growing tense. \"You're sort of heading toward Niagara Falls,\" he said, \"and you say, 'We've got to turn this around, we've got to turn this around.' But it keeps getting closer and closer.\"\nIn 2003, Mr. Abruzzo said, \"We went from a bleed to a hemorrhage.\" Many families who had lost jobs after the 9/11 attack were moving out of the area. Only 165 children signed up for school.\nDrastic measures were in order. St. Teresa's raised tuition by $500, to $3,800 a year. Parents were enlisted to beat the bushes. They printed up fliers. They staked out corners near the public schools. \"We stood a respectable distance away,\" said Monica Markowitz, head of the Parents Guild, and buttonholed other parents dropping off their children. They held fashion shows to raise money.\nIn the spring, St. Teresa's held a Discovery Day in the school gym to let the community know about the school. \"We advertised, we prepared, we decorated,\" Monsignor Herron said. Perhaps 20 people showed up.\nIn October 2003, a new bishop, Nicholas A. DiMarzio, was installed in Brooklyn and put more pressure on the failing schools.\nIn November 2003, an Alumni Day drew 1,200 sons and daughters of St. Teresa's from as far as California. They donated more than $30,000. \"Ordinarily you don't expect any kind of contribution from elementary school alumni,\" Mr. Abruzzo said.\nBut it was easier to attract people from across the country than from across the street. \"When we did exit interviews,\" he said, \"people were moving out of the neighborhood, out of the state or out of the country.\"\nFollowing the lead of a handful of other schools in the diocese, St. Teresa's made a $170,000-a-year deal with the city's public schools to rent out its ground floor to Public School 199, whose building nearby was bursting its seams just as St. Teresa's had decades before. St. Teresa's also tapped the parish coffers for a big contribution, $117,000, for the first time in a very long time.\nRegistrations for the 2004 school year actually ticked up, thanks in part to generous scholarships given by alumni. But a future could not be sustained.\nA few months ago, Mr. Abruzzo ran some projections. \"Next year, to get back on our feet\" and meet a million-dollar budget, he said, \"we'd need $500,000, maybe $600,000. Then we would need it again the following year.\"\nMr. Abruzzo passed the information on to the diocese. Early in February, Michael Hardiman, class of 1965, now the diocese's vicar of education, called St. Teresa's to break the news that his alma mater would close. \"It was not an easy call to make,\" he said. \"The school has been part of my life.\"\nWhile St. Teresa's current students are all promised spots at St. Raphael's School in neighboring Long Island City, the future of the building, which is owned by the parish, is unclear.\nAt midday on Wednesday, Mr. Abruzzo, a jowly man with bushy, arched eyebrows, left his small yellow office for a brief tour of the school.\nHe stopped by a second-grade classroom to hear the children recite their pre-lunch prayer. He paused in the hall to greet Dr. Elizabeth Lutas, a cardiologist who visits the school one week a year with her model eyeball and inner ear to teach the children anatomy.\nDown a long dim hallway with linoleum floors the color of raw salmon, he pointed out a statue of St. Teresa herself.\nHe swung through the ground floor, where the air buzzed with five classrooms of kindergartners from P.S. 199, a reminder of the untapped market.\nMr. Abruzzo returned to his office. It is no longer exactly a seat of power. He has no idea what he will be doing come September. He says he cannot afford to retire.\nWhich reminded him. \"Here's something,\" he said, and picked up a fax that had come the day before from a school in Forest Hills. The letterhead was in Hebrew.\n\"To Whom it May Concern,\" the fax said. \"We are sorry to hear that your school is merging with another school. Perhaps we can help. If you have any teachers who are looking for a job in a private school, elementary or middle school, we have positions available.\n\"Sincerely,\" it was signed, \"Rabbi David Abramchik, Principal.\"\nPrincipal Abruzzo smiled ruefully. \"At least someone cares,\" he said. \" I don't know what they'll pay. But I'll send in a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\"",

    "text": "Finally, a Confirmation of a Rebound\n2005-11-06T05:00:00.000Z\nCorrection Appended\nIF there was a precise moment when Newburgh's fortunes turned the corner, when the long-awaited revival of this hard-luck Hudson River city finally kicked into high gear, it might have been at 5:40 a.m. on Oct. 17.\nThat's when the ferryboat West New York set off on its inaugural trip to meet a Metro-North Railroad train on the opposite bank, in Beacon, that would take passengers to Grand Central.\nFor Newburgh residents, the ferry shaves 12 minutes off the morning commute, but also reconnects their city, in northern Orange County, to its historic waterfront. And this detail, like Newburgh's affordable homes, exquisite architecture, spectacular views and pioneering spirit, is yet another reason, residents say, to root for its recovery.\n\"We were drawn to the grittiness,\" said Rachel Andrews. In October, Ms. Andrews and her fianc\u00e9, Shad Haque, who works as a systems analyst in New Jersey, paid $225,000 for an 897-square-foot two-bedroom, two-bath condo in a half-renovated former factory up the hill from the ferry landing.\nMs. Andrews, a performance arts teacher who works on the Upper East Side, takes the boat each day to get to work. And, she said, commuting by water provides huge bonuses. \"You can feel the stress of the day blowing out of your hair,\" Ms. Andrews said.\nAnd even though the work-in-progress condition of her building can sometimes be vexing -- ice-machines for refrigerators used to be manufactured inside, and to this day, the hallways in the unfinished half have thick wood beams and scruffy concrete floors -- she said it's a huge improvement on her former home in Rockland County, where she and Mr. Haque lived on a quiet street in a split-level ranch. \"We love that it's not suburbia,\" Ms. Andrews said.\nWhat You'll Find\nBy most measures, Newburgh is definitely not suburban.\nInstead of predictable, look-alike homes, the city offers a hodgepodge of Italianate row houses, Second Empire mansions and Gothic castles -- even a 35-acre park designed by Frederick Law Olmsted -- much of it squeezed into a 445-acre, 2,440-building historic district, one of the state's largest.\nYet alongside these treasures, often just an alley away, are many buildings that are jarringly derelict, their windows sealed with cinder blocks. Indeed, crime in Newburgh continues to be a problem, though much less so than in previous years.\nIn 2004, there were two homicides, down from seven in 2002, according to Deputy Chief of Police Michael Ferrara, while drug arrests dipped from 438 in 2002 to 354 in 2004.\n\"Yes, this city needs constant attention,\" Chief Ferrara said. \"But we're making it a miserable place for drug dealers to live.\"\nUrban pioneers are reclaiming these bombed-out properties, and scaffolding is a common sight.\nEven outside the city's dense core, there's a whir of construction activity. Along the river, mega-mansions are springing up on hillside lots.\nIn Balmville, a leafy hamlet of the town of Newburgh, century-old Tudor mansions are hidden behind hedges. Nearby, the 123-year-old Powelton Club, with a stately slate-roofed clubhouse as its centerpiece, is a country club that offers golf, tennis and two pools.\nWhat You'll Pay\nThe rise in home prices has been rapid, easily doubling in three years. A typical home -- that is, a 3,500-square-foot, three-story attached row house -- would have cost $250,000 in 2002 but could be $500,000 today, said Leina Kofsky, a broker with Mason Samett Associates.\nBut even with the gains, prices are lower than in the Hudson River towns of Peekskill, Nyack or Beacon.\nStill, the market in Newburgh may be softening.\nIn May, Kiki Hayden, an associate broker with John J. Lease Realtors, listed, for $795,000, a Queen Anne brick mansion on prestigious Montgomery Street that was built in 1890 for a president of the Erie Railroad. It has seven bedrooms, six-and-a-half baths and seven fireplaces, though none have been used in years.\nThe house, zoned to accommodate three families, served as a bed-and-breakfast business called the Stockbridge Ramsdell House on Hudson until last summer. Most of the bids Ms. Hayden got on the house, however, were low, so in early October she reduced the asking price to $775,000. It is still on the market.\n\"Customers are more cautious, especially with the cost of heating homes this size,\" Ms. Hayden said. \"They're out there and looking, but they're taking their time.\"\nThe range in home prices can be stark. At the lowest end are $30,000 shells with no power, water, full roofs or complete floors. They can be bought from the city, which has 213 buildings in its possession, about 3 percent of the city's tax roll. The city ended up with them through either tax foreclosures or repossessions from owners who promised, but failed, to rehabilitate them.\nBut as these burned-out homes are bought and improved, the city is revaluating them, pushing property taxes up by 40 percent, residents say.\nAt the high end are homes like the ones rising in the Anchorage, a 21-lot development in Balmville, where a 5,900-square-foot home with five bedrooms on 1.3 acres is listed for $1.75 million.\nFar more typical is a home like 162 Grand Street in town, listed for $425,000 and currently under contract. Built in 1884, the 4,300-square-foot, three-story home has eight bedrooms and four baths on a tenth of an acre, with on-street parking but sweeping river views -- and with much original woodwork and plaster refurbished in an extensive renovation by the current owners.\nWhat to Do\nFor now, Newburgh's night life is split in two. One part is the slowly gentrifying area on Liberty Street, south of Broadway, which is the city's ragged commercial strip. Cafe Macchiato, a nine-month-old Italian restaurant owned by Brooklyn transplants, presents documentary films on Thursday nights and jazz bands on Fridays.\nThe other social hub is the waterfront, between the railroad tracks and the river, redeveloped five years ago into a tidy row of restaurants, shops, an art gallery and apartments. On the last weekend of every month during warmer months, local artists line up along the docks to show off their work.\nSeparating the two is a grassy bluff where tenements stood before a much-maligned, late-1960's urban-renewal project ripped them down. To knit together the halves, the city is expected to choose a developer by year's end to build stores and apartments on the 30-acre site, according to the Department of Planning and Development.\nOthers head out of town for their cultural fix, to the Storm King Art Center sculpture park to the south, or the Dia:Beacon art museum across the Hudson.\nStill, many people stick around for the second Sunday in December, which is when Newburgh holds its annual Historic House Tour, scheduled this year for Dec. 11. Typically, a dozen homeowners, mostly downtown, will open their doors to the general public.\nThe Schools\nServing 2,700 students, Newburgh's public school system, which has nine elementary schools, three junior high schools and a high school, is in a state of transition.\nA recently approved $50 million bond act will help address leaky roofs and classroom overcrowding. But more long-term challenges include raising the current graduation rate of 65 percent, said Annette Saturnelli, the superintendent of schools. Under a new rule, any would-be dropout must first have a face-to-face meeting with her.\nFor students in the class of 2004 who took the SAT reasoning tests, average scores were 475 on the verbal, compared with 497 statewide, and 485 in math, compared with 510 statewide.\nAnother challenge facing Newburgh's school system is how to handle a huge immigrant population, a mix of ethnicities that includes students from Colombia, Bangladesh, Honduras, Albania and Yemen, but mostly Mexico.\nIn fact, Spanish is the primary language for 10 percent of Newburgh's students. Bilingual instruction is provided from kindergarten through senior year.\nThe Commute\nPassenger trains have not stopped in Newburgh since World War II, so the Beacon station is the closest place to catch a train to Midtown, about 70 miles away.\nDrivers, meanwhile, praise the fact that Newburgh sits at the junction of the New York State Thruway and Interstate 84. By car, in an hour, you can be in Manhattan, Pennsylvania or Connecticut.\nYou can also venture much farther afield, courtesy of the five-year-old Stewart International Airport, which is on a former Air Force base four miles southwest of downtown.\nThe History\nDuring the American Revolution, George Washington set up camp for a year and a half on the Hasbrouck farm in Newburgh. Whoever controlled this section of the Hudson River, the thinking went, could defeat the British, who were determined to invade Connecticut from here and then shut down the rebel stronghold of New England.\nIn addition, Newburgh's deep river waters and gently sloped banks always made it an ideal place in the 1800's for ships to dock and load up on vegetables bound for New York City. With the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825, boats laden with grain from the Midwest also dropped anchor.\nToday, tankers carrying gasoline still ply the Hudson's waters off the banks, but the ships that stop in the port nowadays tend to be pleasure crafts, some recreating the canal boats' routes.\nWhat We Like\nFor anybody who has ever wanted to live in an old mansion but could never afford one, Newburgh offers many options -- especially if the homeowner has a knack for a hammer and band saw. And, despite sometimes decades of neglect, many homes retain period details like stained-glass windows, marble mantels and plaster medallions.\nIn fact, a home buyer's first stop after signing the deed is typically the historical society, according to Pat Favata, the society's librarian, to track down photographs or descriptions of the original house, to get the details right.\nWhat We'd Change\nNow that crime rates are dropping, many residents want the police in Newburgh to crack down on quality-of-life crimes. On some blocks, garbage is strewn across the sidewalks and discarded furniture lies in piles on the curb.\nLiving In | Newburgh, N.Y. Correction: November 20, 2005, Sunday The \"Living In \" article on Nov. 6, about Newburgh, N.Y., misstated the number of students in the Newburgh Enlarged City School District, which also encompasses New Windsor, N.Y.

    "text": "Saudi Arabia Looks Past Oil in Attempt to Diversify\n2005-12-13T05:00:00.000Z\nRIYADH, Saudi Arabia - The ultimate oil state is seeking to shift its economy away from oil.\nSaudi Arabia may be experiencing its third oil boom in three decades but it is also undergoing an economic revolution that its leaders hope will finally insulate it from the oil producer's curse: the next price collapse.\nThe Saudi kingdom remains the 600-pound gorilla of the global oil market. Given its vast reserves, Saudi Arabia can keep pumping oil for the next 70 years. Oil, along with Islam's holy cities, Mecca and Medina, provides the country's rulers with wealth, power and influence. Oil sales account for 40 percent of the economy and about 90 percent of government revenue. But that reliance on a volatile commodity -- with big booms but also big busts -- is also a problem that the royal family is determined to overcome.\nThe nation's leaders, of course, have made similar vows before to translate their vast oil wealth into a more diversified economy. Will this time really be different?\nThere are signs that it may be. Unnoticed by many outsiders, the Saudi private sector has flourished in recent years, thanks to structural changes started by King Abdullah in the late 1990's when he was crown prince and oil prices were at $10 a barrel.\n\"There's a gold rush in Saudi Arabia right now,\" said Mohammed al-Sheikh, a Saudi lawyer associated with the White & Case law firm here in Riyadh, the capital. \"You can feel it everywhere in the economy. Everyone wants to invest here.\"\nDriven by a construction boom that is already replacing many of the buildings thrown up in the 1970's, sprawling shopping malls, paved with white marble and featuring Gucci stores and Starbucks coffee shops, have become fixtures of the landscape in Riyadh, Khobar and Jeddah.\nAnalysts at the Samba Financial Group in Riyadh expect the economy to grow by 6.5 percent this year thanks to record oil prices, which have helped fuel the third consecutive year of rapid expansion. But the private sector, which also stands apart from the state-run oil industry, has outpaced the rest of the economy for 7 of the last 11 years and is expected to grow 7.4 percent this year.\n\"The diversification of our national income and our economy away from oil is key to our well being,\" said Abdullah Alireza, a minister without portfolio and a member of the Supreme Economic Council. \"It's absolutely key.\"\nThe Saudi stock market has become one of the world's top performers, and growth in its market value for this year is about twice as large as the country's oil revenues.\nSaudi Arabia is also opening to real competition. It joined the World Trade Organization on Sunday after 12 years of negotiations, a move expected to give a powerful push to the country's private sector.\n\"It's going to be a long road to bring ourselves up to international standards,\" said Fouad al-Humoud, a local businessman, sitting in his office in the center of this sprawling city, at the end of a long strip of neon-lighted stores. \"But we have a tsunami of opportunities here. No one wants to be left on the back seat.\"\nThe government has relaxed foreign ownership laws, loosened credit rules, liberalized the telecommunications market, passed a new capital markets law and created regulatory agencies to oversee these changes.\n\"That's a structural shift,\" said Brad Bourland, chief economist of Samba. \"In terms of reforms, this is where the rubber meets the road, because it creates a regulatory environment where a private economy can operate.\"\nUnlike in the oil booms of the past, Saudi companies are the main beneficiaries of today's bonanza. Major local industries, like petrochemicals, mining, plastics or fertilizers, have been created from scratch. Sabic, the Saudi Basic Industries Corporation, is now the largest nonoil company in the Middle East; Ma'aden, the government-owned mining company, is not far behind.\n\"They feel the need to develop industries that create added value and jobs and develop fields where they have a natural advantage,\" said Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Seznec, a professor at the Middle East Institute of Columbia University.\nAbdallah Dabbagh, the president of Ma'aden, told a group of reporters on a recent visit here that within 10 to 15 years he expected Saudi Arabia to dominate the fertilizer business. \"The world will depend on Saudi Arabia for its food the same way it depends on its energy today,\" he said.\nThat's an exaggeration, but Saleh al-Husseini, a member of the Majlis al-Shura, a consultative assembly appointed by the king, claims that the current boom is more sustainable than past oil-led expansions.\n\"Saudi businessmen have gained a huge experience since the first oil boom,\" Mr. Husseini said.\nLike most oil producers, Saudi Arabia has found that oil was as much a curse as a blessing. In the 1970's, the state modernized rapidly; built roads, schools, hospitals and universities; and gave safe government jobs to its people. But when energy prices collapsed, the state found it could not pay all its bills.\n\"They have learned the lessons from the first and the second oil booms,\" said El-Mostafa Benlamlih, the resident coordinator for the United Nations here. \"These had lots of redistribution, lots of consumption, lots of public sector recruitment and lots of waste. I don't think they'll go down that road anymore.\"\nThis year, analysts estimate the kingdom will earn between $150 billion and $160 billion from oil sales, a figure exceeded only in 1974 and the early 1980's. Thanks to its budget surplus, the government raised public salaries by 15 percent, for the first time in two decades; it also laid out a more smartly devised $8 billion public works program to build roads, schools and hospitals over the next five years.\nThe oil wealth is also trickling down in the economy and spreading beyond the elite. While vast disparities in wealth persist, economic output per person is expected to reach $13,600 this year, after averaging $8,000 throughout the 1990's.\nBut mostly, the windfall has been used to improve public finances significantly. Debt as a share of annual economic activity has been cut to 51 percent, down from 119 percent in 1999. At the same time, the government has bolstered its foreign reserves, which now total $177 billion, including $135 billion held by the central bank, according to Samba. Five years ago, foreign holdings totaled less than $70 billion.\nThis kind of management has even earned Saudi Arabia kudos from the International Monetary Fund, which recently praised the government's \"prudent macroeconomic management, the effective use of oil revenues to invigorate the development of the private sector and the economy's impressive performance.\"\nThe privatization of Saudi Telecom, at the beginning of 2003, shook the stock market's lethargy and set off a trading frenzy that has not slowed since. Public offerings of insurers, banks and a mobile phone company have led to a doubling this year of the market's value, after gains of 85 percent in 2004 and 76 percent the year before.\nWith a total capitalization of $620 billion as of November, the market is now larger than Spain's or South Korea's. More than $4 billion changes hands every day on the Riyadh exchange, twice as much as in Hong Kong, according to Timothy S. Gray, the managing director for investment banking at HSBC Saudi Arabia.\nIn contrast to the old handouts, stock-buying has become a principal means for sharing the bounty more widely. \"They have used I.P.O.'s of public companies to disseminate the wealth to the little guys,\" Mr. Gray said. \"In a country where only the big guys used to benefit, it's not an unreasonable objective.\"\nThe most remarkable aspect of the stock market's performance is that it happened without Saudi Aramco, which remains a government-run concern. Bankers here expect that oil-related projects like the giant refinery venture between Aramco and Sumitomo of Japan might eventually sell stock to the public.\nTo be sure, the government has not deserted its oil sector. It plans to inject some $50 billion into it by 2009 to increase production and build refineries.\nSome analysts also suspect that Saudi Arabia, to help balance the budget and sustain the economy, is seeking higher oil prices than it had in the past. Since the price collapse of 1998, the country's oil minister has ruthlessly enforced discipline within OPEC, taking the reins of the oil cartel and setting a more active policy.\nWhile OPEC has not identified a new price to defend, analysts believe the so-called floor might now be in the $40 to $45 range.\n\"We'd like to achieve rapid economic growth,\" said Amr Dabbagh, the governor of the country's foreign investment agency, the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority. \"Unless our economy grows twice as fast as our population, we'll have a challenge.\"\nAchieving that kind of growth might be a challenge in itself. More than two-thirds of all Saudis were born since 1975 and the country, with a population of 17 million, has one of the world's highest population growth rates. Male unemployment, according to Samba, is about 9 percent.\nYet Saudi Arabia still relies on legions of foreign workers -- from India, Bangladesh, the Philippines and Arab countries like Syria or Egypt -- who number six million.\nThey fill both low-paying and midmanagement jobs that Saudis either shun or are not trained to do. Getting more Saudis into the work force, a goal of a government \"Saudization\" program, would first mean overhauling the education system, which is run by the religious establishment and provides little practical training for the real world.\nAsem Arab, an economics professor at the King Saud University of Riyadh, also runs a consulting firm with 20 employees. He acknowledged the problem he faced in filling jobs with Saudis. He said most of his employees were from Egypt, Syria or Jordan, and added: \"We have eight Ph.D.'s, eight master's and just four Saudis.\"\nThe economic debate is taking place against the backdrop of a battle against home-grown radicals. Paramilitary police patrols and random checkpoints have become a common sight in the capital and other cities, along with heavy security, makeshift concrete barriers and machine-gun-equipped jeeps guarding most ministries, city landmarks and hotels frequented by foreigners.\nWhile no major terrorist act has occurred in nearly a year, leaders here hope that creating jobs will serve as the most effective counterpoint to the recruiters of Al Qaeda.\n\"You have a young and growing population, but I don't think they are as angry as they used to be,\" said Mr. Sheikh, the lawyer. \"One of the fundamental reasons of their anger was economic, and the economic situation has improved drastically.\"",

    "text": "Dress Like Your Dad? He Rocks\n2005-12-01T05:00:00.000Z\nDEBORAH DEJAH, a New Yorker and the mother of two, has long shared her daughter's tastes in music. Now she shares her dress size too. So it was probably inevitable that Mrs. Dejah, 48, and Olivia, 14, would find themselves at Marsha D. D., a Third Avenue store specializing in children's fashion, squeezing their diminutive frames into identical Doors T-shirts, the image of Jim Morrison emblazoned on the front.\nThe Dejahs' infatuation with the accouterment of classic rock 'n' roll does not stop there. Olivia makes regular forays into her mother's closet, ferreting out the old T-shirts, frayed jeans and weathered cowboy boots that were once the emblems of her mother's renegade look, hoping they will lend a subversive edge to her own.\nMrs. Dejah is thrilled. \"These clothes resonate from your childhood,\" she said. \"That you could share them with your kid is really wonderful.\"\nIt is also fashionable, perfectly in tune with the current revival of an old-school aesthetic founded on the relics of classic rock's glory days, an era roughly from the mid-1960's through the early 70's. In the last year or two, the trappings of that raucous era have acquired a mass appeal, recycled or reinvented for a candidly nostalgic age.\nRock's funky, flamboyant aesthetic has been part of the cultural landscape for so long that to some it may not register as new. But the look is now being revisited simultaneously by a young generation enchanted with rock's golden age and by their parents, many of them seeking to reconnect with their past lives.\nA high-low roster of retailers -- including Fred Segal, Bergdorf Goodman and Barneys New York; vintage shops like Cherry and Resurrection; and youth-driven chains like Urban Outfitters and Hot Topic -- have added components of classic rock style to their inventories. That stock encompasses original and contemporary variations of Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin T-shirts; biker and cowboy boots and winkle-pickers; low-rise drainpipes and patched and shredded denim flares; Sergeant Pepper-style marching band coats; glitter tops; and faux folkloric tunics worthy of Janis Joplin or Stevie Nicks.\n\"Rock 'n' roll is part of everybody's uniform right now,\" said Jaye Hersh, the owner of Intuition, a popular Los Angeles boutique and Web site selling rock-inflected items like studded belts and newly minted concert T-shirts, even baby onesies imprinted with an AC/DC logo.\nAspiring hipsters of any age can buy their rock paraphernalia from mass marketers like H&M, which is selling skinny black velvet jackets reminiscent of Mick Jagger's; companies like Trunk, a maker of reissued concert T-shirts; or catalog merchants like Worn Free, which publishes a promotional gazette styled like an alternative newspaper, advertising a \"heritage line\" of clothing bearing images of Frank Zappa and John Lennon. \"This is rebellion made ready-to-wear,\" the catalog copy boasts.\nThose who like their look raw and authentic flock to shops like Resurrection in the East Village, a purveyor of used concert shirts, leather jackets and accessories priced from $200 to several thousand dollars. For older shoppers, high prices are no hurdle. \"They are buying all those things that they wanted as a kid, that they didn't get to have,\" said Katy Rodriguez, an owner of the shop.\nOthers turn to eBay, which reports a recent run on vintage pieces like hardware-embellished hipster belts, motorcycle jackets, leather wristbands, old concert T-shirts and Nike sneakers customized with a portrait of Bob Marley.\nLast month Cherry, a boutique in Greenwich Village and Los Angeles that sells vintage rock clothing to the fashion set, opened an outlet at the Virgin Megastores in Times Square and in Los Angeles, an indication that the music emporium, which sells new band T-shirts and accessories to teenagers and young adults, has made a commitment to the old-time style.\nEd Baker, a student from England, strolled inside Virgin's Cherry shop in Times Square on Tuesday and gazed longingly at an olive drab field jacket, an artifact from his father's time. \"My dad was a Mod back in the day,\" Mr. Baker, 23, said. \"He rode scooters and stuff, and he was fond of the Beatles, the Stones and the Who.\"\nThat his father might have worn one of the styles on display \"is definitely part of the appeal for me,\" he said.\nShoppers partial to more lacquered rock interpretations can wait until early next year, when spring fashions from houses like Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, Undercover, Balenciaga and Dior Homme begin trickling into stores. In her men's show in February, Rei Kawakubo, the Comme des Gar\u00e7ons designer, introduced a procession of suits and shirts gaudily done up with the Stones' famous lips-and-tongue logo. Undercover, an influential women's line by Jun Takahashi, includes playful riffs on the concert T-shirt, sliced up and reassembled as A-line dresses, tunics and hip-wrapped skirts.\nRock's stylistic revival comes at a time when the signature music of the 60's and 70's reverberates in the popular consciousness by way of made-for-TV movies and books, the latest including \"The Autobiography of Donovan: The Hurdy Gurdy Man,\" out this week from St. Martin's Press. Boomers with families in tow have packed a recent run of concerts, including the Stones, who performed in New York City in September, and Cream, who reunited for a three-night blockbuster at Madison Square Garden in October. A Times Square billboard trumpets the 1971 \"Concert for Bangladesh,\" now on DVD.\nIt was only a matter of time before the wholesale commercialization of classic rock would find a new outlet in fashion. That old-school style is \"valid today,\" said David Wolfe, the creative director of the Doneger Group, which forecasts retail trends. \"It is very much a part of our time, being adopted by a younger generation looking for a way to rebel within the boundaries being set by mainstream society.\"\nLisa Koenigsberg, an adjunct professor of arts at New York University and the founder of Arts Initiatives, which organizes conferences on the arts, observed that rock's raw style is just as potent a magnet to the middle-aged. \"It conjures an Arcadia, a time when the boomers felt they could change the world,\" she said.\nMs. Koenigsberg, who will preside at \"Dressing the Part,\" a New York University conference that runs today through Saturday and addresses the allure of rock style, added that for parents and children alike, that style \"represents a narrowing of the bridge between the generations, a visual argument that both are on the same page.\"\nThe appeal of rock fashion lies primarily in its authenticity. \"It's not about taste,\" argued the aptly named Mick Rock, who has been photographing rock bands since 1969. \"It's more about energy. These are people very involved in their own style. Quite often they are self-styled. They are pulling together unlikely elements, and it's their attitude that makes them work.\" An exhibition of Mr. Rock's photographs opens today at the gallery in the Soho Grand Hotel in Manhattan.\nParadoxically, a denatured, stylized version of the look prevails on the runways and in fashion glossies. This month Harper's Bazaar features a homage to the likes of Patti Smith, Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin using designs from Yves Saint Laurent, a look that is anything but gritty.\n\"Rock is not destroyed anymore,\" said Julie Gilhart, the fashion director of Barneys, where best sellers include glamorized versions of the classic biker's boot. \"It's cleaned up. Everything is done with such precision that you're going to look as if you thought about it long and hard.\"\nAt Bergdorf, which does a robust business with Chrome Hearts rock-inspired accessories, shoppers have embraced the tough-as-rivets look as a complement, or sometimes an antidote, to the prim runway fashions of the last several seasons. It appeals to \"luxury customers who do not necessarily want to look as if they are conforming,\" said Robert Burke, the store's fashion director.\nMrs. Dejah, the mom who shops at Marsha D. D., is among those likely to incorporate the look into a more refined ensemble, pulling on a Stones T-shirt, for instance, to punch up a fastidiously tailored blazer and black pants. \"Rock is not my whole look,\" she said. \"If I have to do something grown-up, I'll make some adjustments.\"\nAnd Bergdorf's interpretation of classic rock will not be literal, Mr. Burke said, but will highlight hard-edged elements from the collections of Alexander McQueen and Dsquared, a mix intended for customers who want to roughen up and lend ballast to the season's wispy doll-like looks.\nToday rock style is increasingly pitched to an audience grown comfortable with its casual if somewhat mannered appearance. \"Formality doesn't really exist in everyday fashion like it did in the times of our parents and grandparents,\" said Cesar Padilla, an owner of Cherry. \"That's why the things we take for granted -- denim and leather and boots -- which were embraced by the rock movement, have become part of modern street chic.\"\nNor will the sight of a baby boomer tricked out in leather and flares raise many eyebrows, Mr. Padilla added. \"In the 60's, if you had a record executive walking around in a Sonic Youth T-shirt, you would have thought he was out of his mind.\n\"But today it's O.K. for a 50-year-old to wear a Sonic shirt, because everybody in Sonic Youth is 50 years old.\"",

    "text": "Who's Afraid of Sarah Schulman?\n2005-10-23T05:00:00.000Z\nCorrection Appended\nSEVERAL days a week during the school year, the novelist and playwright Sarah Schulman takes a subway, a ferry and two buses to get from her cramped sixth-floor walkup in the East Village to a cramped classroom at the College of Staten Island, where she is a tenured professor of English. Her students this semester -- as many as 40 in each class -- include Italian-Americans, African-Americans, Yemenis, Dominicans, Haitians, Lebanese, Azerbaijanis, Bangladeshis, Chinese, Koreans, Russians, Albanians from Albania and Albanians from Kosovo. \"Some can barely read out loud, and some know five languages,\" Ms. Schulman said. In any case, she learns their names by the second week and also what they mean.\nIf Ms. Schulman works so hard to reach her students, perhaps that's in part because the world, as she sees it, has not always done as much for her. She has not, for instance, been as successful as she feels she deserves to be. Oh, she's been recognized; her seven published novels and two works of nonfiction have won many awards (she was a finalist for the Prix de Rome), while her playwriting has earned her most of the plum residencies and fellowships available. But there is still that sixth-floor walkup and that two-hour-each-way commute and the constant effort to get theaters to mount her work, while some writers she considers her peers struggle far less and have, she says, \"more personal choice about which of their plays will be produced.\"\nMs. Schulman feels there's a simple reason she isn't among them: she's a lesbian who writes openly about lesbians in an industry largely run by men. \"Often, works that reinforce dominant fantasies about oppressed people are inflated beyond their merit,\" she explained in an e-mail message, judiciously omitting the names of the works she meant. Whereas works like hers, she said, address oppression from a \"more authentic perspective\" and are therefore ruthlessly marginalized.\nThough her speech is armored with jargon, the effect is often mitigated, in person, by her almost maternal warmth. In private, she has been a loving mentor to many young writers, feeding them encouragement and home-cooked meals. Even during our interview, she occasionally took my hand to emphasize an important point, and spoke in a modest whisper. Still, I found myself repeatedly preparing to flinch as she stalked me for bad motives, tired agendas and prejudices; when she thought she spied one she pounced as if to drag it from behind some trees and let it rot in the sun.\nThis was Ms. Schulman in her holy terror mode, scaled down for the diner where we were talking. In public, her attacks and pronouncements have made her a controversial figure. She paints herself as a nearly solitary pioneer in advancing lesbian theater. (\"I am trying to achieve something that has never been done before,\" she wrote in another e-mail message.) After a discussion among leading gay writers at a national conference, people who were in attendance say, she stood up from the audience and directly challenged the panelists (she says she spoke calmly), demanding to know what they personally were doing about the lack of lesbian plays in production in America. A perfectly reasonable -- even important -- issue, though antagonizing your allies is not always an effective strategy.\nBut then, Ms. Schulman apparently doesn't think gay male writers are necessarily her allies. As for the success that some of their work has found with mainstream audiences, she seems to regard it as almost a point against them: \"Quality has never been the determining factor in terms of recognition and rewards,\" she said. \"Not in any field. When great work is successful, I believe it's a coincidence.\"\nHer fearlessness has won her a reputation for difficulty (which she dismisses as mere \"rumor\") and may have impeded her progress in the insular and touchy theater world. Certainly her plays -- serious reflections on life at the margins, frequently experimental in structure or satirical in tone -- have not achieved the acclaim of her fiction. Her novels are published by major houses and reviewed respectfully. (Of her book \"Rat Bohemia,\" Edmund White wrote, \"The force of her indignation is savage and has blown the traditional novel off its hinges.\") Her plays, on the other hand, have until recently been produced at \"rat-infested parking lots\" or downtown dives with names like University of the Streets and Women's One World. They have received a few mainstream reviews, ranging from scornful (\"a talking poster\") to glowing (\"every line will ring true\"), but have mostly been ignored.\nBecause she finds that intolerable -- \"Respect is my Achilles' heel,\" she said -- and because she is very smart, Ms. Schulman set out quite deliberately, around 1994, to beat the system. And now, at 47, after an \"an 11-year-crawl,\" she finally seems poised for a substantial breakthrough. Her new play, \"Manic Flight Reaction,\" which is in previews at Playwrights Horizons and opens on Oct. 30, wraps a typically serious Schulman theme (the need to take responsibility for the pain you cause others) in a delightful premise: a young woman discovers that her mother's ex-lover is now the wife of a Republican presidential candidate. Will she be outed? It's a surprise to find Ms. Schulman working this comic vein; the set could pass for the living room on \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show.\" But even more so, given Ms. Schulman's reputation for ideological absolutism, it's a surprise to see her slyly question the assumptions of all the characters: not just obvious bad guys but also the delightful main character, Marge, a 50-ish lesbian academic described in the stage directions as \"struggling to settle -- at the last minute -- into normalcy, but lovingly.\"\nThat \"lovingly\" is perhaps emblematic of Ms. Schulman's new stance. She sees herself as a judicious artist and thoughtful \"participant citizen\" whose public controversies are behind her -- and were, at any rate, provoked. Certainly that was the case when she discovered that a significant part of the story of \"Rent,\" Jonathan Larson's 1992 musical, bore a striking resemblance to her 1990 novel, \"People in Trouble.\" Though a separate plagiarism charge brought by the show's dramaturge was settled out of court, Ms. Schulman never sued, instead seeking justice in print. In her 1998 book, \"Stagestruck: Theater, AIDS and the Marketing of Gay America,\" she offered a blistering critique of the musical -- and of the elites who lionized it while ignoring her.\nIf \"Stagestruck\" tends toward overstatement, it may reflect Ms. Schulman's days as an early and ardent member of Act Up. And the overstatement does make for enjoyable reading -- or did until I discovered myself in its pages, appearing in the minor role of Another Ineffectual Journalist, flapping with fear instead of standing up for truth. Though the particulars are debatable, I had to admit that the scene played well; Ms. Schulman is a natural dramatist. The only really bothersome thing was that, of all the pseudonyms in the world, she had to saddle me with \"Seymour.\"\nIn that, I got off lightly. Though she won't discuss them, her feuds and pyrotechnic fallings-out are well known. No one I contacted would comment on the record, except to praise her as an artist. (\"I wish her nothing but success, she truly deserves it,\" the playwright Craig Lucas said.) It's hard to know how many of these relationships foundered on professional instead of personal shoals; in any case, Ms. Schulman laughed when I told her how much she is feared. Their fear, she said, is actually anger: the anger of privileged people being forced to question the source of their privilege. \"Anyway,\" she said, making an incredulous face, \"what can I do to these people?\" Apparently she meant what could she do beyond attacking them in public and alluding to them unflatteringly in her novels and plays. Two of the less likable characters in \"Manic Flight Reaction\" clearly allude to -- or are named for -- former friends.\nMs. Schulman says she is merely \"bold,\" and it's true that her exploits and self-regard might seem dashing in the story of a male literary lion. It may even be a sign of perverse integrity that she doesn't tone it down with people who can help her. Tim Sanford, who as artistic director of Playwrights Horizons produced her first uptown play, \"Carson McCullers (Historically Inaccurate),\" said that Ms. Schulman was \"so hungry for encouragement\" back then that she would become \"combative.\" \"She is a great scholar, a social analyst,\" Mr. Sanford said. \"You see it in her plays. It's wonderful even if it's a little crazy and provocative. But sometimes she'll spin something I've said to such a degree it's borderline offensive. Over time I've learned to just say: 'That's outrageous! Why are you antagonizing me?' But the thing I love about her is that she's candid, always. I do love that. Maybe not everyone would.\"\nThough some at Playwrights were leery of taking on \"Manic Flight Reaction\" after their previous bouts with Ms. Schulman, Mr. Sanford said (and others agreed) that the experience had been entirely positive and had vindicated his faith in her. She made revisions as asked and even cut jokes when the director, Trip Cullman, suggested they weren't landing. Ms. Schulman attributed the change in tone largely to Mr. Sanford's willingness to learn from her: \"After so much interaction about lesbian representation, he became more open to certain themes, and he was also more willing to let me know what he wanted from me,\" she explained. Mr. Sanford pointed to Ms. Schulman's own education in the realities of theater. \"It's really been her focus as a writer to take on the skill set of a more accessible Off Broadway playwright,\" he said. \"Basically, to move uptown.\"\nThat skill set is in part technical. Ms. Schulman said that because she had never completed a writing course, let alone a graduate degree, she had little knowledge of the basics. But the political skills needed to maneuver in the uptown theater were even harder to master. \"It was a whole new industry that I didn't know how to operate,\" she said. \"I didn't know who was who and I wasn't used to the way people in that world behaved -- which is antisocially.\" By which she meant, among other things, that \"theaters do not prioritize their responsibility to serve the vast, diverse array of life experiences that take place every day in New York City. I wasted a lot of time figuring it out and making mistakes.\"\nBut that effort, she said, has been worth it. Artistically, she has emerged from the process as \"a senior writer with a very wide palette\" who can handle, she added, \"pretty much anything.\" She now has nine plays in various stages of development; it is perhaps most telling that one of them, a 1920's farce called \"The Lady Hamlet,\" will have its first reading, starring Kate Burton, on Thursday at the New York Theater Workshop -- where the reviled \"Rent\" originated.\n\"I had my say and they got their money and life goes on,\" she said, shrugging. \"What can you do?\"\nIf Ms. Schulman is trying to put her past behind her, it's a difficult past to dismiss. She has, she said, \"suffered from other people a lot.\" The outlines of an awful upbringing are easily discernible in some of her novels, and many of her friends died of AIDS. She does not like to discuss any of this, except through her work; as a typically pithy line in \"Manic Flight Reaction\" has it: \"When people find out that something truly horrible has happened to you, they show no mercy.\" Nevertheless, she feels optimistic, rather like her character Marge, struggling to settle into normalcy at the last minute.\nAs all writers must, she denied the autobiographical element, except for the part about Marge having lived for too many years in a sixth-floor walkup. But for anyone who has followed Ms. Schulman's career or been on the wrong side of her disapproval, \"Manic Flight Reaction,\" with its handsome production, possible commercial future and almost reconciliatory ending, is a kind of road map and a relief.\n\"I never thought that being out in my work would have the financial consequences that it has had,\" she said. \"I thought that the world would evolve in such a way that people would appreciate the boldness of my content, and be able to see clearly my scope of craft and palette. I really never thought that having integrity about the content and perspective of my work would keep people from being able to accept what a good writer I am. My deepest, most optimistic hope is that we are finally at a place where this recognition can happen.\"\nWell, perhaps it's not her very deepest wish. Upon reflection she agreed that tops on her list would probably be an elevator.\nManic Flight Reaction Playwrights Horizons Opens on Oct. 30 at the Peter Jay Sharp Theater/Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton.\nTHEATER Correction: November 6, 2005, Sunday An article on Oct. 23 about the playwright and novelist Sarah Schulman, who has said that Jonathan Larson plagiarized her novel \"People in Trouble\" for his musical \"Rent,\" referred incorrectly to an unconnected lawsuit by the musical's dramaturge, Lynn M. Thomson, that was settled out of court. It was a claim of partial authorship; it did not involve plagiarism.",

    "text": "One Muslim's Odyssey to Guant\u00e1namo\n2005-06-05T05:00:00.000Z\nBREMEN, Germany - About two months after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001, the Pakistani police picked up Murat Kurnaz, a 19-year-old Muslim from Germany who was traveling by bus near the city of Peshawar.\nThe police turned Mr. Kurnaz, a Turkish citizen born in Germany, over to the American military in Pakistan, who in turn transferred him to Afghanistan, and he was held as a terrorist suspect.\nMr. Kurnaz, it seemed, had chosen a poor time to go to Pakistan, just as the American war against Al Qaeda and the Taliban was getting started. Could he have been a Muslim fighter, recruited to help the enemy? The fact that he was a religious young Muslim from this city in northern Germany, only an hour's train ride from Hamburg, where the main plotters of the Sept. 11 attacks had lived, apparently supported the American suspicions that he was.\nIndeed, Mr. Kurnaz's lawyer in the United States said that interrogators in Afghanistan seemed convinced that he was an associate of Mohamed Atta, who is believed to have piloted one of the hijacked planes flown into the World Trade Center.\nThough no link to Mr. Atta was ever found, Mr. Kurnaz was sent to the American prison camp at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, where he has been held for about three years now as an enemy combatant, specifically accused of being a member or ally of Al Qaeda or its terrorist network. The evidence against him is that, while he was traveling in Pakistan, he was the guest of a militant Islamic group said to have supported terrorist acts against the United States.\nIn addition, Mr. Kurnaz was known to have intended to travel to Pakistan with a close friend, Selcuk Bilgin, another Turkish citizen from Bremen. And Mr. Bilgin, according to an American military tribunal's findings on Mr. Kurnaz, later carried out a suicide bombing.\nBut in recent months, as details of the charges against Mr. Kurnaz have come to be known, German officials here in Bremen who have investigated both Mr. Kurnaz and Mr. Bilgin have reacted to the American conclusions about Mr. Kurnaz with astonished incredulity.\nThe most striking element in the picture is that, contrary to the American assumption about Mr. Bilgin having carried out a suicide bombing, the Germans say that claim is demonstrably false.\n\"He lives here,\" Uwe Picard, the Bremen criminal prosecutor who carried out the German investigation into Mr. Bilgin, said in an interview in his office here. \"He is still alive.\"\nMoreover, even American documents indicated that much of the evidence on Mr. Kurnaz actually seemed more to exonerate him than to incriminate him. The decision of the three-member Guant\u00e1namo tribunal that found Mr. Kurnaz to be an enemy combatant last September refers to classified material in his file and indicates that that is where the reputed links to Al Qaeda would be documented.\nBut a Federal District Court judge, Joyce Hens Green, in reviewing Mr. Kurnaz's case early this year, found that there was only a single document, called R-19, that incriminates Mr. Kurnaz as a member of Al Qaeda. About this material she concludes, \"Not only is the document rife with hearsay and lacking in detailed support for its conclusions, but it is also in direct conflict with classified exculpatory documents.\"\nJudge Green's summary of the classified file was briefly unclassified earlier this year and reported on by The Washington Post in March. It contained several intelligence reports that exonerated Mr. Kurnaz of the very charges the Guant\u00e1namo tribunal made against him.\nThere is one report by the Command Intelligence Task Force, the intelligence unit of the Southern Command whose responsibility includes Guant\u00e1namo, that said, \"CITF has no definite link/evidence of detainee having an association with Al Qaeda or making any specific threat against the United States.\"\nYet, Mr. Kurnaz remains in detention in Guant\u00e1namo, and the three-member Combatant Status Review Tribunal that heard his case last year concluded, \"By a preponderance of the evidence, Mr. Kurnaz meets the criteria to be designated as an enemy combatant.\" It is a designation that means in theory that Mr. Kurnaz can be kept in prison until President Bush declares that the campaign against terrorism is over.\nAsked the reasons for the determination in the Kurnaz case, a Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Alvin Plexico, said, \"The bottom line is that we have a Combatant Status Review Tribunal to review all this information, and they have come to the conclusion that he is an enemy combatant, and they are certainly in a better position to judge than you and I are.\"\nBut an investigation of Mr. Kurnaz's case reveals no evidence that he ever fought against the United States or planned to.\nThough Mr. Kurnaz was born in Bremen he has remained a Turkish citizen because his parents, who came to Germany as guest workers from Turkey more than three decades ago, never became German citizens.\nHe grew up in Bremen in a largely secular Muslim family. But when he became 17 or 18, Mr. Kurnaz became more religiously observant, his mother, Rubiye Kurnaz, said in an interview in his lawyer's office in Bremen. He grew a beard, she said, and began going to a largely Arab mosque, rather than the Turkish mosque that his family attended. He also began to criticize other members of his family for what he saw as their lack of piety.\nThree weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Kurnaz decided to go to Pakistan. The purpose of his trip, according to his German lawyer, Bernard Docke, was to deepen his knowledge of Islam. Mr. Bilgin intended to accompany him on this trip.\nAs things turned out, Mr. Bilgin was stopped from leaving Germany by the border police because he had failed to pay a fine for an unrelated misdemeanor. According to Mr. Picard, the prosecutor, when the police called Mr. Bilgin's family to see if the fine could be paid so Mr. Bilgin could leave, one of the family members said that they did not want him going to Pakistan for fear that he would join a Muslim group there fighting against the United States.\nIt was this comment that prompted Mr. Picard's investigation into Mr. Bilgin and the Abu Bakr mosque that he and Mr. Kurnaz attended.\n\"Of course, we were concerned with the possibility that Murat Kurnaz had been radicalized by a preacher at the mosque,\" Mr. Picard said. According to some officials, German intelligence has identified one member of the Abu Bakr mosque as having recruited fighters for pro-Qaeda groups, which would seem to justify an effort to find out if Mr. Kurnaz was one of them.\nBut Mr. Picard said his investigation of the mosque, which included interrogations of the suspected recruiter and a search of his home, produced no evidence of terrorist connections or of any attempts to recruit Muslims there to fight against the United States.\n\"We get rumors sometimes that they preach hatred there,\" Mr. Picard said of the Abu Bakr mosque. \"But there is no proof.\"\nThough Mr. Bilgin was prevented from leaving Germany, Mr. Kurnaz did go to Pakistan on Oct. 3, 2001. About three weeks later, he was arrested by the Pakistani police in a routine check of a passenger bus near the northern city of Peshawar. According to Mr. Docke, the Pakistani police held Mr. Kurnaz for about a week and then turned him over to the American military in Pakistan. From there, Mr. Kurnaz was taken to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan and eventually transferred to Guant\u00e1namo, where he has been since.\n\"For us what is very important,\" Mr. Docke said, \"is that he had no weapons when he was arrested, that he was arrested in Pakistan, not on the battlefield in Afghanistan, and he was arrested by the Pakistani police during a routine check of a bus.\"\nBut his very presence in Pakistan raised suspicions among American military interrogators, and so did the fact that, by his own account, he was the guest in Pakistan of an Islamic group, Tablighi Jamaat. The group, which is based mostly in Pakistan and Bangladesh and keeps up an energetic fundamentalist missionary drive in many European countries, was described by the Guant\u00e1namo tribunal as a supporter of terrorism. That link, and Mr. Kurnaz's association with Mr. Bilgin, are the two unclassified charges made against him to support the tribunal's conclusion that he is an \"enemy combatant.\"\nFurthermore, the tribunal's findings listed no particulars of how Tablighi Jamaat is thought to have supported terrorism against the United States. Some experts say it has no record of supporting terrorism or Islamic militancy, but others have said it supported the mujahedeen fighting Russians in Afghanistan and aids Muslim separatists in Kashmir. The tribunal's decision on Mr. Kurnaz only refers to the fact that he received free food, lodging and schooling from the group.\nAs for Mr. Kurnaz's travels from mosque to mosque in Pakistan, some people who make such trips come into contact with more militant schools of Islam, and counterterrorism experts have noted that some of those who are attracted to the group move on to more militant groups.\nBut one expert on Tablighi, Jamal J. Elias, a professor of religion at Amherst College, wrote in a letter that Mr. Kurnaz's travels were exactly the sort of activity that the group undertakes in its efforts to encourage greater Muslim piety and that nothing he was reported to have done with the group indicated that he was being recruited as a terrorist.",

    "text": "Hunger for Energy Transforms How India Operates\n2005-06-05T05:00:00.000Z\nCorrection Appended\nNEW DELHI, June 1 - Fed by a decade-long economic boom, India's ever-growing appetite for energy is quietly reshaping the way it operates in the world, changing relations with its neighbors, extending its reach to oil states as far flung as Sudan and Venezuela, and overcoming Washington's resistance to its nuclear ambitions.\nHovering over India's energy quest is its biggest competitor: China, which is also scouring the globe to line up new energy sources. The combined appetite of the two Asian giants is raising oil prices and putting greater demands on world oil supplies.\nAlready India's energy ambitions have led to developments unthinkable just a couple of years ago: a proposed pipeline to ferry natural gas from Iran across Pakistan; a new friendship with the military government in gas-rich Myanmar, formerly Burma; and budding talks with the United States to let India buy nuclear technology.\nNuclear power is expected to top the agenda when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visits Washington to meet with President Bush in July. While India covets new equipment to strengthen its feeble nuclear energy program, the United States has prohibited the sale of nuclear technology to India since it tested a nuclear bomb in 1998.\n\"International cooperation, international understanding of India's nuclear ambition,\" Mr. Singh told foreign journalists on Monday, in an allusion to what New Delhi wants from the United States, \"can help to ensure our nuclear energy program moves forward at a faster pace.\"\nTo understand India's dire need for energy, consider the fate of its commercial capital, Mumbai, formerly Bombay. It was enveloped in darkness in May because of a severe power shortage.\nThese days, the prime minister is engaged in a politically explosive argument with left-wing parties after suggesting that the government curtail giving free electricity to farmers. As the world's fifth-largest consumer of energy, India used energy at the equivalent of 538 million tons of oil daily in 2002, the most recent year for which figures were available from the International Energy Agency. That demand is expected to nearly double by 2030.\nToday, India imports about 70 percent of its oil; in another 20 years, the Indian government estimates, that will rise to an ominous 85 percent. India's demand for natural gas is also expected to grow, and most of it would have to be imported.\n\"Our dependence is rising,\" Mani Shankar Aiyar, India's petroleum minister, said during a recent interview in his office. \"I welcome that, because it reflects India moving on.\"\nIndeed, it is. \"Mutual dependencies\" is the buzzword of the day, signaling the way oil and gas links among South Asian countries stand to rewrite the enmities of the past. \"The foreign policy of India will have a lot to do with energy,\" said Ashutosh Varshney, a political scientist at the University of Michigan. \"That is a new imagination and one likely to stay.\"\nThat vision is not without its challenges. On the one hand, India seeks to cast itself as the model of democratic pluralism, as in its bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. On the other, its hunt for fuel is pushing it to reach out to authoritarian governments like those of Sudan and Myanmar, which the United States has sought to isolate. In both of those countries, China's weight is also keenly felt.\nBut India is quickly making inroads. It has persuaded a wary Bangladesh to agree, at least in principle, to a pipeline that would ship gas from Myanmar to India.\nMr. Aiyar, the petroleum minister, has been shuttling to Saudi Arabia, India's largest oil supplier, to persuade it to invest in Indian oil and gas projects, among other things. He has also sought to lure foreign investors to explore for reserves in the Bay of Bengal, off India's eastern coast -- what he buoyantly calls \"the North Sea of South Asia.\"\nBy far, New Delhi's most ambitious proposal is a $4 billion, 1,600-mile pipeline that would ferry natural gas from Iran across Pakistan to India, though a final deal is nowhere near fruition. [Talks resumed on Saturday, when Mr. Aiyar visited Islamabad.] Pakistan stands to collect handsome transit fees from the pipeline. But how it would ensure its security across vast, restive Baluchistan Province, where disgruntled tribal armies routinely attack gas installations, remains a mystery.\nAmong Mr. Aiyar's \"fanciful dreams,\" as he calls them, is yet another pipeline that would dispatch gas from Turkmenistan through Afghanistan, then into Pakistan and India.\n\"We now realize we have to get a large part of our energy from our extended neighborhood, and that means we have to engineer and structure new relationships,\" said R.K. Pachauri, director general of Tata Energy Research Institute in Delhi. The nonprofit institute estimates that India will need to invest $766 billion in the energy sector to meet the growing demand over the next 25 years.\nIndia's changing relationships regarding energy are inspiring a delicate diplomatic dance with the United States. Publicly, Bush administration officials, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on her visit here in March, have frowned on India's plans with Iran. India is pursuing nuclear technology as the United States and European nations are trying to get Iran to give up its own nuclear program.\nThis week, a senior Indian official, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, was in Washington to meet with the secretary of energy, Samuel W. Bodman, to discuss, among other things, nuclear energy options. Whether the United States will turn a blind eye to the Iran pipeline or consider selling nuclear reactors to India remains uncertain.\n\"In some sense there's a delicate tightrope walk that's going on,\" said Ashley J. Tellis of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. \"The Indians are trying to push the limits on what they can get away with, and the U.S. is trying to see how flexible India might be.\"\nMr. Aiyar did not miss an opportunity to remind the United States obliquely that India would not countenance interference in one of its foreign policy priorities -- buying gas from Iran. \"We are sensitive to the concerns and interests of other nations,\" he said, \"even as we expect other nations to be sensitive to our concerns and our requirements.\"\nWhen it comes to molding and marketing India's energy needs, Mr. Aiyar -- a leftist at heart, a diplomat by training and possibly the biggest extrovert in India's Congress Party-led government -- likes to think grandly. He never tires of articulating a chief goal: to persuade China to cooperate rather than compete for oil and gas abroad. Some analysts greet the idea with skepticism.\nSundeep Waslekar, an analyst with Strategic Foresight Group in Mumbai, notes that China can offer a much more comprehensive and lucrative package -- including arms sales -- to energy-supplying countries like Iran, Sudan, or the former Soviet republics of Central Asia. Unless India can offer something strategic to China -- food, for instance -- China would have little reason to join efforts.\nChina-India energy cooperation in the oil and gas sector is \"a beautiful academic idea,\" Mr. Waslekar said. \"I don't see how it could work politically.\"\nMr. Aiyar is unbowed. He offers the idea of an Asian gas grid that would stretch from former Soviet republics like Kazakhstan to the Persian Gulf all the way to China.\nEvery chance he gets, he pushes the analogy of the European coal and gas community, the precursor to the European Union. He demands to know why China and India cannot create the Eastern equivalent. \"An Asian oil and gas community, which could eventually blossom as an Asian identity in the politics of the world,\" he said.\nOf course, for now, a majority of Indians continue to live in the dark -- that is to say, without electricity -- and the most common fuels for Indian households remain among the worst for respiratory health: charcoal and animal dung.\nCorrection: June 7, 2005, Tuesday Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about how India's need for energy is changing its relationships with other countries misidentified a group that was a precursor to the European Union. It is the European Coal and Steel Community, not the European coal and gas community. The article also misstated the rate at which India uses oil. The rate in 2002 was 538 million tons per year, not per day.\nCorrection: June 8, 2005, Wednesday An article on Sunday about India's growing need for energy misstated the country's rate of consumption. It is the equivalent of 538 million tons of oil per year, not per day. A correction in this space yesterday included an erroneous reference to the rate. It represents the use of energy from all sources, including wood and charcoal, not just oil.",

    "text": "Islam Can Vote, if We Let It\n2005-05-21T05:00:00.000Z\nCairo - IN last month's Saudi Arabian municipal elections, the nation's first experiment in real democracy, many were worried because Islamic activists dominated their secular rivals. Indeed, we have seen a similar trend in Turkey, Morocco and Iraq in the last few years; and we can expect it in the coming Lebanese, Palestinian and Egyptian elections. Yet, while this Islamic trend can no longer be ignored, neither should it be a source of panic to Western policy makers and pundits.\nBased on my 30 years of empirical investigation into these parties -- including my observations of fellow inmates during the 14 months I spent in an Egyptian prison -- I can testify to a significant evolution on the part of political Islam. In fact, I believe we may be witnessing the emergence of Muslim parties that are truly democratic, akin to the Christian Democrats in Western Europe after World War II.\nTo understand this evolution, one must look at how the Islamists rose to such prominence. Autocratic regimes in the Middle East have for decades allowed little public space to those who would build civil societies; no freedom of speech, assembly or association. The only space for people to congregate without harassment by the secret police was the mosque. Thus, unwittingly, the autocrats contributed to the growth of the theocrats, who became their mirror images.\nTaking advantage of the rulers' economic and political failures at home and their setbacks on battlefields, the theocrats made compelling cases for their own visions. And through their great efforts in providing services to the poor, they evolved first into de facto social workers and then into local politicians, eventually taking control of cities like Algiers and Oran in Algeria, and Istanbul and Ankara in Turkey.\nSeen as efficient and uncorrupt, these Islamists began to gain in popularity even among secularists and won parliamentary pluralities in Algeria in 1991 and in Turkey 11 years later. (In Algeria the Islamists were not allowed to enjoy the fruits of their victory thanks to a Western-condoned military coup.) Today, some two-thirds of the estimated 1.4 billion Muslims in the world live under democratically elected governments in which Islamists are major players -- with Indonesia, Bangladesh and Morocco joining Turkey as bright spots.\nClearly, on grounds of principle and pragmatism, Westerners should not be dismayed at the thought of allowing religious parties a role in the emerging political structures of the Arab world. For one thing, as citizens, Islamists are entitled to the same basic rights as others. It would therefore be hypocritical to call for democracy in these countries and at the same time to deny any groups wanting to peacefully contend for office.\nSecond, Islamists tend to be fairly well organized and popular. Yes, some have created armed wings to their movements, ostensibly to resist foreign occupation (Hezbollah in Lebanon, Islamic Jihad in Palestine) or in response to authoritarian regimes. But in all cases, a moderate, less-violent Islamist core exists. Excluding the religious parties from the political mainstream risks giving the upper hand to the armed factions at the expense of their more moderate centers.\nRepression has had high costs. Where Islamist groups are denied access to political space, their cause takes on an aura of mythical martyrdom, and their abstract calls for a return to Islamic principles of governance are not put to the test. A phrase like \"the meek are the inheritors of the earth\" resonates with the masses, though it is empty of any practical content. As long as these groups don't have to deal with the complicated business of forging actual political policies, their popularity remains untested. The challenge, therefore, is to find a formula that includes them in the system, but that prevents a \"one man, one vote, one time\" situation.\nOne fairly successful attempt at such a formula was coordinated by King Hussein of Jordan, after widespread riots in 1989 over food shortages in his traditional stronghold in the south. Needing to engage the people more directly in the tough economic decisions that had to be made, he opted for a new constitutional monarchy. He brought all the political forces in the country together in a national congress, in which the rules of the democratic game were enshrined in a national charter. The Islamists signed on.\nSince then, there have been several elections to this body in which Jordan's Islamists have participated, but in only the first did they gain a plurality. Once in power, their sloganeering was put to the test, and voters were not terribly impressed. In the four ministries they held, the Islamists imposed heavy-handed restrictions on female staff members, setting off protests that eventually forced the cabinet members to resign.\nShortly after the Jordanian experiment, King Hassan II of Morocco followed suit with a similar revision of his nation's Constitution, and despite recent terrorist attacks the country seems set on an increasingly democratic path. In 2002, the Turkish Justice and Development Party won the parliamentary elections and formed a government and -- to the surprise of many -- it wasn't the end of the world. In fact, the Islamists emerged as more pragmatic than their secular predecessors in tackling some of Turkey's chronic problems: they softened restrictions on the Kurds, looked to make compromises over Cyprus and began a successful campaign to make Turkey eligible for eventual membership in the European Union.\nAnd consider what has happened in Iraq. Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the most revered Shiite cleric in Iraq, has been the savior of President Bush's policy in Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein. Without his unwavering backing of the January elections, the Arab world would not have seen the stirring images of millions of men and women braving their way out to vote despite threats and suicide bombers.\nOf course, this is not to say that we should expect Hezbollah or Hamas to turn into Western-style democratic parties overnight. While countries opening themselves to democracy should work to bring Islamists into the system, they should not -- and the West should not pressure them to -- allow those groups unwilling to abide by certain rules into the game.\nThese principles would include: strict respect for constitutions and the rule of law, including full independence of the judiciary; recognition of the principle of the rotation of power based on free and fair elections with international observers; pledges that elections be held on a schedule that is not subject to tampering by whatever group comes to power; agreement that non-Muslim minorities must be guaranteed full citizenship and cultural rights, including the right to compete for any elected office, to freely exercise their religion rights and to speak their chosen language; and agreement that women must be assured full and equal participation in public life.\nWhen all parties agree to such conditions, they will have gone a long way toward reducing apprehensions at home and abroad about their participation in politics. This does raise questions about who would guarantee that all parties abide by these rules of the game. Each country, of course, would have to decide for itself; Turkey made its armed forces a guardian of the Constitution, and other places it might be high courts. In any case, there must be faith in the system.\nSo what should be the role of the external actors -- the Western powers, the United Nations, the World Bank and other international organizations -- in promoting democratic reform? Much has been said in the Muslim world about President Bush's \"crusade\" after the 9/11 attacks. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were predicated, among other things, on spreading freedom and democracy in the Middle East. More peaceful approaches toward that end also include the Bush administration's Middle East Partnership Initiative and the Greater Middle East and North Africa Initiative that was endorsed last year at the Group of 8 summit meeting in Sea Island, Ga.\nIn addition, an earlier, overlooked initiative by the Europeans is worth studying, the Barcelona Accord of 1995. Under this agreement, several Arab states, including Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia, pledged to take specific steps for enhancing civil society, human rights and democratic reforms. In return, the Europeans were to offer economic aid, favorable terms of trade and security guarantees. Unfortunately, the governments of the Arab states, with the partial exception of Morocco, enjoyed the benefits of the economic protocols but failed entirely to make the required domestic reforms. PERHAPS the most important role foreign powers can play today is in withholding their aid, trade and technology from despotic regimes. The model is the Helsinki Accord of 1975, which set up a monitoring system of Soviet-bloc states and mandated sanctions for human rights violations, and which ultimately played a major role in bringing down Communist regimes.\nWhether we are in fact seeing an \"Arab spring\" or a mirage depends on where you stand. Many in the Middle East, having been betrayed in the past, cannot be blamed for fearing that this is an illusion, and remembering other spring stirrings of democracy -- like Budapest in 1956, Prague in 1968 and Tiananmen Square in 1989 -- that were brutally crushed while the world looked on.\nFor me, however, something about events of the past few months feels new and irreversible. Too many people in too many places -- Egypt, Iran, Lebanon and elsewhere -- are defying their oppressors and taking risks for freedom. Across the region the shouts of \"Kifiya!\" -- \"Enough!\" -- have become a rallying cry against dictators.\nWith luck, the Middle East may catch the so-called third wave of democracy, which has rolled through some 100 countries since the fall of the dictatorship in Portugal in 1974. But whether it will be a spring wind or a sandstorm will depend in great part on how the Islamists are accommodated in Egypt, Lebanon and Palestine in the months ahead. President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice have hinted recently that the United States would accept the outcome of any fair and free elections, even if it brings Islamists to power. That hint should be explicated in a clear doctrine. A government open to all and serving all is our best weapon against both autocracy and theocracy.\nOp-Ed Contributor Saad Eddin Ibrahim, chairman of the Ibn Khaldun Center for Development Studies and a scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, is a candidate for president of Egypt.",

    "text": "Brooklyn's Technicolor Dream Quilt\n2005-05-29T05:00:00.000Z\nThe new face of New York City is taking shape among the graceful Victorian houses and stout apartment buildings of Ditmas Park, Brooklyn.\nThis softly shaded patch of Flatbush is one of the city's most polyglot and polychrome, what city demographers like to call a melting-pot neighborhood, because no one ethnic or racial group is dominant and many are represented. Moreover, the neighborhood's population of 8,243 is not cut up into distinct ethnic swatches like Williamsburg in Brooklyn -- where Hasidim, Italians, Poles, Latinos and white bohemians live in distinct pockets -- but is significantly intermingled. Residents proudly reel off a multitude of races and nationalities that flank their porches and backyards, and interviews with two dozen residents indicate that the ethnic mix is not merely cosmetic, it is thorough and strong.\nThe outlook for such neighborhoods, according to a new analysis by the Department of City Planning, is bullish. Data from the 2000 census indicates there were 220 melting-pot census tracts among the city's 2,217; in 1970 there were 70. In 2000, they were found in neighborhoods like Elmhurst, Jackson Heights and Flushing in Queens. The ranks are growing as a result of immigration and the apparent comfort level long-rooted New Yorkers feel in cosmopolitan milieus.\n\"People are living side by side in a way that 100 years from now we may take for granted,\" said Joseph J. Salvo, director of the City Planning Department's population division in a speech last month at New York University's Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. New Yorkers, he added, are more ready to say, \"I'm going to live next to the guy even though he's five shades different than me.\"\nIn part, this is the result of a wave of newcomers from two dozen countries since 1965, when a revised immigration law began to shape the city into one in which immigrants or their American-born offspring account for 55 percent of the populace. The decline of crime, the city's liberal tradition, and the sheer habit of encountering different cultures on a daily basis has made New Yorkers more open.\n\"Anybody who rides the subway is going to have a multicultural experience,\" said John H. Mollenkopf of the City University of New York. \"One senses that people who can't handle that sort of thing moved out of New York.\"\nThe analysis by the Planning Department showed that New York stands atop the world in its ethnic variety. Los Angeles has more people born abroad -- 40.9 percent compared with 35.9 for New York -- but most are from Mexico. A handful of world cities rival New York in its proportion of the foreign-born -- Toronto's is 49.4 percent; Sydney, 33.4 percent; London, 27.4 percent -- but the ethnic stew is not as varied, said Mr. Salvo.\nIt is true that for residents who use words like utopia and United Nations in describing Ditmas Park, friendships seldom extend across class lines. \"I notice that the people who live in the apartments and rent and are of a lower income tend to keep to themselves and the homeowners who live in the albeit diverse community of homeowners also tend to be exclusive,\" said Claire Beckman, an actress who has lived in the neighborhood for four years.\nThen too the neighborhood is fairly self-selected, drawing people like Graham and Chelsi Meyerson, restaurant owners, and their 20-month-old daughter, Olivia, who are willing to tackle the discomforts that might arise out of cultural differences.\n\"When Chelsi and I had Olivia,\" Mr. Meyerson said, \"we wanted her to know a lot of different people.\"\nStill the two census tracts that make up Ditmas Park are remarkable for their ethnic palette. The racial breakdown was 40 percent black (almost half from the Caribbean), 23 percent white, 17 percent Hispanic and 16 percent Asian. There are Jews who were born in Russia and others who just moved over from Park Slope, third- and fourth-generation Irish and Italians, and significant smatterings of Bangladeshis, Mexicans, Pakistanis, Chinese, Tibetans and more.\nIn a neighborhood where in 2000 the median household income was $37, 670 -- slightly lower than that of the city as a whole -- there are houses owned by lawyers and executives, yet a fourth of the residents live below the poverty line.\n\"The reason why this works is there's no majority of one -- there's a majority of many,\" said Susan Miller, a mother of four who lives on a block of Victorian houses with people of Indian, Pakistani, Polish, Italian, Jamaican, and Orthodox Jewish backgrounds and a group she describes as \"Caucasian left-wingers.\"\nOthers speculate that Ditmas Park is so varied because it is wedged among more monotone enclaves: Caribbean East Flatbush, the neighborhoods of professionals surrounding Prospect Park, Chinese and Latino Sunset Park, and Orthodox Jewish Midwood and Borough Park.\n\"This area belongs to no one, so you have a lot of everyone,\" said Fred Siegel, an urban affairs professor at Cooper Union and a longtime resident.\nThe ethnic variety is evident on a stroll down Cortelyou Road, the main shopping area, where within seconds a recent visitor passed a black man with cornrows, a Muslim woman with a head scarf, a white mother in Birkenstocks, and a man wearing a skullcap. Vladimir Popov, 67, the clerk at a local video store, can wax effusive on the varying ethnic tastes in film. Cinco de Mayo is a restaurant that has lots of actual Mexican construction workers, not just food enthusiasts. Karali Pitzele, a teacher, is 33 and white. But she considers herself a mix, albeit of religious background: Jewish, Christian and Buddhist. She tells of borrowing spices from her Pakistani neighbor after the neighbor borrowed her table for an evening's dinner.\nMs. Pitzele chose the neighborhood eight years ago in part because her boyfriend then was Jamaican and they felt that as an interracial couple they would not stand out. They didn't. In fact many residents remark on the large number of interracial couples in the neighborhood.\nJoe Wong, a 28-year-old grandson of Chinese immigrants, who is married to Ellen, a white native of Virginia, grew up in Ditmas Park and went to Public School 139, which he described as a \"mini-United Nations.\"\n\"As you're growing up you're getting exposed to the diversity and this becomes second nature,\" he said.\nCross-cultural friendships are run-of-the-mill. One of Ms. Pitzele's closest friends is Dawn Eddy, a 25-year-old teacher born in Trinidad, who herself tells of her Japanese and Italian friends.\nMavis Theodore, a publishing administrator who is also from Trinidad, said she had been friends with Hynda Lessman Schneiweiss, a retired Jewish engineering assistant, for 10 years. They have both lived in the neighborhood for a quarter-century, and they recall when it was largely filled with Jews, Italians and blacks.\n\"This neighborhood is going to demonstrate what Rodney King said, 'Can't we get along?\"' said Mrs. Schneiweiss.\nDaniel Shaw, a senior at Cornell University, went to the neighborhood's schools and nearby Midwood High School and has been friends since kindergarten with Panamanian and Moroccan boys and a Chinese girl. They have all visited him at Cornell. While he told of some unpleasant consequences of the economic diversity in the neighborhood -- he has been robbed at knifepoint and his father was beaten by young men trying to steal his briefcase -- Mr. Shaw said he was glad he had been raised there.\n\"I've been thankful even for the muggings,\" he said. \"It keeps me in check because as much as I grew up in a comfortable house, I know I'm lucky. I can't get too cocky. There are people out there who struggle.\"\nBut some, like Paul Feldman, a Web site editor, contend that the neighborhood is so fragmented that \"its diversity works against a strong sense of community.\"\n\"A mix is happening but there's no personality that is asserting itself,\" he said.\nDitmas Park did not just fall out of an idealist's dreamscape; neighbors work hard at sustaining the mix. Around Christmas, the neighborhood holds progressive dinners, where courses are served at a succession of homes encompassing a range of ethnicities. On Thanksgiving, a black minister holds an open house flapjacks-and-bacon breakfast. Dan Shapiro, a data consultant who has lived in a 15-room Victorian for 25 years, said everyone is invited for funerals and bar mitzvahs and \"everyone shows up.\"\nMs. Beckman, who directs Brave New World Repertory Theater, is putting on a production of \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" on Sept. 18, using her porch and five of her neighbors' porches as the stage. A four-year-old organization, Friends of Cortelyou, sponsors ethnic tastings and pairs recent immigrants with fluent English speakers as \"conversation partners.\"\nAt his year-old restaurant, Picket Fence, Mr. Meyerson intentionally hires a diverse staff, like Justin Alexander, a waiter from Trinidad, and Dana Nagler, a Jewish cook. Vox Pop, a combination coffee house, book store and print shop, holds open-mike evenings, when rap performers, poets and activists of a variety of ethnic backgrounds express their views.\nThere are some who worry that a diverse Ditmas Park may be fleeting. The 1970 census showed a neighborhood that was 95 percent white; Rugby Road was known as Doctors' Row for the professionals who lived in its handsome Victorians.\nDitmas Park started changing dramatically in the late 1960's, said Mr. Shapiro and others, partly because the city, struggling with a mushrooming welfare population, dispatched troubled families to Ditmas Park's empty apartments. Some middle-class whites fled in response, allowing middle-class blacks to buy Victorians at fire-sale prices, effectively integrating the neighborhood.\nThe upsurge of crime throughout the city in the 1970's and 1980's and a shaky economy meant more departures for the suburbs, but groups like the Flatbush Development Corporation managed and repaired hard-pressed buildings and evicted difficult tenants. Stability soon led to an upswing as the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani demanded and got stronger police enforcement, said Mr. Siegel, who was a policy adviser for Mr. Giuliani's 1993 election campaign.\nNow, with prices of some homes surpassing $1 million, people like Ms. Beckman fear that only affluent buyers will consider the neighborhood and that Ditmas Park's multicultural character could dissolve.\n\"What's scary,\" she said, \"is that it could change.\"",

    "text": "Where a Cuddle With Your Baby Requires a Bribe\n2005-08-30T05:00:00.000Z\nBANGALORE, India - Just as the painful ordeal of childbirth finally ended and Nesam Velankanni waited for a nurse to lay her squalling newborn on her chest, the maternity hospital's ritual of extortion began.\nBefore she even glimpsed her baby, she said, a nurse whisked the infant away and an attendant demanded a bribe. If you want to see your child, families are told, the price is $12 for a boy and $7 for a girl, a lot of money for slum dwellers scraping by on a dollar a day. The practice is common here in the city, surveys confirm.\nMrs. Velankanni was penniless, and her mother-in-law had to pawn gold earrings that had been a precious marriage gift so she could give the money to the attendant, or ayah. Mrs. Velankanni, a migrant to Bangalore who had been unprepared for the demand, wept in frustration.\n\"The ayah told my mother-in-law to pay up fast because the night duty doctor was leaving at 8 a.m. and wanted a share,\" she recalled.\nThe grand thefts of rulers may be more infamous, but the bitter experience of petty corruption, less apparent but no less invidious, is an everyday trial for millions of poor people across Asia, Africa and Latin America. Increasingly, it is being recognized as a major obstacle to economic development, robbing the impoverished of already measly incomes and corroding the public services they desperately need.\nThe bribes vary from place to place and in the services affected, but stretch from cradle to grave, according to surveys and anticorruption investigators. People pay to give birth, and to collect their loved ones' bodies from mortuaries, and for everything in between: garbage collection, clean water, medicines, admission to public schools. Even policemen double as shakedown artists.\nSuch petty bribery acts as a hidden regressive tax, according to research financed by the World Bank Institute, the bank's educational and research arm. In Zambia, for example, poor people paid 17 percent of their incomes in bribes for medical care, while the middle class paid only 3 percent. The comparable figures for Paraguay were 7 percent for the poor and only 1 percent for the middle class.\n\"The poor not only are paying much more of their incomes to get the same medical services as the middle and richer classes, but they are also discouraged from seeking basic medical care because they can't afford it,\" said Daniel Kaufmann, director of global programs at the institute.\nWhen low-level officials pick the pockets of the poor, it is also often a reliable indicator of greater corruption higher up the bureaucratic and political hierarchy.\nHere in Bangalore, a city of 6.5 million known for its booming high-technology industry, pleasant climate and good private schools, local health managers commonly pay bribes to senior bureaucrats or elected officials to get good jobs, say investigators, civic leaders and senior civil servants. The health professionals then exact payments from subordinates and patients, emulating their bosses.\n\"Most of the district health officers have to pay bribes to get promotions and postings, and they in turn collect bribes from their staff and patients,\" said Hanumappa Sudarshan, the vigilance director for health and education in Karnataka State's anticorruption agency. \"It's a vicious cycle.\"\nMr. Sudarshan's boss, Nanjegowda Venkatachala, a retired Indian Supreme Court justice who heads the agency, put it even more bluntly: \"The greed of politicians is ruining the country. There's nothing to mince in this regard.\"\nNo matter where the corruption starts, it moves down through the ranks and finally to the poor, for whom it is an inescapable burden.\nThough Bangalore has made progress in fighting corruption, it persists in the hospitals. In the narrow lanes of the slums and working-class neighborhoods around the 30-bed Austin Town maternity hospital, families with babies and toddlers described their personal experiences of bribery.\nShobha Rani, the doctor in charge, emphatically disputed such accounts in an interview earlier this year. \"I've not come across even one patient who's come here and said I've been charged for anything,\" she said. \"So many times, I've spoken to patients without the knowledge of my staff. I say: 'Tell me the truth. What did you face?' They always give me a good report.\"\nBut people who have used the hospital tell a different story. Nagaratna Hanumanthu, 23, and her husband, Hanumanthu, 28, a sugar-cane-juice vendor with a single name, lost their first baby to a raging fever just two days after he was born. Their anxieties were high last November when their daughter was born at Austin Town.\nThe moment the baby emerged, the nurses took her away and demanded $7, the parents said. But Mr. Hanumanthu, a tall, imposing man, said he pretended he knew important people and threatened to complain. The nurses backed down, he said.\nBut then his fears grew that the staff might hurt the baby. \"We had already lost one child, and we were worried we would lose this child, too,\" he said.\nMr. Hanumanthu, who earns about $1 a day, turned to his mother, who makes $11 a month sweeping floors and washing dishes. She gave him money for the bribe.\nAs he described his ordeal, his glowering presence seemed to fill a dark, cramped room of their home in the slums, where his wife rocked the sleeping baby, Sujata, in a cradle.\nIt was far from the first bribe he had paid, he said, and certainly not the last.\nEvery month, he said, he must pay off city workers who threaten to confiscate his pushcart. He has no choice, he said. How else would he make a living? Last summer, he saw what happened to a vendor who refused to move when the city workers told him to. They overturned the man's cart, cracking the motor. He was out of work for three months.\n\"I've studied up to 10th grade and passed,\" he said bitterly. \"I try to earn a decent living, but because of all the demands, I'm tempted to rob and steal to make money fast. I'm fed up with life.\"\nA growing number of surveys of poor households, commissioned by nonprofit groups like the Public Affairs Center here in India, are documenting the problems of corruption and poor public services, arming advocates who are fighting corruption with useful information and providing voters with data that helps them hold elected officials accountable.\nThe center pioneered the use of consumer surveys here in Bangalore to measure the extent and effects of bribery and to give citizens a collective, credible voice about their experience of public services. The approach was the brainstorm of Samuel Paul, who formerly led one of India's premier business schools.\nDuring the past decade, the center has released report cards that that have generated splashy coverage in local newspapers. \"There was power in the information,\" Mr. Paul said.\nThe idea has been widely copied. Today report cards are used in Ethiopia, Uganda and Zanzibar, in Ukraine, Bangladesh, the Philippines and Vietnam.\nBangalore's success in fighting corruption, under the leadership of a reform-minded government that took office in 1999, has enhanced the appeal of report cards. The center's latest survey, done in 2003, found that bribery had fallen sharply since 1999 and satisfaction with public services had risen, though bribes persisted at shockingly high levels in maternity hospitals.\nOne necessary step was removing bureaucratic middlemen. Bangalore substantially reduced corruption in property tax assessments by setting simple rules so citizens could estimate their own property values, cutting out inspectors who had demanded payoffs. Property tax collections rose sharply.\nCleaning up the city's 30 maternity homes, which mainly serve the poor, has proved tougher, however.\nA 1999 survey by the center found that 9 of 10 families whose relatives gave birth in the hospitals reported paying a bribe, usually to see the baby. The average amount paid has since dropped to $7 from about $16. But 8 in 10 women still reported paying bribes in 2003 -- to have their baby delivered, to see the child after birth, to get their newborn immunized or to obtain medicines that were supposed to be free.\nK. Jairaj, who became city commissioner in 1999, said he was appalled when Mr. Paul handed him the original maternity hospital findings six years ago. \"It was the trigger to move the politicians and bureaucrats forward,\" he said.\nAt the center's urging, the city set up boards of volunteers to monitor hospitals. It also posted citizens' charters in maternity hospitals stating that bribery was prohibited and listing phone numbers for complaints. But the boards were often toothless, and many patients already knew bribes were illegal.\nThe city's current commissioner, Karuppiah Jothiramalingam, who took office last year with a new government, said he would retrain hospital workers and punish those who solicited bribes. He added, \"This type of action can only be taken on specific complaints.\"\nBut the ingrained habits of bribery persist in part because the poor, powerless in so many aspects of their lives, are afraid to object. They worry that their newborns will get bad medical care from angry health workers. They dread retribution when they return for subsequent births.\nShireen Taj, a car mechanic's wife, had her first baby at Austin Town on Jan. 21. The family said they paid the going rate -- $12 -- to see the boy.\nRazia Begum, Mrs. Taj's mother, said that even when Shireen was born at Austin Town 18 years ago, the family paid a bribe to see her, though the price then was the same for boys and girls. \"Now boys cost more, girls less,\" she said, describing the devaluing of females in a society where the male child is often more desired. Sometimes the very poorest people are charged less, she and others said.\n\"It's a practice there,\" she said. \"My older daughter also paid. So I brought money.\" The nurses and attendants are the ones who ask for the money, while the doctor is never present, families say.\nAs Razia Begum spoke, an elderly neighbor came to the door. \"If you write about it,\" she said to a reporter, \"they will chase us out of the hospital. Where will we go?\"\nSeveral women who had just given birth and their families, interviewed on an open ward at the hospital and shortly after the mothers were discharged, also said they had been asked to pay bribes.\nMargaret, a 50-year-old grandmother who uses only one name, said she paid to see her 19-year-old daughter's baby the day he was born, Feb. 16. She earns only $10 a month as a maid and said that she was determined to pay no more than $7 -- and that she did not.\n\"Though I felt bad and a little angry, a private hospital would have cost at least 2,500 rupees,\" or about $60, she said. The bribe was still costly but, by the calculus of poverty, a relative bargain.\nThe Hidden Scourge\nArticles in this series examine the impact of corruption on democracy and economic development around the world.

    "text": "Seething Unease Shaped British Bombers' Newfound Zeal\n2005-07-31T05:00:00.000Z\nLEEDS, England, July 30 - Mohammad Sidique Khan was never on the corner, a detail friends offer as a compliment. In a neighborhood where many young South Asian men had lost their way, or foundered into drug dealing, Mr. Khan's peers admired his focus on family, work, working out, and Islam.\nThe discipline of Mr. Khan, 30, was shared, and not just with his friends Shehzad Tanweer, 22, and Hasib Mir Hussain, 18, who joined him on a murderous assignation in London on July 7. The three men and Germaine Lindsay, 19, detonated four bombs that killed 56 people, including themselves.\nMr. Khan, Mr. Tanweer and Mr. Hussain were part of a larger clique of young British-raised South Asian men in Beeston, a neighborhood of Leeds, who turned their backs on what they came to see as a decadent, demoralizing Western culture. Instead, the group embraced an Islam whose practice was often far more fundamentalist than their fathers', and always more political, focused passionately on Muslim suffering at Western hands.\nIn many ways, the transformation has had positive elements: the men live healthier and more constructive lives than many of their peers here, Asian or white, who have fallen prey to drugs, alcohol or petty crime. Why Mr. Khan, Mr. Tanweer and Mr. Hussain in particular crossed a line that no one had before, how they and Mr. Lindsay linked up, or whether their plot was homegrown or steered from outside, remain mysteries, at least to the public.\nBut the question asked since their identities were revealed after the bombings continues to resonate: what motivated men reared thousands of miles from the cradles of the Muslim world, without any direct experience of oppression themselves, to bomb fellow Britons, ushering in a new chapter of terrorism.\nMany here see answers in the sense of injustice at events both at home and abroad that is far more widespread among Muslims than many Westerners recognize; in the rigid and deeply political form of Islam that increasing numbers of educated European Muslims are gravitating to; in the difficulty some children of Muslim immigrants in Europe have had in finding their place or direction.\nIt is a broader narrative being played out by such immigrants across Britain, and Western Europe. The young men here grew up brown-skinned in white Britain, in a blighted pocket of Leeds straddling their parents' traditional values and the working-class culture around them. They have been reared shoulder to shoulder with old stone churches and young hooligans, and face to face with attitudes toward family and morality different from those taught by their parents.\n\"They don't know whether they're Muslim or British or both,\" said Martin McDaid, a former antiterrorist operative who converted to Islam, taking the name Abdullah, and worked in the neighborhood.\nThey are alienated from their parents' rural South Asian culture, which they see as backward. Reared in an often racist milieu, they feel excluded from mainstream British society, which has so far not yielded to hyphenated immigrant identities as America has. They have come of age in an era marked by conflicts between Muslims and better armed powers -- India, Serbia, Russia, Israel, America and Britain -- and the rise of an ideology that sanctifies terrorist attacks against the West in response.\nSo some young men have solved the \"don't know\" riddle by discovering a new assertive and transnational identity as Muslims. The change has played out within families in the small, brick \"back-to-back\" terraced houses of little Beeston's lattice of down-at-the-heels streets.\nIn one corner shop sits Ejaz Hussain, 54, who came from a Pakistani village in his teens, and has reared eight children in Britain. The bombers' fathers and he worshiped at the same mosque; their sons left, rejecting the mosque's form of Islam as incorrect and its determination to keep politics outside the mosque as unjust.\nWalk down Stratford Street, past another mosque of the elders the bombers and their cohort rejected, to the store of Mohammad Jaheer, a burly Bangladesh-born shopkeeper who went \"religious,\" as young men here say, 10 years ago at 16. Islam has saved him from what he calls an animal-like life as a Western businessman spending time at clubs, he said. He helped form the Iqra Learning Center, an Islamic bookshop, five years ago, to educate Muslims and non-Muslims about the faith.\nThat bookshop, just a few blocks from his shop, was raided by the police because of its possible links to the bombers. Over time its education came to include provocative material that some contend was meant to inspire jihad.\nMr. McDaid, who worked at the bookshop, said it was intended only to raise awareness and passions -- among Muslims and the British establishment alike -- about the oppression of Muslims around the world.\nPassions have been raised, among the bombers most radically, but among many others here and across Europe. Mr. Hussain, who helped organize two peace marches in the bombings' wake, rejects the notion that an outsider from Al Qaeda recruited the men, although others disagree.\nHe pointed to his head and said in reference to the bombers, and their peers: \"Al Qaeda is inside.\"\nAn Epic Migration\nEjaz Hussain was 16 when he left his 40-household village in Pakistan and came to Britain in 1967. Everybody was going; no one planned to stay long. He did not realize that he and so many others were part of an epic, and permanent, migration that would reshape Britain in so many ways, the events of July 7 being just one.\nThe British Raj officially ended on Aug. 15, 1947, but its relationship to its subjects did not. In the following decades men of the Indian subcontinent came to Britain en masse to supply cheap, unskilled labor for factories, foundries and, especially, textile mills in northern Britain.\nA majority of the immigrants were Mulsim farmers from the Mirpur region of Pakistani Kashmir. Others came from Gujarat in India, or what is now Bangladesh, or, as with the bombers' families, Punjab Province in Pakistan. Most were poor, with rural backgrounds and often uneducated, although Mr. Hussain, the thoughtful, genteel son of a policeman, had more education than most.\nThey started with perhaps \u00a35 in their pocket, and worked 16 to 18 hours a day, with a beaverlike determination to earn and build something for the next generation.\nMr. Hussain, now 54, worked in factories and mills, drove a taxi, and has run a corner minimart for 15 years.\nIntegration was minimal, thanks to barriers of race and language, culture and religion. The migrants were the colonized who came to live among their former colonizers. \"When we came, we were like servants,\" Mr. Hussain said. Even though they had time for little beyond Friday Prayer, if that, they were Muslims still, for whom true assimilation into Western ways, like drinking, would inevitably be irreligious.\nMany, Mr. Hussain among them, thought they would earn and then go home. Instead, they eventually brought over wives or young families, forming insular communities in which English fluency was dispensable.\nIn the late 1980's, most of the mills and factories closed. Men began driving taxis, or opened shops or other family-run businesses that require round-the-clock tending by an extended family. Others simply retired.\nThe first wave's attitude was, and largely still is, one of gratitude toward Britain, which offered a livelihood and left them alone to practice their religion.\n\"Britain is the greatest country in the world\" for those reasons, boomed Arif Butt, a forceful figure in Beeston who runs one of its mosques and has clashed with its youth.\nArshad Chaudhry, an accountant and member of the Leeds Muslim Forum, sees it differently. \"They were very timid,\" he said of the first wave.\nTough Neighborhoods\nBeeston Hill, where Mohammad Sidique Khan and Shehzad Tanweer were raised, and nearby Holbeck, where Hasib Mir Hussain grew up, have a dreary, dissolute air. The houses somehow seem shrunken in scale, and the dreams of many youth seem to have been sized to match.\nThe two neighborhoods are about 77 percent white and 18 percent \"Asian or Asian British,\" according to the 2001 census. Almost half the population is under 30.\nMany white residents of Beeston tend toward tattoos and pit bulls. The drinking starts early, and openly. Trash and furniture clot some streets. Faces have been ravaged by drugs, whose use peaked a few years ago when legions of zombielike heroin addicts wandered the streets.\nMore than 10 percent of houses are vacant. Nearly a third of the population of about 16,000 receives the British equivalent of welfare. Unemployment is nearly 8 percent, more than double the rate for the rest of Leeds.\nWhites and Asians live for the most part politely, but distantly, adjacent. Both groups say South Asians have actually prospered more than whites, which has generated some resentment. Plenty of British Muslims face staggering poverty and unemployment, but the bombers and their immediate circle were not among them. At least some youth seem more directionless than deprived.\nIn some ways, Mr. Hussain and other elders say, the young people have had it easy. At the age when their fathers worked like mules, the sons are playing cricket, studying, hanging out. Compared with their parents, they are well educated, thoroughly literate, fluent in English and the Internet.\nSome know family businesses are waiting for them to take over. Some go on welfare as soon as they reach adulthood. Some sell drugs. \"They are getting lazy, getting spoiled from the government,\" said Abu Hanifa, 60, another shopkeeper who works around the clock.\nAnd yet Mr. Hussain and others think the young have also had it harder. In an alien culture, work ballasted the migrants, as did the traditional values they had imported from home. The young have no such anchors; they sometimes seem to be living in rooms without walls.\nMohammad Sidique Khan's generation was the first to be educated entirely in Britain. The schools they attended made almost no accommodation to their presence. They learned almost nothing about Pakistan or Islam's history and traditions.\nInstead, they were expected to become British, and many have tried. But in areas like Beeston, they say, that has also meant learning to drink, using or selling drugs and losing one's virginity at an early age.\nThey grew up in rough and often blighted neighborhoods where \"hardness\" -- the ability to fight anyone, at any time -- was essential, said Mr. Hussain's son Nadeem Ejaz, 30, who runs the family's green grocery. The red shoelaces favored by young racists from the National Front remain etched in his teenage memories.\nMany young Muslims, Mr. Khan among them, turned to martial arts or boxing partly to ensure combat readiness.\nBoys regularly divide into white and Asian gangs. In April, a 15-year-old boy was stabbed to death by a member of an Asian mob that pursued him.\nThe children of the immigrants have shed the servility, and passivity, of their parents, Mr. Hussain said. They want their rights, even if they have to fight for them. This inspires both pride and unease in him.\nMr. Hussain sees a continuum of self-destruction between the recent bombings and race riots that occurred just 10 miles away in 2001 -- seemingly disconnected rage. \"Why this damage to their own streets, their own cities, their own communities?\" he asked of the Asian youth who took part in the riots, echoing those who now ask how the bombers could turn on their own society. \"Maybe if we had paid attention then this wouldn't have happened.\"\nA good many young Asian men here are, in British social welfare parlance, NEET: Not in Education, Employment or Training. Here and in other South Asian communities over the past 15 years, they have begun to out-English the English, selling drugs and serving prison terms at alarming rates.\nIn Stratford Street, a Bengali-British drug dealer with a gold tooth and a practiced air of menace sits on a stoop. Mr. Jaheer, the Bengali-British shopkeeper, passes him by. As Mr. Jaheer and his friends see it, the critical battle here has been between those who have succumbed to their milieu, dragging their community down, and those who have sought to rescue and uplift it.\nIn that effort to fight Beeston's addiction, violence and aimlessness, they say Islam has proved an invaluable ally. To those who say Islam turned the bombers against Britain, they answer that Islam also saved youngsters from Britain.\nThe Draw of Religion\nMr. Jaheer was among the first to become religious, and others soon followed. One by one, young men who regularly slept through namaz, or prayers, awakened. Mr. Khan was among them; so, later on, were his fellow bombers, Mr. Tanweer and Mr. Hussain.\nThe group was always a small minority among Beeston's youth, but an influential one. The pioneers coached those who followed them in how to live as Muslims in the West, bringing a new social conservatism to bear. It is permissible to look once at scantily clad women in summer, they would tell youth. After that it is a sin. Young men put away their televisions, saying there was no appropriate programming for Muslims, and sometimes imposed new restrictions on their wives.\n\"They were doing quite well with the young brothers,\" said Nadeem Ejaz, crediting Mr. Khan and others with weaning some youth from drugs. \"It was smack city around here. These people took on the initiative to clean up the community.\"\nThe group of friends created a network of organizations to lure Asian youth off the streets through sports, nature outings and education. For the Leeds City Council, desperate to counter the social ills present in Beeston and similar communities, the men were an ideal conduit. Over the years the council funneled numerous grants to their organizations and says some worked well.\nMr. Khan was among the grantees. Under the auspices of the South Leeds Asian Youth Association, he twice applied for, and won, grants of about \u00a32,000 apiece for gym equipment, according to council records.\nAt the same time, the group's newfound faith was creating distance from its members' peers, and sometimes conflict with parental choices.\nOne of Ejaz Hussain's sons became very religious five years ago. He works at his father's corner shop, joking with customers, calling the women \"luv,\" the standard Yorkshire greeting. But the shop sells cigarettes, bacon and tinned pork, girlie magazines.\nTo him, the shop -- the fruit of his father's life of work -- violates his faith, and he has unsuccessfully tried to persuade the family to give it up.\nReligiously, the young men came at Islam like converts -- questioning everything, accepting nothing. If they were going to practice, they wanted to do it in what they considered the right way. If they wanted to go to heaven, they felt, they had to find the purest form. They wanted evidence for whatever they did in the Koran.\nAll of the young men quickly rejected the Islam of their parents, who practice a Sufi-influenced strain of the subcontinent called Barelvi. Shaped partly by Hindu and folk customs, it believes in the power of pirs, or holy men, and their shrines.\nThe young men, Mr. Khan especially vehement among them, believed such \"innovations\" contaminated Islam.\nThey stopped praying at their parents' mosque, even as they used its basement gym to warn youth against the type of Islam their parents practiced upstairs.\nThey turned, instead, to the more rigid, orthodox Deobandi school of Islam, which also had amosque in town. The adherents of Deobandism include the Taliban of Afghanistan; they take what they see as a literal approach to the faith. In Britain, as in Pakistan, this school is growing fast -- starting seminaries, producing English-speaking preachers and drawing youths away from the more liberal Islam of their parents.\nEventually Mr. Khan and his friends left the Deobandi mosque, too, saying its approach to outreach was too narrow, its focus too apolitical. And the young zealots felt only frustration and contempt for the mosques' imams, who were often brought from the subcontinent, spoke minimal English, knew nothing of the moral maze young British Muslims face, and abided by an injunction by mosque elders that politics or current events involving Muslims should stay outside the mosque.\nA Politicized Islam\nFor the young, Islam was politics. \"There is a lot of hatred\" because of Iraq, Kosovo, Kashmir, Mr. Ejaz said. If the mosque makes subjects like that taboo, if their doors are closed, he said, young people are going to go somewhere else.\nIn Beeston and across Britain, that is exactly what they are doing, which may make Prime Minister Tony Blair's call for mosques to preach against extremism an exercise in futility.\nEducated second-generation Muslims are finding their way to an extreme form of Islam spreading not through mosques but through Islamic bookshops, the Internet and university societies, said Roger Ballard, an anthropologist in Manchester who specializes in Pakistani Muslims in Britain.\nThe form is called Salafism, taking its name from the term for the Prophet Muhammad's companions, although its adherents often reject any label. It originated in 19th-century Saudi Arabia, and has helped inspire groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda.\nThe Salafi demand for purity and rejection of any Islam except that of the early years can lead to deep intolerance even for other Muslims like Shiites. Salafis see politics as embedded in the DNA of Islam. They take to heart the injunction that the ummah -- the global community of Muslims --is \"like one body\": if one part is suffering, the rest will be in pain as well. They believe, therefore, in an obligation to physical jihad, or struggle, under the right conditions.\nFor educated young European Muslims who learned nothing of their own history in school, Salafism is a natural fit, Mr. Ballard said. It provides unequivocal answers. And, he said, it is largely \"do it yourself.\"\nIn Beeston, the young men did do it themselves. After they left the mosques they gravitated to the Iqra Learning Center. There, they were free of their elders and their old ways. They held study circles, debated and produced literature and videos, all with an agenda that was political as much as religious.\nTheir effort to create an Islamic identity in British Muslims has been fueled by the belief that the West is waging a war -- a \"crusade,\" the word President Bush used in 2001 -- against Islam, a notion strengthened by the invasion of Iraq.\nThis notion recurs in the materials circulated by Islamic bookshops and on the Internet. DVD's produced and distributed by Iqra juxtapose images from the Crusades with images of war-mutilated Muslims. A cross drips blood over Afghanistan. In one DVD are images of what Mr. McDaid called \"mujahedeen,\" Muslims fighting in an array of conflicts, but he insisted those images were not on the copies given away.\nUnder new legislation Britain is weighing against \"indirect incitement\" to terrorism, such DVD's could become illegal. That perplexes the young men here. One Briton's propaganda, they point out, is another's truth. Bloodshed in places like Iraq is not their invention, Mr. Jaheer said. \"How can it be incitement if it's facts?\" he asked.\nIn his shop, Mr. Hussain, whose Islam his children rejected as too liberal, opens the newspaper to an article about 25,000 civilian dead in Iraq in the past two years.\n\"People keep asking what was in their heads,\" he said quietly.\nMr. Hussain changed worlds by coming to Britain, and now the world he made here has been irrevocably changed by its youth. The government says community leaders should police their communities, mosques their devotees, fathers their sons. Outside, police close-circuit television vans prowl, there to protect the community from possible retaliatory attacks, but also to watch.",

    "text": "For a Decade, London Thrived as a Busy Crossroads of Terror\n2005-07-10T05:00:00.000Z\nCorrection Appended\nLONDON, July 9 - Long before bombings ripped through London on Thursday, Britain had become a breeding ground for hate, fed by a militant version of Islam.\nFor two years, extremists like Sheik Omar Bakri Mohammed, a 47-year-old Syrian-born cleric, have played to ever-larger crowds, calling for holy war against Britain and exhorting young Muslim men to join the insurgency in Iraq. In a newspaper interview in April 2004, he warned that \"a very well-organized\" London-based group, Al Qaeda Europe, was \"on the verge of launching a big operation\" here.\nIn a sermon attended by more than 500 people in a central London meeting hall last December, Sheik Omar vowed that if Western governments did not change their policies, Muslims would give them \"a 9/11, day after day after day.\"\nIf London became a magnet for fiery preachers, it also became a destination for men willing to carry out their threats. For a decade, the city has been a crossroads for would-be terrorists who used it as a home base, where they could raise money, recruit members and draw inspiration from the militant messages.\nAmong them were terrorists involved in attacks in Madrid, Casablanca, Saudi Arabia, Israel and in the Sept. 11 plot. Zacarias Moussaoui, the only man charged in the United States in the 9/11 attacks, and Richard C. Reid, the convicted shoe-bomber, both prayed at the Finsbury Park mosque in north London. The mosque's former leader, Abu Hamza al-Masri openly preached violence for years before the authorities arrested him in April 2004.\nAlthough Britain has passed a series of antiterrorist and immigration laws and made nearly 800 arrests since Sept. 11, 2001, critics have charged that its deep tradition of civil liberties and protection of political activists have made the country a haven for terrorists. The British government has drawn particular criticism from other countries over its refusal to extradite terrorism suspects.\nFor years, there was a widely held belief that Britain's tolerance helped stave off any Islamic attacks at home. But the anger of London's militant clerics turned on Britain after it offered unwavering support for the American-led invasion of Iraq. On Thursday morning, an attack long foreseen by worried counterterrorism officials became a reality.\n\"The terrorists have come home,\" said a senior intelligence official based in Europe, who works often with British officials. \"It is payback time for a policy that was, in my opinion, an irresponsible policy of the British government to allow these networks to flourish inside Britain.\"\nThose policies have been a matter of intense debate within the government, with the courts, the Blair government and members of Parliament frequently opposing one another.\nFor example, when the Parliament considered a bill in March that would have allowed the government to impose tough controls on terror suspects -- like house arrests, curfews and electronic tagging -- some legislators objected, saying it would erode civil liberties. \"It does not secure the nation,\" William Cash, of the House of Commons, said of the bill. \"It is liable to create further trouble and dissension among those whom we are seeking to control -- the terrorists.\" The measure is still pending.\nInvestigators examining Thursday's attacks, which left at least 49 dead and 700 injured, are pursuing a theory that the bombers were part of a homegrown sleeper cell, which may or may not have had foreign support for the bomb-making phase of the operation.\nIf that theory proves true, it would reflect the transformation of the terror threat around Europe. With much of Al Qaeda's hierarchy either captured or killed, a new, more nimble terrorist force has emerged on the continent, comprising mostly semiautonomous, Qaeda-inspired local groups that are believed to be operating in France, Switzerland, Spain, Italy and other countries.\n\"Terrorists are not strangers, foreigners,\" said Bruno Lemaire, adviser to Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin of France. \"They're insiders, well integrated inside the country.\"\nAnother senior intelligence official based in Europe said the fear was that there would be additional attacks in other European cities by homegrown sleeper cells inspired by Al Qaeda and by the attacks in Casablanca, Madrid and now London.\n\"This is exactly what we are going to witness in Europe: most of the attacks will be carried out by local groups, the people who have been here for a long time, well integrated into the fabric of society,\" the official said.\nWell before Thursday's bombings, British officials predicted a terrorist attack in their country. In a speech in October 2003, Eliza Manningham-Buller, the director general of MI5, Britain's domestic intelligence agency, said she saw \"no prospect of a significant reduction in the threat posed to the U.K. and its interests from Islamist terrorism over the next five years, and I fear for a considerable number of years thereafter.\"\nBritain's challenge to detect militants on its soil is particularly difficult.\nCounterterrorism officials estimate that 10,000 to 15,000 Muslims living in Britain are supporters of Al Qaeda. Among that number, officials believe that as many as 600 men were trained in camps connected with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and elsewhere.\nBritish investigators say that identifying Islamic militants among the two million Muslims living here, about 4 percent of the population, is especially hard. The Muslim community here is the most diverse of any in Europe in terms of ethnic origins, culture, history, language, politics and class. More than 60 percent of the community comes not from North African or Gulf Arab countries, but from countries like Pakistan, India and Bangladesh.\nBefore Sept. 11, 2001, British officials monitored radical Islamists but generally stopped short of arresting or extraditing them. After Sept. 11, the government passed legislation that allowed indefinite detention of terrorism suspects. But last year, it was overturned by Britain's highest court, the Law Lords, as a violation of human rights law.\nComplicating Britain's antiterrorism strategy is its refusal or delays of requests for extradition of suspects by some allies, including the United States, France, Spain and Morocco.\nMoroccan authorities, for example, are seeking the return of Mohammed el-Guerbozi, a battle-hardened veteran of Afghanistan who they say planned the May 2003 attacks in Casablanca, which killed 45 people. He has also been identified as a founder of the Moroccan Combatant Islamic Group, cited by the United Nations as a terrorist network connected to Al Qaeda. An operative in that group, Noureddine Nifa, told investigators that the organization had sleeper cells prepared to mount synchronized bombings in Britain, France, Italy, Belgium and Canada. In an interview last year, Gen. Hamidou Laanigri, Morocco's chief of security, said Osama bin Laden authorized Mr. Guerbozi to open a training camp for Moroccans in Afghanistan in the beginning of 2001. Last December, Mr. Guerbozi was convicted in absentia in Morocco for his involvement in the Casablanca attacks and sentenced to 20 years.\nBut the British government has no extradition treaty with Morocco and has refused to extradite Mr. Guerbozi, a father of six who lives in a rundown apartment in north London. British officials say there is not enough evidence to arrest him, General Laanigri said.\nSimilarly, Baltasar Garz\u00f3n, a Spanish investigating magistrate, has requested extradition of Abu Qatada, a radical Muslim cleric living in Britain who received political refugee status in the early 1990's. A Palestinian with Jordanian nationality, Mr. Qatada is described in court documents as the spiritual leader of Al Qaeda in Europe. Although Mr. Qatada was put under house arrest in 2002 and then arrested, he was freed in March and put into an observation program.\nHe is also wanted in Jordan, where he has been given a 15-year prison sentence in absentia for his connection to bomb attacks during 1998.\nFor 10 years, France has been fighting for the extradition of Rachid Ramda, a 35-year-old Algerian, over his suspected role in a bombing in Paris in 1995 staged by Algeria's militant Armed Islamic Group. Much to the irritation of the French, three years ago, Britain's High Court blocked a Home Office order to hand him over, citing allegations that his co-defendants gave testimony under torture by the French.\nLast week, Mr. Clarke, the home secretary, approved the extradition order, but Mr. Ramda is appealing.\nAnother prime terrorism suspect who operated in London for years is Mustafa Setmarian Nasar, the suspected mastermind of the Madrid bombings. Although the authorities now cannot find him, he is believed to have visited Britain often and lived here openly from 1995 to 1998.\nOfficials believe he tried to organize his own extremist group before Sept. 11, but afterward officials say he pledged loyalty to Osama bin Laden. He lived in north London and was the editor of a militant Islamist magazine, Al Ansar, which is published here, distributed at some mosques in Western Europe and closely monitored by British security officials.\nAcross Britain since Sept. 11, 2001, nearly 800 people have been arrested under the Terrorism Act of 2000, according to recent police records. Of that number, 121 were charged with terrorism related crimes, but only 21 people have been convicted.\nIn one of the biggest antiterrorism cases made here, Scotland Yard arrested 12 men and charged them with making traces of the poison ricin inside an apartment in Wood Green, in north London, in January 2003. But 11 of the 12 men were acquitted without trial based on a lack of evidence.\nSince Thursday's attacks, there have been calls for a crackdown on radical Muslims, including some from Britain's Muslim leaders.\n\"As far as I am concerned these people are not British,\" said Lord Nizar Ahmed, one of the few Muslims in the House of Lords. \"They are foreign ideological preachers of hate who have been threatening our national security and encouraging young people into militancy. They should be put away and sent back to their countries.\"\nHe added, \"They created a whole new breeding ground for recruitment to radicalism.\"\nEven last week's bombings did little to curtail the rhetoric of some of the most radical leaders, who criticized Prime Minister Tony Blair for saying that the bombings appeared to be the work of Islamic terrorists.\n\"This shows me that he is an enemy of Islam,\" Abu Abdullah, a self-appointed preacher and the spokesman for the radical group Supporters of Shariah, said in an interview on Friday, adding, \"Sometimes when you see how people speak, it shows you who your enemies are.\"\nMr. Abdullah declared that those British citizens who re-elected Mr. Blair \"have blood on their hands\" because British soldiers are killing Muslims. He also said that the British government, not Muslims, \"have their hands\" in the bombings, explaining, \"They want to go on with their fight against Islam.\"\nImran Waheed, a spokesman for a radical British-based group, Hizb ut Tahrir, which is allowed to function here but is banned in Germany and much of the Muslim world, said: \"When Westerners get killed, the world cries. But if Muslims get killed in Iraq or Afghanistan, it's the smallest of news. I will condemn what happened in London only after there is the promise from Western leaders to condemn what they have done in Falluja and other parts of Iraq and in Afghanistan.\"\nSo far, there appears to be little effort to restrain outspoken clerics, including prominent extremists like Sheik Omar, who has reportedly been under investigation by Scotland Yard.\nSheik Omar, who remains free, is an example of the double-edged policies in Britain. He is a political refugee who was given asylum 19 years ago and is supported by public assistance. Asked in an interview in May how he felt about being barred from obtaining British citizenship, he replied, \"I don't want to become a citizen of hell.\"\n--------------------\nInformation Sought on British Man By The New York Times\nLONDON, July 8 -- British law enforcement officials investigating the terrorist attacks here asked their counterparts in Germany and Belgium for information about a London man who is accused by the Moroccan government of engineering the May 2003 terrorist attacks in Casablanca, two officials said Saturday.\nThe man, Mohammed el-Guerbozi, 48, a British citizen who was born in Morocco, has lived in London for nearly two decades.\nAt a news conference, Scotland Yard officials denied that Mr. Guerbozi was a suspect in the bombing attacks on Thursday. But on Saturday night, senior British officials said that for caution's sake, they had asked several countries in Europe for information about Mr. Guerbozi and his contacts.\nSeveral news organizations in recent days reported that Mr. Guerbozi had fled London on Thursday. But in a telephone interview Saturday night, he said he was still in London and denied any involvement in the London bombings.\n\"Nothing is true,\" said Mr. Guerbozi. \"What they said about me after the Madrid bombings, they are saying it again and the media are writing the same things. It is not true. Now they say that I fled from London, but this is not true. I'm here.\"\nMr. Guerbozi said he offered to speak with the British police, but they did not accept his offer. \"I'm not in the mountains and I'm not in the forest,\" he said. \"I'm in hiding and the intelligence service and the police know where I am.\"\nBOMBINGS IN LONDON: THE MESSAGE Correction: July 21, 2005, Thursday A front-page article on July 10 about London's attraction as a haven for radical Muslim clerics in the years leading up to the July 7 terrorist bombings misspelled the first name of a prominent Muslim in the House of Lords, who was quoted as advocating the expulsion of these clerics from Britain. He is Lord Nazir Ahmed, not Nizar Ahmed.",

In my 30 years in government, I saw my share of boondoggles, but also many examples of effective action in crisis. One outstanding example was the United States government's response to disastrous floods in Bangladesh in 1991 (when I was deputy assistant secretary of state for South Asia), involving the United States Embassy, the United States Agency for International Development (particularly the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance) and the military.\nThe government officials who are looked on as stars by their colleagues are those willing to bend or break rules during a crisis. Offices that regularly deal with emergencies, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Office of United States Foreign Disaster Assistance, have the authority to bypass normal procedures in abnormal circumstances. Effective officials have good judgment about when to use these powers.\nGovernment can't do everything, but the right officials, with a halfway decent system, can do a lot.\nTeresita C.

    "text": "DGrassi Is tha Best Teen TV N da WRLD!\n2005-03-20T05:00:00.000Z\nAt the studio and back lot of Epitome Pictures, in an industrial part of Toronto, every day was prom night. Tarps covered windows to keep out the sun. Dozens of gangly kids in ill-fitting formal wear swayed to a loop of dance rock in a gym tricked out with blue and yellow balloons. During breaks, 15-year-olds grabbed lunch in the set's shrunken cafeteria. Steps away from a hall lined with scratched-up lockers, a hidden staircase led to the cast's tutoring room, where a few school-age actors logged face time. Some were solving equations, others goofed off, charting city routes on a laptop flight simulator. A boy half sang, half translated the opening number from \"Cabaret.\"\nOutside the tutoring room, Melissa McIntyre, an 18-year-old actress with shimmering rock-chick makeup and dark choppy hair, was destroying her laconic co-star, Shane Kippel, at foosball. After scoring the final goal, McIntyre hooted and just about vaulted onto the game table, a blur of bare arms and boots. For those who know her only from \"Degrassi: The Next Generation,\" Epitome's international cult-hit TV show for teenagers, the victory dance was hard to believe -- like catching James Gandolfini arranging daisies in a glass vase. Ashley, the avenging, depressive good girl McIntyre has played for four years, never celebrates, even on those rare occasions when she wins something. From her first appearance as a sibilant 14-year-old priss, Ashley has followed the quintessential parents'-nightmare story arc: class president to class pariah to lovelorn loner, messing with drugs, disloyal friends and wretched poetry along the way.\n\"I think the biggest thing with Ashley,\" McIntyre said as she collapsed into a beat-up easy chair, \"is she goes through a lot, and she doesn't really always handle it that well.\" She gently wrinkled her face, as if she couldn't believe she plays such a killjoy. \"But you can tell that she learns from it as she goes along.\"\nShe'd better not learn too quickly. This season, after reuniting with her unfaithful bipolar boyfriend and losing her virginity to him on the night of her father's gay wedding, an unusual thing happened to Ashley: she actually matured, became supportive, the typical TV girlfriend. Luckily for McIntyre, by season's end -- August in the United States -- Ashley will return to her self-absorbed, drama-queen roots in a cliffhanger that reduces the person closest to her to a homeless, quivering wreck.\nFilmed in a sitcom-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style, with a cast of actors who really are teenagers, \"Degrassi: The Next Generation\" confronts controversy in a way that American network television wouldn't dream of. A 15-year-old boy uses a penis pump when he discovers he's not as endowed as his rival for his girlfriend's affection. A mousy 13-year-old who wants to be \"hot\" stops wearing underwear to school. A 17-year-old girl wonders whether to abandon her alcoholic mother and move in with her boyfriend.\nThe ensemble -- Ashley and a dozen or so students in overlapping social circles -- have lived through date rape, pedophile cyberstalking, the agony and ecstasy of coming out, drug abuse, discrimination against a plus-size teen model, abusive boyfriends, gay boyfriends who are too out, a school shooting, abortion, ADD, Ritalin abuse, dyscalculia, paraplegia, genetically modified food in the cafeteria, boyfriend poaching, a gonorrhea outbreak, classism, male bulimia and . . . you get the idea. Though the explosive-issue-per-capita ratio is seriously out of whack (and you'd probably not want your kid to attend Degrassi for that reason), the teen-diary attention to B-plot microissues (zits, periods, parents' night) gives the episodes a peculiar authenticity no matter how outrageous their story lines. Without much help from parents and teachers, kid characters try to figure out their lives, and kid viewers around the world second-guess them. That's what the show's creator and executive producer, 57-year-old Linda Schuyler, a former junior-high-school teacher, wants.\nShe and the head writer, Aaron Martin, have often disagreed, she told me nonchalantly, leaning forward in her light-filled office in Epitome's executive wing. Citing responsibility fatigue, Martin had announced that he was leaving the show at the end of the season, but Schuyler, who is maternal in a distant way, wasn't slowing down to mourn. In tight jeans and boots, she sat facing away from her plasma-TV monitor, resisting the temptation to oversee that day's shooting. \"Aaron doesn't have the educational background,\" she continued. \"I maintain that one of the things that makes 'Degrassi' work is that we do quite gracefully blend education and entertainment, but I am completely aware that you have to entertain first. It's not that I want to do a string of P.S.A.'s, but Aaron's background is completely entertainment -- we pull against each other from time to time because he feels that I'm being too intense and messagey, and I feel that he's losing the intent of the show.\"\nSchuyler's insistence on a mix of extreme youthful dysfunction and \"messaging,\" stopping short of public service announcements, is why \"Degrassi\" -- or rather the \"Degrassi\" franchise -- is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year. The current show is the latest iteration in a series that began in 1980 as \"Kids of Degrassi Street,\" a quasi-documentary project that emerged out of theater workshops with local kids. It evolved after a five-year run into the more tightly scripted \"Degrassi Junior High,\" which ran for three years, to be followed by two years of \"Degrassi High.\" That series revolved around a group of kids, tracking them from the beginning of junior high until high-school graduation, using actors whose ages were within one or two years of the characters they played, carrying story lines from season to season without ever entirely resolving them. (The story was finally completed in a TV movie of the week called \"School's Out,\" broadcast in 1991.)\nFrom its heyday in the late 1980's until its current renaissance, the \"Degrassi\" series thrived as a cultish, almost accidental, phenomenon. In the United States, the shows ran on public-TV stations; abroad, they survived an international time and culture lag, selling, sometimes years after they were first broadcast, in 150 foreign markets, including Afghanistan, Algeria, Bangladesh, all of Europe, China, Equatorial Guinea, South and North Korea, Israel, Kuwait, Macao, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Iran and Rwanda. They also ran in Cuba, where a graduate student in cultural anthropology doing field research discovered that the \"Degrassi\" shows were lauded for being educational and endorsing values like \"family and generosity.\"\nAnd so it would probably have continued -- with nostalgic fans annotating devotional Web sites, gathering to screen 20-year-old episodes in hipster enclaves like Austin, Tex., and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and writing theoretical essays, like the ones now collected in an anthology called \"Growing Up Degrassi,\" to be published next fall. But when the first episode of Season 4 of \"Degrassi: The Next Generation\" had its premiere on the N, Viacom's three-year-old digital cable channel, last October, it came in as the highest-rated program of the night among teenagers in all of broadcast and cable television, beating out even supermainstream youth shows like \"Joan of Arcadia\" and \"8 Simple Rules.\" The N claims that the network attracts a higher concentration of 12- to 17-year-old girls than competitors like MTV and ABC Family and of teenagers as a whole than YM and Teen People. This is remarkable because the N is available in only 44 million U.S. homes. And network executives say there's room for another spike in viewers. \"One of the truisms of television is that drama doesn't repeat. . . . 'Degrassi' repeats like nobody's business,\" Sarah Tomassi Lindman, head of programming for the N, told me. Indeed, the N really does repeat the show like nobody's business, sometimes up to 20 hours a week, so much so that some \"Degrassi\" fans refer to the N as \"the Degrassi Network.\"\nThe cast, which attracts a reserved following in Canada, has excited a much more passionate response among a segment of their core demographic in the United States. During the summer of 2004, the N brought cast members to the States for sneak screenings at Madison Square Garden and other urban locations, and then again for mall tours, the kinds of events that record labels use to stoke interest in teen-pop musicians like Avril Lavigne. With only the N's on-air and online promotion -- and some local coverage -- fans swarmed the food courts. In Atlanta, Boston, Los Angeles and Dallas, teenagers lined up for hours to get autographs from cast members. In Honolulu, shrieking kids wearing homemade \"I Love Ashley\" T-shirts gave Melissa McIntyre candy leis they had strung themselves.\nThe paucity of official \"Degrassi\" swag only adds to the show's punkette, do-it-yourself appeal. During an episode in which Ashley and her sometime boyfriend Craig compete against each other in a battle of the bands, the N flashed an on-screen message urging kids to \"Give Craig What He Deserves!\" and download the iron-on T-shirt logo worn by Ashley and her band mates. The image -- Craig's disembodied head engulfed in flames -- was Ashley's Photoshop revenge on him for cheating on her with a 14-year-old classmate, Manny.\nThe Craig-Ashley-Manny love triangle is what drew Kevin Smith -- the 34-year-old writer and director of \"Clerks\" and \"Chasing Amy\" and a longtime fan of the show's earlier incarnations -- to the current \"Degrassi.\" Now Smith is guest-starring as himself and as his cult alter ego, Silent Bob -- half the stoner-comic duo of Smith's hit movie \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\" -- in a three-episode arc. Sitting at a picnic table outside the studio, waiting to shoot his own prom scenes, Smith marveled at the creative freedom Linda Schuyler enjoys. \"How awesome would it be to have your own universe, where you're telling ongoing stories, and everything is within the confines of this piece of property?\" he remarked, smiling almost sweetly. Smith, who himself manages a highly entrepreneurial universe (acting, writing comic books and scripts, running four popular Web sites, selling action figures of himself), explained the long-running appeal of \"Degrassi\" in indie-music terms. \"The garage-band ideal is where I present something to you and say, 'You've got to check this out,' \" he said. \" 'Degrassi' still has that. You can still tell more people than not about the show, and they're like, 'I've never heard about it.' Fans aren't threatened by its popularity.\"\nFrom the start, \"Degrassi\" hewed to a singular formula: telling kid stories from a kid's point of view. But that didn't stop the writers from projecting their own messages onto teen-vetted behavior. Shelley Scarrow, a 34-year-old writer of some of the show's most controversial episodes, sticks up for the sexually active girls with a big-sister fondness. \"Emma is one of the 'Everygirl' characters,\" she said, \"so when Emma's making out . . . you can pretend you're making out.\" She thinks of Ashley as her superego, and Ashley's romantic nemesis, Manny, as her id, but her face positively lights up when she talks about a minor character, \"supertrashy\" Amy, who recurs on the show only when there's a need to show extremes of drunkenness and promiscuity that the leading ladies of \"Degrassi\" won't stoop to. \"I heart Amy,\" Scarrow gushed.\nScarrow's and Canada's old-fashioned liberal openness hasn't always played well abroad: stations often choose to alter specific episodes and some have simply stopped broadcasting the show altogether. In 1988, PBS edited an abortion episode so U.S. viewers wouldn't see a teenage girl push her way through a crowd of anti-abortion protesters (shoving plastic fetuses at her) on her way to a clinic. The BBC stopped showing \"Degrassi Junior High\" following episodes that dealt with teenage pregnancy and lesbian daydreams. Deals are still pending with several Latin American countries. It's not hard to imagine the discussion in standards offices around the world about whether to show episodes like \"Secret,\" in which teenage girls (including, of course, Amy) \"earn\" brightly colored bracelets for \"hooking up\" with random guys from school, or \"Moonlight Desires,\" in which the gay class president shares a kiss with his straight male friend.\nStill, the storytelling risks that \"Degrassi\" favors -- even when watered down for non-Canadians -- have more edge than those on competing shows because these kids look like real kids, with pimples, sweaty hair and tragic wardrobes. And that's because they are real kids. \"You take a 23-year-old,\" says Schuyler, \"and even if they look 100 percent believable as a 15- or 16-year-old, the performer, no matter how good an actor they are, brings with them five or six more years of life experience. 'Degrassi' is a show about firsts, so when you're doing a show about firsts, and some of your actors are really experiencing these things for the first time, there is a sincerity and an authenticity that comes through in the performance that I don't think the best actor in the world can necessarily create.\"\nDuring story meetings at the start of production each spring, the writers appraise the returning young actors, looking for changes in demeanor and appearance, keys to new story lines. They'll consult the big board on which timely social issues, written on note cards, shape the season, and right away they'll start the matching process, assigning \"issues\" -- like date rape, abortion and bullying -- to the right kid. There are always surprises. Between the first and second seasons, Shane Kippel, the 18-year-old actor who plays the cocky-yet-regretful budding villain, Spinner, lost a lot of weight, frosted his hair and suddenly found himself fast-tracked into an A plot, dating the school's queen bee, Paige. Miriam McDonald, 16, who stars as the do-gooder, Emma, went from geek to beach-blond model between Seasons 3 and 4, so the writers pinpointed the character's steely vanity and turned one of the show's gawkiest kids into a social piranha.\nSchuyler has always aimed for naturalistic performances from her young actors, an aesthetic she traces to her roots as a junior-high-school teacher in the 70's. She borrowed the school's 16-millimeter camera and Nagra recorder for a documentary about first-generation immigrant kids and their experiences with racism in Canada. Realizing she'd rather be making films about young people than teaching media studies to them, she quit her job and began producing documentaries geared to a junior-high audience. Working with local school kids, Schuyler and her partner at the time, Kit Hood, created the \"Degrassi\" franchise from a patchwork of public and private money. Canadian public television and the Boston PBS affiliate, WGBH, helped finance the series.\nTrue to its documentary roots, the last in the series, \"Degrassi High,\" ended when the kids graduated from high school, and Schuyler moved on to other television projects. In 2000, Schuyler was meeting with the programming director of CTV, Canada's leading commercial broadcaster, when she began to reminisce about \"Degrassi.\" The CTV executive, Susanne Boyce, told her, \"Linda, I don't think you're done with it.\" The premise of the new show was irresistible: in \"Degrassi Junior High,\" circa 1987, the character Spike becomes pregnant and keeps her baby. In 2001, that baby would be approaching junior-high age. Soon Schuyler and a new partner began raising money for \"The Next Generation.\" It hit the air (in Canada) that year, with a new cast of students and a handful of popular holdovers from \"Degrassi High.\"\nThe holdovers, who call themselves Degrassi Classic, now star as parents, mentors and teachers of the new cast. With the recycling of characters and actors, plots can now span decades, drawing adult fans who remember the show's earlier incarnations. But the Classic cast often presents a challenge for the creators of the current \"Degrassi.\" \"It's a struggle,\" Shelley Scarrow said. Audiences expect old cast members to be good. \"People get mad when we make Classic cast into jerks.\"\nStacie Mistysyn is familiar with the problem. She has been a \"Degrassi\" star longer than anyone -- since she was 10 years old. Every few weeks during production season, Mistysyn, who is 33, returns to the scene of her childhood TV stardom and shoots a few peripheral scenes. In Los Angeles, where she has lived for almost 10 years, Mistysyn, with her close-cropped blond hair, is one of the slim and lovely aspiring-actress masses. You can easily picture her holding her own against Kiefer Sutherland on \"24,\" authoritatively spouting off geopolitical jargon. But in Toronto she is Caitlin. Caitlin used to be at the heart of the show. (In a typically \"Degrassi\" plot twist, when Caitlin spurned one very creepy \"artsy\" boyfriend, he killed himself.) Now she's a crusading journalist, a surrogate stepmom to the hard-luck orphan, Craig, and dating her old Degrassi High boyfriend, Joey.\n\"We needed someone to come in and shake things up,\" Mistysyn said, as she waited to be called to the set where she'd be shooting scenes with Kevin Smith. Smith says he fell in love with Caitlin 15 years ago, when he was just a real-life convenience-store clerk. The three-episode arc -- in which Smith directs a \"Jay and Silent Bob\" movie, using \"Degrassi\" as a production set -- won't be shown in the United States until this summer, but it has already brought an abundance of grown-up press to the show in Canada. For his part, Smith is happily plugging \"Degrassi\" in sold-out speaking engagements and on his wildly popular View Askew Web site. Teen life -- it's so contradictory!\" exclaimed Matthew Duntemann, the executive design director of the N, as he gestured around his office, which is decked out with time-warp youth-culture detritus: a \"Tommy Talker\" ventriloquist's dummy, an old-school Tonka dump truck, comic books both classic (\"The Sea Wolf\") and contemporary (\"Eightball\"). The N headquarters, in Midtown Manhattan, is full of dressed-down publicists and programming executives ducking past posters of SpongeBob SquarePants. Duntemann, with his cowlicked hair, looks like a grown-up version of one of the \"alpha teens\" on the N -- hip cartoon characters who star in teasers that hype \"Degrassi\" and other series. The alpha teens were created for the N by Berkeley-based comic-book author Adrian Tomine, whose \"Optic Nerve\" series focuses on beguiling young melancholics. \"You're not afraid of them, but they're cool,\" Duntemann told me, in what might as well be the channel's operating philosophy.\nThe N is eager to avoid looking too forbiddingly \"New York.\" The goal is a warm, comforting \"destination\" with universal appeal. When the network first gathered focus groups to comment on \"Degrassi,\" the kids almost always guessed that it was filmed in California, despite the cast's accents and frequent mentions of Toronto. To give the channel a fresh, un-Manhattan look, its designers scouted teenagers' dressers and bedroom walls, finding inspiration in regional T-shirt logos and posters. They filmed empty schools and suburban houses in Florida, Pennsylvania and New Jersey and populated them with the Tomine cartoon kids who comment, sometimes in oblique near haiku, about the evening's programming, creating a sort of \"Degrassi\" halo effect. \"I like him,\" a cartoon girl says. \"Like a crush?\" her friend asks. \"As much as I like 'Degrassi'!\" the first responds, almost sincerely. Even if you're watching a rerun of old teenage shows like \"My So-Called Life\" or \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\" during the commercial break you're constantly reminded that a \"Degrassi\" episode is right around the corner. The latest \"Degrassi\" miniseason was moved up a week to provide the strongest possible lead-in to the network's highly promoted new show \"Miracle's Boys,\" a v\u00e9rit\u00e9 miniseries set in Harlem, with episodes directed by big names like Spike Lee and LeVar Burton.\nThe N is a marketer's dream come true, a TV channel that doesn't care how many 25-year-olds watch its shows. If the network has given \"Degrassi\" the highest profile the show has enjoyed in its 25-year existence, the show has repaid the favor by lending its cult legacy to a fledgling niche station. Of all the programming the N originally scheduled when it went on the air in 2002, \"Degrassi\" is the only show still playing.\nBut disaffected \"Degrassi\" fans find fault with a lot of things. They point to the network's habit of scheduling the show in four and five episode \"miniseasons,\" followed by months of reruns, and to the network's tendency to censor violent or potentially upsetting scenes, like the one of Craig, later found to be bipolar, facing down an oncoming train, or the scene in which Ashley has an Ecstasy-induced meltdown (at age 14). But most often, they point to \"Accidents Will Happen,\" a recent two-part episode that never played in the States because the 14-year-old Manny chose to terminate her pregnancy, yet she was spared both medical complications and lasting regret. Even in the wake of a large burst of media attention, including a discussion in The New York Times about the episode's realism and balance, and frank disappointment from the show's creative team in Toronto, the N refused to broadcast \"Accidents.\" Savvy American kids were forced to download the show from one of various unofficial \"Degrassi\" Web sites if they wanted to see it.\nThat's where the Donoman comes in.\n\"You're being banned again,\" Adam (the Donoman) Donovan, a 19-year-old moderator on Yahoo's largest \"Degrassi\" message board, e-mailed a scary fan recently. \"Congrats new record.\"\nDonovan, a sophomore at the University of New Hampshire, started watching the show when he was 16 and has stayed true. Together with his friend Jeremy Litwicki (who goes by the name Cerebral Assassin), he runs the site \"the Hangout,\" which just celebrated its first-year anniversary and has more than 8,000 members.\nWhen he's not expelling stalker members who get too attached to the actors, he's promoting peer-to-peer file-sharing of shows, as well as personal remixes of favorite \"Degrassi\" story lines edited to songs by, say, Usher and Green Day. In short, a kid will reduce three years' worth of narrative to its lurid, moody essence and attach a song of the moment as the soundtrack.\nOne production that circulated last November starred wry 16-year-old Ellie (played by stylish Stacey Farber, 17, who was a front-row presence during Fashion Week this February). The clips showed Ellie cutting her forearms with Exacto blades, rescuing her drunken mother from their burning home and hugging her fatigues-clad father before he headed off to Afghanistan, edited to \"My Vietnam,\" a dirgelike ballad by the pop-punk singer Pink. Ellie, who suffers from a cutting compulsion, wears her red hair in braids and favors knee-high boots, gauntlets and spikes. She is a favorite of young female fans; in 2004, there was a miniepidemic of 10- to 13-year-old Quebec girls who cut their forearms in imitation of her, and during one of Farber's mall appearances, kids told her that they were dressing up as Ellie for Halloween. (At the official \"Degrassi\" Web site, kids register in faux homerooms, decorate their online lockers and speculate with grave sincerity on which character they'd be most likely to befriend if they actually attended Degrassi.)\nThe strength of \"Degrassi\" is that \"it feels realer than most reality shows,\" said Tom Ascheim, the 42-year-old president of Nickelodeon Digital Television and general manager of the N, as we sat in his Manhattan office. \"It feels minute-to-minute real. It feels real to our audience and real to our families.\" Still, Ascheim, who has a 12-year-old son, admits that kids are a tough audience to capture. \"You have a window. You might lose some kids at 14, 15, others at 17. You make a place for them, and for all the marketing genius you throw at a demographic, you realize you're lucky if the kids stay.\"\nOnstage, ashley and craig lip-synched a song that Ashley (or rather, Melissa McIntyre) wrote with the \"Degrassi\" creative team. It was an infuriatingly catchy pop-rock dance song, and some of the extras couldn't stop dancing even after shooting stopped. The lyrics, though, were typical Ashley: \"Through the mud and the dirt/All the tears and the hurt/It seared and it burned and I died.\"\nCraig kept looking over at Ashley, smiling, singing harmony, but for much of the song Ashley didn't meet his eyes. Every now and then, through her bangs, she'd look out at the audience. They were all dancing in time to her misery, her message. They had lived through Degrassi with her. There was her ex-boyfriend, in a wheelchair after being shot. Her little stepbrother, whose best friend was the school shooter. Manny, whom Craig got pregnant. They were all there. They'd stayed. They'd survived.\nBen Neihart is the author of the novels \"Hey, Joe\" and \"Burning Girl,\" and \"Rough Amusements: The True Story of A'Lelia Walker.\"",

    "text": "All-Embracing Man of Action for a New Era of Papacy\n2005-04-03T05:00:00.000Z\nOn the night of Oct. 16, 1978, a vast, impatient throng in floodlit St. Peter's Square cheered wildly as white smoke curled from a chimney atop the Sistine Chapel, signaling the election of a new pope. A long wait had ended, but the enthusiasm was somewhat premature.\nCardinal Pericle Felici emerged minutes later to introduce Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Poland, the first non-Italian pope since 1523. But even he had trouble pronouncing the name -- voy-TEE-wah. Hardly anyone, it seemed, knew who he was. Murmurs and questions rippled through the predominantly Roman crowd.\nThen a powerfully built man with slightly stooped shoulders and a small smile on his angular face stepped onto the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica. Cheers faded into silence. The crowd waited.\nHe stood at the balcony rail, looking out, a Polish stranger in the fresh white robes of the pope. And there were tears in his eyes as he began to speak.\n\"I have come,\" he said in lightly accented Italian, \"from a faraway country -- far away, but always so close in the communion of faith.\"\nThere were scattered cheers, and they grew louder as he went on.\n\"I do not know whether I can express myself in your -- in our -- Italian language,\" he said, pausing.\nThe crowd roared appreciatively, and the laughter swelled into resounding cheers.\n\"If I make mistakes,\" he added, beaming suddenly, \"you will correct me.\"\nTumult erupted.\nThe cheers went on and on, and then grew into rhythmic waves that broke on the basilica facade and echoed across the square in a thundering crescendo:\n\"Viva il Papa!\n\"Viva il Papa!\n\"Viva il Papa!\"\nA Pope of a Different Sort\nIt was an extraordinary beginning. But almost from the start, it was evident to many of the world's Roman Catholics, and to multitudes of non-Catholics as well, that this was to be an extraordinary papacy, one that would captivate much of humanity by sheer force of personality and reshape the church with a heroic vision of a combative, disciplined Catholicism.\nIt was to be the longest and most luminous pontificate of the 20th century, the second longest in the history of the church, a 26-year era that would witness sweeping political changes around the world, the growth of the Roman Catholic Church to more than a billion baptized members from 750 million, and the beginning of Christianity's Third Millennium.\nThe man who would call himself John Paul II was not the traditional papal figure, compassionate and loving but ascetic and remote behind the high walls and the elaborate ceremony of the Vatican. Here was a different kind of pope: complex, schooled in confrontation, theologically intransigent but deftly politic, full of wit and daring, energy and physically expressive love.\nMore than outgoing, he was all-embracing -- a bear-hugging, larger-than-life man of action who had climbed mountains, performed in plays, written books and seen war, and he was determined from the start to make the world his parish and go out and minister to its troubles and see to its spiritual needs.\nCompared with other popes, he did not create many new programs and he sought to clarify and enforce Catholic ideas rather than to reshape or expand them. He was, if anything, more traditional than his namesake predecessors, John XXIII, Paul VI and John Paul I.\nBut he saw himself primarily as a spiritual figure who transcended geographical and ideological boundaries, and he saw it as his mission to deliver a clear set of Catholic ideas and to foster peace and human dignity through the power of faith and the practical efforts of well-meaning nations.\nAt the dawn of the millennium and in the twilight of his papacy, he also saw it as his duty to issue a daring, unprecedented apology for the errors of his church and individual Catholics over the last 2,000 years, a catalog of sins that included episodes of religious and cultural intolerance and of historic injustices against Jews, women, indigenous peoples, immigrants and the poor.\nWhile he did not cite specific misdeeds, his apology set out a framework that theologians said appeared to encompass the Crusades, the Inquisition, the burning of heretics and forced conversions of American Indians, Africans and others. The church's response to the Holocaust was not specified, but the apology was dedicated to a \"confession of sins against the people of Israel.\"\nAnd there were other acknowledgements -- notably one in 1998 for the failure of many Catholics to help Jews in the Holocaust, and another in 2002 to the victims of sexual abuse by priests in a scandal that engulfed the church in America with cases of pedophilia and accusations of cover-ups by bishops and other members of the church hierarchy.\nThe traumatic scandal, in which scores of priests were accused of molesting children, some repeatedly over many years, led to criminal charges, the removal of many priests and avalanches of lawsuits and multimillion-dollar settlements. It also challenged the moral authority of the church in America and threatened to taint the final years of a papacy whose signet had been human dignity.\nJohn Paul's extraordinary effort to cleanse his church's conscience, along with his global travels, his challenges to human rights violations around the world, his attacks on the economic injustices of capitalism and his steadfast resistance to changes in church teachings on birth control, priestly celibacy, the ordination of women and other issues were among the fundamental traits of his pontificate.\nBut they were not the only legacies by which history would judge John Paul. Along with the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the pope played a major role in the collapse of Soviet and European Communism, instilling the adversaries of Communist governments in Poland and other parts of Eastern Europe with confidence that their cause would outlast the repression of their rulers.\nHis very election boosted the spirit of believers in Eastern Europe, for whom the appeal \"Be not afraid!\" -- repeated three times during the sermon he preached at his installation on Oct. 22, 1978 -- had a special meaning.\nIn June 1979, millions turned out for the pope's first visit to his native Poland, masses of people acting independently of the Communist government and gaining a liberating sense of their own autonomy. In retrospect, the visit was widely seen as a detonator of the Solidarity labor movement's challenge to Poland's Communist government in 1980 and ultimately of the changes that swept the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe a decade later.\nTraveling widely -- through Europe, Africa, the Americas and Asia -- the pope electrified vast crowds with a populist blend of showmanship, evangelism and impassioned appeals for human rights, peace, disarmament and justice for the poor and the oppressed.\nOn that first papal visit to Poland, he scolded the officially atheistic Communist government for treating people \"merely as a means of production.\"\nHe went to Brazil and chastised the military junta in power. \"Violence,\" he said, \"kills what it intends to create.\"\nHe went to Ireland and confronted zealots of the Irish Republican Army and their Protestant foes: \"On my knees I beg you to turn away from the path of violence and to return to the ways of peace.\"\nHe went to Japan and mourned: \"To remember Hiroshima is to abhor nuclear war. To remember Hiroshima is to commit oneself to peace.\"\nHe went to Auschwitz and asked, \"How far can cruelty go?\"\nAnd he went to the United Nations in New York and spoke to world leaders of peace for \"all the men and women living on this planet.\"\nAn Intensely Physical Presence\nPeople everywhere found the pope's presence intensely physical. Not content to wave from a passing limousine, this man with the ruddy face and glowing eyes would jump out and plunge into the crowds, hugging, kissing, grasping and talking to people; singing, smiling, winking and reaching out with his quarry-worker hands to touch and bless them.\nChiefs of protocol winced. Security men were horrified, fearing the kind of attack in which he was shot in St. Peter's Square in 1981. Aides of all kinds grew exhausted trying to keep up with him. But he was determined to take his message from St. Peter's around the globe.\nOver the quarter century of his papacy, the pope traveled to 129 countries on 104 trips abroad. He visited and revisited Poland and made many trips through other European lands. Again and again he journeyed to Asia, South America, Central America and Africa. He made five papal visits to the mainland United States: triumphant multicity tours in 1979 and 1987, a meeting with President Bill Clinton in Denver in 1993, a tour in October 1995 that took him to New York, New Jersey and Baltimore, and a final visit, in 1999, to St. Louis.\nHe did not go to China or Russia, though he expressed a wish to visit both, and he met President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia at the Vatican in February 1998, shortly after journeying to Cuba. In 1993, he went to the former Soviet Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and visited Albania, Europe's poorest land, where he urged the newly non-Communist nation to nurture its long-suppressed religious freedom. He also visited several former Soviet republics -- Kazakhstan and Armenia after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on America, and Azerbaijan in 2002.\nChina's Communist leaders, seeing religion as a means of political dissent, never agreed to legalize Roman Catholicism, and let Catholics worship only in an official Patriotic Church. The Vatican made overtures to Beijing in the 1990's, but did not thaw a relationship frozen over many issues, including the Vatican's recognition of Taiwan, which China considers a renegade province.\nThroughout his papacy, John Paul expressed a hope of journeying to the Holy Land, to visit the sites where Jesus lived and died and to lend his moral authority to the quest for peace in one of the world's most troubled regions. The political and logistical problems seemed insuperable until the millennium.\nThen in March 2000, he made one of his most dramatic trips, a six-day valedictory journey to Jordan, Israel and Palestinian-held territories that saw the 79-year-old pope, frail with infirmities, step nimbly through the political and religious minefields of the Middle East, a capstone of his papal travels.\nRespectful dissent was voiced by some who greeted the pope on his trips. Occasionally there were demonstrations, even some protests that turned violent. But many Vatican officials and Catholic leaders who at first had been skeptical of his travels came to see them as valuable and successful.\nOthers believed the trips were not the best way to reach people in a world saturated with electronic stimuli and entertainment extravaganzas. Spectacular trips, some theologians argued, left no lasting results; they chided the pope, calling his travels the religious equivalent of rock concerts that failed to offer something transcendent.\nAnd while many Catholic leaders said the trips had lifted the church spiritually and financially, there were complaints about the costs. The 1987 trip to the United States, for example, cost $20 million -- all but $2 million of it raised by nine dioceses he visited -- and some critics said the money could be better used to aid the homeless or hard-pressed parochial schools.\nYet as the journeys mounted, it became clear to many Catholic thinkers that the travels were not mere visits to a sprawling flock, but had become a central feature of his papacy: the forceful, global reassertion of Roman Catholic orthodoxy through a new sacramental exercise using jet planes, television and a remarkable stage presence.\nIn the last year, the pope was forced to curtail his travels as the burdens of age and illness -- the trembling hands and slurred speech, the inability to walk or hold his head up, and other manifest frailties of Parkinson's disease -- grew increasingly heavy. He took two relatively short trips abroad last year, to Switzerland in June and to the shrine of Lourdes in France in August.\nHe continued to meet world leaders and to address major issues. He received Vice President Dick Cheney in January 2004 and met President Bush in June, using the occasions to reiterate his unhappiness over the American-led invasion of Iraq and the continuing fighting there, and he appealed for a speedy restoration of sovereignty to the Iraqi people.\nThe pope was also touched last year by a controversy over whether he had endorsed Mel Gibson's film \"The Passion of the Christ.\" The movie's promoters claimed that the pope, after a preview, had said, \"It is as it was.\" But his secretary denied there had been any appraisal. It seemed likely that the pope had been drawn into the unwitting service of a film many Jewish and Christian leaders feared could rekindle claims that Jews were collectively responsible for the Crucifixion.\nBesides the pope's limited time away from the Vatican, there were increasing signs recently that his papacy was drawing to a close. He was hospitalized for nine days in early February for treatment of breathing difficulties and influenza, and for the first time as pope he was unable to preside over Ash Wednesday services marking the start of Lent. He was hospitalized again after suffering a respiratory relapse, and underwent a tracheotomy to allow him to breathe.\nThere were voices of concern that the pope's illness might create a vacuum of leadership for the church, and talk of a possible resignation. While four popes had resigned, the last was St. Celestine V, who abdicated five months after his election in 1294 at the age of 79. Vatican officials said John Paul was unlikely to step down, especially because one of his strongest messages -- respect for human dignity at all stages of life, from the womb to the frailties of old age -- had at last come full circle to encompass him.\nIn addition to his global travels, the pope asserted his mission in traditional ways as well, by appointments of like-minded cardinals and bishops around the world -- in September 2003 he elevated 31 new cardinals, bringing to about 120 the number at that time who would be eligible to vote in the election of the next pope -- and by papal teachings that upheld the church's condemnation of birth control, its exclusion of women from the priesthood, its requirement of celibacy for priests in the Latin rite and its suspicion of revolutionary social movements.\nA Pope's Instructions\nOver the span of his papacy -- and serving in many ways to define it -- John Paul issued 14 encyclicals, or papal instructions, dealing with a wide range of topics: social and economic issues, war, the meaning of morality, doctrinal questions, faith and reason and other matters.\nIn 1979, his first encyclical, the 24,000-word \"Redemptor Hominis,\" or \"Redeemer of Man,\" expressed the core of his conviction: that caring for human life springs from the love of Christ. It also warned that mankind was living in an era of growing fear and weapons of war that raised the specter of \"unimaginable self-destruction.\"\nOther encyclicals included three statements on economic justice. In 1981, \"Laborem Exercens\" (\"On Human Work\") emphasized the social character of labor and the active role of the laborer in completing the task of divine creation; it opposed government control over economies, but seemed to favor collective ownership and management by workers, a kind of democratic socialism.\n\"Sollicitudo Rei Socialis\" (\"On Social Concerns\"), in 1988, drew an unsparing picture of desperation in poor nations and pockets of deprivation in affluent societies. It blamed the East-West conflict for distorting economic development, criticizing \"liberal capitalism\" and \"Marxist collectivism.\" And it introduced a \"right of economic initiative.\" The church had upheld private property rights in the 19th century, then had gradually acknowledged society's right to regulate property. But the pope's phrase appeared to signal a new respect for innovative, entrepreneurial forces.\n\"Centesimus Annus\" (\"The Hundredth Year\"), issued in 1991 to mark the centenary of the first major papal statement on social and economic conflicts, analyzed Communism's fall and the economic issues it posed for Eastern Europe. It recognized superior dynamism in market economies over statist ones, but said Communism's failure should not blind capitalist societies to \"quasi-servitude\" in poor nations or the \"idolatry of the market\" in rich ones.\nA 1993 encyclical, \"Veritatis Splendor\" (\"The Splendor of Truth\"), was a statement of moral theory intended to encourage reflection and discussion. It did not list rights and wrongs, but discussed conscience, reason and freedom, and argued that morality rested on basic truths about human nature and the world, not on individual choice or social consensus.\nIn 1995, \"Evangelium Vitae\" (\"Gospel of Life\") denounced abortion and euthanasia as \"crimes which no human law can claim to legitimize.\" The pope also urged Catholics to oppose secular laws that violate what he called the fundamental right to life, and he reaffirmed the church's condemnation of contraception, experiments with human embryos and the death penalty.\nJohn Paul's 13th encyclical, \"Fides et Ratio\" (\"Faith and Reason\"), perhaps his most personal, marked his 20th anniversary as pope in 1998. Crystallizing a lifetime of philosophical and theological thought, it amplified upon the historic church position that faith and reason are both requisite in the search for truth, and it rejected various modern philosophical trends, including post-Enlightenment rationalism, Marxism and nihilism.\nHis 14th and last encyclical, in 2003, was a stern reminder that divorced Catholics who remarry cannot receive communion.\nThe pope's conservative views were not hard to trace. Coming as he had from a country where the church was under siege by a totalitarian government, he had found it necessary to reassert tenets of his faith and aggressively confront secular creeds competing with the church for the loyalties of the people.\nTo many Catholic leaders, particularly in the Vatican, the church at large was under similar siege when he became pope. The reforms of the Second Vatican Council in the early 1960's, which revolutionized the church by taking a more accepting attitude toward modernization after centuries of isolation from, and even hostility to, contemporary thought, had not halted the tide of secularization in the church's traditional heartland, Western Europe.\nIndeed, the cultural tumult of the 60's had only reinforced the appeal of revolutionary Marxism, the sexual revolution and other challenges to Catholic tradition. Many theologians, who viewed Pope Paul VI's tenure as a period of drift and uncertainty, regarded the moral authority of the church, and of the papacy, as being in decline.\nJohn Paul agreed that much of the church was in disarray, its long stability shaken by secularization and permissiveness. In principle, he supported the reforms of Vatican II, and often emphasized the \"collegial\" principle under which the church is governed jointly by the pope and its bishops. But he was convinced that his personal authority was the key, that through his own highly visible, international leadership, he could clarify the principles and invoke the discipline he regarded as necessary to unify and reinvigorate the church.\nBut he did not rely on personal charisma alone to carry out what some called his \"restoration.\" In 1983, he approved a revised Code of Canon Law to replace the code promulgated in 1917 and rendered out of date by many of Vatican II's reforms. In 1992, he also approved a new \"universal catechism\" to guide church leaders around the world in presentations of Catholic beliefs. Both documents set firm limits on what were seen as ambiguities and invitations to further change in the documents of Vatican II.\nTo remove what he called lingering doubts, in May 1994 he reaffirmed church doctrine that women could not be ordained as priests and said the matter was not even open to debate. The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which oversees church teaching, went further in 1995 by declaring that the doctrine of ordaining only men as priests was \"infallibly\" taught -- a designation reserved for teaching on faith and morals that is considered irreversible, free from error and requiring full assent from the faithful.\nThe pope carried these church views onto the world's stage. In 1994, as 180 countries planned a United Nations conference in Cairo on the potentially catastrophic population explosion projected for the 21st century, he orchestrated a campaign against draft proposals favoring abortion rights, contraception and other measures endorsed by feminists and population experts.\nThe campaign -- the Vatican's most concerted in years on international policy and the pope's most heartfelt since his crusade against Communism -- put a heavy strain on his relationship with President Clinton, who favored safe legalized abortion and efforts to stabilize a global population that experts said could grow to 8.5 billion from 5.7 billion in 35 years.\nThe Cairo conference adopted a strong declaration endorsing family planning and giving women more control over their lives to help stabilize populations. But the Vatican shaped the language so that it did not enshrine any universal right to abortion and excluded abortion as a means of family planning.\nIn 1995, the pope appeared to be at pains to stress his support for women's rights. He credited the women's movement with positive achievements and offered an apology for injustices against women in the name of the church. But Vatican comments on the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing, signaled no major changes in church teaching that portrayed women as mothers, educators and mainstays of the family.\nIn a key appointment, John Paul placed Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger at the head of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. A theologian who had campaigned for the openness introduced by Vatican II, Cardinal Ratzinger shared the fear that the church was fragmenting and the belief that the innovations of Vatican II had to be channeled and disciplined.\nWith Cardinal Ratzinger giving a new luster and militancy to papal authority and to the conservative theology that had long prevailed in Vatican offices, John Paul's administration took a form that some regarded as a throwback to the monarchical papacies of the 19th century.\nDissident Catholic theologians were dismissed or excommunicated. Liberal cardinals and bishops were replaced. And in 1998, the pope changed canon law to put many passionately discussed issues, including euthanasia and the ordination of women, beyond the realm of debate for the faithful. He also made it almost impossible for groups like the National Conference of Catholic Bishops of the United States to make statements of doctrine or public policy that diverged from the Vatican. In the same vein, in 2003, under the pope's orders, the Vatican admonished all Roman Catholic lawmakers to oppose legalization of same-sex marriage and adoptions by gays and lesbians. In January this year, the pope unequivocally condemned gay marriage.\nOver the years, there were protests, petitions and other acts of dissent, especially in America and Europe, in response to the hard-line stances of the pope. In some countries, church attendance declined, and there were defections by priests. Predominantly Catholic Ireland voted to remove its constitutional ban on divorce, and 1.5 million Catholics in Germany signed petitions calling for the ordination of women. Italy, 84 percent Catholic, was a living protest in the 1990's: it had Europe's lowest birthrate, a sign of popular disdain for prohibitions on artificial birth control.\nCrisis and Change\nNo one doubted the power of John Paul's voice or the depth of the feelings he evoked. But his personal popularity aside, many Catholics -- especially in America and Western Europe -- were distressed by his unswerving opposition to change, even in the face of crisis. The depth of distress was never more profound than in the priest-pedophile scandals in America, which broke in 2002 after decades of predatory abuse and suffering hidden by out-of-court settlements with victims and a revolving door of treatment and new assignments for offending priests.\nThe scandals exploded in January after disclosures that Cardinal Bernard F. Law of Boston had for years sent the Rev. John J. Geoghan Jr. from parish to parish, despite accusations of serial pedophilia. He was eventually accused of molesting 130 children and sentenced in one case to 9 to 10 years in prison. In August 2003, the defrocked Mr. Geoghan was strangled by an inmate at a Massachusetts prison.\nCardinal Law, under pressure, gave prosecutors the names of 80 priests accused of sexual abuse over the decades, although the Massachusetts attorney general eventually reported that at least 789 children and probably more than 1,000 had been sexually abused by 250 priests and other church workers in the Boston Archdiocese since 1940.\nWithin weeks of the disclosures, bishops across the country began a purge, removing scores of accused priests and turning names, dates and details over to prosecutors. Emboldened, hundreds of victims made accusations, many of them decades old and unprosecutable under statutes of limitations. But some criminal cases were prosecuted and hundreds of civil suits were filed. Facing enormous settlements and financial crises, some dioceses had to sell property.\nPolls showed growing disaffection among Catholics, and for months the pope and the Vatican remained aloof. But in April 2002, after the American bishops asked for guidance, the pope summoned America's cardinals to Rome for a conference on the scandals. It produced no sweeping changes.\nThe pope acknowledged the suffering and offered an expression of concern that was taken by many to be an apology. Calling the abuse criminal and \"an appalling sin in the eyes of God,\" he said, \"To the victims and their families wherever they may be, I express my profound sense of solidarity and concern.\"\nBut he sent conflicting signals on a proposed zero-tolerance policy, saying there was no place in the priesthood for those who abused minors, but then suggesting that some offenders might warrant a second chance.\n\"We cannot forget the power of Christian conversion, that radical decision to turn away from sin and back to God, which reaches to the depths of a person's soul and can work extraordinary change,\" he said.\nAmerican cardinals proposed removing some priests who abused minors, but drew a distinction between serial predators and those who were \"not notorious.\" The ambiguity was unresolved, even after American bishops, meeting in Dallas in June, voted overwhelmingly for a policy that called for the removal of any priest who had ever sexually abused a minor, and for increased cooperation with law-enforcement and a national lay board to monitor progress.\nInstead of approving the policies, however, the Vatican voiced reservations, saying the bishops had gone too far in eschewing a statute of limitations, in broadly defining child sexual abuse and in requiring that all sex abuse claims be reported to the police. The Vatican said some of the remedies might violate canon laws that protect the rights of priests, and it recommended further \"reflection\" by a commission partly controlled by Vatican emissaries.\nCardinal Law, after nearly a year of protests and abuse lawsuits with $100 million in claims that threatened his archdiocese with bankruptcy, resigned as archbishop of Boston in December 2002. He was succeeded in July 2003 by Bishop Sean P. O'Malley, a Franciscan friar who swiftly met with some abuse victims and began trying to heal the wounds with financial settlements and a new tone of open dialogue. Last year, the pope chose Cardinal Law to head St. Mary Major Basilica in Rome.\nAside from the sex scandals, many American Catholics said the church and the pope were out of touch. Women, blacks, Hispanics, homosexuals, and even some priests and nuns urged him to be more sensitive to their needs. He usually voiced sympathy, but urged the supplicants to remain faithful to church teachings, which were not altered.\nThe result was a restoration of strong centralized authority in the pope. While that strength endeared him and the church to many, it repelled others who believed that the future of Roman Catholicism lay in greater diversity and flexibility, dispersal of power and adaptability in a swiftly changing world.\nJews and Palestinians\nThe pope's relations with Jews were both troubled and pathbreaking. More than any modern pope, John Paul moved boldly to end the estrangement between Catholics and Jews. He was the first pope to pray in a synagogue, the first to acknowledge the failure of individual Catholics to act against the Holocaust, the first to call anti-Semitism a sin \"against God and man,\" and the first to make an official papal visit to the Holy Land.\nJews were often dismayed with his decisions and pronouncements. But he established diplomatic relations between the Vatican and Israel and set the course of Catholic-Jewish relations on a high plane of engagement and warmth, in contrast to the distance and frigidity of earlier eras.\nHis 1982 meeting at the Vatican with Yasir Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, was met with blistering criticism from the government of Israel and from Jews around the world. The pope said afterward that he only wanted to foster peace in the Middle East. And he would not be deterred: he met Mr. Arafat eight more times.\nThe Vatican supported peace accords between Israel and the Palestinians, but debate over the status of Jerusalem was a continuous sore point: Israel saw the city as its \"united and eternal\" capital, while the Vatican pressed for its recognition as a city holy to Christians, Muslims and Jews alike.\nLong troubled by the failure of Pope Pius XII to condemn publicly the killing of millions of Jews by the Nazis in World War II, leaders of Jewish groups were outraged at John Paul's Vatican meeting in 1987 with President Kurt Waldheim of Austria, who had served in a German Army unit implicated in the deportation of Jews in Greece.\nThe pope wrote an apostolic letter in 1989 evoking Christian sorrow over the Holocaust, and in 1998 -- a decade after promising to do so -- issued a historic document, \"We Remember: A Reflection on the Shoah,\" which apologized for the failure of many Catholics to protect Jews in the Holocaust.\nWhile the Vatican viewed the document as groundbreaking, many Jewish groups rejected it because it praised Pius XII's \"quiet diplomacy\" and did not cite his failure to speak out against the Holocaust. The church held that Pius had personally helped to save thousands of Jews, but did not publicly criticize the Nazis for fear that even more Jews as well as Catholics might be killed.\nEven after John Paul delivered the most sweeping apology ever made by a pope -- a public act of repentance for the errors and misdeeds of Catholics over the last 2,000 years that was woven into the liturgy of a Sunday Mass at St. Peter's Basilica on March 12, 2000 -- Jewish critics were quick to note that he had not specifically mentioned the church's behavior during the Holocaust.\nLeading Jews constantly scrutinized papal statements and often decried phrases in which they detected rebukes of Jews for rejecting Christianity or suggestions that Judaism's validity was exhausted with the coming of Jesus.\nPapal aides said the criticisms had stung the pope, who spoke often of a common Christian-Jewish biblical heritage and made other overtures to Jews. In 1985, he met Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel at the Vatican, and in 1986 made the first recorded visit by a pope to a synagogue, entering Rome's Central Synagogue and, to ringing applause, hailing Jews as \"our elder brothers.\"\nThe wounds were reopened from time to time. Jews were outraged when nuns set up a Carmelite convent at Auschwitz in 1984. Polish Catholic leaders said it would be relocated by 1989. But the deadline passed, Jewish protesters entered the grounds, and Cardinal Josef Glemp of Warsaw denounced them in a way that sounded anti-Semitic. The convent was finally closed in 1993 by a papal order.\nIn 1990, Jewish and Catholic leaders met in Prague and pledged to combat outbreaks of anti-Semitism in post-Communist Eastern Europe. The pope endorsed a call for Christian \"repentance\" for anti-Semitism made by Archbishop Edward I. Cassidy, head of the Vatican office for relations with Jews, and John Paul's standing with many Jews had been restored by 1992, when a group was formed to study diplomatic relations.\nTies With Israel\nAfter 17 months of talks, the Vatican and Israel formally recognized one another with diplomatic accords in December 1993, and six months later, in June 1994, the Holy See and Jerusalem established full diplomatic relations with an exchange of ambassadors. It was a political and religious milestone.\nBut within months, the relationship was troubled anew. In August 1994, John Paul conferred a papal knighthood on Mr. Waldheim, citing his peace efforts as United Nations secretary general from 1972 to 1980. Israeli and other Jewish leaders were outraged that the pope had honored a man who had served with Nazi units that massacred civilians, executed prisoners and deported Jews in the Balkans. Mr. Waldheim disavowed any war crimes, but the Justice Department called his denials unconvincing and after 1987 barred him from the United States.\nAnother painful issue for Jews -- a cross erected at Auschwitz to commemorate the pope's 1979 visit -- arose on a trip to his homeland in 1999, when Poland's chief rabbi, Pinchas Menachem Joskowicz, approached him on a receiving line and introduced himself as a survivor of the death camp. \"I have a favor to ask Mr. Pope,\" the rabbi said. \"I ask Mr. Pope to give a call to his people to also take this cross away from the camp.\"\nIf the pope was offended, he gave no sign, listening patiently and replying quietly. But a papal spokesman later called the cross a \"local issue\" and not a Vatican concern.\nJewish criticism of the pope was vociferous again when he beatified -- and in 1998 canonized -- a German convert from Judaism, Edith Stein, who became a Carmelite nun and was gassed by the Nazis at Auschwitz in 1942. While she was declared a saint as a Christian martyr, many Jews, including her relatives, insisted that she had been killed because of her Jewish background.\nThe pope acknowledged as much, but failed to mollify critics, who were also incensed by his beatification of Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, the archbishop of Zagreb during World War II, when a Nazi puppet regime ruled Croatia and 700,000 Serbs, Jews and others were sent to death camps.\nWhen John Paul finally made a six-day journey to the Holy Land in March 2000, it was widely seen as a personal triumph and high point of his reign -- a poignant blend of sacred and secular gestures delicately balanced in a land revered by all the Abrahamic faiths: Judaism, Islam and Christianity.\nThere had never been an official papal visit to the Holy Land, though Paul VI had made an informal trip there in 1964, staying only 12 hours and pointedly never referring to Israel. (John Paul, as Karol Wojtyla, the archbishop of Krakow, had visited Jerusalem in 1963.)\nJohn Paul made his long-awaited pilgrimage amid heavy security, traveling first to Mount Nebo in Jordan, where the Bible says Moses first looked out over the Promised Land, and on to Amman and the Jordan River site where Jesus is said to have been baptized.\nIn Tel Aviv, President Ezer Weizman and Prime Minister Ehud Barak received the pope as one of the most important visitors in Israel's history, and his presence in Jerusalem later was hailed by Israeli leaders as nothing less than a Christian affirmation of the Jewish right to a homeland.\nFor Palestinian leaders, his presence was also a symbolic triumph. He went to Mr. Arafat's home in Bethlehem and to a squalid Palestinian refugee camp. Mr. Arafat called his visit a ringing endorsement of Palestinian nationalist aspirations and a recognition of Palestinian suffering under Israeli rule.\nIn gestures to Israel's tiny Christian populations that were also moving personal experiences, the pope visited sites venerated as those of Jesus' birth, Last Supper, Crucifixion, burial and Resurrection. He also met the Greek Orthodox patriarch and leaders of the Maronite Christians, Armenian Catholics, Melchites and Chaldeans.\nIn Jerusalem, he saw the Ashkenazic and Sephardic chief rabbis, and went to Al Aksa Mosque to meet Sheik Ikrima Sabri, the city's chief Islamic cleric. He went to the Western Wall, Judaism's most sacred site, and, following the custom of Jewish visitors, placed a note in a crevice, a plea for reconciliation that was the theme of his pilgrimage. At Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial, he paid homage to the six million victims of Nazi persecution.\nPolitics and Religion\nCloser to home, the pope often found himself at odds with Italians. Many were harshly critical of him for leading a campaign in 1981 to repeal Italy's liberal abortion law. The voters upheld abortion rights, and many resented what they called his interference.\nIn 1985, the Italian government and the Vatican signed an historic concordat disestablishing Roman Catholicism as the state religion; the pope said it showed church respect for Italy's independence, although he reserved the right to speak out on national issues. In 2002, John Paul became the first pope to visit the Italian Parliament, and used the occasion to call for the enactment of policies to encourage and support larger Italian families.\nHe was also criticized inside and outside the church for his opposition to \"liberation theology,\" a school of thought originating in Latin America but influential elsewhere too. Blending biblical themes with Marxist and sometimes Leninist economic analyses, it was an underlying justification for the Catholic clergy's involvement in political struggles for justice for the poor in Latin America and other parts of the third world.\nFor years, John Paul tried to draw a delicate boundary between religious and political involvement, saying that concern for social justice was the rightful function of the Catholic clergy but that outright political action violated the calling of nuns and priests. Class struggle, he said, could not be the church's solution to social injustice.\nIn Latin America particularly, the clergy's resistance to the noninvolvement doctrine was strong. The Rev. Leonardo Boff of Brazil, a movement leader, was silenced by Rome for a year; in 1992 he resigned from the priesthood to protest Vatican restrictions on writings by the clergy and members of religious orders.\nAnother champion of liberation theology, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the first democratically elected president of Haiti, denounced the Vatican in 1992 for recognizing military leaders who had deposed him in 1991. Since 1982, when he became a priest, Father Aristide had excoriated the Haitian church for what he called its complicity with brutal dictatorships. He left the priesthood after being returned to power by United States forces in 1994, and was overthrown last year amid violent protests and charges of corruption.\nEven some members of the Curia, the Vatican's central administration, were disenchanted with the pope. Speaking behind cloaks of anonymity, some contended that he was a poor administrator, neglected necessary paperwork, spent too much time traveling and was too much the showman. Some Vatican prelates said that in private he was somber, serious, enigmatic, sometimes quixotic, a man who hid his feelings and did not say much.\nCritics said he devoted too much attention to Poland and Eastern Europe and not enough to Western Europe early in his papacy. But his refusal to accept the Iron Curtain contributed forcefully to Communism's fall, and in later years he generally supported European political and cultural unification. He also made religious reconciliation a major concern.\nThere were grand ecumenical gestures. Besides his visit to the synagogue in Rome, he embraced the archbishop of Canterbury at Canterbury Cathedral in England in 1982 and prayed with another archbishop of Canterbury at the Vatican in 1996. In 2003, he met another Anglican archbishop, Rowan Williams, at the Vatican, and warned him against the ordination of gay priests, a matter that had deeply divided Anglicans. The Church of Rome and the Church of England studied ways to end a 450-year rift, but nothing came of it.\nThe pope also made overtures to Eastern Orthodoxy. In May 1999, he visited Bucharest, Romania, and prayed with Patriarch Teoctist; it was the first papal trip to a predominantly Orthodox country in nearly a thousand years. The schism that had kept Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christians apart since 1054 was not ended, but the visit was an ecumenical waymark.\nSix months later, the pope visited Georgia, in the Caucasus, another mainly Orthodox country. He was greeted warmly by President Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister who also helped prod Communism's fall, but his reception by Georgian Orthodox Church leaders was guarded.\nOn the same trip, his last of the millennium, the pope went to India, where Christians, a tiny fraction of the population, had been the target of beatings, killings and other persecution. He met Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and other religious leaders, but won no support for his plea for toleration of his church's hope to evangelize Asia.\nHe undertook other interfaith dialogues. In 1983, he joined a Lutheran service and praised Martin Luther on the 500th birthday of the Reformation's leader. But no major agreements or ecclesiastical changes emerged from those contacts, and most theologians said John Paul, for all his good will toward other faiths, had not substantially advanced the ecumenical cause.\nAn Astonishing Succession\nHe was a poet, a playwright, the author of many books and hundreds of articles, a philosopher, a formidable debater, an actor, an athlete with a passion for skiing, swimming and mountain climbing, a professor of social ethics and a linguist fluent in seven languages and skilled in a dozen. But at the time of his election as 264th bishop of Rome, the pope was almost unknown outside the church hierarchy and his native Poland, where he had been a priest since 1946, the archbishop of Krakow since 1964 and a cardinal since 1967.\nThere had never been a Slavic pope. The last pontificate of a non-Italian -- that of Adrian VI, a Dutchman from Utrecht -- had ended 455 years earlier, in the era of Luther's rebellion in Germany. There had been 45 Italians on the throne of St. Peter since then.\nAfter the death of Pope Paul VI on Aug. 6, 1978, a majority of the College of Cardinals -- the body that elects the pope -- agreed that his successor should be an Italian but not connected with the Curia. On Aug. 26, the college elected Cardinal Albino Luciani, patriarch of Venice, who assumed the name John Paul I, combining those of his immediate predecessors, John XXIII and Paul VI, an expression of continuity he intended to preserve.\nBut John Paul I died a month later, on Sept. 28, and the cardinals returned for a new conclave starting Oct. 14. Predictions were that the successor would again be an Italian. But a rift developed among Italian cardinals, the largest national group in the college, and forced a compromise.\nConservatives had rallied to Cardinal Giuseppe Siri, archbishop of Genoa, a champion of orthodoxy and a candidate in every conclave since the death of Pius XII in 1958. Most moderates wanted Cardinal Giovanni Benelli, archbishop of Florence and an aide to Paul VI. In early balloting, neither came close to the required two-thirds plus one -- 75 of 111 participants -- and a search for a compromise candidate ensued.\nThe name of Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Poland was raised by Cardinal John Krol, the Polish-American archbishop of Philadelphia, and by Cardinal Franz K\u00f6nig, archbishop of Vienna, and prelates from West Germany.\nCardinal Wojtyla was an attractive candidate, theologically orthodox yet a man of personal dynamism and proven political skills who could reach out to Eastern Europe and the peoples of Communist nations and the third world, one who could be a spokesman for peace, disarmament and justice in the world.\nHe had been a tough opponent of the Nazis, the Marxists and the Stalinists in Poland and was emerging as a bold voice within the church. He was also physically vigorous and only 58, 10 years younger than most popes elected in this century, and he could be expected to have a long pontificate.\nHis election, on the eighth ballot, met with almost universal astonishment outside the Sistine Chapel. But among Poland's 31 million Catholics, 92 percent of the population, and among millions of Americans of Polish descent, it was an occasion for pride and celebration that went on for days.\nThe new pope quickly set to work to put his stamp on the papacy. There were clues to its character in his earliest pronouncements. Addressing crowds on the night of his election, he twice invoked the name of the Virgin Mary and vowed total trust in her, a signal of doctrinal conservatism that would be a hallmark of his reign.\nHis greeting, \"Praised be Jesus Christ\" -- an ancient earthy phrase used by Polish peasants and others in deeply Catholic rural areas of Europe, but one having an archaic ring in cosmopolitan Rome -- was a sign that whatever lofty locutions were to come, his papacy would be rooted in his own humble origins.\nAccordingly, he put decorum aside and stripped daily life in the Vatican of many of its ceremonial frills. He eschewed the papal pronoun \"we\" in favor of \"I\" and did away with the pomp of a traditional triple-crown investiture, substituting an outdoor inaugural Mass in St. Peter's Square that was attended by 100,000 people and seen on television around the world.\nIgnoring the usual papal preoccupation with the Curia's bureaucracy, he made it known that not all Vatican administrators would keep their jobs. In an early move to pre-empt opposition, he received the intransigent traditionalist French prelate, Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, who had been suspended two years earlier. The archbishop was excommunicated before he died.\nThe pope also received Andrei A. Gromyko, the Soviet foreign minister, and asserted that dialogue with the Communist nations was the \"only way to ease\" mutual problems. And he met the leaders of various world Jewish organizations and called for \"a fraternal dialogue and fruitful cooperation.\"\nOutdoorsman and Athlete\nThe new pope had been an athlete and outdoorsman all his life, a soccer player, backpacker, camper, boater and long-distance runner, and he looked it. He was solidly built and vigorous, with a bullish neck and strong, stooped shoulders that hinted of his youth as a laborer and factory worker. He moved with a deliberate, confident step, a graceful man for his size.\nHe was 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighed 175 pounds. His graying, once blondish hair was close-cropped, and his eyes were dark and deeply expressive, sometimes wide with mirth, sometimes narrowed to slits of concentration. His hands were fascinating: big, creased, workman's hands that swept the air in gestures of mildness or came together, poised to pray.\nHe did not smoke, but he liked a glass of wine with meals. He wrote many of his own speeches and other pronouncements longhand. While for some it shattered an old-fashioned papal image, he liked to chat, to joke and to laugh heartily. He loved to swim and refused to give it up, so he had a pool built at the summer palace at Castel Gandolfo. Word that the pope was taking daily dips caused no little stir and delighted cartoonists, who pictured him in the water with a miter on his head. When a high-ranking prelate suggested that the pool must have been expensive, the pope quipped, \"Holding another conclave to elect a new pope would cost even more.\"\nHe had traveled widely as a cardinal, visiting the United States in 1969 and 1976, Australia and Polynesia in 1973 and most of the countries of Europe on regular pilgrimages from Poland to Rome, and he resolved early to continue his sojourns as pope. His command of languages -- including Polish, Latin, Italian, French, German, Spanish and English -- was an enormous advantage, allowing him to speak directly to people nearly everywhere, from podiums and in the streets. In January 1979, his first trip outside Italy as pope was to the Dominican Republic and Mexico, where millions heard him voice concern for the oppressed. He also rejected notions of Christ as a political or revolutionary figure, called the church's mission religious and not social or political, and added, \"The church wishes to stay free with regard to the competing systems.\"\nA Fateful Visit\nHis first journey to Poland, in June 1979, proved to be one of his most important trips. There was no way to know at the time, but the visit was, many historians say, the beginning of the end for Communism in the Soviet sphere -- proof for all that the raw power of government could not overcome the power of faith.\nIt began just after the 900th anniversary of the martyrdom of St. Stanislaus, Poland's patron saint, and it exposed weaknesses in the Polish Communist government, which had long sought to extinguish fires of Catholicism.\nThe government first rejected a visit. Then, trying to limit the impact, it restricted his itinerary, muted advance publicity and refused to let workers take time off. But all that made no difference. From the moment he arrived and knelt to kiss the Polish earth until his tearful departure nine days later, his homecoming was a succession of thundering triumphs.\nFrom Warsaw to Auschwitz to Krakow, in 36 public appearances, he clasped old friends in headlocks, sang hymns and folk songs with his people, offered Masses for throngs that stretched across hillsides, and without directly attacking the government repeatedly challenged its authority. \"Christ cannot be kept out of the history of man in any part of the globe,\" he told vast crowds in Warsaw. \"The exclusion of Christ from the history of man is an act against man.\"\nCoal miners, housewives, university students, young people in blue jeans -- 13 million people of every age and description -- turned out to see him. They strewed his way with flowers, they sobbed joyously, and they broke into chants like football fans: \"We want God! We want God! We want God!\"\nIn Gniezno after an open-air Mass for 100,000 young people, the pope joined in singing popular songs. In Czestochowa, 500,000 pilgrims fell to their knees when he reconsecrated the nation to Mary, \"queen of Poland.\" At Auschwitz, where a million people, mostly Jews, had been killed by the Nazis, he spoke of this place \"built on hatred and contempt for man in the name of an insane ideology.\" Referring to a dedication in Hebrew for victims, he declared: \"It is not permissible for anyone to pass by this inscription with indifference.\"\nMonths later, the pope's role as a moral leader was reinforced by a journey to Ireland and the United States. He was eager to confront sectarian strife in Ulster, the erosion of the Irish church to secularization, and in the United States a church caught in turbulent debate over birth control, abortion, the role of women in the ministry and other issues.\nHis outdoor Mass in Dublin drew 1.2 million people. In Drogheda, near the border of Northern Ireland, he begged Catholics, Protestants and especially the militant Irish Republican Army to \"turn away from the path of violence.\"\nIn the United States, with 50 million Roman Catholics, he was a dramatic new figure in a world that seemed to lack outstanding leaders. Visiting six cities and rural Iowa in seven days, he captured national attention continuously, his every word and gesture televised and chronicled in the press. Vast crowds lined his routes, attended his masses, heard his homilies and joined the spectacles. At each stop -- in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Des Moines, Chicago and Washington -- virtual holidays were declared, and public officials outdid each other with receptions of staggering magnitude.\nFor two whirlwind days, he dominated life in New York City. He addressed the United Nations, visited St. Patrick's Cathedral, offered Mass at Yankee Stadium and engaged in a playful dialogue with young people rallying at Madison Square Garden. He visited a church in Harlem, rode in a rain-soaked ticker-tape parade on lower Broadway and addressed crowds at Battery Park and Shea Stadium.\nHe often waded into enormous, friendly crowds, hugging and kissing people, saluting neighborhoods and church groups. At the Battery in a pouring rain, he said: \"I address a special word to the leaders of the Jewish community, whose presence here honors me greatly. Shalom! Peace be with you.\"\nThere were protests. In Washington, Sister Theresa Kane, president of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, surprised the pope in introducing him to an audience of nuns by saying, \"The church must regard the possibility of women being included in all the ministries of the church.\"\nAnd when he had gone, questions remained: Was the pope inflexible? Did he recognize deep frustrations of Catholics who disagreed with church teaching on sexual matters, the roles of women and the clergy? Was there even room for discussion?\nAn Assassination Attempt\nJohn Paul's life as a robust, traveling teacher-pope appeared to have been altered on May 13, 1981, when a 23-year-old Turk, Mehmet Ali Agca, shot him as he rode in an open car before 10,000 people in St. Peter's Square. Bystanders seized the gunman as the pope's car sped away to Gemelli Hospital. Shot in the abdomen, right arm and left hand, he underwent five hours of surgery, and part of an intestine was removed.\nInvestigators searching Mr. Agca's past learned that he was a murderer who had escaped from a Turkish prison in 1979 and had ties to a neo-Nazi group, the Gray Wolves. But no evidence of a conspiracy to kill the pope was found. Mr. Agca was tried by the Italian authorities and sentenced to life in prison.\nThe assailant later said the shooting was a Soviet-inspired plot involving Bulgarian and Turkish agents, and investigators uncovered tantalizing details that seemed to support some of his assertions. But an Italian court in 1986 found the evidence ambiguous and acquitted three Bulgarians and three Turks of conspiracy in the case. A link between the attack and the Bulgarian government was often asserted, but never proved.\nThe pope publicly forgave Mr. Agca, and in 1999 the Vatican endorsed clemency. In 2000, the Italian government pardoned Mr. Agca, who was extradited to Turkey and began serving a 10-year term for the murder of a newspaper editor in 1979.\nOn May 13, 2000, exactly 19 years after the shooting, the Vatican disclosed that a vision of the attempt on the pope's life was the so-called third secret of F\u00e1tima, the last of three prophecies revealed to three Portuguese shepherd children by an apparition of the Virgin on May 13, 1917, at F\u00e1tima, Portugal.\nFatima historians say the first secret prophesied the end of World War I and the coming of World War II, while the second supposedly predicted the spread and collapse of Communism and the resurgence of Christianity in Russia. The third, written and sent to Rome by one of the three recipients, Lucia de Jesus dos Santos, who became a Carmelite nun, was kept secret by five popes.\nFascination over the secret spawned conspiracy theories and doomsday cults, with conjectures ranging from a Catholic schism with rival papacies to nuclear annihilation. Devotees of apocalypse were deflated by the Vatican explanation. The pope did not comment, though he always credited the Virgin of F\u00e1tima with sparing his life in the shooting.\nHealth, Good and Bad\nDespite the seriousness of his wounds, the pope recovered, and in the years that followed, his old vigor returned, his health was strikingly good, and he was laid low by nothing worse than influenza until July 1992, when was hospitalized for a stomach problem. It turned out to be serious. Doctors excised a tumor the size of an orange from his colon and removed his gallbladder. The tumor was in an early stage of malignancy, but no chemotherapy or other treatment was deemed necessary, and he was traveling again within three months.\nIn November 1993, there was another flutter of concern when the pope tripped on the hem of his robe and fell as he descended three steps from his throne to greet visitors at the Vatican. He suffered a fractured and dislocated right shoulder, which had to be encased in a soft cast.\nFive months later, in April 1994, he fell as he climbed from a bathtub in his Vatican apartment, fracturing and dislocating his right thighbone. Surgeons replaced part of the bone near the hip socket with metal alloys.\nThe pope fell again in 1999 on a trip to Poland, suffering a head cut that required three stitches. By then, he had grown frail and had difficulty walking, even with a cane. There were other symptoms: trembling in his left hand and slurred speech that made it hard to understand his words. Privately, officials said he had Parkinson's disease and crippling arthritis; the Vatican did not confirm the diagnoses, but there was no doubt about them.\nBy 2002, the symptoms had profoundly worsened: he could not walk without aid, his hands shook so much he could not hold his speeches, and his speech was so slurred he was almost impossible to understand. In 2003, he traveled to Spain, Croatia, Bosnia, Poland and Slovakia, but sometimes garbled words and let aides finish his speeches.\nDuring his convalescences -- from the shooting, the tumor operation and the falls -- some Vatican officials privately expressed hope that he would be forced to settle down, travel less and get more involved in the problems of running the church. But John Paul, who hated to be coddled and sometimes brushed off aides who tried to help him, was determined to continue his busy life.\nA Traveling Papacy\nSix months after the 1981 shooting, he ventured to Umbria, in central Italy, and was soon planning new travels. In 1982 he visited 12 countries in Africa, Europe and South America, and by 1983 was traveling as widely as ever. Over the next few years he went back to Africa, Europe, South America, the Caribbean and the Far East, often to third-world countries, where the church was flourishing.\nWhile he went to Africa a dozen times, he refused for years to visit South Africa because of its apartheid racial policies. But after Pretoria's peaceful transition to a non-racial Democracy, he went to Johannesburg in 1995, met President Nelson Mandela and praised the reconciliation.\nIn 1986, the pope took a particularly long and exotic journey: two weeks and 30,000 miles to Bangladesh, Singapore, Fiji, New Zealand and Australia. He was greeted by women in saris dancing to the rhythms of sitars, aborigines in loincloths and painted faces, spear-toting tribesmen who rubbed noses with him, and bare-breasted Papuan women fluttering in traditional grass skirts.\nLater that year in Calcutta, India, where countless thousands slept in streets or mud huts, he went to Mother Teresa's hospice; four people died on the day of his visit. The pope was at a loss for words as he carried food among the wasted bodies. After nine days in India, he spoke of birth control guardedly and did not criticize India's government, which advocated contraception in the face of a growing population and widespread poverty.\nThe pope's second trip to the United States, in September 1987, included stops in Miami, Columbia, S.C., New Orleans, San Antonio, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Monterey, Calif., San Francisco and Detroit. He met the nation's 300 Catholic bishops in Los Angeles, and was asked to understand the attitudes of Americans.\nIn June 1993, he addressed for the first time what many American Catholics regarded as a crisis in the making: reports of sexual abuse by priests of children and teen-agers. In a letter to American bishops, he expressed sorrow for the victims and over demoralization inflicted on the church.\nHe returned to the United States in August 1993, stopping first in Jamaica and Mexico. In four days in Denver, he met President Clinton, joined 150,000 Catholics from 70 nations at a World Youth Day festival and denounced abortion and violence. But it was the enthusiasm for the pope -- the chanting, roaring stuff of football games or rock concerts -- that made the headlines.\nA month later, the pope made his first trip to the Baltic states, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, which had been Soviet republics from 1940 to 1991. The collapse of the Soviet yoke had exposed again the tangle of nationalistic, ethnic and religious rivalries from the Baltic to the Black Sea. And while the pope called for reconciliation, his visit seemed to underscore the harsh reality that mere good will could not resolve ancient bitter enmities.\nIn 1994, he canceled a visit to Sarajevo; Radovan Karadzic, the leader of Bosnia's Serbs, said his safety could not be guaranteed. But he took his call for an end to fratricidal war to Zagreb, Croatia. The pope in 1995 seemed ubiquitous: in Asia and Oceania in January (four million people attended his outdoor Mass in Manila), in the Czech Republic and Poland in May, in Belgium in June, in Slovakia in July, in Africa in September and the United States in October.\nHis fourth journey to America, a five-day trip, took him back to New York, and for the first time to New Jersey and Maryland. As if making up for a canceled 1994 visit with an exhausting schedule, he saw Mr. Clinton, recited vespers in Newark, addressed the United Nations on its 50th anniversary and celebrated Masses at Giants Stadium in the New Jersey Meadowlands, Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens, Central Park in Manhattan and Camden Yards in Baltimore.\nDespite his growing frailty -- the slow step, the stooped shoulders, the persistent shaking hand -- the pope, always a workaholic, continued his travels: in 1996 to Venezuela, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, Tunisia, Germany, Hungary and France; in 1997 to Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Czech Republic, Lebanon, Poland, France and Brazil; and in 1998 to Cuba, Nigeria and Austria.\nIn Cuba, with President Fidel Castro at his side, the pope appealed for human rights, urged the release of political prisoners and, without citing America's 37-year economic embargo, said such sanctions hurt the needy. Months later, Cuba freed 300 political prisoners and Mr. Clinton eased restrictions on aid, direct flights to Cuba and money sent to relatives by Cuban-Americans.\nThe pope made his fifth and last trip to the United States in January 1999. After four days in Mexico, where he challenged entrenched corruption and voiced support for the poor, he went to St. Louis, his only stop, and met briefly again with Mr. Clinton, who was facing impeachment at the time, and with Rosa Parks, the heroine of the 1955 Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott. To 100,000 people, he decried the death penalty, which was favored by many American Catholics, and homelessness and the spread of gangs, drugs and sexual abuse.\nIn 1999, he went back to a liberated Poland for 13 nostalgic days. Greeted everywhere by huge, ecstatic crowds acutely aware of his place in national and world history, he prayed at the graves of his parents near Krakow, visited his hometown, Wadowice, and beatified 108 Poles killed by the Nazis. He made his final trip to his homeland in August 2002, an emotional farewell in which he asked people to pray for him.\nChallenges and Controversy\nWhile the pope's travels were the most visible aspects of his papacy, his less spectacular pronouncements and actions were no less important and often much more controversial.\nIn 1980, he caused a stir by ordering the Rev. Robert F. Drinan, a Jesuit priest who represented a Massachusetts district in Congress, not to seek re-election. Father Drinan complied, but ambiguity clouded the episode. The pope had often called politics and the priesthood incompatible, but it was not clear why Father Drinan had been singled out. Some suggested he had been made an example because many Jesuits were involved in third-world political struggles.\nAt a Synod of Bishops in Rome that year, many Western prelates openly chafed at what they saw as the pope's inflexiblity on divorce, abortion and artificial birth control. Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco cited studies showing that 76.5 percent of American Catholic women used contraceptives and that only 29 percent of American priests believed it was immoral. Other prelates argued that Catholics who used contraceptives could not be dismissed as \"obdurate, ignorant\" people. But the ripples of unrest produced no doctrinal changes.\nIndeed, stronger challenges were met with sterner measures. In 1986, the Rev. Charles E. Curran, a theologian who had dissented on birth control and other sexual questions, was stripped by the Vatican of his right to teach at the Catholic University of America after he refused to retract his views.\nOn other ethical questions, he warned of dangers he said were posed by organ transplants, genetic experiments, artificial insemination, birth and fertility controls, and new drugs. On another matter, he conceded -- 350 years after the fact -- that the church had been wrong to persecute Galileo for saying the earth circles the sun, not the other way around. Seeking to rectify an infamous case of dogma over reason, the pope in 1992 said the astronomer-physicist should not have been forced in 1633, under threat of death, to recant his discoveries.\nIn 1996, the pope also acknowledged that the human body might not have been the immediate creation of God, but was the product of evolution, which he called \"more than just a hypothesis.\" The church had never condemned Darwin, but had warned that his ideas played into the hands of materialists and atheists.\nWhile confronting external church problems, John Paul also moved within by changing its hierarchy. His appointments of John J. O'Connor and his successor, Edward M. Egan, as archbishop in New York; Bernard F. Law as archbishop in Boston; and Francis E. George to replace Cardinal Joseph Bernardin as archbishop in Chicago drew the liberal American church back to more conservative ground.\nHe further internationalized the Sacred College of Cardinals, which for centuries had a disproportionate number of Italians, by appointing many new cardinals from the third world. In 1994, he appointed 30 cardinals from 24 nations, bringing to 62 the number of nations represented; he appointed 22 more cardinals in 1998, 42 more in 2001 and 31 more in 2003.\nThe pope had a good relationship with the administration of President Ronald Reagan, which opened an embassy to the Holy See in 1984. But he rebuffed its claim that he backed its Central America policies, including aid to the rebels known as contras who fought the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua. The pope held that Central American nations should work out their own problems.\nHis posture toward the two Bush administrations and the Clinton administration was cordial, but strained by the pope's opposition to the Persian Gulf war in 1991, Mr. Clinton's support of abortion rights and the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.\nSimilarly, the pope often urged peace in the Middle East and said he looked with sympathy on Israelis and Palestinians, whose traditions, he said, \"should be granted equal respect.\" But his appeals never proposed concrete solutions to their age-old problems.\nPoland was an exception to his balanced, above-the-fray pronouncements. In 1980, he sang a Polish patriotic hymn in St. Peter's Square and vowed, \"We in Rome are united with our countrymen in Poland.\" He often voiced support for the outlawed Solidarity union, calling it a model for human rights struggles.\nTo laymen who opposed autocratic regimes, the pope usually urged restraint, and to warring rebels he pleaded for a farewell to arms. In Peru, he urged the guerrillas of the Maoist Shining Path movement to follow \"the roads of dialogue and not those of violence.\"\nThe pope also issued emotional appeals to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and President George H.W. Bush before the 1991 attack on Iraqi forces in Kuwait. In 2003, he urged that the United Nations take the lead in countering Mr. Hussein. While papal statements often sounded antiwar, he denied that he favored a pacifist rejection of all warfare, noting that states had a right to defend themselves.\nWith the collapse of Soviet Communism, John Paul's long crusade against its political and economic tyrannies seemed to be over. But he was still troubled by what he saw as its unpalatable successors -- unbridled Western capitalism and Communism returning by stealth in Eastern Europe. And he seemed to have no special perspective on the friction between Islam and the West that followed the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\nA Promising Early Life\nSpiritually, Karol Jozef Wojtyla was never far from the land of his birth. He was born on May 18, 1920, in Wadowice, 30 miles southwest of Krakow, the second of two children in a strict Catholic family. His mother, Emilia Kaczorowska Wojtyla, of Lithuanian descent, died when he was 9. His father, Karol Wojtyla, was a sergeant in the Polish Army's quartermaster corps.\nYoung Karol was a good student in elementary and secondary schools, with a talent for languages and an interest in poetry, drama and literature. He also excelled in athletics, playing goalkeeper on his school soccer team, and in dramatics. He was popular with teachers and classmates, who called him Karolek (Little Charles) or Lolek.\nHis family was not well off. An old school employee recalled that \"Karolek always wore blue trousers that had clearly been cut from his father's discarded uniforms.\" When he was 18, his father, who had retired with a small pension, moved the family from Wadowice to Krakow. Karol's brother, Edmund, a doctor, died before the outbreak of World War II.\nAfter high school, Karol enrolled at Jagiellonian University in Krakow. But in 1939, the invading Nazis closed the university. His studies interrupted, he took a job in a stone quarry to help his ailing father make ends meet. Later, he found a laborer's job at the Solvay Chemical Works, where he helped organize a plant cafeteria.\nThe factory job provided him with a work card that protected him from deportation to a labor camp in German-occupied Poland. His fellow workers remembered him as already deeply religious: he could often be seen praying during rest periods.\nOutside work, he fell in with other young intellectuals and, with a friend, founded an underground drama group, the Rhapsodic Theater. Its productions were staged in homes, with Karol playing leads before small audiences of students and artists. Some early friends said that acting was his first love and that they had been surprised to see him turn to the priesthood.\nHe had a rich baritone voice and liked to sing popular songs at parties, accompanying himself on the guitar. He also wrote plays and poetry. One of his dramas, a morality play called \"The Goldsmith's Shop\" written under the pen name Andrzej Jawien, was translated into Italian and broadcast over Italian radio after the playwright became pope; it was also made into a 1987 film.\nHis father's death in 1941 deeply distressed the young man. A close friend at the time was Jan Tyranowski, a tailor and a mystic who introduced him to the works of St. John of the Cross, a Spanish Carmelite mystical monk. Later, the future pope would write a postgraduate thesis on St. John.\nThere were reports that Karol Wojtyla was a member of the Polish resistance in World War II. Mieczyslaw Malinski, a friend who became a priest, scoffed at the accounts. He said that members of the underground had asked them both to join the fight against the Nazis, but that the two had declined. But Joseph L. Lichten, of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith in Rome, said that a Karol Wojtyla was active in a clandestine group that worked with the Christian Democratic movement Unia, which had a record of helping Jews, and that he had been put on a blacklist by the Germans.\nWhatever the case, there is no proof that the future pope did any fighting after leaving his factory job in 1942. What is known is that he studied for the priesthood clandestinely, taking underground Jagiellonian University courses and attending others at the Spiritual Seminary directed by Krakow's archbishop, Adam Stefan Sapieha, who became his patron. For the rest of the war, he lived in the basement of his patron's fortress-like palace.\nIn that period, he had two serious injuries. Knocked down by a streetcar on Tyniecka Street, he suffered a fractured skull. Later, he was almost crushed by a runaway truck, an accident that left him stoop-shouldered.\nA Priest and Prelate\nHe was ordained a priest on Nov. 1, 1946. As the Communists took power in postwar Poland, Archbishop Sapieha urged his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to continue postgraduate studies abroad. Father Wojtyla was sent to Rome, where he enrolled at the Angelicum, a college operated by the Dominican order.\nIn two years he had earned a doctorate in philosophy, writing his thesis on \"Problems of the Faith According to St. John of the Cross.\" After traveling in France and Belgium, he returned home and was assigned by the archbishop as assistant pastor in a village parish in Niegowic, in southern Poland.\nA year later, he was sent back to Krakow as an assistant at St. Florian's Church and to continue his theological studies. In 1953, he earned a second doctorate, in moral theology, and qualified as an instructor. He first lectured on social ethics at the Spiritual Seminary in Krakow; a year later he won a chair in social ethics at Catholic University in Lublin. It was a post he would retain until he became pope.\nHis reputation as a church intellectual grew rapidly, and in 1958 he was consecrated auxiliary bishop of Krakow under Archbishop Eugeniusz Baziak. At 38, he was the youngest member of the Polish church hierarchy. After the death of Archbishop Baziak in 1962, he was designated the acting archbishop, and on Jan. 13, 1964, Pope Paul VI made him archbishop of Krakow.\nDuring Vatican II, Archbishop Wojtyla addressed council fathers in Rome on eight occasions, was instrumental in the adoption of a declaration on religious liberty and was active in committee work. In his most notable council speech, he contended that the church could not lay claim to religious liberty without conceding it to others.\n\"It is not the church's task to teach unbelievers,\" he said. He warned against moralizing and authoritarian postures, saying the church should not \"cry over the lamentable state of the world\" or pretend that it had \"all the answers to all the problems in it.\" He impressed the cardinals as a practical philosopher and drew the attention of the pope.\nOn June 26, 1967, Pope Paul VI elevated Archbishop Wojtyla to the College of Cardinals. At that time, Poland's Communist government regarded him as moderate and flexible, in contrast to Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski, the longtime patriarch of Warsaw, a hard-line anti-Communist.\nIn later years, that perception was reversed. While Cardinal Wyszynski remained viscerally anti-Marxist, he began cooperating with the government on nonideological social and economic programs advantageous to the church and the Polish people. Cardinal Wojtyla, meantime, became a tough, vocal and eloquent opponent of the government, demanding increased freedoms in education, mass media and human rights and preaching Christian alternatives to Marxism.\nIn 1969, Cardinal Wojtyla made his first trip to the United States, visiting Polish-American communities in 15 cities. \"Almost everywhere we went,\" said a priest who accompanied him, \"he laid aside his prepared remarks and spoke from the heart.\"\nCardinal Wojtyla returned to America in 1976, visiting 16 cities, including Cambridge, Mass., where Thomas E. Crooks, director of Harvard's summer school, recalled being \"floored by the sheer physical presence\" of the man. As Mr. Crooks remembered: \"He exuded such a combination of power and acceptance. He had this smile on his face and a look in his eye that said, 'You're wonderful. And I'm wonderful, too.' We had dinner with him later, and late that evening I told myself, 'This man ought to be pope.\"'\nA Literary Presence\nJohn Paul's literary output was prodigious. Besides his encyclicals, he was the author of at least seven books -- some bibliographies, counting his published commentaries, list as many as 11 -- and more than 300 articles and essays, most of them in scholarly journals.\nIn the study of his archdiocesan residence on Franciszkanska Street in Krakow, a visitor in 1978 found 1,500 books on the shelves, including the works of ancient and modern philosophers, leaders of the church in Greek and Latin, and 20th-century avant-garde theologians, as well as volumes on many subjects in various languages. One of the few novels was \"The Shoes of the Fisherman,\" Morris West's 1963 tale of a pope from the Soviet Union.\nBooks by the future pope included \"The Foundations of Renewal,\" a 1957 work on philosophical and moral subjects; \"Love and Responsibility,\" originally lectures on sex, marriage and birth control, which was published in 1962; and \"The Acting Person,\" a 1969 phenomenological treatise. His output as pope included \"Sign of Contradiction,\" a 1979 spiritual testament, and \"The Future of the Church,\" a study of Vatican II directives, which appeared in English in 1979.\nA collection of essays, \"Crossing the Threshold of Hope,\" was published in October 1994 in 21 languages in 35 countries -- in English by Alfred A. Knopf. Knopf's parent, Random House, paid a $9 million advance, and the book was on the best-seller lists in America for months. The pope donated the revenue to charity. A commercially published book by a sitting pope was unheard of in modern times. Experts say the last such publication, other than speeches, teaching documents and other official communications, was a 1748 work on diocesan synods by Pope Benedict XIV.\nJohn Paul's last book, \"Memory and Identity,\" published this year, discussed freedom, patriotism and European integration. Last year, 25 European countries signed a constitution that does not mention the continent's Christian roots, despite the Vatican's repeated calls that it do so.\nHe also wrote a great deal of poetry. A collection of his free verse was published by Random House in 1979 as \"Easter Vigil and Other Poems,\" and \"Roman Triptych -- Meditations,\" appeared in 2003.\nOne poem published in Krakow under the pen name Andrzej Jawien was titled \"The Rock.\" Written after a stroll in St. Peter's Square, it reads in translation:\nIn this place our feet meet with earth from which so many walls and columns spring.\nIf you don't get lost among them\nBut go on finding oneness and meaning,\nIt's because that very earth leads you.\nHere she not only bridges\nThe spaces of a Renaissance building\nBut also vaults interiors within ourselves\nWho grow so very conscious of our weaknesses and failures.\nIt's you, Peter. You want to serve as the substratum here for those who stagger\nToward some unknown goal, to make them go where you would lead their feet\nSo that spaces can be bridged through sight that helps thought to be born.\nYou want to be the one to serve the feet, just as a rock serves the hoofs of sheep:\nThe rock is also the substratum of this gigantic temple.\nThe pasture is the cross.\nIn his homeland, he also left a major monument to his faith and perseverance: the starkly modern Church of Our Lady, Queen of Poland, which rises at Nowa Huta, the new iron and steel center east of Krakow. While the authorities had long opposed the project in the Communist era, voluntary contributions were raised, and scarce building materials were scraped together. Somehow construction permits were obtained and volunteer workers took turns at the building site.\nIt took more than a decade, but the project was dedicated in 1977. In a homily at the time, the future pope declared that men had a right to more than a job and a living wage.\n\"There are more profound rights of the human spirit that cannot be violated,\" he said. \"These are the rights of freedom of the human spirit, freedom of human conscience, freedom of belief and freedom of religion.\"",

The past always catches up with you; blood is thicker than water; be careful what you wish for. These are among the stale-but-true bromides that are acknowledged by the title character in Donald Margulies's sincere but doggedly unsurprising new play about the midlife crisis of a suddenly successful novelist (Adam Arkin). While this comic drama is steeped in an admirably humble and often touching spirit of acceptance, it seldom does what Mr. Margulies has achieved repeatedly before: make the familiar seem fresh. Polly Draper and Ari Graynor stand out in an excellent cast, smoothly directed by Daniel Sullivan (2:20). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $26 to $79. BEN BRANTLEY\n+'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in David Leveaux's placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Heard not so long ago issuing from the plus-size form of Edna Turnblad in the musical \"Hairspray,\" Mr. Fierstein's voice is one of the most distinctive in theater, variously evoking a kazoo, a congested saxophone, wind in a bottle and echoes from a crypt. It is, in a way, its own multicolored show. Whether it fits comfortably into the little Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to Mr. Leveaux's abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $100. BRANTLEY\n+'GOOD VIBRATIONS' Even those who believe that everything on this planet has a purpose may at first have trouble justifying the existence of \"Good Vibrations,\" the singing headache that manages to purge all catchiness from the surpassingly catchy hits of the Beach Boys. But audience members strong enough to sit through this rickety jukebox of a show will discover that the production, directed and choreographed by John Carrafa, does have a reason to be. \"Good Vibrations\" sacrifices itself to make all other musicals on Broadway look good. As the show's washboard-stomached performers smile, wriggle and squeak with the desperation of wet young things hung out to dry, you feel their pain. It is unlikely, however, to be more acute than yours (2:15). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $76 to $101; a limited number of $25 student rush tickets are available at the box office on the day of the show. BRANTLEY\n+'LITTLE WOMEN' Sutton Foster never merely walks when she can scamper in this perky, sketchy adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel of a Civil War-era New England girlhood. Portraying Jo the tomboy, Ms. Foster creates a dizzyingly hyperkinetic creature who, were she living in the 21st century, would probably be on Ritalin. Ms. Foster (a Tony winner for \"Thoroughly Modern Millie\") shows a gift for fresh, comic line readings. But her energy is often less infectious than exhausting. The same can be said of the show, directed by Susan H. Schulman and featuring a book by Allan Knee, with songs by Jason Howland and Mindi Dickstein. Watching the production is rather like speed-reading Alcott's novel. And the cast members, who include the mellow-voiced Maureen McGovern, mostly bring to mind 1860's-themed editions of the American Girl series of dolls (2:20). Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $100. BRANTLEY\nOff Broadway\n+'BELFAST BLUES' The \"Belfast Blues\" of Geraldine Hughes's solo show aren't the kind you'd expect. Yes, the \"troubles\" between Roman Catholics and Protestants that have roiled Northern Ireland for decades do cast an emotional shadow over this heartfelt and funny if unexceptional stage memoir, descriptively subtitled \"one wee girl's story about family, war, Jesus and Hollywood.\" But Ms. Hughes's title more directly refers to her big, inquisitive and exceptionally expressive eyes, which helped secure that wee girl a ticket to a happier life. \"Belfast Blues,\" which recounts her experience growing up amid poverty and violence in Belfast in the 1970's and 80's, does not bring any groundbreaking insights to familiar territory. But Ms. Hughes is a bright, inviting presence, and the surprising agent of her deliverance from the troubled atmosphere of her youth gives the show a modestly refreshing twist (1:25). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 4 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $45; a limited number of $20 student rush tickets are available at the box office one hour before the performance. CHARLES ISHERWOOD\n'THE CHERRY ORCHARD' In this stunningly powerful production, an intriguing balance arises between Lopakhin, the bourgeois former serf, and the aristocratic family that owns the cherry orchard and whose fortunes are all but dried up. The landowner Lyubov Ranevskaya (Petronia Paley), returning penniless from her life abroad, is as elegant as she is self-delusional. Against her beauty and her dignity, Lopakhin (Wendell Pierce), the archetype of the small-minded arriviste, is a hard man to like. But this production brings out their shared past in subtle but forceful gestures that complicate the audience's sympathies (2:00). Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212)868-4444. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25. CAMPBELL ROBERTSON\n'COUNSELLOR-AT-LAW' Entertainment in abundance radiates from the Peccadillo Theater Company's new production of this old Elmer Rice drama. Starring the Tony Award-winning John Rubinstein, \"Counsellor-at-Law\" is a drama that throbs with New York life and brims with touchstones of another time, like \"George White's Scandals\" and the Court of General Sessions. But it also retains relevance to ambition and success in the 21st century. It has a hero worth rooting for, a healthy dose of sacred and profane love, some sharp jabs at class difference, villains who merit a hearty hiss and plenty of New York attitude and humor (2:45). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $55; $20 student rush tickets available at the box office 15 minutes before the show. LAWRENCE VAN GELDER\n*'THE GODS ARE POUNDING MY HEAD! (AKA LUMBERJACK MESSIAH)' Even lumberjacks get the cosmic blues in the world of Richard Foreman, the Florenz Ziegfeld of avant-garde drama. In many ways, this show is a typical Foreman extravaganza: tightly orchestrated hallucinogenic visual effects, bruising slapstick and cryptic, fragmented dialogue. But there is also a newly wistful, elegiac note here. \"Gods,\" which features Jay Smith and T. Ryder Smith as a pair of weary woodsmen, is as majestically mad and funny as any Foreman spectacle. But it also has a sadness appropriate to what appears to be a farewell note of sorts, since Mr. Foreman has said he is giving up the kind of plays he has been creating since 1968 to focus on film (1:10). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, (212)533-4650. Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, 8 p.m. Tickets: weekdays $20, $15 for students; $25 for Saturday performances. BRANTLEY\n'A LIFE A BROAD (MI VIDA EN JIRA)' Melanie Rey has a big bright voice, and her one-woman show is a musical. She style-surfs through multiple styles in English and Spanish: ballads, Anglo rock, R&B and Tex-Mex. She is an accomplished actor too, but the word \"accomplished\" often means that an actor with all the right moves shows them all too predictably. A one-person 90-minute show needs more. Ms Rey's real talent comes through unstrained when she plays her passionate, husband-hunting mother. When she plays herself, she is working too hard to win our love (1:30). Greenwich Street Theater, 547 Greenwich Street, (212) 252-2439. Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m.; Mondays at 8 p.m. Tickets: $30. MARGO JEFFERSON\n+'SABINA' Once a forgotten ghost in the annals of psychoanalysis, Sabina Spielrein is proving to have surprising staying power. A patient of Carl Jung and an acquaintance of Sigmund Freud who ultimately became a psychoanalyst herself, Spielrein has a history that has provided material for two movies and two plays. The first of these was Willy Holtzman's \"Sabina,\" first produced by Primary Stages in 1996 and now in revival as part of the company's 20th-anniversary season. The new production, directed by Ethan McSweeny, is hampered by an unsatisfactory performance from Marin Ireland in the title role. But the history of Spielrein's relationships with the founder of psychoanalysis and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 turned apostate is nonetheless engrossing. It provides a provocative window into the much-studied relationship between Freud and Jung. Peter Strauss gives an admirably understated performance as a paternalistic Freud, and Victor Slezak, as Jung, gives persuasive dramatic life to a now-mythic figure. (2:15). Primary Stages, at 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays though Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55. ISHERWOOD\n'SHYLOCK' Deconstructing Shakespeare is a dangerous sport; it's impossible to be more imaginative or clever than the playwright himself, even if you are Harold Bloom. Gareth Armstrong gives it a game try, but \"Shylock,\" his 80-minute dissertation on the evolution of one of Shakespeare's most memorable characters, although deftly performed, is no exception. While his pocket synopses of anti-Semitism, Elizabethan England, Marlowe's \"Jew of Malta\" and even a Baedeker of famous actors' renditions of Shylock are edifying, they are not sufficiently enlightening or entertaining. The most riveting lines of Mr. Armstrong's monologue belong to Shakespeare himself (1:35). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212)868-4444. Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $55; a limited number of $20 student/senior rush tickets available at the box office 30 minutes before the performance. PHOEBE HOBAN\n++'SLEEPING BEAUTY' Trust a British \"Sleeping Beauty\" to pivot on a fairy's flatulence. Yes, that surefire laugh trigger in old Blighty plays an unexpectedly large role in Rufus Norris's murky new version of the familiar fairy tale for the Young Vic Theater Company. Mr. Norris, a talented young British director whose Broadway-bound production of \"Festen\" snapped up many London theater awards, isn't interested in pretty pictures. His vigorously staged, grotesquely comic \"Sleeping Beauty,\" which unfolds in smoky darkness beneath a queasy yellow moon, is entirely in tune with the current vogue for teasing out thickets of disturbing subtext in children's literature. The production's eccentric designs accentuate the predominantly eerie air (2:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. Tonight at 7; tomorrow and Sunday at 1 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $10, $20 and $30. ISHERWOOD\n*'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as standup existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. This monologue, which runs just over an hour and requires minimal stagecraft, is as unassuming in its means as it is astonishing in its impact. It's one of those treasured nights in the theater -- treasured nights anywhere, for that matter -- that can leave you both breathless with exhilaration and, depending on your sensitivity to meditations on the bleak and beautiful mysteries of human experience, in a puddle of tears. Also in stitches, here and there. Mr. Eno and his performer, the actor James Urbaniak, hereby reinvent that seemingly moribund theatrical genre, the solo show. They are immeasurably aided by the work of the director Hal Brooks. Mr. Eno's voice, or the voice of the narrator/protagonist/master of ceremonies played by Mr. Urbaniak, is alternately lyrical and affectless, ecstatic and flat, sardonic and sincere. Standup-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative: Mr. Eno might be called a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation. Let's try that again, minus the conditional: Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 6 and 9 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets; $45. ISHERWOOD\n*'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' This lovably inconsequential, entirely adorable new musical brings to the stage the culture's current mania for celebrating that most revered of American virtues, the will to victory. A mock spelling bee, it pokes serious fun at its twitchy tween contestants -- in the loopy spirit of the movies \"Waiting for Guffman\" and \"Best in Show\" -- but also pays affectionate tribute to these quirky young spelling titans. William Finn's nimble, upbeat score provides the emotional underpinning for Rachel Sheinkin's more satirical -- indeed often riotously funny -- book. The director James Lapine, Mr. Finn's collaborator on \"Falsettos,\" is also in impeccable form, managing to transform into virtues two of the theater's most reliable pitfalls, namely audience participation and the usually ghastly conceit of adult actors' playing kids (1:45). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)246-4422. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $75. ISHERWOOD\n'WE'RE STILL HOT' A sign onstage in this melodramatic musical reads \"Welcome back, class of 1970,\" but this is misleading. The show is not about the experience of a class reunion. It is about a musical revue being written for that reunion, starring three old high school friends, now in their 50's, and a Hungarian cleaning woman who happens to be passing by. One alumna is a successful businesswoman (Deirdre Kingsbury), one is a rich man's uptight wife (Marnee Hollis), one is a complete failure (Deborah Jean Templin), and the pushy cleaning woman (Jane Seaman) was a stage star back home. J.J. McColl, the playwright and lyricist, makes Act I painful, with numbers like \"Nothing Special\" (it certainly isn't), \"Hormones\" and \"Whirligig Glands.\" Things improve a bit in Act II, as the humor turns to the ravages of aging (2:00). Theater at St. Luke's, 308 West 46th Street, (212)352-3101. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55. ANITA GATES\n'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater. It is always paying homage to itself. Parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs is smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get In the case of \"The Musical of Musicals!\" Two of the performers are also the creators: Joanne Bogart (lyrics) and Eric Rockwell. (music). Aided by Lovette George and Craig Fols, they offer spoofs in the styles of Rodgers and Hammerstein, Stephen Sondheim, Jerry Herman, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Kander and Ebb. The best parodists don't sneer, they tease, and share the form's joie de vivre.\" Aficianados will get every joke and neophytes will laugh too. \"The Musical of Musicals!\" creates its own lightly absurd world (90 minutes). Dodger Stages, 340 West 5oth Street, (212)239-6200. Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 4 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $59.50. JEFFERSON\nOff Off Broadway\n'DAY OF RECKONING' This play about the anarchist and labor reformer Lucy Parsons is unevenly paced and clumsily staged, but it has this saving grace: unlike some other theatrical efforts associated with Black History Month, it is not shallow hero worship. Parsons was a decidedly flawed hero, and Melody Cooper, the playwright, leaves those flaws in plain sight. As a young woman, Parsons, played by Ms. Cooper, called herself Lucy Gonzalez and tried to pass as Mexican and American Indian, chafing at any suggestion that she was black. And in her militant-labor phase, with her white husband, Albert, she exhorted followers, \"Learn to use explosives.\" When the Parsonses' domestic bliss is shattered by the Haymarket Riot of 1886, Lucy loses her bearings, and her son pays an appalling price. Ms. Cooper's recounting of this fascinating life could benefit from a large infusion of understatement, but still, Parsons's story is one that deserves to be told, especially at a time when those with radical ideas are again under intense scrutiny (1:50). All Stars Project's Performing Arts and Education Center, 543 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)941-1234. Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $15. NEIL GENZLINGER\n'THE FLID SHOW' With the drug Vioxx making headlines because of its recent recall over adverse side effects, Richard Willett's play gains an unsettling topicality. The play traces the history of Thalidomide, the sleeping pill widely distributed in Europe in the late 1950's and early 60's that caused birth defects when taken by pregnant women. Mat Fraser, a seasoned and charismatic British actor who was himself a \"Thalidomide baby,\" stars as Duncan, a lounge singer coming to grips with the anger and resentment fueled by his lifelong struggles. In Mr. Willett's fanciful dramatic scheme -- borrowed from a certain Dickens holiday favorite, as he acknowledges -- Duncan's psychological scars are healed by a series of ghostly visitors who sweep him through time and space. The documentary aspects of the play are absorbing and often poignant, but Duncan's personal story, centering on his rocky romance with a doctor and a reconciliation, in spirit at least, with his dead mother, is crudely drawn and clich\u00e9d (2:15). Medicine Show Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212)352-3101. Fridays, Saturdays and Mondays at 8 p.m. Tickets: $15; $30 for a special benefit performance on Feb. 24. ISHERWOOD\n'THE SECRET NARRATIVE OF THE PHONE BOOK' Spouting cascades of words, like fireboats expelling water in a harbor parade, the four actors in Gordon Cox's satiric new play manage to keep the pressure high for the first half of the evening's 90 minutes. It's a feat, because the self-described \"romantic comedy hijacked by a conspiracy thriller\" ultimately falls victim to overearnest lecturing and a convoluted plot about media control by a Big Brother phone company. Still, the fact that Mr. Cox, a theater critic for Newsday, obviously loves language, makes the early scenes a kick to hear (1:30). Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, (212)868-4444. Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; added performance Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $15; $8 for students. ANDREA STEVENS\nLast Chance\n'THE CONFESSIONS OF PUNCH AND JUDY' The anarchist Punch and his wife, Judy, have been beating each other senseless for centuries, but while the famously warring married couple is usually performed by puppets, two real-life actors do the quarreling in this rigorously performed modern update with a surplus of energy and a deficit of direction. Ker Wells and Tannis Kowalchuk, who wrote the drama with the director Raymond Bobgan, play the pair in this pedestrian production, which mixes mime, ballroom dance, first-person monologues, puppetry and naturalistic acting (1:10). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212)868-4444. Tonight, tomorrow and, final performance, Sunday at 7 p.m. Tickets: $15. JASON ZINOMAN\n'BYE MOM! OR, HOW NOT TO BURY YOUR MOTHER' This tongue-in-cheek comedy is the debut play of Susan Austin Roth, whose gardening books have sold more than 1.5 million copies. Its eye-catching title hints at Ms. Roth's experience writing guide books and it's easy to see a commercial, if still green, sensibility in the play's broad comic caricatures When Ethel falls into a coma, her children fly down to her home in Florida and take this opportunity to really let the old woman have it. But two hours of complaints aren't just for petty revenge. It also allows the family to dredge up old fights, reveal secrets and embrace in the end -- you know, the way families do in contrived two act-plays. Ms Roth has written what feels like a rough draft with potential (2:00). 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, (212)279-4200. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $15. ZINOMAN\n'FINDING CLAIRE' In Kim Merrill's lovely, sensitive, engrossing one-act play, Geneva Carr does a remarkable thing. She begins to cry, so suddenly and so intensely, that the audience laughs. Then her pain asserts itself and the audience sympathizes. Finally, she turns little-girlish (\"She was really nice,\" she says of her dead mother. \"Not like here with you\"), and the audience laughs again. It's a neat trick that takes theatergoers along for the character's roller-coaster ride of emotion. Ms. Carr plays an affluent 30-ish New York dancer who seeks out her birth mother, Claire Defaux (Deirdre Madigan), and finds a new family with old problems. Helen Gallagher plays Claire's domineering mother; Shana Dowdeswell is Claire's 15-year-old pregnant daughter. The cast is outstanding, if not fully convincing as lower middle class. Ms. Merrill's graceful script and Susan Einhorn's assured direction smooth over the twinges of mild disbelief (1:15). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at East 10th Street, (212)254-1109. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $10. ANITA GATES\n'PYRETOWN' There is plenty in John Belluso's play that resonates about the lack of universal health care in this country and the harsh consequences for many Americans -- as seen through two characters: Louise, a welfare mother (the waiflike Deirdre O'Connell) , and Harry, a disabled Web designer (the adroit Christopher Thornton), who falls in love with Louise. But Mr. Belluso would do better to leave his message in the hands of his characters and let them deliver it in their own way (80 min). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212)868-4444. Tonight and tomorrow at 8; final performance, Sunday at 2 p.m.. Tickets: $19. STEVENS\n'WASTED (THE MYSTERY/HISTORY OF PUBLIC EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND HOW IT GOT THAT WAY)' In \"Wasted,\" the Irondale Ensemble Project tries to answer a very difficult question: How do you make a play about the history of the public school system in American without being terribly boring? While they came up with a number of solutions, none were satisfactory. History is reduced to good guys and bad guys, who both talk in slogans: should school teach kids to think for themselves or prepare them for the workforce? The decline of the school system is told simply as a story of dark conspiracies motivated by corporate greed. In the end, you get the sense that this show is made by people who have spent little time reflecting on the ideas of the other side (2:00).

When Mr. Cameron proclaimed himself \"king of the world\" on winning the Oscar for \"Titanic,\" who knew that he also had designs on the rest of the solar system? His newest film is a grandiose hybrid of undersea documentary and outer-space fantasy that begins on our planet's ocean floor and ends many miles under the ice crust that covers Europa, the second moon of Jupiter. The movie's sneaky transition from undersea documentary to speculative fantasy of a journey yet to be undertaken is so seamless that you could easily mistake the last portion of the film for the record of an actual space voyage. Mr. Cameron's theory, supported by astrobiologists, is that the life forms found at the deepest levels of the ocean where no light from the sun penetrates may hold clues to the nature of possible life in outer space. Filmed in Imax 3-D, it is a visual adventure worthy of that much-degraded adjective, awesome. STEPHEN HOLDEN\n'THE AVIATOR' Starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Directed by Martin Scorsese (PG-13, 169 minutes). The famously eccentric and reclusive empire builder Howard Hughes was born alone and died alone -- two times when he was no different from anyone else. For the rest of his life, the high-flying Hughes seemed to have drifted in from some distant aerie, where exotic birds hatch far from everyday worries. At the age of 18, he was both an orphan and a millionaire, and while he could never be called ordinary, in the following two decades his wealth and all that it afforded brought him a very American kind of celebrity. It is that celebrity, fueled by money, stoked by matinee looks and playboy style, that preoccupies \"The Aviator,\" Mr. Scorsese's visually sumptuous if disappointingly hollow account of Hughes's early life. Written by John Logan, the story principally covers the late 20's through the 40's, when Hughes, played by Mr. DiCaprio, was gadding about both Hollywood and the aviation world. MANOHLA DARGIS\n'BOOGEYMAN' Starring Barry Watson. Directed by Stephen Kay (PG-13, 86 minutes). There are a lot of close-ups of doorknobs and water faucets in Mr. Kay's would-be horror film. There is a supernaturally speedy killing accomplished with heavy-duty plastic wrap. There is frequent whooshing and rapid camera movement. Despite all of that, it isn't scary. Mr. Watson, of \"Seventh Heaven,\" plays Tim, a grown man who has been afraid of the boogeyman ever since he was 8, when something creepy sucked his father into a closet and out of this life. After his mother's death, Tim vows to spend a night in his childhood home to allay his fears, but, sure enough, the boogeyman is back and after him and everyone he cares about (well, an uncle and two girlfriends). The house is very creaky; so is the movie. ANITA GATES\n'BRIDE AND PREJUDICE' Starring Martin Henderson and Aishwarya Rai. Directed by Gurinder Chadha (PG-13, 111 minutes). Because Ms. Chadha knows how to sell multiplex multiculturalism -- her last feature was \"Bend It Like Beckham\" -- the pitch for her new film probably ran something along the lines of: \"Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' recontextualized as a Bollywood musical (only shorter) and set against the backdrop of the new global economy.\" Whatever the case, the new film -- which transposes Austen's 1813 novel to 21st-century India, with layovers in swinging London and sunny Los Angeles -- is as high concept and rife with clich\u00e9 as anything churned out by Hollywood, but with worse production values and a load of sanctimony. Think \"My Big Fat Sari Wedding\" tricked out with clumsy song-and-dance numbers and delivered with much finger-wagging about cultural tolerance. The kicker here being that the wagging finger belongs to the story's heroine, here called Lalita (Ms. Rai, radiantly beautiful but inert), and the object of her high-mindedness is none other than a wealthy American, Will Darcy (Mr. Henderson, just inert). DARGIS\n'COACH CARTER' Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Rob Brown and Rick Gonzalez. Directed by Thomas Carter (PG-13, 137 minutes). In this solid, unsurprising inspirational-coach drama, Mr. Jackson plays Ken Carter, who returns to his old high school in the tough Northern California city of Richmond to turn a squad of underachieving misfits into winners, both on and off the court. Based on a true story, the movie combines sports-picture suspense with heroic-educator uplift when Carter, dismayed that his players are slipping academically, padlocks the gym in the midst of an undefeated season. Mr. Carter (the director, not related to the coach) infuses this sentimental warhorse with some flourishes of realism, which are bolstered by the hip-hop soundtrack and by the performances of the younger cast members, especially Mr. Brown as a talented forward struggling with his responsibilities, Ashanti as his girlfriend, and Mr. Gonzalez as a player sliding toward a life of crime. A.O.SCOTT\n*'HEAD-ON' Starring Birol Unel, Sibel Kekilli and Guven Kirac. Directed by Fatih Akin (Not rated, 118 minutes; in German and Turkish, with English subtitles). Love doesn't just hurt in this jagged German romance; it cuts and bleeds and even kills. A story about a lonely man and a still-lonelier woman fighting against their worlds and what often seems like their own best interests, the film has caused a stir in Germany for the murky, troubling light it sheds on the lives of the country's Turkish immigrants. Its popularity made it a fleeting social phenomenon and a minor cultural footnote. But it doesn't explain why this film about two strangers with suicidal tendencies and a deep commitment to self-aggrandizing drama is the first very good movie of this very young year. One of the truisms about romances, even those shaded pitch black and set to banging rock music, is that you have to fall in love with the characters when they're falling for each other. It takes a long time for Cahit (Mr. Unel) and Sibel (Ms. Kekilli) to get inside each other's heads, much less anywhere else, but it doesn't take us long to care about these two perfectly imperfect beings. DARGIS\n'HIDE AND SEEK' Starring Robert De Niro, Dakota Fanning, and Amy Irving. . Directed by John Polson. (R, 105 minutes). In this downbeat, sufficiently unsettling film, Mr. De Niro plays a New York City shrink, David, who's married to a somnolent type (Ms. Irving), whose love for their daughter, Emily (Ms. Fanning), can't disguise her unhappiness. Soon after the story starts, violence descends on the family, and David and Emily move to the country for some healing. Once there, things go from lousy to worse, as Emily starts staring blankly into the surrounding woods and palling around with a sinister invisible friend called Charlie. Blood drips into the story; then it pours. One of the most gifted child actors around, Ms. Fanning has both chops and a preternaturally intense screen presence; even when you don't believe the setup, you buy what she is selling. That's a good thing when it comes to this horror-thriller hybrid, which was written by Ari Schlossberg and needs all the help it can get from its actors. DARGIS\n'HITCH' Starring Will Smith, Eva Mendes, Kevin James and Amber Valetta. Directed by Andy Tennant (PG-13, 115 minutes). As soft and sweet as a marshmallow, and about as interesting, this genial romantic comedy features the ever-charming Mr. Smith as a dating coach who helps hapless Manhattan men snag women much better looking than they are. His own head is turned by Ms. Mendes, playing surely the most kindly gossip columnist ever to grace the pages of a New York tabloid. Complications, as always, ensue, but nothing too challenging or painful, either for the central couple or for the audience. Mr. James, best known as the portly King of Queens on television, is around for comic relief as an especially needy client, who is smitten with the willowy Ms. Valletta. SCOTT\n'LOST EMBRACE' Starring Daniel Hendler, Adriana Aizenberg and Atilio Pozzob\u00f3n. Directed by Daniel Burman (not rated, 100 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). Set in a shabby Buenos Aires shopping mall, this antic, melancholy comedy gives a Latin American twist to a story of young, male Jewish identity crisis that will be familiar to fans of Philip Roth, Neil Simon and Woody Allen. Ariel (the fast-moving, nervous-looking Mr. Hendler) is a young man in a hurry, without much of a sense of direction. He carries on an anxious affair with an older woman, pines for his former girlfriend, and fantasizes about emigrating to Poland, from which his family fled two generations before. Mostly, though, he is haunted by the absence of his father, Elias, who abandoned him as a baby to go to Israel to fight in the 1973 war. The film, while busy and diffuse, is also touching and funny, and its modesty and haphazardness are among its charms. SCOTT\n*'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' Starring Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes and Lynn Collins. Directed by Michael Radford (R, 127 minutes). Shakespeare's most problematic play -- at least with respect to modern sensitivities -- receives an intelligent interpretation from Mr. Radford and a superb cast. Mr. Pacino, showing welcome restraint after a series of overdone stage and screen performances, emphasizes Shylock's grief and estrangement, turning him into a fragile monster. But his villainy, however much it smacks of blood libel, cannot be discarded without compromising the play's complex ideas about justice and duty, and Mr. Radford does not try to wash away the stain of anti-Semitism that is woven into the heart of his source. He does remind us how much more is going on in the play, and along with his talented production designer and cinematographer, he renders Venice as a series of Renaissance paintings -- tableaus that in evoking Vel\u00e1zquez, Rembrandt, Titian and Vermeer immerse us in the ferment of early modern Europe. Mr. Irons is quietly mesmerizing in the title role, a creature of mysterious melancholy whose soul seems at once pure and rotted. The movie really belongs to Ms. Collins, who gives Portia her rightful wit and charisma, and makes her the play's cruel and lovely moral center. SCOTT\n*'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' Starring Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Mr. Eastwood (PG-13, 135 minutes). Mr. Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. The picture's scale is small, and its pacing leisurely, which gives you a chance to savor three lovely performances: from Ms. Swank as the young boxer, Mr. Freeman as a world-weary former contender and Mr. Eastwood as the trainer, Frankie Dunn. At 74, Mr. Eastwood has achieved a level of mastery that leaves him with nothing to prove, and so, unafraid of sentiment and willing to risk clich\u00e9, he has made a graceful, lyrical, devastating masterpiece -- the best film released by a major Hollywood studio in 2004. SCOTT\n*'NOBODY KNOWS' Starring Yuya Yagira. . Directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda (PG-13, 141 minutes; in Japanese, with English subtitles). Based on the true story of four children abandoned by their mother in a small Tokyo apartment, Mr. Kore-eda's fourth film is at once harrowing and tender, an urban horror story with overtones of fairy tale. Restricting himself to the children's point of view, the director creates an almost unbearable sense of dread in the audience; you can't help suspecting that, at every moment, something terrible is about to happen. But at the same time, because the children themselves do not perceive the full terribleness of their situation, the terror is mitigated by a sense of wonder and adventure. The keys to this meticulous and deeply humane film are Mr. Kore-eda's deft camera sense and the remarkable performance of the 12-year-old Mr. Yagira as Akira, the oldest of the four siblings, who must somehow preserve his own innocence while protecting his more vulnerable brother and sisters. SCOTT\n'ONG BAK: THE THAI WARRIOR' Starring Tony Jaa. Directed by Prachya Pinkaew (R, 101 minutes; in Thai, with English subtitles). Martial arts for purists who disdain wirework, computer-generated imagery and digital tweaking. Ting (Mr. Jaa) a country bumpkin trained in the deadly art of Thai Muay, travels to Bangkok to retrieve the stolen head of his village Buddha. Once there, his peaceful disposition is challenged by all manner of thugs and lowlifes. The story is beside the point: like the low-budget Hong Kong action pictures of the 1970's, this movie offers scrappy, ingenious fight choreography. The director is so enamored of some sequences that he treats himself -- and the audience -- to instant replays. SCOTT\n'POOH'S HEFFALUMP MOVIE' With the voices of Jim Cummings, John Fiedler and Kyle Stanger. Directed by Frank Nissen. (G, 63 minutes). In A.A. Milne's Winnie the Pooh stories, Piglet once thought he had seen a heffalump, but it was really just Pooh with a honey jar stuck on his head. In this adorable animated film, he and the other animals finally encounter the real thing. And it (Lumpy the baby heffalump) is too cute for words, largely thanks to the endearing voice and infectious laugh of 8-year-old Kyle Stanger. The plot involves Roo capturing Lumpy (who thinks a visit to the Roo's part of Hundred Acre Wood sounds like a fine game) and Pooh, Tigger, Eeyore and company learning that Heffalumps aren't scary at all. There is a dash of child-pleasing animated slapstick, a few nice Carly Simon songs and a crucial lesson about the dangers of misjudging people just because they are different from you. GATES\n'A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT' Starring Audrey Tautou. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (R, 133 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). If you like battleground carnage delivered with aesthetic brio, the kind that ensures that when a soldier explodes into confetti, his flesh will dapple a trenchmate as decoratively as pink rosettes on a cake, this new French film will serve you nicely. Set during World War I and its immediate aftermath, and directed by the cult favorite Jean-Pierre Jeunet, it follows the adventures of a young woman, Mathilde (Ms. Tautou), who holds fast to the hope that her young soldier fianc\u00e9 will return home from his apparent grave. Even when death seems to part them, the cord of her love remains unbroken. Best known for \"Am\u00e9lie,\" a modern fairy tale also starring Ms. Tautou, Mr. Jeunet possesses a distinctive visual style that's part Rube Goldberg, part F.A.O. Schwarz, and generally enjoyable for about 15 minutes. DARGIS\n'THE WEDDING DATE' Starring Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney. Directed by Clare Kilner (PG-13, 90 minutes). Ms. Messing stars as Kat Ellis, a New Yorker en route to London for her younger half-sister's wedding. Since there is no man in Kat's life, she turns to the classified ads for male escorts. In a fantasy worthy of \"Pretty Woman,\" the male prostitute she hires turns out to be a hunk (Mr. Mulroney) with beautiful manners and a degree in comparative literature from Brown. Both stars are highly appealing, despite a shaky script. After rowdy parties in London, everyone heads for the glorious English countryside for family-bonding activities. \"The Wedding Date\" proves that there is nothing inherently magical about a group of adults frolicking on a lawn with an old pop-music hit in the background. What charms it does have would be far more enjoyable if the movie weren't so in love with its own supposed cuteness. GATES\n'THE WOODSMAN' Starring Kevin Bacon. Directed by Nicole Kassell (R, 87 minutes). Ms. Kassell directs this story of a paroled child molester struggling to re-enter society after 12 years in prison in a lean, unassuming style, which suits the subject matter and gives the fine cast room to explore their complicated, unhappy characters. The story is not always plausible, and the atmosphere sometimes feels programmatically grim, but the film is a serious, compassionate attempt at psychological realism, anchored by Mr. Bacon's precise, unsettling performance as a man trying to untangle his decent impulses from his destructive, predatory urges. SCOTT\nPop\nA selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.\nBABY MACARONI, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006. What's NRBQ without its two-fisted piano player, Terry Adams? It's Baby Macaroni, which features the other three members of the stalwart, rowdy, goodtimey band and assorted guests, and is likely to bring out their swinging rockabilly side. Tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $15 in advance, $17 tomorrow. JON PARELES\nBARBEZ, BAM Cafe, 30 Lafayette Avenue, Brooklyn, (718)636-4139. Barbez, a New York band, pushes sultry cabaret vocals and the violin and accordion of tango toward skewed extremes; its repertory includes songs by Weill and the Residents. Tomorrow night at 9; cover is free, with a $10 minimum. PARELES\n*DAVID BROMBERG, Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, Times Square, (212)840-2824 and Count Basie Theater, 99 Monmouth Street, Red Bank, N.J., (732)842-9000. David Bromberg can play just about anything with strings -- guitar, dobro, mandolin, fiddle -- and his knowledge of American music spans blues, bluegrass, country and rock. He also has a gift for elaborate verbal riffs that turn his long-suffering blues into comedy. In recent years, Mr. Bromberg has cut back on touring to become a builder and dealer of American-made violins, making this appearance a rare one. At Town Hall tonight at 8; tickets are $30 to $55. At Count Basie Theater tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $25 to $50. PARELES\nTHE CONCERT FOR DARFUR, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006. A benefit for Action Against Hunger, providing relief in the Darfur region of the Sudan, brings together pop-folk (Terre Roche of the Roches), blues-rock (Halley DeVestern, who sang with the revived Big Brother and the Holding Company), world music (Steve Gorn playing the Indian flute, the bansuri), gospel (the Broadway Inspirational Voices) and more. Sunday night at 6; tickets are $12 in advance, $15 Sunday. PARELES\n*DJ CAMEO, Supreme Trading, 213 North Eighth Street, near Roebling Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212)560-0951. This British D.J. is the host of what should be one of the best President's Day Weekend parties: a night devoted to the ferocious, London-based beats-and-rhymes genre known (among other things) as grime. DJ Cameo is the host of \"Pirate Sessions,\" the Sunday afternoon grime show on the digital radio station BBC 1Xtra. Expect to hear some of the tracks showcased on the excellent new grime compilation \"Run the Road\" (Vice), due out in America on March 8; the CD includes Dizzee Rascal and the Streets alongside emerging grime M.C.'s like Kano and Shystie. Sunday night at 11, with MC Deadly Crisis, DJ Dinesh and Greg Poole; free. KELEFA SANNEH\n*DJ HELL, Spirit, 530 West 27th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212)268-9477. This German D.J. and producer loves to push techno in two directions at once: he sees no reason that a severe, minimalist beat experiment needn't sit alongside an exuberant, maximalist new-wave rant. His new album (credited simply to Hell) is \"NY Muscle\" (International Deejay Gigolo), an unabashedly ridiculous but nevertheless engrossing CD full of hypnotic rhythm tracks and over-the-top vocals -- robots trying to sound like divas and vice versa. Sunday night after 11 (and long into Monday morning -- DJ Hell isn't scheduled to play until 3:15), with Savas Pascalidis, Mount Sims DJ Unknown, Terry Francis, Eddie Richards and more; tickets are $20 in advance, $25 at the door. SANNEH\n*FELIX DA HOUSECAT, Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)804-8708. His new-wavey 2004 album, \"Devin Dazzle & the Neon Fever\" (Emperor Norton), was something of a disappointment: his continuing obsession with the sights and sounds of 1980's nightlife is starting to seem like a joke in search of a punchline. Still, he remains one of the country's most reliably entertaining D.J.'s, and at this party you can expect the usual: a casual set full of robotic dance tracks and vocal-driven originals. Tomorrow night after 10; admission is $25 before midnight, $30 thereafter. SANNEH\nTHE FUNK BROTHERS, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144. One of Motown Records' secrets was the studio band that backed the Supremes, Marvin Gaye, the Temptations, the Four Tops and virtually everyone else on the label in its 1960's heyday. After getting belated recognition with the documentary \"Standing in the Shadows of Motown,\" the surviving members have stayed together to tour with guest singers, still knocking out those indelible beats and hooks. Tonight at 8 and 10:30; tickets are $45. PARELES\n*JIMMIE DALE GILMORE, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8778 or (212)239-6200. Jimmie Dale Gilmore was a member of the primordial West Texas songwriters' alliance, the Flatlanders, before embarking on a solo career of songs filled with tenderness and down-home mysticism. Sunday night at 9:30; tickets are $25 in advance, $30 at the door PARELES\nSANDRA LUNA, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, (212)576-1155. The Argentine singer Sandra Luna is devoted to the imperious tragedy of the tango in all its generations: from old romantic songs in classic style, to Astor Piazzolla's modernist tango nuevo, to new songs infused with jazz. Her album \"Tango Var\u00f3n\" (Times Square) was nominated for a Grammy Award. Sunday night at 7; tickets are $20 in advance, $23 Sunday. PARELES\nILYAS MALAYEV ENSEMBLE/ROSHEL AMIN, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212)864-5400 or (212)545-7536. The Bukharan Jews of Central Asia soaked up music from Persia, Turkey and the Arabic world in the improvisatory pieces called shashmaqam, mastering poetic and musical traditions with Islamic roots. Ilyas Malayev, who performed for stadium-size audiences in Uzbekistan before immigrating to the United States in 1994, plays the tar, the Central Asian lute, and is renowned for his deep knowledge of traditions dating back to the 15th century. Roshel Amin is part of musical dynasty, playing the tanbur, another kind of lute, in the style of his father, the renowned Bukharan musician Neryo Aminov. Tonight at 8; tickets are $26, or $22 for World Music Institute and Symphony Space members, $15 for students. PARELES\n*BUDDY MILLER, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111. Last year Buddy Miller, the guitarist and singer who has long been a mainstay of Emmylou Harris's band, released \"Universal United House of Prayer\" (New West), a highly personal album of country gospel songs. Singing about devastation and divine mercy, he could sound ornery and awestruck at the same time. Tonight at 8, with Ollabelle opening; tickets are $20. PARELES\nRHETT MILLER, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212)533-2680. As the singer and songwriter with the Old 97's, Rhett Miller turns his travails into twangy, reckless songs. When he plays the songs alone, as he does here, their pain moves closer to the surface, though the resilience remains. Tonight at 7 and 9:30; admission is $18. PARELES\nYOKO ONO AND SEAN LENNON, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503. Tonic, the independent-minded haven for improvisation and avant-rock, is trying to stave off closing with a series of benefit concerts. Yoko Ono, who celebrates her 72nd birthday with this concert, has written benevolent pop-rock songs and hooked up with dance producers for remixes, and when John Lennon was alive she let loose vocals on songs like \"Don't Worry, Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)\" that startled or inspired singers on the fringe. She's joined by her son, Sean Lennon, who has worked with downtown, genre-splicing New York bands like Cibo Matto and made his own album as well as backing his mother. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $50. PARELES\nMARIANNE PILLSBURY, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700. On her debut album, \"The Wrong Marianne\" (www.mariannepillsbury.com), Marianne Pillsbury is as frank as Liz Phair and as tuneful and upbeat as the Go-Go's, dissecting romantic disasters and then bouncing back with light-hearted choruses. Sunday night at 8, with Paranoid Social Club at 10, Johnny 5 at 9 and Cuaxbei at 7; admission is $8. PARELES\n*LUCIA PULIDO, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8778 or (212)239-6200. Lucia Pulido, a singer from Colombia, has recorded versions of traditional songs that surround her gutsy voice with arrangements for a modern jazz rhythm section and horns and had new ones written for her by Sebastian Cruz, who will be performing with her at this concert. As Susana Baca has done with Afro-Peruvian songs, Ms. Pulido holds on to the rawness of the original melodies while giving them a sophisticated new context. Tonight at 9:30; admission is $15. PARELES\nTHE RADIATORS, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703. The second-line backbeat of New Orleans funk is the heartbeat of the Radiators, a rock band that has been together since the 1970's. As band members sing about woman trouble and other frustrations, the groove keeps people shimmying. Tomorrow night at 9 and Sunday night at 7; admission is $25. PARELES\nROBBERS ON HIGH STREET, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. There's a lot of the Beatles, especially their piano-pumping side, in the songs of Robbers on High Street, updated with Elvis Costello's gruffness and a matter-of-fact desperation. Tonight at 9:30, with the Upwelling at 11:30, Bishop Allen at 10:30, the Head Set at 8:30 and God or Julie at 7:30. Admission is $10. PARELES\n*SOUND TRIBE SECTOR NINE, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place at 15th Street, Union Square, (212)777-6800. Jam-band fans come to dance; dance-music fans strive for communal utopia. It was inevitable that they would meet, and in the instrumental jam band Sound Tribe Sector Nine they do, as the live musicians embrace the rhythms of drum-and-bass, house and other current dance music. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, with Genetic opening; tickets are $22 PARELES\n*RICHIE SPICE, Elite Ark, 900 Sheffield Avenue, at Wortman Avenue, Canarsie, Brooklyn, (718)649-6535. This fiery roots-reggae singer released one of 2004's best reggae albums, \"Spice in Your Life\" (www.fifthelementrecords.com). He loves midtempo reggae grooves, but he's a restless singer, by turns sweet and swaggering and sometimes both at once. The album includes his biggest hit, \"Earth a Run Red,\" an exhilarating protest song where Spice decries the hard-knock life ( \"'Watch out fi de vampire who will sneak up in the dark/Watch out fi de big-time thief who claim say that dem smart/Stop bringing the crack and the gun, come mash up the youth dem heart\") before arriving at a refrain that makes the apocalypse sound like the world's best party. Sunday night after 10, with Chuck Fenda, Anthony Cruz and Jamesy P; the price of admission is $30 in advance, more at the door . SANNEH\nTAMMY FAYE STARLITE AND THE ANGELS, Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue at 27th Street, (212)683-6500. God and country (music) get some raunchy, funny twists in the songs of Tammy Faye Starlite, who keeps mining the comic possibilities of country-singing evangelism. Lately, she has been singing some Loretta Lynn songs, too. Tonight's first set begins at 10; free. PARELES\nTHE STRAWBS ACOUSTIC TRIO, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, (212)576-1155. The Strawbs, led by David Cousins, were part of the British trad-rock movement of the late 1960's and 1970's, reaching back to modal Celtic melodies and the lore of ancient ballads. This version of the band is unplugged, with Mr. Cousins, Dave Lambert and Brian Willoughby. Tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $25 in advance, $30 tomorrow. PARELES\nCabaret\nA selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.\nRUTH BROWN, Le Jazz au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, (212)308-9455. This rhythm-and-blues legend has weathered one personal disaster after another, but misfortunes that might have silenced a less determined performer have only added dimension to Ms. Brown's already larger-than-life musical personality. Exhibiting a flamboyant showmanship that recalls her peer James Brown, she proudly presents herself as an indomitable member of royalty and stylistic descendant of the Queen of the Blues herself, Dinah Washington. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and 9:30, and Sunday night at 8. Cover: $50 tonight and tomorrow; $35 on Sunday; no minimum. STEPHEN HOLDEN\n*BLOSSOM DEARIE, Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)265-8133. To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. She remains the definitive interpreter, at once fey and tough, of the pop-jazz satirist Dave Frishberg, as astute and unforgiving a social critic as exists. The songs -- her own and other people's -- date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit, which have never gone stale. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available. HOLDEN\n*BRIAN STOKES MITCHELL, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212)339-4095. With his heroic baritone and dashing stage presence, Brian Stokes Mitchell has been called Broadway's last leading man in the tradition of Alfred Drake and John Raitt. His performances in the revivals of \"Kiss Me Kate\" and \"Man of La Mancha,\" and in City Center's Encores series (\"Do Re Mi\"), as well as assorted Gershwin tributes, have lent the swashbuckling archetype a modern slant. Glinting through all the heavy lifting are an innate ebullience, a sense of humor and a strain of tenderness. In \"Love/Life,\" his cabaret debut at Feinstein's, traditional Broadway chest-beating is kept to a minimum, except in a commanding version of \"The Impossible Dream\" at the end of the show that rolls through the club like a clap of thunder echoing in the mountains. (Tonight and tomorrow, final performances, at 8:30 and 11, Cover: $60; $40 minimum at the early shows, $30 at the late shows.) HOLDEN\nUTE LEMPER, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212)570-7189. This imperious, Dietrichesque cabaret singer, who is performing with a pop quartet through next weekend, lends the entire nightclub enterprise a German Expressionist seriousness. If her latest show is entirely different from the program of original songs she performed last year at Le Jazz au Bar, its attitude is similar. Most of the material doesn't deal directly with politics, history and literature, like the sprawling topical broadsides of the earlier show. But she still invests it with a ferocity that infuses the art (and artifice) of cabaret with an unrelenting dramatic intensity. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $65; $40 at the bar; no minimum.

Allen, a young tenor saxophonist who has played with Betty Carter, Cindy Blackman, Orrin Evans and others, is doing his part in Butch Morris's monthlong \"Black February\" series of nightly performances. He's playing in most of the large improvising ensembles conducted by Mr. Morris through the month, and he's also playing this weekly gig with his own trio, including Ameen Saleem on bass and Jeremy Clemons on drums. On the music stand will be Mr. Morris's own compositions going back to the 1970's, which graced a number of old David Murray albums. They're powerfully appealing melodies; it's been too long since they've been heard. Tomorrow night at 8 pm; free. BEN RATLIFF\nIGOR BUTMAN ORCHESTRA, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, midtown, (212) 581-3080. The saxophonist Igor Butman occupies a position in Russia roughly comparable to that of Wynton Marsalis here: besides the fact that the two musicians were both born in 1961, he's an adaptable, highly skilled practitioner and jazz's most appealing popularizer there. His brawny post-bop improvisations are crowd-pleasers, and he'll play with his big band, seldom heard over here. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30; minimum, $10. RATLIFF\n*BILL CHARLAP TRIO, Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 721-6500. For about eight years running, Mr. Charlap has had a steady trio with the bassist Peter Washington and the drummer Kenny Washington; his performances have become extraordinary displays of discipline and improvisation -- the wonders of an organized, creative mind. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $10 to $150. RATLIFF\nJOHN HICKS TRIO, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue South, Manhattan, (212) 885-7125. Notes bunch up in John Hicks's piano chords. They're always filling his fists, and he keeps a few fingers agitatedly moving around within the chords, keeping a bebop pulsation constant through the wall of sound. He wears time loosely, letting himself fall behind the beat; his ideas scramble around to become realized, and he makes thick, heavyweight brocades of post-Coltrane jazz. Sets are tonight at 9 and 10:45; cover charge is $15. RATLIFF\nJAVON JACKSON QUARTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212)864-6662. A member of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers in their later days, the saxophonist Javon Jackson has made a number of records in the last decade that experiment with repertory, going outside all the usual jazz songbooks. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $25. RATLIFF\n*JORGE BEN JOR, SOB's, 204 Varick Street, South Village, (212)243-4940. When the great Brazilian singer-songwriter Jorge Ben Jor slipped into disco rhythms in the late 70's and 80's, it fit him perfectly, and he's still there. He breaks up his chugging electric-guitar rhythms into sharp, syncopated patterns close to those of Nile Rodgers of Chic, and his percussionists play samba-school rhythms around the central driving pulse. Live, he keeps the party going, fusing tunes or scratching out a new rhythm-guitar line as soon as the last song has stopped. He'll likely play new music from a new album, \"Reactivus Amor Est\" (Universal Brasil), his best work in ages. Tomorrow at 9 and midnight; cover charge is $30 in advance, more at the door. RATLIFF\nJANE MONHEIT, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212)475-8592. Ms. Monheit is one of the most popular new jazz singers, and though her choice of material sometimes dips into schmaltz, she wields great control over her petite voice and a way of injecting contemporary speech rhythms into her sung lines that are true, honest and contemporary. Sets through Sunday night at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $35; minimum, $5. RATLIFF\n*BUTCH MORRIS, Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, between Metropolitan Avenue and North Third Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)218-6934; www.zebuloncafeconcert.com; Belt Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)563-0487; Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, East Village, (212)614-0505. Butch Morris has set up performances every night during February; he's calling it \"Black February,\" and this month officially celebrates 20 years of Mr. Morris's \"conductions,\" performances in which he conducts groups of improvisers, jazz or otherwise, with his own language of signals and baton movements. It's fun to watch, and he has a strong sense of humor and beauty. He's playing with different ensembles each night, and here's the weekend schedule: with Butchlandband at Zebulon, tonight at 10 and midnight; free; with the Butch Morris Emyoueseyesee Ensemble tomorrow at 4 p.m. at the Belt Theater; admission is $10; with the New York Skyscraper Ensemble Sunday at 5 and 6 p.m., at Bowery Poetry Club; admission is $12. Check his Web site, www.conduction.us, for further information on these and other performances. RATLIFF\n*DAFNIS PRIETO QUINTET, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. Dafnis Prieto, the young Cuban jazz drummer, arrived in the United States about five years ago and was quickly hired by all kinds of bands. The essence of his style is his collation of various Afro-Cuban percussion sounds -- from old religious music to modern -- within one set of trap drums. His playing is infernally complicated, and infernally precise; the blizzard of accents he throws into any pattern have their place as surely as pixels in a computer image. He is also a gifted composer. In his own work, rearranged danzons jostle against experiments in meter and harmony; his music switches between smoothly cushioned rhythms and spiky ones. Tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set. RATLIFF\nROSWELL RUDD AND MALICOOL, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway at 95th Street, Upper West Side, (212)864-5400. The trombonist Roswell Rudd has a gregarious, rabble-rousing sound; but he did his homework a long time ago, looking for ways to unite all kinds of music, especially New Orleans and bop and free. Recently he collaborated with musicians from Mali, including the notable kora player Toumani Diabate, on the album \"Malicool\" (Sunnyside); here he presents a New York version of the music with New York's resident kora master, Mamadou Diabate. Tonight at 8 p.m.; tickets are $26; members, $22; students, $15. RATLIFF\nCAROL SLOANE AND THE NORMAN SIMMONS QUINTET, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 258-9595. Carol Sloane is a veteran jazz singer and a shrewd one, with restraint and serenity among her virtues; the pianist Norman Simmons is a master accompanist to people like her. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge, $30; minimums, $10 at the tables, $5 at the bar. RATLIFF\n*CECIL TAYLOR BIG BAND, Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, midtown, (212)582-2121. Cecil Taylor, at 75 seemingly as vigorous as ever, has built the art of his pianism on technique and stamina in equal measure; his music avoids the narrative of song in favor of a vatic musical free verse full of clustered chords and flashing figures. (It is notated, though: you'll see a lot of sheet music.) Above all he is a great pianist, and you hear that intermittently in the dense swirl of his 16-piece big band. These affairs over the last decade or so have been wild, boisterous nights. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $32.50; minimum, $10. RATLIFF\nCHARLES TOLLIVER BIG BAND, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232. The trumpeter Charles Tolliver left behind a worthwhile trail of music in the 1970's, writing and playing post-bop with a new complexity, recording on the independent label Strata-East. Over the last few years he has become a presence in the New York clubs again. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25, $20 on Sunday. RATLIFF\n*VILLAGE VANGUARD 70th ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037. The best jazz club in New York is throwing itself a party this week, to celebrate 70 years in business, by booking some of the best and most-loved groups in jazz, all of whom claim the club as their regular New York venue. Check out the top-shelf weekend lineup: Tonight, the guitarist Jim Hall's duo; tomorrow, the Heath Brothers, with brothers Jimmy, Percy and Tootie Heath; Sunday night, the pianist Bill Charlap's trio. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11 p.m., with an 12:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25; minimum, $10. RATLIFF\nClassical\nA selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.\nOpera\n'ARIANNA IN CRETA' A seldom-performed opera from Handel's prime becomes sung drama at the Gotham Chamber Opera, thanks to the director Christopher Alden, but the lasting impression is of talented young singers flinging themselves headlong into their music, throwing caution (and concern about sounding pretty) to the winds. Katherine Rohrer spews out notes like water from a fire hydrant as Teseo (Theseus), the teenage Greek general; Caroline Worra, as Arianna (Ariadne), gets to use her free, slightly metallic voice in a diva turn; Hanan Alattar and Jennifer Hines bend genders as a soprano boy and a contralto girl; and Neal Goren conducts an energetic, throaty reading in the pit. Tonight at 7:30, Henry Street Settlement, 466 Grand Street, Lower East Side, (212)279-4200. Tickets: $30 to $60. ANNE MIDGETTE\nBEIJING OPERA COMPANY OF HUBEI PROVINCE It seemed a few years ago, largely on the strength of the epochal presentation of \"The Peony Pavilion\" by the Lincoln Center Festival, that Chinese Opera was gathering momentum in New York. But the boomlet has receded, so this appearance by a native company in classic fare, \"Monkey King Attacks White Bone Demon,\" is especially welcome. May the Year of the Rooster bring more. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Sold out. JAMES R. OESTREICH\n'LA BOH\u00c8ME' It's been some time since the Metropolitan Opera's crowd-pleasing production of Puccini's \"Boh\u00e8me\" has held much interest for adventurous opera buffs. But this season's revival offers an impressive and intriguing cast. The golden-voiced coloratura soprano Ruth Ann Swenson continues her exploration of the rich lyric soprano repertory as she sings the role of Mimi, with the hardy tenor Roberto Aronica as Rodolfo. The vibrant soprano Patricia Racette sings Musetta, with the robust baritone Dwayne Croft as her off-again, on-again boyfriend Marcello. Daniel Oren conducts. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Sold out, but returns may be be available at the box office. ANTHONY TOMMASINI\n*'LE NOZZE DI FIGARO' Jonathan Miller's 1998 production, now directed by Robin Guarino, has the virtue of letting Mozart's music and Da Ponte's libretto work their magic unhindered. But that can't happen if the casting and chemistry aren't right. The Met has assembled a youthful cast that has everything -- good looks, vocal and dramatic agility and the energy and alertness necessary to bring to life this score's vivid ensembles. The principals are John Releya as Figaro; Andrea Rost as Susanna; Jossie P\u00e9rez as Cherubino; Mariusz Kwiecien as the Count and Janice Watson as the Countess. James Levine conducts. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Sold out, but returns may be available at the box office. ALLAN KOZINN\n'NABUCCO' The Metropolitan Opera's revival of Verdi's \"Nabucco\" this year promises a few bigger guns than last year's production. James Levine will conduct. Maria Guleghina sings Abigaille, and Nikolai Putilin takes the title role. Patriotism is in the air, and for many, patriotism is what \"Nabucco\" is all about. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Remaining tickets: $145 and $215. BERNARD HOLLAND\nClassical\nBARGEMUSIC Moored in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, this intimate floating concert hall is a charming place to hear solo recitals and chamber music while rocking gently on the waves of the East River. Tonight brings works by Falla, Debussy and Dvorak performed by Jan Vogler (cello), Mira Wang (violin) and Simone Dinnerstein (piano). Tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon, Isidore Cohen, the former violinist of the Beaux-Arts Trio, will be joined by Aaron Boyd (violin), Maurycy Banaszek (viola) and Priscilla E. Lee (cello) for Haydn's string quartet arrangement of his own magnificent \"Seven Last Words of Christ.\" Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718)624-2083. Tickets: $35; students, $25. JEREMY EICHLER\nRICHARD GOODE This distinguished American pianist seems to have emerged whole from a period of injury and frustration and continues his progress with a recital at Carnegie Hall. The program reflects Mr. Goode's serious and reflective music mind: the Bach E-minor Partita, Schoenberg's Six Little Piano Pieces, the Beethoven Sonata, Op. 109, and, most interesting from a musician known for his concentration on German music, the first book of Debussy's Preludes. Sunday night at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $23 to $87. HOLLAND\nMANHATTAN SCHOOL OF MUSIC PHILHARMONIA It has been a big week for student orchestras in New York. With ensembles from the Juilliard School and Mannes College already having displayed their wares, the Manhattan School completes the hat trick. Jeffrey Milarsky, a conductor who has made a name for himself in new-music circles, reverts here to the first half of the 20th century, leading Copland's \"Appalachian Spring\" Suite, Nielsen's Clarinet Concerto (with Mariko Sudo as soloist) and \"La Mer,\" by Debussy. Tonight at 8, Manhattan School of Music, Broadway at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (917)493-4428. Free. OESTREICH\nMETROPOLITAN MUSEUM ARTISTS IN CONCERT Tonight the Metropolitan Museum of Art's resident chamber ensemble of excellent musicians, either young in fact or young in spirit, presents the second of three concerts this season at the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, a wonderfully intimate hale for chamber music. Picking up with a series focus on recent music from Eastern Europe and Russia, the ensemble offers Arvo P\u00e4rt's Adagio for Piano Trio and Alfred Schnittke's Piano Quintet. There are also works by Schubert and Mendelssohn. The cellist Edward Arron, the artistic director of the series, is joined by Jennifer Frautschi and Laura Frautschi (violins), Colin Jacobsen (violin and viola), Nicholas Cords (viola) and Andrew Armstrong (piano). Tonight at 7, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)570-3949. Tickets: $20. TOMMASINI\nNANCARROW FESTIVAL The music of Conlon Nancarrow has been getting a varied if not thorough exploration this season at the Miller Theater, where a four-part festival began in October. The final installment, performed by the energetic new-music ensemble, Alarm Will Sound, includes the American premiere of the composer's \"Three Movements,\" as well as the Piece for Small Orchestra No. 1 and a handful of the Player Piano Studies. Also on the program is Gyorgy Ligeti's Piano Concerto and two Studies for piano (one in both a standard piano and a player piano version), as well as works by Charles Ives and Jelly Roll Morton. Tomorrow night at 8, at Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799. Tickets: $20, $12 for students. KOZINN\nPEOPLES' SYMPHONY CONCERTS This venerable organization presents top-tier artists and ensembles at remarkably affordable prices. This weekend is a case in point with two prominent chamber ensembles on the schedule, each performing for about the price of a movie ticket. Tomorrow Musicians from Marlboro, a group culled from ranks of the prestigious summer festival, juxtaposes two Mozart string quintets (K. 174 and K. 516) with Hindemith's \"Melancholie.\" And on Sunday the Tokyo String Quartet offers a program of repertory staples it should pull off well: Beethoven's Quartet Op. 18, No. 6, Mendelssohn's early Quartet Op. 12 and Ravel's Quartet. Tomorrow night at 8, Washington Irving High School, 40 Irving Place, at 16th Street; Sunday at 2 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)586-4680. Tickets: $9 tomorrow; $9 to $18 on Sunday, with limited availability. EICHLER\nANDR\u00c9 WATTS This pianist is playing a three-concert series at the Metropolitan Museum this season. In the first, in November, he performed in a chamber ensemble; for the third, in April, he plans to give an illustrated talk on a Beethoven Sonata. But the most promising of the three is the solo program he is performing tomorrow -- a concert similar to one he gave at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in November. On the program are Haydn's Sonata No. 58 in C , Mozart's Rondo in D (K. 485), Schubert's \"Klavierst\u00fccke\" (D. 946), Debussy's \"Estampes,\" a group of Liszt works, and selections from \"Musica Ricercata,\" a 1951 suite by the great contemporary Hungarian composer Gyorgy Ligeti. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)570-3949. Tickets: $35.

Her work will be shown in a free exhibition through Feb. 28. Gallery hours 2 to 8 p.m. daily. Furman Gallery, Walter Reade Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)875-5600. JENNIFER DUNNING\nAKIM FUNK BUDDHA The ever-exuberant Mr. Buddha specializes in dance-theater that combines unblinking stillness, storytelling, tap and Mongolian throat-singing. He adds martial arts, breakdancing, beat-boxing and Japanese, Zulu and urban English talk to the mix in his new \"Amazulu: Dance as a Weapon: The Hip-Hop Circus -- Part I.\" Tonight and tomorrow at 10 p.m.; Sunday at 5:30 p.m., La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)475-7710 or www.lamamaorg.

JACK ANDERSON\n*NEW YORK CITY BALLET Susan Stroman's hit \"Double Feature\" returns to the City Ballet repertory this weekend at all performances. You could quibble that the first act, a would-be ballet called \"The Blue Necklace,\" reveals the perils of crossover choreography. The second act, \"Makin' Whoopee!\" is pure silly pleasure, a silent-movie style comedy that at one point sends what appear to be thousands of brides and a scene-stealing dog speeding across the stage. Don't ask. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570 or www.nycballet.com. Tickets: $30 to $83.

DUNNING\n*CATHY WEIS PROJECTS Ms. Weis's nutty imagination and humor combine, in her dance and video pieces, to create art that has been described as rough-edged magic.

What's wrong with this picture? The Museum of Modern Art, the most visionary museum of the 20th century, is inaugurating the temporary-exhibition galleries in its 21st-century home with an exhibition of gifts from a corporate collection. It is an ambitious, carefully selected corporate collection, but that doesn't keep the ensemble from feeling corporate, monotonous and by the book. The 40 (of 64) works given or promised to the Modern are nearly all by white male artists, and they are all already represented in the collection. There's nothing wrong with the individual works by artists like Philip Guston, Jasper Johns and Vija Celmins that won't be cured by integrating them into the Modern's collection, but the ensemble effect is dispiriting. With an emphasis on a narrow swath of the 1980's mainstream, the show feels like an excessively edited letter in a bottle from an art world that no longer exists. Hours: Saturdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; closed Tuesdays. Admission: $20; $16 for 65+; $12 for students; children under 16 and accompanied by an adult, free. Free on Fridays from 4 to 8 p.m. ROBERTA SMITH\n'RUTH DUCKWORTH, MODERNIST SCULPTOR,' Museum of Arts and Design, 40 West 53rd Street, (212)956-3535, through April 3. A sculptor whose basic medium is clay, Ms. Duckworth makes everything from tiny, delicate vessels to monumental outdoor sculptures. Though her work fits in -- but not too neatly -- with the modernist tradition, her eye has roamed everywhere, resulting in a bewildering variety of styles and influences, from Brancusi to a beef bone found in her soup. Sometimes the influences combine awkwardly, making her work seem a little strained and quirky, but often enough her venturesomeness pays off, producing images of eloquence and power. Hours: Daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Thursdays: 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $9; $6 for 65+ and students. Thursdays from 6 to 8 p.m. is pay what you wish. GRACE GLUECK\n*'FROM FILIPPO LIPPI TO PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA: FRA CARNEVALE AND THE MAKING OF A RENAISSANCE MASTER,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through May 1. The Italian Renaissance artist-priest known as Fra Carnevale was an art-world somebody in his day but a shadowy figure to modern historians, known primarily for two extraordinary paintings of tiny figures in fantastic architectural settings. Both paintings are in this intricate think-piece of a show that tries to reconstruct his career by bringing his known paintings together. At the same time, it uses his work, along with that of major figures like Filippo Lippi and Piero della Francesca, to explore larger ideas about self-created professional identity in a cultural epoch far more diverse than it is sometimes thought to have been. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $15; 65+, $10; students, $7. HOLLAND COTTER\n'I WANNA BE LOVED BY YOU: PHOTOGRAPHS OF MARILYN MONROE,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718)638-5000, through March 20. Monroe was one of the great movie stars of the 20th century, but does that make her a good subject for a museum show? Fans might enjoy the almost 200 photographs from a private collection presented in this exhibition, but though many are by famous photographers, including Richard Avedon, Cecil Beaton and Henri Cartier-Bresson, the show as a whole is like a walk-in special issue of People magazine: diverting but superficial and enervating. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4. KEN JOHNSON\n'IMAGES OF DON QUIXOTE: THE ART OF ILLUSTRATION AND PRINTMAKING,' the Hispanic Society of America, 613 West 155th Street, Washington Heights, (212)926-2234, through March 5. A few years back, a poll of international writers voted \"Don Quixote\" the greatest book of all time. This year Cervantes's novel is four centuries old, and the Hispanic Society of America is celebrating the occasion with this exhibition of illustrations of the story printed from the 17th through 20th centuries. Despite its small size, the show demonstrates how attitudes toward the book changed in different eras, from raucous comedy to Romantic tragedy. And in designs by artists like John Vanderbank, Fragonard and Gustave Dor\u00e9, there are fascinating images and ideas to consider. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 4 p.m. Free. COTTER\nGalleries: 57th Street\nROBERT GOODNOUGH, Katharina Rich Perlow, 41 East 57th Street, (212)644-7171, through March 3. Mr. Goodnough hobnobbed with De Kooning, Pollock and other New York avant-gardists in the 1940's and 50's, but his signature compositions of clustered triangles and trapezoids are more a rejuvenation of late Cubism than a variant of Abstract Expressionism. This show of medium-size pictures dating from 1972 to 2004 demonstrates the range of moods -- from meditative to agitated -- that he has coaxed out of his restricted vocabulary. JOHNSON\n'LEON POLK SMITH: FORMS AND FUNCTIONS,' Joan T. Washburn, 20 West 57th Street, (212)397-6780, through March 5. Spaces and their boundaries fascinated this hard-edge abstractionist (1906-1996) and in this show of his biomorphic paintings from the 1950's his elegantly calculated contrivance of one space impinging on another pleasingly asks the eye to tease out figure-ground relationships. In \"Over Easy,\" a large, partly heart-shaped figure of mauve thrusts on to a black ground at an angle; or is it the curvy black space that cuts into the aggressor? Smith's clean, flat surfaces, each restricted to two colors, are shown with examples of sleek, minimal contoured furniture by front-line designers of the period, Charles and Ray Eames and Isamu Noguchi among them. The biomorphic shapes of the furniture and their colors play nicely off Smith's smart, snappy formats. GLUECK\n'VIEW EIGHT: A FEW DOMESTIC OBJECTS INTERROGATE A FEW WORKS OF ART,' Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212)752-2929, through Feb. 26. This canny show of artworks and objects of design includes Josiah McElheny's curvy mirrored coffee table bearing mirrored blobby objects; beautiful blobby ceramic sculptures by Ken Price; delicate, biomorphic hanging lights by Lionel Theodore Dean; a twisted, retro-futuristic orange bench by Sachio Hihara; and, like the nightmare that domestic utopianism tries to insulate us from, one of Lee Bontecou's early, scarily militaristic reliefs. JOHNSON\nGalleries: SoHo\nRALPH GOINGS, Louis K. Meisel, 141 Prince Street, (212)677-1340, through Feb. 26. A must for fans of Photorealism, vintage trucks and classic diners, this show presents three signature works by one of the best of the original Photorealist painters: old pickup trucks in parking lots copied from photographs with Vermeerish tenderness in 1970 and 71. Four lovingly rendered views of diner interiors and industrial coffee-making machines from the early 90's round out the exhibition. JOHNSON\n'WHO IS THE PROTAGONIST?' Guild & Greyshkul, 28 Wooster Street, (212)625-9224, through Feb. 26. This engaging exhibition about approaches to storytelling includes a life-size space station interior handmade by Lisi Raskin; a Modernist theater environment with a mysterious sci-fi video called \"Moon Colony\" by Ohad Meromi, the show's organizer; a short, strange sci-fi story written by Halsey Rodman; a storyboard for a film about a father and his young son by Guy Ben-Ner; and a Pop-Cubist head of cut and painted paper by Ryan Johnson. JOHNSON\nGalleries: Chelsea\nGUY BEN-NER: 'WILD BOY,' Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, (212)727-3323, through Feb. 26. Two short films by Israel's representative to the 2005 Venice Biennale charmingly spoof quasi-scientific documentary film-making. Made entirely at home, \"Wild Boy\" is about a feral child (played by the artist's young son) who is captured, cleaned-up and trained by a researcher played by Mr. Ben-Ner. Another film that follows the fortunes of a family of ostriches played by the artist and his family in ridiculous costumes has a perfect anthropomorphising voice-over. JOHNSON\nT.J. WILCOX: 'GARLANDS,' Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)206-7100, through Feb. 26. The 21 short and very short films in this beautiful show, looped in \"garlands\" on six continuously running projectors are triggered by personal memories, family photographs, a news photo, the name of a Japanese doll. Each is as deft as a quick sketch or bit of haiku, a compressed, elegiac meditation on the fragile, ephemeral nature of life as reflected in the gossamer nature of the moving image itself. SMITH\nCECILY BROWN, Gagosian, 555 West 24th Street, (212)741-1111, through Feb. 26. Because it was a blend of Abstract Expressionist style and pornographic imagery that first drew the limelight to Ms. Brown, sensational things are expected of her. She disappoints by being merely good, as she is in her new work. With their all-over fields of splintery and squiggly gestures in nicely coordinated colors, her paintings based on landscape motifs are visually engaging, but they want some more adventurous approaches to form and imagery. JOHNSON\nSARAH ANNE JOHNSON: 'TREE PLANTING,' Julie Saul Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)627-2410, through March 12. This unusually impressive solo debut recounts the coming-of-age ritual of Canada's tree-planting summer camps through an unusually affecting mixture of real-life photographs and set-up photographs. Some images show actual young vigorous people on the brink of adulthood working and playing hard. In others, stocky little dolls, made by the artist, revel in equally fake woodland settings, revealing the childlike innocence their real counterparts are trying to outgrow. SMITH\nKNUT ASDAM: 'FILTER CITY,' Gasser & Grunert, 524 West 19th Street, (212)807-9494, through Feb. 19. This Norwegian artist who has exhibited extensively in Europe presents a slow, enigmatic, 21-minute film about two young women -- one small and white, the other tall and black -- who, between long pauses, emit oracular, world-weary utterances about social issues and obscure personal concerns. It is well produced and nice to watch, though it borders inadvertently on a parody of pretentious avant-garde filmmaking. JOHNSON\nSANTE D'ORAZIO: 'PAM: AMERICAN ICON,' Stellan Holm, 524 West 24th Street, (212) 627-7444, through March 5. Pamela Anderson -- yes, that Pamela Anderson -- in all her pneumatic, mostly unclothed glory is the subject of large and surrealistically vivid photographs that were originally commissioned but not published by Playboy magazine. Students: discuss criteria for judging the value -- aesthetic and otherwise -- of these artworks. JOHNSON\nJOHN LURIE, Roebling Hall, 606 West 26th Street, (212)929-8180, through Feb. 26. The stream-of-consciousness notational ink drawings and radiant gouaches of the musician John Lurie have precedents in the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat and William Wegman's early Conceptual drawings and maybe the cartoons of Roz Chast, but they have their own sense of wiry line and texture, wordplay, sexual bluntness and radiant color. SMITH\n'WORK ON PAPER,' Nicole Klagsbrun, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 243-3335, through Feb. 26. Highlights of this lively exhibition of things made on or of paper by more than 20 artists include a huge woodblock print by Mel Kendrick; Magic Realist ball point drawings of odd wooden structures by Billy Malone; John Pilson's video sequence of different hands drawing pigs; and Juliana Ellman's funny small painting of inflatable furniture going over a waterfall. JOHNSON\n'RUGS FROM AFGHANISTAN,' Esso Gallery and Books, 531 West 26th Street, (212)560-9728, through March 5. So-called traditional art is a constantly updated mirror of current events, and this is certainly true of weaving in Afghanistan. Working on commission in the 1970's, Afghan women embroidered designs by the Italian conceptual artist Alghiero Boetti (1940-1994) of world maps reflecting shifts in the balance of power among nation-states. While this project was in progress, Afghanistan itself was traumatized by a Soviet invasion that inspired the invention of a genre of \"war carpets,\" incorporating images of guns, tanks and war-planes. The fascinating show at Esso includes both types, as well as imaginative hybrids of the two, in a cross-cultural merging of media, styles and ideas that is a model for the way history works. COTTER\nOther Galleries\nMATTHEW ANTEZZO, Maccarone, 45 Canal Street, (212)431-4977, through March 13. Among works by the artist known for deadpan copies of art magazine ads are nondescript penciled copies of photographs of feminist heroines like Bella Abzug and Gloria Steinem; copies in pencil of news photographs of American Indian protest events that took place in 1975; and a painting of an ancient statue of Diogenes of Sinope titled \"Cynic.\" What it all means could keep an undergraduate seminar busy for some time. JOHNSON\nLast Chance\n'ALMOST,' Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, Chelsea(212) 366-4774, closing tomorrow. Including works by James Casebere, Neo Rauch, Cindy Sherman, Sherrie Levine and 18 others, this suggestive theme show studies artworks in which something seems to be \"almost\" something else, as in Loretta Lux's digitally massaged photograph of a beautiful child, Sylvie Fleury's chromed bronze cast of a Goodyear tire and Cardiff and Miller's video of a burning house. Don't miss Corinna Schnitt's video portrait of a wealthy couple talking about their unbelievably perfect life. JOHNSON\nG\u00dcNTER BRUS: 'DIRTY EMBELLISHMENTS,' Mike Weiss, 520 West 24th Street, (212) 691-6899, closing tomorrow. If you have only a vague idea of the sorts of things this Viennese Actionist did in the 1960s to get himself thrown in jail, you should see the fascinating compilation of films and recorded performances on view here along with recent quaintly transgressive expressionist drawings. The earliest films mix documentation and abstraction to surprisingly evocative effect; later, strictly documentary films of the artist's extremist performances are both repulsive and riveting. JOHNSON\nNATARAJ SHARMA, Bose Pacia, 508 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)989-7074, closing tomorrow. The first New York solo exhibition of this Indian painter who has exhibited internationally is too diverse to give a clear picture of what he is about, but the best works have an intriguing allegorical resonance. They are made in a neat and orderly style combining Pop, photo-based realism and hints of Indian traditionalism. Most impressive is the large picture in which a naked man peeps into a temple filled with an semiabstract orgy of interpenetrating pink bodies. JOHNSON",

    "text": "All-Embracing Man of Action for a New Era of Papacy\n2005-04-02T05:00:00.000Z\n>\nOn the night of Oct. 16, 1978, a vast, impatient throng in floodlit St. Peter's Square cheered wildly as white smoke curled from a chimney atop the Sistine Chapel, signaling the election of a new pope. A long wait had ended, but the enthusiasm was somewhat premature.\nCardinal Pericle Felici emerged minutes later to introduce Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Poland, the first non-Italian pope since 1523. But even he had trouble pronouncing the name - voy-TEE-wah. Hardly anyone, it seemed, knew who he was. Murmurs and questions rippled through the predominantly Roman crowd.\nThen a powerfully built man with slightly stooped shoulders and a small smile on his angular face stepped onto the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica. Cheers faded into silence. The crowd waited.\nHe stood at the balcony rail, looking out, a Polish stranger in the fresh white robes of the pope. And there were tears in his eyes as he began to speak.\n\"I have come,\" he said in lightly accented Italian, \"from a faraway country - far away, but always so close in the communion of faith.\"\nThere were scattered cheers, and they grew louder as he went on.\n\"I do not know whether I can express myself in your - in our - Italian language,\" he said, pausing.\nThe crowd roared appreciatively, and the laughter swelled into resounding cheers.\n\"If I make mistakes,\" he added, beaming suddenly, \"you will correct me.\"\nTumult erupted.\nThe cheers went on and on, and then grew into rhythmic waves that broke on the basilica facade and echoed across the square in a thundering crescendo:\n\"Viva il Papa!\n\"Viva il Papa!\n\"Viva il Papa!\"\n \nA Pope of a Different Sort\nIt was an extraordinary beginning. But almost from the start, it was evident to many of the world's Roman Catholics, and to multitudes of non-Catholics as well, that this was to be an extraordinary papacy, one that would captivate much of humanity by sheer force of personality and reshape the church with a heroic vision of a combative, disciplined Catholicism.\nIt was to be the longest and most luminous pontificate of the 20th century, the second longest in the history of the church, a 26-year reign that would witness sweeping political changes around the world, the growth of the Roman Catholic Church to more than a billion baptized members from 750 million, and the beginning of Christianity's Third Millennium.\nThe man who would call himself John Paul II was not the traditional papal figure, compassionate and loving but ascetic and remote behind the high walls and elaborate ceremony of the Vatican. Here was a different kind of pope: complex, schooled in confrontation, theologically intransigent but deftly politic, full of wit and daring, energy and physically expressive love.\nMore than outgoing, he was all-embracing - a bear-hugging, larger-than-life man of action who had climbed mountains, performed in plays, written books and seen war, and he was determined from the start to make the world his parish and go out and minister to its troubles and see to its spiritual needs.\nCompared with other popes, he did not create many new programs and he sought to clarify and enforce Catholic ideas rather than to reshape or expand them. He was, if anything, more traditional than his three namesake predecessors, John XXIII and Paul VI and John Paul I.\nBut he saw himself primarily as a spiritual figure who transcended geographical and ideological boundaries, and he saw it as his mission to deliver a clear set of Catholic ideas and to foster peace and human dignity through the power of faith and the practical efforts of well-meaning nations.\nAt the dawn of the millennium and in the twilight of his papacy, he also saw it as his duty to issue a daring, unprecedented apology for the errors of his church and individual Catholics over the last 2,000 years, a catalogue of sins that included episodes of religious and cultural intolerance and of historic injustices against Jews, women, indigenous peoples, immigrants and the poor.\nWhile he did not cite specific misdeeds, his apology set out a framework that theologians said appeared to encompass the Crusades, the Inquisition, the burning of heretics and forced conversions of American Indians, Africans and others. The church's response to the Holocaust was not specified, but the apology was dedicated to a \"confession of sins against the people of Israel.\"\nAnd there were other efforts at reconciliation - notably one in 1998 addressing the failure of many Catholics to help Jews in the Holocaust, and another in 2002 acknowledging the victims of sexual abuse by priests in a scandal that engulfed the church in America with cases of pedophilia and accusations of cover-ups by bishops and other members of the church hierarchy.\nThe traumatic disclosures, in which scores of priests were accused of molesting children, some repeatedly over many years, led to criminal charges, the removal of many priests and avalanches of lawsuits and multimillion-dollar settlements. It also challenged the moral authority of the church in America and threatened to taint the final years of a papacy whose signet had been human dignity.\nJohn Paul's extraordinary effort to cleanse his church's conscience, along with his global travels, his challenges to human rights violations around the world, his attacks on the economic injustices of capitalism and his steadfast resistance to changes in church teachings on birth control, priestly celibacy, the ordination of women and other issues were among the fundamental traits of his pontificate.\nBut they were not the only legacies by which history would judge John Paul. Along with the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the pope played a major role in the collapse of Soviet and European Communism, instilling the adversaries of Communist governments in Poland and other parts of Eastern Europe with confidence that their cause would outlast the repression of their rulers.\nHis very election boosted the spirit of believers in Eastern Europe, for whom the appeal \"Be not afraid!\" - repeated three times during the sermon he preached at his installation on Oct. 22, 1978 - had a special meaning.\nIn June 1979, millions turned out for the pope's first visit to his native Poland, masses of people acting independently of the Communist government and gaining a liberating sense of their own autonomy. In retrospect, the visit was widely seen as a detonator of the Solidarity labor movement's challenge to Poland's Communist government in 1980 and ultimately of the changes that swept the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe a decade later.\nTraveling widely - through Europe, Africa, the Americas and Asia - the pope electrified vast crowds with a populist blend of showmanship, evangelism and impassioned appeals for human rights, peace, disarmament and justice for the poor and the oppressed.\nOn that first papal visit to Poland, he scolded the officially atheistic Communist government for treating people \"merely as a means of production.\"\nHe went to Brazil and chastised the military junta in power. \"Violence,\" he said, \"kills what it intends to create.\"\nHe went to Ireland and confronted zealots of the Irish Republican Army and their Protestant foes: \"On my knees I beg you to turn away from the path of violence and to return to the ways of peace.\"\nHe went to Japan and mourned: \"To remember Hiroshima is to abhor nuclear war. To remember Hiroshima is to commit oneself to peace.\"\nHe went to Auschwitz and asked, \"How far can cruelty go?\"\nAnd he went to the United Nations in New York and spoke to world leaders of peace for \"all the men and women living on this planet.\" \nIntensely Physical Presence \nPeople everywhere found his presence intensely physical. Not content to wave from a passing limousine, this man with the ruddy face and glowing eyes would jump out and plunge into the crowds, hugging, kissing, grasping and talking to people; singing, smiling, winking and reaching out with his quarry-worker hands to touch and bless them.\nChiefs of protocol winced. Security men were horrified, fearing the kind of attack in which he was shot in St. Peter's Square in 1981. Aides of all kinds grew exhausted trying to keep up with him. But he was determined to take his message from St. Peter's around the globe.\nOver the quarter-century of his papacy, the pope traveled to 129 countries on 104 trips abroad. He visited and revisited Poland and made many trips through other European lands. Again and again he journeyed to Asia, South America, Central America and Africa. He made five papal visits to the mainland United States: triumphant, multicity tours in 1979 and 1987, a meeting with President Clinton in Denver in 1993, a tour in October 1995 that took him to New York, New Jersey and Baltimore, and a final visit, in 1999, to St. Louis.\nHe did not go to China or Russia, though he expressed a wish to visit both, and he met President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia at the Vatican in February 1998, shortly after journeying to Cuba. In 1993, he went to the former Soviet Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and visited Albania, Europe's poorest land, where he urged the newly non-Communist nation to nurture its long-suppressed religious freedom. He also visited several former Soviet republics - Kazakhstan and Armenia after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in America, and Azerbaijan in 2002.\nChina's Communist leaders, seeing religion as a means of political dissent, never agreed to legalize Roman Catholicism, and let Catholics worship only in an official Patriotic Church. The Vatican made overtures to Beijing in the 1990's, but did not thaw a relationship frozen over many issues, including the Vatican's recognition of Taiwan, which China considers a renegade province.\nThroughout his papacy, John Paul expressed a hope of journeying to the Holy Land, to visit the sites where Jesus lived and died and to lend his moral authority to the quest for peace in one of the world's most troubled regions. The political and logistical problems seemed insuperable until the millennium.\nThen in March 2000, he made one of his most dramatic trips, a six-day valedictory journey to Jordan, Israel and Palestinian-held territories that saw the 79-year-old pope, frail with infirmities, step nimbly through the political and religious minefields of the Middle East, a capstone of his papal travels.\nRespectful dissent was voiced by some who greeted the pope on his trips. Occasionally there were demonstrations, even some protests that turned violent. But many Vatican officials and Catholic leaders who at first had been skeptical of his travels came to see them as valuable and successful.\nOthers believed the trips were not the best way to reach people in a world saturated with electronic stimuli and entertainment extravaganzas. Spectacular trips, some theologians argued, left no lasting results; they chided the pope, calling his travels the religious equivalent of rock concerts that failed to offer something transcendent.\nAnd while many Catholic leaders said the trips had lifted the church spiritually and financially, there were complaints about the costs. The 1987 trip to the United States, for example, cost $20 million - all but $2 million of it raised by nine dioceses he visited - and some critics said the money could have been better used to aid the homeless or hard-pressed parochial schools.\nYet as the journeys mounted, it became clear to many Catholic thinkers that the travels were not mere visits to a sprawling flock, but had become a central feature of his papacy: the forceful, global reassertion of Roman Catholic orthodoxy through a new sacramental exercise using jet planes, television and a remarkable stage presence.\nIn the last year, the pope was forced to curtail his travels as the burdens of age and illness - the trembling hands and slurred speech, the inability to walk or hold his head up, and other manifest frailties of Parkinson's disease - grew increasingly heavy. He took two relatively short trips abroad last year, to Switzerland in June and to the shrine of Lourdes in France in August.\nHe continued to meet world leaders and to address major issues. He received Vice President Dick Cheney in January and met President Bush in June, using the occasions to reiterate his unhappiness over the American-led invasion of Iraq and the continuing fighting there, and he appealed for a speedy restoration of sovereignty to the Iraqi people.\nThe pope was also touched last year by a controversy over whether he had endorsed Mel Gibson's film \"The Passion of the Christ.\" The movie's promoters claimed that the pope, after a preview, had said, \"It is as it was.\" But his secretary denied there had been any appraisal. It seemed likely that the pope had been drawn into the unwitting service of a film many Jewish and Christian leaders feared would rekindle claims that Jews were collectively responsible for the Crucifixion. \nBesides the pope's limited time away from the Vatican, there were increasing signs recently that his papacy was drawing to a close. He was hospitalized for nine days in early February for treatment of breathing difficulties and influenza, and for the first time as pope he was unable to preside over Ash Wednesday services marking the start of Lent. And he was hospitalized again after suffering a respiratory relapse, and underwent a tracheotomy to ease his breathing. On Easter Sunday, he was unable for the first time to preside over Mass on the most sacred day in the Christian liturgy.\nThere were voices of concern that the pope's illness might create a vacuum of leadership for the church, and talk of a possible resignation. While four popes had resigned, the last was St. Celestine V, who abdicated five months after his election in 1294 at the age of 79. Vatican officials said John Paul was unlikely to step down, especially because one of his strongest messages - respect for human dignity at all stages of life, from the womb to the frailties of old age - had at last come full circle to encompass him.\nIn addition to his global travels, the pope asserted his mission in traditional ways as well, by appointments of like-minded cardinals and bishops around the world - in September 2003 he elevated 31 new cardinals, bringing to about 120 the number at that time who would be eligible to vote in the election of the next pope - and by papal teachings that upheld the church's condemnation of birth control, its exclusion of women from the priesthood, its requirement of celibacy for priests in the Latin rite and its suspicion of revolutionary social movements.\nOver the span of his papacy - and serving in many ways to define it - John Paul issued 14 encyclicals, or papal instructions, dealing with a wide range of topics: social and economic issues, war, the meaning of morality, doctrinal questions, faith and reason and other matters.\nIn 1979, his first encyclical, the 24,000-word \"Redemptor Hominis,\" or \"Redeemer of Man,\" expressed the core of his conviction: that caring for human life springs from the love of Christ. It also warned that mankind was living in an era of growing fear and weapons of war that raised the specter of \"unimaginable self-destruction.\" \nOther encyclicals included three statements on economic justice. In 1981, \"Laborem Exercens\" (\"On Human Work\") stressed the social character of labor and the active role of the laborer in completing the task of divine creation; it opposed government control over economies, but seemed to favor collective ownership and management by workers, a kind of democratic socialism.\n\"Sollicitudo Rei Socialis\" (\"On Social Concerns\"), in 1988, drew an unsparing picture of desperation in poor nations and pockets of deprivation in affluent societies. It blamed the East-West conflict for distorting economic development, criticizing \"liberal capitalism\" and \"Marxist collectivism.\" And it introduced a \"right of economic initiative.\" The church had upheld private property rights in the 19th century, then had gradually acknowledged society's right to regulate property. But the pope's phrase appeared to signal a new respect for innovative, entrepreneurial forces.\n\"Centesimus Annus\" (\"The Hundredth Year\"), issued in 1991 to mark the centenary of the first major papal statement on social and economic conflicts, analyzed Communism's fall and the economic issues it posed for Eastern Europe. It recognized superior dynamism in market economies over statist ones, but said Communism's failure should not blind capitalist societies to \"quasi-servitude\" in poor nations or the \"idolatry of the market\" in rich ones.\nA 1993 encyclical, \"Veritatis Splendor\" (\"The Splendor of Truth\"), was a statement of moral theory intended to encourage reflection and discussion. It did not list rights and wrongs, but discussed conscience, reason and freedom, and argued that morality rested on basic truths about human nature and the world, not on individual choice or social consensus.\nIn 1995, \"Evangelium Vitae\" (\"Gospel of Life\") denounced abortion and euthanasia as \"crimes which no human law can claim to legitimize.\" The pope also urged Catholics to oppose secular laws that violate what he called the fundamental right to life, and he reaffirmed the church's condemnation of contraception, experiments with human embryos and the death penalty.\nJohn Paul's 13th encyclical, \"Fides et Ratio\" (\"Faith and Reason\"), perhaps his most personal, marked his 20th anniversary as pope in 1998. Crystallizing a lifetime of philosophical and theological thought, it amplified upon the historic church position that faith and reason are both requisite in the search for truth, and it rejected various modern philosophical trends, including post-Enlightenment rationalism, Marxism and nihilism.\nHis 14th and last encyclical, in 2003, was a stern reminder that divorced Catholics who remarry cannot receive communion.\nThe pope's conservative views were not hard to trace. Coming as he had from a country where the church was under siege by a totalitarian government, he had found it necessary to reassert tenets of his faith and aggressively confront secular creeds competing with the church for the loyalties of the people.\nTo many Catholic leaders, particularly in the Vatican, the church at large was under similar siege when he became pope. The reforms of the Second Vatican Council in the early 1960's, which revolutionized the church by taking a more accepting attitude toward modernization after centuries of isolation from, and even hostility to, contemporary thought, had not halted the tide of secularization in the church's traditional heartland, Western Europe.\nIndeed, the cultural tumult of the 60's had only reinforced the appeal of revolutionary Marxism, the sexual revolution and other challenges to Catholic tradition. Many theologians, who viewed Pope Paul VI's tenure as a period of drift and uncertainty, regarded the moral authority of the church, and of the papacy, as being in decline.\nJohn Paul agreed that much of the church was in disarray, its long stability shaken by secularization and permissiveness. In principle, he supported the reforms of Vatican II, and often emphasized the \"collegial\" principle under which the church is governed jointly by the pope and its bishops. But he was convinced that his personal authority was the key, that through his own highly visible, international leadership, he could clarify the principles and invoke the discipline he regarded as necessary to unify and reinvigorate the church.\nBut he did not rely on personal charisma alone to carry out what some called his \"restoration.\" In 1983, he approved a revised Code of Canon Law to replace the code promulgated in 1917 and rendered out of date by many of Vatican II's reforms. In 1992, he approved a new \"universal catechism\" to guide church leaders around the world in presentations of Catholic beliefs. Both documents set firm limits on what were seen as ambiguities and invitations to further change in the documents of Vatican II.\nTo remove what he called lingering doubts, in May 1994 he reaffirmed church doctrine that women could not be ordained as priests and said the matter was not even open to debate. The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which oversees church teaching, went further in 1995 by declaring that the doctrine of ordaining only men as priests was \"infallibly\" taught - a designation reserved for teaching on faith and morals that is considered irreversible, free from error and requiring full assent from the faithful.\nThe pope carried these church views onto the world's stage. In 1994, as 180 countries planned a United Nations conference in Cairo on the potentially catastrophic population explosion projected for the 21st century, he orchestrated a campaign against draft proposals favoring abortion rights, contraception and other measures endorsed by feminists and population experts.\nThe campaign - the Vatican's most concerted in years on international policy and the pope's most heartfelt since his crusade against Communism - put a heavy strain on his relationship with President Bill Clinton, who favored safe legalized abortion and efforts to stabilize a global population that experts said could grow to 8.5 billion from 5.7 billion in 35 years.\nThe Cairo conference adopted a strong declaration endorsing family planning and giving women more control over their lives to help stabilize populations. But the Vatican shaped the language so that it did not enshrine any universal right to abortion and excluded abortion as a means of family planning.\nIn 1995, the pope appeared to be at pains to stress his support for women's rights. He credited the women's movement with positive achievements and offered an apology for injustices against women in the name of the church. But Vatican comments on the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing, signaled no major changes in church teaching that portrayed women as mothers, educators and mainstays of the family.\nIn a key appointment, John Paul placed Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger at the head of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. A brilliant theologian who had campaigned for the openness introduced by Vatican II, Cardinal Ratzinger shared the fear that the church was fragmenting and the belief that the innovations of Vatican II had to be channeled and disciplined.\nWith Cardinal Ratzinger giving a new luster and militancy to papal authority and to the conservative theology that had long prevailed in Vatican offices, John Paul's administration took a form that some regarded as a throwback to the monarchical papacies of the 19th century.\nDissident Catholic theologians were dismissed or excommunicated. Liberal cardinals and bishops were replaced. And in 1998, the pope changed canon law to put many passionately discussed issues, including euthanasia and the ordination of women, beyond the realm of debate for the faithful. He also made it almost impossible for groups like the National Conference of Catholic Bishops of the United States to make statements of doctrine or public policy that diverged from the Vatican. In the same vein, in 2003, under the pope's orders, the Vatican admonished all Roman Catholic lawmakers to oppose legalization of same-sex marriage and adoptions by gays and lesbians. In January this year, the pope unequivocally condemned gay marriage.\nOver the years, there were protests, petitions and other acts of dissent, especially in America and Europe, in response to the hard-line stances of the pope. In some countries, church attendance declined, and there were defections by priests. Predominantly Catholic Ireland voted to remove its constitutional ban on divorce, and 1.5 million Catholics in Germany signed petitions calling for the ordination of women. Italy, 84 percent Catholic, was a living protest in the 1990's: it had Europe's lowest birth rate, a sign of popular disdain for prohibitions on artificial birth control.\n No one doubted the power of John Paul's voice or the depth of the feelings he evoked. But his personal popularity aside, many Catholics - especially in America and Western Europe - were distressed by his unswerving opposition to change, even in the face of crisis. The depth of distress was never more profound than in the priest-pedophile scandals in America, which erupted in 2002 after decades of predatory abuse and suffering hidden by out-of-court settlements with victims and a revolving door of treatment and new assignments for offending priests.\n The scandals exploded in January after disclosures that Cardinal Bernard F. Law of Boston had for years sent the Rev. John J. Geoghan Jr., from parish to parish, despite accusations of serial pedophilia. The priest was eventually accused of molesting 130 children and sentenced in one case to 9 to 10 years in prison. In August 2003, the defrocked Mr. Geoghan was strangled by an inmate at a Massachusetts prison.\n Cardinal Law, under pressure, gave prosecutors the names of 80 priests accused of sexual abuse over the decades, although the Massachusetts attorney general eventually reported that at least 789 children and probably more than 1,000 had been sexually abused by 250 priests and other church workers in the Boston Archdiocese since 1940.\nWithin weeks of the disclosures, bishops across the country began a purge, removing scores of accused priests and turning names, dates and details over to prosecutors. Emboldened, hundreds of victims made accusations, many of them decades old and not prosecutable under statutes of limitations. But some criminal cases were prosecuted and hundreds of civil suits were filed. Facing enormous settlements and financial crises, some dioceses had to sell property.\n Polls showed growing disaffection among Catholics, and for months the pope and the Vatican remained aloof. But in April 2002, after the American bishops asked for guidance, the pope summoned America's cardinals to Rome for a conference on the scandals. It produced no sweeping changes. The pope acknowledged the suffering and offered an expression of concern that was taken by many to be an apology. Calling the abuse criminal and \"an appalling sin in the eyes of God,\" he said, \"To the victims and their families wherever they may be, I express my profound sense of solidarity and concern.\"\n But he sent conflicting signals on a proposed zero-tolerance policy, saying there was no place in the priesthood for those who abused minors, but then suggesting that some offenders might warrant a second chance. \"We cannot forget the power of Christian conversion, that radical decision to turn away from sin and back to God, which reaches to the depths of a person's soul and can work extraordinary change,\" he said.\n American cardinals proposed removing some priests who abused minors, but drew a distinction between serial predators and those who were \"not notorious.\" The ambiguity was unresolved, even after American bishops, meeting in Dallas in June, voted overwhelmingly for a policy that called for the removal from the ministry of any priest who had ever sexually abused a minor, and for increased cooperation with law-enforcement and a national lay board to monitor progress.\nInstead of approving the policies, however, the Vatican voiced reservations, saying the bishops had gone too far in eschewing a statute of limitations, in broadly defining child sexual abuse and in requiring that all sex abuse claims be reported to the police. The Vatican said some of the remedies might violate canon laws that protect the rights of priests, and it recommended further \"reflection\" by a commission partly controlled by Vatican emissaries.\n Cardinal Law, after nearly a year of protests and abuse lawsuits with $100 million in claims that threatened his archdiocese with bankruptcy, resigned as archbishop of Boston in December 2002. He was succeeded in July 2003 by Bishop Sean P. O'Malley, a Franciscan friar, who swiftly met with some abuse victims and began trying to heal the wounds with financial settlements and a new tone of open dialogue. Last year, the pope chose Cardinal Law to head St. Mary Major Basilica in Rome. \n Aside from the sex scandals, many American Catholics said the church and the pope were out of touch. Women, blacks, Hispanics, homosexuals, even some priests and nuns urged the pope to be more sensitive to their needs. He usually voiced sympathy, but urged the supplicants to remain faithful to church teachings, which were not altered.\nThe result was a restoration of strong centralized authority in the pope. While that strength endeared him and the church to many, it repelled others who believed that the future of Roman Catholicism lay in greater diversity and flexibility, dispersal of power and adaptability in a swiftly changing world.\nJews and Palestinians\n The pope's relations with Jews were both troubled and pathbreaking. More than any modern pope, John Paul moved boldly to end the estrangement between Catholics and Jews. He was the first pope to pray in a synagogue, the first to acknowledge the failure of individual Catholics to act against the Holocaust, the first to call anti-Semitism a sin \"against God and man,\" and the first to make an official papal visit to the Holy Land.\nJews were often dismayed by his decisions and pronouncements. But he established diplomatic relations between the Vatican and Israel and set the course of Catholic-Jewish relations on a high plane of engagement and warmth, in contrast to the distance and frigidity of earlier eras.\nHis 1982 meeting at the Vatican with Yasir Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, was met with blistering criticism from the government of Israel and from Jews around the world. The pope said afterward that he only wanted to foster peace in the Middle East. And he would not be deterred: he met Mr. Arafat eight more times.\nThe Vatican supported peace accords between Israel and the Palestinians, but debate over the status of Jerusalem was a continuous sore point: Israel saw the city as its \"united and eternal\" capital, while the Vatican pressed for its recognition as a city holy to Christians, Muslims and Jews alike.\nLong troubled by the failure of Pope Pius XII to condemn publicly the killing of millions of Jews by the Nazis in World War II, leaders of Jewish groups were outraged at John Paul's Vatican meeting in 1987 with President Kurt Waldheim of Austria, who had served in a German Army unit implicated in the deportation of Jews in Greece.\nThe pope wrote an apostolic letter in 1989 evoking Christian sorrow over the Holocaust, and in 1998 - a decade after promising to do so - issued a historic document, \"We remember: A Reflection on the Shoah,\" which apologized for the failure of many Catholics to protect Jews in the Holocaust.\nWhile the Vatican viewed the document as groundbreaking, many Jewish groups rejected it because it praised Pius XII's \"quiet diplomacy\" and did not cite his failure to speak out against the Holocaust. The church held that Pius had personally helped to save thousands of Jews, but did not publicly criticize the Nazis for fear that even more Jews as well as Catholics might be killed.\nEven after John Paul delivered the most sweeping apology ever made by a pope - a public act of repentance for the errors and misdeeds of Catholics over the last 2,000 years that was woven into the liturgy of a Sunday Mass at St. Peter's Basilica on March 12, 2000 - Jewish critics were quick to note that he had not specifically mentioned the church's behavior during the Holocaust.\nLeading Jews constantly scrutinized papal statements and often decried phrases in which they detected rebukes of Jews for rejecting Christianity or suggestions that Judaism's validity was exhausted with the coming of Jesus.\nPapal aides said the criticisms had stung the pope, who spoke often of a common Christian-Jewish biblical heritage and made other overtures to Jews. In 1985, he met Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel at the Vatican, and in 1986 made the first recorded visit by a pope to a synagogue, entering Rome's Central Synagogue and, to ringing applause, hailing Jews as \"our elder brothers.\"\nThe wounds were reopened from time to time. Jews were outraged when nuns set up a Carmelite convent at Auschwitz in 1984. Polish Catholic leaders said it would be relocated by 1989. But the deadline passed, Jewish protesters entered the grounds, and Cardinal Josef Glemp of Warsaw denounced them in a way that sounded anti-Semitic. The convent was finally closed in 1993 by a papal order.\nIn 1990, Jewish and Catholic leaders met in Prague and pledged to combat outbreaks of anti-Semitism in post-Communist Eastern Europe. The pope endorsed a call for Christian \"repentance\" for anti-Semitism made by Archbishop Edward I. Cassidy, head of the Vatican office for relations with Jews, and John Paul's standing with many Jews had been restored by 1992, when a group was formed to study diplomatic relations.\nAfter 17 months of talks, the Vatican and Israel formally recognized one another with diplomatic accords in December 1993, and six months later, in June 1994, the Holy See and Jerusalem established full diplomatic relations with an exchange of ambassadors. It was a political and religious milestone.\nBut within months, the relationship was troubled anew. In August 1994, John Paul conferred a papal knighthood on Mr. Waldheim, citing his peace efforts as United Nations secretary general from 1972 to 1980. Israeli and other Jewish leaders were outraged that the pope had honored a man who had served with Nazi units that massacred civilians, executed prisoners and deported Jews in the Balkans. Mr. Waldheim disavowed any war crimes, but the United States Justice Department called his denials unconvincing and after 1987 barred him from the United States.\nAnother painful issue for Jews - a cross erected at Auschwitz to commemorate the pope's 1979 visit - arose on a trip to his homeland in 1999, when Poland's chief rabbi, Pinchas Menachem Joskowicz, approached him on a receiving line and introduced himself as a survivor of the death camp. \"I have a favor to ask Mr. Pope,\" the rabbi said. \"I ask Mr. Pope to give a call to his people to also take this cross away from the camp.\"\nIf the pope was offended, he gave no sign, listening patiently and replying quietly. But a papal spokesman later called the cross a \"local issue\" and not a Vatican concern. \nJewish criticism of the pope was vociferous again when he beatified - and in 1998 canonized - a German convert from Judaism, Edith Stein, who became a Carmelite nun and was gassed by the Nazis at Auschwitz in 1942. While she was declared a saint as a Christian martyr, many Jews, including her relatives, insisted that she had been killed because of her Jewish background.\nThe pope acknowledged as much, but failed to mollify critics, who were also incensed by his beatification of Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, the archbishop of Zagreb during World War II, when a Nazi puppet regime ruled Croatia and 700,000 Serbs, Jews and others were sent to death camps.\n When John Paul finally made a six-day journey to the Holy Land in March 2000, it was widely seen as a personal triumph and a high point of his reign - a poignant blend of sacred and secular gestures delicately balanced in a land revered by all the Abrahamic faiths: Judaism, Islam and Christianity.\nThere had never been an official papal visit to the Holy Land, though Paul VI had made an informal trip there in 1964, staying only 12 hours and pointedly never referring to Israel. (John Paul, as Karol Wojtyla, the archbishop of Cracow, had visited Jerusalem in 1963.)\nJohn Paul made his long-awaited pilgrimage amid heavy security, traveling first to Mount Nebo in Jordan, where the Bible says Moses first looked out over the Promised Land, and on to Amman and the Jordan River site where Jesus is said to have been baptized.\nIn Tel Aviv, President Ezer Weizman and Prime Minister Ehud Barak received the pope as one of the most important visitors in Israel's history, and his presence in Jerusalem later was hailed by Israeli leaders as nothing less than a Christian affirmation of the Jewish right to a homeland.\nFor Palestinian leaders, his presence was also a symbolic triumph. He went to Mr. Arafat's home in Bethlehem and to a squalid Palestinian refugee camp. Mr. Arafat called his visit a ringing endorsement of Palestinian nationalist aspirations and a recognition of Palestinian suffering under Israeli rule.\nIn gestures to Israel's tiny Christian populations that were also moving personal experiences, the pope visited sites venerated as those of Jesus' birth, Last Supper, Crucifixion, burial and Resurrection. He also met the Greek Orthodox patriarch and leaders of the Maronite Christians, Armenian Catholics, Melchites and Chaldeans.\nIn Jerusalem, he saw the Ashkenazic and Sephardic chief rabbis, and went to Al Aksa Mosque to meet Sheik Ikrima Sabri, the city's chief Islamic cleric. He went to the Western Wall, Judaism's most sacred site and, following the custom of Jewish visitors, placed a note in a crevice, a plea for reconciliation that was the theme of his pilgrimage. At Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial, he paid homage to the six million victims of Nazi persecution.\nPolitics and Religion\nCloser to home, the pope often found himself at odds with Italians. Many were harshly critical of him for leading a campaign in 1981 to repeal Italy's liberal abortion law. The voters upheld abortion rights, and many resented what they called his interference. \nIn 1985, the Italian government and the Vatican signed an historic concordat disestablishing Roman Catholicism as the state religion; the pope said it showed church respect for Italy's independence, although he reserved the right to speak out on national issues. In 2002, John Paul became the first pope to visit the Italian Parliament, and used the occasion to call for the enactment of policies to encourage and support larger Italian families.\nHe was also criticized inside and outside the church for his opposition to \"liberation theology,\" a school of thought originating in Latin America but influential elsewhere, too. Blending biblical themes with Marxist and sometimes Leninist economic analyses, it was an underlying justification for the Catholic clergy's involvement in political struggles for justice for the poor in Latin America and other parts of the third world.\nFor years, John Paul tried to draw a delicate boundary between religious and political involvement, saying that concern for social justice was the rightful function of the Catholic clergy but that outright political action violated the calling of nuns and priests. Class struggle, he said, could not be the church's solution to social injustice.\nIn Latin America particularly, the clergy's resistance to the noninvolvement doctrine was strong. The Rev. Leonardo Boff of Brazil, a movement leader, was silenced by Rome for a year; in 1992 he resigned from the priesthood to protest Vatican restrictions on writings by the clergy and members of religious orders.\nAnother champion of liberation theology, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the first democratically elected president of Haiti, denounced the Vatican in 1992 for recognizing military leaders who had deposed him in 1991. Since 1982, when he became a priest, Father Aristide had excoriated the Haitian church for what he called its complicity with brutal dictatorships. He left the priesthood after being returned to power by United States forces in 1994, and was overthrown last year amid violent protests and charges of corruption.\nEven some members of the Curia, the Vatican's central administration, were disenchanted with the pope. Speaking behind cloaks of anonymity, some contended that he was a poor administrator, neglected necessary paper work, spent too much time traveling and was too much the showman. Some Vatican prelates said that in private he was somber, serious, enigmatic, sometimes quixotic, a man who hid his feelings and did not say much.\nCritics said he devoted too much attention to Poland and Eastern Europe and not enough to Western Europe early in his papacy. But his refusal to accept the Iron Curtain contributed forcefully to Communism's fall, and in later years he generally supported European political and cultural unification. He also made religious reconciliation a major concern.\nThere were grand ecumenical gestures. Besides his visit to the synagogue in Rome, he embraced the archbishop of Canterbury at Canterbury Cathedral in England in 1982 and prayed with another archbishop of Canterbury at the Vatican in 1996. In 2003, he met another Anglican archbishop, Rowan Williams, at the Vatican, and warned him against the ordination of gay priests, a matter that had deeply divided Anglicans. The Church of Rome and the Church of England studied ways to end a 450-year-old rift, but nothing came of it.\nThe pope also made overtures to Eastern Orthodoxy. In May 1999, he visited Bucharest, Romania, and prayed with Patriarch Teoctist; it was the first papal trip to a predominantly Orthodox country in nearly a thousand years. The schism that had kept Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christians apart since 1054 was not ended, but the visit was an ecumenical waymark.\nSix months later, the pope visited Georgia, in the Caucasus, another mainly Orthodox country. He was warmly greeted by President Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister who had also helped prod Communism's fall, but his reception by Georgian Orthodox Church leaders was guarded.\nOn the same trip, his last of the millennium, the pope went to India, where Christians, a tiny fraction of the population, had been the target of beatings, killings and other persecution. He met Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and other religious leaders, but won no support for his plea for toleration of his church's hope to evangelize Asia. \nHe undertook other interfaith dialogues. In 1983, he joined a Lutheran service and praised Martin Luther on the 500th birthday of the Reformation's leader. But no major agreements or ecclesiastical changes emerged from those contacts, and most theologians said John Paul, for all his good will toward other faiths, had not substantially advanced the ecumenical cause.\nFirst Slavic Pope\nHe was a poet, a playwright, the author of many books and hundreds of articles, a philosopher, a formidable debater, an actor, an athlete with a passion for skiing, swimming and mountain climbing, a professor of social ethics and a linguist fluent in seven languages and skilled in a dozen. But at the time of his election as 264th bishop of Rome, the pope was almost unknown outside the church hierarchy and his native Poland, where he had been a priest since 1946, the archbishop of Cracow since 1964 and a cardinal since 1967.\nThere had never been a Slavic pope. The last pontificate of a non-Italian - that of Adrian VI, a Dutchman from Utrecht - had ended 455 years earlier, in the era of Luther's rebellion in Germany. There had been 45 Italians on the throne of St. Peter since then.\nAfter the death of Pope Paul VI on Aug. 6, 1978, a majority of the College of Cardinals - the body that elects the pope - agreed that his successor should be an Italian but not connected with the Curia. On Aug. 26, the college elected Cardinal Albino Luciani, patriarch of Venice, who assumed the name John Paul I, combining those of his immediate predecessors, John XXIII and Paul VI, an expression of continuity he intended to preserve.\nBut John Paul I died a month later, on Sept. 28, and the cardinals returned for a new conclave starting Oct. 14. Predictions were that the successor would again be an Italian. But a rift developed among Italian cardinals, the largest national group in the college, and forced a compromise.\nConservatives had rallied to Cardinal Giuseppe Siri, archbishop of Genoa, a champion of orthodoxy and a candidate in every conclave since the death of Pius XII in 1958. Most moderates wanted Cardinal Giovanni Benelli, archbishop of Florence and an aide to Paul VI. In early balloting, neither came close to the required two-thirds plus one - 75 of 111 participants - and a search for a compromise candidate ensued.\nThe name of Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Poland was raised by Cardinal John Krol, the Polish-American archbishop of Philadelphia, and by Cardinal Franz KA\u0303\u00b6nig, archbishop of Vienna, and prelates from West Germany.\nCardinal Wojtyla was an attractive candidate, theologically orthodox yet a man of personal dynamism and proven political skills who could reach out to Eastern Europe and the peoples of Communist nations and the third world, one who could be a spokesman for peace, disarmament and justice in the world.\nHe had been a tough opponent of the Nazis, the Marxists and the Stalinists in Poland and was emerging as a bold voice within the church. He was also physically vigorous and only 58, 10 years younger than most popes elected in this century, and he could be expected to have a long pontificate.\nHis election, on the eighth ballot, met with almost universal astonishment outside the Sistine Chapel. But among Poland's 31 million Catholics, 92 percent of the population, and among millions of Americans of Polish descent, it was an occasion for pride and celebration that went on for days.\n A Personal Stamp\n \nThe new pope quickly set to work to put his stamp on the papacy. There were clues to its character in his earliest pronouncements. Addressing crowds on the night of his election, he twice invoked the name of the Virgin Mary and vowed total trust in her, a signal of doctrinal conservatism that would be a hallmark of his reign.\nHis greeting, \"Praised be Jesus Christ\" - an ancient earthy phrase used by Polish peasants and others in deeply Catholic rural areas of Europe, but one having an archaic ring in cosmopolitan Rome - was a sign that whatever lofty locutions were to come, his papacy would be rooted in his own humble origins.\nAccordingly, he put decorum aside and stripped daily life in the Vatican of many of its ceremonial frills. He eschewed the papal pronoun \"we\" in favor of \"I\" and did away with the pomp of a traditional triple-crown investiture, substituting an outdoor inaugural Mass in St. Peter's Square that was attended by 100,000 and seen on television around the world.\nIgnoring the usual papal preoccupation with the Curia's bureaucracy, he made it known that not all Vatican administrators would keep their jobs. In an early move to pre-empt opposition, he received the intransigent traditionalist French prelate, Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, who had been suspended two years earlier. The archbishop was excommunicated before he died.\nThe pope also received Andrei A. Gromyko, the Soviet foreign minister, and asserted that dialogue with the Communist nations was the \"only way to ease\" mutual problems. And he met the leaders of various world Jewish organizations and called for \"a fraternal dialogue and fruitful cooperation.\"\n \nOutdoorsman and Athlete\n \nThe new pope had been an athlete and outdoorsman all his life, a soccer player, backpacker, camper, boater and long-distance runner, and he looked it. He was solidly built and vigorous, with a bullish neck and strong, stooped shoulders that hinted of his youth as a laborer and factory worker. He moved with a deliberate, confident step, a graceful man for his size.\nHe was 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighed 175 pounds. His graying, once blondish hair was close-cropped, and his eyes were dark and deeply expressive, sometimes wide with mirth, sometimes narrowed to slits of concentration. His hands were fascinating: big, creased, workman's hands that swept the air in gestures of mildness or came together, poised to pray.\nHe did not smoke, but he liked a glass of wine with meals. He wrote many of his own speeches and other pronouncements longhand. While for some it shattered an old-fashioned papal image, he liked to chat, to joke and to laugh heartily. He loved to swim and refused to give it up, so he had a pool built at the papal summer palace at Castel Gandolfo. Word that the pope was taking daily dips caused no little stir and delighted cartoonists, who pictured him in the water with a miter on his head. When a high-ranking prelate suggested that the pool must have been expensive, the pope quipped, \"Holding another conclave to elect a new pope would cost even more.\"\n \nGlobal Journeys\n \nHe had traveled widely as a cardinal, visiting the United States in 1969 and 1976, Australia and Polynesia in 1973 and most of the countries of Europe on regular pilgrimages from Poland to Rome, and he resolved early to continue his sojourns as pope. His command of languages - including Polish, Latin, Italian, French, German, Spanish and English - was an enormous advantage, allowing him to speak directly to people nearly everywhere, from podiums and in the streets.\nIn January 1979, his first trip outside Italy as pope was to the Dominican Republic and Mexico, where millions heard him voice concern for the oppressed. He also rejected notions of Christ as a political or revolutionary figure, called the church's mission religious and not social or political, and added, \"The church wishes to stay free with regard to the competing systems.\"\nA Fateful Visit\n \nHis first papal journey to Poland, in June 1979, proved to be one of his most important trips. There was no way to know at the time, but the visit was, many historians say, the beginning of the end for Communism in the Soviet sphere - proof for all that the raw power of government could not overcome the power of faith.\nIt began just after the 900th anniversary of the martyrdom of St. Stanislaus, Poland's patron saint, and it exposed weaknesses in the Polish Communist government, which had long sought to extinguish fires of Catholicism.\nThe government first rejected a visit. Then, trying to limit the impact, it restricted his itinerary, muted advance publicity and refused to let workers take time off. But all that made no difference. From the moment he arrived and knelt to kiss the Polish earth until his tearful departure nine days later, his homecoming was a succession of thundering triumphs.\nFrom Warsaw to Auschwitz to Cracow, in 36 public appearances, he clasped old friends in headlocks, sang hymns and folk songs with his people, offered Masses for throngs that stretched across hillsides, and without directly attacking the government repeatedly challenged its authority. \"Christ cannot be kept out of the history of man in any part of the globe,\" he told vast crowds in Warsaw. \"The exclusion of Christ from the history of man is an act against man.\"\nCoal miners, housewives, university students, young people in blue jeans - 13 million people of every age and description - turned out to see him. They strewed his way with flowers, they sobbed joyously, and they broke into chants like football fans: \"We want God! We want God! We want God!\"\nIn Gniezno after an open-air Mass for 100,000 young people, the pope joined in singing popular songs. In Czestochowa, 500,000 pilgrims fell to their knees when he reconsecrated the nation to Mary, \"queen of Poland.\" At Auschwitz, where a million people, mostly Jews, had been killed by the Nazis, he spoke of this place \"built on hatred and contempt for man in the name of an insane ideology.\" Referring to a dedication in Hebrew for victims, he declared: \"It is not permissible for anyone to pass by this inscription with indifference.\"\nMonths later, the pope's role as a moral leader was reinforced by a journey to Ireland and the United States. He was eager to confront sectarian strife in Ulster, the erosion of the Irish church to secularization, and in the United States a church caught in turbulent debate over birth control, abortion, the role of women in the ministry and other issues.\nHis outdoor Mass in Dublin drew 1.2 million people. In Drogheda, near the border of Northern Ireland, he begged Catholics, Protestants and especially the militant I.R.A. to \"turn away from the path of violence.\"\nIn the United States, with 50 million Roman Catholics, he was a dramatic new figure in a world that seemed to lack outstanding leaders. Visiting six cities and rural Iowa in seven days, he captured national attention continuously, his every word and gesture televised and chronicled in the press. Vast crowds lined his routes, attended his Masses, heard his homilies and joined the spectacles. At each stop - in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Des Moines, Chicago and Washington - virtual holidays were declared, and public officials outdid each other with receptions of staggering magnitude.\nFor two whirlwind days, he dominated life in New York City. He addressed the United Nations, visited St. Patrick's Cathedral, offered Mass at Yankee Stadium and engaged in a playful dialogue with young people rallying at Madison Square Garden. He visited a church in Harlem, rode in a rain-soaked ticker-tape parade on lower Broadway and addressed crowds at Battery Park and Shea Stadium.\nHe often waded into enormous, friendly crowds, hugging and kissing people, saluting neighborhoods and church groups. At the Battery in a pouring rain, he said: \"I address a special word to the leaders of the Jewish community, whose presence here honors me greatly. Shalom! Peace be with you.\"\nThere were protests. In Washington, Sister Theresa Kane, president of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, surprised the pope in introducing him to an audience of nuns by saying, \"The church must regard the possibility of women being included in all the ministries of the church.\"\nAnd when he had gone, questions remained: Was the pope inflexible? Did he recognize deep frustrations of Catholics who disagreed with church teaching on sexual matters, the roles of women and the clergy? Was there even room for discussion?\nAssassination Attempt\n \nJohn Paul's life as a robust, traveling teacher-pope was altered on May 13, 1981, when a 23-year-old Turk, Mehmet Ali Agca, shot him as he rode in an open car before 10,000 people in St. Peter's Square. Bystanders seized the gunman as the pope's car sped away to Gemelli Hospital. Shot in the abdomen, right arm and left hand, he underwent five hours of surgery, and part of his intestine was removed.\nInvestigators searching Mr. Agca's past learned that he was a murderer who had escaped from a Turkish prison in 1979 and had ties to a neo-Nazi group, the Gray Wolves. But no evidence of a conspiracy to kill the pope was found. Mr. Agca was tried by the Italian authorities and sentenced to life in prison.\nThe assailant later said the shooting was a Soviet-inspired plot involving Bulgarian and Turkish agents, and investigators uncovered tantalizing details that seemed to support some of his assertions. But an Italian court in 1986 found the evidence ambiguous and acquitted three Bulgarians and three Turks of conspiracy in the case. A link between the attack and the Bulgarian government was often asserted, but never proved.\n The pope publicly forgave Mr. Agca, and in 1999 the Vatican endorsed clemency. In 2000, the Italian government pardoned Mr. Agca, who was extradited to Turkey and began serving a 10-year term there for the murder of a newspaper editor in 1979.\n \nThird Secret of FA\u0303\u00a1tima\n \nOn May 13, 2000, exactly 19 years after the shooting, the Vatican disclosed that a vision of the attempt on the pope's life was the so-called third secret of FA\u0303\u00a1tima, the last of three prophecies revealed to three Portuguese shepherd children by an apparition of the Virgin on May 13, 1917, at FA\u0303\u00a1tima, Portugal.\nFatima historians say the first secret prophesied the end of World War I and the coming of World War II, while the second supposedly predicted the spread and collapse of Communism and the resurgence of Christianity in Russia. The third, written and sent to Rome by one of the three recipients, Lucia de Jesus dos Santos, who became a Carmelite nun, was kept secret by five popes.\nFascination over the secret spawned conspiracy theories and doomsday cults, with conjectures ranging from a Catholic schism with rival papacies to nuclear annihilation. Devotees of apocalypse were deflated by the Vatican explanation. The pope did not comment, though he always credited the Virgin of FA\u0303\u00a1tima with sparing his life in the shooting.\nHealth Good and Bad\n \nDespite the seriousness of his wounds, the pope recovered, and in the years that followed, his old vigor returned, his health was strikingly good, and he was laid low by nothing worse than influenza until July 1992, when was hospitalized for a stomach problem. It turned out to be serious. Doctors excised a tumor the size of an orange from his colon and removed his gallbladder. The tumor was in an early stage of malignancy, but no chemotherapy or other treatment was deemed necessary, and he was traveling again within three months.\nIn November 1993, there was another flutter of concern when the pope tripped on the hem of his robe and fell as he descended three steps from his throne to greet visitors at the Vatican. He suffered a fractured and dislocated right shoulder, which had to be encased in a soft cast.\nFive months later, in April 1994, he fell as he climbed from a bathtub in his Vatican apartment, fracturing and dislocating his right thighbone. Surgeons replaced part of the bone near the hip socket with metal alloys.\nThe pope fell again in 1999 on a trip to Poland, suffering a head cut that required three stitches. By then, he had grown frail and had difficulty walking, even with a cane. There were other symptoms: trembling in his left hand and slurred speech that made it hard to understand his words. Privately, officials said he had Parkinson's disease and crippling arthritis; the Vatican did not confirm the diagnoses, but there was no doubt about them.\nBy 2002, the symptoms had profoundly worsened: he could not walk without aid, his hands shook so much he could not hold his speeches, and his speech was so slurred he was almost impossible to understand. In 2003, he traveled to Spain, Croatia, Bosnia, Poland and Slovakia, but sometimes garbled words and let aides finish his speeches.\n During his convalescences - from the shooting, the tumor operation and the falls - some Vatican officials privately expressed hope that he would be forced to settle down, travel less and get more involved in the problems of running the church. But John Paul, who hated to be coddled and sometimes brushed off aides who tried to help him, was determined to continue his busy life.\nA Traveling Papacy\n \nSix months after the 1981 shooting, he ventured to Umbria, in central Italy, and was soon planning new travels. In 1982 he visited 12 countries in Africa, Europe and South America, and by 1983 was traveling as widely as ever. Over the next few years he went back to Africa, Europe, South America, the Caribbean and the Far East, often to third-world countries, where the church was flourishing.\nWhile he went to Africa a dozen times, he refused for years to visit South Africa because of its apartheid racial policies. But after Pretoria's peaceful transition to a non-racial Democracy, he went to Johannesburg in 1995, met President Nelson Mandela and praised the reconciliation.\nIn 1986, the pope took a particularly long and exotic journey: two weeks and 30,000 miles to Bangladesh, Singapore, Fiji, New Zealand and Australia. He was greeted by women in saris dancing to the rhythms of sitars, aborigines in loincloths and painted faces, spear-toting tribesmen who rubbed noses with him, and bare-breasted Papuan women fluttering in traditional grass skirts.\nLater that year in Calcutta, where countless thousands slept in streets or mud huts, he went to Mother Teresa's hospice; four people died on the day of his visit. The pope was at a loss for words as he carried food among the wasted bodies. After nine days in India, he spoke of birth control guardedly and did not criticize India's government, which advocated contraception in the face of a growing population and widespread poverty.\nThe pope's second trip to the United States, in September 1987, included stops in Miami, Columbia, S.C., New Orleans, San Antonio, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Monterey, Calif., San Francisco and Detroit. He met the nation's 300 Catholic bishops in Los Angeles, and was asked to understand the attitudes of Americans.\nIn June 1993, he addressed for the first time what many American Catholics regarded as a crisis in the making: reports of sexual abuse of children and teen-agers committed by priests. In a letter to American bishops, he expressed sorrow for the victims and over demoralization inflicted on the church.\nHe returned to the United States in August 1993, stopping first in Jamaica and Mexico. In four days in Denver, he met President Clinton, joined 150,000 Catholics from 70 nations at a World Youth Day festival and denounced abortion and violence. But it was the enthusiasm for the pope - the chanting, roaring stuff of football games or rock concerts - that made the headlines.\nA month later, the pope made his first trip to the Baltic states, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, which had been Soviet republics from 1940 to 1991. The collapse of the Soviet yoke had exposed again the tangle of nationalistic, ethnic and religious rivalries from the Baltic to the Black Sea. And while the pope called for reconciliation, his visit seemed to underscore the harsh reality that mere good will could not resolve ancient bitter enmities.\nIn 1994, he canceled a visit to Sarajevo; Radovan Karadzic, the leader of Bosnia's Serbs, said his safety could not be guaranteed. But he took his call for an end to fratricidal war to Zagreb, Croatia. The pope in 1995 seemed ubiquitous: in Asia and Oceania in January (four million attended his outdoor Mass in Manila), in the Czech Republic and Poland in May, in Belgium in June, in Slovakia in July, in Africa in September and the United States in October.\nHis fourth journey to America, a five-day trip, took him back to New York, and for the first time to New Jersey and Maryland. As if making up for a canceled 1994 visit with an exhausting schedule, he saw Mr. Clinton, recited vespers in Newark, addressed the United Nations on its 50th anniversary and celebrated Masses at Giants Stadium in the New Jersey Meadowlands, Aqueduct Race Track in Queens, Central Park in Manhattan and Camden Yards in Baltimore.\nDespite his growing frailty - the slow step, the stooped shoulders, the persistent shaking hand - the pope, always a workaholic, continued his travels: in 1996 to Venezuela, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, Tunisia, Germany, Hungary and France; in 1997 to Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Czech Republic, Lebanon, Poland, France and Brazil, and in 1998 to Cuba, Nigeria and Austria.\nIn Cuba, with President Fidel Castro at his side, the pope appealed for human rights, urged the release of political prisoners and, without citing America's 37-year economic embargo, said such sanctions hurt the needy. Months later, Cuba freed 300 political prisoners and Mr. Clinton eased restrictions on aid, direct flights to Cuba and money sent to relatives by Cuban-Americans.\nThe pope made his fifth and last trip to the United States in January 1999. After four days in Mexico, where he challenged entrenched corruption and voiced support for the poor, he went to St. Louis, his only stop, and met briefly again with Mr. Clinton, who was facing impeachment at the time, and with Rosa Parks, 86, the heroine of the 1955 Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott. To 100,000 people, he decried the death penalty, which was favored by many American Catholics, and homelessness and the spread of gangs, drugs and sexual abuse.\nIn 1999, he went back to a liberated Poland for 13 nostalgic days. Greeted everywhere by huge, ecstatic crowds acutely aware of his place in national and world history, he prayed at the graves of his parents near Cracow, visited his hometown, Wadowice, and beatified 108 Poles killed by the Nazis. He made his final trip to his homeland in August 2003, an emotional farewell in which he asked people to pray for him.\nWhile the pope's travels were the most visible aspects of his papacy, his less spectacular pronouncements and actions were no less important and often much more controversial.\nIn 1980, he caused a stir by ordering the Rev. Robert F. Drinan, a Jesuit priest who represented a Massachusetts district in Congress, not to seek re-election. Father Drinan complied, but ambiguity clouded the episode. The pope had often called politics and the priesthood incompatible, but it was not clear why Father Drinan had been singled out. Some suggested he had been made an example because many Jesuits were involved in third-world political struggles.\nAt a Synod of Bishops in Rome that year, many Western prelates openly chafed at what they saw as the pope's inflexibility on divorce, abortion and artificial birth control. Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco cited studies showing that 76.5 percent of American Catholic women used contraceptives and that only 29 percent of American priests believed it was immoral. Other prelates argued that Catholics who used contraceptives could not be dismissed as \"obdurate, ignorant\" people. But the ripples of unrest produced no doctrinal changes.\nIndeed, stronger challenges were met with sterner measures. In 1986, the Rev. Charles E. Curran, a theologian who had dissented on birth control and other sexual questions, was stripped by the Vatican of his right to teach at the Catholic University of America after he refused to retract his views.\nOn other ethical questions, he warned of dangers he said were posed by organ transplants, genetic experiments, artificial insemination, birth and fertility controls and new drugs. On another matter, he conceded - 350 years after the fact - that the church had been wrong to persecute Galileo for saying the Earth circles the Sun, not the other way around. Seeking to rectify an infamous case of dogma over reason, the pope in 1992 said the astronomer-physicist should not have been forced in 1633, under threat of death, to recant his discoveries.\nIn 1996, the pope also acknowledged that the human body might not have been the immediate creation of God, but was the product of evolution, which he called \"more than just a hypothesis.\" The church had never condemned Darwin, but had warned that his ideas played into the hands of materialists and atheists.\nWhile confronting external church problems, John Paul also moved within by changing its hierarchy. His appointments of John J. O'Connor and his successor, Edward M. Egan, as archbishop in New York, Bernard F. Law as archbishop in Boston and Francis E. George to replace Cardinal Joseph Bernardin as archbishop in Chicago drew the liberal American church back to more conservative ground.\nHe further internationalized the Sacred College of Cardinals, which for centuries had a disproportionate number of Italians, by appointing many new cardinals from the third world. In 1994, he appointed 30 cardinals from 24 nations, bringing to 62 the number of nations represented; he appointed 22 more cardinals in 1998, 42 more in 2001 and 31 more in 2003.\nThe pope had a good relationship with the administration of President Ronald Reagan, which opened an embassy to the Holy See in 1984. But he rebuffed its claim that he backed its Central America policies, including aid to Contra rebels, who fought the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua. The pope held that Central American nations should work out their own problems. \nHis posture toward the two Bush administrations and the Clinton administration was cordial but strained by the pope's opposition to the 1991 Persian Gulf war, Mr. Clinton's support of abortion rights and the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.\nSimilarly, the pope often urged peace in the Middle East and said he looked with sympathy on Israelis and Palestinians, whose traditions, he said, \"should be granted equal respect.\" But his appeals never proposed concrete solutions to their age-old problems.\nPoland was an exception to his balanced, above-the-fray pronouncements. In 1980, he sang a Polish patriotic hymn in St. Peter's Square and vowed, \"We in Rome are united with our countrymen in Poland.\" He often voiced support for the Solidarity union while it was outlawed, calling it a model for human rights struggles.\nTo laymen who opposed autocratic regimes, the pope usually urged restraint, and to warring rebels he pleaded for a farewell to arms. In the Peruvian Andes, visiting a stronghold of the Maoist Shining Path movement, he urged the guerrillas to follow \"the roads of dialogue and not those of violence.\"\nThe pope also issued emotional appeals to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and President George Bush before the 1991 American-led attack on Iraqi forces in Kuwait. In 2003, he urged that the United Nations take the lead in countering Mr. Hussein. While papal statements often sounded antiwar, he denied that he favored a pacifist rejection of all warfare, noting that states had a right to defend themselves.\nWith the collapse of Soviet Communism, John Paul's long crusade against its political and economic tyrannies seemed to be over. But he was still troubled by what he saw as its unpalatable successors - unbridled Western capitalism and Communism returning by stealth in Eastern Europe. And he seemed to have no special perspective on the friction between Islam and the West that followed the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n \nPromising Early Life\n Spiritually, Karol Jozef Wojtyla was never far from the land of his birth. He was born on May 18, 1920, in Wadowice, 30 miles southwest of Cracow, the second of two children in a strict Roman Catholic family. His mother, Emilia Kaczorowska Wojtyla, of Lithuanian descent, died when he was 9. His father, Karol Wojtyla, was a sergeant in the Polish Army's quartermaster corps.\nYoung Karol was a good student in elementary and secondary schools, with a talent for languages and an interest in poetry, drama and literature. He also excelled in athletics, playing goalkeeper on his school soccer team, and in dramatics. He was popular with teachers and classmates, who called him Karolek (Little Charles) or Lolek.\nHis family was not well off. An old school employee recalled that \"Karolek always wore blue trousers that had clearly been cut from his father's discarded uniforms.\" When he was 18, his father, who had retired with a small pension, moved the family from Wadowice to Cracow. Karol's brother, Edmund, a doctor, died before the outbreak of World War II.\nAfter high school, Karol enrolled at Jagiellonian University in Cracow. But in 1939, the invading Nazis closed the university. His studies interrupted, he took a job in a stone quarry to help his ailing father make ends meet. Later, he found a laborer's job at the Solvay Chemical Works, where he helped organize a plant cafeteria.\nThe factory job provided him with a work card that protected him from deportation to a labor camp in German-occupied Poland. His fellow workers remembered him as already deeply religious: he could often be seen praying during rest periods.\nOutside work, he fell in with other young intellectuals and, with a friend, founded an underground drama group, the Rhapsodic Theater. Its productions were staged in homes, with Karol playing leads before small audiences of students and artists. Some early friends said that acting was his first love and that they had been surprised to see him turn to the priesthood.\nHe had a rich baritone voice and liked to sing popular songs at parties, accompanying himself on the guitar. He also wrote plays and poetry. One of his dramas, a morality play called \"The Goldsmith's Shop\" written under the pen name Andrzej Jawien, was translated into Italian and broadcast over Italian radio after the playwright became pope; it was also made into a 1987 film.\nHis father's death in 1941 deeply distressed the young man. A close friend at the time was Jan Tyranowski, a tailor and a mystic, who introduced him to the works of St. John of the Cross, a Spanish Carmelite mystical monk. Later, the future pope would write a postgraduate thesis on St. John.\nThere were reports that Karol Wojtyla was a member of the Polish resistance in World War II. Mieczyslaw Malinski, a friend who became a priest, scoffed at the accounts. He said that members of the underground had asked them both to join the fight against the Nazis, but that the two had declined. But Joseph L. Lichten, of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith in Rome, said that a Karol Wojtyla was active in a clandestine group that worked with the Christian Democratic movement Unia, which had a record of helping Jews, and that he had been put on a blacklist by the Germans.\nWhatever the case, there is no proof that the future pope did any fighting after leaving his factory job in 1942. What is known is that he studied for the priesthood clandestinely, taking underground Jagiellonian University courses and attending others at the Spiritual Seminary directed by Cracow's archbishop, Adam Stefan Sapieha, who became his patron. For the rest of the war, he lived in the basement of his patron's fortress-like palace.\nIn that period, he had two serious injuries. Knocked down by a streetcar on Tyniecka Street, he suffered a fractured skull. Later, he was almost crushed by a runaway truck, an accident that left him stoop-shouldered. \n \nPriest and Prelate\n \nHe was ordained a priest on Nov. 1, 1946. As the Communists took power in postwar Poland, Archbishop Sapieha urged his protA\u0303\u00a9gA\u0303\u00a9 to continue postgraduate studies abroad. Father Wojtyla was sent to Rome, where he enrolled at the Angelicum, a college operated by the Dominican order.\nIn two years, he earned a doctorate in philosophy, writing his dissertation on \"Problems of the Faith According to St. John of the Cross.\" After traveling in France and Belgium, he returned home and was assigned by the archbishop as assistant pastor in a village parish in Niegowic, in southern Poland.\nA year later, he was sent back to Cracow as an assistant at St. Florian's Church and to continue his theological studies. In 1953, he earned a second doctorate, in moral theology, and qualified as an instructor. He first lectured on social ethics at the Spiritual Seminary in Cracow; a year later he won a chair in social ethics at Catholic University in Lublin. It was a post he would retain until he became pope.\nHis reputation as a church intellectual grew rapidly, and in 1958 he was consecrated auxiliary bishop of Cracow under Archbishop Eugeniusz Baziak. At 38, he was the youngest member of the Polish church hierarchy. After the death of Archbishop Baziak in 1962, he was designated the acting archbishop, and on Jan. 13, 1964, Pope Paul VI made him archbishop of Cracow.\nVatican II Activist\n \nDuring Vatican II, Archbishop Wojtyla addressed council fathers in Rome on eight occasions, was instrumental in the adoption of a declaration on religious liberty and was active in committee work. In his most notable council speech, he contended that the church could not lay claim to religious liberty without conceding it to others.\n\"It is not the church's task to teach unbelievers,\" he said. He warned against moralizing and authoritarian postures, saying the church should not \"cry over the lamentable state of the world\" or pretend that it had \"all the answers to all the problems in it.\" He impressed the cardinals as a practical philosopher and drew the attention of the pope as well.\nOn June 26, 1967, Pope Paul VI elevated Archbishop Wojtyla to the College of Cardinals. At that time, Poland's Communist government regarded him as moderate and flexible, in contrast to Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski, the longtime patriarch of Warsaw, a hard-line anti-Communist.\nIn later years, that perception was reversed. While Cardinal Wyszynski remained viscerally anti-Marxist, he began cooperating with the government on nonideological social and economic programs advantageous to the church and the Polish people. Cardinal Wojtyla, meantime, became a tough, vocal and eloquent opponent of the government, demanding increased freedoms in education, mass media and human rights and preaching Christian alternatives to Marxism.\nIn 1969, Cardinal Wojtyla made his first trip to the United States, visiting Polish-American communities in 15 cities. \"Almost everywhere we went,\" said a priest who accompanied him, \"he laid aside his prepared remarks and spoke from the heart.\"\nCardinal Wojtyla returned to America in 1976, visiting 16 cities, including Cambridge, Mass., where Thomas E. Crooks, director of Harvard's summer school, recalled being \"floored by the sheer physical presence\" of the man. As Mr. Crooks remembered: \"He exuded such a combination of power and acceptance. He had this smile on his face and a look in his eye that said, 'You're wonderful. And I'm wonderful, too.' We had dinner with him later, and late that evening I told myself, 'This man ought to be pope.' \"\nLiterary Output\n \nJohn Paul's literary output was prodigious. Besides his encyclicals, he was the author of at least seven books - some bibliographies, counting his published commentaries, list as many as 11 - and more than 300 articles and essays, most of them in scholarly journals.\nIn the study of his archdiocesan residence on Franciszkanska Street in Cracow, a visitor in 1978 found 1,500 books on the shelves, including the works of ancient and modern philosophers, leaders of the church in Greek and Latin, and 20th-century avant-garde theologians, as well as volumes on many subjects in various languages. One of the few novels was \"The Shoes of the Fisherman,\" Morris West's 1963 tale of a pope from the Soviet Union.\nBooks by the future pope included \"The Foundations of Renewal,\" a 1957 work on philosophical and moral subjects; \"Love and Responsibility,\" originally lectures on sex, marriage and birth control, that was published in 1962; and \"The Acting Person,\" a 1969 phenomenological treatise. His output as pope included \"Sign of Contradiction,\" a 1979 spiritual testament, and \"The Future of the Church,\" a study of Vatican II directives, which appeared in English in 1979.\nA collection of essays, \"Crossing the Threshold of Hope,\" was published in October 1994 in 21 languages in 35 countries - in English by Alfred A. Knopf. Knopf's parent, Random House, paid a $9 million advance, and the book was on the best-seller lists in America for months. The pope donated all of the income to charity. A commercially published book by a sitting pope was unheard of in modern times. Experts say the last such publication, outside of speeches, teaching documents and other official communications, was a 1748 work on diocesan synods by Pope Benedict XIV. His last book, \"Memory and Identity,\" published this year, discussed freedom, patriotism and European integration. Last year, 25 European countries signed a constitution that does not mention the Continent's Christian roots, despite the Vatican's repeated calls that it do so.\nHe also wrote a great deal of poetry. A collection of his free verse was published by Random House in 1979 as \"Easter Vigil and Other Poems,\" and \"Roman Triptych - Meditations,\" which appeared in 2003. One poem published in Cracow under the pen name Andrzej Jawien was titled, \"The Rock.\" Written after a stroll in St. Peter's Square, it reads in translation:\nIn this place our feet meet with earth from which so many walls and columns spring.\nIf you don't get lost among them\nBut go on finding oneness and meaning,\nIt's because that very earth leads you.\nHere she not only bridges \nThe spaces of a Renaissance building\nBut also vaults interiors within ourselves\n Who grow so very conscious of our weaknesses and failures.\n It's you, Peter. You want to serve as the substratum here for those who stagger\nToward some unknown goal, to make them go where you would lead their feet\nSo that spaces can be bridged through sight that helps thought to be born.\nYou want to be the one to serve the feet, just as a rock serves the hoofs of sheep:\nThe rock is also the substratum of this gigantic temple.\nThe pasture is the cross. \n In his homeland, he also left a major monument to his faith and perseverance: the starkly modern Church of Our Lady, Queen of Poland, which rises at Nowa Huta, the new iron and steel center east of Cracow. While the authorities had long opposed the project in the Communist era, voluntary contributions were raised, and scarce building materials were scraped together. Somehow construction permits were obtained and volunteer workers took turns at the building site.\n It took more than a decade, but the project was dedicated in 1977. In a homily at the time, the future pope declared that men had a right to more than a job and a living wage.\n \"There are more profound rights of the human spirit that cannot be violated,\" he said. \"These are the rights of freedom of the human spirit, freedom of human conscience, freedom of belief and freedom of religion.\"",

    "text": "All-Embracing Man of Action for a New Era of Papacy\n2005-04-01T05:00:00.000Z\n>\nOn the night of Oct. 16, 1978, a vast, impatient throng in floodlit St. Peter's Square cheered wildly as white smoke curled from a chimney atop the Sistine Chapel, signaling the election of a new pope. A long wait had ended, but the enthusiasm was somewhat premature.\nCardinal Pericle Felici emerged minutes later to introduce Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Poland, the first non-Italian pope since 1523. But even he had trouble pronouncing the name - voy-TEE-wah. Hardly anyone, it seemed, knew who he was. Murmurs and questions rippled through the predominantly Roman crowd.\nThen a powerfully built man with slightly stooped shoulders and a small smile on his angular face stepped onto the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica. Cheers faded into silence. The crowd waited.\nHe stood at the balcony rail, looking out, a Polish stranger in the fresh white robes of the pope. And there were tears in his eyes as he began to speak.\n\"I have come,\" he said in lightly accented Italian, \"from a faraway country - far away, but always so close in the communion of faith.\"\nThere were scattered cheers, and they grew louder as he went on.\n\"I do not know whether I can express myself in your - in our - Italian language,\" he said, pausing.\nThe crowd roared appreciatively, and the laughter swelled into resounding cheers.\n\"If I make mistakes,\" he added, beaming suddenly, \"you will correct me.\"\nTumult erupted.\nThe cheers went on and on, and then grew into rhythmic waves that broke on the basilica facade and echoed across the square in a thundering crescendo:\n\"Viva il Papa!\n\"Viva il Papa!\n\"Viva il Papa!\"\n \nA Pope of a Different Sort\nIt was an extraordinary beginning. But almost from the start, it was evident to many of the world's Roman Catholics, and to multitudes of non-Catholics as well, that this was to be an extraordinary papacy, one that would captivate much of humanity by sheer force of personality and reshape the church with a heroic vision of a combative, disciplined Catholicism.\nIt was to be the longest and most luminous pontificate of the 20th century, the second longest in the history of the church, a 26-year reign that would witness sweeping political changes around the world, the growth of the Roman Catholic Church to more than a billion baptized members from 750 million, and the beginning of Christianity's Third Millennium.\nThe man who would call himself John Paul II was not the traditional papal figure, compassionate and loving but ascetic and remote behind the high walls and elaborate ceremony of the Vatican. Here was a different kind of pope: complex, schooled in confrontation, theologically intransigent but deftly politic, full of wit and daring, energy and physically expressive love.\nMore than outgoing, he was all-embracing - a bear-hugging, larger-than-life man of action who had climbed mountains, performed in plays, written books and seen war, and he was determined from the start to make the world his parish and go out and minister to its troubles and see to its spiritual needs.\nCompared with other popes, he did not create many new programs and he sought to clarify and enforce Catholic ideas rather than to reshape or expand them. He was, if anything, more traditional than his three namesake predecessors, John XXIII and Paul VI and John Paul I.\nBut he saw himself primarily as a spiritual figure who transcended geographical and ideological boundaries, and he saw it as his mission to deliver a clear set of Catholic ideas and to foster peace and human dignity through the power of faith and the practical efforts of well-meaning nations.\nAt the dawn of the millennium and in the twilight of his papacy, he also saw it as his duty to issue a daring, unprecedented apology for the errors of his church and individual Catholics over the last 2,000 years, a catalogue of sins that included episodes of religious and cultural intolerance and of historic injustices against Jews, women, indigenous peoples, immigrants and the poor.\nWhile he did not cite specific misdeeds, his apology set out a framework that theologians said appeared to encompass the Crusades, the Inquisition, the burning of heretics and forced conversions of American Indians, Africans and others. The church's response to the Holocaust was not specified, but the apology was dedicated to a \"confession of sins against the people of Israel.\"\nAnd there were other efforts at reconciliation - notably one in 1998 addressing the failure of many Catholics to help Jews in the Holocaust, and another in 2002 acknowledging the victims of sexual abuse by priests in a scandal that engulfed the church in America with cases of pedophilia and accusations of cover-ups by bishops and other members of the church hierarchy.\nThe traumatic disclosures, in which scores of priests were accused of molesting children, some repeatedly over many years, led to criminal charges, the removal of many priests and avalanches of lawsuits and multimillion-dollar settlements. It also challenged the moral authority of the church in America and threatened to taint the final years of a papacy whose signet had been human dignity.\nJohn Paul's extraordinary effort to cleanse his church's conscience, along with his global travels, his challenges to human rights violations around the world, his attacks on the economic injustices of capitalism and his steadfast resistance to changes in church teachings on birth control, priestly celibacy, the ordination of women and other issues were among the fundamental traits of his pontificate.\nBut they were not the only legacies by which history would judge John Paul. Along with the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the pope played a major role in the collapse of Soviet and European Communism, instilling the adversaries of Communist governments in Poland and other parts of Eastern Europe with confidence that their cause would outlast the repression of their rulers.\nHis very election boosted the spirit of believers in Eastern Europe, for whom the appeal \"Be not afraid!\" - repeated three times during the sermon he preached at his installation on Oct. 22, 1978 - had a special meaning.\nIn June 1979, millions turned out for the pope's first visit to his native Poland, masses of people acting independently of the Communist government and gaining a liberating sense of their own autonomy. In retrospect, the visit was widely seen as a detonator of the Solidarity labor movement's challenge to Poland's Communist government in 1980 and ultimately of the changes that swept the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe a decade later.\nTraveling widely - through Europe, Africa, the Americas and Asia - the pope electrified vast crowds with a populist blend of showmanship, evangelism and impassioned appeals for human rights, peace, disarmament and justice for the poor and the oppressed.\nOn that first papal visit to Poland, he scolded the officially atheistic Communist government for treating people \"merely as a means of production.\"\nHe went to Brazil and chastised the military junta in power. \"Violence,\" he said, \"kills what it intends to create.\"\nHe went to Ireland and confronted zealots of the Irish Republican Army and their Protestant foes: \"On my knees I beg you to turn away from the path of violence and to return to the ways of peace.\"\nHe went to Japan and mourned: \"To remember Hiroshima is to abhor nuclear war. To remember Hiroshima is to commit oneself to peace.\"\nHe went to Auschwitz and asked, \"How far can cruelty go?\"\nAnd he went to the United Nations in New York and spoke to world leaders of peace for \"all the men and women living on this planet.\" \nIntensely Physical Presence \nPeople everywhere found his presence intensely physical. Not content to wave from a passing limousine, this man with the ruddy face and glowing eyes would jump out and plunge into the crowds, hugging, kissing, grasping and talking to people; singing, smiling, winking and reaching out with his quarry-worker hands to touch and bless them.\nChiefs of protocol winced. Security men were horrified, fearing the kind of attack in which he was shot in St. Peter's Square in 1981. Aides of all kinds grew exhausted trying to keep up with him. But he was determined to take his message from St. Peter's around the globe.\nOver the quarter-century of his papacy, the pope traveled to 129 countries on 104 trips abroad. He visited and revisited Poland and made many trips through other European lands. Again and again he journeyed to Asia, South America, Central America and Africa. He made five papal visits to the mainland United States: triumphant, multicity tours in 1979 and 1987, a meeting with President Clinton in Denver in 1993, a tour in October 1995 that took him to New York, New Jersey and Baltimore, and a final visit, in 1999, to St. Louis.\nHe did not go to China or Russia, though he expressed a wish to visit both, and he met President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia at the Vatican in February 1998, shortly after journeying to Cuba. In 1993, he went to the former Soviet Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and visited Albania, Europe's poorest land, where he urged the newly non-Communist nation to nurture its long-suppressed religious freedom. He also visited several former Soviet republics - Kazakhstan and Armenia after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in America, and Azerbaijan in 2002.\nChina's Communist leaders, seeing religion as a means of political dissent, never agreed to legalize Roman Catholicism, and let Catholics worship only in an official Patriotic Church. The Vatican made overtures to Beijing in the 1990's, but did not thaw a relationship frozen over many issues, including the Vatican's recognition of Taiwan, which China considers a renegade province.\nThroughout his papacy, John Paul expressed a hope of journeying to the Holy Land, to visit the sites where Jesus lived and died and to lend his moral authority to the quest for peace in one of the world's most troubled regions. The political and logistical problems seemed insuperable until the millennium.\nThen in March 2000, he made one of his most dramatic trips, a six-day valedictory journey to Jordan, Israel and Palestinian-held territories that saw the 79-year-old pope, frail with infirmities, step nimbly through the political and religious minefields of the Middle East, a capstone of his papal travels.\nRespectful dissent was voiced by some who greeted the pope on his trips. Occasionally there were demonstrations, even some protests that turned violent. But many Vatican officials and Catholic leaders who at first had been skeptical of his travels came to see them as valuable and successful.\nOthers believed the trips were not the best way to reach people in a world saturated with electronic stimuli and entertainment extravaganzas. Spectacular trips, some theologians argued, left no lasting results; they chided the pope, calling his travels the religious equivalent of rock concerts that failed to offer something transcendent.\nAnd while many Catholic leaders said the trips had lifted the church spiritually and financially, there were complaints about the costs. The 1987 trip to the United States, for example, cost $20 million - all but $2 million of it raised by nine dioceses he visited - and some critics said the money could have been better used to aid the homeless or hard-pressed parochial schools.\nYet as the journeys mounted, it became clear to many Catholic thinkers that the travels were not mere visits to a sprawling flock, but had become a central feature of his papacy: the forceful, global reassertion of Roman Catholic orthodoxy through a new sacramental exercise using jet planes, television and a remarkable stage presence.\nIn the last year, the pope was forced to curtail his travels as the burdens of age and illness - the trembling hands and slurred speech, the inability to walk or hold his head up, and other manifest frailties of Parkinson's disease - grew increasingly heavy. He took two relatively short trips abroad last year, to Switzerland in June and to the shrine of Lourdes in France in August.\nHe continued to meet world leaders and to address major issues. He received Vice President Dick Cheney in January and met President Bush in June, using the occasions to reiterate his unhappiness over the American-led invasion of Iraq and the continuing fighting there, and he appealed for a speedy restoration of sovereignty to the Iraqi people.\nThe pope was also touched last year by a controversy over whether he had endorsed Mel Gibson's film \"The Passion of the Christ.\" The movie's promoters claimed that the pope, after a preview, had said, \"It is as it was.\" But his secretary denied there had been any appraisal. It seemed likely that the pope had been drawn into the unwitting service of a film many Jewish and Christian leaders feared would rekindle claims that Jews were collectively responsible for the Crucifixion. \nBesides the pope's limited time away from the Vatican, there were increasing signs recently that his papacy was drawing to a close. He was hospitalized for nine days in early February for treatment of breathing difficulties and influenza, and for the first time as pope he was unable to preside over Ash Wednesday services marking the start of Lent. And he was hospitalized again after suffering a respiratory relapse, and underwent a tracheotomy to ease his breathing. On Easter Sunday, he was unable for the first time to preside over Mass on the most sacred day in the Christian liturgy.\nThere were voices of concern that the pope's illness might create a vacuum of leadership for the church, and talk of a possible resignation. While four popes had resigned, the last was St. Celestine V, who abdicated five months after his election in 1294 at the age of 79. Vatican officials said John Paul was unlikely to step down, especially because one of his strongest messages - respect for human dignity at all stages of life, from the womb to the frailties of old age - had at last come full circle to encompass him.\nIn addition to his global travels, the pope asserted his mission in traditional ways as well, by appointments of like-minded cardinals and bishops around the world - in September 2003 he elevated 31 new cardinals, bringing to about 120 the number at that time who would be eligible to vote in the election of the next pope - and by papal teachings that upheld the church's condemnation of birth control, its exclusion of women from the priesthood, its requirement of celibacy for priests in the Latin rite and its suspicion of revolutionary social movements.\nOver the span of his papacy - and serving in many ways to define it - John Paul issued 14 encyclicals, or papal instructions, dealing with a wide range of topics: social and economic issues, war, the meaning of morality, doctrinal questions, faith and reason and other matters.\nIn 1979, his first encyclical, the 24,000-word \"Redemptor Hominis,\" or \"Redeemer of Man,\" expressed the core of his conviction: that caring for human life springs from the love of Christ. It also warned that mankind was living in an era of growing fear and weapons of war that raised the specter of \"unimaginable self-destruction.\" \nOther encyclicals included three statements on economic justice. In 1981, \"Laborem Exercens\" (\"On Human Work\") stressed the social character of labor and the active role of the laborer in completing the task of divine creation; it opposed government control over economies, but seemed to favor collective ownership and management by workers, a kind of democratic socialism.\n\"Sollicitudo Rei Socialis\" (\"On Social Concerns\"), in 1988, drew an unsparing picture of desperation in poor nations and pockets of deprivation in affluent societies. It blamed the East-West conflict for distorting economic development, criticizing \"liberal capitalism\" and \"Marxist collectivism.\" And it introduced a \"right of economic initiative.\" The church had upheld private property rights in the 19th century, then had gradually acknowledged society's right to regulate property. But the pope's phrase appeared to signal a new respect for innovative, entrepreneurial forces.\n\"Centesimus Annus\" (\"The Hundredth Year\"), issued in 1991 to mark the centenary of the first major papal statement on social and economic conflicts, analyzed Communism's fall and the economic issues it posed for Eastern Europe. It recognized superior dynamism in market economies over statist ones, but said Communism's failure should not blind capitalist societies to \"quasi-servitude\" in poor nations or the \"idolatry of the market\" in rich ones.\nA 1993 encyclical, \"Veritatis Splendor\" (\"The Splendor of Truth\"), was a statement of moral theory intended to encourage reflection and discussion. It did not list rights and wrongs, but discussed conscience, reason and freedom, and argued that morality rested on basic truths about human nature and the world, not on individual choice or social consensus.\nIn 1995, \"Evangelium Vitae\" (\"Gospel of Life\") denounced abortion and euthanasia as \"crimes which no human law can claim to legitimize.\" The pope also urged Catholics to oppose secular laws that violate what he called the fundamental right to life, and he reaffirmed the church's condemnation of contraception, experiments with human embryos and the death penalty.\nJohn Paul's 13th encyclical, \"Fides et Ratio\" (\"Faith and Reason\"), perhaps his most personal, marked his 20th anniversary as pope in 1998. Crystallizing a lifetime of philosophical and theological thought, it amplified upon the historic church position that faith and reason are both requisite in the search for truth, and it rejected various modern philosophical trends, including post-Enlightenment rationalism, Marxism and nihilism.\nHis 14th and last encyclical, in 2003, was a stern reminder that divorced Catholics who remarry cannot receive communion.\nThe pope's conservative views were not hard to trace. Coming as he had from a country where the church was under siege by a totalitarian government, he had found it necessary to reassert tenets of his faith and aggressively confront secular creeds competing with the church for the loyalties of the people.\nTo many Catholic leaders, particularly in the Vatican, the church at large was under similar siege when he became pope. The reforms of the Second Vatican Council in the early 1960's, which revolutionized the church by taking a more accepting attitude toward modernization after centuries of isolation from, and even hostility to, contemporary thought, had not halted the tide of secularization in the church's traditional heartland, Western Europe.\nIndeed, the cultural tumult of the 60's had only reinforced the appeal of revolutionary Marxism, the sexual revolution and other challenges to Catholic tradition. Many theologians, who viewed Pope Paul VI's tenure as a period of drift and uncertainty, regarded the moral authority of the church, and of the papacy, as being in decline.\nJohn Paul agreed that much of the church was in disarray, its long stability shaken by secularization and permissiveness. In principle, he supported the reforms of Vatican II, and often emphasized the \"collegial\" principle under which the church is governed jointly by the pope and its bishops. But he was convinced that his personal authority was the key, that through his own highly visible, international leadership, he could clarify the principles and invoke the discipline he regarded as necessary to unify and reinvigorate the church.\nBut he did not rely on personal charisma alone to carry out what some called his \"restoration.\" In 1983, he approved a revised Code of Canon Law to replace the code promulgated in 1917 and rendered out of date by many of Vatican II's reforms. In 1992, he approved a new \"universal catechism\" to guide church leaders around the world in presentations of Catholic beliefs. Both documents set firm limits on what were seen as ambiguities and invitations to further change in the documents of Vatican II.\nTo remove what he called lingering doubts, in May 1994 he reaffirmed church doctrine that women could not be ordained as priests and said the matter was not even open to debate. The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which oversees church teaching, went further in 1995 by declaring that the doctrine of ordaining only men as priests was \"infallibly\" taught - a designation reserved for teaching on faith and morals that is considered irreversible, free from error and requiring full assent from the faithful.\nThe pope carried these church views onto the world's stage. In 1994, as 180 countries planned a United Nations conference in Cairo on the potentially catastrophic population explosion projected for the 21st century, he orchestrated a campaign against draft proposals favoring abortion rights, contraception and other measures endorsed by feminists and population experts.\nThe campaign - the Vatican's most concerted in years on international policy and the pope's most heartfelt since his crusade against Communism - put a heavy strain on his relationship with President Bill Clinton, who favored safe legalized abortion and efforts to stabilize a global population that experts said could grow to 8.5 billion from 5.7 billion in 35 years.\nThe Cairo conference adopted a strong declaration endorsing family planning and giving women more control over their lives to help stabilize populations. But the Vatican shaped the language so that it did not enshrine any universal right to abortion and excluded abortion as a means of family planning.\nIn 1995, the pope appeared to be at pains to stress his support for women's rights. He credited the women's movement with positive achievements and offered an apology for injustices against women in the name of the church. But Vatican comments on the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing, signaled no major changes in church teaching that portrayed women as mothers, educators and mainstays of the family.\nIn a key appointment, John Paul placed Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger at the head of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. A brilliant theologian who had campaigned for the openness introduced by Vatican II, Cardinal Ratzinger shared the fear that the church was fragmenting and the belief that the innovations of Vatican II had to be channeled and disciplined.\nWith Cardinal Ratzinger giving a new luster and militancy to papal authority and to the conservative theology that had long prevailed in Vatican offices, John Paul's administration took a form that some regarded as a throwback to the monarchical papacies of the 19th century.\nDissident Catholic theologians were dismissed or excommunicated. Liberal cardinals and bishops were replaced. And in 1998, the pope changed canon law to put many passionately discussed issues, including euthanasia and the ordination of women, beyond the realm of debate for the faithful. He also made it almost impossible for groups like the National Conference of Catholic Bishops of the United States to make statements of doctrine or public policy that diverged from the Vatican. In the same vein, in 2003, under the pope's orders, the Vatican admonished all Roman Catholic lawmakers to oppose legalization of same-sex marriage and adoptions by gays and lesbians. In January this year, the pope unequivocally condemned gay marriage.\nOver the years, there were protests, petitions and other acts of dissent, especially in America and Europe, in response to the hard-line stances of the pope. In some countries, church attendance declined, and there were defections by priests. Predominantly Catholic Ireland voted to remove its constitutional ban on divorce, and 1.5 million Catholics in Germany signed petitions calling for the ordination of women. Italy, 84 percent Catholic, was a living protest in the 1990's: it had Europe's lowest birth rate, a sign of popular disdain for prohibitions on artificial birth control.\n No one doubted the power of John Paul's voice or the depth of the feelings he evoked. But his personal popularity aside, many Catholics - especially in America and Western Europe - were distressed by his unswerving opposition to change, even in the face of crisis. The depth of distress was never more profound than in the priest-pedophile scandals in America, which erupted in 2002 after decades of predatory abuse and suffering hidden by out-of-court settlements with victims and a revolving door of treatment and new assignments for offending priests.\n The scandals exploded in January after disclosures that Cardinal Bernard F. Law of Boston had for years sent the Rev. John J. Geoghan Jr., from parish to parish, despite accusations of serial pedophilia. The priest was eventually accused of molesting 130 children and sentenced in one case to 9 to 10 years in prison. In August 2003, the defrocked Mr. Geoghan was strangled by an inmate at a Massachusetts prison.\n Cardinal Law, under pressure, gave prosecutors the names of 80 priests accused of sexual abuse over the decades, although the Massachusetts attorney general eventually reported that at least 789 children and probably more than 1,000 had been sexually abused by 250 priests and other church workers in the Boston Archdiocese since 1940.\nWithin weeks of the disclosures, bishops across the country began a purge, removing scores of accused priests and turning names, dates and details over to prosecutors. Emboldened, hundreds of victims made accusations, many of them decades old and not prosecutable under statutes of limitations. But some criminal cases were prosecuted and hundreds of civil suits were filed. Facing enormous settlements and financial crises, some dioceses had to sell property.\n Polls showed growing disaffection among Catholics, and for months the pope and the Vatican remained aloof. But in April 2002, after the American bishops asked for guidance, the pope summoned America's cardinals to Rome for a conference on the scandals. It produced no sweeping changes. The pope acknowledged the suffering and offered an expression of concern that was taken by many to be an apology. Calling the abuse criminal and \"an appalling sin in the eyes of God,\" he said, \"To the victims and their families wherever they may be, I express my profound sense of solidarity and concern.\"\n But he sent conflicting signals on a proposed zero-tolerance policy, saying there was no place in the priesthood for those who abused minors, but then suggesting that some offenders might warrant a second chance. \"We cannot forget the power of Christian conversion, that radical decision to turn away from sin and back to God, which reaches to the depths of a person's soul and can work extraordinary change,\" he said.\n American cardinals proposed removing some priests who abused minors, but drew a distinction between serial predators and those who were \"not notorious.\" The ambiguity was unresolved, even after American bishops, meeting in Dallas in June, voted overwhelmingly for a policy that called for the removal from the ministry of any priest who had ever sexually abused a minor, and for increased cooperation with law-enforcement and a national lay board to monitor progress.\nInstead of approving the policies, however, the Vatican voiced reservations, saying the bishops had gone too far in eschewing a statute of limitations, in broadly defining child sexual abuse and in requiring that all sex abuse claims be reported to the police. The Vatican said some of the remedies might violate canon laws that protect the rights of priests, and it recommended further \"reflection\" by a commission partly controlled by Vatican emissaries.\n Cardinal Law, after nearly a year of protests and abuse lawsuits with $100 million in claims that threatened his archdiocese with bankruptcy, resigned as archbishop of Boston in December 2002. He was succeeded in July 2003 by Bishop Sean P. O'Malley, a Franciscan friar, who swiftly met with some abuse victims and began trying to heal the wounds with financial settlements and a new tone of open dialogue. Last year, the pope chose Cardinal Law to head St. Mary Major Basilica in Rome. \n Aside from the sex scandals, many American Catholics said the church and the pope were out of touch. Women, blacks, Hispanics, homosexuals, even some priests and nuns urged the pope to be more sensitive to their needs. He usually voiced sympathy, but urged the supplicants to remain faithful to church teachings, which were not altered.\nThe result was a restoration of strong centralized authority in the pope. While that strength endeared him and the church to many, it repelled others who believed that the future of Roman Catholicism lay in greater diversity and flexibility, dispersal of power and adaptability in a swiftly changing world.\nJews and Palestinians\n The pope's relations with Jews were both troubled and pathbreaking. More than any modern pope, John Paul moved boldly to end the estrangement between Catholics and Jews. He was the first pope to pray in a synagogue, the first to acknowledge the failure of individual Catholics to act against the Holocaust, the first to call anti-Semitism a sin \"against God and man,\" and the first to make an official papal visit to the Holy Land.\nJews were often dismayed by his decisions and pronouncements. But he established diplomatic relations between the Vatican and Israel and set the course of Catholic-Jewish relations on a high plane of engagement and warmth, in contrast to the distance and frigidity of earlier eras.\nHis 1982 meeting at the Vatican with Yasir Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, was met with blistering criticism from the government of Israel and from Jews around the world. The pope said afterward that he only wanted to foster peace in the Middle East. And he would not be deterred: he met Mr. Arafat eight more times.\nThe Vatican supported peace accords between Israel and the Palestinians, but debate over the status of Jerusalem was a continuous sore point: Israel saw the city as its \"united and eternal\" capital, while the Vatican pressed for its recognition as a city holy to Christians, Muslims and Jews alike.\nLong troubled by the failure of Pope Pius XII to condemn publicly the killing of millions of Jews by the Nazis in World War II, leaders of Jewish groups were outraged at John Paul's Vatican meeting in 1987 with President Kurt Waldheim of Austria, who had served in a German Army unit implicated in the deportation of Jews in Greece.\nThe pope wrote an apostolic letter in 1989 evoking Christian sorrow over the Holocaust, and in 1998 - a decade after promising to do so - issued a historic document, \"We remember: A Reflection on the Shoah,\" which apologized for the failure of many Catholics to protect Jews in the Holocaust.\nWhile the Vatican viewed the document as groundbreaking, many Jewish groups rejected it because it praised Pius XII's \"quiet diplomacy\" and did not cite his failure to speak out against the Holocaust. The church held that Pius had personally helped to save thousands of Jews, but did not publicly criticize the Nazis for fear that even more Jews as well as Catholics might be killed.\nEven after John Paul delivered the most sweeping apology ever made by a pope - a public act of repentance for the errors and misdeeds of Catholics over the last 2,000 years that was woven into the liturgy of a Sunday Mass at St. Peter's Basilica on March 12, 2000 - Jewish critics were quick to note that he had not specifically mentioned the church's behavior during the Holocaust.\nLeading Jews constantly scrutinized papal statements and often decried phrases in which they detected rebukes of Jews for rejecting Christianity or suggestions that Judaism's validity was exhausted with the coming of Jesus.\nPapal aides said the criticisms had stung the pope, who spoke often of a common Christian-Jewish biblical heritage and made other overtures to Jews. In 1985, he met Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel at the Vatican, and in 1986 made the first recorded visit by a pope to a synagogue, entering Rome's Central Synagogue and, to ringing applause, hailing Jews as \"our elder brothers.\"\nThe wounds were reopened from time to time. Jews were outraged when nuns set up a Carmelite convent at Auschwitz in 1984. Polish Catholic leaders said it would be relocated by 1989. But the deadline passed, Jewish protesters entered the grounds, and Cardinal Josef Glemp of Warsaw denounced them in a way that sounded anti-Semitic. The convent was finally closed in 1993 by a papal order.\nIn 1990, Jewish and Catholic leaders met in Prague and pledged to combat outbreaks of anti-Semitism in post-Communist Eastern Europe. The pope endorsed a call for Christian \"repentance\" for anti-Semitism made by Archbishop Edward I. Cassidy, head of the Vatican office for relations with Jews, and John Paul's standing with many Jews had been restored by 1992, when a group was formed to study diplomatic relations.\nAfter 17 months of talks, the Vatican and Israel formally recognized one another with diplomatic accords in December 1993, and six months later, in June 1994, the Holy See and Jerusalem established full diplomatic relations with an exchange of ambassadors. It was a political and religious milestone.\nBut within months, the relationship was troubled anew. In August 1994, John Paul conferred a papal knighthood on Mr. Waldheim, citing his peace efforts as United Nations secretary general from 1972 to 1980. Israeli and other Jewish leaders were outraged that the pope had honored a man who had served with Nazi units that massacred civilians, executed prisoners and deported Jews in the Balkans. Mr. Waldheim disavowed any war crimes, but the United States Justice Department called his denials unconvincing and after 1987 barred him from the United States.\nAnother painful issue for Jews - a cross erected at Auschwitz to commemorate the pope's 1979 visit - arose on a trip to his homeland in 1999, when Poland's chief rabbi, Pinchas Menachem Joskowicz, approached him on a receiving line and introduced himself as a survivor of the death camp. \"I have a favor to ask Mr. Pope,\" the rabbi said. \"I ask Mr. Pope to give a call to his people to also take this cross away from the camp.\"\nIf the pope was offended, he gave no sign, listening patiently and replying quietly. But a papal spokesman later called the cross a \"local issue\" and not a Vatican concern. \nJewish criticism of the pope was vociferous again when he beatified - and in 1998 canonized - a German convert from Judaism, Edith Stein, who became a Carmelite nun and was gassed by the Nazis at Auschwitz in 1942. While she was declared a saint as a Christian martyr, many Jews, including her relatives, insisted that she had been killed because of her Jewish background.\nThe pope acknowledged as much, but failed to mollify critics, who were also incensed by his beatification of Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, the archbishop of Zagreb during World War II, when a Nazi puppet regime ruled Croatia and 700,000 Serbs, Jews and others were sent to death camps.\n When John Paul finally made a six-day journey to the Holy Land in March 2000, it was widely seen as a personal triumph and a high point of his reign - a poignant blend of sacred and secular gestures delicately balanced in a land revered by all the Abrahamic faiths: Judaism, Islam and Christianity.\nThere had never been an official papal visit to the Holy Land, though Paul VI had made an informal trip there in 1964, staying only 12 hours and pointedly never referring to Israel. (John Paul, as Karol Wojtyla, the archbishop of Cracow, had visited Jerusalem in 1963.)\nJohn Paul made his long-awaited pilgrimage amid heavy security, traveling first to Mount Nebo in Jordan, where the Bible says Moses first looked out over the Promised Land, and on to Amman and the Jordan River site where Jesus is said to have been baptized.\nIn Tel Aviv, President Ezer Weizman and Prime Minister Ehud Barak received the pope as one of the most important visitors in Israel's history, and his presence in Jerusalem later was hailed by Israeli leaders as nothing less than a Christian affirmation of the Jewish right to a homeland.\nFor Palestinian leaders, his presence was also a symbolic triumph. He went to Mr. Arafat's home in Bethlehem and to a squalid Palestinian refugee camp. Mr. Arafat called his visit a ringing endorsement of Palestinian nationalist aspirations and a recognition of Palestinian suffering under Israeli rule.\nIn gestures to Israel's tiny Christian populations that were also moving personal experiences, the pope visited sites venerated as those of Jesus' birth, Last Supper, Crucifixion, burial and Resurrection. He also met the Greek Orthodox patriarch and leaders of the Maronite Christians, Armenian Catholics, Melchites and Chaldeans.\nIn Jerusalem, he saw the Ashkenazic and Sephardic chief rabbis, and went to Al Aksa Mosque to meet Sheik Ikrima Sabri, the city's chief Islamic cleric. He went to the Western Wall, Judaism's most sacred site and, following the custom of Jewish visitors, placed a note in a crevice, a plea for reconciliation that was the theme of his pilgrimage. At Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial, he paid homage to the six million victims of Nazi persecution.\nPolitics and Religion\nCloser to home, the pope often found himself at odds with Italians. Many were harshly critical of him for leading a campaign in 1981 to repeal Italy's liberal abortion law. The voters upheld abortion rights, and many resented what they called his interference. \nIn 1985, the Italian government and the Vatican signed an historic concordat disestablishing Roman Catholicism as the state religion; the pope said it showed church respect for Italy's independence, although he reserved the right to speak out on national issues. In 2002, John Paul became the first pope to visit the Italian Parliament, and used the occasion to call for the enactment of policies to encourage and support larger Italian families.\nHe was also criticized inside and outside the church for his opposition to \"liberation theology,\" a school of thought originating in Latin America but influential elsewhere, too. Blending biblical themes with Marxist and sometimes Leninist economic analyses, it was an underlying justification for the Catholic clergy's involvement in political struggles for justice for the poor in Latin America and other parts of the third world.\nFor years, John Paul tried to draw a delicate boundary between religious and political involvement, saying that concern for social justice was the rightful function of the Catholic clergy but that outright political action violated the calling of nuns and priests. Class struggle, he said, could not be the church's solution to social injustice.\nIn Latin America particularly, the clergy's resistance to the noninvolvement doctrine was strong. The Rev. Leonardo Boff of Brazil, a movement leader, was silenced by Rome for a year; in 1992 he resigned from the priesthood to protest Vatican restrictions on writings by the clergy and members of religious orders.\nAnother champion of liberation theology, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the first democratically elected president of Haiti, denounced the Vatican in 1992 for recognizing military leaders who had deposed him in 1991. Since 1982, when he became a priest, Father Aristide had excoriated the Haitian church for what he called its complicity with brutal dictatorships. He left the priesthood after being returned to power by United States forces in 1994, and was overthrown last year amid violent protests and charges of corruption.\nEven some members of the Curia, the Vatican's central administration, were disenchanted with the pope. Speaking behind cloaks of anonymity, some contended that he was a poor administrator, neglected necessary paper work, spent too much time traveling and was too much the showman. Some Vatican prelates said that in private he was somber, serious, enigmatic, sometimes quixotic, a man who hid his feelings and did not say much.\nCritics said he devoted too much attention to Poland and Eastern Europe and not enough to Western Europe early in his papacy. But his refusal to accept the Iron Curtain contributed forcefully to Communism's fall, and in later years he generally supported European political and cultural unification. He also made religious reconciliation a major concern.\nThere were grand ecumenical gestures. Besides his visit to the synagogue in Rome, he embraced the archbishop of Canterbury at Canterbury Cathedral in England in 1982 and prayed with another archbishop of Canterbury at the Vatican in 1996. In 2003, he met another Anglican archbishop, Rowan Williams, at the Vatican, and warned him against the ordination of gay priests, a matter that had deeply divided Anglicans. The Church of Rome and the Church of England studied ways to end a 450-year-old rift, but nothing came of it.\nThe pope also made overtures to Eastern Orthodoxy. In May 1999, he visited Bucharest, Romania, and prayed with Patriarch Teoctist; it was the first papal trip to a predominantly Orthodox country in nearly a thousand years. The schism that had kept Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christians apart since 1054 was not ended, but the visit was an ecumenical waymark.\nSix months later, the pope visited Georgia, in the Caucasus, another mainly Orthodox country. He was warmly greeted by President Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister who had also helped prod Communism's fall, but his reception by Georgian Orthodox Church leaders was guarded.\nOn the same trip, his last of the millennium, the pope went to India, where Christians, a tiny fraction of the population, had been the target of beatings, killings and other persecution. He met Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and other religious leaders, but won no support for his plea for toleration of his church's hope to evangelize Asia. \nHe undertook other interfaith dialogues. In 1983, he joined a Lutheran service and praised Martin Luther on the 500th birthday of the Reformation's leader. But no major agreements or ecclesiastical changes emerged from those contacts, and most theologians said John Paul, for all his good will toward other faiths, had not substantially advanced the ecumenical cause.\nFirst Slavic Pope\nHe was a poet, a playwright, the author of many books and hundreds of articles, a philosopher, a formidable debater, an actor, an athlete with a passion for skiing, swimming and mountain climbing, a professor of social ethics and a linguist fluent in seven languages and skilled in a dozen. But at the time of his election as 264th bishop of Rome, the pope was almost unknown outside the church hierarchy and his native Poland, where he had been a priest since 1946, the archbishop of Cracow since 1964 and a cardinal since 1967.\nThere had never been a Slavic pope. The last pontificate of a non-Italian - that of Adrian VI, a Dutchman from Utrecht - had ended 455 years earlier, in the era of Luther's rebellion in Germany. There had been 45 Italians on the throne of St. Peter since then.\nAfter the death of Pope Paul VI on Aug. 6, 1978, a majority of the College of Cardinals - the body that elects the pope - agreed that his successor should be an Italian but not connected with the Curia. On Aug. 26, the college elected Cardinal Albino Luciani, patriarch of Venice, who assumed the name John Paul I, combining those of his immediate predecessors, John XXIII and Paul VI, an expression of continuity he intended to preserve.\nBut John Paul I died a month later, on Sept. 28, and the cardinals returned for a new conclave starting Oct. 14. Predictions were that the successor would again be an Italian. But a rift developed among Italian cardinals, the largest national group in the college, and forced a compromise.\nConservatives had rallied to Cardinal Giuseppe Siri, archbishop of Genoa, a champion of orthodoxy and a candidate in every conclave since the death of Pius XII in 1958. Most moderates wanted Cardinal Giovanni Benelli, archbishop of Florence and an aide to Paul VI. In early balloting, neither came close to the required two-thirds plus one - 75 of 111 participants - and a search for a compromise candidate ensued.\nThe name of Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Poland was raised by Cardinal John Krol, the Polish-American archbishop of Philadelphia, and by Cardinal Franz KA\u0303\u00b6nig, archbishop of Vienna, and prelates from West Germany.\nCardinal Wojtyla was an attractive candidate, theologically orthodox yet a man of personal dynamism and proven political skills who could reach out to Eastern Europe and the peoples of Communist nations and the third world, one who could be a spokesman for peace, disarmament and justice in the world.\nHe had been a tough opponent of the Nazis, the Marxists and the Stalinists in Poland and was emerging as a bold voice within the church. He was also physically vigorous and only 58, 10 years younger than most popes elected in this century, and he could be expected to have a long pontificate.\nHis election, on the eighth ballot, met with almost universal astonishment outside the Sistine Chapel. But among Poland's 31 million Catholics, 92 percent of the population, and among millions of Americans of Polish descent, it was an occasion for pride and celebration that went on for days.\n A Personal Stamp\n \nThe new pope quickly set to work to put his stamp on the papacy. There were clues to its character in his earliest pronouncements. Addressing crowds on the night of his election, he twice invoked the name of the Virgin Mary and vowed total trust in her, a signal of doctrinal conservatism that would be a hallmark of his reign.\nHis greeting, \"Praised be Jesus Christ\" - an ancient earthy phrase used by Polish peasants and others in deeply Catholic rural areas of Europe, but one having an archaic ring in cosmopolitan Rome - was a sign that whatever lofty locutions were to come, his papacy would be rooted in his own humble origins.\nAccordingly, he put decorum aside and stripped daily life in the Vatican of many of its ceremonial frills. He eschewed the papal pronoun \"we\" in favor of \"I\" and did away with the pomp of a traditional triple-crown investiture, substituting an outdoor inaugural Mass in St. Peter's Square that was attended by 100,000 and seen on television around the world.\nIgnoring the usual papal preoccupation with the Curia's bureaucracy, he made it known that not all Vatican administrators would keep their jobs. In an early move to pre-empt opposition, he received the intransigent traditionalist French prelate, Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, who had been suspended two years earlier. The archbishop was excommunicated before he died.\nThe pope also received Andrei A. Gromyko, the Soviet foreign minister, and asserted that dialogue with the Communist nations was the \"only way to ease\" mutual problems. And he met the leaders of various world Jewish organizations and called for \"a fraternal dialogue and fruitful cooperation.\"\n \nOutdoorsman and Athlete\n \nThe new pope had been an athlete and outdoorsman all his life, a soccer player, backpacker, camper, boater and long-distance runner, and he looked it. He was solidly built and vigorous, with a bullish neck and strong, stooped shoulders that hinted of his youth as a laborer and factory worker. He moved with a deliberate, confident step, a graceful man for his size.\nHe was 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighed 175 pounds. His graying, once blondish hair was close-cropped, and his eyes were dark and deeply expressive, sometimes wide with mirth, sometimes narrowed to slits of concentration. His hands were fascinating: big, creased, workman's hands that swept the air in gestures of mildness or came together, poised to pray.\nHe did not smoke, but he liked a glass of wine with meals. He wrote many of his own speeches and other pronouncements longhand. While for some it shattered an old-fashioned papal image, he liked to chat, to joke and to laugh heartily. He loved to swim and refused to give it up, so he had a pool built at the papal summer palace at Castel Gandolfo. Word that the pope was taking daily dips caused no little stir and delighted cartoonists, who pictured him in the water with a miter on his head. When a high-ranking prelate suggested that the pool must have been expensive, the pope quipped, \"Holding another conclave to elect a new pope would cost even more.\"\n \nGlobal Journeys\n \nHe had traveled widely as a cardinal, visiting the United States in 1969 and 1976, Australia and Polynesia in 1973 and most of the countries of Europe on regular pilgrimages from Poland to Rome, and he resolved early to continue his sojourns as pope. His command of languages - including Polish, Latin, Italian, French, German, Spanish and English - was an enormous advantage, allowing him to speak directly to people nearly everywhere, from podiums and in the streets.\nIn January 1979, his first trip outside Italy as pope was to the Dominican Republic and Mexico, where millions heard him voice concern for the oppressed. He also rejected notions of Christ as a political or revolutionary figure, called the church's mission religious and not social or political, and added, \"The church wishes to stay free with regard to the competing systems.\"\nA Fateful Visit\n \nHis first papal journey to Poland, in June 1979, proved to be one of his most important trips. There was no way to know at the time, but the visit was, many historians say, the beginning of the end for Communism in the Soviet sphere - proof for all that the raw power of government could not overcome the power of faith.\nIt began just after the 900th anniversary of the martyrdom of St. Stanislaus, Poland's patron saint, and it exposed weaknesses in the Polish Communist government, which had long sought to extinguish fires of Catholicism.\nThe government first rejected a visit. Then, trying to limit the impact, it restricted his itinerary, muted advance publicity and refused to let workers take time off. But all that made no difference. From the moment he arrived and knelt to kiss the Polish earth until his tearful departure nine days later, his homecoming was a succession of thundering triumphs.\nFrom Warsaw to Auschwitz to Cracow, in 36 public appearances, he clasped old friends in headlocks, sang hymns and folk songs with his people, offered Masses for throngs that stretched across hillsides, and without directly attacking the government repeatedly challenged its authority. \"Christ cannot be kept out of the history of man in any part of the globe,\" he told vast crowds in Warsaw. \"The exclusion of Christ from the history of man is an act against man.\"\nCoal miners, housewives, university students, young people in blue jeans - 13 million people of every age and description - turned out to see him. They strewed his way with flowers, they sobbed joyously, and they broke into chants like football fans: \"We want God! We want God! We want God!\"\nIn Gniezno after an open-air Mass for 100,000 young people, the pope joined in singing popular songs. In Czestochowa, 500,000 pilgrims fell to their knees when he reconsecrated the nation to Mary, \"queen of Poland.\" At Auschwitz, where a million people, mostly Jews, had been killed by the Nazis, he spoke of this place \"built on hatred and contempt for man in the name of an insane ideology.\" Referring to a dedication in Hebrew for victims, he declared: \"It is not permissible for anyone to pass by this inscription with indifference.\"\nMonths later, the pope's role as a moral leader was reinforced by a journey to Ireland and the United States. He was eager to confront sectarian strife in Ulster, the erosion of the Irish church to secularization, and in the United States a church caught in turbulent debate over birth control, abortion, the role of women in the ministry and other issues.\nHis outdoor Mass in Dublin drew 1.2 million people. In Drogheda, near the border of Northern Ireland, he begged Catholics, Protestants and especially the militant I.R.A. to \"turn away from the path of violence.\"\nIn the United States, with 50 million Roman Catholics, he was a dramatic new figure in a world that seemed to lack outstanding leaders. Visiting six cities and rural Iowa in seven days, he captured national attention continuously, his every word and gesture televised and chronicled in the press. Vast crowds lined his routes, attended his Masses, heard his homilies and joined the spectacles. At each stop - in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Des Moines, Chicago and Washington - virtual holidays were declared, and public officials outdid each other with receptions of staggering magnitude.\nFor two whirlwind days, he dominated life in New York City. He addressed the United Nations, visited St. Patrick's Cathedral, offered Mass at Yankee Stadium and engaged in a playful dialogue with young people rallying at Madison Square Garden. He visited a church in Harlem, rode in a rain-soaked ticker-tape parade on lower Broadway and addressed crowds at Battery Park and Shea Stadium.\nHe often waded into enormous, friendly crowds, hugging and kissing people, saluting neighborhoods and church groups. At the Battery in a pouring rain, he said: \"I address a special word to the leaders of the Jewish community, whose presence here honors me greatly. Shalom! Peace be with you.\"\nThere were protests. In Washington, Sister Theresa Kane, president of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, surprised the pope in introducing him to an audience of nuns by saying, \"The church must regard the possibility of women being included in all the ministries of the church.\"\nAnd when he had gone, questions remained: Was the pope inflexible? Did he recognize deep frustrations of Catholics who disagreed with church teaching on sexual matters, the roles of women and the clergy? Was there even room for discussion?\nAssassination Attempt\n \nJohn Paul's life as a robust, traveling teacher-pope was altered on May 13, 1981, when a 23-year-old Turk, Mehmet Ali Agca, shot him as he rode in an open car before 10,000 people in St. Peter's Square. Bystanders seized the gunman as the pope's car sped away to Gemelli Hospital. Shot in the abdomen, right arm and left hand, he underwent five hours of surgery, and part of his intestine was removed.\nInvestigators searching Mr. Agca's past learned that he was a murderer who had escaped from a Turkish prison in 1979 and had ties to a neo-Nazi group, the Gray Wolves. But no evidence of a conspiracy to kill the pope was found. Mr. Agca was tried by the Italian authorities and sentenced to life in prison.\nThe assailant later said the shooting was a Soviet-inspired plot involving Bulgarian and Turkish agents, and investigators uncovered tantalizing details that seemed to support some of his assertions. But an Italian court in 1986 found the evidence ambiguous and acquitted three Bulgarians and three Turks of conspiracy in the case. A link between the attack and the Bulgarian government was often asserted, but never proved.\n The pope publicly forgave Mr. Agca, and in 1999 the Vatican endorsed clemency. In 2000, the Italian government pardoned Mr. Agca, who was extradited to Turkey and began serving a 10-year term there for the murder of a newspaper editor in 1979.\n \nThird Secret of FA\u0303\u00a1tima\n \nOn May 13, 2000, exactly 19 years after the shooting, the Vatican disclosed that a vision of the attempt on the pope's life was the so-called third secret of FA\u0303\u00a1tima, the last of three prophecies revealed to three Portuguese shepherd children by an apparition of the Virgin on May 13, 1917, at FA\u0303\u00a1tima, Portugal.\nFatima historians say the first secret prophesied the end of World War I and the coming of World War II, while the second supposedly predicted the spread and collapse of Communism and the resurgence of Christianity in Russia. The third, written and sent to Rome by one of the three recipients, Lucia de Jesus dos Santos, who became a Carmelite nun, was kept secret by five popes.\nFascination over the secret spawned conspiracy theories and doomsday cults, with conjectures ranging from a Catholic schism with rival papacies to nuclear annihilation. Devotees of apocalypse were deflated by the Vatican explanation. The pope did not comment, though he always credited the Virgin of FA\u0303\u00a1tima with sparing his life in the shooting.\nHealth Good and Bad\n \nDespite the seriousness of his wounds, the pope recovered, and in the years that followed, his old vigor returned, his health was strikingly good, and he was laid low by nothing worse than influenza until July 1992, when was hospitalized for a stomach problem. It turned out to be serious. Doctors excised a tumor the size of an orange from his colon and removed his gallbladder. The tumor was in an early stage of malignancy, but no chemotherapy or other treatment was deemed necessary, and he was traveling again within three months.\nIn November 1993, there was another flutter of concern when the pope tripped on the hem of his robe and fell as he descended three steps from his throne to greet visitors at the Vatican. He suffered a fractured and dislocated right shoulder, which had to be encased in a soft cast.\nFive months later, in April 1994, he fell as he climbed from a bathtub in his Vatican apartment, fracturing and dislocating his right thighbone. Surgeons replaced part of the bone near the hip socket with metal alloys.\nThe pope fell again in 1999 on a trip to Poland, suffering a head cut that required three stitches. By then, he had grown frail and had difficulty walking, even with a cane. There were other symptoms: trembling in his left hand and slurred speech that made it hard to understand his words. Privately, officials said he had Parkinson's disease and crippling arthritis; the Vatican did not confirm the diagnoses, but there was no doubt about them.\nBy 2002, the symptoms had profoundly worsened: he could not walk without aid, his hands shook so much he could not hold his speeches, and his speech was so slurred he was almost impossible to understand. In 2003, he traveled to Spain, Croatia, Bosnia, Poland and Slovakia, but sometimes garbled words and let aides finish his speeches.\n During his convalescences - from the shooting, the tumor operation and the falls - some Vatican officials privately expressed hope that he would be forced to settle down, travel less and get more involved in the problems of running the church. But John Paul, who hated to be coddled and sometimes brushed off aides who tried to help him, was determined to continue his busy life.\nA Traveling Papacy\n \nSix months after the 1981 shooting, he ventured to Umbria, in central Italy, and was soon planning new travels. In 1982 he visited 12 countries in Africa, Europe and South America, and by 1983 was traveling as widely as ever. Over the next few years he went back to Africa, Europe, South America, the Caribbean and the Far East, often to third-world countries, where the church was flourishing.\nWhile he went to Africa a dozen times, he refused for years to visit South Africa because of its apartheid racial policies. But after Pretoria's peaceful transition to a non-racial Democracy, he went to Johannesburg in 1995, met President Nelson Mandela and praised the reconciliation.\nIn 1986, the pope took a particularly long and exotic journey: two weeks and 30,000 miles to Bangladesh, Singapore, Fiji, New Zealand and Australia. He was greeted by women in saris dancing to the rhythms of sitars, aborigines in loincloths and painted faces, spear-toting tribesmen who rubbed noses with him, and bare-breasted Papuan women fluttering in traditional grass skirts.\nLater that year in Calcutta, where countless thousands slept in streets or mud huts, he went to Mother Teresa's hospice; four people died on the day of his visit. The pope was at a loss for words as he carried food among the wasted bodies. After nine days in India, he spoke of birth control guardedly and did not criticize India's government, which advocated contraception in the face of a growing population and widespread poverty.\nThe pope's second trip to the United States, in September 1987, included stops in Miami, Columbia, S.C., New Orleans, San Antonio, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Monterey, Calif., San Francisco and Detroit. He met the nation's 300 Catholic bishops in Los Angeles, and was asked to understand the attitudes of Americans.\nIn June 1993, he addressed for the first time what many American Catholics regarded as a crisis in the making: reports of sexual abuse of children and teen-agers committed by priests. In a letter to American bishops, he expressed sorrow for the victims and over demoralization inflicted on the church.\nHe returned to the United States in August 1993, stopping first in Jamaica and Mexico. In four days in Denver, he met President Clinton, joined 150,000 Catholics from 70 nations at a World Youth Day festival and denounced abortion and violence. But it was the enthusiasm for the pope - the chanting, roaring stuff of football games or rock concerts - that made the headlines.\nA month later, the pope made his first trip to the Baltic states, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, which had been Soviet republics from 1940 to 1991. The collapse of the Soviet yoke had exposed again the tangle of nationalistic, ethnic and religious rivalries from the Baltic to the Black Sea. And while the pope called for reconciliation, his visit seemed to underscore the harsh reality that mere good will could not resolve ancient bitter enmities.\nIn 1994, he canceled a visit to Sarajevo; Radovan Karadzic, the leader of Bosnia's Serbs, said his safety could not be guaranteed. But he took his call for an end to fratricidal war to Zagreb, Croatia. The pope in 1995 seemed ubiquitous: in Asia and Oceania in January (four million attended his outdoor Mass in Manila), in the Czech Republic and Poland in May, in Belgium in June, in Slovakia in July, in Africa in September and the United States in October.\nHis fourth journey to America, a five-day trip, took him back to New York, and for the first time to New Jersey and Maryland. As if making up for a canceled 1994 visit with an exhausting schedule, he saw Mr. Clinton, recited vespers in Newark, addressed the United Nations on its 50th anniversary and celebrated Masses at Giants Stadium in the New Jersey Meadowlands, Aqueduct Race Track in Queens, Central Park in Manhattan and Camden Yards in Baltimore.\nDespite his growing frailty - the slow step, the stooped shoulders, the persistent shaking hand - the pope, always a workaholic, continued his travels: in 1996 to Venezuela, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, Tunisia, Germany, Hungary and France; in 1997 to Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Czech Republic, Lebanon, Poland, France and Brazil, and in 1998 to Cuba, Nigeria and Austria.\nIn Cuba, with President Fidel Castro at his side, the pope appealed for human rights, urged the release of political prisoners and, without citing America's 37-year economic embargo, said such sanctions hurt the needy. Months later, Cuba freed 300 political prisoners and Mr. Clinton eased restrictions on aid, direct flights to Cuba and money sent to relatives by Cuban-Americans.\nThe pope made his fifth and last trip to the United States in January 1999. After four days in Mexico, where he challenged entrenched corruption and voiced support for the poor, he went to St. Louis, his only stop, and met briefly again with Mr. Clinton, who was facing impeachment at the time, and with Rosa Parks, 86, the heroine of the 1955 Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott. To 100,000 people, he decried the death penalty, which was favored by many American Catholics, and homelessness and the spread of gangs, drugs and sexual abuse.\nIn 1999, he went back to a liberated Poland for 13 nostalgic days. Greeted everywhere by huge, ecstatic crowds acutely aware of his place in national and world history, he prayed at the graves of his parents near Cracow, visited his hometown, Wadowice, and beatified 108 Poles killed by the Nazis. He made his final trip to his homeland in August 2003, an emotional farewell in which he asked people to pray for him.\nWhile the pope's travels were the most visible aspects of his papacy, his less spectacular pronouncements and actions were no less important and often much more controversial.\nIn 1980, he caused a stir by ordering the Rev. Robert F. Drinan, a Jesuit priest who represented a Massachusetts district in Congress, not to seek re-election. Father Drinan complied, but ambiguity clouded the episode. The pope had often called politics and the priesthood incompatible, but it was not clear why Father Drinan had been singled out. Some suggested he had been made an example because many Jesuits were involved in third-world political struggles.\nAt a Synod of Bishops in Rome that year, many Western prelates openly chafed at what they saw as the pope's inflexibility on divorce, abortion and artificial birth control. Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco cited studies showing that 76.5 percent of American Catholic women used contraceptives and that only 29 percent of American priests believed it was immoral. Other prelates argued that Catholics who used contraceptives could not be dismissed as \"obdurate, ignorant\" people. But the ripples of unrest produced no doctrinal changes.\nIndeed, stronger challenges were met with sterner measures. In 1986, the Rev. Charles E. Curran, a theologian who had dissented on birth control and other sexual questions, was stripped by the Vatican of his right to teach at the Catholic University of America after he refused to retract his views.\nOn other ethical questions, he warned of dangers he said were posed by organ transplants, genetic experiments, artificial insemination, birth and fertility controls and new drugs. On another matter, he conceded - 350 years after the fact - that the church had been wrong to persecute Galileo for saying the Earth circles the Sun, not the other way around. Seeking to rectify an infamous case of dogma over reason, the pope in 1992 said the astronomer-physicist should not have been forced in 1633, under threat of death, to recant his discoveries.\nIn 1996, the pope also acknowledged that the human body might not have been the immediate creation of God, but was the product of evolution, which he called \"more than just a hypothesis.\" The church had never condemned Darwin, but had warned that his ideas played into the hands of materialists and atheists.\nWhile confronting external church problems, John Paul also moved within by changing its hierarchy. His appointments of John J. O'Connor and his successor, Edward M. Egan, as archbishop in New York, Bernard F. Law as archbishop in Boston and Francis E. George to replace Cardinal Joseph Bernardin as archbishop in Chicago drew the liberal American church back to more conservative ground.\nHe further internationalized the Sacred College of Cardinals, which for centuries had a disproportionate number of Italians, by appointing many new cardinals from the third world. In 1994, he appointed 30 cardinals from 24 nations, bringing to 62 the number of nations represented; he appointed 22 more cardinals in 1998, 42 more in 2001 and 31 more in 2003.\nThe pope had a good relationship with the administration of President Ronald Reagan, which opened an embassy to the Holy See in 1984. But he rebuffed its claim that he backed its Central America policies, including aid to Contra rebels, who fought the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua. The pope held that Central American nations should work out their own problems. \nHis posture toward the two Bush administrations and the Clinton administration was cordial but strained by the pope's opposition to the 1991 Persian Gulf war, Mr. Clinton's support of abortion rights and the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.\nSimilarly, the pope often urged peace in the Middle East and said he looked with sympathy on Israelis and Palestinians, whose traditions, he said, \"should be granted equal respect.\" But his appeals never proposed concrete solutions to their age-old problems.\nPoland was an exception to his balanced, above-the-fray pronouncements. In 1980, he sang a Polish patriotic hymn in St. Peter's Square and vowed, \"We in Rome are united with our countrymen in Poland.\" He often voiced support for the Solidarity union while it was outlawed, calling it a model for human rights struggles.\nTo laymen who opposed autocratic regimes, the pope usually urged restraint, and to warring rebels he pleaded for a farewell to arms. In the Peruvian Andes, visiting a stronghold of the Maoist Shining Path movement, he urged the guerrillas to follow \"the roads of dialogue and not those of violence.\"\nThe pope also issued emotional appeals to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and President George Bush before the 1991 American-led attack on Iraqi forces in Kuwait. In 2003, he urged that the United Nations take the lead in countering Mr. Hussein. While papal statements often sounded antiwar, he denied that he favored a pacifist rejection of all warfare, noting that states had a right to defend themselves.\nWith the collapse of Soviet Communism, John Paul's long crusade against its political and economic tyrannies seemed to be over. But he was still troubled by what he saw as its unpalatable successors - unbridled Western capitalism and Communism returning by stealth in Eastern Europe. And he seemed to have no special perspective on the friction between Islam and the West that followed the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n \nPromising Early Life\n Spiritually, Karol Jozef Wojtyla was never far from the land of his birth. He was born on May 18, 1920, in Wadowice, 30 miles southwest of Cracow, the second of two children in a strict Roman Catholic family. His mother, Emilia Kaczorowska Wojtyla, of Lithuanian descent, died when he was 9. His father, Karol Wojtyla, was a sergeant in the Polish Army's quartermaster corps.\nYoung Karol was a good student in elementary and secondary schools, with a talent for languages and an interest in poetry, drama and literature. He also excelled in athletics, playing goalkeeper on his school soccer team, and in dramatics. He was popular with teachers and classmates, who called him Karolek (Little Charles) or Lolek.\nHis family was not well off. An old school employee recalled that \"Karolek always wore blue trousers that had clearly been cut from his father's discarded uniforms.\" When he was 18, his father, who had retired with a small pension, moved the family from Wadowice to Cracow. Karol's brother, Edmund, a doctor, died before the outbreak of World War II.\nAfter high school, Karol enrolled at Jagiellonian University in Cracow. But in 1939, the invading Nazis closed the university. His studies interrupted, he took a job in a stone quarry to help his ailing father make ends meet. Later, he found a laborer's job at the Solvay Chemical Works, where he helped organize a plant cafeteria.\nThe factory job provided him with a work card that protected him from deportation to a labor camp in German-occupied Poland. His fellow workers remembered him as already deeply religious: he could often be seen praying during rest periods.\nOutside work, he fell in with other young intellectuals and, with a friend, founded an underground drama group, the Rhapsodic Theater. Its productions were staged in homes, with Karol playing leads before small audiences of students and artists. Some early friends said that acting was his first love and that they had been surprised to see him turn to the priesthood.\nHe had a rich baritone voice and liked to sing popular songs at parties, accompanying himself on the guitar. He also wrote plays and poetry. One of his dramas, a morality play called \"The Goldsmith's Shop\" written under the pen name Andrzej Jawien, was translated into Italian and broadcast over Italian radio after the playwright became pope; it was also made into a 1987 film.\nHis father's death in 1941 deeply distressed the young man. A close friend at the time was Jan Tyranowski, a tailor and a mystic, who introduced him to the works of St. John of the Cross, a Spanish Carmelite mystical monk. Later, the future pope would write a postgraduate thesis on St. John.\nThere were reports that Karol Wojtyla was a member of the Polish resistance in World War II. Mieczyslaw Malinski, a friend who became a priest, scoffed at the accounts. He said that members of the underground had asked them both to join the fight against the Nazis, but that the two had declined. But Joseph L. Lichten, of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith in Rome, said that a Karol Wojtyla was active in a clandestine group that worked with the Christian Democratic movement Unia, which had a record of helping Jews, and that he had been put on a blacklist by the Germans.\nWhatever the case, there is no proof that the future pope did any fighting after leaving his factory job in 1942. What is known is that he studied for the priesthood clandestinely, taking underground Jagiellonian University courses and attending others at the Spiritual Seminary directed by Cracow's archbishop, Adam Stefan Sapieha, who became his patron. For the rest of the war, he lived in the basement of his patron's fortress-like palace.\nIn that period, he had two serious injuries. Knocked down by a streetcar on Tyniecka Street, he suffered a fractured skull. Later, he was almost crushed by a runaway truck, an accident that left him stoop-shouldered. \n \nPriest and Prelate\n \nHe was ordained a priest on Nov. 1, 1946. As the Communists took power in postwar Poland, Archbishop Sapieha urged his protA\u0303\u00a9gA\u0303\u00a9 to continue postgraduate studies abroad. Father Wojtyla was sent to Rome, where he enrolled at the Angelicum, a college operated by the Dominican order.\nIn two years, he earned a doctorate in philosophy, writing his dissertation on \"Problems of the Faith According to St. John of the Cross.\" After traveling in France and Belgium, he returned home and was assigned by the archbishop as assistant pastor in a village parish in Niegowic, in southern Poland.\nA year later, he was sent back to Cracow as an assistant at St. Florian's Church and to continue his theological studies. In 1953, he earned a second doctorate, in moral theology, and qualified as an instructor. He first lectured on social ethics at the Spiritual Seminary in Cracow; a year later he won a chair in social ethics at Catholic University in Lublin. It was a post he would retain until he became pope.\nHis reputation as a church intellectual grew rapidly, and in 1958 he was consecrated auxiliary bishop of Cracow under Archbishop Eugeniusz Baziak. At 38, he was the youngest member of the Polish church hierarchy. After the death of Archbishop Baziak in 1962, he was designated the acting archbishop, and on Jan. 13, 1964, Pope Paul VI made him archbishop of Cracow.\nVatican II Activist\n \nDuring Vatican II, Archbishop Wojtyla addressed council fathers in Rome on eight occasions, was instrumental in the adoption of a declaration on religious liberty and was active in committee work. In his most notable council speech, he contended that the church could not lay claim to religious liberty without conceding it to others.\n\"It is not the church's task to teach unbelievers,\" he said. He warned against moralizing and authoritarian postures, saying the church should not \"cry over the lamentable state of the world\" or pretend that it had \"all the answers to all the problems in it.\" He impressed the cardinals as a practical philosopher and drew the attention of the pope as well.\nOn June 26, 1967, Pope Paul VI elevated Archbishop Wojtyla to the College of Cardinals. At that time, Poland's Communist government regarded him as moderate and flexible, in contrast to Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski, the longtime patriarch of Warsaw, a hard-line anti-Communist.\nIn later years, that perception was reversed. While Cardinal Wyszynski remained viscerally anti-Marxist, he began cooperating with the government on nonideological social and economic programs advantageous to the church and the Polish people. Cardinal Wojtyla, meantime, became a tough, vocal and eloquent opponent of the government, demanding increased freedoms in education, mass media and human rights and preaching Christian alternatives to Marxism.\nIn 1969, Cardinal Wojtyla made his first trip to the United States, visiting Polish-American communities in 15 cities. \"Almost everywhere we went,\" said a priest who accompanied him, \"he laid aside his prepared remarks and spoke from the heart.\"\nCardinal Wojtyla returned to America in 1976, visiting 16 cities, including Cambridge, Mass., where Thomas E. Crooks, director of Harvard's summer school, recalled being \"floored by the sheer physical presence\" of the man. As Mr. Crooks remembered: \"He exuded such a combination of power and acceptance. He had this smile on his face and a look in his eye that said, 'You're wonderful. And I'm wonderful, too.' We had dinner with him later, and late that evening I told myself, 'This man ought to be pope.' \"\nLiterary Output\n \nJohn Paul's literary output was prodigious. Besides his encyclicals, he was the author of at least seven books - some bibliographies, counting his published commentaries, list as many as 11 - and more than 300 articles and essays, most of them in scholarly journals.\nIn the study of his archdiocesan residence on Franciszkanska Street in Cracow, a visitor in 1978 found 1,500 books on the shelves, including the works of ancient and modern philosophers, leaders of the church in Greek and Latin, and 20th-century avant-garde theologians, as well as volumes on many subjects in various languages. One of the few novels was \"The Shoes of the Fisherman,\" Morris West's 1963 tale of a pope from the Soviet Union.\nBooks by the future pope included \"The Foundations of Renewal,\" a 1957 work on philosophical and moral subjects; \"Love and Responsibility,\" originally lectures on sex, marriage and birth control, that was published in 1962; and \"The Acting Person,\" a 1969 phenomenological treatise. His output as pope included \"Sign of Contradiction,\" a 1979 spiritual testament, and \"The Future of the Church,\" a study of Vatican II directives, which appeared in English in 1979.\nA collection of essays, \"Crossing the Threshold of Hope,\" was published in October 1994 in 21 languages in 35 countries - in English by Alfred A. Knopf. Knopf's parent, Random House, paid a $9 million advance, and the book was on the best-seller lists in America for months. The pope donated all of the income to charity. A commercially published book by a sitting pope was unheard of in modern times. Experts say the last such publication, outside of speeches, teaching documents and other official communications, was a 1748 work on diocesan synods by Pope Benedict XIV. His last book, \"Memory and Identity,\" published this year, discussed freedom, patriotism and European integration. Last year, 25 European countries signed a constitution that does not mention the Continent's Christian roots, despite the Vatican's repeated calls that it do so.\nHe also wrote a great deal of poetry. A collection of his free verse was published by Random House in 1979 as \"Easter Vigil and Other Poems,\" and \"Roman Triptych - Meditations,\" which appeared in 2003. One poem published in Cracow under the pen name Andrzej Jawien was titled, \"The Rock.\" Written after a stroll in St. Peter's Square, it reads in translation:\nIn this place our feet meet with earth from which so many walls and columns spring.\nIf you don't get lost among them\nBut go on finding oneness and meaning,\nIt's because that very earth leads you.\nHere she not only bridges \nThe spaces of a Renaissance building\nBut also vaults interiors within ourselves\n Who grow so very conscious of our weaknesses and failures.\n It's you, Peter. You want to serve as the substratum here for those who stagger\nToward some unknown goal, to make them go where you would lead their feet\nSo that spaces can be bridged through sight that helps thought to be born.\nYou want to be the one to serve the feet, just as a rock serves the hoofs of sheep:\nThe rock is also the substratum of this gigantic temple.\nThe pasture is the cross. \n In his homeland, he also left a major monument to his faith and perseverance: the starkly modern Church of Our Lady, Queen of Poland, which rises at Nowa Huta, the new iron and steel center east of Cracow. While the authorities had long opposed the project in the Communist era, voluntary contributions were raised, and scarce building materials were scraped together. Somehow construction permits were obtained and volunteer workers took turns at the building site.\n It took more than a decade, but the project was dedicated in 1977. In a homily at the time, the future pope declared that men had a right to more than a job and a living wage.\n \"There are more profound rights of the human spirit that cannot be violated,\" he said. \"These are the rights of freedom of the human spirit, freedom of human conscience, freedom of belief and freedom of religion.\"",
