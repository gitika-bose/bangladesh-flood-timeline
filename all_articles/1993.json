[{"text": "BANGLADESH FACES DISPUTE ON FLOODS\n1993-08-01T05:00:00.000Z\nAfter a recent wave of flooding that killed about 2,000 people in South Asia, Bangladesh has renewed demands that India and Nepal control the powerful rivers that flow though their countries.\nOfficials in Bangladesh say the flooding has killed at least 150 people and displaced seven million people.\nEven though Nepal reported a death toll of more than 900 and India at least 850, political issues in all three countries are preventing efforts to find long-term solutions to the annual devastation caused by overflowing rivers.\nA senior Indian official said a long-term agreement on flood control was unlikely until Bangladesh agreed to concessions on other issues. These include, he said, the illegal flow of poor migrants into India and the assistance that he contends Bangladesh has given to Indian rebels in the northeast. But while Bangladeshi officials acknowledge that a large number of migrants are entering India, they deny that their Government helps Indian insurgents. Talks Faltered in 1970's\nAmong its proposals to limit flooding, Bangladesh wants India to persuade Nepal to build dam reservoirs on its major rivers. But an Indian official said today that efforts to resolve this issue failed in the 1970's and that there were no plans to revive them.\nAnd a leader of the governing Nepali Congress Party said a decision to build such dams would be denounced by the leftist opposition as a sellout to India. Underlining such political sensitivities in Nepal, the Government of Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala has come under fierce criticism for building a small barrage on the India-Nepal border to help regulate the flow of the Sarda River into India.\nThe death toll in Nepal is likely to rise because many of the more than 870 people reported missing may have been killed in the flooding, said Nepal's Ambassador to India, Chakra Bastola.\nThe summer monsoon rains began on June 1 and will continue until late August or early September. This year, overflowing streams and rivers have devastated a 1,300-mile-belt from Punjab to Bangladesh.\nA third of Bangladesh, a densely populated country of nearly 120 million people living on nearly 56,000 square miles, has been flooded, said Farooq Sobhan, its Ambassador to India.\n\"Every year,\" Mr. Sobhan said, \"the river beds are being raised by some two billion tons of silt coming down from the upstream rivers into Bangladesh and the Bay of Bengal. The result is more floods as the rivers rise above the level of the countryside.\"\nAmong the worst-hit of the Indian states are Assam and West Bengal, which border on Bangladesh. Assam and its neighboring northeastern states have been isolated.\nThe disputes over the waters are most significant in the dry season, especially in April, when India controls the flow of the Ganges into Bangladesh through a river barrage built in 1975.\nA 1977 agreement on water sharing that gave Bangladesh a greater water supply ended in 1982. An amended version of that treaty was extended until 1988, but since then there has been no accord despite negotiations.\nIndia draws water from the barrage and flushes it along a channel to clear silt from Calcutta port and the Hooghly River. Shifts Along Ganges Are Cited\n\"It is like a tap in the hands of the Indians: they can turn it off whenever they want,\" Ambassador Sobhan said.\nBut an Indian official who has negotiated with Bangladesh said, \"The Bangladeshis want the 1977 levels of water supply and this is just not possible any longer.\"\n\"Since that time, there has been a fall in the flow of the Ganges because of a growth of population, industrialization, diversion of waters for agriculture and irrigation.\" the official said.\nThe Bangladeshis say they are unconcerned about India's problems. Their view is that they must be assured of water during the last weeks of April, when the river is at its lowest, because it is crucial for their summer crops.\nIn the meantime, India reports that two million acres of croplands have been ruined; Bangladesh says 815,000 acres of crops have been devastated, and Nepal has set up 38 relief camps about 32,000 refugees."}, {"text": "Dhaka Donates To Flood Relief\n1993-07-21T05:00:00.000Z\nThe offers of relief continued to arrive this week in the flooded Midwest.

Two weeks of rains swelled rivers, flooding farmlands stretching east from India's Punjab region, across Nepal and into Bangladesh. By the end of last week about 4,000 people were dead and millions homeless, and millions of dollars worth of roads, railway lines and bridges were ruined.\nOfficials in India estimated that the floods may have left 1,000 people dead and as many as 15 million people homeless in that country. Air force helicopters dropped food to areas in the east, but elsewhere there seemed to be little official effort at relief.\nThe remote parts of Nepal were hit hard, but Government officials have been unable to assess how many people died or how extensive the damage has been. In Bangladesh, officials estimate flood waters have made 21 million people homeless.\nEnvironmental groups blamed the rapid deforestation of the Himalayan foothills for the severity of the flooding, saying the loss of trees quickened the rate at which waters drain into rivers."}, {"text": "Indian Monsoon Brings Floods and Landslides; Death Toll Is 500\n1993-07-23T05:00:00.000Z\nIndia's monsoon, the summer rains whose arrival is anxiously awaited by farmers, came with a vengeance this year. More than 500 people have been killed, hundreds of thousands driven from their homes and farms, and perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars in agricultural production lost.\nVast areas of the country's breadbasket, the Punjab and Harayana, have been inundated by rains and swollen rivers, and the entire northeast, lands of tea plantations and tropical forests, has been severed from the rest of the country.\nIn eastern Nepal, flash floods and landslides have caused the deaths of more than 200 people, including seven Chinese technical advisers who were working on a large irrigation project. Katmandu, the capital, was isolated by the collapse of eight bridges on the main road leading to India.\nAnd in Bangladesh, where it has been raining steadily for the last four days, lightning, landslides and flooding left at least 53 people dead in the northeast and southeast parts of the country. Government Plans Relief\nPrime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao and officials from the Punjab planned to provide relief to farmers who have seen much of their summer crop wiped out. Across several states, air force helicopters dropped relief supplies to beleaguered villagers driven from their homes to high ground.\nSo severe are the floods, that the Government, which had been predicting robust economic growth of 6 percent for the year, now says that those projections are \"unrealistic.\"\nAt the same time, genuine data on crop damage and property loss remains elusive as the Government scrambles to measure the precise extent of the catastrophe. In the past, governments have had a tendency to exaggerate the dimensions of natural disasters.\nThe Economic Times, the country's leading financial newspaper, has suggested that the relatively early arrival of annual flooding this year will have a minimal effect on the country's overall agricultural output. Indeed, the paper reported that heavy rains would in fact contribute to an increase in the winter crop, the maize and millet that will be planted when the monsoon abates and that is harvested in November.\nBy late this evening, the Press Trust of India reported that \"more than 530\" people had been killed in the last 10 days of floods, including 22 who lost their lives today. More than half of the deaths have occurred in Punjab. Helicopters Drop of Food\nIn Bihar, India's poorest state, flood waters swept through villages and hundreds of thousands of people were said to have fled their homes. Air force helicopters dropped thousands of food packets to those who took refuge on elevated railway lines and hillocks.\nAnd in Assam, in India's remote northeast, The Sentinel newspaper reported today that 2.35 million people have been forced from their homes and 250 villages have been flooded. All road and rail links to the rest of India have been cut with flood waters undermining railbeds and covering roadways in several feet of water.\nD. Pathak, the revenue secretary for the Assam state government, said that three trains with 2,500 passengers have been stranded by the floods and that army units were trying to rescue the passengers by boat. \"There is a seven-foot-high wall of water in the senior railway official's office,\" said Mr. Pathak, who spoke by phone from Dispur, the state capital.\nIndia's only rail link with Nepal, a 25-mile stretch of track between Jaynagar and Janakpur was cut when the line was submerged under five feet of water.\nThe Tribune, a paper published in Chandigarh, the capital of Punjab, where 247,000 acres are under water, attacked the Government for its continuing neglect of flood prevention projects. \"The devastation predates independence and so does the Government explanation,\" the newspaper said. \"It is all as though nothing has intervened during all these four and a half decades.\""}, {"text": "South Asia Toll: 2,100\n1993-07-25T05:00:00.000Z\nThe death toll in four weeks of flooding in South Asia has exceeded 2,100, according to the authorities, as Nepal said more than 1,100 were dead or missing, India reported 700 killed and Bangladesh cited about 300 fatalities. At least 30 of the 64 districts in Bangladesh were described as flooded.\nArticle, page 12."}, {"text": "The Power of Water\n1993-07-26T05:00:00.000Z\nRelentless rainfall continues to soak America's Midwest. Rivers are rising in some places, receding in others. But throughout the vast central watershed, the problems have barely begun.\nHomes and farms, city streets and country roads are coated with millions of tons of chocolate-colored muck, sewage and contaminating chemicals. Thousands of people have no shelter of their own. The unluckiest have been flooded out twice, even three times, in the weeks of rain. This was, and still is, the Great Flood of 1993.\nOn the grand scale of natural disasters, this may not have been the nation's worst -- and definitely is not the world's worst. Even now there are more than 2,000 dead and millions homeless from monsoon floods in India, Bangladesh and Nepal. But comparison is no comfort to the families in Iowa, Missouri and a half-dozen other states, suddenly vulnerable, overwhelmed by forces beyond human control.\nPresident Clinton said it well when he visited the flood area for the third time: \"There is almost a collective emotional process that people go through when it first hits. Folks are brave and good-humored and courageous. But then the reality of the losses sinks in, and a grief takes over.\" Reflecting that reality, last week The St. Louis Post-Dispatch offered its readers a seven-point list of steps for coping with stress.\nThe immediate relief effort has gone well. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has been on the scene since May and is, by all accounts, a model of efficiency and helpfulness. Red Cross and Salvation Army workers are everywhere -- some of them lodged at a St. Charles, Mo., motel named Noah's Ark.\nMidwesterners have responded, even in the cities, with typical rural solidarity. In Des Moines, Iowa, and Quincy, Ill., and West Alton, Mo., they have pitched in to fill sandbags -- millions of them -- and haul furniture upstairs. In a crisis, they have closed ranks, no questions asked.\nDavenport, Iowa, is under water because it didn't want a flood wall; people thought it would spoil the riverfront. Is that any reason to withhold aid? Certainly not, but let's hope the city fathers get busy building a wall against the next time. Likewise, the big percentage of farmers who failed to buy crop insurance and the even bigger percentage of homeowners without flood insurance must be helped in their distress -- and must be persuaded now to get insurance or move to higher ground.\nThe President showed proper concern when he flew most of his cabinet to a \"summit\" session downriver from St. Louis to focus on flood relief with eight governors, members of Congress from the area and local officials. He would do well to convene another session when the crisis is past, to ponder the many questions this year's flood has raised, not least the complex issues of flood control and sensible flood plain use. As the mighty rivers of the Midwest have made perfectly clear this year, their waters can be managed but they cannot be mastered.\nMeanwhile, the crisis persists. Incredibly, although the worst may be over, the rain hasn't stopped yet. And while the rivers and streams have crested in most places, they remain far above normal levels, still threatening the levees that protect farmland and the concrete flood walls in populated areas. It may be another month before all the water has drained away. It may be another lifetime before a flood like this one hits again, but now is the time to start thinking about it."}, {"text": "It's Never Fair to Just Blame the Weather\n1993-01-17T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE world still thinks of famine the way that Malthus did, as Mother Nature's revenge on hapless humanity. In fact, famine is anything but what the dour English economist called \"nature's last most dreadful resource.\" As in Somalia, it is often a man-made disaster, an avoidable economic and political catastrophe.\nThe kind of famine that struck there -- created by clan warfare, not by crop shortages or endemic poverty -- is the rule, not the exception, according to several economists who have studied famines in Africa, Asia and Europe.\nWorld food production has kept well ahead of population growth. Drought or flood do often precede famines. But declines in food production rarely account for them, says Amartya Sen, a Harvard economist whose 1981 book, \"Poverty and Famines\" (Oxford Press), changed the way many scholars analyze hunger. Typically, as thousands die, there's enough food in the country to go around or enough money to import it.\nDisaster strikes because the poorest, most downtrodden members of society suddenly can no longer afford to buy food, usually because of sudden unemployment or a surge in food prices. And, particularly since World War II, whether or not a country starves depends more on whether it has a free press and a democratic government than on whether it has enough grain, trucks or foreign aid. Death Amidst Plenty\nIn eastern and sub-Saharan Africa, for example, there has been, on average, twice as much food available per person as in other flood- or drought-prone countries that managed to avoid mass deaths.\nOne of the worst recent famines -- Bangladesh's in 1974 -- took place in a year of unusually high rice production. As Martin Ravallion, a World Bank economist who specializes in poverty in Asia, described it: Severe flooding disrupted rice planting and threw landless rural laborers out of work. Then false fears of shortages doubled rice prices in a few weeks. For the poor, who spend more than three-quarters of their wages on food, the blow was catastrophic.\nBut the famine, which was largely over even before the rice crop was harvested, was hardly inevitable.\n\"Almost everything the government did made things worse,\" said Mr. Ravallion. Bangladesh's authoritarian rulers sent the army out to \"bash hoarders,\" convincing people that it had lost control and fueling the price surge. The United States contributed by announcing that it would withhold food aid to punish Bangladesh for, of all things, selling jute to Cuba.\nBut poor countries need not starve. Famine relief has almost as long a history as famines. In the 4th century B.C., a Sanskrit book on statecraft advises: \"During famine, the king should make a store of foodstuffs and show favor to the subjects or institute the building of forts or water works.\"\nFrance and England suffered through dozens of famines in the Middle Ages. But since 1500, when they began growing enough to feed the population, their poor never starved because granaries were bare, as Malthus thought, but because they couldn't afford the grain.\nRobert Fogel, a University of Chicago economic historian and an author of \"Time on the Cross,\" a book that challenged the conventionl wisdom about the economics of slavery, has analyzed 500 years of food consumption, health and productivity in Britain and France. Even during the worst harvests, he concluded, inventories never fell below three months' worth of grain. But even a 5 percent drop in production sent prices zooming.\nKings James I and Charles I largely succeeded in averting famines between 1600 and 1640 by forcing merchants, bakers and brewers to sell their food stocks cheaply. Alas, the English civil war ended such benign intervention for the next 100 years.\nIn 1846-1851, Ireland starved in the potato famine largely because Parliament would not raise English taxes enough to save it, though it raised $60 million for the Crimean War.\nModern transportation has made it easier to move relief supplies. But far more important are the incentives governments have to save their own people. It's no accident that the familiar horror stories of the 19th and early 20th centuries occurred in one-party states, dictatorships or colonies: China, British India, Stalin's Russia.\n\"There has never been a famine in any country that's been a democracy with a relatively free press,\" said Professor Sen. \"I know of no exception. It applies to very poor countries with democratic systems as well as to rich ones.\"\nIndia, for example, has had no episodes of mass starvation since independence in 1947, despite food shortages in 1967, 1973, 1979 and 1987.\nIn western India, droughts led to surges in unemployment in 1972 and 1973. The average amount of food per capita in the area was half that in sub-Saharan Africa, but public works projects kept people from starving.\nMeanwhile, Somalia, Ethiopia and the Sudan paid heavily for the absence of democracy. Wars, corruption and government reluctance to admit problems let droughts grow into starvation.\n\"There are countries that are not democratic and don't have famines -- Latin America, for example.\" said Professor Sen. \"My point really is that if famine is about to develop, democracy can guarantee that it won't. When newspapers are controlled, it's amazing how ignorant and immune from pressure the government can be.\"\nIn Mao's China, up to 30 million may have starved during the Great Leap Forward. The government confiscated millions of villagers' family plots to gather them into collective farms, assuming the owners would keep working out of loyalty to socialist ideals. Output plummeted.\nBut Beijing did nothing, partially because it did not realize the program had failed; it actually increased the amounts that rural areas were required to send to cities. By 1960, as the famine was coming to a peak, the authorities thought they had 100 million more metric tons of grain than they did.\n\"In the process of deluding the world,\" said Professor Sen, \"you delude yourself.\"\nBut even with the world alerted, handing out foreign grain isn't the best solution.\n\"It's just as important what happens to domestic markets and relative incomes as how effectively the army can deliver food to people,\" said Mr. Ravallion. \"The indigenous institutions can do it much better.\"\nGiving out make-work jobs, as India has often done, can help the poor buy grain and rebuild the roads and bridges for food trucks. Getting them back to their farms can help them grow it. Even announcing that shipments are on the way can drive the price down so they can afford it.\nHistory suggests that America's mercy mission won't solve Somalia's starvation problem. Stable governments let farmers grow and democracy helps protect the poor.\n\"One hopes,\" said Mr. Ravallion, \"that just by providing the framework -- peace -- a credible government will evolve. The people of Somalia have to do it. The U.S. Army can't.\""}, {"text": "Rebellion Flares Anew in Northeast of India\n1993-07-22T05:00:00.000Z\nWhen guerrillas ambushed a military convoy in the Northeast of India recently, killing more than 25 soldiers, they signaled a resurgence of their 40-year campaign for independence.\nAfter decades of guerrilla war by a dozen ethnic-based insurgencies that has left thousands dead and tied down an estimated 40,000 troops in the Northeast, officials say the rebels are widening their activities, extorting money from businessmen in major towns, and kidnapping and killing officials.\nThe remote Northeast, roughly the size of Montana, Wyoming and Colorado and rich in minerals, is home to about 25 million people and encompasses seven states. They border Myanmar, Tibet, Bhutan and Bangladesh.\nThe insurgencies are rooted in ethnic, economic and religious factors that separate the Northeast from predominantly Hindu India, especially its politically powerful northern belt. The latest ambush took place in Manipur State, and officials blamed the National Socialist Council for Nagaland, the most powerful of the rebel groups. No group has taken responsibility for the attack.\nMany Nagas are Christians, largely Baptists, who were converted more than 100 years ago by American missionaries. Other religious groups in the region include Presbyterians in Mizoram and Meghalaya states, and Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims in Manipur, Assam and Tripura states.\n\"India must face this reality: that the spirit of our people cannot be crushed by brute force or by flooding us with money,\" said Tubu Kevichusa, a lawyer from Nagaland who left India in the 1980's to work with the separatist Federal Government of Nagaland, based in Myanmar. He spoke to a reporter after returning to India.\nThe central Government in New Delhi has pumped money into the Northeast to build roads and state-run industries and help finance the strapped states, but it continues to be seen as an adversary in many parts.\nSome Indians say the only solution to the insurgencies is greater political and economic autonomy for all 25 states in India.\nIn Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland, as well in Assam, officials and human-rights advocates say there have been widespread human rights violations by troops and insurgents.\nSome soldiers have been formally charged with rape, murder, destruction of churches, theft and torture, and many more have been accused of such crimes.\nThe largest state in the region is Assam, which, with a population of 22 million, is dominated by Assamese-speaking Hindus. There are smaller communities of indigenous peoples speaking other languages who want to carve separate states out of Assam. But the main Assamese rivalry has been between Hindus and Bengali-speaking Muslim settlers from Bangladesh.\n\"Many of these people have settled illegally here,\" said Dhiremn Bezbaruah, a newspaper editor. \"They are still coming in and posing a threat to our culture and identity.\"\nBut Parag Das, a prominent Hindu editor who has been arrested twice for supporting the insurgents, said, \"In many ways, we remain a colony, exploited and abused.\""}, {"text": "NEWS SUMMARY\n1993-07-25T05:00:00.000Z\nInternational 3-13 RUSSIA TO REIN IN MONEY SUPPLY\nRussia's Central Bank plans to withdraw all bank notes issued before 1993 in an apparent move to reassert control over the money supply. 1 IS CHINA'S LEADER HEALTHY?

During his 11-year tenure, its budget and staff nearly quadrupled.\nIn 1960, saying half the world's population was malnourished, he announced a Freedom from Hunger campaign. \"Hunger is neither inevitable nor irremediable,\" he said. \"It is within our power to bring this old affliction under control.\"\nThe program did not immediately catch on, but eventually won United Nations endorsement.\nHe gathered delegates from more than 100 countries for the World Food Congress in 1963. They signed a unanimous declaration for the human right of freedom from hunger, and outlined a program to achieve it.\nHe dealt with thorny issues of agricultural technology, population control, financing, economic development and international aid. Born in East Bengal\nMr. Sen was born in East Bengal, now Bangladesh. After graduating from Calcutta and Oxford Universities, he joined the Indian civil service in 1922, under British rule.\nWhen India gained independence in 1947, he was named Ambassador to Washington and over the years also served as Ambassador to Japan, Mexico, Italy and Yugoslavia.\nHe promoted India's policy of friendship with the United States. He sought aid for development and support of India's fledgling democracy, while also delicately steering a course of nonalignment in the cold war.\nHis first wife died. He is survived by his second wife of 62 years, the former Chiroprova Chatterjee; four daughters, Krishna Kopell of Stanford, Calif., Urmila Olay of Madrid, and Aruna Roy and Nandini Sen, both of New Dehli; six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren."}, {"text": "CARTER ANNOUNCES VACCINATION PLAN\n1993-03-13T05:00:00.000Z\nFormer President Jimmy Carter today undertook a campaign to immunize thousands of preschool children here within the next six weeks.\nMr. Carter said at a news conference that volunteers from the Atlanta Project, the program he created a year and a half ago to attack virtually every poverty-related problem of the inner city, would flood into 20 impoverished neighborhoods on the weekend of April 17-18 in an effort to visit more than 200,000 families whose children may need vaccinations against a variety of illnesses, including polio, measles, mumps, whooping cough and rubella.\n\"This is a third-world country as far as the attention we give our own children,\" Mr. Carter said. \"We have a much higher immunization rate in Bangladesh than we do in Atlanta. And this means that in this whole country among African-Americans, we have an infant mortality rate of 18 per 1,000 babies born. There are a lot of third-world countries that have lower infant mortality rates than we do among our African-American neighbors.\" Michael Jackson Lends Support\nAppearing at the news conference by satellite broadcast from Los Angeles, the pop singer Michael Jackson promised to come to Atlanta for an unspecified \"event\" -- probably not a full-scale concert -- to reward participants in the immunization program.\nOfficials of the Atlanta Project said there were about 55,000 preschool children in the low-income neighborhoods that the project serves. But because Georgia, like most states, requires children to be vaccinated before entering school, about 97 percent of 5-year-olds are already immunized.\nSo the program's target will be these neighborhoods' 20,000 or so children under the age of 2. Dr. David M. Allen, health director of the Atlanta Project, said that more than half of these children had probably not been immunized but that he did not know how many of them the program would be able to reach.\nThe immunization program has a budget of $450,000; the vaccines are being provided without charge by the city and county governments.\nThe program is planned for two phases. On the first weekend, April 17-18, the volunteers will try to identify the children who have not been immunized. The program will set up vaccination sites the next weekend. ."}, {"text": "NEWS SUMMARY\n1993-08-13T05:00:00.000Z\nInternational A2-9 TATARS RECLAIMING HERITAGE The Tatars of Russia lost their empire when Ivan the Terrible captured Kazan.

Largely as a result, renewable resources will become increasingly scarce. The total area of rich agricultural land will shrink, and many remaining virgin forests will be lost. Overuse and pollution of aquifers, rivers and other water supplies will continue, and the thinning of the ozone layer will probably worsen.\nFor several decades, some economists and environmental experts like Robert Heilbroner, Paul Ehrlich and Jessica Tuckman Mathews have warned that such scarcities could spark violent civil or international conflict. But debate has been limited by lack of carefully compiled evidence. So the Project on Environmental Change and Acute Conflict, a research group sponsored by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the University of Toronto, brought together a team of 30 researchers from four continents to examine case studies.\nThe evidence they gathered is disturbing: scarcities of renewable resources are already contributing to dislocations and violent conflicts in many parts of the third world. Moreover, these conflicts may foreshadow more violence in coming decades, particularly in poor countries where shortages of water, forests and fertile land are already producing terrible hardship.\nThe project's research showed that land scarcity in Bangladesh, produced in part by rapid population growth, has caused millions of people to migrate to India. This has led to brutal ethnic conflicts in the Indian states of Assam and Tripura.\nEnvironmental damage costs China at least 15 percent of its gross national product. This burden is getting worse, mainly because of reduced crop yields due to water, soil and air pollution, high levels of human illness from air pollution, the loss of farm land due to construction and erosion, and flooding and soil-nutrient loss caused by erosion and deforestation. Combined with continued population growth, the Chinese Government will be less able to manage the country's affairs, impeding reforms and raising the chance of social disintegration. We can also expect domestic strife because huge numbers of people will move from China's ecologically devastated interior to its booming coastal zones.\nIn the Philippines, a persistent insurgency is given extra impetus by the desperate poverty arising from degraded forests and soils in hilly areas of the interior. \nIn the Middle East, severe shortages of ground water in the Jordan River basin reinforce the unequal distribution of water between Israelis and Palestinians. This hurts Palestinian farming and deepens the economic crisis for West Bank Arabs, problems that could hinder the peace talks.\nIn South Africa, apartheid concentrated millions of blacks in some of the country's most ecologically sensitive territories. Wide swaths of these homelands have been stripped of trees for fuel and grazed down to bare dirt. The top soil has eroded. This contributes to migration to cities and to the rapid growth of urban squatter settlements that are rife with violence.\nExpanding population, land degradation and drought in Senegal and Mauritania helped spur a violent conflict over irrigable land in the Senegal River basin, resulting in tens of thousands of refugees.\nSimilar factors stimulated the growth of the Maoist Shining Path insurgency in the southern highlands of Peru. In Haiti, the irreversible clear-cutting of forests and loss of soil worsens the economic crisis and violent social strife, which in turn have caused an exodus of boat people.\nSkeptics sometimes argue that conflict arising from scarcity has been common throughout history and is therefore not worthy of new study or initiatives.\nBut shortages of renewable resources in the next 50 years will probably occur with a speed, complexity and magnitude unprecedented in history. Whole countries can now be deforested in a few decades, most of a region's topsoil can disappear in a generation and acute depletion of the ozone layer may take only 20 years.\nMoreover, unlike nonrenewables -- including fossil fuels and iron ore -- renewable resources are linked in highly complex systems. The overuse of water, soil or forests can lead to many unforeseen, simultaneous environmental crises. When a hillside is deforested, it disturbs the water cycle between the land and atmosphere while erosion produces silt that can plug irrigation works and ruin coastal fisheries.\nThe evidence gathered by our project also suggests that future violence influenced by scarcities will not follow traditional patterns. In the past, wars over natural resources have often been over nonrenewable ones -- such as Japan's quest for oil and minerals in China and Southeast Asia before World War II. Today, by contrast, many threatened renewable resources -- the atmosphere and the oceans -- are held in common. This makes it unlikely that they will be the object of straightforward clashes between nations.\nAlso, we now understand that scarcities often produce insidious and cumulative social effects, such as large migrations and economic disruption. This can lead to ethnic strife, civil war and insurgency -- subnational conflicts that usually attract little attention in the industrialized world but can seriously affect the security interests of rich and poor countries alike.\nIt is true that technological, political and economic innovations often allow societies to adapt to environmental change. But this should not distract our attention from how scarcity can set the stage for conflict.\nWhat can be done to ease these pressures? While circumstances differ across the third world, in general poor countries must act to control population growth, distribute land and wealth more equitably, and encourage ecologically sustainable economic growth.\nRich countries need to reduce the debt burden on poor nations and assist, through aid and sharing technology, environmentally sound industrialization. Under pressure from banks and international lending agencies to pay their external debts, poor countries often use their best land to grow export crops. This displaces many people to increasingly unmanageable cities and ecologically vulnerable areas like steep hillsides. Ideally, land reform coupled with labor-intensive industries would boost rural incomes and help stem the population flow.\nWithout aggressive action to address rising scarcities of renewable resources in poor countries, there will be ever more conflicts. Scholars, policy analysts and the new Administration would be wise to take heed."}, {"text": "Foreign Maids in Kuwait Fleeing by the Hundreds\n1993-02-24T05:00:00.000Z\nWhite buses, the windows covered by wire mesh, roll nightly into the Administrative Deportation Center at Dasma, a set of low white-brick buildings in the center of Kuwait City. Dozens of Filipino and Sri Lankan women step off.\nThe women, who often wait six hours in a chilly alley before they are attended, are some of the hundreds of maids who have fled their Kuwaiti employers to take refuge in their embassies because of what they say are intolerable working conditions.\nBused in from the embassies where they have sought refuge, the women must settle their disputes with their employers in order to leave the country or find new jobs.\n\"His wife beat me,\" Farida Abdel Hamid, a 25-year-old maid from Sri Lanka, told a deportation official at the center. \"And he has not paid me for nine months.\"\n\"Not true, not true,\" said her employer, Ali Alaptar. \"She has run away three times now and is nothing but trouble. We don't want her back.\" Few Are Convicted\nThe encounter between the woman and her former employer was part of an effort by the Kuwaiti Government to tackle one of the country's most serious and embarrassing problems.\nAfter playing down the level of abuse a year ago, the Government later flew back home 850 of some 2,000 Philippine women who had fled their employers. In the last few months, deportation officials have begun to call in employers charged with abuse.\nIn rare cases, when Kuwaiti officials are unable to mediate their disputes, foreign workers take their complaints to court. But there have been few, if any, convictions of Kuwaitis, who appear to settle with their accusers before a sentence is delivered.\n\"Kuwaitis, especially those who remained here during the Iraqi occupation, have become more aggressive,\" said Mohammed Mishair Al-Khobeizi, the director of the deportation center. \"Tempers are more volatile and people are more prone to being abusive.\"\nAsian diplomats say the number of fleeing women, despite new efforts by the Government, continues to run to several dozen a week and is stretching their staff and facilities to the breaking point. They have appealed to the Kuwaiti Government to intervene, to set up a center for the runaways, amend the labor law to protect domestic help and force employers to pay the agreed upon salaries on time. Problem 'Out of Control'\n\"The problem is out of control,\" an Asian ambassador said. \"There is no sign that things are improving. We just cannot cope with the numbers flooding into our doors. We have no budget to feed and clothe the women. And we cannot cope with the hundreds of cases we see.\"\nThe Philippine Embassy is currently sheltering about 300 women. The women are cooped up in two rooms in a house next to the embassy where they have just enough space to lie down and sleep. They share three bathrooms and pool their money to buy food.\nThe embassies of Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and India, each of which harbors a few dozen women, get 15 to 20 new arrivals a day. The embassies have run out of room, forcing the foreign workers, often with few resources, to find accommodations with friends or return to their employers.\nAmong the 500,000 foreign workers in Kuwait about 100,000 are domestic servants, mainly from India, Sri Lanka and the Philippines. Most are young Asian women who cook meals, clean and look after the children for a population that has one of the highest standards of living in the world.\nThe working conditions and salary levels are not regulated by the state. Most maids earn about $165 a month; the minimum wage for Kuwaitis is $510 a month. The Servants' Complaints\nThe domestic servants who show up at the embassies frequently complain of not being given a day off, of working 12 or 15 hours a day and of not being paid on time. Many complain of beatings, of being locked in their rooms and refused permission to go outside the home. Some say they have been raped.\nAbdul Ahoor Umma, a 21-year-old Sri Lankan, said she was raped by her employer in December, a month after arriving in Kuwait. She was eventually handed back to the agent who brought her into the country.\n\"The agent kept me in a locked room and repeatedly raped me,\" she said.\nThe agent then sent her to a new employer, who she said also raped her.\nOutraged by the case, Sri Lankan diplomats have taken the unusual step of bringing the case to court while giving Ms. Umma asylum in the embassy. Most rape charges by guest workers are settled outside the legal system.\n\"This case just went too far,\" a Sri Lankan diplomat said. Unscrupulous Tactics\nMany of the women who come to Kuwait make financial sacrifices to find work as maids.\nThey pay about $500 to recruitment agencies in their home countries, a fee that often requires their families to sell animals or pawn possessions. Most of the women are mothers who say they endure the two or three years of separation from their families so they can send back money for their children.\nThe recruiters are regularly charged with unscrupulous tactics. The women contend that they are often told they will receive jobs in Bahrain or the United Arab Emirates, when in fact they are destined for Kuwait. The agencies also often promise salaries that are higher than those paid.\n\"I was told I had a job as a saleslady,\" said 24-year-old Gloria Adducul, who fled to the Philippine Embassy, she said, after being beaten by her employer. \"But when I got to Kuwait they told me I would work as a maid and would receive $120 a month, not the $500 a month I had been promised. What could I do? I had paid my money and I had no way to get home.\"\nIf the maids want to leave Kuwait before their contracts expire, their employers can demand the return of the $1,500 fee they paid to the recruitment agencies.\nWomen who find new employers can get them to pay this fee and obtain their release from their old employers. But those who want to leave the country must often appeal to their own families to send them money to free them from their bond. To insure that the women who have fled to the embassies do not slip out of the country without paying the $1,500, most employers in Kuwait retain their servants' passports. Charges Not New\nThe charges of mistreatment by the Asian laborers are not new, either in Kuwait or in other Persian Gulf countries, like Saudi Arabia.\nIn 1988 the Philippine Government banned women from coming to Kuwait to work as domestics, exempting only those who obtained jobs with members of the royal family and diplomats.\nBut Kuwait's decision to open its society after the Persian Gulf war, a decision that stands in stark contrast with Saudi Arabia, has brought the problem into the open. The Kuwaiti press, freed from censorship, reports charges of abuse made by Asian workers against Kuwaiti employers. And the Government has permitted two United States human rights groups to document the problem.\nAsian diplomats say the Government has begun to show more interest in solving the problem.\n\"At least there is a forum now in which we can discuss the issue,\" an ambassador said, \"and this is a big improvement from the days when we could not talk about it.\""}, {"text": "If Trade Pact Fails, Doubt On Japan Role in Mexico\n1993-11-04T05:00:00.000Z\nContradicting what has become a central argument for the North American Free Trade Agreement, businessmen, diplomats and trade experts say Japan and Europe are unlikely to flood Mexico with new investment and trade if the pact is not approved.\nWith the prospect for Congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement in doubt, both President Clinton and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari have warned that Japan and other American rivals would seize whatever economic opportunities the United States might pass up in Mexico.\nTrade experts and businessmen here, however, say Mexico is likely to prove more attractive to many potential Asian and European investors with the trade accord than without it.\nMoreover, given Mexico's economic difficulties and its dependence on American capital and commerce, many economists and Government officials also say it simply could not afford to turn away from the United States, even if the trade pact fails. 'Afraid of Japan'\n\"This has touched a chord in the United States because people are afraid of Japan, but it is not an alternative as such,\" said a senior Mexican official who supports the accord and spoke on the condition that he not be identified. \"Japan will be interested in Mexico. The same goes for Europe. But it would be naive to think that Japan is poised to jump in.\"\nIn Tokyo, Japanese officials and business people echoed the view that Mexico is unlikely to loom any larger in their thinking without the North American accord. Total Japanese investment in Mexico last year, they noted, was $60 million, roughly what Japan invested in Bangladesh and barely 3 percent of what the United States invested in Mexico over the same period.\n\"I don't think that a discussion about a free trade agreement between Japan and Mexico has ever taken place here,\" said Masakazu Toyoda, the director of the Americas division of Japan's Ministry for International Trade and Industry, known as MITI. \"It is an interesting idea, but I don't think it works.\"\nOther Japanese officials expressed irritation or amusement that Mr. Clinton seemed to be invoking Japan to scare Americans. \"He's joking, right?\" a senior Government politician asked. \"Japan and Mexico? Does that sound like a big alliance?\" Warning to Congress\nOn Monday Mr. Clinton warned that if American legislators vote later this month to reject Nafta, as the accord is known, the Japanese would swarm over Mexico \"like flies on a June bug.\"\nMexican officials have indeed quickened their efforts to find new economic partnerships in Europe, Asia and Latin America in case the agreement is killed. But similar efforts in recent years have been less than successful.\nSince taking office in December 1988, Mr. Salinas has courted Asian investment and trade. He has encountered skepticism, however, much of it tied to memories of the huge losses of Japanese banks during Mexico's foreign debt crisis of the 1980's.\nIn fact, Mexican officials recall that Mr. Salinas turned to the idea of the pact, after initially rejecting it, in part because of difficulties in getting European and Asian investors to come into Mexico.\nSome Japanese officials have spoken positively of the trade deal, suggesting that by improving the investment climate in Mexico it would work to the benefit of Japanese investors who might want to use Mexico and Canada as a base for producing products to be exported to the United States. Other Partners Sought\nThroughout its trade talks with Canada and the United States, Mexico has continued to work to diversify the foreign partners for its investment and trade.\nUntil it became clear this summer that the accord was in serious trouble in the American Congress, however, Mexican officials said they saw little reason to risk antagonizing the United States by wooing America's economic competitors more aggressively.\nLast year, for example, Mexican trade with European Community nations was $10.3 billion, accounting for 11.5 percent of Mexico's imports and 7.2 percent of its exports, according to Mexican figures.\nMexico's trade with Japan amounted to $3.2 billion, or less than 5 percent of the national total. But with a drop in the value of Mexico's oil sales, its trade deficit with Japan skyrocketed from $542 million in 1991 to $2.2 billion last year.\nBy comparison, Mexico's imports from the United States alone were $24.6 billion, or 62.8 percent of the country's purchases from abroad, while the United States accounted for 68 percent of Mexican exports, or $18.7 billion. Lifting of Curbs Seen\nIf the deal is rejected, senior Mexican officials say they will probably revise the country's foreign investment law in order to extend to all foreign investors some of the benefits that would go only to Americans and Canadians under the North American accord.\nThey said restrictions on foreign participation in banking, insurance and other financial services were almost certain to be loosened. Mexico is also contemplating signing investment-protection agreements with European countries in order to guarantee their businessmen special terms, they said.\nMexico's Trade Secretary, Jaime Serra Puche, said in an interview, \"It is conceivable that in the absence of Nafta, we would go ahead and negotiate trade agreements with the European Community and Japan.\"\nMexican officials acknowledged that a tariff-reduction agreement with European Community nations would be difficult to reach because it would have to be negotiated with the community as a whole. They predicted that such a deal might be more possible with Japan, but a parade of Japanese officials contradicted them. Criticism From Abroad\nLike some Caribbean and Central American nations, smaller Asian countries have opposed the North American agreement out of concern that it might divert investment away from them. The central criticism that European and Japanese officials have made of the pact, however, is that it would discriminate against businesses outside North America by setting high \"rules of origin.\"\nAs tariff barriers are gradually eliminated among the United States, Canada and Mexico, most goods would only be able to move freely through the zone if they were made mostly from North American materials. In two areas where Asian manufacturers might be especially anxious to invest, the automotive and textile industries, this so-called content requirement is even stiffer.\nIn a speech to Mexican businessmen late last month, a former Japanese Goverment trade official for North America, Yasuo Tanabe, complained that the trade accord showed evidence of \"sneaking protectionism.\" But in a later interview with the Mexican newspaper El Financiero, Mr. Tanabe added that independently of the pact, \"There's no Mexican boom among Japanese business society.\"\nTrade experts and businessmen in Mexico gave a similar view: the fact that some non-American companies might be dissuaded from investing in Mexico with the accord in place does not mean those companies will invest without it.\nFor many larger Japanese and European firms, cheap labor would not now compensate for the other costs of moving manufacturing operations to Mexico. But several businessmen said the trade accord might improve that equation considerably for many of those companies, particularly big multinationals that have established North American regional operations. With the pact, they said Mexico could offer duty-free entrance into Canada and the United States, greater economic stability, and expected improvements in areas like transportation and communications.\n\"If the Japanese trading companies had identified any opportunities in Mexico, they would be pursuing them now,\" said Gabriel Szekely, a professor of international relations at the University of California at San Diego who is a leading expert on Mexico's economic relations with Asia.\n\"Mexico will become truly important to the Japanese and the Asians to the extent that it finally joins the North American economy,\" Dr. Szekely added. \"Without Nafta, that won't happen.\""}, {"text": "Conversations: Khaleda Zia; A Woman Leader for a Land That Defies Islamic Stereotypes\n1993-10-17T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE ministers and minions circling Bangladesh's Prime Minister, Khaleda Zia, on a visit to New York this month boasted that she was the first Islamic woman to address the United Nations General Assembly as an elected head of government. The Prime Minister was less impressed by the distinction.\n\"Hmmm,\" was all the reply she could muster when asked about it in her New York hotel suite. Born in an Asian Islamic milieu, not a Middle Eastern one, Mrs. Zia was more eager to make the point that while Bangladeshi women still suffer great privations, as do most South Asian women, there is no longer anything unusual about women in Bangladesh taking part in public life.\nIn Bangladesh, a Muslim-majority country largely without the chador or the system of purdah that keeps women secluded, both the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition, Sheik Hasina Wazed, are women, as are at least 10 percent of the members of Parliament.\n\"We allow and encourage women to participate in all fields of national life,\" said Prime Minister Zia, 48, clad in a cream silk sari. \"In the villages, women work in the fields. And in the towns also, women work outside their homes. Women are taking part in cultural activities and politics; they are working in the offices and in government departments, and as doctors and teachers.\"\nPrime Minister Zia, the widow of President Ziaur Rahman, an army general who was assassinated in 1981, has surprised Bangladeshis, first by casting aside a demure first-lady image to join civilian politicians in a tough, nine-year street campaign for democracy. The movement finally toppled Lieut. Gen. H. M. Ershad in late 1990. Then, demonstrating unexpected political strength, she led her husband's Bangladesh Nationalist Party to a decisive victory in the elections that followed early in 1991.\nNow as Prime Minister, Mrs. Zia -- in contrast with Benazir Bhutto when she first became Prime Minister of Pakistan -- is aggressively promoting education and vocational training, especially of girls, and expanding small-scale, no-collateral lending to increase the self-sufficiency of women. The task is enormous. When she took office, according to the United Nations Development Program, the average Bangladeshi was getting about two years of formal schooling -- and only a third of schoolchildren were girls. Fewer than half of Bangladesh's 120 million people are literate; fewer than a third of the women can read. Educational Experiments\n\"Our primary education is now free and compulsory up to grade five -- and for girls free up to grade eight,\" she said. \"We are experimenting in some areas with a scheme that gives food grains to families who keep their children in school.\n\"Sometimes, a parent will bring a bright girl to me who is too poor to continue her studies,\" said the Prime Minister, the mother of two university-aged sons. \"I have a discretionary fund for such girls.\"\nPrime Minister Zia has benefitted from the help of strong Bangladeshi nongovernmental development organizations, which even in the Ershad years managed to steer clear of the pervasive official corruption that weakened or paralyzed government aid projects.\nAlthough a militant Islamic fringe tries to curb the public role of women, Prime Minister Zia, the daughter of a provincial businessman and a prominent social worker, is confident that Bangladeshis will reject the fundamentalist message. Her critics say she could do more to ostracize Islamic militants, some of whom became her political allies in 1991.\n\"We are religious people, certainly,\" Mrs. Zia said. \"But we are not extremists or fanatics, and therefore we are more liberal, and we consider that our women are more free. We have women who are very famous singers, and women who take part in drama on the stage and in the cinema.\"\nA lot of this has to do with the culture of Bengal, a lush part of the Indian Subcontinent where the harsh plains of the north and west dissolve into emerald rice fields laced with waterways and shaded by palms. Both Calcutta, in eastern India, and Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, are centers of commerce and intellectual life.\nWhen Bengal was split along Hindu-Muslim lines in 1947, what is now Bangladesh became a distant part of Islamic Pakistan. In 1971, putting Bengali nationalism ahead of religion, Bangladeshis opted for a precarious independence instead, and slid rapidly into hopeless underdevelopment.\nNow, less than a quarter-century later, the country has begun to turn around, international development organizations say. At the World Bank, nobody calls Bangladesh a basket case any more. Although it still ranks among the least developed nations -- and is vulnerable to horrifying natural disasters -- the country outpaces much of Africa and a few Asian nations in certain measures of improved quality of life, according to the United Nations Development Program. Birth Rate Down\nA population growth rate that was approaching 3 percent has been cut to less than 2.4 percent -- lower than the average rates in Central America, Africa and the Middle East, though still triple the North American rate. Three-quarters of Bangladeshis now have access to some kind of basic medical care, a higher rate than in India. And women's health cooperatives have helped bring most of the babies within reach of vaccines.\nPopulation experts are stunned at this Muslim society's acceptance of family planning, including some abortion and sterilization.\n\"It is a wrong conception that Islam is against family planning,\" Mrs. Zia said. \"That may be true of the Catholics, but not Muslims. There is nothing in Islam that accepts that convention. Certainly in Bangladesh we do not have that constraint. Family planning is widespread and has been accepted in every corner of the country. Women and men are aware of its importance, and they are practicing it. That is why our birth rate has come down.\"\nPrime Minister Zia, who was married at the age of 15 and learned much of what she knows of the world from her travels with her late husband when he was army chief, has a policy of taking young Bangladeshis abroad on official trips to \"give the bright ones international exposure,\" she said. With her in New York as part of Bangladesh's United Nations delegation were a teenage girl and boy who had scored the highest marks in their Dhaka schools.\nThe Prime Minister said she has felt no resistance from men who have to deal with her as Bangladesh's leader. Her relations with the unpredictable army are good because of her husband's long military service and sympathy over his death at the hands of dissident officers.\nBut like other South Asian women who have held high office -- Indira Gandhi, Ms. Bhutto and Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka -- both she and Sheik Hasina, the daughter of Sheik Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's founding father, are the inheritors of the legacies of male relatives. Nonetheless, Mrs. Zia says women now stand on their own political feet in Bangladesh.\n\"From my experience, voters do not see any difference between men and women,\" she said. \"They judge candidates for what they say. It is possible for women to come up in politics in Bangladesh now without any family connections. In this we are equal.\""}, {"text": "Doctors Say a New Cholera Poses a Worldwide Danger\n1993-08-13T05:00:00.000Z\nA new strain of cholera sweeping across India and Bangladesh at an alarming rate has spread to Thailand and threatens to cause a global epidemic of the diarrheal illness, health officials and other experts reported yesterday. Cholera is spread primarily through contaminated water and poor sanitation.\nIn the United States, one non-fatal case of the new cholera has been reported, in Los Angeles, in a woman who became infected in India. The new strain is not seen as a major public health problem in the United States, where only rare cases of the older strains of cholera have been reported in recent years, though epidemics occurred in the last century.\nBut the World Health Organization in Geneva and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta say the new development is ominous for much of the world, and C.D.C. officials say they are not discounting the possibility that cases might occur in the United States in areas where sanitation is poor. Detection Is Difficult\nThe new strain first came to light less than a year ago in India. Since it cannot be detected by standard laboratory techniques, cases can easily be missed, say the authors of a study in the Aug. 14 issue of The Lancet, a leading medical journal. To improve diagnoses, the World Health Organization is sending special testing materials to many countries.\nAnother reason for concern is that earlier attacks from the older strains leave no lasting immunity to the new one.\nThe experts said the reports were intended to warn health officials in Asia, Africa and Latin America of the need to keep up their guard to prevent a possible health catastrophe. They said widespread adherence to current recommendations should contain the epidemic.\n\"Since we cannot predict where or how rapidly this new organism will spread, countries must stay prepared indefinitely by maintaining surveillance, by assuring access to treatment and by providing clean water and adequate sewage disposal,\" Dr. David L. Swerdlow and Dr. Allen A. Ries, of the Centers for Disease Control, wrote in The Lancet. The Need for a Vaccine\nThe new development also underscores the need for an effective vaccine. W.H.O. and the United States Public Health Service do not recommend currently marketed cholera vaccines because they protect only a small percentage of individuals and only for a brief period of time. Current vaccines are ineffective against the new strain.\nCholera is caused by a bacterium, Vibrio cholerae, that produces a toxin that causes severe diarrhea. The new strain, called O139 because 138 other strains are known, differs in its microbiological characteristics from the others but causes an illness that is indistinguishable, the experts said.\nIn its severe form, cholera can cause watery diarrhea, vomiting and muscle cramps. The sudden loss of huge volumes of fluid and chemicals causes a collapse of the vascular system and death within hours unless the fluids and chemicals are replaced orally or intravenously. Such therapy can tame a killer disease, reducing the death rate from 50 percent to less than 1 percent.\nIn a more moderate form, cholera may produce only mild diarrhea. And many people may experience no symptoms but harbor the bacterium and pass it to others. Thus, quarantine is ineffective because carriers are not detected.\nAntibiotics are not essential to recovery but may help shorten the course of illness in severe cases. Worrisome Attack on the Blood\nCholera does not usually spread through the blood. But doctors in Vellore, India, reported that the new strain had invaded the bloodstream of a 51-year-old man with liver disease.\nTwo cholera experts, Dr. Ronald J. Waldman of W.H.O. and Dr. Swerdlow of the Federal center, said it was not known how often the new strain infected the blood stream. If invasion of the blood stream is common with the new strain, it will be more worrisome, Dr. Swerdlow said.\nWhen epidemics strike throughout the world, they are called pandemics. The world has been hit by seven cholera pandemics, beginning in 1817, when cholera surged out of India.\nThe seventh pandemic began in Asia in 1960 and continues today with no signs of abating. It is caused by a type of V. cholerae known as El Tor that can survive in water for long periods. It is the longest-lasting cholera pandemic, accounting for more than three million cases and tens of thousands of deaths, W.H.O. said.\nLaboratory tests suggest that the new strain is hardier and may survive longer than El Tor, scientists at the International Center for Diarrheal Diseases Research in Bangladesh wrote in The Lancet. Adults Attacked First\nWhen the current pandemic reached Africa and South America, where the disease had not been present for a century, it quickly led to high rates of illness and death. It typically strikes adults first, but once it gains a foothold, the tendency is for the disease to strike mostly children.\nEpidemics in India and Bangladesh from the new strain of cholera \"may mark the beginning of the eighth cholera pandemic,\" Dr. Swerdlow and Dr. Ries wrote, and improved transportation and larger numbers of travelers may make its spread even more rapid than in earlier pandemics.\nIf an eighth pandemic develops, Dr. Swerdlow said, he did not know whether it would continue simultaneously with the seventh, or whether the new strain would supplant El Tor worldwide, as it has in India and Bangladesh."}, {"text": "The Architecture of Those Called Homeless\n1993-03-28T05:00:00.000Z\nPepe Otero's place evolved slowly, as so many building projects do.\nIt began as a rudimentary shell made from skids, the wood platforms used for delivery of heavy goods that have become the makeshift building blocks of the street. Time passed. And in a grim symbol of the seeming permanence of his situation, Mr. Otero's shell grew.\nMr. Otero's quarters, in one of Manhattan's poorest neighborhoods, represents a kind of architecture of the dispossessed in New York City. Tucked into the city's most forlorn corners and tenuously echoing a remembered idea of home, these illegal structures are inadequate, but increasingly elaborate, self-made alternatives to the city's shelter system.\nFor thousands of people living on the streets, such fragile dwellings, now being chronicled in museum exhibitions, are a last-ditch effort to carve out a precious, brittle piece of privacy on inhospitable urban turf. A Shadow of a Home\nLike those of his dozen or so neighbors on a formerly vacant lot on the Lower East Side, Mr. Otero's shell has taken on the illusion of home. White bedposts and perforated orange bread crates form an entrance gate; plexiglass and refrigerator shelving set into diamond-shaped frames form windows. Mr. Otero, who is admired locally for his handiwork, has even built a marquesina, or portico, over the front walk.\n\"I had plenty of time,\" Mr. Otero, 67, explained recently, sitting in a small room filled with the smell of kerosene that he was burning against the cold. \"I had to live someplace.\"\nNo one knows their numbers, which fluctuate with the thermometer, night by night and day by day. But in cities across the country, the growing ranks of homeless people and the overburdening of shelter systems have resulted in an increasing number of street builders like Mr. Otero.\nThey are among New York City's most vulnerable citizens. The weather this winter has been particularly grueling for those trying to build precarious dwellings in the city's shadow places: beneath highways, on piers, amid garbage in vacant lots.\nThe resemblances to home are superficial, bitterly so. Mr. Otero is living in conditions commonly associated with third-world countries. He has no plumbing or heating. He bathes in a pail of water hauled from a nearby fire hydrant and heated over a gas burner. His toilet is a white plastic bucket lined with a garbage bag, tucked inconspicuously into a corner and emptied twice a day. The Metaphors 'The Architecture Of Despair'\nMargaret Morton, a New York photographer and an associate professor at the Cooper Union School of Art who has spent three and a half years documenting these structures, including Mr. Otero's, said they represented \"the architecture of despair.\" To her, they reflect \"the profound need to create a sense of home, no matter how extreme the circumstances.\"\nAdvocates for the homeless say the numbers of such shanties are growing nationally, a physical reflection, like the Hoovervilles of the 1930's, of an intractable social problem.\nMary Brosnahan, the executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless in New York City, said that of the 90,000 people her organization estimates to be homeless in the city, about 15,000 have rigged makeshift structures for themselves.\nThe street builders of New York City, she said, are fiercely independent and overwhelmingly male. \"They are the ones who have a working knowledge of building,\" she said. \"They are also familiar with the laws of the street and can protect their areas from predators.\"\nTo John Michael Vlach, the chairman of the American studies department at George Washington University, such bleak icons of domesticity have come to make up a \"landscape of the powerless.\" But he said the transformation of anonymous, often harrowing urban spaces into personal ones, with no resources and against all odds, was a form of self-empowerment that went beyond basic survival.\n\"People make spaces to maintain their sanity,\" he said, \"no matter where they are.\" The Building Process Found Objects, Fond Memories\n\"This is not a house,\" said Thomas Davis, who lives under the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive along the East River in a plywood frame insulated with cardboard, to which he has meticulously added a mailbox, a roped-off deck, a fish-shaped wind gauge and -- most notably -- wheels.\n\"It's a refuge from the elements,\" he said. \"A shack. A box.\"\nCreating a street structure is \"a survival situation,\" Mr. Davis said, adding, \"You improvise.\"\nOne day, he said, he was taking apart automobile parts when he noticed the radiator fan and thought, \"Maybe I could use this for something.\" Mr. Davis remembered a whirligig he had seen as a child in a springtime flower bed. \"The wings would be moving,\" he recalled.\nThe sight of blimps floating above the East River and people fishing in summertime gave him the idea of building a \"flying fish in the wind.\"\nTo the uninitiated, who often view them from moving vehicles, structures like Mr. Davis's don't look like living quarters. \"They are looked on as a dump spot, an eyesore,\" Douglas Anderson, 32, said one frigid morning, as embers from the skids he was burning for warmth in an oil drum turned to ash in the wind. \"But if you saw this place up close, you would see it's a home, with a personal touch.\" Repelling Rain and Rats\nIt took him more than two months and \"nails, hammers and manpower\" to put up his structure, a plywood frame with a pitched roof covered by a tarp \"so the rain runs right off.\" The bottom is lined with scavenged Formica panels, prized by street builders because they repel rats and water. He arranged an outdoor sitting area out of weatherworn office chairs found in trash bins, tacking a faded Oriental rug to the wall behind them.\n\"You should try to think you're living indoors as much as you can,\" he said. \"If you've got to live out here, you want it to be comfortable, to do the best you can. If you wander around thinking, 'My God, I'm homeless,' you're finished.\"\nMaria Foscarinis, the director of the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty in Washington, said the structures were growing in number as homelessness increased nationally. \"Homeless people are relying on their own resourcefulness to address a problem that is not being adequately addressed by society,\" she said. \"These are measures intended to be temporary that are now becoming permanent.\" The Chroniclers What Academics And Cameras See\nA palpable yearning for permanence pervades both the structures and Ms. Morton's photographs of them, which are the subject of exhibitions at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in Manhattan and the NAME Gallery in Chicago, as well as \"Transitory Gardens,\" a book that Ms. Morton wrote with Diana Balmori, a landscape historian; it is to be published this year by Yale University Press.\nMs. Morton noted that the structures, which their builders often refer to as \"my place,\" tend to change seasonally and are continually being improved, sometimes to reflect the homelands of those who live in them.\nMr. Otero, for example, came to New York from Puerto Rico to seek employment as a typesetter and wound up with a job fixing lamps. Unable to make ends meet, he gave up his rented room and moved to Tompkins Square Park in early 1990, preferring his own shelter to one with a squalid shared bathroom.\nThat summer, Mr. Otero began building his structure in a nearby settlement that is known by its occupants as \"Bushville,\" erecting an umbrella for shade and adding an open porch with a turquoise-and-white striped canopy. In November of the next year, he enclosed the porch. Last spring, he began extending the roof. His construction ideas come \"from here,\" he said, pointing to his head.\nOver time, encampments like Bushville, with its public walkways lined with skids and touches of ornament, form \"unknown cities within the city,\" in the words of Richard Sennett, a professor of humanities at New York University. \"The foundation of self-respect in our society is not having cash, but a place to live,\" he said, adding that the structures \"are inexpressibly sad symbols of the way society has abandoned them.\" The Government View There's No Code For Wiring Shacks\nA piece of plywood tacked with cardboard, or a frayed strip of carpet placed outside to define a front yard, is homelessness made visible. \"This isn't housing,\" said Marsha Martin, the director of the Mayor's Office on Homelessness and Single Room Occupancy Housing Services. \"There is no standard to evaluate a Sterno can in a cardboard box.\"\nMichael Kharfen, head of the Mayor's Community Assistance Unit, said many street builders represented the \"hard-core homeless population\" of New York City. Many are drug or alcohol abusers, he added. The city's concern over the encampments, the target of periodic removals, or \"sweeps,\" has focused on health and safety issues, he said, particularly the use of kerosene and other flammable materials to generate heat.\nThe encampments typically exist on marginal property on the periphery of the urban mainstream. Ms. Martin pointed out that in a legal sense, the structures are not buildings and are thus not monitored by the City Building Department. If a safety or health or sanitation concern arises, or if threatening conduct occurs in the street, the city will consider intervention case by case, she said.\nSince Ms. Morton began photographing the structures, five of her subjects have died. One, Yi Poi Lee, was killed. Mr. Lee, who lived in a hut bound together by yellow cloth tied in knots -- no nails were used -- died last spring when arsonists set fire to \"The Hill,\" an encampment at the foot of the Manhattan Bridge in Chinatown. So he would not be buried in Potter's Field, Ms. Morton and a colleague organized the funeral. The Quest for a Haven Ever So Humble, But It's Private\nSecurity is a big concern among street builders. A reason commonly cited by homeless people for rejecting the city's shelter system is a lack of security. Settlements like Mr. Otero's, ad hoc though they be, are arranged to foster security, often with a \"day watchman\" standing guard.\nBut the big reason people build may be more compelling. However fragile, the presence of four walls \"affords them the same security and sense of privacy that our homes afford us,\" Ms. Brosnahan said.\n\"It's a place to cook, a place where friends can visit and lovers can stay overnight,\" she said. \"It is a rejection of the institution of the shelters, where your soul is checked at the door.\"\nShe added that the structures held a message for those planning future housing for the homeless. \"At the bare minimum,\" she said, \"we're talking about a small, secure room with a door that locks.\" The Worldwide Problem\nAmos Rapoport, a professor of architecture at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, said \"spontaneous settlements\" built by homeless people, like Bushville in New York and the Mud Flats in Miami, suggest the \"no-tech\" shanty settlements throughout the third world: the hillside favelas of Rio de Janeiro, the villas miserias of Argentina, the barrios clandestinos of Colombia, the gecekondus of Ankara, Turkey, and the bamboo riverside huts near the mouth of the Ganges in Dhaka, Bangladesh.\nSuch settlements, whose hallmarks are often bits of flattened cardboard and corrugated metal roofs weighed down by rocks, have resulted largely from the rural displacement and rapid urbanization that followed World War II, he said.\nAmong all displaced builders, \"the sense of control is important,\" he said, adding: \"Even if conditions are worse than a city shelter, they have still made choices regarding their environment.\" The Implacable Weather\nIn the northeaster in December, Mr. Anderson was trapped inside his structure and had to break through a wall to escape flooding. Most of his belongings were swept away. He briefly went to a shelter, but, he said, \"I didn't feel comfortable with it: too many different personalities.\"\nHe said with some pride that the northeaster had not destroyed the structure itself, unlike \"those houses in New Jersey\" that appeared on the news. Still, nature's wrath took a toll. \"If you could have seen this place before that, you would have liked what you saw,\" he said. \"There were no cracks. All this wood was meshed together. It was looking real good.\"\nMr. Anderson said he grew up in East New York, Brooklyn. The house he lived in as a young child burned down. The things he remembers most about it are the long kitchen table, where the family could be together, and the fact that to enter, \"you stuck a key in the door.\"\nHe is now unemployed, and he vacated the $120-a-week room he had rented with money from a temporary job, because of \"the overhead.\" Across a Street, Out of Reach\nHe is realistic about his present living situation. \" That ,\" he said, pointing to a brick apartment building across the street, \"is definitely better than this. Everyone should have some decent roof overhead. We're all entitled to that.\"\nHe sometimes thinks about what a real house would be like. \"At night, you'd see the stars,\" he said, \"and during the day, the light would just flood the room.\"\nBut he feels good about the structure he built, which he considers a \"launch point.\"\n\"Everything we needed, we solved,\" he said of the community that he and his neighbors have built and that Ms. Morton has recorded. He is proud of Mr. Davis and his flying fish. \"We call his place Little House on the Prairie,\" Mr. Anderson said. \"He's so good you can't walk past his place without saying, 'Wow!' \"\n\"You know something?\" he continued, pressed about his own dwelling. \"It took character to build that. A lot of feeling went into it. Building it shaped my attitude. You realize you can do things for yourself. People who build for themselves have an interest in themselves. As long as you don't forget, you're not forgotten.\"\nMr. Anderson knows what a home is. \"A home,\" he said, \"is the idea of who you are.\""}, {"text": "Western Europe Is Ending Its Welcome to Immigrants\n1993-08-10T05:00:00.000Z\nFearfully, painfully, the nations of Western Europe are recognizing that immigration is probably the most explosive problem they face, and they are taking drastic steps to fend off unwanted foreigners.\nFrance, Germany, Britain -- all the Western European countries, from Sweden to Greece -- feel that they are under siege as hundreds of thousands of poor people cross the newly opened borders of Eastern Europe or flee economically desperate countries in Africa and Southeast Asia.\nOnce grudgingly tolerated because they were willing to work in low-wage jobs like ditch digging or street cleaning, the newcomers are now seen as competitors, and many have become targets of wrath as the worst recession in decades tightens its grip. As a result, Western European governments are rushing to adopt new laws and strategies to shut out immigrants. Tougher Tests for Asylum\nTo the distress of international organizations, the nations are also making it harder for refugees fleeing political persecution to find safe havens.\nIn a camp on the site of a former Belgian military barracks outside Cologne, 430 people from around the world await word on their fate, most likely expulsion. After months of suspense, some have smashed the toilet plumbing and television sets in frustration.\n\"I don't know what to do,\" said Ali Ibrahim Jackson, a 19-year-old Liberian lounging against a wire fence in a bright blue track suit on a recent afternoon. Three months ago he stowed away on a freighter from Nigeria to Bremen with visions of becoming a soccer star.\n\"I can't go back,\" he said of Liberia, where a fragile cease-fire took hold last week after more than three years of civil war. \"I walk the street and I'm a dead man.\" Abandoning Postwar Ideal\nThere is no assurance that Western Europe will be able to close the door entirely, much less lock it. But in its efforts to do so, it is relinquishing a principle born from the ashes of World War II, that it should offer sanctuary to the world's persecuted and dispossessed.\n\"It's ironic: Europe was the inspiration for proper treatment of refugees the world over, and now they're trying to contain them,\" said Arthur Helton, who leads the refugee committee of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. \"That raises a question -- was asylum just a cold-war luxury all along? It seems so.\"\nIn their economic distress, Western Europeans are turning against the strangers in their midst, including the 2.8 million who are living illegally in the 17 countries. In the European Community the unemployment rate is expected to pass 12 percent next year, meaning that 19 million people will be out of work.\nRight-wing parties are trying to build constituencies by campaigning on a platform of expulsions of \"foreigners.\" While there is little immediate danger that far-right parties will come to power on a national level, governments are shifting to the right on the immigration issue to blunt the threat.\nWestern European leaders are worried about rising xenophobia and racism and increasing attacks upon foreigners by neo-Nazis and skinheads. Nervously, they listen to the speeches of ideologues who hark back to a bygone era when their countries were supposedly homogeneous, comfortable, orderly and virtually all white.\nBut the changes in the ethnic makeup of Western Europe are already irrevocable. For generations Pakistanis have lived in Britain, Algerians in France and Turks in Germany, and even though they are regarded by some people as alien, they are there to stay. 'Fortress Europe' The Open Doors Are Closing Hard\n\"Fortress Europe\" is the name loosely given to the European Community's vision of a great domain of a dozen countries with no tariffs or borders to slow the internal flow of goods and people but big protective walls around the periphery.\nA fortress mentality already exists.\nIn Europe's southern countries, where young people once went abroad to start new lives and wrote home about the prejudice they encountered, people are startled to find that they are now the hosts, and can themselves be bigoted toward newcomers.\nIn the Madrid suburb of Aravaca, thugs called \"rapadas\" break into an abandoned building where Dominican squatters are living, and one opens fire with a pistol. In Rome, \"Nazi-skins\" torch residences of foreigners and patrol the parks at night, beating up Africans who sleep there.\n\"I have no papers,\" said Joel Guehi, who came to Rome three months ago from the Ivory Coast. \"I can get no work. I sleep in the park, and I'm scared every night.\"\nGermany has revised its Constitution, eviscerating the well-known Article XVI. Symbolically a form of moral compensation for the Germans who found safe haven from the Nazis during World War II, the provision promised asylum to \"people persecuted on political grounds.\" That clause was a loophole that brought in 438,000 immigrants last year. On July 1 the provision expired, and Germany's immigration policy became one of the most restrictive in Europe. The number of asylum applicants in July was about 10,000 lower than in June, and German officials expect the decline to continue.\nFrance has given up on the almost mystical idea, traceable to the Revolution, that just being born on French soil was enough to qualify one as French. Now there is a more mundane requirement: To obtain citizenship, people born in France to non-French parents must formally apply between the ages of 16 and 21, a time when young men are called up for military service. And the rightist Interior Minister, Charles Pasqua, has proclaimed a goal of \"zero immigration.\"\nBut no country has gone as far as Greece. Feeling overwhelmed by about 200,000 Albanians who slipped across the mountainous border over the last three years, the Athens Government recently seized upon the expulsion of a Greek Orthodox priest from southern Albania as a justification to round up and expel more than 25,000 Albanians. Some Greeks have taken to calling the police to provide addresses of illegal residents. Albanians say they have been beaten and robbed by police officers before being pushed across the border.\nOn Tuesdays and Fridays, busloads pass through the wire gate at the border checkpoint of Kakavia. An 18-year-old who was being escorted back by the border police on a recent Sunday was asked where he had been. He had spent four months in Crete, he said, clearing rocks from farmland and earning the equivalent of $17 a day in Greek drachmas. \"Real money,\" he said.\nWould he return? He smiled sheepishly, looked at his guards and said yes, he would. The Numbers Up to 2 Million Flow In Each Year\nThe numbers are inexorable.\nA United Nations Population Fund report estimates that from 1980 to 1992 15 million people poured into Western Europe as migrants. Officials at the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees roughly estimate that the number of newcomers is still running at between one and two million a year. For a region of some 300 million that exported its own people up until the 1970's, that seems to constitute an invasion.\nEven the number of political refugees has mushroomed in Western Europe. Up until the mid-1970's there were about 30,000 a year, and most fit the definition of the 1951 Geneva Convention -- that is, they had a \"well-founded fear of persecution\" in their home countries.\nBut as a side door for people fleeing economic deprivation, asylum requests rose dramatically, reaching 700,000 last year and costing governments an estimated $8.3 billion. In the decade through 1992, nearly three million applications for asylum. The vast majority were rejected, although the applicants almost always managed to stay on after appeals that lasted for years.\nUnlike earlier postwar immigrants from southern Europe, many of the newcomers differ from longer-term inhabitants in skin color and religion. Millions of them did not assimilate, congregating instead in virtual ghettos on the outskirts of the cities.\nThe 2.6 million people in Britain considered members of ethnic minorities -- 5 percent of the nation's 56 million people -- include West Indians, Bangladeshis, Indians, West Africans, Pakistanis and others. Almost half of them were born in Britain, and as British natives naturally identify themselves as British rather than, say, black African or black Caribbean. But they are not always viewed that way by whites.\nThe number of racially motivated incidents reported to the police in Britain has skyrocketed, from 4,383 in 1988 to 7,793 in 1992. In May Winston Churchill, the grandson of the wartime Prime Minister, called for a halt to the \"relentless flow of immigrants,\" saying it was threatening to change Britain's way of life forever. Though his speech was condemned in editorials, he said that he had received 7,500 letters and that \"they were 100 to 1 in support.\"\nEven though many Britons seem to think immigrants are pouring in, that is no longer the case. \"Primary immigration into this country ceased years ago -- I mean, years ago,\" said Charles Wardle, the Home Office Minister responsible for immigration. Last year, 52,000 were admitted, because they were judged to have special skills, so they could be reunited with their families, or on other narrow grounds.\nBut globally, there is no prospect that pressure for migration will cease. A recent United Nations Population Fund report estimates that at least 100 million international migrants live outside the countries where they were born. The tide of people crossing borders to flee war, drought and economic misery \"could become the human crisis of our age,\" it said.\nSmuggling gangs fill boatloads of Chinese destined for California, Haitians take to the seas in rickety boats trying to reach Florida, and thousands of Africans step aboard planes destined for Europe. In one case, 156 Iraqis chartered an Egyptian airliner and flew to London to request asylum.\n\"There are no distances any longer in this world,\" said Dr. Manfred Matzka, Austria's Director of Immigration. \"There are no islands.\" Asylum Tougher Path For Refugees\nIn Austria, the Traiskirchen camp, 20 miles outside Vienna, is known as the Ellis Island of the West. After the suppression of the 1956 uprising in Hungary, it took in 180,000 Hungarians; after the reform movement known as the Prague Spring was crushed in 1968, 150,000 Czechs or Slovaks; after martial law was declared in Poland in 1981, 40,000 Poles. Passing through Traiskirchen was, former Chancellor Bruno Kreisky used to remark, the Austrian equivalent of the Nobel Prize.\nBut in June 1992, Austria adopted a new and complicated law that made political asylum very difficult to obtain. It deals quickly with \"manifestly unfounded\" cases -- applicants with dubious claims -- and sends them right back where they came from. It also asserts that anyone who comes through a \"safe\" country can be deemed to have found protection there.\nThe law was effective. In the first six months of 1992, there were 11,875 applications for asylum. In the first six months of 1993, there were only 2,490, a 75 percent decrease.\nThe same principles are now widely applied in Europe, where nine countries have grouped together in what is called the Schengen convention to \"harmonize\" restrictions. Western European countries have now declared surrounding countries \"safe,\" so in effect no refugee can win asylum by coming overland through another country.\nThe chances of arriving through an airport are now minimal too, because visa requirements have been imposed on some 110 countries. Many European countries insist that refugees passing through a transit lounge of another country are in effect \"staying\" there. Airlines that carry a passenger without a valid passport and visas face fines up to $3,000, a policy that Britain began in 1987.\n\"About the only way to get asylum these days is to land in a balloon in the center of the country with all your papers in order,\" quipped Hans Staudinger, a legal officer for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Vienna.\nCountries are also demanding stringent proof that an asylum seeker is likely to be persecuted. This is not always easy to provide. \"I was tried in absentia and condemned to death,\" said Thomas Kingston, a 26-year-old Liberian in a German camp. He added with a bitter smile, \"They did not give me a copy of my sentence.\"\nGiven the new requirements, international organizations worry that governments will return bona fide political refugees to the countries that persecute them, often by bouncing them backward through the countries they passed through to get away.\nImmigration officials reply that the goal is to weed out genuine political refugees from the economic migrants who have been abusing the asylum process and bring the system under control. \"It's not a question of morals; it's wisdom,\" said Manfred Matzka, who put through the new Austrian laws. \"In international migration there is a point at which it becomes chaotic and there is no longer a means to control it.\"\nOne of the first cases decided under the tough new asylum policy that took effect in Germany on July 1 was that of a young Tamil from Sri Lanka, where young men of that mostly Hindu ethnic minority are often suspected of belonging to separatist guerrilla groups.\nHe arrived in Frankfurt and was able to show that he had been imprisoned in Colombo, the capital, five times. He was denied asylum on July 6 because, the decision papers say, \"he was held only for short periods, and this does not constitute political persecution.\" The case is being appealed. New Measures Computer Checks And Troop Patrols\nThe Schengen agreement, under which all European Community countries except for Britain, Ireland and Denmark are to dispense with internal borders and strengthen their parts of the community's external borders, is supposed to take effect in December.\nBut the accord is already causing anxiety, especially in France, which fears a flood of drugs from the Netherlands and a wave of illegal immigrants from Italy and Spain. To help allay such fears, the governments involved have agreed to give police officers extra powers to do things like check documents within 25 miles of the internal borders.\nLike any fortress, \"Fortress Europe\" needs a moat, and the one that is being developed is a 20th-century version -- a computer system called S.I.S. The system will maintain a data base so that the denial of asylum to an applicant in one country will be recorded everywhere. Another system, EURO DAC, which uses fingerprints for identification, will link police stations so \"undesirables\" can be quickly spotted.\nBut the countries are not waiting until Schengen goes into effect to take action against the flood of immigrants. Austria has sent 2,000 troops to try to seal the Hungarian border. Germany has bolstered its forces along the Polish border and installed infrared equipment to intercept the thousands from Lithuania, Belarus and other Eastern European countries who make it nightly across the Neisse, Europe's equivalent of the Rio Grande.\nGermany sends planes full of deportees to Bucharest almost every day. In May it signed an agreement with Warsaw to send illegal immigrants who are found to have passed through Poland back there -- as many as 10,000 this year and an unlimited number in 1993.\nUnder Mr. Pasqua's direction, France is adopting the strictest measures of all -- making it harder for foreigners to acquire French nationality through marriages of convenience, cutting back on work permits and refusing to allow additional wives from polygamous marriages into the country.\nThe debate over a bill to expand police powers to stop foreigners and check for documents almost completely sidestepped race, though it was on everyone's mind. How would French police officers be able to spot suspected foreigners? Perhaps, the bill's neo-Gaullist author, Alain Marsaud, disingenuously suggested, \"If you are reading The New York Times on the street, you may be presumed to be a foreigner.\"\n\"The police already stop foreigners -- they do it all the time now,\" said Zoubida Djelali, an Algerian doctor who works at a clinic run by the medical charity Doctors of the World. \"They just go by the color of the face.\" Over the last two or three years, she said, she has witnessed a quiet crackdown on foreigners in areas like access to health care, the speed of rejection of asylum applications and interpretation of nationality requirements.\nOf France's population of 57 million, about 4 million, or 7 percent, are foreigners, according to figures from the French Interior Ministry.\n\"They believe they'll be richer if they toss us out,\" Dr. Djelali said. \"They think there will be less unemployment. It's a fiction. Look at the work the foreigners do -- maids, busboys, hauling wheelbarrows on construction sites. Underpaid or dangerous. The French won't take those kinds of jobs.\" The Right Trying to Pre-empt Demand for Curbs\nThe changes in France's immigration policy are not a response to a sudden surge in xenophobia. They represent campaign commitments by the two main conservative parties now in power to expropriate an issue that had long been exploited by Jean-Marie Le Pen's far-right National Front. Some 60 percent of France's foreigners are non-Europeans, mostly from Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco, and they are concentrated in the grimy industrial suburbs where the National Front pulls 30 to 40 percent of the vote in elections.\nAlmost every country has a burgeoning far-right party circulating anti-Semitic tracts and whipping up anti-foreign sentiment. There is the Freedom Party in Austria, the Republican Party in Germany, the Vlaams Blok in Belgium, the Falangists in Spain and the Northern League in Italy.\nGermany's central intelligence office calculates that 41,900 of its citizens belong to far-right organizations, of which 6,400 are \"militant and violence-prone.\" That figure does not include some 25,000 members of the Republican Party. In 1992, there were 2,584 proven acts of violence by the far right, a 74 percent increase over 1991. Of the rightist attacks, 88 percent were directed against foreigners, of whom seven died.\nWhether the far-right parties are losing ground to the \"responsible right,\" or actually gaining in stature as the establishment tries to accommodate the discontent stoked by the far right is debatable. But the tone of discourse points to other changes in Western Europe, on a deeper, psychological level.\nWestern Europe is giving up its sense of itself as a civilizing corner of the world. After the horrors and guilt of the Holocaust and the Nazi occupation of much of Europe, the region has tried to compensate for the past by tending an image of itself as an assembly of decent societies. It may not have been the powerhouse on the world stage it once was, the argument ran, but at least it was a haven of toleration, democracy and respect for human rights.\nWestern Europe conceived of itself as a benign patron. It was inordinately proud of its medieval universities, of its cafes that nurtured conspiring Ethiopian Marxists, of its nightclubs that embraced expatriate black American jazz musicians.\nToday that self-image seems increasingly untenable. There is still room for visitors and the occasional refugees, but the immigrants needed to keep the economies going are encountering more and more hostility. Western European countries are turning inward, some social critics worry, and becoming increasingly self-absorbed, intolerant and culturally hegemonistic.\nA survey conducted by the European Commission and released on July 15 disclosed that for the first time, public opinion in the European Community had swung against immigrants from outside the 12 countries. Fifty-two percent of those polled said there were too many immigrants.\n\"There is a psychological backlash,\" said Ruprecht von Arnim of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees office in Brussels, \"but the reason is not just racism, or economic difficulties. There was clearly the feeling that the countries had lost control over what was happening to them. The politicians picked up the anxieties of the people and carried them one step farther.\n\"I could see how looking in from the outside, a lot of people might think that these countries have lost their souls.\"\nNEXT: Fading confidence in the governing elite."}, {"text": "DINING OUT; In Torrington, Spicy Subcontinental Fare\n1993-08-22T05:00:00.000Z\nINDIAN restaurants are so rare in Connecticut that discovering Indo-Bangla in Torrington comes as a treat for any fan of the hot, well-spiced food of the subcontinent.\nThat's the good news. The less happy report is that one wishes it were better. It's not just that the restaurant itself is so lackluster -- a large, characterless room in a freestanding building, with wood-veneer booths, low ceiling and tile flooring. None of that would matter if the food tasted fresher and had more zest and zip. It wasn't bad; in fact, a few dishes were actually delicious, but many others tasted as though the kitchen were just going through the motions.\nMost Indian dishes are complex and require considerable preparation, thus a restaurant needs a steady day-in, day-out clientele for the food to be freshly prepared and at its best. Otherwise, if there isn't that steady traffic, the dishes are sometimes held over and often end up tasting tired. It is a cuisine that is perhaps best suited to a large population center with adventurous diners.\nIndo-Bangla deserves passing marks for trying to introduce this fascinating and diverse cuisine to the Torrington area, and even higher marks for making prices so accessible. While portions are small, as is often the case in Indian restaurants, several extras are included in the price of each entree, adding considerably to the value. These include onion relish (a delicious, spicy mixture of coarsely chopped raw onions, green pepper, cumin and red hot pepper), dal (lentils in a soupy state), tamarind sauce (thinner and sweeter than usual), cobe vajee (steamed, deeply spiced, shredded cabbage) and basmati rice (a generous portion, with sultana raisins, almonds, bay leaf, cardomom pods and wisps of fried onion).\nMany dishes at Indo-Bangla (named for both India and Bangladesh) will be familiar to aficionados of Indian food. Especially well-made and fresh-tasting was lamb sajahani, a Moghul specialty that immersed chunks of braised lamb in a well-seasoned, ground-almond cream sauce. Lamb saag, which blended lamb with spinach and spices, lacked sparkle.\nSaag paneer, which joins creamy cooked spinach with little cubes of bland farmer-style cheese, can be a well-resonated dish, as the Indian cuisine often does wonders with spinach and other vegetables. In this instance, though, the spicing was muted and the net effect was on the blah side.\nShrimp vindaloo, a Goan specialty, was skimpy with the jumbo shrimp, all too generous with potato chunks, and profuse with the fiery hot, cayenne-fueled sauce. Vindaloo is usually the hottest item on an Indian menu. At Indo-Bangla, where punches were pulled on many other dishes, the vindaloo was full throttle, four alarm, requiring a few spoonfuls of the refreshingly cool yogurt dish called raita to quench the fire.\nChicken dhansak was a dish that needed an infusion of pep. A mixture of chicken pieces, spinach and lentils, it was listed as \"a little hot\" but was surprisingly subdued. Chicken Madras, another traditionally hot South Indian number, was indeed incendiary. A paltry serving of dry-baked chicken tikka had intense seasoning but tasted reheated.\nOne of the better dishes at Indo-Bangla was chhole poori, a well-spiced appetizer of chickpeas, tomatoes, onions, cumin and other seasonings, served with puffy, if greasy, poori bread. Naan, the popular, soft unleavened bread served with so many Indian dishes, wasn't real naan but warmed pita bread.\nThere is no liquor, beer or wine license at Indo-Bangla, but you are welcome to bring your own. You can pay as little as $10 a person at Indo-Bangla for an appetizer and entree. It's hard to dine out more economically than that.\nA LA CARTE -- Rumba, the small, bouncy Cuban-Caribbean restaurant in Danbury, moved to larger quarters last month.

The workers are often bused straight from the airport to squalid barracks where they live -- sometimes for years -- as many as a dozen to a room.\nThey are put to work almost immediately in nearby factories within view of Saipan's pristine beaches, many of them laboring six days a week at about half the Federal minimum wage, stitching together American brand-name clothes. Familiar Labels\nThe labels would be familiar to anyone who has strolled through an American shopping mall. Over the last year, Arrow, Liz Claiborne, The Gap, Montgomery Ward, Geoffrey Beene, Eddie Bauer and Levi's have all made clothes on this palm-fringed island that is part of the American commonwealth in the Western Pacific, 5,000 miles from the continental United States.\nAnd while many of these garments are manufactured in foreign-owned factories by foreign workers, the apparel made in the Northern Marianas often bears another familiar label: \"Made in the U.S.A.\" The American flag flies over several of the factories.\nAn estimated $279 million worth of wholesale clothing, virtually all of it made by foreign labor, was shipped from here last year to the United States. Part of America at $2.15 an Hour\n\"We come here because we make more money here than in China, and because the recruiters in China tell us that Saipan is part of America,\" said a $2.15-an-hour factory worker from a village near Shanghai.\nThe woman, who is in her early 20's, invited a visitor into the cramped barracks room that she shares with seven other women, their beds separated only by flimsy cloth sheets. The room also serves as a kitchen.\n\"They are not good conditions,\" she says, wrinkling her nose and pointing to a mildewy hallway strewn with litter. \"If we complain, then our bosses would send us back to China and take away all of our money. Our families need the money.\" The Sweatshops No Comment From the Mall\nThe biggest industries here -- garment manufacturing, tourism and construction -- are all dependent on poorly paid foreign labor, which explains why of the 42,000 people who live in the Northern Marianas, of which Saipan is the largest, more than half are foreign workers.\nWhile clothing from the Northern Marianas made up only about 1 percent of the $29 billion in clothing imported into the United States last year, it accounts for as much as 20 percent of the clothing sold by some large American companies.\nSeveral big manufacturers doing business here are silent when asked about labor practices or about the volume of clothing they import. Spokesmen for Arrow, The Gap and Montgomery Ward either did not return phone calls or said they had no comment on labor conditions in the islands.\nA Claiborne spokeswoman acknowledged that the company did make \"a small percentage\" of its clothing in the Northern Marianas. A spokeswoman for Eddie Bauer said the factories here produced only \"an insignificant percentage\" of the company's goods. Neither company would discuss import figures. Industry Battles Abuses\nThe industry's trade group, the American Apparel Manufacturers Association, said its members were doing their best to end labor abuses in the islands.\n\"We oppose sweatshops wherever they are,\" said Larry Martin, the association's spokesman. \"We believe and hope that our members are abiding by all labor laws.\"\nOne clothing manufacturer, Levi Strauss & Co., has been notably aggressive in trying to end labor abuses in Saipan. While it continues to make shirts at five plants on the island, it ended its contracts last year with the island's largest clothesmaker, Willie Tan, after an investigation by Levi's found evidence of \"unsatisfactory treatment of workers and violation of the law\" in his factories.\nWhile insisting that his companies never abused or cheated workers, Mr. Tan, a Philippine-born American businessman, did agree last year to pay $9 million in back wages and damages to laborers, most of them Chinese, under a settlement with the United States Labor Department. Legal Servitude\nThe plight of foreign workers in the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands has outraged the few Federal investigators who have made the long journey across the Pacific -- Saipan is far closer to China and the Philippines than it is to Hawaii -- even as they acknowledge that most of what goes on here is within the law. Visitors to the islands are also startled by what they see.\n\"It certainly has its parallels to slavery or indentured servitude,\" said Neils Jensen, a Christian missionary from New Zealand who has lived intermittently on Saipan since 1983. \"Many of these workers go into debt for what they think will be the privilege of working on Saipan. Because they're so deeply in debt, they can't afford to retaliate or complain or leave. Their conditions are horrendous.\"\nOver the years Washington has granted a variety of concessions to businesses in Saipan to encourage economic growth and to end generations of subsistence living for the local islanders. For decades, the largest employer had been the United States Trust Territory government.\nUnder an agreement approved in 1976, the islands were exempted from the Federal minimum wage. The commonwealth government now sets its own minimum wage, which has been $2.15 an hour since 1984. (Other American territories, including Guam, which is only 120 miles from Saipan, use the higher Federal guaranteed minimum of $4.25 an hour.) The Exploited A Life of Misery Under Old Glory\nYet the Chinese garment workers almost certainly have it better than many of the other foreign laborers here.\nThousands of Filipinos are employed in the Northern Marianas as construction workers or maids, jobs that are currently exempted from the islands' $2.15 minimum wage. Many young Filipino women are brought to Saipan to work in bars where, they say, they are forced by their employers to serve as prostitutes for the islands' tourists, most of them Japanese visitors on package tours.\nThe plight of Asian immigrants who are willing to take great risks to live and to work in the United States drew international attention in May, when a rusty freighter carrying 300 undocumented Chinese immigrants ran aground in New York.\nIn Saipan, Asian laborers arrive legally, usually in the comfort of a commercial jet. But there is plenty of evidence to suggest that many of the estimated 23,000 foreign laborers in these islands, like their undocumented counterparts in the continental United States, face a life of exploitation and misery under the American flag.\nSaipan is the largest of the 14 volcanic islands that make up the Northern Marianas, scene of some of the bloodiest fighting of World War II. McDonald's and TV Reruns\nAfter the war, the islands became a territory of the United States and eventually a commonwealth. The islanders are American citizens, and there are reminders everywhere of their ties to the United States, from the new McDonald's restaurant to a cable-television system that rebroadcasts \"Murphy Brown\" and the \"Today Show.\"\nThe garment industry was established in the early 1980's as a result of Federal rules that allow manufacturers here to export clothing to the American mainland duty free and largely without quotas.\nThere are now more than 20 factories, most of them owned by foreign investors who were also lured here by the islands' liberal investment and immigration laws.\nUnder commonwealth law, foreign investors are welcome, and they have brought with them a flood of foreign workers who are willing to accept minimum-wage jobs that local islanders routinely reject. Most of the islanders work for the local government and receive much more than the minimum wage.\nThe commonwealth's Governor, Lorenzo I. DeLeon Guerrero, said that he had heard the slave-labor comparisons in discussions of foreign workers. \"It is an insult to us,\" he said. \"There's no slavery here.\"\nBut he also readily acknowledged that some employers take advantage of foreign workers. \"It's very true that the conditions of these people should be far better,\" the Governor said. \"We have to be honest about that.\" The Reformers 30\u00a6 an Hour Raise And Barbed Wire\nThe local legislature approved a law this year to raise the minimum wage by 30 cents a year for each of the next seven years and to apply the minimum to construction workers. The Governor has proposed the creation of a human rights commission to protect the rights of workers.\nBut the reforms do not go far enough to satisfy many of the commonwealth's critics -- under the new law, Saipan's minimum wage will not match the current Federal minimum of $4.25 until 1999 -- and there are threats in Congress this year to cut off more than $120 million in Federal subsidies.\n\"I'm afraid that an awful lot of time and motion is being wasted trying to give the appearance of reform instead of actually making real, structural changes,\" said Representative George Miller, a California Democrat who is chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, which oversees American territories.\nAmerican labor unions charge that, because of the low wages paid to foreign workers, the Northern Marianas are stealing jobs from textile workers in the United States. The unions want the Government to crack down on the labor abuses here.\n\"We have rules for protecting products, such as copyright laws, but seemingly we have no rules to protect the workers who produce the product -- if they happen to be in Saipan,\" said Arthur Gundersheim, director of international affairs for the Amalgamated Clothing & Textile Workers Union. No Water or Electricity\nWhile commonwealth officials insist they are trying to improve the living conditions of foreign workers, the improvements are not evident in large Saipan neighborhoods like Susupe, where several oversize tin-roof plywood shacks serve as workers' barracks. Often they have no regular water or electricity.\nIn larger barracks, workers complain of living in virtual captivity, their housing ringed with barbed wire and patrolled by teams of uniformed guards.\n\"The girls have no freedom,\" said a 29-year-old Filipino who worked in a bar for five months before \"escaping\" last year and finding a different job. She asked that her name not be used for fear that her family in the Philippines would learn that she had worked as a prostitute.\nWhile working at the bar, she lived with 20 other women in a three-bedroom house that they were rarely allowed to leave. \"We were told that we could not go outside by ourselves, ever,\" she said. \"The boss was afraid that we would have boyfriends and would sleep with them without getting money for him.\" 'Going to America'\nThe exploitation of workers often begins long before they arrive here. Many pay large recruitment fees to middlemen in their homelands who find them jobs in Saipan. No matter how terrible the working conditions, they say, they cannot think of going home until the money is earned back.\nMasudur Rahman, 30, said his impoverished family in Bangladesh sold off much of its farmland outside Dhaka, the capital, to raise the $4,000 fee demanded by the recruiters for a construction job \"where the American flag is flying.\" Although the recruiter promised a job paying $1,500 a month, Mr. Rahman said, he never received more than $250 a month.\nHe said he was startled to discover once he arrived in Saipan that he, like virtually all other foreign laborers, had no right to travel on to the United States.\n\"The recruitment agent said we were going to America,\" Mr. Rahman recalled. \"He never said Saipan.\" The Exploiters The Harsh Lessons Of Free Enterprise\nAmong the garment industry employers, no one here had been more successful than Mr. Tan, whose family controls clothing factories that employ hundreds of foreign workers and ship millions of dollars worth of clothing each year to the mainland United States.\nBut Mr. Tan's luck appeared to run out last year, when he agreed to pay $9 million in back wages and damages to more than 1,000 factory workers to settle the Labor Department charges. The department's investigators said that workers in Mr. Tan's factories put in as many as 90 hours a week without overtime and were routinely paid as little as $1.65 an hour.\nSeparately, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration announced last year that its investigation had found \"appalling living and working conditions\" in Saipan garment factories and barracks, including those controlled by Mr. Tan.\nAlthough Federal regulations require that workers receive a minimum of 100 square feet of space per person to cook and sleep, six of Mr. Tan's workers were found living in one room of 190 square feet. Toilet facilities were primitive. Charges Are Dropped\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration dropped the charges after the Tan companies made $1.3 million in repairs to the factories and barracks and agreed to pay $76,000 in penalties.\nHis lawyer, Robert J. O'Connor, said that Mr. Tan agreed to pay the back wages only because the Labor Department was harassing some of the factories' clients.\n\"The Labor Department was putting pressure on our buyers by putting out press releases implying that they were linked to slave labor,\" he said. \"\"We were coerced into the settlement.\"\nMr. O'Connor said that the wages had been withheld not by Mr. Tan's companies, but by Chinese Government supervisors under a longstanding agreement with the workers.\n\"We know that 97 percent of all the workers who work for Mr. Tan have asked to have their contracts extended,\" Mr. O'Connor said.\n\"When they are here,\" he said of the Chinese laborers, \"they learn about free enterprise, democracy -- they become good-will ambassadors of our precepts of democracy.\"\nThat is not borne out by the scores of affidavits gathered by the Labor Department from the Chinese workers. The company \"makes use of all kinds of illegal methods to steal our blood money,\" said Hu Li Yue, a factory mender in one of Mr. Tan's factories. The Forgotten Workers Stranded Without a Job\nSome workers arriving here on contracts receive nothing, not even jobs. Near the airport, a crumbling cinder block house without electricity or running water is home to 47 laborers from the province of Guangdong in southeastern China.\nThe workers arrived on Saipan in December 1991 on two-year contracts as construction workers, but the jobs they had been promised disappeared. \"Now they're pretty much stranded,\" said their lawyer, Brian McMahon.\nThe South Korean businessmen who brought them here, Kim Choon Suk, says that because of a downturn in the local construction industry, he had no work for the Chinese laborers and no money to send them home.\n\"I do not write home anymore because I do not want my wife and my two children to know the truth of our terrible conditions,\" said Liu Lin Yong, a 30-year-old construction worker.\nHe leaned against one of the long sheets of plywood that Mr. Kim supplied to the workers to serve as beds. In one room, 22 of the men sleep side by side on the platforms. The toilets are flushed with rainwater, and the men bathe by swimming in the ocean.\n\"We have no money to pay for tickets to go home,\" Mr. Liu said, opening his wallet to show that it was empty. All it contained were a few photographs of his family. \"I would go home today if I had a ticket. I would run to the airport.\""}, {"text": "Development Involves Extracting a Clear Picture\n1993-10-04T05:00:00.000Z\nIn a report issued recently in London, the United Nations Children's Fund takes an imaginative new look at the problems of \"social development,\" the catchall euphemism for the evils of poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition, sickness and early death.\nEntitled \"The Progress of Nations,\" the report ranks national achievement in social development. But it makes clear that the pursuit of development is often an extremely inexact undertaking, rather like blindman's buff. And the blindfold, Unicef says, is a lack of reliable statistics.\nThe report starts with the good news. The minimum needs of most people in the Third World are at last being met. But the lack of accurate statistics is a major obstacle to further progress, Unicef says. In many Third World countries, more is known about VCR imports than about child literacy or maternal mortality.\nDeath rates of children under 5, a key indicator, are a telling example. In half the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, there are no figures more recent than 20 years old. For nearly half the countries of Asia, the latest statistics are seven years old; in Brazil and Mexico, 10 years old.\nThus, much of the allegedly precise data on which social development programs rest simply do not exist.\nProjections are often based on fragmentary and outdated surveys, at times even extrapolated from data in neighboring countries.\nAre statistics that important? Peter Adamson, the Oxford-based development specialist who edited the Unicef report, says: \"High military budgets, weak administration, corruption, debt, declining aid levels, unfair terms of trade and closed markets are all important drags on development. But the lack of statistics is different. It mists over everything.\"\nSome of the problems aggravated by the lack of statistics: Myth can defeat reality. Asked to consider child malnutrition in the Third World, many people would think of a skeletal and unclean African child. But, as the report points out, most malnutrition is invisible, most malnourished children are not hungry, and the most common cause of malnutrition is not lack of food but a combination of low birth weight, frequent illness and poor feeding practices.\nAn estimated 120 million of the 190 million underweight children in the world live in four countries: China, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Probably as many as 60 percent of the children in India and Bangladesh are malnourished, a rate twice as high as in sub-Saharan Africa.\nBut the data are rough. \"It's a scandal that figures on something as important as malnutrition are so weak,\" Mr. Adamson said. \"It's a vital indicator of the mental and physical development of the rising generation, the nation's future.\" Important disparities are hidden. When the national average itself is a rough estimate, vital information at the next level down is simply unavailable. Inequality between urban and rural, majority and minority and rich and poor remains hidden. The most glaring gap is between men and women. \"Without statistics,\" the report states, \"one of the greatest injustices and greatest inefficiencies of the modern world runs the risk of being minimized by dependence on anecdote and partial evidence.\"\nThe evidence suggests that on average, African and Asian women work 13 hours a week more than men. Women grow and market most of the Third World's family food supplies. The number of women with outside jobs contributing cash to their families has risen steeply. Yet most countries, when compiling statistics, exclude the majority of women's work. The lack of data reinforces the status quo, in which women end up with less income and opportunity, and fewer services. Good examples are not duplicated. The attack on measles launched by the World Health Organization and Unicef in the 1980s is a striking success. Although critics claim that some national statistics were inflated, projections suggest that the number of Third World children immunized against measles has risen from three in 10 to more than seven in 10, and that the annual death rate has dropped from 3 million to 1 million.\n\"National, regional and global targets were set and backed by a regional effort to get good statistics,\" Mr. Adamson said. \"A virtuous circle was created, where a clear goal, and a relatively clear view of progress toward it, boosted action that closed the gap. Unfortunately, in many areas, and not only malnutrition, the statistics are much harder to get. Achieving goals becomes much more difficult.\" - If governments and the international community want improvement, then they must be able to measure change to see whether current policies are effective. At a minimum, the basic indicators of social progress - malnutrition, primary school attendance, survival to age 5, contraceptive use rates - must be measured yearly. For now, the United Nations agencies and the World Bank publish different statistics, based on different methods of interpreting the figures.\nThis tower of Babel approach helps nobody. An international agreement for establishing and using common key indicators would enable Third World countries to begin to break the link between poverty and the lack of statistics. Child health, nutrition and education levels should become a source of national pride, or shame. Good statistics are an essential step.The writer, a former senior Unicef official, contributed this comment to the International Herald Tribune."}, {"text": "At Home Abroad; 'What Will Happen?'\n1993-02-19T05:00:00.000Z\nBangladesh has a land area small er than Wisconsin and a population of 114 million. Its numbers are growing so fast that by the year 2025 it will outstrip the present U.S. population of 250 million.\n\"What will happen to those poor people?\" M. F. Perutz of Cambridge University asked last fall in a piece in The New York Review of Books. \"Even if by some miracle of science enough food could be produced to feed them, how could they find the gainful employment needed to buy it?\"\nThe case of Bangladesh is just one among many stark examples of a profound world concern. World population is growing at a staggering rate, and almost all the increase is occurring in the poorest countries.\nThe earth's population was around one billion in the year 1800, two billion in 1920, three billion in 1960. Today it is five billion. By 2025 it is expected to be more than eight billion, and 95 percent of the increase will have been in the third world.\nProf. Paul Kennedy of Yale makes this demographic outlook -- the overwhelming of already overcrowded and poverty-stricken lands -- a main focus of his new book, \"Preparing for the Twenty-First Century.\" He makes the point that the situation will affect not just those countries but all.\nThe population explosion in South Asia, Latin America and Africa leads in all those areas to overgrazing, soil erosion and clearing of tropical rain forests. But, Professor Kennedy argues, it also tends to produce regional conflicts, global warming, flows of refugees and great pressure on developed countries to admit emigrants from the underdeveloped.\nAnyone who has visited there knows that the pressure of population is taking its toll already, in nature and human psychology, in many places. In the cities of China the crowds can be claustrophobic. In the mountains of India and Nepal people desperate for fuel have denuded forests, so topsoil is being washed into rivers and out to sea.\nIndia has about 880 million people now. It is growing so fast that experts say it will pass China as the most populous country by the year 2035, and the growth may not end until there are two billion people in India. China, with about 1.165 billion now, is expected to reach 1.5 billion.\nMexico is a telling example of population growth and its social and political consequences. It has made dramatic progress in reducing the birth rate recently. But the increase had been so great in previous years that the population is very young and will therefore continue to grow rapidly.\nWith about 85 million people now, Mexico is expected to have 150 million in 2025. In Professor Kennedy's vision, that means a terrible strain on schools, health care, the environment. It means the crowding of more and more people into \"mega-cities.\"\nAlready 20 million Mexicans live in Mexico City, many under appalling conditions. Half the country's people live without sewers and a quarter without safe water. Can anyone be surprised that, despite the country's improving economic record, many Mexicans are desperate to get into the United States?\nRational self-interest, not just humane concern, should make the rich countries do all they can to prevent overpopulation and the suffering and strife it brings.\nBut rationality has not been the mainspring of American population policy lately. Presidents Reagan and Bush shaped their policy to please the anti-abortion movement and the Christian right.\nThe Reagan Administration sabotaged the world population conference here in Mexico City in 1984 by taking the position that rapid growth was a \"neutral\" phenomenon. That was, ironically, the classic Marxist view of population growth.\nSince then the U.S. has drastically reduced aid to population-control efforts abroad, at a time when underdeveloped countries were recognizing the need for restraint. Michael S. Teitelbaum, writing about the policy in the current issue of Foreign Affairs, calls it \"self-inflicted blindness.\"\nHere is one problem that President Clinton can address quickly, without great legislative complications. He has ended the Reagan-Bush distortions of domestic policy on birth-related matters. The need for change in foreign policy is even more urgent: the need to face a reality more menacing in the long run than just about any on earth."}, {"text": "Article 446793 -- No Title\n1993-11-05T05:00:00.000Z\nAbdul B. Khan took enough pride in the Afghan-Persian restaurant he opened in April to give it his own name. And he made sure the restaurant lived up to the name.\nThe pride is evident in the simple but neat 28-seat storefront dining room, with its rich red carpet and single red carnation on each small table. One long mirrored wall helps brighten the otherwise dim room. The other long wall is adorned with small, handsome Persian rugs. It is also evident in the sweetly attentive service, in which a waiter offers to go down the block in a cold rain to buy beer. (Khan has no liquor license.) And it is evident in Mr. Khan himself, who not only does all the cooking but also makes frequent trips to the dining room to make sure all is well.\nThe food at Khan, a mixture of Middle Eastern dishes with accents from Mr. Khan's native Bangladesh, is reminiscent of Pamir, the Upper East Side restaurant where he spent 10 years cooking before opening Khan. Dinner begins with a basket of excellent flatbread flavored with caraway seeds, like a focaccia given a Middle Eastern twist. The potato turnover ($2.95) is another delicious analogue, ground potatoes mixed with onions, herbs and spices and pan-fried like an Eastern European potato pancake but served with a tart yogurt sauce rather than apple sauce or sour cream.\nKadu ($2.95), a side dish, can be an unusual appetizer. The sauteed pumpkin topped with yogurt and a mild meat sauce tastes like a savory pumpkin pie. The falafel ($3.25) were crisp, light and greaseless, and were served with a huge spread of cuminy baba gannouj. The meat-and-vegetable soup ($2.95), a rich, complex tomato broth thickened by yogurt, was marred by canned vegetables.\nShirin palaw ($9.95), chunks of tender lamb under a mound of saffron-flavored rice full of almonds, pistachios and orange strips, is one of the most popular main courses, Mr. Khan said. It is best when the meat and the rice are eaten together; otherwise the rice by itself seems too sweet. Couscous ($9.50) was fluffy and fresh, topped with chunks of boneless chicken in a nicely peppery tomato sauce.\nKebab is grilled but not dry, served with a huge portion of long-grain brown rice and grilled vegetables ($9.50 chicken, $9.95 beef, $10.50 lamb). When Mr. Khan, checking on our table, was told that the seasoning was a little tame, he darted away and came back with a little pitcher of searing hot sauce and a dish of sumac, a tart Middle Eastern spice, which livened things up considerably. He ought to set them out as a matter of course.\nDessert is traditional but no afterthought. Rice pudding ($2.95) is smooth and very sweet, flavored with ground almonds and pistachios and lemon. Best is a slice of the sensual baklava ($2.95), very nutty and syrupy.\nKhan is on Amsterdam Avenue several blocks north of a strip of trendy restaurants. No matter. Pride conveys an inner strength that transcends location.\nKhan Restaurant\n564 Amsterdam Avenue, at 87th Street, Manhattan, (212) 721-8700.\nBest dishes: Potato turnover, kadu, falafel, shirin palaw, couscous, kebab, baklava.\nPrice range: $11 to $18.\nCredit cards: All major cards.\nHours: 4:30 to 11 P.M. Mondays through Fridays, noon to 11 P.M. Saturdays and Sundays.\nWheelchair access: Entrance and dining room on one level; bathroom is very narrow."}, {"text": "Kigali Journal; Refugees Trying to Flee a War Settle for Limbo\n1993-07-08T05:00:00.000Z\nLess than six miles from Rwanda's capital, thousands of makeshift huts have encroached into the lush green fields and eucalyptus groves, digging into the steep hillsides like a gaping brown wound.\nPatched together with leaves, saplings and plastic sheeting, the tiny huts huddle shoulder to shoulder. The mud is as slick as ice when it rains, the open latrines draw clouds of black flies, and ragged children play in the dirt, their only activity.\nIn February hundreds of thousands of Rwandans took refuge here, fleeing a civil war that has gradually pushed them out of their homes in the north. For some, it is the third camp they have fled to in three years, each move marking a deeper foray into Rwandan territory by the guerrillas.\n\"Look at us, we live like cows,\" said Francois Nsenaiyumva, a 39-year-old farmer who fled his home in 1990 with his wife and five children. \"We are so tired. We only have maize to eat, sometimes only once a day, some days not at all. There is no work here. All day long, we just sit and wait. And peace never comes.\" Ration of Handouts\nLike Mr. Nsenaiyumva, Rwanda itself is in limbo, its fabric torn apart by the civil war. A cease-fire in March lured several thousand families back to their homes in a demilitarized zone, but they live without food or livelihood, surviving mostly on weekly Red Cross food handouts.\nYearlong peace talks between the Government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front broke down at the end of June, and the will to negotiate evaporated. Now Rwandans, particularly the nearly one million displaced Rwandans, remain pawns in a three-year conflict that is rooted in ethnic hatreds but spurred on by political ambitions and modern weapons.\n\"There is an immense production loss for the whole country,\" said Walter Stocker, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, which coordinates the distribution of 12,000 tons of food a month to the refugees from its Rwandan headquarters in Kigali, the capital.\n\"Sixty percent of the total agricultural production was in the north,\" Mr. Stocker said. \"Now the Rwandan Patriotic Front is holding a territory without a population and on the other side there is a population without a territory. War Serves as Catalyst\nThe war, Western diplomats say, served as a catalyst in transforming a one-party dictatorship into a multiparty system. Now for this agricultural mountain nation roughly half the size of Switzerland, overcoming the present standoff and achieving peace and unity hinges on a complex web of proposals and agreements.\nIt would temporarily involve United Nations and Organization of African Unity troops and divide the country into areas controlled by the rebels, the O.A.U. and the Government as well as create a neutral zone around the capital. If agreed on, all this in turn would eventually lead to national elections and a democratically elected government.\nRwanda, with nearly 8 million inhabitants in its 10,169 square miles, is the second most densely populated country in the world after Bangladesh. Every bit of arable land is cultivated.\nIt is a fertile land of sharply defined hills, steep slopes and deep valleys, a quilted carpet of different shades of green delineating the fields of cassava, maize, beans and banana trees. There are no villages, each farmer owing loyalty first to his family and then to his \"hill.\" Life has changed little over the centuries, and the majority of the population remain subsistence farmers.\nFor the moment, Rwanda survives amid deep regional divisions between north and south as well as between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups. The Tutsi minority ruled over the Hutu majority until a rebellion in 1959.\nThe Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front, a highly organized guerrilla force of about 10,000 to 12,000 based on the Ugandan border, first attacked in 1990 but were repulsed. They attacked again in 1992 but their greatest inroads were in February 1993, when the rebels broke a cease-fire and drove almost all the way to Kigali, seizing major towns along the way, before agreeing to another cease-fire and the creation of a demilitarized zone that in places is more than 20 miles wide. 20 Years of One-Man Rule\nOnce a monarchy, Rwanda has been a mostly Hutu Government headed by President Juvenal Habyarimana since a coup in 1973. The process for political change was accelerated by the war, and in 1991 a multiparty constitution came into force.\nThe Rwandan Patriotic Front presents itself as a democratic and multi-ethnic movement. But since the civil war broke out in 1990, ethnic violence has flared, further polarizing the country.\n\"It used to be very simple in Rwanda,\" said Gaspard Karemera, director of Imbaga, the monthly magazine with the largest circulation in Rwanda. \"It was a dictatorship, a hierarchy from top to bottom with one set of rigid laws.\n\"The Government is a group of people that fight among each other. You massacre your opponents on one hand and talk liberalism on the other. That's not democracy.\""}, {"text": "Betting the Farm on the Capricious Consumer\n1993-01-15T05:00:00.000Z\nThis is the time of year when the Garden State's vegetable farmers begin their spring planting, setting out uncounted thousands of seeds under acres of greenhouse glass. Midweek found many of them at the annual New Jersey Vegetable Growers' Association at the Taj Mahal casino, where the talk was about the annual gamble that absorbs them all: what will the grocery shoppers want this year?\nWill it be the slender Oriental eggplant or the imposing white ghost buster, only two of the six eggplants and 75 varieties of vegetables that Robert J. Matarazzo is starting as greenhouse seedlings, to be transplanted to his fields in Belvidere in April. Should John Formisani put out more escarole or endive this year, or should it be radicchio or arugula, to make up for five and a half acres of romaine lettuce he plowed under last fall, when the price at the Vineland Produce Auction fell so low that it barely covered the cost of the carton? Will anise be this year's star herb, the next cilantro, which was the next basil?\n\"We're not like General Motors,\" said Mr. Formisani, who with his sons John and Michael farms 200 acres in Buena -- \"Bewner\" to locals -- in Atlantic County. \"We can't just jack up the price,\" he said. \"If people won't buy it, we can just get what we can or plow it under.\" He's going with the anise.\nThere are 1,500 vegetable farmers in New Jersey, planting perhaps 45,000 acres total and drawing about $100 million in sales, said Steven Reiners, an extension agent at Cook College of Rutgers University, the agricultural school. That is a fraction of the number up until World War II, when New Jersey vegetables were on the summer and fall tables from Washington to Boston. New Marketing Equation\nToday hardy varieties and faster transportation let supermarkets buy from California and Mexico practically year round. New Jersey's biggest agricultural yield is no longer food, but nursery plants -- shrubs, trees, turf and flowers for the suburbanites who have displaced so much of the state's farmland.\nThose suburbanites have also changed the marketing equation -- for the better, some farmers say. Their fondness for road-side stands gives farmers here an important outlet at a time when the big commercial distributors and supermarket chains increasingly rely on long-term supply contracts from the the big farm states to the west and south. At one time, Mr. Reiners said, the Campbell Soup Company bought nearly every tomato grown in New Jersey; now it is not even part of the picture for growers in the state.\nBut farm stand customers are also keen on the new, which has forced vegetable growers to shift from stressing yield, or bushels per acre, to profitability, a slippery equation with growing costs and market demands as chief variables.\nW. Scott Ellis, this year's president of the Vegetable Growers' Association of New Jersey, has taken the opposite route, away from market-chasing diversity to the relative predictability of commodity farming. He will put about 150 acres of his farm in Mercer and Burlington Counties in sweet corn, which will go entirely to other farmers' road side markets. The other 750 acres will go to soybeans. Impact of Pesticides\n\"I couldn't do what Bob does,\" Mr. Ellis said, speaking of Mr. Matarazzo cornucopian crop diversity.\nBut then, as president, Mr. Ellis has to worry about other clouds on the horizon for small farmers.\nIn June, the National Academy of Sciences is due to release the results of a study on the impact of agricultural pesticides on the health of children, a report that farmers fear will produce tighter restrictions on what can be used to treat crops.\n\"People think that pesticides are a bad thing,\" Mr. Ellis said in an interview, \"but the reason it only takes 2 percent of the population to feed the other 98 percent in this country is because of pesticides.\"\nAs for the vaunted willingness of enlightened consumers to accept blemished produce that has been untouched by bug killers, the farmers only laugh.\n\"The polls always report that consumers would be willing to accept blemished fruit if no chemicals have been used on it,\" Mr. Reiners said, \"but when you put in on the shelves, they won't buy it.\"\nFinally, the farmers were hoping the New Jersey Legislature would exempt them from the state's $5.05 minimum wage, adopted last year, which is 60 cents an hour higher than farm wages in Delaware, Pennsylvania and New York.\nBut Mian Akbar, a farm labor contractor who specializes in procuring Bangladeshi immigrants to tend and harvest crops, said the state's high minium wage was a good thing.\n\"I have been specializing in apple-pickers in the mid-Hudson valley,\" said Mr. Akbar, who receives between 3 and 4 percent of the total payroll from the farmer as his fee. He recruited 125 workers in the 18 months he has headed the West Point Company of South Ozone Park, Queens.\n\"But when I can offer $5.05 an hour in New Jersey, that is much better for the workers, and much better for me, to be here in New Jersey.\""}, {"text": "Mud, Sweat and Tears\n1993-10-03T05:00:00.000Z\nWORKERSAn Archaeology of the Industrial Age.By Sebastiao Salgado.Illustrated. 400 pp. New York:Aperture. $100.\nTHE grimy face of a turbaned man, pickax on shoulder, stares sternly from the cover of Sebastiao Salgado's extraordinary book \"Workers: An Archaeology of the Industrial Age.\" He is a coal miner from Bihar state in India, earning the equivalent of $1.30 a day. Women also work in the mines, but it is now illegal for them to do this at night. Contrast such images with other photographs in the book, those of one of the latest feats in engineering: the building of the 31-mile-long Channel Tunnel from England to France; the very idea would have horrified Englishmen in Napoleonic times, or even 50 years ago. The tunnel, we learn, is privately financed with $300 billion. It is true that large foreign investments are reaching Bihar, but these have not prevented fires from burning there underground, dating back to 1940. Each miner walks with death.\n\"Workers\" is a book on many levels. Mr. Salgado, a photojournalist, is famous for his harrowing photographs of the Sahel famine in Africa. There are several photographs here almost as horrifying. There are also others of great beauty: of landscapes, machinery, faces -- many faces, beautiful in their dedication to work, their pride and dignity, even when in utter exhaustion -- and figures worthy of Caravaggio or Michelangelo. Some workers seem to be enjoying themselves -- the searchers for shellfish in Galicia in northwest Spain, for instance, the distillers of perfume essence in the island of Reunion in the Indian Ocean, the cocoa farmers in Brazil, even the lone girl in the huge textile factory in the central Asian republic of Kazakhstan. In Sicily the slaughtering of tuna has a quasi-religious significance. Yet in all those cases there are shadows lurking, the result of falls in demand, threatened layoffs, pollution, price setting by consumers in rich countries that means lower wages for the producers in the third world.\nThe purpose of the book may be seen in its subtitle. There are still those who work with their hands in preindustrial conditions. But, as Mr. Salgado says in his introduction, \"Concepts of production and efficiency are changing, and, with them, the nature of work. The highly industrialized world is racing ahead and stumbling over the future. In reality, this telescoping of time is the result of the work of people throughout the world, although in practice it may benefit few.\"\nExtensive captions, printed in a separate pamphlet that accompanies the book, put each photograph in its historical and geographical context. We learn, for instance, why scrapping ships is so important to the Bangladesh economy -- Mr. Salgado estimates that some 100,000 people draw their living from the industry. The sequence of pictures, showing emaciated men hacking away like dwarfs in this graveyard of grounded monsters, or trudging with heavy ropes through mud, is one of the strangest in the book. The metal obtained in the demolition process is used for making domestic utensils and farming tools, even bracelets. \nSeveral thousand miles to the west, out on platforms in the Caspian Sea, there stands a whole manmade town belonging to Azerbaijan, known as Oil Rocks, with 125 miles of streets and a population of 4,000. Sophisticated technology in this case insures that the environment is unpolluted and that there are no gas odors or oil slicks. But in spite of technology, the steelworkers of Dunkirk in France and of Zaporozhye in Ukraine still toil near caldrons of liquid fire, in greater danger than even the coal miners of Bihar. \nMonochrome is the ideal medium for the depiction of themes so essentially sculptural, even if we miss the bright colors of the saris of Gujarati women carrying baskets of stone on their heads for the Sardar Sarovar Dam in India. In Rajasthan, women help to dig a 560-mile canal through the desert, still wearing their dowries of multicolored necklaces and bangles. The photographs of la Mattanza, the massacre of tuna near Favignana in Sicily, are magnificent, a tribute to muscular strength and achievement, but we are spared the fact that in the process the sea becomes red with frothing blood. A sequence at a slaughterhouse in Sioux Falls, S.D., shows scores of pigs waiting to enter the death tunnel. They are then swiftly eviscerated and hung on the production line. The lot of cattle is even less enviable. It seems that they are killed by a puncture in the forehead after being strung up. The last photographs are of machines that turn out the end product: hot dogs wrapped in plastic.\nOn first opening \"Workers\" at random I was shocked and moved by an exhausted figure, coated in mud and struggling up a ladder under a heavy load. I found that this was from a series about the Serra Pelada goldfield in Brazil. Swarms of thousands of desperate, doomed men in filthy rags work there, driven by greed or sheer poverty, as if in a giant muddy and disturbed ants' nest, hundreds of feet deep. It is hard to decide whether to feel contempt or pity for this self-inflicted Hades.\nBut there is no confusion of emotions when looking at the sulfur gatherers of Java, not so far from the happy world of tourists in Bali. This must be among the very worst jobs in the world. Amid clouds of poisonous fumes, after a long climb through the rain forest, these men struggle down 2,000 feet into the volcano's crater, loading chunks of the yellow stuff into baskets, from the edge of a bubbling pool. They earn the equivalent of $3.50 a day, nearly half the rate of 10 years ago. Sulfur is used in sugar distillation, among other things, in food and wine preservation and in the spraying of vines.\nYet even this last ordeal cannot compare with the horror of firefighters from Texas and Calgary, Alberta, battling to cap the flames of the oil wells in Kuwait after the gulf war. These pictures will endure as classics of photography. Mr. Salgado's comment sets the tone of much of what he has been aiming to say in the book: \"No Kuwaiti was in charge of the work. Only the real owners of Kuwait's oil were participating, only the companies that control the world's oil. It took a war to show Kuwaitis what their own treasure looked like.\""}, {"text": "LONG ISLAND JOURNAL\n1993-10-17T05:00:00.000Z\nSunday Driving\nTO take a spin in Barry Bienstock's car, you have to share the front seat with a fire extinguisher. And buckling up for safety means being strapped into a harness with so many clasps that it is as if you are in a fighter jet. But then for those who drive four-cylinder cars, Mr. Bienstock's Ferrari is like a jet. In seconds it was going more than 100 miles an hour.\n\"It's not the going fast that I like, it's the turns,\" Mr. Bienstock said, demonstrating one at what seemed to be the speed of light. His passenger mentioned something about motion sickness. \"You have that problem?\" he asked as the road curved and the car swerved. \"I get it, too.\"\nFortunately neither got it that day. Mr. Bienstock, of Woodmere, spent the entire day driving -- expertly, one must add -- his Ferrari at speeds that would make a highway patrol officer salivate. He and 100 other Ferrari owners had journeyed to the Bridgehampton Race Circuit for a meet sponsored by Steven Kessler Motors of Manhattan and the Northeast chapter of the Ferrari Club of America.\n\"Ferrari owners are members of a family,\" said Mr. Kessler, who has sold Ferraris to Mike Tyson, Jon Bon Jovi and Mr. Bienstock. As a treat for his family Mr. Kessler and the club rented a track for the weekend. \"Everybody gets to experience the thrill of the throttle,\" he said.\nThe problem with owning a Ferrari in the metropolitan New York region is where to drive it the way it was built to be driven. \"What good is having a car that can go 200 miles an hour on Main Street in Huntington?\" asked Steve Bernstein, who lives in Huntington and who owns three Ferraris. \"At least on the track you can go fast. You can't on the street.\" At least not without getting a serious ticket.\nWith no radar traps in sight, Mr. Bernstein was driving his red Ferrari at 180 miles an hour. He was a hood scoop behind the red Ferrari of Joe Rosen of Patchogue. Mr. Rosen, director of the Northeast chapter, owns five Ferraris. Most are red. \"It's the traditional color,\" he said. \"Probably 90 percent of Ferraris are red.\"\nThat didn't help spectators like John Fasano and Dawn Delplato of Hauppauge, who were at the track to see Mr. Fasano's brother Ralph, of Lattingtown, in his Ferrari. \"We're looking for his car,\" Mr. Fasano said. \"It's red.\"\nMr. Bienstock was looking for his wife, Ilana. She is the treasurer of the Northeast chapter of Ferrari owners. Maybe she was out on the track. \"She wouldn't get into the car on a bet,\" Mr. Bienstock said. \"Handling a car is not her thing. She likes handling money better.\"\nJohn Norwood of Southampton wasn't handling anything. His two Ferraris were with his mechanic, he said. It seems the No. 1 rule of owning a Ferrari is to have a personal mechanic.\n\"No,\" Mr. Bienstock said. \"The No. 1 rule of owning a Ferrari is to make lots of money so you can afford the rest of the rules.\" Language of Poetry X 50\nHow intellectual are the students and professors at the State University at Stony Brook? Many attended a poetry reading where poems were read in 50 languages with no translations.\n\"There were going to be translations,\" said the organizer, Prof. Jack Ludwig. \"But we had so many people sign up to read we didn't have time for the translations.\" Which made for an interesting evening of poetry.\nAbout 90 percent of the audience could not understand 90 percent of the poetry. \"But that's O.K.,\" Professor Ludwig said. \"It's sounds we're interested in, not words.\"\nIt was a poetry-reading happening, just like in the 60's. All that were missing were fingers clicking and black berets. Ah, there sat a black beret on the head of Dr. Dorothy Hurley. Dr. Hurley was to read a poem that her husband wrote for her as an engagement present. Her husband, Dr. E. Anthony Hurley, would be reading a poem in the Bajan dialect. \"I'm Barbadian,\" he said. \"I'm not sure there are any other Bajan speakers here.\"\nDr. Luigi Fontanella spoke Italian. \"I'm from Rome,\" he said. \"And Harvard.\" At Stony Brook, Dr. Fontanella teaches Italian literature. In Italian? \"Is there any other way?\" he asked.\nHe was reading in Italian, \"because the Italian language is the most musical language in the world,\" he said. He expected the listeners to understand through the rhythm of the words.\nMahrina Chowdhury of Bangladesh hoped to understand through the readers' gestures. The only problem was that the readers had no hands free to make gestures. Except for Fawad Syed of Pakistan. He memorized a love poem in Urdu. Memorizing love poems makes sense when you're in college. \"I've memorized 300 to 400 of them,\" he said.\nThe opening of the Iliad was read in Greek. Haiku was read in Japanese, and one poem had musical accompaniment. Playing the slide trombone was Julie Josephson. Reading the poem was the author, a student, Erik Pihel. \"My poem is about a broken relationship,\" Mr. Pihel said.\n\"I improvise on what he's saying,\" Miss Josephson said.\nA mutual friend, Tim, had introduced them. Mr. Pihel probably uses other musical instruments for other poems. \"No,\" he said. \"It's always the slide trombone. For some reason Julie's the only one who's interested in doing this.\" Elementary Shopping\nThe mothers of Bellmore had accompanied their children on many school trips. But this one was their first to King Kullen. \"With the budget cuts, I guess they had to be creative,\" said Jackie Wright, a mother of a sixth grader at Winthrop Elementary School.\n\"Next week it may be the bagel store,\" said Vicky Butti, another mother. Next week who knows? This week all that the principal, Dr. Myra Lieblich, cared about was surviving a walking field trip with the entire fourth, fifth and sixth grades. It was all for the sake of nutrition. If you want to learn how to eat well, you have to go where the food is. In Bellmore that's not a farm. That's a supermarket.\n\"We're doing this to let the kids know they can make choices,\" Dr. Lieblich said, \"in your food, whatever. We want them to know they can have control over their lives.\"\nIris Davis was trying to keep control over her shopping cart as more than 150 nutritionists to be surged around her. They were in a scavenger hunt. The assignment was to find the food with the lowest fat content. It was not in Ms. Davis's cart. She had three caramel-covered candy apples. \"Oh, those are for my kids,\" she said. \"I buy yogurt for myself.\"\nYogurt is good, Marlissa Brown told the students. Next to a sale on lemon meringue pies, Ms. Brown and other graduate nutrition students from Long Island University taught about labeling and the need to choose food with no more than 3 grams of fat per 100 calories. \"It's important to eat fruit and vegetables,\" Ms. Brown said. \"No junk food, right?\"\n\"My favorite food is a Snickers candy bar,\" a fifth grader, Colin Gomes, said. It was going to be a hard sell. One person intent on doing the selling was the Winthrop health teacher, Ann Smillie. Ms. Smillie wore her jogging outfit on the supermarket field trip. This was a woman who cared about fitness and nutrition. \"We're here because it's one thing to teach it in the classroom,\" she said. \"It's another to put it into practice. We do the same thing with sex education.\"\nWatching the students were Donald and Althea Darnay of Bellmore. In their cart were healthy items, Mr. Darnay said, like Cool Whip Lite. What would he be putting it on? \"Oh, apple pie, ice cream,\" he said.\n\"I try to watch his diet,\" Mrs. Darnay said.\n\"I watch what I eat,\" Mr. Darnay said. \"I never keep my eyes closed.\""}, {"text": "NEWS SUMMARY\n1993-05-23T05:00:00.000Z\nInternational 3-17 JOINT STRATEGY ON BOSNIA After months of dispute and vacillation, the United States, Russia and key European allies agreed on a joint strategy to contain the fighting in Bosnia and to protect Muslim enclaves that remain. 1 FROM THE SERBS, SMUGNESS Serbian nationalists appear to have concluded that the only force that threatened their hold on 70 per cent of this former Yugoslav republic, NATO firepower, is not going to be used against them. 12 Officials say Serbia is showing it no longer fears intervention. 13 CAMBODIA, FEARFUL, SET TO VOTE As Cambodians prepared for an election after decades of oppression, the threat of violence grew as Khmer Rouge rebels were blamed for a raid that killed two Chinese peacekeepers. 1 China shielded the Khmer Rouge in the Security Council. 10 SLAVERY REPORTED IN BRAZIL A difficult economy has led to a surge in reports of slavery in Brazil, where farm workers are often kept captive by owners through threats and exorbitant charges for food and housing. 3 Visiting diplomats challenge hosts over arrests of Tibetans. 11 United Nations report highlights its goal of improving people's lives. 14 Agreement will return 50,000 people who fled Bangladesh. 15 Britons gather to debate the future of the monarchy. 9 Asian nations have begun talks on regional security. 16 United Nations warns that money to aid Kurds in Iraq is running out. 8 United States envoys arrive in Haiti for talks on peacekeeping. 7 National 18-28 CLINTON ATTACKS SENATE FOES President Clinton accused Democratic Senators who have opposed his budget and tax package of protecting wealthy special interests and buckling under to the oil lobby. 1 The President's latest woes cropped up on a visit to New Hampshire. 21 LOOKS LIKE AN OLD LIBERAL Political memo: \"New Democrats\" who thought President Clinton embodied a more conservative approach now suspect that he may really be an old-time liberal. 20 CLINTON FACES SPLIT ON HEALTH News analysis: President Clinton is seeking a middle ground in the health debate to avoid choosing between his wife and advisers. 20 DAIRIES RIGGED MILK BIDS Investigators say big dairies in at least 20 states have conspired to rig bids on milk products sold to schools and military bases. 1 TRIAL WATCHERS IMITATE JURY Spectators in the court gallery at the Jeffrey Masson-Janet Malcolm libel suit have taken an active interest in the case, arguing among themselves during breaks. 18 GAY GROUPS ARGUE TACTICS Leading gay and lesbian figures trying to lift the ban on homosexuals in the military are split in their reactions to Administration and Congressional actions. 18 PILOTS TRACE OWN COURSE In order to save time and money, pilots follow their own routes rather than those mapped by the Federal Aviation Administration. 24 REGION NOTES WORKERS' LOT A failed strike among Pennsylvania's mushroom farm workers has called unaccustomed attention to their plight. 26 A Little League game in California ended in a homicide. 18 Metro 29-39 THE WEAPON OF CHOICE At a time when so many boys and girls see their neighborhoods as places of hovering violence, officials say more of them are routinely hiding blades in their pockets and knapsacks. 1 OLD BURIAL GROUNDS STIR DEBATE The extraordinary effort to protect the graves of black New Yorkers in forsaken burial grounds in Manhattan has focused attention on the scores of other cemeteries lying beneath the city -- from Washington Square to La Guardia Airport. 1 MAN SOUGHT IN SLAYING OF BOY Detectives investigating the death of a boy whose body was found in a trash compactor in Brooklyn were searching for a man who lived in Jersey City with the child and his adoptive mother, officials said. 29 FRINGE GROUPS FLOURISH ON CABLE Originally designed as a kind of electronic soapbox, public-access cable channels have become a growing forum for preachers of racial and religious animosities, including those who encourage violence. 29 Memorial Day has not arrived and Giuliani is running hard. 29 Poll lends credence to the view of New York as a city of two souls. 30 Children explore new vistas through the Fresh Air Fund. 35 Obituaries 38"}, {"text": "Freedom Under Arrest -- A special report; Burmese Loosen Up; Outsiders Are Skeptical\n1993-01-02T05:00:00.000Z\nLate last fall, a dark sedan carrying a group of olive-uniformed army officers raced down University Avenue in Yangon toward the home of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the dissident who won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize for her campaign to bring democracy to Myanmar, the nation once called Burma.\nAs a group of startled neighbors looked on, the officers stepped from the car in front of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's lakeside villa and ordered laborers to begin rolling up the long coils of barbed wire that had been placed there the year before.\n\"One soldier told me that there was no need for the barbed wire anymore, that things were changing in Burma,\" said a driver for a foreign embassy who passes the house each day.\nBut like so many of the measures taken by Myanmar's military Government since April, when it began a liberalization campaign intended to end Myanmar's standing as an international pariah, the removal of the barbed wire from outside No. 56 University Avenue was a purely cosmetic change.\nMrs. Aung San Suu Kyi remains trapped inside the villa, a political prisoner now in her fourth year under house arrest. Her husband says she has been refusing food, though the Government denies it.\nForeign diplomats in Yangon, the gracious if decaying capital city that was once called Rangoon, say they welcome some of the Government's recent moves, in particular the release of hundreds of political prisoners, the end of military tribunals in civilian criminal cases, and the lifting of an 11 P.M.-to-4 A.M. curfew.\n[ The Government announced on Friday that it was reducing the sentences of prisoners convicted since 1988, The Associated Press reported. It said the order reduces death sentences to life imprisonment and any terms of more than 10 years to 10 years. ]\nThe diplomats say the once unbearable tension in this nation of 43 million people has eased, especially in Yangon. But the Government's hope in making these changes is that they will attract new international aid and investment, which came to a halt after a 1988 crackdown on democracy demonstrators in which as many as 3,000 people are said to have been gunned down in the streets. Japan, long Myanmar's largest foreign donor, has signaled its eagerness to resume development aid.\nBut foreign diplomats -- and the Burmese who are willing to risk speaking to a visitor to Myanmar -- say the changes offer little hope that the generals who took power from a civilian government 30 years ago will ever agree to give up control.\nThe military has refused to accept the results of a 1990 election in which a democratic coalition allied with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi won an overwhelming victory. A carefully stage-managed constitutional convention being convened on Jan. 9 is expected to enshrine the military's dominant role in the Government, apparently beneath a facade of civilian control.\n\"Most of these reforms have to be considered cosmetic until the junta does much, much more to prove otherwise,\" said an Asian diplomat. Democracy Movement Crushed\nThe democracy movement in Myanmar has been crushed. Hundreds of the junta's opponents have been released from prison this year, but many more are still in custody, including a large number of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's most trusted supporters.\n\"Opposition? You can see for yourself that there is no organized opposition,\" said U Thakin Chid, a leader of the League for Democracy and Peace, a political party involved in the failed democracy movement in the late 1980's that has been banned.\nHuman rights organizations say the Government continues routinely to torture and even to murder political opponents. And the junta's persecution, they say, is not only politically motivated. More than 200,000 Muslims from the western province of Arakan have fled into Bangladesh over the last two years, saying they were the targets of a savage anti-Muslim campaign conducted by the Tatamaw, the Burmese armed forces. Foreigners Invited Back\nThe junta, insisting that it has been smeared by human rights groups and foreign governments that have no knowledge of what actually goes on in Myanmar, has opened the country to large numbers of foreign journalists for the first time in more than two years.\nIts spokesmen say the junta has remained in power to hold together a nation that has always been a uneasy federation of distinct and often feuding ethnic groups. The Government continues to wage a fierce war on its eastern border against rebel Karens, members of a Thai-Chinese ethnic group from Kayah State who have been struggling for greater autonomy since Burma gained independence from Britain in 1948.\n\"All of the attributes you see in the breakup of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia are here,\" said Col. Ye Htut, a Government spokesman. \"There is a feeling among the people here that, if the need arises, the military should step in, must step in.\"\nBut it is not a feeling that reaches across the capital to the Hi Cafe, a tea shop across from the leafy campus of Yangon University. An arts student in her mid-20's put down her tea cup and peered over her shoulder to make sure no one else was listening.\n\"The people want to control their own lives, but there is almost no hope for us,\" she whispered. \"The Tatamaw has all the power. Our true leaders in the democracy movement are still in prison. My country is not important enough so that other big nations will come to help save us.\" The Thaw A Strongman Steps Down\nThe slight thaw of Myanmar's political spring began on April 23, when the junta announced that its leader, Gen. Saw Maung, an architect of the 1988 crackdown, had stepped down because of what was described as ill health. General Saw Maung, who had babbled incoherently at public appearances in his final days in power, was widely believed to be going mad.\nWithin days of his departure, the Government announced that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi would be allowed family visits for the first time in two years, and that political prisoners who posed no national security threat would be released.\nMore than 700 people have been freed since then, including former Prime Minister U Nu, a leader in the pro-democracy movement who had lived under house arrest since 1990. Now 85 and ailing, U Nu is no longer seen as being capable of challenging to the junta.\nIn September, the Government ended the nationwide curfew that had been in effect since 1988 and announced an end to the use of military tribunals for civilians, a move that would restore at least a semblance of due process in civilian criminal cases. Imported Beer and Jeans\nForeign diplomats say that while fear is never far from the surface in Yangon, the mood in the capital -- a city of hulking British colonial buildings set side by side against the delicate gilded spires of ancient pagodas -- has not been so relaxed since 1988.\nBefore the curfew was lifted, anyone caught after 11 at night on the streets of Yangon or any other Burmese city faced arrest and a prison term.\nIn a liberalizing measure that startled many of Yangon's longtime residents, the Government decided in lifting the curfew to create a Western-style nightlife in the capital and sanctioned the opening of nightclubs.\nThree have opened recently on the giant rooftop of the Theingyi Market, overlooking the city's most sacred landmark, the golden bell-shaped stupa of the Shwedagon Pagoda. By the puritanical standards of Myanmar, the entertainment is downright racy.\nAt the Ambassador Restaurant, young women female entertainers dressed in calf-length skirts or snug jeans parade down a rectangular runway, belting out the Burmese lyrics of Western pop songs, most of mid-70's vintage. Burmese men drunk on imported beer step up to the runway to drape the singers with metal-foil garlands or to offer them American dollar bills.\nWhile the economy has been devastated by decades of rigid central planning, Myanmar still has a substantial middle class. What wealth there is in the country comes principally from the sale of teak and gems and other natural resources, from the thriving black market, and from the illicit production of opium. Myanmar remains the world's largest producer of opium, and foreign diplomats worry that senior Burmese military commanders are profiting from the trade.\nMany Burmese can afford the new nightclubs and can pay for the consumer goods that the Government only in last few years has allowed to be imported into Myanmar in bulk. Japanese- and Korean-brand televisions and electronic equipment crowd the shelves of dozens of shops in Yangon and in the northern city of Mandalay. Even some small villages have video shops, where bootleg videocassettes of Burmese and foreign films are available for rent.\nA Western diplomat in Yangon said the junta \"appears to want to ply the intelligensia and the middle class -- the two groups that were behind the democracy movement and can cause the most trouble -- with luxuries that will make their lives more pleasant, just so long as they forget about democracy.\"\nThe air of menace has been notably reduced for foreign visitors and diplomats living here. They are no longer confronted with large dual-language signboards in Yangon that once trumpeted ugly propaganda in English and Burmese.\n\"Anyone Who Gets Riotous, Destructive and Unruly Is Our Enemy,\" a billboard a few hundred yards from Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's house proclaimed. A sign just outside the United States Embassy said, \"Down With Minions of Colonialism.\"\nThe billboards are still up. They have simply been repainted so that only the Burmese-language version remains. \"We Burmese can still read these signs,\" said a barefoot, red-robed monk near the Shwedagon Pagoda. \"The threat is still there for the Burmese.\" The Compromise Opposition Party Redecorates\nThe junta's success in crushing the democracy movement is perhaps best understood in a visit to the ramshackle headquarters of the National League for Democracy, the political party that won the overwhelming victory in the 1990 election.\nPosters and photographs of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi that had once lined the offices have been ripped down, exposing the peeling paint beneath.\nShe was ousted from the party in December 1991 in what many opposition politicians are certain was a deal with the Government that allowed the party to remain in existence. The party is now led by U Aung Shwe, a former army brigadier who has been more accommodating to the Government.\n\"I'm sorry, but you must leave here,\" said a Burmese man, obviously embarrassed by his assignment to escort a Western visitor out of the party's offices. \"I'm sure you understand our situation, why we cannot grant interviews now.\"\nAsked why the pictures of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi had been taken down, his smile dropped. \"We cannot discuss that personage,\" he said. A Prison Wing All Their Own\nMany of the party's former leaders, including several who were elected to Parliament in 1990, are believed to be in a special political-crime wing of the notorious Insein Prison, outside Yangon. Of the party's members freed from prison in recent months, most have not returned to politics.\nMyanmar's universities, once the center of the democracy movement, are under rigid surveillance. The universities opened in August after having been shuttered for most of the last four years.\nWhen students and professors returned to Yangon University, they were startled to discover that thick brick walls had been built to separate the different academic departments on campus. \"They want to make sure we cannot run away if they want to shoot at us again,\" an engineering student said.\nBefore they were allowed to resume teaching, the university's professors were required to attend Maoist-style re-education camps where, faculty members said, they were instructed to report on the activities of \"politically questionable students.\" Torture and Death\nIn a report in October, Amnesty International estimated that at least 1,600 political prisoners were still being detained in Myanmar, including a 14-year-old boy imprisoned for putting up democracy posters in a school.\nThe junta, it said, has not shaken its \"deeply entrenched disregard for human rights\" and continues routinely to torture and carry out extrajudicial killing of its opponents.\nCommon tortures, it said, include \"the helicopter,\" in which a victim is suspended by the wrists or feet from a ceiling fixture and spun, sometimes for hours, and the \"iron road,\" in which an iron or bamboo rod is rolled up and down a victim's shins until the skin is shredded.\nColonel Ye Htut, the junta spokesman, said that the allegations of torture and Government-sanctioned killings were \"concoctions\" based on the false accounts of Burmese insurgents. He said that there are now fewer than 100 political prisoners in Myanmar prisons, and that they would be released when \"the time is right.\"\nMuslim refugees now living in squalid border camps in Bangladesh say they fled Myanmar after the army began a campaign of violent harassment, including rape and murder, motivated by its desire to create all-Buddhist communities along the border.\nThe Burmese junta says charges of a Government-sanctioned terror campaign are lies spread by Muslim fundamentalist groups in Bangladesh. Many of the refugees insist, however, that they are terrified of returning to Myanmar and would instead prefer to begin new lives in Bangladesh. The Reform Junta Is Shopping For a Constitution\nForeign diplomats say that in recent weeks the Burmese junta has quietly approached selected embassies around Yangon requesting copies of their national constitutions.\nThe Burmese generals, preparing for next month's constitutional convention in Yangon, are said to be most interested in studying the Constitutions of Indonesia, Chile, Thailand and other nations that have both a strong economy and a domineering military.\nThe junta has already announced that whatever else the new Burmese Constitution says, it will guarantee the military's hold on power. In a broadcast on Yangon Radio in October, the military said that a new constitution must insure the armed forces \"the leading role in national politics.\"\nThe generals, diplomats agree, still prefer the policies of repression and xenophobic political isolation begun in 1962, when the nation's last true civilian government was toppled in a coup led by Gen. Ne Win. The military has held effective control over the nation in the three decades since. The Burmese Way to Socialism\nGeneral Ne Win, a brutal and eccentric military commander whose circle of advisers has included numerologists and astrologers, pursued a policy he called the Burmese Way to Socialism, a path that quickly beggared what had once been one of the most prosperous colonies of the British Empire.\nGeneral Ne Win, 82, is officially retired and in May he placed a mysterious hand-written advertisement in the official Working People's Daily newspaper requesting that his portrait be removed from all government buildings. But diplomats and many Burmese believe that General Ne Win is still consulted on important Government matters.\nGen. Than Shwe, the junta's titular head, shares day-to-day authority with one of General Ne Win's proteges, Maj. Gen. Khin Nyunt, the head of military intelligence and a man much feared by the public. His title in the junta is Secretary 1.\n\"Than Shwe has a kind Burmese face -- he could be your uncle,\" said a shopkeeper in Mandalay's clamorous central market. \"But Secretary 1 has the cold eyes of a killer.\"\nWhile loyal to General Ne Win, the junta has said that it will abandon his isolationist economic policies by encouraging open markets and foreign investment.\nThe Burmese economy has fallen so far behind the miracle economies of Southeast Asia that it has more in common with the poorest nations of Africa than it does with some of its regional neighbors. The average annual household income is estimated at less than $300, and inflation for some staples like rice is nearly 100 percent a year.\nWhile the average Government salary is about $10 a month, a plump goose can easily cost $2.50, which means that many Government officials must seek second or third jobs to eat. Government employees who deal with the public commonly demand \"tea money\" -- in effect, small bribes.\nAlthough it has never proved to be of much concern to the military, malnutrition is widespread in a nation with some of Asia's richest agricultural land. The United Nations Children's Fund reported this year that than more than 10 percent of Burmese children suffered from severe malnutrition, meaning that their body weight is at least 40 percent less than it should be.\nThe military appears comfortable that for now it has crushed the political opposition. But diplomats say the junta may worry that an unreformed, stagnant economy will eventually accomplish what the democracy movement of the 1980's failed to achieve.\n\"If there's one subject that makes Burmese furious, it's food prices,\" a Western diplomat said. \"The economic pressures on the Government are not overwhelming now. But if in a year or two there is a bad rice crop and prices skyrocket, you can imagine food riots that would get out of control and turn into a popular uprising.\" The Price A Diet of Rice And Emily Bronte\nIn a nation that a generation ago was considered an educational leader in Southeast Asia, educational standards in Myanmar have collapsed. The country has bought almost no school books since 1962, when General Ne Win took power, and university science students are forced to depend on photocopies of photocopies of outdated science texts.\nBecause no modern English-language textbooks are available, secondary school students routinely learn from faded copies of \"Wuthering Heights\" -- not because Emily Bronte's mid-19th century English is appropriate for the study of the modern language, but because that is one of the few English-language books still widely available in school libraries.\nThe question of whether to resume some sort of aid to Myanmar draws an agonized response from major Western and Asian embassies in Yangon. Some diplomats argue that whatever the abominable human rights of the military, it is time to consider the resumption of development assistance to save a generation of young Burmese. Japan Sees a Market\nJapan, which provided hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the Burmese Government during the 1980's, halted new aid projects in 1988 to protest the crackdown on democracy protesters. But in part because of the urging of large Japanese corporations that see a potentially lucrative market in Myanmar, Tokyo has signaled its desire to resume aid.\n\"Do we really want a generation of Burmese who are so malnourished and so poorly educated that they will never be able to catch up with their neighbors if political change does come?\" asked a diplomat from another Asian country. \"The reforms we have seen so far from the Myanmar Government are only a start -- but they are a start.\"\nThe Japanese are reported to be urging the junta to take additional steps -- in particular, to ease the terms of confinement for Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi -- that would make Tokyo's resumption of aid more justifiable.\nFor now, the junta says Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi will stay where she is. Government spokesmen in Yangon say she has two options: to remain under house arrest indefinitely in Yangon or to leave Myanmar, with no promise that she can ever return.\nColonel Ye Htut, the junta's spokesman, said foreign governments and human rights organization were wrong to make a hero of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and to continue to isolate Myanmar as a protest over one woman's house arrest.\n\"It looks like they have more interest in one individual person than in the situation for over 40 million people,\" the colonel said. \"To the West, we ask whether one individual should be of such primary importance. To us, she has never been a matter of life and death.\""}, {"text": "Cabbies Angrily Debate Partitions\n1993-12-03T05:00:00.000Z\nOperating on three hours' sleep and six cups of coffee, Alexander Stone Dale gave the surest prescription for how taxi drivers can survive violent nights on New York City streets. \"Have the passenger drive while the cabdriver sits in the back seat with a 12-gauge shotgun,\" he said.\nMr. Dale, who has shoulder-length blond hair and strong opinions, has been driving a cab for more than six years. With 41 cabdrivers killed so far this year in the city, he urged the Taxi and Limousine Commission yesterday to make cabs into \"rolling tanks\" with bulletproof windows and windshields and bulletproof partitions separating drivers and passengers.\nMr. Dale was one of scores of taxi drivers who showed up at the commission hearing on a proposal to help combat the seemingly unending series of cabby killings by requiring that partitions be installed between the front and back seats. Some drivers denounced partitions as less safe because they cut down on visibility and communication; others mentioned, often with palpable sincerity, that the walls would reduce tips.\nIn opposing partitions for the city's 11,787 yellow cabs, Gary Fishman cited his experience in transporting the likes of Jack Dempsey and traveling some 750,000 miles, the equivalent of three trips to the moon. Emotional Discussion\n\"The next comment after 'Can you speak English?' is invariably, \"I'm so glad you don't have that cage, or that jail,\" he said.\nAll in all, it was a wild and free-wheeling, often emotional discussion. Participants ranged from police officials -- who backed partitions as a sure-fire way to cut down on crime -- to independent owner-operators who demanded the right to decide for themselves on the matter, and to makers of high-tech taxi safety gear who stood to profit from requiring partitions.\nThere was even an anti-partition lawyer, William Pollak, who stood up and quoted Robert Frost: \"Something there is that doesn't love a wall,\" he said.\nThe emotional peak of the meeting came when Fidel F. Del Valle, the commission's chairman, called an industry representative, Debi Ray-Chaudhuri of the Lease Drivers Coalition, \"dense\" and \"a liar\" after she had asked, \"Why does the commission hesitate to protect those most in danger?\"\nThe chairman vehemently denied her charges that the commission was dragging its feet on driver safety. Mr. Del Valle recalled his own father, a cabdriver who was robbed and assaulted several times.\n\"My father died in a cab,\" he shouted. \"Yours didn't.\" Left to Preference\nInterestingly, partitions were required for most cabs in the 1970's, and then later left up to owners' preference.\nCommission officials were not sure why the requirement was allowed to lapse in the late 1970's, though the breakup of the industry into smaller components run by smaller businessmen may have been a factor. Partitions remain in common use for big fleets and are written into some labor agreements.\nAt its next hearing, probably in about a month, the commission plans to vote on the partition rule, as well as another proposed rule that would require external trouble lights, which drivers could surreptitiously activate when threatened.\nThose rules concern only yellow cabs, which pick up street hails, not livery cabs, which are three times as numerous as yellow cabs and respond to telephone calls.\nSeparate meetings and hearings will be held on partitions for livery cabs.\nRonald Stoppelman, president of the Metropolitan Taxi Cab Board of Trade, an association of the large fleet owners, voiced strong support for partitions. The fleets, which include 2,000 cars, have had them for a dozen years and only one of its drivers have been killed during a robbery. He said that one fatality occurred in 1978 when a driver was killed by a gunman standing 15 feet away from the driver's window. Estimates of Cost\nA partition can be bought for as little as $250, Mr. Stoppelman said, though some go for as much as $1,500, others testified.\nWillie Bly, who represents an association of individually owned yellow cabs and said he once had his throat slit while driving a cab, denounced partitions as too expensive.\n\"Already, the culprits out there, the gypsies and the vans, are stealing all our work,\" referring to the ballooning of illegal for-hire vehicles, now estimated to exceed 18,000.\nLarry Goldberg, the secretary-treasurer of Local 36 of the Taxi Drivers Union, said flatly, \"Whether we're from Brooklyn or Bangladesh, our blood is red. Partitions save lives.\"\nMr. Bly said he had polled 219 drivers, and only two wanted partitions. One reason is that air-conditioning would not reach passengers as well. Another is that tall passengers might feel uncomfortable.\n\"Who wants to ride with their knees in his throat?\" he asked."}, {"text": "U.S. Says 165 Concerns Help Belgrade Defy U.N.\n1993-05-21T05:00:00.000Z\nStepping up the economic pressure on Belgrade, the United States today identified a worldwide network of 165 Serbian companies that it said were being used by Belgrade to defy United Nations sanctions.\nThe Administration also barred American companies from doing business with the Serbian concerns and urged foreign governments to freeze the assets of the companies.\n\"Yugoslavia has continued to conduct its international trade and to earn hard currency through its network of foreign-located subsidiaries, branches and representative offices,\" said R. Richard Newcomb, director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. The Yugoslav Connection\nMr. Newcomb said that naming the companies would \"help expose and interdict the millions of dollars in Yugoslav Government assets flowing between private bank vaults abroad.\"\nWith the United States and its allies at odds over how to quell the fighting in the Balkans, economic sanctions remain the main form of leverage on Belgrade.\nThe Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, has said he has closed the Serbian border to Bosnia to all but food and medical relief. But some trucks continue to cross the border, and United States officials have expressed skepticism about Mr. Milosevic's intentions in his late support of the United Nations-European Community peace plan, which has been repeatedly rejected by his Serbian colleagues in Bosnia. A Test for U.S. Allies\nPublication of the list of Serbian companies will not only increase pressure on Belgrade, but also effectively put many United States allies to a test. Russia and Western European nations, which have stressed the need to press Belgrade and the Bosnian Serbs to stop the fighting in the Balkans, are now being asked to freeze the assets of the companies on their territory.\nUnder the Security Council resolution adopted last month to tighten economic sanctions on Yugoslavia, United Nations members are required to take action against companies identified as working on behalf of Belgrade.\nMany of the 165 companies named by the United States were once part of the state-run trading system of Yugoslavia, which now consists of Serbia and Montenegro. Although these companies are no longer state-owned, United States officials say, they are still taking orders from Belgrade.\n\"The companies named today either are organized or located in Yugoslavia or are owned or controlled by other Yugoslavia-based companies or the Yugoslav Government,\" the Treasury Department said in a statement today. Source of Foreign Exchange\nThe Administration says some of the companies have been a useful source of foreign currency for Serbia. By earning foreign exchange, the companies are able to finance attempts to buy and deliver goods to Serbia in violation of United Nations sanctions.\nUnited States officials said that other companies listed as being under Belgrade's control are not currently believed to be actively involved in circumventing the trade ban. But the officials worry that some dormant companies controlled by Yugoslavia could be activated as other parts of the trading network are shut down.\nMany of the companies are foreign branches of General Export and Inex-Interexport Ltd., Serbian-based trading companies. Others are individual companies located around the world.\nThe network reaches well into Russia and Eastern Europe. The Treasury Department named companies in Russia, Ukraine, Latvia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania and Poland as being under the control of Yugoslavia. Companies in West Europe\nCompanies based in Western Europe that are controlled by Yugoslavia are located in Germany, Italy, Greece, Britain, Norway, France, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, Finland and Liechtenstein, the Treasury Department said.\nA number of companies are in Cyprus, long a focus of concern because of Yugoslav banks and companies there. Some companies identified as being under Yugoslav control are in Arab and Islamic nations, which have been demanding that tough action be taken to protect the Bosnian Muslims against Serbian attacks.\nSpecifically, the Treasury Department listed companies in Kuwait, Syria, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Iraq, Turkey and Libya as being under Yugoslav control. Companies In Iran\nExport companies in Iran, which has been shipping arms to the Muslims, were also named, as were companies in Pakistan, Bangladesh and India.\nOther concerns that have reportedly worked for the Serbs can be found in Israel, China, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Armenia, the Sudan, Togo, Zambia, Cuba, Australia and Canada.\nNone of the companies listed today are based in the United States, though a dozen of them have done business with American companies, according to United States officials.\nThe Treasury Department also named five individuals as working on behalf of Belgrade. They include Bosko Kostic at AY Bank Ltd., the Anglo-Yugoslav bank in England. Another is Miodrag Zecevic at the Banque Franco Yugoslav in Paris.\nA senior Administration official said the identification of the companies was likely to prompt Belgrade to \"go covert\" and establish a new underground network of companies to support sanctions-busting efforts.\n\"We will seek to identify the underground network as well, to the extent we have the resources to do it,\" the official said.\nAn assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency earlier this year concluded that sanctions alone were unlikely to halt the fighting in Bosnia, in part because the Bosnian Serbs had large stocks of weapons and were being resupplied by the Yugoslav Government. Some experts believe, however, that Belgrade could slow the fighting if Mr. Milosevic enforced the strict blockade on the Bosnian Serbs, as he has vowed to do."}, {"text": "U.N. Flight From Bosnia's Reality\n1993-07-25T05:00:00.000Z\nWhen reports first reached here Thursday that Serbian nationalists were advancing on Sarajevo, the Security Council condemned the offensive and demanded \"an immediate end to all attacks.\"\nThe statement had a familiar ring, reaffirming \"the unacceptability of ethnic cleansing,\" the destruction and forced relocation of population groups by nationality or religion. It urged the combatants to meet in Geneva \"to negotiate in earnest.\"\nIn echoing demands that have been issued by the United Nations Security Council at various times through the 15-month Bosnian war, most of which have had almost no effect on the fighting, the statement added to the mood of futility inside the Council's air-conditioned meeting rooms. There is an atmosphere of unreality and disconnection between the diplomatic consultations here and the killing, desperate food and water shortages, and a sense of abandonment among civilians caught up in the war.\nMany diplomats and United Nations officials contrast the ineffectiveness of the Security Council's ultimatums to the Serbs with the speed and effectiveness with which an international coalition was mobilized against Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.\n\"What's happening here and what's happening on the ground are totally different,\" a diplomat said of the resolutions on Bosnia. \"And it needn't be.\"\nThe diplomat added, \"There is a dual standard at work, and the whole world has taken note.\"\nFor others contemplating the failure to halt the war of Serbs, Croats and Muslims in Bosnia, the problem is not simply one of the big powers' refusing to act decisively. Though public discussion at the United Nations remains diplomatically polite, mutual recrimination about the Bosnian fighting is becoming more common.\nOne view, for example, is that Islamic countries, despite their expressions of sympathy for the Muslim victims in Bosnia, have done less than the Europeans to provide money and troops for the United Nations force there. Neither Safe Nor Timely\nThe most recent major United Nations initiative, the designation of six predominantly Muslim towns as \"safe areas\" in May, suggests just how difficult it is for the world organization to act quickly and decisively.\nShortly after the Security Council selected Sarajevo, Bosnia's capital, and five other cities and towns for protection against Serbian attack, it approved a plan by Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to send 7,500 more troops to guard the areas. Mr. Boutros-Ghali has since met with possible contributors to the expanded force, including a number of Islamic nations that for the first time offered troops for use in the former Yugoslavia. That initiative has stalled.\nEven before the Council adopted the resolution on havens, the idea was opposed by nonaligned nations and Muslim nations, which felt that the towns selected would be little better than prison camps, and that creation of such havens would have the effect of legitimizing Serbs' seizure of Muslims' land.\nLater, when faced with continuing territorial advances by the Serbs, the Muslims and the nonaligned accepted the concept of havens, but indicated that they wanted them to be larger than proposed. Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Indonesia, Jordan, Turkey and Iran have recently offered troops.\nSome of these offers were viewed as posturing. Those that seemed genuine often had drawbacks -- the troops have sometimes been ill-equipped, untrained or unacceptable to Western nations that dominate the peace force. Soldiers from Iran and the P.L.O., for example, would be unacceptable to the West.\nThe only offer the Secretary General has accepted, at least in principle, is from Pakistan, diplomats here said. Germany has offered to provide equipment like trucks and armored personnel carriers to those troops, but the Pakistanis would first have to be trained in its use.\nThus it seems highly unlikely that any of the 7,500 troops authorized by the Security Council will be ready to take up positions for several weeks at the earliest, and it is possible that the Serbs by then may have taken over some of the intended havens.\nThere are now 23,183 troops on the ground as part of the United Nations force. Most of the soldiers assigned to Bosnia are striving to assure the delivery of food and medicine by convoy. Such deliveries have saved lives.\nThe Security Council also imposed trade and other sanctions last year against the truncated Yugoslav federation, the Bosnian Serbs' main financier, and the penalties have damaged the federation's economy.\n\"All these are not unreal,\" said Sir David Hannay, Britain's representative here. \"But there is no magic wand of a military solution to be waved over the East River, because the members of the United Nations are not prepared to undertake a military solution. Hence the feeling of frustration. Hence the feeling that the wild men on the ground tend to get their way.\"\nStill, few would argue, especially in light of the Serbian advance outside Sarajevo, that collective security has functioned well. Each nation or group of nations -- the Western Europeans, the United States, the Muslim countries, the nonaligned, can accuse one another of not doing enough.\nMuslim nations viewed as moderate in the West, like Pakistan and Egypt, are caught in a political quandary. Growing Islamic fundamentalist movements accuse the governments there of abandoning fellow Muslims in Bosnia. But taking up the tasks of delivering aid and resettling refugees is viewed by many Muslims as an acceptance of the Serbs' conquest and as acceding to European wishes.\nA number of countries, like Pakistan and Malaysia, have accepted some Bosnian refugees, but the numbers actually resettled is only in the hundreds.\nThe Security Council's big powers have faced a fundamental problem since they were confronted with the Yugoslav conflict two years ago.\nBecause of domestic political concerns or limited resources, they have been unwilling to make any vast commitment to do more than try to alleviate some of the suffering. Two Choices, Both Bad\nIf the Security Council continues, as it did on Thursday, to issue largely ineffectual declarations, its credibility is endangered. If it does not issue some kind of response, it will presumably be criticized for doing nothing. Facing this dilemma, it has in general responded by issuing more declarations.\nSince the end of 1991, the Council has approved nearly 20 Yugoslav resolutions and numerous \"presidential statements.\" In some cases these authorized action -- like the economic sanctions against Belgrade that were approved a year ago and strengthened in April, the arms embargo against all the former Yugoslav republics and the creation of the United Nations force that has sought to protect convoys.\nMany other resolutions seem to fall into the category of wishes, like the creation of an international war-crimes tribunal with the principal goal of prosecuting Serbs responsible for carrying out atrocities against civilians. It also authorized the use of air strikes against Serbian attackers.\nAt such points, reality has intruded. In the absence of allied military intervention, it is impossible to hold war-crimes trials without being able to arrest suspected war criminals. And air power has not been used to defend Muslims facing attack.\nNot one of the 7,500 soldiers authorized in May has so far been sent to Bosnia to protect a \"safe area,\" a term that these days arouses particular derision and black humor in Sarajevo. BALKAN UPDATE\nAround SARAJEVO yesterday, Bosnian Serb forces renewed intensive ground and artillery attacks on Government troops defending hillsides on the northern edge of the city, including KOBILJA GLAVA and SLATINA, which were hit by tank, artillery and mortar shells.\nAt a news conference in the city, the U.N. commander in BOSNIA said all shelling in the region would be halted at 10 A.M. on Sunday."}, {"text": "Foreign Stocks: High Return, and Risk\n1993-04-10T05:00:00.000Z\nJeff Eliasoph insists he's no gambler when it comes to his family's savings. But increasingly, he is looking to foreign shores for new investment opportunities. With $21,000 in international holdings, he has invested in everything from global mutual funds to the Mexican phone company.\n\"It's clearer that we're all one world,\" said Mr. Eliasoph, a 36-year-old newscaster in Dallas. \"I think I'd be missing out if I didn't invest overseas.\"\nOther Americans are reaching the same conclusion. No longer deterred by currency risks and fears of political instability, American institutions and individuals put an estimated $300 billion into foreign equity markets last year. That's up from just $18 billion in 1980.\nThe primary reason: the potential for high returns. Stock prices outside the United States rose nearly 12 percent in dollar terms in the first quarter, according to the Financial Times world index. That compares with about 3.7 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500 index.\nCiting a shortage of values in United States stocks and projecting rapid growth overseas, some financial planners suggest that foreign equities should account for 10 to 20 percent of individuals' investment portfolios.\n\"That's where the real values are,\" said Stanley Heilbronn, a financial consultant with Merrill Lynch & Company in New York. \"Foreign stocks today are what growth stocks were 15 years ago.\"\nThe risks, of course, have not disappeared. Currency fluctuations and government actions can unexpectedly hammer the stock price of a foreign company. Investors who hope to benefit from foreign purchases, financial experts say, should do their research and be prepared for the long haul. Two to five years is usually long enough to ride out the short-term ups and downs, although these investments must be managed actively and you may want to sell if a stock is performing poorly.\nHow are foreign holdings acquired? Instead of navigating a remote foreign stock market, individual investors can buy mutual funds or purchase shares of foreign companies traded on American exchanges. Mutual funds continue to be viewed as the safest way to go international. After a lackluster period, these vehicles just posted their best return in four years. World equity funds rose by 9.74 percent in the first quarter, compared with 3.29 percent for general-equity funds that invest in American companies, according to Lipper Analytical Services. With an open-ended global fund, investors can expect professional management and diversification to minimize the risks.\nClosed-end funds, which are traded like shares on the stock exchange, are another way to invest abroad. Most of these offerings are \"country funds,\" such as the Indonesia Fund, that invest in companies from the same country or region. These funds can be a good way to get involved in an emerging market, but experts see drawbacks. For one, the net asset value of the funds frequently declines once they are listed on an exchange. Second, less diversification means more volatility.\nThese considerations were important when Mr. Eliasoph started a college fund for his 2-year-old daughter, Vivien. He wanted diversification among countries and companies and professional management. After researching the options, he chose the Dragon Fund, which invests in companies in Asia excluding Japan. \"It's conservative and I've been pleased with the returns,\" he said. Since he invested in June 1992, the fund's value has risen 11.2 percent.\nInvestors accustomed to sorting through individual companies' financial information can choose from more than 1,000 foreign companies whose stocks are listed on exchanges in the United States. And the auto maker Daimler-Benz recently announced that it intended to become the first German company listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\nTypically, investors in foreign companies end up with American depository receipts, or a claim of ownership in an overseas company. Daimler-Benz, for one, intends to issue A.D.R.'s. Instead of shipping its shares back and forth between countries, the company will deposit the shares in a custodian bank and issue the buyer a receipt.\nOn a suggestion from his broker, Mr. Eliasoph took his biggest gamble by putting some retirement money into A.D.R.'s sold on the Nasdaq market for Telefonos de Mexico, or Telmex, in November 1990. \"This was a very, very good investment,\" Mr. Eliasoph said, adding that it \"more than doubled\" in value by the time he sold in April 1991.\nThough A.D.R.'s allow investors to avoid local transfer taxes and they are dollar-denominated, they do not protect against currency risks. \"It's a common misconception,\" said John Dessauer, whose newsletter tracks foreign investing.\nMr. Dessauer believes there are many bargains in A.D.R.'s and foreign stocks traded in the United States. In the pink sheets of unlisted stocks, he notes, one finds high-profile companies like Nestle, the world's largest food company.\n\"It's not like U.S. stocks where you think you find only junk in the pink sheets,\" said Mr. Dessauer, who publishes Dessauer's Journal of Financial Markets from Orleans, Mass.\nInvestors with deep pockets, a strong stomach and patience might consider buying directly overseas, through a foreign stock exchange. \nInvesting in a foreign market tends to be complicated. To trade on a hot tip in Bangladesh, you will probably need to open a brokerage account there. Fees can be steep, and there are often local taxes. The transaction may take some time to execute and some exchanges, like Tokyo's, will sell shares only in lots of 1,000.\nAnother drawback: financial reporting differences. German companies, for example, have hidden reserves that can be used to shore up profits in bad years. \"There's no way even the most wide-open countries in this respect give you as much disclosure as you're used to in the U.S.,\" said John Silvia, the chief economist for Kemper Financial Services. \nFor these reasons many investment advisers urge caution. Individuals should evaluate a foreign company by looking at its fundamentals and long-term prospects.\nThis approach keeps Mr. Eliasoph fairly comfortable.\n\"I try not to get too worried about the short-term ups and downs,\" he said. \"It's like my profession -- what's big news on Monday can be out of the news by Wednesday. So I've learned to look at the big picture.\""}, {"text": "ENDPAPER: LIFE AND TIMES; Death Benefits\n1993-10-03T05:00:00.000Z\nLOOKING BACK OVER a career, I wonder whether perhaps the opportunity to come to terms with death was not a major fringe benefit of my calling.\nI'm not among the few journalists who grew rich on news, nor among the fewer still who enjoy the public esteem accorded to entertainment stars. But I wouldn't have traded journalism for another calling; our trade is nearly always fun, it is often enlightening and it is occasionally uplifting. More to the point, journalism helps its practitioners accept the ubiquity of death, permitting us to enter the heathen equivalent of a state of grace: a gift not to be scorned.\nIt isn't that journalists fear death less than other people. It's just that we are a little more familiar with it than some, and we realize that despite its sting, death has its points.\nI was deeply affected by something written in 1987 by Vaclav Havel, the playwright, dissident and future President of the Czech Republic. In an underground essay, \"Stories and Totalitarianism,\" Havel told of a political prisoner who had asthma and whose life was threatened because of constant exposure to cigarette smoke. An American woman learned of the case and telephoned an editor of \"an important American daily,\" who is supposed to have replied: \"Call me when the man dies.\" Havel commented: \"It's a shocking incident but in some ways understandable. Newspapers need a story. Asthma is not a story. Death could make it one.\"\nCasting an eye over the craft of journalism, he concluded: \"As long as humans can remember, death has been the point at which all the lines of every real story converge.\"\nMaybe Havel exaggerated a little. After all, news is also about the national debt, the weather, the debut of a young artist at Carnegie Hall, the discovery of a new quark, the Super Bowl, the latest mating rituals and so on. But even so, I think Havel was fundamentally right; death has certainly been the point of convergence for the stories I most vividly remember.\nParadoxically, I didn't see a lot of death as a soldier in Korea -- an episode in my life that accidentally transformed me from a chemist into a tank gunner and thence into a journalist. But later, as a young reporter in rural Orange County, N.Y., my beat was an endless parade of the dead: farmers mangled by disc harrows, highway victims smeared over the blacktop, suicides with heads turned inside out by shotguns, picnicking families electrocuted by lightning, drowned children, bludgeoned husbands and wives, ad nauseam.\nFor the neophyte, every corpse cuts deep into personal reserves of pity, grief and horror. But little by little, one builds up the scar tissue that enables journalists, doctors, soldiers, cops and undertakers to function. I learned to concentrate on the mechanics of taking notes and pictures, closing my mind to some of the horror.\nIt was like that in 1963 when I watched and photographed a Buddhist monk named Thich Quang Duc as he burned to death at a Saigon intersection. The expression of agony on the old monk's face and the smell of his scorched flesh would have overwhelmed me if I had had to watch without busying myself with something. As it was, I knew I must work, just as Thich Quang Duc was working at his act of protest. His suicide (and my photographs of it) played some role in bringing down the Saigon Government, but all that mattered to me was to close out the horror by working.\nLater, a few critics suggested that I should have tried to prevent the suicide. But even if I could have fought my way through the throng of monks hemming in Thich Quang Duc, it would never have occurred to me to do so; newsmen covering political events are supposed to record them, not redirect them.\nWar correspondents get to see more people die in the name of patriotism, faith and honor than ever were killed by malice. Sometimes, perhaps, these blood orgies may be worth the sacrifice, but I can't help thinking of the Spanish Civil War as a counterexample.\nI was covering Spain in 1975 when Franco peacefully died after 36 years of despotic rule, and Spain transformed itself into a liberal democracy. The Spanish Civil War, memorialized by Hemingway, Orwell, Picasso and a host of others as the archetypal conflict of good and evil, had been utterly in vain, it seemed to me. Two million people had followed their flags to death, to no enduring end whatever.\nMountains of dead -- starved mummies of Bangladesh, blasted villagers in Indochina, earthquake victims in Peru, the huddled corpses of retreating Iraqi boys wearing brand-new fatigues. They all stir pity and disgust, however thick one's psychic callus. Anyone nurtured by the American dream of miracle cures, eternal youth and life without death must be revolted by scenes of mass extinction.\nBut to a veteran journalist, death can come to seem a palliative rather than an enemy, a merciful reliever of inescapable, unbearable pain. As our impoverished world grows inexorably more populous, it seems that only death can cure the searing cramps of hordes of bloated bellies.\nThat observation has nothing to do with ideology. It is a matter of simple mercy. Three years ago Dr. Maurice King, a prominent British public-health educator, wrote in The Lancet that many of the third-world victims of cholera and dysentery who until recently would have been doomed to speedy deaths can now be kept alive by oral rehydration. But when people plagued by cholera are also dying of hunger, a thoughtful public-health official must make Solomonic decisions, he said.\nMeasures like oral rehydration \"should not be introduced on a public-health scale,\" King wrote, \"since they increase the man-years of human misery, ultimately from starvation.\"\nAnd so one comes to the view that death may be more a kindly friend than a malign predator. We all succumb, and the best science and medicine in the world will never cure death or even postpone it for long.\nWhen news stories converge on death, as Havel put it, they do not arise merely from some morbid perspective; death is a facet of reality, and its face is sometimes more benign than people outside the news fraternity may realize."}, {"text": "HINDU STORM: A special report.; Trust Is Torn: Police Role in Bombay Riots\n1993-02-04T05:00:00.000Z\nNazira Khatoon rocked slowly back and forth on a dirty mat, a bundle of quilts, a few plastic bags pulled close around her. A stream of tears glistened on her face as she recounted how a mob broke into her house in a Bombay shantytown and seized her son as the police looked on and did nothing.\n\"I said, 'Don't do anything to my son,' \" she recalled. \"He was married just two days before. The mob of 250 came. They were with swords and stones, and they pushed me into the bathroom. They took all my property and killed my son in front of me. The police just stood there watching.\"\nDay after day after day, for nine days and nights beginning Jan. 6, mobs of Hindus rampaged through this city, killing and burning people only because they were Muslims. No Muslim was safe -- not in the slums, not in high-rise apartments, not in the city's bustling offices -- in an orgy of violence that left 600 people dead and 2,000 injured. Many Details Unreported\nNow, as quiet settles in the city, the full dimensions of the violence are becoming increasingly clear, although many details -- including transcripts of police radio transmissions and other evidence showing that the police took part in the anti-Muslim violence -- have not been printed in Indian newspapers or magazines.\n\"It is cold-blooded,\" Alyque Padamsee, the chief executive of Lintas, India's largest advertising company, said of the killings. \"This is a very cold-blooded pogrom. There are no concentration camps, though. They just kill people.\"\nInterviews with victims, relief workers, politicians, civic leaders, police officers and journalists have suggested, moreover, that the killing, arson and looting were far from random.\nIn fact, they were organized by Hindu gangs, abetted by the Bombay police and directed at Muslim families and businesses. The extent of police cooperation with the Hindu mobs appears to have spread through the entire police force, excluding only the most senior officers.\nTranscripts of conversations between the police control room and officers on the streets, taken from the regular police radio band and made available to The New York Times by an Indian reporter, show that the officers at police headquarters repeatedly told constables in the field to allow Muslim homes to burn and to prevent aid from reaching victims.\nAccording to one transcript, for instance, the control room referred to the site of a fire by saying it must be a garage owned by a Muslim man, with the speaker using a vulgar term for a circumcised man in the language of Maharashtra state.\n\"Let it burn,\" he added, according to the transcript. \"If it belongs to a Maharashtrian, don't burn anything that belongs to a Maharashtrian.\" The voice added that the police should \"burn everything\" belonging to a Muslim, this time using another obscene reference to Muslims.\nThroughout the nine days of rioting, witnesses said that neither the Maharashtra authorities nor the central Government in New Delhi made any effort to stanch the flow of blood.\nAccording to witnesses, Muslim mothers watched as their sons were pulled from their homes, slain or burned alive while mobs of chanting, cheering Hindus danced around the blazing bodies. Mosques and Muslim stores were firebombed. Men on the street were made to drop their trousers so Hindu mobs could see if they were circumcised, as all Muslim men are.\nIn the aftermath of the violence, hundreds of thousands of Muslims have fled the city, many of them unlikely ever to return. The Background Violence Becomes More Systematic\nSince its independence from Britain and partition with the Muslim nation of Pakistan in 1947, India has been regularly torn by sectarian violence and bloodshed, especially between Hindus and Muslims.\nThere have also been cases when the violence seemed organized. In 1984, after Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was gunned down by her Sikh bodyguards, a campaign of murderous retribution that many charged was abetted or instigated by governing Congress Party politicians left thousands of Sikhs dead in New Delhi.\nBut after the riots in Bombay, India's mightiest economic center, many people say the violence has never before been so systematic, concentrated and foreboding.\nThe bloodshed has stunned Bombay and raised doubts about whether the city will ever recover. Before the riots, many Bombayites had let themselves think that their city had triumphed over caste and religious conflicts and that nothing like this could happen here.\n\"Some of the happenings in Bombay do bear a resemblance to Germany in the 1930's,\" said Nani Palkhivala, a constitutional lawyer and former Indian Ambassador to the United States. \"These are things we have never seen in 300 years of Bombay. People were literally burnt alive. Is this civilization? Is this humanity?\"\nMuch of Bombay's gloom comes from the inaction of the government. Neither the Chief Minister of Maharashtra state, Sudhakarrao Naik, nor the Indian Prime Minister, P. V. Narasimha Rao, reacted to the violence as it consumed the city.\nIn the eyes of many people in Bombay, Mr. Rao has been indifferent to the problem. Delegations of this city's leading citizens, its business leaders, movie stars and even the Roman Catholic cardinal met with him in New Delhi to urge some action.\n\"He just sat there,\" a participant said. \"He just said, 'Yes, yes,' and then we were led out.\"\nThe physical scars of the violence can be seen everywhere. Bombay is a megalopolis of 12.5 million people with luxury high-rise buildings, great swathes of shantytowns, avenues of glittering jewelry and fashion shops and pavements carpeted by street dwellers.\nBut now the hulks of charred cars, trucks and buses, like the carapaces of desiccated beetles, litter the gutters. Rows of storefronts are interspersed by the firebombed shells of Muslim-owned shops, like missing teeth. Bombay's bread shops, almost exclusively owned by Muslims, have been gutted. Lumber yards were torched, as were much of the city's leather workshops, all Muslim-owned.\nFor much of the last six months, India has been wrapped in a tightening web of tension as Hindu religious and political organizations have called for tougher treatment of India's 110 million Muslims.\nThe first overt violence supported by this broad coalition was the demolition of a 16th-century mosque in December in the northern religious town of Ayodhya that Hindus said had been constructed on the site that they revere as the birthplace of the god Ram.\nThe destruction of the mosque led to widespread Muslim protests and clashes with the police and security forces in which more than 2,000 people were officially reported to have died all across India, including 200 in Bombay.\nAfter the destruction of the mosque, the Rao Government did order a ban on some militant Hindu and Muslim organizations and arrested several leaders. But here in Bombay, the authorities did not ban a virulently anti-Muslim organization called Shiv Sena or arrest any of its members. The Beginning Two Sparks Ignite Waves of Rioting\nAs the first wave of violence over the mosque subsided, Shiv Sena was apparently preparing a systematic campaign against the city's one million Muslims. What it needed was an incident, real or fabricated, that might call forth mobs of Hindu street thugs to carry out the attacks.\nThe moment came Jan. 6, with the stabbing of two Hindu dock workers, and on Jan. 7, when a Hindu family of four was burned to death in its hut in the slums of Jogeshwari in north Bombay.\nSoon after the first incident, the wave of arson and attacks began.\nThe violence was recounted by Shamim Mohammed Khan as she stood in a silent line of other women waiting for relief workers to distribute grain from a small sack. Although 19, she looked older, having lost her home and her belongings in the attacks. The violence, she said, did not seem spontaneous.\n\"After the first wave of riots in December, some people came and asked what I had in my house,\" she said. \"They were very friendly in manner. When the second wave came, they came and killed my husband. The Shiv Sena, they came. Fifty people came, armed with sticks, chains, pipes, axes.\"\n\"I think my neighbors came only because they were forced,\" she said. \"They were told, 'If you don't help, we will get you.' So my neighbors took my utensils, my pots and dishes, and sold them.\"\nShe added that afterward they burned down the entire slum area, leaving 500 people homeless.\nAs the violence and the death toll climbed, Saamna, the daily newspaper published by Shiv Sena, urged its followers on. The paper is read by hundreds of thousands of lower-middle-class and lower-class people of Maharashtra, whose capital is Bombay.\n\"They have taken advantage of our helplessness and timidity,\" the paper wrote on Jan. 9, referring to the city's Muslims. Charging that Hindus had been \"massacred\" in the two incidents in Bombay, it said, \"If the law cannot protect us, then the hell with the law.\" The Authorities Police Complicity Is Documented\nAlong the corridors of retail commerce in Bombay, the once seamless face of shop fronts is punctuated by the blackened cavities of Muslim businesses -- a cloth store, a baker, a hardware shop. Along the same street, Hindu shops were left undamaged.\n\"They had the business license registers from the city,\" a reporter here said of the rioters, asking that his name not be used. \"With the registers, they could find the Muslims, even those which were owned by Hindus but rented to Muslim businesses.\"\nAnd nowhere during the attacks on Muslim shops did Bombay's police impede the attacks. Indeed, there is widespread evidence that they ignored the looting and firebombing and even encouraged it or took part.\nA Hindu merchant shopkeeper, speaking on the condition that his name not be used, described how a police truck pulled up in front of a neighboring shop. \"A police inspector, I saw his rank on his uniform, came out with some constables,\" he said. \"They broke the lock on the shop and went inside. They came out with all the shoes and put them in the truck. Then they burned the shop.\"\n\"I know many of these Shiv Sena boys,\" he said. \"I grew up with them. And I'm scared.\"\nEven in Bombay's wealthiest residential areas, neighborhoods filled with the corporate barons of India, the violence penetrated. Shoba De, the author of several popular novels and the wife of a leading businessman, said Shiv Sena mobs had searched apartment buildings for Muslims.\n\"They went door to door asking who is Muslim,\" she said. \"They would look on the name boards in the lobby and then go upstairs and throw the Muslim families out of their apartments and put padlocks on them.\"\nThe most startling evidence of police complicity has been in the transcripts of conversations picked up off the police radio band. These have been obtained by some reporters in India and translated into English, although they have not been printed in Indian newspapers or magazines, apparently because they are too inflammatory.\nIn one conversation, for instance, the police in a district called Dongri asked the control room what to do about two army trucks filled with milk sent as relief to a slum area where Muslims had been burned out of their huts.\n\"Why are you distributing milk to them?\" the control room asked. \"Do not distribute milk to the laandyas. Have you understood?\" Then the control room ordered, \"Seize that vehicle.\"\n\"The police have been playing a very negative role,\" said Farida Lambay, a social worker who was trying to resettle Muslim families who had been burned out of their homes. She said the police had become \"very, very communalized,\" a term referring to virulent sectarian prejudice, and added: \"People have lost faith in the police.\"\nConfronted with reports of police complicity, Babanrao Pachpute, the Maharashtra Home Minister, at first denied that the police had been involved in attacks on Muslims. But when it was pointed out that there were tapes of police radio conversations and accounts by witnesses, he said: \"It was so difficult for the police. There were so many people in the mobs, it was difficult for them.\"\nPressed further, the minister said: \"All these things will be revealed in the judicial inquiry. We are taking actions and putting people behind bars.\"\nThe state government has appointed a Bombay high court judge to investigate the riots, although many doubt that it will lead to any firm conclusions or to prosecution of individuals.\nThe inquiry was established after at least three private groups in Bombay called for an investigation. The groups are the Committee to Protect Human Rights, a small group; the Bombay Chapter of the People's Union of Civil Liberties, a legal rights agency, and an ad hoc group of senior industrialists led by J. R. D. Tata, who heads India's largest industrial house. The Militants Group's Leader Defends Attacks\nThe man driving the Shiv Sena forward, and the voice behind its newspaper Saamna, is Bal Thackery, who rose to visibility a decade ago by leading a violent campaign against southern Indians who had settled in Bombay.\nIn an interview at his home, Mr. Thackery refused repeatedly to respond to charges that his followers had engaged in killing and destruction throughout the city.\n\"Those who started the riots,\" he said, referring to Muslims, \"have learned their lessons well.\"\nIn an interview with The Economic Times, a leading financial journal, he said his followers were only responding to violence committed against them. \"They participated only to the extent of retaliating to the attacks,\" he said.\nMr. Thackery's political activities started in the 1980's, when he demanded that Bombay be kept for the citizens of Maharashtra state, who speak a language and have an ethnic identity distinct from those of neighboring states. Immigration from other parts of India has continued unabated, and now Mr. Thackeray has turned to his anti-Muslim credo.\nDuring the interview, Mr. Thackery allowed only a few notes to be taken, and he was guarded by Bombay policemen with submachine guns. He insisted that he wanted only to evict Muslims who were from Pakistan or Bangladesh, not all Muslims.\n\"All Muslims from Bangladesh and from Pakistan, those elements come to my country to create trouble to see we would never live in peace,\" he said. \"Those Muslims who might have given them shelter must be kicked out.\"\nWhen it was suggested that many Bombay residents were comparing his group's actions to the Nazi attacks on Jews, he reacted angrily. \"I have no respect for intellectuals,\" he said. \"They create problems by giving dirty opinions. I am a man of the masses.\" The Reaction Bombay Ponders Legacy of Hatred\nLike much of India, Bombay has a prosperous intelligentsia proud of its commitment to the principles of secularism and sectarian harmony enshrined in India's constitution, but often ignored in the nation's impoverished slums and villages. The Bombay events have left this elite group shaken.\n\"This will change the face of Bombay forever,\" said Shabana Azmi, a leading movie actress in this film capital of India. \"In January, what happened is that the elite and the middle class were exposed for the first time to the kind of violence the poor are exposed to.\"\nOthers say that the riots exposed how the elite has been complacent and distant from India's real problems.\n\"I think we are guilty of being out of touch,\" said Tariq Ansari, the managing director of Midday Publications. \"The Shiv Sena evolved from a very violent genesis to become part of us. We would do business with them. We've told ourselves, 'They don't do anything major; they do their little violence.' \"\n\"It was interesting that the mobs came out of the slums,\" Mr. Ansari added. \"This was really an upper-class nightmare, the monster coming out of the slums. And I'm convinced it's not over.\"\nNow, although the worst of the violence has passed, at least for the moment, the signs of hatred continue. Labor unions run by Shiv Sena are intimidating Muslim workers, preventing them from returning to their jobs in some of the city's largest industries, including Otis Elevator, the Mahindra jeep and tractor plants and companies on the docks.\nMeanwhile, the \"ethnic cleansing\" of the city's Muslim population proceeds, perhaps not so violently, but still methodically. Railway officials report that 215,000 people, virtually all Muslims, fled the city on special trains. A Hindu Brahmin business woman who employed 15 Bengali Muslims in a fabric business reported that her workers had returned to Calcutta and had said they would never come back to Bombay. \"They said if I moved my workshops out of the city, they might come back,\" she said.\nEvery night, rumors swirl through the shantytowns, bringing fear and desperation. And every night as well, one or two people die in flare-ups of violence, even though the city government insists that Bombay is recovering.\n\"At the end of the tunnel we are in, there is no light,\" the editor of The Illustrated Weekly wrote in a recent edition. \"There are only the gas chambers. We have to decide whether we want to do something about it, or head straight into the blinding darkness.\""}, {"text": "Once Off-Limits, Now Destinations With an Edge\n1993-05-29T05:00:00.000Z\nDeclaring that tourism produces \"a very big income,\" Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya proposed in a recent televised speech that his country encourage mass tourism. And Colonel Qaddafi is not alone in assuming that travel and tourism can aid struggling economies.\nDestinations as diverse as Croatia and Peru are struggling to repair their war-torn tourist infrastructures. Egypt is cracking down on radical Islamic fundamentalists, and one reason officials give is that the terrorists' campaign is harming the country's $3 billion tourist industry, Egypt's largest source of foreign revenue. And the hope of luring tourists with hard currency is why China and Cuba are racing to build hotels, restaurants and other amenities of the travel trade.\nTheir view is supported in a recent report by the World Travel and Tourism Council, a Brussels-based coalition of chief executives from more than 50 travel-related corporations in many countries. It's Not Always Easy\n\"A buoyant travel and tourism sector will employ more people\" and create new jobs and careers faster than any other industry, said the report, compiled by a group of international economists. It added, \"Unlike many industries, there are no lengthy time lags before new jobs, foreign exchange and extra purchasing power filter into the economy.\"\nBut luring tourists to trouble spots, or what they perceive to be trouble spots, is no simple matter.\nFor example, officials in Croatia and Slovenia, in what was formerly Yugoslavia, are eager to restore what had been a thriving tourist trade, but find foreigners confuse their areas with war-wracked Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\"Slovenia and Croatia are both perfectly safe,\" said Rose Pace-Bogdanic, the senior vice president of Sterling Cruises and Tours of Austin, Tex. \"They just suffer from an identity crisis.\"\nShe and Damir-Dodo Bogdanic, her Croatian-born husband, used to promote tours to all of Yugoslavia, until age-old hatreds between Serbs and Croats fragmented the country in 1990 and plunged it into civil war. Last year, Sterling began offering tour packages to the castles, mountains and beaches of Slovenia, which declared its independence in 1991. And later this year it plans to offer tours to Croatia, which has suffered far less damage than some other parts of the former Yugoslavia.\nToward that end, Sterling opened a branch office last month in Ridgefield, N.J., staffed by a former executive of Yugotours International in Belgrade.\n\"Not everyone's going to rush out and go there on a tour,\" Mrs. Pace-Bogdanic said. \"So we plan to start on a limited basis.\"\nBut some Americans are visiting Slovenia. \"The view in North America may be that it's an unsafe place, but it's not as though you're traveling to Bosnia-Herzegovina,\" Scott Schnipper, an American traveler, said by telephone from London last week shortly before his departure. \"It has a modern infrastructure and modern communications.\"\nCuba has an improving tourist climate, including hotels under construction, but is unlikely to rake in Americans' dollars so long as United States law bars most citizens from spending money there.\nNor have tourists been flocking to Libya so far, and Colonel Qaddafi sidestepped any mention of United Nations sanctions against Libya for harboring suspected terrorists -- sanctions that include a ban on travel to his country.\nAnother indication that Libya is unlikely to reap a tourist bonanza anytime soon, at least from English-speaking visitors, is the reluctance of Lonely Planet Publications to add a Libyan travel guide to its book list, which includes guides for such difficult or dangerous destinations as Iran, Myanmar, Yemen, Peru, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Cambodia and Bangladesh.\n\"Nobody's knocking down our door for a book on Libya,\" said Carolyn Miller, promotions manager for Lonely Planet in Oakland, Calif. \"In fact, I don't think I ever heard of any tourist wanting to go there.\"\nOther countries eager for tourism also have a lot to learn about visitors' expectations. In \"Falling Off the Map,\" a book published this month by Alfred A. Knopf, a travel writer, Pico Iyer, notes that North Korea is building the world's largest tourist hotel, 105 stories high -- although few tourists visit the country, which remains one of the world's most regimented and closed societies.\nSimilarly, Vietnam is not most Americans' idea of a vacation paradise, even though Hanoi designated 1990 as the \"Year of Tourism.\" That same year, it began to remodel all of its hotels. It still offers few other amenities for tourists, and visitors say the Vietnamese appear to have unrealistic expectations of what the tourist traffic will bear.\n\"What would be, at most, a three-star hotel by our standards, costs around $200 a night,\" said Dianne Yamamoto of Los Angeles, who recently returned from a 10-day trip to Vietnam and Cambodia. \"It was an incredible visit, but you have to be prepared to rough it, because there's very little tourist infrastructure.\" In contrast to Vietnam, Egypt has well-developed tourism operations, and intrepid travelers continue to visit the Pyramids and cruise the Nile despite attacks by Islamic extremists.\n\"Reports of problems in Egypt affected our business,\" conceded Aza Hussein, operations manager for Naggar Tours in San Francisco, a wholesale travel operator specializing in Egypt. \"But groups are still traveling there.\"\nJohn Yee, a tour leader with Asian Discoveries, a travel agency in Kensington, Calif., branched out to take about 20 people to Egypt last month for 12 days. \"Only two people in our group canceled for safety reasons,\" he said. \"And they missed out on a great visit. Besides, there were no lines at tourist sites.\"\nFew tourist destinations have been as devastated as Peru, which in the 1980's attracted tens of thousands of visitors to Inca sites like Machu Picchu and Cuzco. But a terrorist war that broke out in Ayacucho in 1980 spread through much of the nation, claiming an estimated 25,000 lives, and a cholera epidemic two years ago claimed another several thousand. Tourists stayed away in droves.\nNow, with the founder of the Shining Path terrorists, Abimael Guzman Reynoso, serving a life sentence, officials in Ayacucho and Lima are eager to revive tourism. And that prospect may not be as farfetched as it sounds.\n\"The last couple of years you could have called me two days before Christmas, and I could have booked a room for you at the Machu Picchu Hotel de Turistas,,\" said Luis Vasquez, owner of M.I.L.A./Peru Tours in Wadsworth, Ill. \"But it's already sold out for Christmas this year, and tourism to the rest of Peru has been picking up for the last few months.\"\nTourism is also rebounding in China following sharp declines after Government troops killed protesters around Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989. More than 300,000 Americans and 600,000 Japanese visit China each year, and Beijing hopes to raise those numbers significantly. Thus, it recently joined the Pacific Asia Travel Association, a San Francisco-based organization of airlines, cruise ships, hotels and tour operators from both the private and public sectors.\nMichael Justice, a Los Angeles photographer who recently returned from China, said he had been uneasy about visiting the country after its suppression of protesters.\n\"But a visit isn't an endorsement,\" he said. \"You go to see what's real in a country, before they put up lots of fast-food restaurants.\"\nHe added, \"Besides, my mother was quite happy to see me leave Los Angeles for someplace safer.\""}, {"text": "Peace From Chaos -- A special report.; Mozambique's Outlook Brightens As Truce Holds and Drought Ends\n1993-02-22T05:00:00.000Z\nOn a continent of withered promise, where country after country has defeated recent dreams of creating civil order out of chronic chaos, Mozambique has unexpectedly emerged as a candidate for an African success story.\nWhen a cease-fire was signed in October few expected it would end this country's savagely indiscriminate 16-year war, but it has held for months. A ruthless drought that had aid donors touting Mozambique as the next Somalia has been broken by quenching rains, and the country is carpeted with corn. Peace Plus Rain\nHere in the fertile northwest, refugees who fled the insurgent Mozambique National Resistance, or Renamo, are streaming home from border camps in Malawi and rebuilding the cane huts burned by the rebels. In other regions, food and medicine are reaching villagers isolated for many years behind guerrilla battle lines.\n\"We've got a combination of peace and rain, which there hasn't been in Mozambique for a quarter of a century,\" marveled Arthur M. Hussey 3d, coordinator of relief deliveries for CARE.\nMozambicans from President Joaquim Chissano down to the resettled peasants and dormant warriors describe a universal weariness of war. Foreign donors and diplomats speak of Mozambique with an optimism that surprises them, as a place where the West's post-cold-war ambition of playing midwife to new democracies stands a chance of being fulfilled. Other Crises Distract\nThe greatest danger now to Mozambique's tranquillity, almost everyone agrees, is Mozambique's tranquillity.\nLacking scenes of carnage and starvation to disturb Western television audiences, Mozambique is having trouble competing for attention with Somalia and the former Yugoslavia.\nAs a result, the dispatch of United Nations peacekeeping troops, which is a prerequisite for disarming the rivals, merging them into a new national army and moving toward elections, has fallen far behind schedule.\nSome fear the cease-fire faces a serious test in March, when the new crop comes in and Renamo, which was drawn to the peace table in part by hunger, is no longer dependent on foreign handouts.\n\"Delay is a big danger, of course,\" President Chissano said in an interview at his oceanside residence in Maputo, the capital. \"The soldiers and the Renamo fighters are in the countryside with their arms in hand. They are doing almost nothing, they are waiting to be fed. They can get annoyed.\"\nAldo Ajello, the United Nations special representative in Mozambique, said he hoped the demobilization of the rival forces could begin in April. The country's first elections, once planned for October, are now tentatively scheduled for June or July of 1994.\nMr. Ajello said his superiors in New York, who have more than enough troops volunteered for policing duty in Somalia, have had trouble finding countries interested in dispatching peacekeepers to Mozambique. The reasons, he said, are obvious:\n\"Nobody is dying. Nobody is starving. We are not on CNN.\" The War In Ravaged Nation, Countless Dead\nTo Mozambicans, almost continually at war since 1964, it seemed the dying and starving would never end.\nIt took 10 years of insurrection to dislodge the Portugese colonialists, who abandoned the country in 1975, looting and sabotaging as they fled. The next year, with a Soviet-backed Marxist Government struggling to find its feet, Renamo was born.\nThe guerrilla group had its origins in a loose militia recruited by Portuguese industrialists to protect their interests during the war of independence.\nThis motley band was later adopted by the intelligence service of white-ruled Rhodesia as a tool for destabilizing the Mozambican Government, which provided sanctuary for black Rhodesian insurgents. After blacks won control of Rhodesia (renaming it Zimbabwe), South Africa took over as Renamo's sponsor.\nThe guerrillas, who proclaimed themselves anti-Communists, waged a scorched-earth war aimed at destroying any sign of Government-sponsored progress. They burned clinics by the hundreds, schools by the thousands. They mined and ambushed along Mozambique's transport corridors, blowing food convoys off the roads with bazookas and immobilizing the ports and railroads that were one of Mozambique's few sources of foreign earnings.\nThose who lived under Renamo control tell of massacres and mutilations, rapes and forced labor, and everywhere the kidnapping of children for training as soldiers.\nBy the late 1980's Renamo had lost its foreign patrons, and the Government had abandoned Communism for a version of free-market pragmatism. But the war raged on.\nOf Mozambique's 15 million people, it is estimated that up to one million died, that 1.5 million fled to squalid refugee camps in a half-dozen neighboring countries, and that perhaps 3 million more were driven from their villages into overcrowded towns and cities.\nOver the last two years, the misery was compounded by southern Africa's worst drought of the century.\nWhen President Chissano and the rebel leader, Afonso Dhlakama, signed their peace accord last October after two years of international pressure, there was little confidence that either man could deliver what he promised.\nRenamo was widely regarded as an uncontrollable gang of young thugs, and Government soldiers were badly demoralized, prone to looting sprees and occasional terrorism. Anarchy seemed the more probable fate of this hungry and gun-saturated land. The Peace Paralyzed Country Is Stirring Again\nThe most immediate sign of normalcy is that Mozambique, long paralyzed, is moving.\nRelief workers who relied on remote landing strips for their deliveries in Renamo areas now dispatch aid convoys on the highways. Diplomats and journalists who had hunkered down in Maputo now explore the country by road. Sun-worshipers mosey up the coast from Maputo for the more secluded Indian Ocean beaches.\nCities that had swollen with hungry and fearful peasants are now spilling their crowds back into the countryside, and those trapped for years behind Renamo lines have been allowed to leave, emerging with malnutrition, disease and tales of terror.\nWhen they showed up at a relief center here, Chassassa Nvunganene, 30, and her three skinny children had walked three days from a Renamo zone in the central province of Sofala. They trudged barefoot, surviving on grasshoppers and roots.\nListlessly she recounted a common litany of sorrows: Renamo captives since 1989, one daughter dead of malaria in a Renamo camp, husband killed by a land mind while hauling food for the guerrillas. Only three months after the cease-fire, she said, did their captors relent.\n\"Renamo said, 'If you want to go, you can go, we don't have food for you,' \" Mrs. Nvunganene said, as her 6-year old son fished a squirming grasshopper from a plastic bag and handed it to his little sister.\nWestern relief workers say the tide of victims like Mrs. Nvunganene has now subsided to a comparative trickle.\nThree months ago, said Felice Dindo, the chief delegate for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Mozambique, \"we were seeing people starving and nothing moving.\"\nWe were blocked on the roads,\" he said. Now, \"the emergency, we can say, is over, at least in the places we've been able to reach.\"\nThis is an important caveat. Relief workers believe that in some Renamo strongholds, especially the valley along the Zambezi River, there are still substantial pockets of hungry people stricken by cholera and other disease, isolated by demolished roads and the estimated two million land mines seeded across the country.\nCrews are removing the mines and slowly opening routes into these areas.\nWhen Red Cross workers first penetrated late last year into Chibabava, in central Mozambique, Mr. Dindo said, they were alarmed to find 20,000 fearful squatters jammed into the town and a raging cholera epidemic. Doctors and nurses were rushed in, work crews began digging latrines. But in December they found another way to clear up the problem.\n\"We distributed seeds in December, and the population was down to 2,000 in a matter of a month,\" Mr. Dindo said. Everyone went home to plant corn. The Combatants The Road Back To Brotherhood\nPerhaps the most striking sight on a 400-mile drive along the once perilous roads of north and central Mozambique was the casual foot traffic of Renamo fighters and Government soldiers, some armed and others not, exchanging polite greetings as they passed one another.\n\"Come here, my brother,\" yelled Tembo Beachane, a Government soldier, hailing a Renamo guerrilla to meet visiting reporters in the market town of Guro.\nThe guerrilla, Josias Mbaula, had trudged for two days in his knee-high rubber boots to mail letters in Guro and was now meandering back to base, an AK-47 assault rifle strung over his shoulder. A guerrilla for 13 of his 33 years, six times wounded, he now chattered amiably about the peace.\n\"I fought, I finished, and I am happy,\" he declared, and like every other combatant interviewed along the route he predicted an easy reconciliation. Gesturing at Mr. Beachane, he said, \"We will understand each other because we belong to the same family.\"\nAsked when he would surrender his weapon, and what he wanted to do next, the Renamo man answered automatically, as did almost every Renamo fighter to whom the question was put:\n\"For me, everything depends on what they tell me to do.\"\nWestern peacekeepers who have been surveying the military situation in Mozambique in preparation for demobilization said this answer was typical, and reassuring. It suggests that Renamo is under much tigher control than previously supposed, and thus likely to disarm when ordered.\nIndeed, United Nations officials and diplomats said, the guerrillas appear far better disciplined than the disgruntled army.\nThe plan mapped out by the United Nations calls for fighters -- an estimated 20,000 from Renamo, perhaps 70,000 Government forces -- to be mustered at 49 assembly points policed by international troops.\nAfter registering, turning in their weapons, and getting medical checkups, they will be issued civilian clothes and money. Some will be sent for training as soldiers in the new national army, to be composed of 15,000 men from each side, and the rest returned to their homes.\nThe object is to avoid the mistakes of Angola, where Western peacemakers pushed for elections before the combatants had been disarmed. Angolan rebels refused to accept their electoral defeat in September, and the renewed fighting has pushed that country to the brink of collapse.\nIn Mozambique, the Security Council has approved a $330 million budget for a peacekeeping force of about 7,500 troops, but Mr. Ajello, the United Nations representative, said that the budget had been stalled in bureaucracy and that member countries had shown little enthusiasm for sending soldiers.\nAfter much lobbying the United Nations has offers of troops from Italy, Uruguay, Bangladesh, Zambia, Botswana and India, but no country has offered the engineering and logistics units needed to rebuild roads and supply the demobilization centers, he said.\nEven so, officials here agree the immediate danger is escalating banditry by restive soldiers, not the resumption of war.\n\"We are prepared to wait for a little while,\" said Vincente Z. Ululu, the general secretary of Renamo, after complaining of the delays. \"We want everything to be fixed properly so we do not have the same mistake like in Angola.\" The Refugees Voting for Peace With Their Feet\nFlying low out of Tete, north toward the jutting mountains of Malawi, a pilot points out the fresh-plaited roofs and green cornstalks of new settlements that were not there last October. This is the district called Angonia, and these are the homes of returned refugees, voting with their feet for peace.\nIn Ulongue, the district capital of Angonia, the district administrator rattled off the estimates of returnees. In October 1,472. In November 9,228. In December 33,184. In January, when the rain slowed them, 31,530.\nThe administrator, Evaristo Wezulo, said two-thirds of Angonia's prewar population of 159,000 had fled. Most have already come home. Those who remain behind, relief workers say, are wives and children subsisting on refugee-camp ration cards until the first harvest at home, or children finishing the Malawi school year.\nSalvatore Ippolito, who oversees United Nations refugee relief efforts from Tete, said the return was spontaneous and unexpected.\n\"The peace agreement surprised us,\" he said. \"It worked so fast and so well.\"\nAmong the refugees themselves, confidence in the peace depends on how recently they have arrived.\nThose fresh from the border, like Maria Viriato, were dubious. Juggling her infant son and a bundle of live chickens, Mrs. Viriato made her way along the road from the border toward her village, Tembwe, laid waste by Renamo in 1987. Her husband had come ahead in December to build a hut and plant a crop.\nWas the war really over? she was asked.\n\"I believe, and I don't believe,\" she replied.\nThose who have been back longer were steadier in their optimism.\nWizidolo Kabango, who returned to his burned-out village in November after hearing about the peace on Malawi radio, felt secure enough that he returned to the refugee camp to fetch his furniture.\nWith a tiny table and two chairs balanced on his head, he was walking the 15 miles home again, \"because there is no more war in Mozambique.\"\nAngonia has the advantage of being fertile and accessible. In other, more devastated regions bordering the southern tip of Malawi, few refugees have gone home because there is no relief lifeline yet to supply them with seeds or to feed them while they plant their first crop.\nMr. Ippolito said that as soon as roads were opened into other areas and seed distributed, donors would gradually cut off rations in Malawi to encourage the rest of Mozambique's displaced to go home. The Outlook With Passion Spent, Time for Politics\n\"Last year we were comparing Mozambique to Somalia,\" said Felice Dindo of the Red Cross. \"This year we were comparing it to Angola.\" As it happens, Mr. Dindo and others agree, Mozambique is neither, and that may be its salvation.\nUnlike Somalia, Mozambique has a functioning Government, and is naturally fertile. Unlike Angola, Mozambique seems to have spent its passions, and to be ready to move to the nonlethal combat of politics.\nIt is too early to say how robust the new democracy will be. Several opposition parties are functioning, but they are penniless and, except for Renamo's political wing, largely unknown. In the countryside, few people have heard about the plans for elections.\nAlmost everyone assumes the ruling party, Frelimo, will win the first elections by default. Renamo leaders say they would accept that outcome, if the elections are fair, and foreign observers here tend to believe them.\nAmong the civilians brutalized by the war, there is lack of vengefulness that is astonishing to an outsider. Some educated Mozambicans attribute it to fatalism, others to the ancient southern African tradition that vanquished enemies are incorporated into the tribe, and still others to a talent for postponing vengeance.\nPerhaps it is simply fatigue with a war that people say made no sense to them. Time and again, victims almost shrugged off their suffering, blaming not Renamo or the Government but \"the war.\"\nAlthough Mozambique's calamity has eased, it is still a long way from the \"prosperidade\" promised on the Government's New Year billboards in Maputo.\n\"We will need aid, in terms of food and other aid, for some years to come,\" said President Chissano. With regular rains, he estimates, the country can again be self-sufficient in food within three years. \"This will consolidate the peace.\"\nManuel Lopes da Costa, the Portuguese Ambassador in Maputo, said Mozambique could expect a quick infusion of income from the reopening of the railroads and ports, and from the sale of energy from a power plant idled by the war.\n\"I would not be surprised if in two or three years the need in Mozambique will be reduced to one-third of what it is now,\" Mr. Lopes da Costa said. \"I would not be surprised if in a decade Mozambique would be a perfectly viable nation.\" MOZAMBIQUE AT A GLANCE\nHISTORY: Portugese colonized the Indian Ocean coast in the late 15th century, but inland principalities remained autonomous until the early 20th century. In the intervening years the area was an important trading center for gold, ivory and slaves. Mozambique became independent on June 25, 1975, after 10 years war. The ruling party, the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (Frelimo) espoused Communism and one-party rule, but it shifted toward free markets and legalized rival parties at end of the 1980's.\nECONOMY: Mainly agricultural, producing cashews, cotton and sugar for export. The ports and railroads are vital corridors for landlocked neighbors.\nPEOPLE: Of the estimated 15 million. there is no dominant ethnic group, but Makua people are thought to be most numerous. The civil war hads a faint ethnic-regiona l undercurrent, with southern Shangaan disproportionately represented in Government, and Ndau and other groups from the center and north tending to predominate in Renamo.\nLAND AREA: 303,769 square miles, about twice the size of California."}, {"text": "Bazaar With the Feel of Bombay, Right in Queens\n1993-01-04T05:00:00.000Z\nA decade ago, when V. N. Prakash began selling jewelry there, 74th Street in Queens was a modest, unhurried shopping district -- a neighborly cluster of delis and groceries, a tailor, a shoemaker and a stationer, and a bakery that was, to the locals anyway, a landmark.\nThese days, though, this two-block street in Jackson Heights has become the nation's largest shopping center for immigrants from India -- a bazaar that could be in Bombay, where the smell of masalas wafts from restaurants and groceries, and thousands of people course through store after store buying saris, spices and jewelry and appliances to send to India.\n\"When I first started, everyone was laughing at me,\" said Mr. Prakash, a native of Bangalore, whose store, Jewels India Jewels, was the first on the block to sell intricate gold necklaces and rings that are fashionable in India. \" 'Who would buy this?' they said. Now, look! There are 17 jewelry stores alone. This is like a mecca for Indian people.\" Mixing Vitality and Tension\nThe evolution of 74th Street, which has brought new vitality and new tensions to Jackson Heights, illustrates one way the influx of more than one million immigrants since 1980 has changed a city that is forever shaped and reshaped by immigration.\nFrom the Russians in Brighton Beach to the Dominicans in Washington Heights, the newest newcomers are transforming many of the city's shopping districts. As the immigrants before them did, they are carving out enclaves to cater to their own tastes, creating new versions of Main Street, U.S.A., modeled on the shopping centers they left behind.\nThis time, however, these enclaves represent a breadth of diversity unparalleled in the city's history. In Queens, a borough once exemplified by Archie Bunker but in fact the city's most ethnically diverse, dozens of these enclaves have appeared in the last two decades.\nSome are merely clusters of stores, like the Argentine markets along Junction Boulevard and the West Indian retailers in Jamaica. Others, though, have become fully evolved centers of commerce. There is Little Colombia on the border of Jackson Heights and Elmhurst; the city's second Chinatown on Main Street in Flushing, and the concentration of dozens of Korean shops on Union Street in Flushing. 'The Marvel of New York'\n\"This is the marvel of New York,\" said Eric A. Kober, the director of housing, economics and infrastructure for the city's Planning Department. \"The vitality that allows these neighborhoods to grow -- it is one of the reasons one can be optimistic about the future of the city.\"\nNot everyone, however, agrees. For some longtime residents in Jackson Heights, the flourishing of the Indian stores on 74th Street -- whatever its economic benefits -- has meant the demise of the mom-and-pop shops they considered their own.\nAs the new stores, and the crowds they draw, have grown, these residents have also complained of congestion, noise and litter. Once, three years ago, they even held a protest march down the street. And this fall, when Indian merchants asked the city to recognize the district formally by the name many now call it -- Little India -- their anger surfaced once again.\n\"This used to be an American marketplace,\" said Joseph Gallo, a resident near the strip and one of 700 people who signed a petition opposing the recognition, which the local community board is still considering. \"These merchants have taken over our neighborhood. They have invaded us. And they are just standing there not understanding why we're complaining.\" Accidental Transformation\nThe transformation of 74th Street, which extends from the elevated subway station at Roosevelt Avenue north to 37th Avenue, began almost by accident nearly 20 years ago.\nIn 1973, two merchants, Subhash Kapadia and Nitin Vora, opened an electronics and appliance store, called Sam and Raj, to cater to the demand for appliances that operate on 220 volts (not the United States standard of 110 volts) to take or send back to India.\nMr. Vora said they chose 74th Street because it offered good space and low rent, not to mention the advantage of being at the confluence of subway and bus lines at Roosevelt Avenue and Broadway. Their success soon attracted other Indian merchants, and by the mid-1980's they replaced the older merchants that closed when their leases expired and rents increased.\nThere are now 82 Indian establishments on 74th Street and spilling onto 37th Avenue and 73d Street -- including 12 restaurants, 12 groceries, 17 jewelry stores and at least 20 clothes stores with a dizzying array of names like Sari Palace, India Sari Palace, Taj Sari Palace, Popular Sari Palace and Prince Sari Palace. Even the Key Food supermarket, one of the few more traditional stores on the strip, now sells Indian beer.\nThe transformation has followed a pattern that has occurred around the city for a century, revitalizing shopping strips as older immigrant groups move on, said Frank Vardy, a demographer with the city's Planning Department. \"A couple of successful stores, a couple of theaters or restaurants,\" Mr. Vardy said. \"That's all it takes.\" 95,000 Indians in New York\nMore than 95,000 Indians live in the city -- 56,000 of them in Queens -- but what distinguishes 74th Street from other shopping enclaves, Mr. Vardy said, is that few actually live in the immediate area.\nM. K. Srinivasan, the New York bureau chief of Indian American magazine, said 74th Street attracted the Indian diaspora from the suburbs and even as far away as Massachusetts and Maryland. As an Indian shopping center, he said, it far surpasses smaller enclaves in Chicago and Austin, Tex. \"It's very important to Indians,\" he said. \"It gives us a flavor of home.\"\nThe other day thousands of people -- from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh -- surged over the narrow street lined by squat brick storefronts with a melange of signs. Giri Heda, an engineer who immigrated 22 years ago, had driven to the strip from his home in Windsor, Conn., with a friend visiting from India, Vijay Pareek, who marveled that a part of New York City could be almost indistinguishable from Bombay.\nAs he browsed in Shreeji Groceries, an airy basement store on 74th Street, Mr. Heda explained that at least once a month he stocked up on groceries difficult to find elsewhere: masalas, which are mixtures of spices, desserts like revdis and rossogollas and unusual varieties of lentils and rice. Shopping for Friends\nAnd when he comes, his friends often ask him to pick up things for them. This time, he shopped for five of them. \"We can't get this anywhere else,\" he said, holding several shopping bags. \"When we come, it's one stop.\"\nAt the Menka Beauty Salon, at the corner of 37th Avenue, hairdressers colored hair and shaped eyebrows with string using a deft technique called threading.\nSuseeka Chandrasekar, who works for the Department of Defense, drove two hours from Montville, N.J., to have her hair packed with henna mud, as a love story called \"Apradhi\" (\"Criminal\" in Hindi) played on a television. \"You can't get this everywhere, you know,\" she said.\nFor the most part, 74th Street remains a shopping area only -- the city's largest Hindu temple, for example, is in Flushing -- but the Jackson Heights Merchant Association hopes to expand cultural activities. On Oct. 25, more than 1,500 people, including several members of India's Parliament and Mayor David N. Dinkins, jammed the streets for the neighborhood's first festival celebrating Diwali, the Indian New Year.\n\"My kids, they won't know Diwali,\" said Mr. Vora of Sam and Raj, who now serves as the president of the merchants' association. \"It's still more a commercial place, but we want to start a tradition.\" Alienation and Congestion\nThat effort -- including the request to designate the strip as Little India -- has once again provoked anger among some longtime residents in Jackson Heights. The designation, they say, would increase their sense of alienation, compound the congestion and attract more businesses to a shopping district already saturated.\nThomas Lowenhaupt, a computer publisher who lives on 75th Street at 37th Avenue, has watched the growth of stores with ambivalence. Unlike some residents, he does not speak harshly of the newcomers -- he frequently eats at the restaurants -- but he does worry about the impact, the congestion and litter, the demise of the older mom-and-pop shops.\n\"I don't know where it stops,\" he said. \"I guess there's not much I can do, but just sit back and watch. It's evolution.\""}, {"text": "To Markets! To Markets!\n1993-11-28T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE number eight signifies fortune in Chinese culture, and it is along Eighth Avenue in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, that thousands of recent Chinese immigrants have settled to improve their lot.\nMostly poor and from southern China, they have created a bustling new commercial zone packed with chaotic dim sum palaces, fish markets selling blank-eyed flounder and knots of tiny purple octopus, and stores filled with everything from soybean drinks to children's clothes printed with slogans in awkward English. Elderly people gather in the afternoons at the Brooklyn Chinese-American Association hall to play mah-jongg, while their grandchildren become roadworthy at the Hong Kong Driving School with the help of Cantonese-speaking instructors.\nHere is the same relentless energy as in Manhattan's Chinatown, but with little of the congestion, grime and noise. As an advertisement for the Ocean Palace restaurant declares, \"You'll Never Have to Go to Manhattan Again!\"\nAs a vast new generation of immigrants washes over New York, neighborhoods like Sunset Park are being reinvented according to an age-old pattern: Not simply places to live, they have emerged as marketplaces for this or that ethnic group, shopping and eating centers for communities scattered far beyond neighborhood borders.\nThe Chinese, to be sure, are only one among the major immigrant groups in this city of newcomers, settling not only in Sunset Park and lower Manhattan, but also in Flushing and other parts of northern Queens. Tens of thousands have come, too, from other lands, from the West Indies and the Americas, from South Korea and the Indian subcontinent. And, in Flatbush, in Jackson Heights, in midtown Manhattan, they have created new-world versions of their homeland markets.\nThese are new turns on the places New York at large discovered long ago: Manhattan's Chinatown, Greek Astoria, Arab Atlantic Avenue, to name a few. And until they, too, are appropriated, these marketplaces offer the intrepid shopper or diner that most alluring of New York opportunities: a chance to be among the few who are deeply enough in the know to shop and eat cheap in what, for now, are still relatively out-of-the-way corners of ethnic New York.\n\"There is this whole phenomenon of the neighborhood as quasi-museum, as a repository of ethnic stuff,\" said Philip Kasinitz, a professor of sociology at Hunter College. \"New York promotes that. This city sees itself as the city of immigrants, and the overwhelming majority of the population sees itself as the descendants of immigrants.\"\nWhat follows is a look at five such neighborhoods. Granted, the best shopping in some of these markets is generally of the stocking- or pantry-stuffer variety; you may want to head elsewhere for the Christmas or Hanukkah main event. But there is ample consolation: While everyone else marches along Fifth Avenue during these post-Thanksgiving busiest shopping days of the year, you can be out on Eighth Avenue in Sunset Park, happily stalking a pair of magnetic massage slippers ($7.50 at the Yan Hong Chinese Herbs Company) for that special someone in your life. And you'll eat better, too. CHINATOWN: SUNSET PARK\nThis is the city's newest Chinatown, after Manhattan's and Flushing's. It is just six years old, according to the Census Bureau, and, like many a youngest sibling, Sunset Park is on a constant campaign to assert itself.\n\"There is a saying now,\" said Paul P. Mak, who helped start the nonprofit Brooklyn Chinese-American Association in 1987 and is now its chief executive. \"In Chinatown, they pay the gangs. In Flushing, some people don't pay. And in Sunset Park, not only do they not pay, but they call the police.\"\nThis is not to say, of course, that Sunset Park doesn't have gangs, and fear of gangs. \"Is it perfect up there? No,\" says Sgt. Joe Caramanica, a community-affairs specialist with Patrol Borough Brooklyn South. Still, he calls Mr. Mak's assessment \"pretty accurate.\"\nThe community has shown equal determination in building a neighborhood. Before the Chinese stepped in, Eighth Avenue was largely abandoned, with empty storefronts and buildings sliding into disrepair. As real-estate speculators from Hong Kong drove up rents in Manhattan's Chinatown, many garment factories moved to Brooklyn, and so did the people.\nThe area's Chinese population has more than quadrupled in a decade, to 8,292 in 1990, according to census figures. But Mr. Mak estimates that there are 150 new arrivals every month, legal or illegal, settling around Eighth Avenue between 50th and 62d Streets, the heart of the district.\nA wide two-way street splashed with sunshine, Eighth Avenue caters to working people. Stores stay open late, prices are low, and few of the items for sale are souvenirs. Instead, Sunset Park is a source of low-priced meat, seafood and vegetables, as well as porcelain and consumer electronics.\nA good introduction to the area is the Ocean Palace restaurant, at 5423 Eighth Avenue (not to be confused with Ocean King Seafood Restaurant across the street or Ocean Empire a block away). Specialties are steaming tins of dim sum and Cantonese seafood, and the restaurant often overflows with families, some spanning three generations. For a festive dessert, the Bright Bakery down the block sells dried-fruit-filled moon cakes, an essential snack during autumn holidays celebrating the moon.\nAlthough the local Buddhist temple closed earlier this year, millennia of Chinese tradition are still represented at Yan Hong, an herbal-medicine shop at 5317 Eighth Avenue. A recent import: thick rubber massage slippers, in which are embedded magnets that are said to improve circulation and revive tired feet and legs.\nFor the more contemporary, Kam and An, an appliance store at 5801 Eighth Avenue, flaunts the latest in electronics, like a computerized rice-cooker that can be programmed to produce 10 cups of rice. Kam and An sells another hot local item, a wristwatch with built-in calculator that runs on a lithium battery.\n\"A lot of immigrants here work in restaurants,\" explained Rose Leung, a Kam and An saleswoman. \"But they like to show off.\"\nBy subway: N train to Eighth Avenue. CARIBBEAN FLATBUSH\nOnce a commercial hub of Jewish Brooklyn, Flatbush Avenue has developed a distinctly Caribbean tone in the last 10 years. In the shadow of a 17th-century Dutch Reformed church, behind their Art Deco facades, bakeries do a brisk business in spicy West Indian meat patties and roti, flaky pancakes filled with curry. Boutiques like Montego Bay Fashion thrive while the shell of a former Macy's stands nearby. City buses groan along the avenue while sleek mini-vans, covering much the same route for 25 cents less, zip past.\nThere are some 37,000 Jamaicans, Trinidadians, Haitians and other West Indians living in Flatbush, said Frank Vardy, a demographer for the city's Planning Department. Together with adjacent, more established West Indian neighborhoods like Crown Heights and East Flatbush, they form the city's biggest Caribbean bloc.\nAlong Flatbush Avenue, for six blocks north and south of Church Avenue, much of the merchandise is discounted, most brand-name. At one point, there were so many 99-cent stores that they started going under; now one store proclaims all its wares cost 98 cents. A dozen stores alone carry baby furniture, and probably three dozen sell adults' and children's wear.\nThere's a daily crush at Bobby's Department Store, a sprawling, Darwinian emporium of toys, children's clothes, infant supplies, strollers and cribs. Across the street, Bobby's II offers housewares, games, clothing, furniture and personal-care products, also largely discounted. (A Scrabble set, $20 in a Manhattan toy store, is $12.99 at Bobby's II.)\nFor the island influence, Ragga-Muffin, at 938 Flatbush Avenue, carries suede oxfords in the Rastafarian colors red, yellow and green, as well as sandals and sequin-spangled suits. Down the street, Innovation sells linen fashions with bold lines and cheerful colors, evoking \"what they wear in the islands,\" according to Peach Brown, the Jamaican owner.\nStruggler's Record Inc., a virtual Rasta shrine at 675 Flatbush Avenue, offers rings, bracelets, headbands and other accessories made in Jamaica, all in red, yellow and green. Then there are the hats -- tams, confederates, Boy Blues -- made popular by reggae singers, as well as an abundant supply of hard-to-find LP's by the likes of Bob Marley and Jack Radics.\nWith few restaurants along Flatbush Avenue, many shoppers seem to pause only to devour a meat patty on the run. But among sit-down possibilities are Sybil's of Guyana, 2210 Church Avenue, where the aroma from trans-Caribbean offerings like curried chicken competes with the sweet smell of coco bread coming from Sybil's West Indian Bakery next door.\nAt El Castillo de Jagua, 785 Flatbush Avenue, Cuban sandwiches and hearty fare like octopus stew are served at a spotless counter by Jorge Ramirez, the Dominican-born owner, who keeps his jukebox stocked with Latin hits.\nThe strongest link to the West Indies, though, is to be found at the food stores. The greengrocers are stocked with sweet qunapa, a hard-skinned fruit that's a pale peach color inside and tastes very sweet, and green June plums, a Jamaican favorite eaten raw with a bit of salt or stewed with sugar. At the Sunny Fruit Market, 781 Flatbush Avenue, pods of tamarind, a sour tropical fruit, are piled high beside stacks of green bananas, which are cooked to make a breakfast porridge. There are bottles of hot sauce made in Jamaica or Trinidad and buckets of pigs' tails and snouts, to be simmered with callaloo, a leafy vegetable that tastes like turnip greens.\nGreer Dawes, a medical technologist from Jamaica, picked up a rosy pomegranate while shopping at Sunny the other day. She held it a moment. \"I used to play ball with these,\" she confided. \"When it breaks, you just get another one off the tree.\"\nBy subway: D train to Church Avenue. LITTLE INDIA: JACKSON HEIGHTS\nForeign visitors lugging appliance cartons have become a common sight along 74th Street in this Queens neighborhood. Chances are they're on their way to Kennedy Airport, heading back to Thailand or Bangladesh with a computer, a radio or a toaster that would cost more at home, if available at all.\nMerchants on 74th Street say they like the nickname Little India, a designation yet to be sanctioned by city maps. In 1973, Sam Kapadia and Raj Gandhi opened Sam & Raj at 37-08 74th Street, specializing in home and office equipment that runs on 220-volt current, common everywhere but North America. At the time, they were the only Indians on a street of mostly mom-and-pop stores.\nWithin five years, another Indian-owned business settled in, and these days, 74th Street between Roosevelt and 37th Avenues resembles a mall, a continuum of shops hawking everything from saris to jewelry to imported canned food.\nOn weekends the streets are clogged for two blocks with cars bearing out-of-state license plates, and many stores have toll-free telephone numbers. Nitin Vora, a partner in Sam & Raj, proclaims that the street has become internationally known; in fact, he said, The Times of India, the Bombay daily, once sent a correspondent to interview him.\nMany appliances sold here are not adaptable to American current, but there are plenty of possible purchases elsewhere, with some 20 sari shops and a half-dozen grocery stores in the area. Among the largest are Bhindi Bazaar, at 72-30 37th Avenue, and Patel Brothers, 37-46 74th Street. Both carry sacks of cardamom, red pepper, cumin, coriander and other Indian spices, as well as huge quantities of staples like basmati rice and lentils.\nThere's also a wide variety of dining at modest prices. The Jackson Diner, a no-frills eatery at 37-03 74th Street, serves up rhogan josh, a Kashmiri specialty of spicy lamb, for $8.75. At Maharaj Bhog, a cafeteria-style restaurant, strictly meatless Hindu fare starts at $1.25 a dish.\nBy subway: No. 7 line to 74th Street-Broadway; E, F, G or R to Roosevelt Avenue-Jackson Heights. LITTLE COLOMBIA, ETC.: JACKSON HEIGHTS-ELMHURST\nAt the end of 74th Street, turn east onto 37th Avenue for a true continental shift: within six blocks is an Argentine steakhouse, a Uruguayan coffee shop, a Colombian dress shop where the girls' clothes are masses of ruffles. But the real Latin American heart beats just south, along Roosevelt Avenue between 72d Street on the west and Junction Boulevard on the east. There the music, food and dress of the Americas unfold like brilliantly colored postcards in the darkness beneath the elevated No. 7 subway tracks.\nColombians have the strongest and longest presence here. (Of the 85,000 Colombians counted citywide in the 1990 census, about half live in this part of Queens.) Store names and restaurants recall various cities and regions, from Cali to Cartagena. Many Colombians refer to this section of Roosevelt Avenue as Chapinero, the name of a desirable area in Bogota.\nAlthough the area is a center of the Colombian cocaine-distribution business, Lieut. Noel Webster, community-affairs supervisor for the Queens Borough Patrol, calls it \"relatively safe,\" adding, \"It's not a place that I would stay away from.\"\nFor an introduction to the neighborhood and the culture, Tierras Colombianas, 82-18 Roosevelt Avenue, serves an $8 bandeja campesina, or country platter, of steak, pork, rice, beans, egg, arepa, plantains and avocado -- best accompanied by a mango or passion fruit shake known as a batido.\nDeconstruct the meal nearby at La Colombianita, 84-22 Roosevelt Avenue, a grocer carrying beef cuts, sausage and calves' liver as well as staples like panela (loaves of brown sugar) and various kinds of beans. There are a half-dozen different kinds of arepas, dense biscuits made from yellow or white cornmeal, thick and thin, large and small. The store gives away copies of Noticiero Colombiano, a local weekly with a full page of soccer news.\nThe transplanted national obsession continues in the soccer posters and soccer balls decorating many stores. At one bar, the Flamingo Discoteca, 85-12 Roosevelt Avenue, the owner has set up six big screens for viewing important games.\nStill, while the Colombians may be most numerous in the area, other, and in many cases, newer, Hispanic immigrant groups are making their influence known. At Fiesta Mexico, 87-21 Roosevelt Avenue, products include purple cornmeal from El Salvador, rock salt from Mexico and unhusked barley from Peru. Peruvian specialties like ocopa, a creamy egg-and-cheese dish, are also available at Portal Norteno, 88-11 Roosevelt Avenue.\nCommon to all the cultures: Latin rhythms, piped from nearly every storefront.\nBy subway: No. 7 line to 74th Street-Broadway; E, F, G or R to Roosevelt Avenue-Jackson Heights. KOREATOWN: MIDTOWN\nWhen Jyung-hee Choi paused in his labors long enough to examine the situation, he concluded that his fellow Korean entrepreneurs were putting in so many hours at their jobs that they had no time to appreciate their culture.\nSo, two years ago, he transformed his restaurant, Gam Mee Ok, at 43 West 32d Street in Manhattan, into a mini-gallery for Korean ceramics, paintings and sculptures.\n\"I thought if I exhibited the work here, the Koreans would see it,\" Mr. Choi said.\n\"While they are eating, they can enjoy art, too.\"\nOpen 24 hours, Gam Mee Ok has become a gathering place for artists as well as Korean tourists, businessmen and tae kwan do experts. Mr. Choi's menu features five items, including sul long tang, rice and noodles mixed with a white broth drawn from beef bones that simmer day and night in two huge caldrons at one end of the dining room.\nIn the 1970's, Korean wig-importers set up shop on Broadway between 23d and 34th Streets and quickly became a force in the city's wholesale industry. Korean importers have since expanded into toys, clothing, handbags and costume jewelry, and in the last five years they have made 32d Street the Korean commercial center in New York.\nThese days, the short block between Fifth Avenue and Broadway is a crowded arcade. Korean businesses flourish on this once-dilapidated street, from the towering Korean Commercial Bank of New York to bookstores and supermarkets to the handful of traditional bathhouses, usually identified by signs in only Korean.\nThe Hyang Jong Yi bathhouse is entered through a beauty salon of the same name. On one recent afternoon, half a dozen women were taking saunas or showering in the wide, spotless gray-tiled bath area. Beauty treatments include a Korean facial using a mask of cucumbers, pears and milk. For an extra $20 to $40 (the basic sauna and shower cost $20), female attendants scrub and rinse customers, wash their hair, and give massages with herb-scented oil. The baths are licensed and non-Koreans are welcome.\n\"I'm going into the hospital for an operation,\" explained one client, who was being rubbed with oil from head to toe as she lay across a tiled platform. \"I wanted to feel good. This is really good.\"\nBy subway: B, D, F, N, R or Q to 34th Street."}, {"text": "After Bombay's Violence, Fear and Finger-Pointing\n1993-11-19T05:00:00.000Z\nAmina Bi Abdul Latif carefully adjusted her brown and gold sari over her hair, scrutinized her almost-finished tiny brick and cement house -- the illegal second story still wreathed in rough bamboo scaffolding -- and called to the young man on the roof connecting her to one of the television cable systems in Dharavi, Bombay's largest slum.\n\"Can't you go any quicker?\" she pleaded, a bit of dismay as well as irritation mingling in her voice. Then she turned away.\n\"You see, this house is new,\" she said. \"They burned mine down in January. It was totally destroyed. We are unable to understand why we had to go through this. But even now, at night when we are alone, we are afraid. If we hear a loud sound, we are afraid.\"\nTen months after the worst urban violence in India since independence, Bombay residents are struggling to reassemble their lives, but they are doing so with a sense of foreboding, in an atmosphere that from time to time clouds over with fear.\nThis city's Muslims, some 1 million of Bombay's 12.5 million people, worry that a new spasm of violence could engulf them once again. Hindu militants remain shrill in their condemnation of Muslims, and remain very much a force in this city. And still, in the months that have passed, the killings and arson that brought India's greatest city to its knees remain unsolved. First Rioting, Then Bombings\nIn the last year, Bombay has been racked twice by sectarian violence that claimed hundreds of lives and left tens of thousands homeless. And in March, just as the city was staggering back to life, 13 bombings ripped through Bombay, severely damaging the new stock exchange, destroying apartment blocks and cars and killing 250 people. It is widely believed in Bombay that the bombings were in retaliation for the attacks on Muslims.\nLast December, one day after a rampaging mob of militant Hindus destroyed a 16th-century mosque in Ayodhya, in central India, Bombay's Muslims came out onto the streets in protest and grief. Muslim mobs attacked a police station and burned a Hindu temple. Hindus responded in rage, and then the police subdued the mounting protests with volleys of rifle fire. Most of those who died -- and unofficial estimates range to 600 -- were Muslims.\nAnd then, for nine days in January, a campaign of violence against Muslims swept through, a rampage of burning, looting and killing that spared no part of Bombay. But while the city's elite -- its stock brokers and bankers and lawyers, its writers and film makers -- largely managed to insulate themselves from the destruction, Bombay's poor paid a heavy price.\nIt was in the slums of Jogeshwari, Beherampada and Dharavi that most of the lives were lost, most of the homes were burned and most of the businesses were gutted by looters and arson.\nPerhaps 400,000 people live in Dharavi, a sprawling jumble of broken-down huts patched together from discarded boards and burlap, cardboard and plastic sheeting, as well as sturdier brick and cement houses packed against and on top of one another, all woven by a web of gloomy passageways and alleys.\nBut the scars of violence, the charred beams and vacant lots, the scorched mosques and burned Korans have been cleaned and rebuilt and refurbished.\nTea shops along the main roads are jammed, Hindu crowding shoulder to shoulder against Muslim. Vegetable sellers sit quietly on the edge of roadways, their onions and tomatoes and potatoes piled in neat pyramids on pieces of burlap.\nAfter the violence, the Government announced a judicial investigation. The inquiry drags on day after day in a courtroom in downtown Bombay, at a pace that Massey Rahman, the Bombay bureau chief for India Today, said will insure that it never finishes its task. Unofficial Inquiry Faults the Police\nBut a citizen's organization, the Indian People's Human Rights Commission, pursued its own investigation into the violence. Conducted by two former high court justices, the commission gathered 2,046 statements from witnesses and victims, people from 41 neighborhoods torn by the destruction.\nThe commission put its findings bluntly:\n\"The January riots were an organized crime, perpetrated by the communalists and criminals in connivance with the police,\" the commission found. \"The only way the Hindu psyche could be assuaged would be by a blood bath and razed homes and properties of Muslims.\n\"The police themselves are responsible for the breakdown of law and order. The Government was totally ineffective.\"\nA senior police official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, went further, charging the involvement of the Bharitya Janata Party, the militant Hindu political movement that is the largest opposition group in Parliament.\n\"The police killed Muslims,\" the police official said. \"The Bharitya Janata Party instigated the riots in Dharavi. We could have controlled the riots if we had been allowed. But the police did not fire on Hindu mobs.\n\"The Government is biased. It is a case of 'we are Hindus, for Hindus, of Hindus, by Hindus and only Hindus.' The Muslims have no place.\" System Is Called '99 Percent Corrupt'\nThe officer said the police are so riddled with corruption and sectarianism and so beholden to the interests of the city's politicians that fair and just law enforcement is not possible.\n\"The system here is 99 percent corrupt, even at my rank,\" he said.\"There's nothing like a legal system here, so government officials are a power unto themselves. Even I am very, very powerful. It's very difficult to get justice. You have to buy justice.\"\nAt the center of the Human Rights Commission's report, and at the core of all discussions of sectarian strife here, is Bal Thackeray, the leader of a militant Hindu group called Shiv Sena, or Shiva's Army, after the Hindu god of destruction, one of Hinduism's supreme trinity.\nThe commission declared: \"Bal Thackeray openly claimed that the mobs were under his control. It was he who finally said that, 'A lesson had been taught' and that the Shiv Sainiks should now desist from indulging in violence.\"\nThroughout the violence, Mr. Thackeray's newspaper, Samna, railed against Muslims, urging Hindu thugs to attack Muslims. \"This is a religious crusade,\" his paper wrote.\nIn the 10 months since the pogrom, Mr. Thackeray has defied calls for his arrest and insisted on the transfer of police officials hostile to Shiv Sena.\n\"The question is, who runs Bombay,\" said Alyque Padamsee, the chief executive of Lintas, the country's largest advertising agency, and a noted theater director.\nIn a recent television program broadcast to India by satellite from Hong Kong, Mr. Thackeray boasted of his supporters' role in the violence.\n\"If we had not come forward, Hindus would have been killed,\" he said. \"I am communal. I am provincial. I am regional. Yes, I am. What we Hindus do not get in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Arab nations, that right will not be available to anybody in this country.\" Militant Boasts Of His Influence\nThe Shiv Sena chief also boasted of his power over Bombay and its politicians. \"Shiver they should,\" he said. \"If one is not afraid of a lion, he must fear a rat. I am greatly pleased when those who are in politics shiver with fear.\"\nMr. Thackeray's influence is so pervasive that he has cowed the government of the city and the state of Maharashtra.\n\"We had received intelligence that he was collecting weapons at his headquarters,\" the senior police official said. \"When we said we intended to search his place, the word came down that we could not do so. The Government is afraid of him. We have no guts.\"\nA senior Congress Party politician here, also speaking anonymously because, he said, he feared retribution from Mr. Thackeray, agreed that the Shiv Sena leader could not be touched. \"If we arrested him, there would be violence across this city,\" he said. \"There's nothing we can do. He is too strong.\"\nOn Nov. 7, it was announced that the city's police chief, Amarjeet Singh Samra, had been transferred. Mr. Samra had been known for his efforts to crack down on Shiv Sena violence, and to arrest Shiv Sena politicians who had taken part in the January attacks.\nIn contrast to Hindu militant organizations like Shiv Sena, Sushoba Barwe travels from a middle-class seafront apartment everyday into the slums to try to create a climate of understanding between Hindus and Muslims that will prevent another explosion of violence. Trying to Bring Groups Together\n\"The destruction in Dharavi was tremendous,\" she said. \"In a lot of slum areas, because of a lot of work done by voluntary organizations rebuilding burned down houses, people have come back. Economic recovery has been a bit slower. People found it slow to get loans from government banks. There was a whole schedule to give soft loans from banks to traders and small industries. But we all feel frustrated because this has not come through at all.\"\nMs. Barwe, who works for Moral Rearmament, a social welfare and action group, said she has worked to form the first citizen-police committees in the slums.\n\"The idea is to have all sections, Hindus, Muslims, Christians, students, women, traders, people with some standing, but the rickshaw puller as well, and to put them together with a senior inspector of the police station,\" she said. \"We have four groups so far and we want one in 250 police stations in the city.\n\"We have great expectations for this,\" Ms. Barwe said. \"Unless the people have a chance to meet face to face, they won't have a chance to talk. More rhetoric for communal harmony isn't enough. If we could make these citizens police committees work in the long run, they would help the social fabric of the city.\"\nThe senior police official for Dharavi, Deputy Chief Inspector Sanjay Pandey, said that he supported the efforts of Ms. Barwe and her group, but that he was waiting to see whether there was a longer-term impact. \"Bringing people together, making minds meet, through this we are trying to help,\" he said. \"Let's see how it comes out.\"\n\"There is a calm here now,\" he said. \"But it is a superficial calm. People are living in their own communities, watching, waiting.\""}, {"text": "For Causes of Famine, Look to Overpopulation\n1993-01-28T05:00:00.000Z\nTo the Editor:\nRe \"The Political Causes of Famine: It's Never Fair to Just Blame the Weather\" (Week in Review, Jan. 17):\nThe causes of famine in China, India and Bangladesh were directly related to natural disasters such as flood or drought and exacerbated by too many people competing for too few resources.\nAs a soil scientist, population and public health professional who has lived and worked in Asia and North Africa for most of the last 30 years, I assure you that famine will continue to control population growth so long as populations in Africa double every 18 to 23 years and in Asia every 23 to 32 years.

GILLESPIE President, Population Communication Pasadena, Calif., Jan. 19, 1993"}, {"text": "Ecuadorean Immigrants Finding Obstacles in Their Path\n1993-10-03T05:00:00.000Z\n\"I HOPE to go home someday,\" said the neatly dressed young man. \"The problems of this country are too great for me to stay. There is too much discrimination here.\"\nFrancel Aguirre, a slightly built 27-year-old Ecuadorean, spoke quietly about his life as a member of the village of Ossining's largest group of new immigrants. He was surrounded by the friendly faces of fellow members of his English-as-a-second-language class, in the Ossining School District Office on Croton Avenue.\nThe village of Ossining has one of the largest concentrations of Ecuadoreans in the county; there are also growing populations in Croton-on-Hudson and Peekskill.\nThe teachers of English as a second language had organized a lunchtime party to celebrate their students' progress and allow them to share native foods. The 20 people included a man from Mexico City, a woman from Korea, a woman from Japan and a man from Bangladesh.\nMr. Aguirre said: \"The different races cannot live together here. They must always stay apart. Ecuadoreans are victims of so many things, and we can say nothing. We don't do anything bad. We just work hard, and they give us a hard time.\" Census Figures Analyzed\nOutside the shelter of such institutions as the English-as-a-second-language classroom, Mr. Aguirre and his fellow Ecuadoreans say they are often victims of crime and discrimination.\nAccording to 1990 census figures, the white population in the village of Ossining grew at a rate of 2 percent between 1980 and 1990. The population of nonwhites, as the census report puts it, grew by 44 percent, and the Hispanic population (which can be of any race) increased by 113 percent. By 1990, there were 3,692 Hispanic people in the village, whose population at that time was 22,582. Many village residents estimate that there are at least several thousand Ecuadoreans living and working in Ossining, legally or illegally, making them the largest group of recent immigrants in the village. Of the village's 22,000 or so residents, 4,350 in 1990 were foreign born.\nOssining Union Free School District statistics show that, as of last March, Ecuadorean children represented the largest immigrant group, with 35 newly arrived students in a school population of 3,281. The next largest groups were from Jamaica, Colombia, Peru, Portugal and Haiti. Students who have lived in this country for longer than three years are not counted in the yearly school district new-immigrant census, so the actual number of immigrant students is much higher.\nOfficials at St. Ann's School, one of two Roman Catholic schools in Ossining, also say that their largest group of new immigrants is from Ecuador, with 11 children out of a total of 285 in the last school year.\nBut many Ecuadorean men come to Ossining without their families, work at transitory jobs in landscaping and construction and are uncounted. As large as the Ecuadorean population seems, it is hard to gauge without census designations more specific than \"Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican and other Hispanic\" and without children to be counted in the school census. There were 2,312 \"other Hispanic\" residents in the village, according to the census.\nLike many of them, Mr. Aguirre left his parents, two brothers and a sister at home in Ecuador and has lived with his uncle and brother in an apartment near the Sing Sing Correctional Facility for five years. A baker who works nights, he said he had been denied a green card (the common name for the alien registration card), but he said he would try again.\nThe card is obtained when either a close family member is a legal resident or an employer files a petition with the Immigration and Naturalization Service asking that the person be granted lawful permanent resident status. Some applications are processed quickly. Some are more complicated. Many illegal immigrants fall prey to fraudulent schemes promising a green card.\nMr. Aquirre said he was attacked while walking along Spring Street in the village. His attackers yelled, \"Speak English!\" before roughing him up, he said. He added that banks will not open accounts without Social Security numbers and that Ecuadoreans are frequently beaten and robbed for their savings, which they carry with them.\nAnibal Gonzalez Jr., who is of Puerto Rican descent, is one of two Hispanic police officers in the village of Ossining who have tried to explain American life to the newest Spanish-speaking immigrants. He said, \"If they're going to get into trouble, it's because they're drinking and then driving, or sometimes they wander into certain areas and guys will hassle them.\"\nMr. Gonzalez added: \"We see them with their pockets torn and their faces bloody, or the victims of a car crash, and they refuse medical care. They think the hospitals won't treat their emergency needs.\n\"Or they refuse to report a crime to us. They're afraid of being found out if they're here illegally and being deported. We try to straighten them out and tell them that they have to trust the system a little more.\"\nReacting to the Ecuadoreans' fear of authority, Dr. Emil Nigro, director of emergency medicine at the Phelps Memorial Hospital Center in neighboring North Tarrytown, said, \"We never, never turn anyone away.\" He said that not only does his emergency room evaluate everyone who comes to them and treat them if needed but that it also does not require identification or insurance. Only a few simple questions are asked at admission and, Dr. Nigro added, \"All records are confidential.\" He added that in most cases hospitals must absorb the cost of emergency room visits by illegal aliens.\nDiego Santiago, a Colombian-born police officer who lives in Ossining, has visited St. Ann's Roman Catholic Church on Eastern Avenue to tell Hispanic men how to protect themselves. St. Ann's is known as the immigrants' church in the community.\n\"Walk in groups, never alone,\" Officer Santiago said. \"Don't drink to drunkenness. Don't carry large amounts of cash. Don't be afraid of the police.\" The Rev. Frank Oliverio has told these groups that they may feel free to keep their strongboxes with their savings in his rectory, just across the street from St. Ann's. About 350 Hispanic families attend the Spanish Masses at St. Ann's, but the church also offers special Masses in Italian, Portuguese and Korean. St. Ann's also serves many second- and third-generation Irish-Americans and Italian-Americans.\nFather Oliverio said he hopes to form a support group for Ecuadoreans and other Hispanic men in this country without their families.\nNot all Hispanic men are disillusioned. Luis Pani, a 31-year-old laborer, said he has never been assaulted. \"Maybe that's why I'm so happy here,\" he said. Although he has been unsuccessful in obtaining a green card, Mr. Pani, a bachelor, has formed a network of friends and made a life for himself in Ossining. He has become active in St. Ann's Church and has become a familiar and popular figure in his English-as-a-second-language classes.\n\"America is a country of green fields, blue-eyed blond girls, wonderful summers and houses with green gardens and lawnmowers,\" he said. \"That is my dream, to have a house in the suburbs, a wife, a couple of kids and a lawnmower that can blow the leaves in the fall.\"\nMarcia Siguenza, an Ecuadorean who recently moved to North Tarrytown after nine years in Ossining, worries about the social havoc caused by the mostly male migration from Ecuador. \"It is sad, very sad,\" she said. \"The men are coming to this country without their wives. Sometimes they remarry here, but it is not really a marriage. They do this because it helps them get a green card.\n\"It is breaking up the families in Ecuador. In some places in southern Ecuador, there are no men, only women. And there are bad men who are selling visas for too much, $4,000, which takes many years to pay off with interest.\"\nMs. Siguenza, who has an Alien Registration Card, the so-called green card, is the supervisor of housekeeping at Kings College in Briarcliff. Her four grown children have done well in life, she said. But she said she failed to understand why so many young Ecuadorean men chose this country over their own. \"They have a nice, simple life in Ecuador,\" she said. \"Maybe not with TV or cars. But there's too much here. It's a big transformation for them, and they're not really ready for it. They come mostly from the farms, from the countryside.\"\nJose and Zoila Illescas have four children they left in Ecuador in the care of grandparents. The Illescases are both working, he in construction and she as a housecleaner. They have green cards and eagerly await the day they can afford to bring their children to the United States. An Unofficial Protector\nCarlos Castro, a constable and court officer, is a second-generation Colombian-American who has lived in Ossining for 25 years. He is an unofficial protector and adviser to the newest Hispanic immigrants who end up in the village courtroom. He said he is appalled by their living conditions. \"Many homes have them stacked up inside,\" Mr. Castro said. \"But you wouldn't know it from the street.\"\nFrank Vardy, an immigration authority from the New York City Department of City Planning, suggested that the Ecuadoreans are similar to the immigrant groups who preceded them. Those Ecuadoreans who choose to return to their native country are \"much like the Italian 'birds of passage' from the late 1800's and early 1900's,\" he said.\n\"Those men came and lived cheaply and sent money home to the wife and children,\" Mr. Vardy said. \"Then, after 5 or 10 years, they went home with a bankroll and bought a farm or opened up a business.\"\nDespite his steady job as a baker, Mr. Aguirre said he has been disillusioned and feels estranged. He added that he must continue working hard, living simply and watching his back if he is ever to be able to return home with anything to show for his time here."}, {"text": "Hindu Rage Against Muslims Transforming Indian Politics\n1993-09-17T05:00:00.000Z\nSlowly, gradually, but with the relentlessness of floodwaters, a growing Hindu rage toward India's Muslim minority has been spreading among India's solid middle class Hindus -- its merchants and accountants, its lawyers and engineers -- creating uncertainty about the future ability of adherents of the two religions to get along.\nAlong with their hostility toward Muslims, Hindus are gripped by more and more anxiety about who they are, where they are going and what is going to be there in the end.\nOne result of the unease is that in the last four years, India's political landscape has shifted profoundly. The Congress Party, which led the country to freedom from the British, is disintegrating amid charges of corruption, incompetence and the collapse of its grass-roots organization. A Major Political Force\nAnd in its place is rising a party of revivalist Hinduism, the Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P. Hindu nationalism has surged and ebbed through this century, but never before has it manifested itself as a major political party.\nThe party has grown, from a handful of seats in Parliament just a few years ago, to become the country's largest opposition party, one that many people believe could end the long rule of the Congress Party.\nIf an election were held today, according to a recent poll by India Today, the country's foremost news magazine, the B.J.P. would come within 32 seats of Congress Party in Parliament; today that gap is 130 seats. Only two years ago, the party held only two seats in Parliament. An Appeal to Prejudices\nBut it has grown not merely by pointing to the weaknesses of the Congress Party, but more important, and more effectively, by pitting Hindus against Muslims, by appealing to widespread and deeply seated Hindu prejudices.\nDeep in the sprawling suburbs of southern New Delhi, for example, where jumbles of cement-walled houses crowd into one another like a clutter of wooden blocks spilled from a bag, Dhirendra Kumar Bhatia settled himself behind a scarred metal desk in his television shop. An overhead fan futilely stirred the city's baking air.\n\"I am a Hindu,\" he declared \"When you are a Hindu, people should not be ashamed to call themselves Hindu. They were not so assertive about being Hindus.\"\n\"Hindus were a majority,\" he said, resorting to the past tense typical of much of Indian spoken English, \"but they were not given their rights.\" Echoing the comments of others, he said the Congress Party had appeased and catered to Muslims.\nHe acknowledged that India's 105 million Muslims pose no real threat to the dominance of India's more than 700 million Hindus, but insisted they are the root of many of India's problems. 'An Indian First'\n\"Yes, they're a minority,\" he said. \"But even a small thing can disturb a large thing. A dirty fish in a big pond can dirty the water. They must know they are an Indian first, and a Muslim later. They must be taught to be loyal to India. The B.J.P. can help them do this.\"\nB.J.P. leaders have never discussed in detail what policies they would pursue if they came to power. But in public statements and conversations, certain of their policies are clear.\nAt the top of the B.J.P. agenda is to declare India a nuclear-weapons state, a decision they say would enhance the country's international stature. The party would also sharply restrict foreign investment, particularly in consumer goods and services. Instead, party leaders profess, only high-tech investments would be permitted. Fast-Rising Population\nThe party appears unconcerned about India's growing population, now 880 million and increasing by 2.1 percent annually. A poll of B.J.P. legislators found that only 2 percent regarded population control as necessary.\nEven India's high illiteracy rate -- more than half the population cannot read -- is not a dominant concern of the party. On the other hand, party leaders have promised that they would subject Muslims to a common civil code.\nSince independence and partition with Pakistan in 1947, India's Government has professed an allegiance to a broad secular idea, one that at least formally did not favor Hindus over Muslims. But for many Hindus, the B.J.P. represents both an assertion of Hindu identity and a revival of a culture that they believe has been trampled by modernity and corrupt politics. The Rule of Hindus\nFor them, this idea is embodied in the idea of the Hindu raj, the rule of Hindus -- sometimes called the Ram raj after the Hindu deity named Ram. It is a reign in which Hindus would control Indian life and Government, where Hindu religious customs and practice would suffuse society and where Islam would be in retreat.\n\"I am not a religious person myself,\" said Lal Krishna Advani, the party president. \"But at the same time, talking about Ram, talking about Ram raj, that makes any person, whether he subscribes to ritual or not, whether he subscribes to a swami or not, whether he belongs to a cult or not, feel that it is something elevating.\"\nFor many Hindus, the onset of the Ram raj began in December in the north Indian town of Ayodhya, when hundreds of young men, part of a crowd of more than 100,000, clambered over steel pipe and barbed wire fences and, with sledge hammers, crow bars and their bare hands, began destroying an undistinguished 16th century mosque. In a matter of hours, the three-domed structure was reduced to a pile of rubble.\nThe mosque was erected during the reign of the first Mogul emperor, Babur, whose conquest of India is regarded by Hindu militants as a period of repression. Conversion to Islam\nAfter centuries of Mogul rule, Muslims -- descendants of both conquerors or converts -- were scattered throughout the subcontinent, in cities, towns and villages, mingling easily with the majority Hindu population. Over the course of hundreds of years, many lower-caste and outcast Hindus converted to Islam to escape virulent social discrimination.\nToday, although Muslims can be found in all walks of life, from Cabinet ministers to bankers, farmers and washermen, in general Muslims are poorer and less educated than Hindus.\nFollowing the destruction of the mosque in December, thousands of Muslims and Hindus died violently across northern India. For Muslims, the destruction of the mosque seemed to demonstrate the precariousness of their situation, whereas many Hindus viewed the demolition as a reassertion of Hindu pride. 'A Product of Frustration'\n\"It's a product of disillusionment with the Congress Party, a product of frustration, a product of despair, of those who have nothing but their Hindu identity,\" said Karan Thapar, a leading television producer in New Delhi.\nIndia escaped British colonial rule, not in peace as Mohandas K. Gandhi, the independence leader, had wished, but in a sea of blood when Hindus massacred Muslims and Muslims massacred Hindus.\nFor virtually all of India's 46-year post-colonial history, it has been the political, and genetic, descendants of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister, who have governed the country in the cloak of the Congress Party.\nBut India's agglomeration of castes, linguistic groups and most importantly its Hindu-Muslim divide, required a political strategy that would assure support from the disparate sectors of Indian society.\nA turning point came in 1986, when Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, the grandson of Nehru, moved to shore up his party's weakening support among restless Muslims by pressing Parliament into canceling a Supreme Court decision that ordered a Muslim man to pay alimony to his ex-wife.\nUnder some interpretations of Islamic law, Muslim men are not permitted to provide financial support for an ex-wife after a divorce. In 1978 a Muslim named Shah Bano sued her husband for support after their divorce. Eight years later, the case percolated to the Supreme Court, which ruled that Indian law required alimony, superseding Muslim custom.\nHundreds of thousands of angry Muslims quickly protested what they saw as a violation of promises given over the years that their religious law would not be curbed by the state. Worried about Muslim support, Rajiv Gandhi had the Parliament change the law to void the court's ruling.\nIf there was a single moment that ignited the fortunes of Hindu politics and politicians, they point to this. Until then, despite persistent tension between Hindus and Muslims, often leading to rioting, the B.J.P. (organized in 1980) and its predecessor parties, had not been successful. Growth of Hindu Party\nIndeed, in 1986, the B.J.P. held only two seats in Parliament. In the elections of 1991, they won 119, about 20 percent of the house's seats.\n\"Since then there has been a very perceptible change in the mood of the people,\" said Mr. Advani. \"His decision to amend the law, to undo the Shah Bano decision of the Supreme Court -- which seemed very logical to everybody -- it was a shock.\"\nThe B.J.P. also castigated Rajiv Gandhi for banning Salman Rushdie's book \"The Satanic Verses,\" and attacked Muslims' insistence on Islamic schools for their children.\nAmong the B.J.P.'s supporters, for example, is Dr. Jipendra Kumar Tyagi, who works in a government hospital, struggles on an inadequate salary, and is convinced the party is the country's only salvation. He lives not in the leafy enclaves of New Delhi's overseas-educated elite, but across the Jumna River in a small apartment carved from a concrete block, of a type that makes up much of middle class housing. What irks him is his perception of Muslims as privileged.\n\"There should be a uniform civil code, not like Shah Bano,\" he said. \"That was done by Rajiv Gandhi just to appease the Muslims.\"\nHindu nationalism did not spring from nowhere, having risen and fallen many times over the years. In 1925, a group of Hindu nationalists disillusioned with the secularist approach of Indian leaders formed an organization called the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or National Volunteer Corps, known as the R.S.S.\nThe corps stressed physical training, discipline and anti-Muslim attitudes. Its ideological godfather, Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar, spoke of Muslims as \"foreign elements\" who should be absorbed or driven out, adding that Nazi Germany offered \"a good lesson for us in Hindustan to learn and profit by.\"\nThe R.S.S. spawned many organizations, including the B.J.P.\nIndia's Muslims, not surprisingly, see themselves as the potential victims of the resurgent Hinduism. Tahir Mahmood, who heads the department of Islamic and Comparative Studies at the Indian Institute of Islamic Studies, articulated a widely held view.\n\"I think there is a very large group of citizens in India who say that if there can be two Muslim-dominated states in the subcontinent\" -- Pakistan and Bangladesh -- \"then this third country should be dominated by another religion. Unfortunately, a majority believe this. Destruction of Mosque\n\"I wouldn't call the gap between Muslims and Hindus absolutely unbridgeable,\" added Mr. Mahmood. \"But we are centuries behind what the U.S. and the U.K. have achieved.\" Of the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque, he said: \"It seems to be a reintroduction of might is right.\"\nLess educated, but equally alarmed members of India's Muslim community, are increasingly apprehensive. But they seem to adhere, much as fervent supporters of the B.J.P. maintain, to their independent lives, to an existence deliberately distinct from the Hindu society around them.\nSayed Azgar Ali runs a small fabric store in a largely Muslim area of Bombay. He wears the skull cap of the devout, as well as a long, black beard.\n\"The main aim of the B.J.P. is a special hatred against Muslims,\" he said. \"If they come to power, there will be fewer services for Muslims.\" He said that the sharia, or Muslim law, used by Muslims to settle disputes among themselves, will be endangered.\nFor Dhirendra Kumar Bhatia, the New Delhi television dealer, the problem is that Muslims are different.\n\"Unless someone is there to make them see what is wrong, they will not see,\" he said of Muslims. \"The B.J.P. can provide that understanding. They can become the big brother to help people understand. And then this problem will be permanently solved.\""}, {"text": "Java Journey: From Chaos To Serenity\n1993-03-07T05:00:00.000Z\nDURING YOUR VISIT TO JAKARTA, IF you stay at the Borobudur Inter-Continental Hotel, you will be well placed to observe the remarkable blend of religions and cultures, one superimposed upon another, that characterizes Java today. At the hotel, which is named for one of the world's most exquisite Buddhist temples, you will gently come awake each morning to the sound of chanting from the nearby Istiqlal mosque, said to be the second largest outside Mecca. Most likely, these haunting songs of devotion, so like a distant call to some part of yourself long forgotten, will pull you toward your balcony and out into the humid heat of the bustling Indonesian capital. There, as you peer at the perpetually busy street below -- crowded with Japanese cars, motorcycles and the bicycle rickshaws called becaks -- and at the gleaming skyscrapers that rise above the traffic's fumes, you will see yet another aspect of a dizzyingly diverse island.\nI had come to Java with my wife, Joan, for a two-week stay, in part to give a series of lectures on multiculturalism in American literature. But my interest in Java was more than academic; as a student of philosophy and the martial arts and as a Buddhist layman, I had for years wanted to experience the East at first hand. But nothing had prepared me for the sensory overload that we were to encounter daily, or for the rich history of an island where man had lived since the Pleistocene epoch -- some 500,000 years.\nJakarta today is, after Hong Kong and Dacca, Bangladesh, the third most densely populated city on earth, about 130,000 people a square mile -- more than nine million. Spreading up from the port at the mouth of the Ciliwung River, it is a city of contrasting neighborhoods, where tree-lined residential boulevards push up against modern office buildings and shantytowns. For several centuries -- from about the end of the 12th to early in the 16th -- there was a trading center for the Hindu kingdom of Sunda on this site; Buddhism, which had also been brought from India, thrived. Islam arrived in about 1527, with an alliance of Javanese sultans who conquered the port. From the 17th century on, the city was the domain of the Dutch, the administrative center of what was then called the Dutch East Indies.\nSince I am a black American who has written on slavery, I was curious about the colonial period, inaugurated in the 17th century, in which existed a system of forced agricultural labor that resembled the plantation system of the American South. One of our first excursions was therefore a tour of Old Jakarta (once called Batavia), where, in Taman Fatahillah Square, the solemn Dutch City Hall and prison stands, white and heavily burdened by its bloody history, its front door guarded by a huge iron cannon called Si Jagur, or Mr. Sturdy. (In times past, Indonesian women touched this relic of colonial power to insure their fertility.)\nTaman Fatahillah Square was the center of Batavia, and also its killing ground, where criminals and rebels were flogged or executed. Today it is the site of a daily market housed in flimsy structures so frail that one wonders how they remain standing during the winter monsoons. There are row upon row of open-air shops and cluttered stands where clothing and bicycle parts, straw hats, Coca-Cola and fruit are for sale. Everyone -- even children -- has something to sell, but in general, the street shops seem gathering places for people to chat and watch the passage of humanity.\nIn contrast to the activity of the square, the Dutch City Hall, now the Old Batavia Museum, has the feel of a mausoleum -- it is cool, or cooler than the street inside, but the air is still. The museum, housed in a balconied two-story building that was completed in 1710, is sparsely furnished. The light slanting in through its two rows of square windows is dim even at midday, and the high-ceilinged rooms loudly echo your footsteps as you move, fascinated yet faintly appalled, through spick-and-span chambers once occupied by Dutch bureaucrats who had the power of life and death over the Javanese.\nI have been to beautiful, canal-threaded Amsterdam and seen the progressive, tolerant way of modern Dutch life. But here, in the centuries-old City Hall, with its lightless basement prison cells that seemed more like crawl spaces than rooms, I slowed my step little by little, trying to glimpse, however briefly, something of Dutch behavior in Java: to place imaginatively behind the dark oak table, on the uncomfortable-looking iron bed or on one of the high-backed, elaborately carved thronelike chairs a human being capable of administering the cruel Cultivation System. Such a man would have lured Malayan men from their villages with promises of gambling, money and women, then held them as chattel on his plantation until, perhaps, one of them picked up a sharp-edged dagger and ran amok before he was brought down. The word \"amok\" is Malay in origin, and for me, its genesis could be traced to the orderly, half-empty rooms through which we wandered, and to the Dutch governors and generals whose 18th-century headstones, in the courtyard, I touched, ever so tentatively, running my fingers across their names: \nGustaaf Willem Baron van Imhoff \n. . . \nJohan van \nHoorn\n. . . . The jolly parties in murals we saw at the nearby Jakarta Museum, depicting Dutchmen in their blue uniforms joking with their wives as Muslim servants brought them food, could not be conjured from the sterile, speechless City Hall itself, which remains -- in the midst of the lively square -- a place of phantoms from Indonesia's tormented past.\nBeyond the City Hall, beyond our exploration of the long night of colonialism, which ended in 1949, we found a people at ease with their cultural treasures and eager to share them. For Indonesians, a source of pride are their gorgeous puppet plays, called wayang, developed into an art of the highest sophistication. The Wayang Museum, nine rooms in an old house just off Taman Fatahillah Square, offers a feast of puppets from West, Central and East Java and all around the world. The Javanese puppets are of two kinds: wayang kulit, or shadow puppets, made of intricately profiled and perforated leather, and the brightly colored, fully costumed, delicately carved wooden puppets called wayang golek. Most represent the heroes, gods and demons of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the great Hindu epics, but a few are drawn from modern Indonesian history, including stylized portraits of such nationalist leaders as Sukarno and Mohammed Hatta. A few puppets, made by master dalangs, or puppet makers, were for sale, and I bought a wooden figure of Prince Arjuna, the ladies' man hero of the Mahabharata who is a favorite among Indonesians old and young. \nAlthough several of the museums around Taman Fatahillah Square can be toured in a single morning or afternoon, a full day -- or even more -- is required for a visit to Taman Mini, a vast (300-acre) complex about six miles southeast of Jakarta that offers the entire country in miniature. At this theme park, a sort of Indonesian Disneyland, you can sample the varied architecture of Indonesia's 27 provinces, from a medieval Hindu castle, protected on either side by 15-foot-high stone guardians, to a simple, airy Batak house (remove your shoes before entering). When you need to rest -- and you will need to, given the size of Taman Mini -- there are formal gardens that are illuminated at night. Because Taman Mini so resembles a Hollywood backlot, it is a natural location for the country's film makers. During our trip, we had the good fortune to come upon actors at work in a costume drama, where I was able to watch an actress using silat -- a fighting art as varied and complex as Chinese kung fu, which some of its variants resemble.\nAfter a week in Jakarta, we flew to Jogjakarta, about 300 miles southeast of the capital. Jogja, as it is often called, is Java's center of traditional culture, the place to shop for batik and other crafts and to see classical dance and warang performances. A city of three million, set among green fields at the base of volcanic Mount Merapi, it is the site of the Royal Kraton, an 18th-century palace, a walled complex that encloses mosques, markets, workshops and even living quarters for the former sultan and his family. Its chief building, the Golden Pavilion, combines Hindu, Buddhist and Islamic influences in a way that is wholly Javanese.\nWe checked into the Santika Hotel, a comfortable lodging where, on each evening during our visit, a gamelan orchestra made up of instruments something like a xylophone, accompanied by gongs and other percussion instruments, played traditional music in the lobby. In the desk in our room, as at the Borobudur Inter-Continental, we found a copy, in English and Japanese, of The Teachings of Buddha. Since we planned to use Jogja as a center for several excursions in the vicinity, we decided to hire a guide, and early the next morning the hotel manager introduced us to a young Muslim student, Ali. He led us to his van, and then patiently spent most of the day driving us to the markets and small factories where we purchased, at surprisingly reasonable prices, subtly colored wax-resist batik paintings.\nThe next day Ali drove us to Borobudur, just 25 miles northwest of Jogja. The Borobudur temple is the largest Buddhist monument on earth, incorporating, by some estimates, more than two million cubic feet of stone.\nBuilt between A.D. 778 and A.D. 856 by order of a ruler of the Sailendra Dynasty, whose name is now unknown, the monument rises majestically above coconut plantations and terraced rice paddies. Thousands of workers labored to raise its nine superimposed terraces on a site defined by a mountain range and two bluish-gray rivers bordered by wild, impenetrable vegetation. Mysteriously, however, the temple was abandoned and this area of Java depopulated around A.D. 919. Then Mount Merapi erupted, covering Borobudur in volcanic ash. It remained hidden for a thousand years, sheltered by mountains and jungle growth, until it was rediscovered in 1814, during the short British colonial period when Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles was lieutenant governor of Java. The Dutch began restoring the site about a century later, and the job was finished less than a decade ago by the Government of Indonesia, with international aid.\nAlthough food stalls and souvenir shops are set at a respectful distance from the monument, children, the ubiquitous salesmen of Java, were waiting at the entrance when Ali pulled his van up to Borobudur. Suddenly, they were on us -- the obvious foreigners -- shouting, \"Mister, look here! Mister, you want buy postcards!\" and waving their wares. I bought from one boy, and was surrounded. Finally, I bought from all of them (Ali only smiled and shook his head), then turned as they moved en masse toward the next visitor, to behold -- with my breath caught high in my chest -- the first, mind-silencing view of the temple.\nThrough the open gate, up four levels of steep stairs, we climbed quietly through that enormous work of sculpture, a spiritual triumph that crests the steep hill like a crown. Like the other travelers -- Chinese, European, Indian and Indonesian -- just before and behind us, we lowered our voices as the spell of Borobudur took hold. I became increasingly aware that all things within its view were sacred, including speech -- especially speech -- which had to pass through the three traditional, time-honored Buddhist tests or gates (Is it true? Is it necessary? Will it cause harm?) or not be uttered at all. That day the visitors to Borobudur were from all points on the compass; we did not know each other's names, but as we tried to penetrate the temple's mystery -- as it penetrated us -- I suspect we all must have felt that where we came from, what distinguished us, was far less important than the deep chord of commonality this monument forced us to recall.\nThe design of the temple leads the traveler up three levels that symbolize the journey to enlightenment. The lowest sphere, Kamadhatu, represents the region of desire and the transitory nature of all things. Next comes Rupadhatu, the level of bodhisattvas -- enlightened ones -- who have cast off desire and dualism but still inhabit earthly form. Finally, one ascends the steep, cracked stairs, eroded by rain and discolored by fungus, to find the third sphere, Arupadhatu, which stands for Nirvana. Ringing the temple, unfolding like a scroll, are bas-reliefs, some 1,500 sculptures that constitute a pictorial narrative of Buddha's life. There are 504 bell-shaped stupas, and each at one time contained a statue of Gautama seated in the lotus posture. At the temple's highest point is a towering main stupa, empty because, as one explanation has it, the Nothingness it symbolizes, and from which all things arise, is simply beyond conceptualization.\nJava, of course, is an island so rich in Buddhist, Hindu and Muslim shrines that one can barely turn without bumping into one. Leaving Jogjakarta, we detoured 10 miles to the northeast to visit the Hindu temples of Prambanan, probably erected between A.D. 800 and 1000 and destroyed by earthquakes in the 17th century. Restoration, begun by the Dutch in the 1930's, is still going on. \nThe chief temples at Prambanan are a shrine to Shiva, flanked by smaller temples dedicated to Vishnu and Brahma. Their lightless rooms harbor broken statues of Hindu gods -- among them four-armed Lord Shiva and his son, elephant-headed Ganesa -- while their walls, corridors and stairways display an entire universe of Vedic creatures who dance and promenade, pray and beckon us to a past, a place, where the holiness of Brahma, who has 33 million representations, was manifest in every man, every animal, every molecule of matter. The reliefs of the main temple show scenes from the Ramayana, and it is at Prambanan, on nights of the full moon between May and October, that the epic is performed outdoors by dancers whose gestures have been influenced by the stylized movements of the puppet theater.\nNonetheless, it was Borobudur that brought my wife and me a sense of closure and consummation to our journey across Java. To visit there is to share, however briefly, the peace promised by the philosophy it so magnificently honors. The tranquillity bestowed upon us by the great temple was enough to last us for the rest of our journey, even when we returned to the noise and bustle of 20th-century Jakarta.INDONESIAN INTERLUDE\n IN GENERAL \nJava offers accommodations ranging from the very cheap (simple losmen, or guest houses catering largely to backpackers) to those of international standard and commensurate price. The following hotels are geared to Western visitors.\nIn the Jakarta hotels, an Indonesian dinner for two (which might include satay, coconut soup and nasi goreng, a spicy-fried rice dish served with chicken or seafood and pickled vegetables) is $40 to $50 with wine or beer; in Jogjakarta, $25 to $35.\nFurther information is available from the INDONESIA TOURIST PROMOTION OFFICE (telephone: 213-387-2078), 3457 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, Calif. 90010.\n JAKARTA \nHOTEL BOROBUDUR INTER-CONTINENTAL (62-21-370333, or in the United States, 800-327-0200), Jalan Lapangan Banteng Selatan, is set in 23 acres of gardens in the center of the city.

The answer: A gun. In the former Yugoslavia all the guns have been taken down from their walls. Now their clamor is heard in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Where will it be heard next?\n\"Sarajevo: A War Journal\" consists of 59 entries written between April 25, 1992, and Aug. 18, 1993, by Zlatko Dizdarevic, an editor of Sarajevo's only remaining daily newspaper, Oslobodenje (Liberation). Mr. Dizdarevic is a Muslim married to a Serb. But I shouldn't point to his ethnic background. He is a Sarajevan. Before the siege, Sarajevo was a city where the peoples of three different religions lived together in peace. They intermarried, worked together, attended concerts together in a city of more than 600,000 souls, one of the loveliest in Europe.\nIt was hard to begin this book, not because of its writing, which is wonderful (and gracefully translated from the French edition by Anselm Hollo), but because of the slaughter I imagined it contained. I was mistaken. Its subject is not slaughter but endurance -- the endurance of an integrated population -- although slaughter is there for any who want it. Since the Bosnian Serbs began their siege of Sarajevo nearly 600 days ago, more than 10 percent of its people have been killed or wounded by the shelling and sniper fire.\nI also thought this book would be about Muslims, Croats and Serbs fighting one another, but it is more important than that. It is about the idea of multiculturalism and religious coexistence pitted against the worst kind of chauvinism.\n\"It has taken a lot for us to realize why we've been made into sacrificial animals,\" writes Mr. Dizdarevic. \"Because somebody somewhere decided that the bestial concept of a herd composed of only one color, all speaking the same language, all thinking along similar lines, all believing in the same god, must wipe out everything else.\"\nIN May 1989 I visited Sarajevo to read my poems with some other American poets. I knew Sarajevo only from the 1984 Winter Olympics and because it was the place where a young Serb named Gavrilo Princip had shot the Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914.\nI was amazed by the beauty of the place: its coffee shops and outdoor cafes and wonderful restaurants, its handsome 19th-century buildings and its parks full of trees. I was amazed at how popular poetry appeared to be. Now the trees have been cut down for firewood, the buildings have been destroyed, the restaurants that re-main have no food. But a few poets, like Avdo Sidran, still send their insolent and defiant verse toward the snipers on Trebevic Mountain. In a so-called normal world such events would be called surreal. In Sarajevo the surreal has become banal. As Mr. Dizdarevic constantly proves, the most preposterous event can be topped the next day by something even more preposterous.\nCertainly there are enemies in this book, such as Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, and Maj. Gen. Lewis W. MacKenzie, a Canadian who was in charge of the United Nations forces at the Sarajevo airport. Mr. Dizdarevic accuses General MacKenzie of shutting his eyes to the atrocities of the Serbs. And did General MacKenzie know that his own soldiers were accepting bribes to give escaping Sarajevans a ride out of town in United Nations vehicles? But there are also villains among the Bosnians, \"professional patriots\" killing in the name of a new Inquisition. And there are American and European politicians who turn their backs and hope this nuisance will disappear.\nBut this isn't a book about politics. \"Why should we take an interest in politics,\" writes Mr. Dizdarevic, \"when it was politics that led us into this disaster, and when our rare moments of happiness -- or at least our ordinary, normal moments -- can only be found in the details of our daily lives, such as they are?\"\nThe question is: What is it to be a \"normal\" human being? And how can this so-called normality be defended against the depredations of the world? The Serbian gunners do not like Mr. Dizdarevic. His fellow reporters and photographers have been killed. Again and again the offices of the newspaper have been destroyed by shells and new offices had to be found.\n\"But what we'll neither forgive nor forget,\" he says,\"is that they have broken what was best in us; they have taught us to hate.\"\nWhat is also horrible is what one gets used to, like the horror that defines a good day as one during which snipers and shelling have caused only 10 deaths and a dozen injuries.\n\"Why did we think this 'couldn't happen anywhere in the world'?\" asks Mr. Dizdarevic. \"Why were we taught that there is an order to things on this terrestrial sphere? And why has this happened now? Because the 'order of things' was buried in Sarajevo. It is the grandest and saddest funeral that has taken place on this planet in decades. Not because of the number of victims, but for the enormity of a whole mountain of irredeemably buried ideals.\"\nLast year I taught the \"Iliad\" to a group of students at Syracuse University. In thinking about Sarajevo and Troy, I was struck by the fact that human barbarity had changed little in 3,000 years. The only difference seemed the contemporary lack of heroism. Yet Mr. Dizdarevic proved me wrong about this as well. His book is full of heroes, but they are ordinary people, cabdrivers and bus drivers transporting people at no charge into the most dangerous areas. People risking their lives to help others. \"It is people who matter,\" he writes, \"not the war; what remains important is the will, the faith, the inner strength undreamed of in peacetime, all those things that can give birth to defiance, perseverance, solidarity and knowledge.\"\nThe little fascist who lives somewhere within me argues that everybody in the world must read this book. It is not just Sarajevo; it is the idea. If it can happen there, it can happen anywhere. And if Sarajevo falls, what will happen to Kosovo and Macedonia? Reading this book one sees how much writing and popular entertainment exist to keep us from thinking about the world, which can be awfully nasty to think about. But isn't that how we will lose the world? Those who turn their backs on Sarajevo, aren't they also guilty of its destruction? A man whose 3-year-old daughter is killed by a Serbian sniper says, \"One day her tears will catch up with him.\" Perhaps they will catch up with us all.\n\"This is not a war,\" Mr. Dizdarevic declares. \"This is a horror that has no name. It is a black hole in the spectrum of all reasoned thought.\"\nListen, even as you read these words the shelling continues in Sarajevo. The single blessing is that Zlatko Dizdarevic still bears witness to it. His message is the same one expressed by W. H. Auden: \"We must love one another or die.\"The Logic of Chaos \n 10 June 1992\nThis morning, a little after 5, a general alert was sounded. It is now almost 9, and the alert is still in effect.\nWhile the earth shakes, I note how irrational it is to speak of \"general\" danger. How ridiculous it is to wait for the \"all clear,\" the end of danger, when days and nights in Sarajevo are all the same, when the city has been gutted. Here, danger has become permanent, and suffering inevitable. Nothing but uncertainty is certain. How could one define its beginning or end? There will be a definitive end to it all, and what that end will be is a matter of chance, in every case.\nIn these hours, days and months, in which all of life depends on nothing but (mis)fortune, we find ourselves imperceptibly moving in new directions. At other times, in other places, these new directions might seem ridiculous.\nNew philosophies are born, designed for ourselves and our loved ones. Their objective is to guarantee survival, to protect oneself from oneself and one's fears. After a shell -- one of dozens -- exploded close by, I overheard a conversation between two of my huddled colleagues:\n\"I knew it was going to hit here. Igor is down there, he didn't want to stay.\"\n\"Come on, how did you know it was going to hit here? How was Igor supposed to know that?\"\n\"Well, obviously he knew. People just know, everybody knows. . . .\"\nHe's convinced himself: everybody knows. No one realizes that such \"knowing\" is pure nonsense. No one can ever know anything about this madness, because all its components are unknown. But we've been raised by our parents to look for a reason, always and everywhere, and for a black-and-white scheme of things. We've always known all the proper responses, and that made us feel strong, almost invincible. This makes the chaos that has overwhelmed us all the more painful, and for some of us, it proves fatal. No one knows how to respond to the real questions of today.\nNo one knows what is happening, or why, or who has a chance to survive and who doesn't. Where will the shell drop? Where are the safe places? Who will get in the way of a bullet? Who was born under a lucky star?\nIt is not surprising that everyone, without exception, searches for a logic, a meaning, a rule in the chaos that has become absolute and, it seems, infinite. Those who think they have found such a rule believe they \"know\" a lot of things: where to cross and at what moment, what roads are out of the question, what one can do without taking a risk, why the shells are falling here and not over there. These people are perfectly familiar with the rules of life that say who is more likely to win the lottery than be hit by a sniper's bullet. But the bullets whistle through Sarajevo every day, and only the newspapers tell us about the lottery winners, and their names aren't ours.\nIt's been a relentless morning. Shells are falling close by us, perhaps closer than ever before. The official alert remains in force; so does our private and personal alert. We evaluate our chances, run risks and keep hoping. We need to find our strength in private ways -- by learning not to lie to ourselves anymore, and not to look for logic where none exists. Because if we should find one, it would lead us to find a justification and a logic behind the actions of those who have destroyed all logic.\nBut I have to move now, because the noise has become unbearable. Once I've gone, you can be sure, I'll feel absolutely certain that a shell will soon hit the spot I've just left. But it won't hit where I'm going. I wouldn't be a true Sarajevan, full of sangfroid and flaming optimism, if I didn't believe that. Just as I know that soon this madness will all be over. From \"Sarajevo.\"A War That Makes No Sense\n In a half-hour conversation, Zlatko Dizdarevic, a Bosnian journalist full of stories of Sarajevo, tells only one story: \"I visited a prison and one guy, a sniper, 25 or so, said -- just like that! -- 'I am happy to kill a child when he is with his mother because there is something fantastic in the face of the mother!' \n\"What does 'sniper' mean? It means you decide to kill someone, to kill a doctor because he is a doctor. 'Sniper' means being ready to kill a child with his mother.\" \nMr. Dizdarevic, 44, tells many such stories in \"Sarajevo: A War Journal.\" But in an interview over coffee at a New York cafeteria, he is more philosophical, more political. And when, just a few times, he accuses Bosnian Serbs directly of killing Bosnian Muslims, his voice falls to a whisper, as if even here, half a block from Times Square, he is worried about snipers. \nStill, he says, \"It is not true that this is an ethnic war. The people of Sarajevo even today are working together. The question of nationality is just a topic for jokes among us. I am a Muslim; my wife is half Serb and half Croat. I don't know what to call our sons!\" He chuckles. His family -- the boys are 8 and 14 -- lives in Bergamo, Italy. \nWhy can't the carnage be stopped? He has written off United Nations forces: \"When you are looking every day at thousands of soldiers in funny white tanks, with very sophisticated arms, who are unable to do anything, this is very strange.\" \nWhen asked if he would want to see his sons put in uniform and sent, for example, to separate the Armenians and the Azerbaijanis in Nagorno-Karabakh, where a volatile civil war in Central Asia offers parallels to the Balkans, he shrugs off the question. Instead, he turns to the often-discussed suggestion of United States intervention. \"I don't think American soldiers have to come to Bosnia. The problem is not that there are no American soldiers in Bosnia, but that Milosevic\" -- Slobodan Milosevic, the President of Serbia -- \"knows that American soldiers are not ready to come. Just a five-minute showing, a few airplanes, would be enough to change his position.\" \nHe also blames France and a French fear of Germany: \"Without German influence, there would have been no independence for Slovenia and Croatia. So the French say, if the Germans support Slovenia and Croatia, we must find someone on our side. The French are historical friends with Serbia, and they don't care about the character of the regime. It's clear that Mitterrand is not ready to accept a Serbian defeat.\" \nAnd, he says, the racism that is directed at Arab and Turkish Muslim immigrants in Western Europe now taints the West's relations with Slavic Muslims. \"In Europe they are afraid of Muslims, but we are not that kind, we are not Arab Muslims. We are Slavs, we are Bosnians of the Orthodox, Catholic and Islamic religions. But you cannot explain that abroad. One guy in Paris, a couple of weeks ago, said to me, 'You cannot be a Muslim, you have blue eyes.' \"\nMr. Dizdarevic also talks of what he sees as the naive hope of Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic and some advisers that rich Arab nations will save Bosnia. \"They count on Muslim sentiment, but this is crazy. We have about 1,000 Arab volunteers in the Bosnian Army, but if such 'Muslim sentiment' is real, why are children starving in the Sudan, in Bangladesh?\" \nThis bleak catalogue leaves Mr. Dizdarevic pessimistic: \"There is only one solution, and that is human rights. If you want to be Muslim, Serb, Croat, that is your right. But it is not possible to say that your rights are more or less important than mine, and that is the spirit today. The problem is not one of nationalities but of democracy. The situation in Bosnia is the beginning of a new fascism, and we cannot solve this with 2 or 3 percent more or less land.\"BARTH HEALEY"}, {"text": "The Campus Crime Wave\n1993-03-07T05:00:00.000Z\nInternational House is a sturdy victorian mansion at the edge of the Brown University campus in Providence, R.I. On a late morning, just before the start of fall classes, Brown undergraduates in backpacks and Birkenstocks flow past its steps, heading for the cappuccino bars and bookstores of Thayer Street, the main campus shopping avenue. But inside the international center, incoming students from more than 80 nations, some just hours off the plane, are being given the drill on basic survival tactics, learning what alumni and parents are rarely told, what many students discover too late: no American campus in the 1990's is as idyllic as it looks.\n\"If threatened, do not -- how do you spell 'struggle' in English?\" mutters a doctoral candidate from South Korea. In the back row, an agitated hand. \"With 34 assaults near this campus last year, do you recommend that we equip ourselves with stun guns or Mace?\" (\"He's from Beirut,\" whispers a Danish student.)\nBrown's police chief, Dennis Boucher, his New England voice as crisp as his khaki uniform, replies: \"I've been attacked on the street in broad daylight, so it's impossible to be too careful. Lock your room when you go to shower. Call the shuttle or the escort service rather than walk alone after dark. Call me when you feel in danger, on campus or off. And memorize the university emergency number: 3322.\"\nWhen Wayne Lo, 18, roamed Simon's Rock College in Massachusetts last December, shooting four people and killing a professor and a fellow student, his armed violence was not unprecedented. In 1991 alone, five University of Iowa employees -- three professors, one staff member and an associate vice president -- were shot to death by a former physics graduate student irate at losing a research prize. At Temple Junior College in Texas, the chairman of the sociology department was held hostage by an armed student displeased by her sociology grade. At Yale, a sophomore died only yards from the university president's house, fatally shot in a street holdup.\nCampus murders or threat of murder invariably make it to page 1 of local and national newspapers, but they are still rare. Other crimes, however, usually less publicized, are not. An American college or university (enrollment ranges from under 100 students to 45,000 and more) averages three reported violent assaults a year, eight incidents of hate crime or hazing violence, 430 property crimes and countless alcohol violations. Like much off-campus crime, many more incidents go unreported. One in three students will be the victim of some kind of campus crime. Estimates on the number of women raped or sexually assaulted during their college years range from 1 in 7 to 1 in 25.\nFrom 13th-century riots at Oxford to today's armed clashes at college campuses in Bangladesh (where rival student organizations rely on rocket-propelled grenade launchers, rifles and submachine guns to get the most desirable dorm rooms), collegiate violence is not new. Yet only a generation ago, American campuses were tranquil enclaves in both image and fact. Most still feel like privileged and peaceful islands, the nearest thing in secular society to sacred ground, but since the early 1980's, image has less and less to do with reality.\nFrom ax attacks in libraries to shootings at dances, violence on urban, suburban and rural campuses has transformed many schools into discreetly armed camps: electronic passkeys for dormitories, cold-steel mesh on classroom windows, computer-controlled cameras in stairwells, alarm strips in toilet stalls. Messy realities, however, rarely surface in the glossy catalogues and upbeat recruiting brochures by which many schools now live or die. With an anemic recovery going on, the earning power of a bachelor's degree declining and the pool of 18-to-22-year-olds shrinking, many of the 3,600 or so institutions of higher education are promoting, as never before, the campus as intellectual resort -- Club Med with books.\n\"Campuses today are Athenian city-states,\" observes Vartan Gregorian, president of Brown, gazing with urbane weariness at the ceiling of his 18th-century office. \"Laundry, concerts, parking, catering -- some days I feel like Job: 'Hit me again!' But as Harvard's president said recently, 'Where else in America can you get hotel, health club, career advice and 1,800 courses for $90 a day?' \"\nKeeping the tuition-paying customers happy is far easier than keeping them safe, however. Administrators, faculty and students, when aware of campus crime at all, frequently attribute it to faceless hit-and-retreat raiders from the world beyond the ivy curtain: professional criminals, the homeless, local gangs. Dorothy G. Siegel, a vice president and associate professor of psychology at Towson State University in suburban Baltimore, is not so sure.\n\"Our only campus crime used to be plagiarism, but so much odd stuff appeared in the 80's -- rapes, robberies, even the kid who used his prosthetic arm to beat up a dormmate -- that I decided we needed to know: Is it us or is it society?\" She opens a thick printout: a 1989 survey of 1,100 colleges and universities by Towson State's Center for the Study and Prevention of Campus Violence.\n\"By guarding against strangers,\" Siegel says, \"we were locking in the aggressors already with us. Almost 80 percent of campus crime appears to be student-on-student.\"\nAlthough the number of crimes on campus is rising but not soaring, she emphasizes, the intensity of violence has radically increased. The Towson State study reveals a distinct subculture, common to campuses nationwide, of victims and victimizers. Student crime victims drink and use drugs significantly more often than nonvictims, have lower-than-average grades and tend disproportionately to be fraternity or sorority members. Perpetrators, who often commit multiple crimes, also usually have low grade-point averages, drink heavily and tend disproportionately to be athletes.\n\"Though over 90 percent of campus crime is alcohol-related,\" Siegel adds, \"chances of becoming a victim of crimes other than theft are remote if you avoid drugs and drink infrequently and sensibly. That's a big if.\" A Harvard study released last year of 1,669 college freshmen found a radical increase in students' drinking to get drunk since 1977. Many women now binge-drink as well. One college student in three today, in fact, drinks primarily to get drunk -- which is why so little campus crime is premeditated. Strong-arm robbery or auto theft becomes an impulsive event after a big bash.\nSiegel sighs. \"These aren't juvenile offenders, nor do they continue to behave badly as adults. But many just want career credentialing, not true learning, and the myth of college as a time of absolute freedom is extremely strong. Too often, the result is a four-year madness, morality suspended.\"\nAT ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY, IN THE tidy city of Tempe, serious weekend partying begins on Thursday, as it does at most American campuses. Asked at 1 in the morning, \"Why do you drink so much?\" undergraduates are succinct.\n\"Stress!\" says a blond business major in tennis shorts outside a cafe-bar on Mill Avenue, Tempe's main thoroughfare. Watched by a bored bouncer, he turns away to vomit deftly into a crimson bougainvillea bush.\n\"Stress,\" whispers an elementary-education major in purple spandex and gold ear cuffs as she clings to a palm tree by an apartment patio near campus. Two bull-necked boys (wearing T-shirts with the slogans \"Take Me Drunk, I'm Home,\" and \"From Zero to Horny in 2.5 Beers\") hoist the disoriented and giggling girl by the ankles over a nearby keg. She seizes its plastic hose and, hanging upside down, begins to gulp.\n\"Outrageous, awesome, major stress,\" a leisure-studies major says apologetically outside a Tempe club, aiming her too-drunk-to-walk roommate at the front seat of a silver BMW coupe. The roommate, long hair soaked with beer, promptly hangs out the car window, hiccuping and crying. Two girls in the back seat haul her in, whip moist towelettesfrom their purses and, crooning gently, wipe her face. But herhowls draw jeers from a nearby huddle of boys in Malcolm X caps. As they advance on the car, the girls roar away into the desert night, crossing four lanes of traffic in a $31,000 blur.\nDr. Ellen C. Yoshimura is the only substance-abuse counselor for 43,000 Arizona State students. \"This is a huge commuter school, where it's easy to be lonely and alienated,\" she explains. \"They join fraternities and sororities to make friends, or hang out in bars for 1-cent drink nights and wet T-shirt contests. I see a lot of crash-and-burn semesters. Some experiment with hallucinogens, including Ecstasy and LSD, or IV cocaine, or heroin. Yet the typical student I treat looks astonishingly clean-cut -- a hearty, sunny, polished, perfect child.\"\nUnder President Lattie Coor, the school is attempting, despite legislative budget cuts, to attract and keep a higher-powered faculty and upgrade its academic programs. Thousands attend Arizona State, the nation's sixth-largest university, then proceed respectably into adulthood. Many do not. They enroll for the resort-brochure weather (flawless, 80-degree days in November, for instance) and for the all-pro partying, which, as at many campuses, is often sponsored or encouraged by beer companies. Typical ads in student papers: \"Lake Tahoe All-Greek Blowout . . . Booze Cruise.\" \"Miller Genuine Draft Ski Utah! Round Trip Video Bus . . . Of Course All the Beer You Can Drink All Weekend Long!!\"\nArizona State has seen a rash of off-campus sexual assaults and other crimes by often-intoxicated student athletes (the football team's starting quarterback was found guilty of several burglaries), as well as an increase in the number of underage drinkers among its freshmen. The school and Tempe police are now stricter about enforcing the conduct code, especially the ban on under-21 drinking. Of course, under recent laws requiring that work places and schools be drug-free, any school tolerating illegal drinking risks forfeiture of Federal funds. But most schools fear they may antagonize parents by arresting their intoxicated offspring or, by enforcing drinking laws, alienate alumni in their 30's and 40's who still party at campus fraternities or clubs.\nOften forgotten in the current turmoil, though, are other tuition-paying individuals. Many students have no time to party: they work two jobs and carry full course loads, knowing their parents have remortgaged the house to finance a six-figure college bill. Degree candidates over the age of 25 -- the fastest-growing campus population -- worry more about day care than dating rituals. Students from abroad consider American attitudes on alcohol primitive. To undergraduates with Asian, black, Jewish or Hispanic backgrounds, in which serious drinking is rarely central to socializing, six tequilas with brandy or six vodkas with Triple Sec (a sweet orange liqueur) \"just to relax\" before a night on the town seem ridiculous, if not pathetic.\nSchools have neither a single solution to campus crime, especially drunken crime, nor a consistent policy of discipline for offenses to person and property. Though intoxicated students routinely smash toilets, yank out sinks, punch through ceilings, head-butt street lamps, uproot ornamental trees and body-slam vending machines, few are reprimanded or caught. Repairs become a hidden cost underwritten by the taxpayer, or squeezed from the library or faculty-salary budget. (There are exceptions. At Princeton, willful vandals must pay up and go on mandatory 5 A.M. cleaning-crew duty.)\nSome schools, especially those in small towns, have tried late-night alternatives to drinking: keeping weight rooms and coffeehouses open till 2 A.M., sponsoring midnight basketball leagues or late-night concerts. But even at schools in culture-rich cities, drinking and crime stay high. \"Remember,much campus violence is basically domestic violence,\" notes Dorothy Siegel of Towson State, \"fueled by alcohol and drugs, committed by people who know each other. And if anecdotal reports of college students bringing guns to school continue to rise, 90's America will have come to campus indeed.\"\nUNTIL RECENTLY, YOU COULD WALK ONTO the grounds of any college or university and be, legally speaking, on another planet. Employees have attempted computerized embezzlement of university funds and students have printed counterfeit money in their dorm rooms. But following seven centuries of jealously guarded tradition, instances of lawlessness have almost always been handled internally, with local police or F.B.I. involvement a last resort, even for felonies.\nRecent legislation, however, has sharply challenged such convenient informality. Three important new rulings insist that schools have a duty to protect students from, and to warn them of, crime and danger, both on campus property and in off-campus housing recommended by the school.\nFirst, in July 1992, the Campus Sexual Assault Victims' Bill of Rights, introduced by Representative Jim Ramstad, a Republican from Minnesota, became law. It stems from lawsuits like the landmark case in which four women -- current and former students -- charged Carleton College in Northfield, Minn., with negligence in allowing two male students accused of prior sexual assaults to remain on campus. (The case was settled out of court in 1991.) Under the Ramstad law, sexual-assault victims have the right to call on off-campus authorities to investigate campus sexual crimes. Universities also have to set up educational programs and notify students of available counseling.\nSecond, under a clarification of the Buckley Privacy Amendment, victims of campus violence can now have easier access to the previous criminal records of student perpetrators.\nThird, last fall marked the first reporting period of the first national law to require disclosure of crime rates on campuses. Sponsored by two Pennsylvania Republicans, Representative William Goodling and Senator Arlen Specter, the Student Right-to-Know and Campus Security Act has its origins in the 1986 death of a 19-year-old Lehigh University student who was raped, sodomized, tortured and murdered in her dorm room by a drunken fellow student. This act requires all colleges and universities receiving Federal funds to publish annually their security and crime-reporting policies, and to make public the number of on-campus incidences of murder, sexual assault, robbery,assault, burglary and motor-vehicle theft, as well as arrests for weapons possession and drug and alcohol offenses. (Larceny, arson, vandalism or disorderly conduct need not be reported.)\nThe Campus Security Act is a consumer-information law, treating higher education not as privilege but as product. But ease of public access to Security Act data varies. Columbia University and the University of Alaska mailed all requested information within hours. The University of Florida, four of whose students were murdered by unknown assailants in off-campus housing in 1990, dawdled two months, then sent nearly a pound of perky but largely unrelated brochures. The security office of the City University of New York said, testily, that they had never heard of the Campus Security Act. Adelphi University, on Long Island, went into a frenzy: \"Why do you want to know? We can't release that. Can you prove authorization from the legal department?\"\nAccording to The Chronicle of Higher Education, in the first annual crime statements submitted by more than 2,400 schools, there was a total of 30 murders, nearly 1,000 rapes, more than 1,800 robberies, 32,127 burglaries and 8,981 motor-vehicle thefts. The low figures furnished by many colleges especially on rapes make some security experts and victims' rights advocates openly skeptical. And since the Department of Education is not required to analyze campus-crime data, only collect it, a list of America's 10 Most Dangerous Campuses is not in the offing.\nTHESE DAYS, COLLEGES AND Universities have to struggle with a thorny question: to escape liability, how much must students, faculty and staff be protected? A major issue is foreseeable crime: a student raped or robbed, say, in a dark parking lot where previous assaults had occurred. Increasingly, colleges must invest in crime-proofing measures like shrubbery trimming, improved lighting and emergency phones campuswide.\nAll this resembles a revival of the in loco parentis doctrine -- the assumption that a university stands in for a student's parents, safeguarding life and morals. In loco parentis flourished between 1913 and 1945, as did its daily rituals, from grace before family-style meals to supervised socializing. (Should a girl sit on a boy's lap, some dorms and sororities insisted, she must first put down a magazine across his lap, the larger the better.) In loco parentis weakened after World War II with the arrival of older G.I. Bill students, and it vanished altogether in the 60's and 70's following demands that students be treated as adults. Lowering the voting age and in many states the drinking age to 18 in the early 70's cemented the national shift from student ward to student citizen.\nToday's students, trained as consumers from the cradle, frequently prefer service to empowerment. In spirit if not in statute, in loco parentis is back. The widespread attitude \"I get to do whatever I want but you have to protect me\" is forcing overwhelmed, underfinanced student-life staffs and campus security forces to improvise a new care-giving role: part concierge, part social worker, part bodyguard.\nAt Brown University's student union on a recent afternoon, a dozen women -- most young, one silver-haired, one heavily pregnant -- lie on a carpeted floor looking up at Lesley Pan, then director of special services for the campus police and safety department. Pan is a 1989 Brown graduate, slender and straightforward.\n\"Let's review an oral-sex scenario,\" she tells her self-defense class, a mix of undergraduates and research staff members from Brown's medical school. From a nearby sofa, the sole man present, a visiting literature major from the University of California at Santa Barbara, offers a dutiful nod.\n\"If you wake up in your apartment or dorm room and find a 240-pound assailant on your chest, or if what began as consensual activity turns to date rape,\" says Pan, her voice level and professorial, \"chomp down on his offending anatomy, brace your feet against the mattress, bring your locked hands up like a volleyball serve -- scraping the scrotum as hard as possible -- then heave him off with a strong fast hip thrust and come around with your leg cocked, ready to kick. Try it.\"\nFlailing feet fill the room, as the women grunt and lunge. The literature major is pressed back against the sofa cushions now, his eyes averted, face pale. \"Rats, I have physics lab,\" says a petite senior, sending a last invisible rapist reeling. Lesley Pan bounds to her feet, looking proudly at her panting pupils. Some are somber, some grinning. \"Next week,\" she tells them, \"knockout blows.\"\nAsked if women's self-defense classes could be made mandatory, Pan shakes her head. \"This is Brown. We don't do mandatory.\" Argument is an intramural sport at Brown. As on many campuses, the quest for perfect freedom, equality and safety involves a great deal of talk. (Should Brown security officers be permitted to carry weapons? Should female undergraduates write the names of male students believed to be sexually aggressive on the walls of public bathrooms? Impassioned committees deadlock for months, even years.) Meanwhile, Brown's net of student services grows increasingly fine-meshed: grief-therapy groups, support sessions for students with mentally ill families, an on-campus drug and alcohol rehabilitation program, a bouquet of 24-hour hot lines: dean on call, women on call, chaplains on call, psychologist on call.\nBY TRYING outreach and prevention programs, by offering safety education for women and men, schools like Brown and Arizona State are facing up to campus crime. But it's a constant uphill battle. Quite simply, college students are walking security risks.\nBored, healthy, smart and underworked (one recent study found that American undergraduates transact all school-related business in a mere 30 hours a week), their idea of a good time often involves breaking into steam tunnels or climbing onto steep roofs. The mechanically inclined play with elevators in high-rise residence halls, practicing \"surfing\" (riding on top of the cars), \"action\" (jumping from car to car) and \"helicopter\" (hanging from cables under the car).\nAcademic culture -- anarchic, self-centered, trusting, impractical -- is itself a contributing factor in campus crime. Forgetful faculty leave the keys in unlocked cars. Some alumni return to campus to steal computers or office equipment. Naive undergraduates keep homeless people in their dorm lounges, like pets; buy Girl Scout cookies from adorable tots with a sideline in wallet-lifting; offer mendicants rides to distant parts of town only to discover a knife against the ribs. At 18, you think you're immortal.\nEven before they begin their first day of college, say many experts on student life, a large number of undergraduates are messed-up, increasingly adept (often since high school) at reckless drinking and reckless sex, increasingly burdened by messy family histories, increasingly unprepared for college course work. Winning such hearts and minds, or at least opening them to current campus concerns -- from safe sex to racial harmony to homosexual rights -- is hard work.\nSome schools turn to theater: student-produced improvisations with titles like \"Sex on a Saturday Night\" and \"Coming Out 101,\" followed by audience discussion. Or they offer peer-to-peer counseling -- useful for a generation strikingly short on adult heroes or role models. Although such efforts lead some students to seek help or alter their behavior, many experts say that for the vast majority of collegians, knowing and doing are rarely the same. Only two forces can bring about change, some contend. One is a moral campus administration. (\"Possibly an oxymoron, like jumbo shrimp,\" murmurs one Big 10 professor.) The other, asserts a recent study of administrative responses to campus sexual assault, is an informed student conduct code.\nThis code, or contract between school and student, often fails those who need it most, says Andrea Parrot, an assistant professor of human service studies at Cornell University. \"Some schools, like Stockton State in New Jersey, or St. Norbert's in De Pere, Wis., make it very clear they won't tolerate people who rape. After enough suspensions, word gets around. Other campuses are ostriches. 'Our kids are nice, kind, moral,' they claim. 'We've never had trouble.' In between are mildly concerned schools -- look-the-other-way,don't-rock-the-boat schools, schools that whisper, 'There but for the grace of God go we.' \"\nMeanwhile, according to the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information in Maryland, college students continue to spend $5.5 billion on alcohol each year. Carl Wartenburg, for 20 years a college dean, now executive director of Alcohol Congress on Responsible Decisions, or Acord, a New Jersey-based effort to organize strategy conferences on student drinking, summarizes the views of many campus professionals.\n\"Raising the drinking age drove abuse behind closed doors and made social drinking impossible,\" he says. \"So often, in alcohol-linked campus crime, actions and consequences are separated: 'Oh, I didn't know what I was doing; I was drunk.' \"\nWhen Jonathan Greenberg, 34, a Manhattan financial writer, spent a fellowship year at Yale a decade after he went to college (at the State University of New York at Binghamton, from 1976-80), the change in student attitude toward drug use astonished him, as it does many of his peers.\n\"Their social drug of choice is alcohol,\" says Greenberg. \"My generation's was marijuana. The behavioral consequences of legal versus illegal drug couldn't be more striking. Stoned kids withdraw or ramble inanely about the meaning of life. Drunk kids turn hostile and abusive. It seems to me a depressing shift from the nonconformist dress codes and anarchistic leanings of the Question Authority generation to some 'fondle the babes, bash the queers' reversion to an unthinking, pre-60's, 'Father Knows Best' mentality.\"\nThe newfound paternalism notwithstanding, an unnerving disconnection distinguishes, and impoverishes, much of contemporary college life. Increasingly, faculty and administrators live far from campus. Some commute from other cities, even other states. Others hold down second jobs or teach at several schools. After sundown, certainly after 10 P.M., the campus, with its night world of wild drinking and unprotected sex, is almost entirely adultless. One price of such institutionalized inattention: at least 1 undergraduate in 12 suffers from a sexually transmitted disease; 1 in 10 becomes a chronic substance abuser. An increasing number -- how many, no one is sure -- are H.I.V.-positive.\nAT THE SIXTH NATIONAL Conference on Campus Violence, 200 deans, student-services managers, counselors and security officials converge on downtown Baltimore, crowding into presentations on ethnoviolence in cafeteria lines, nodding at a panel's findings regarding \"The Psychopathology of Machismo and Beer Dependency as Precursors to Campus Violence,\" trading data after a spirited session on \"Fatal Misogyny: Femicide on College Campuses.\"\nDuring coffee break, college officials browse among the new-product booths lining the hallways of the Baltimore Marriott. Many, looking thoughtful, tuck away brochures for dormitory-room doors guaranteed to resist both a sledgehammer and a .44 Magnum slug. Clients for such doors already include Harvard University and the Los Angeles Public Housing Authority.\nThroughout the first two days of the conference, delegates from the University of California at Berkeley are treated with nervous respect. In the campus-crime world, as in many aspects of American life, California functions as an early-warning system, a canary in the academic mine. From 1990 to 1992, 11 Berkeley students were killed or wounded, including three dead in a fraternity-house fire and one slain (six injured) when an Iranian immigrant and gun collector held 33 people hostage at a popular campus-area bar. Even the chancellor spent a morning last August barricaded in his bedroom, stalked by a female nonstudent carrying a machete and a hunting knife; an Oakland police officer shot her dead. Conference attendees are eager for wisdom from the Bay Area trenches. \"I want to ask them about student snipers,\" a security officer from Pennsylvania confides.\nBut on the third morning of the conference, the Berkeley chairs are empty. A Berkeley janitor discovered a body in the offices of the university's Filipino-American Student League. While working late, Grace Rualo Asuncion, 20, a junior, had been stabbed to death. No suspects, no clues. The Berkeley administrators caught the first plane west."}, {"text": "Before We Let World Bank Squander More\n1993-01-06T05:00:00.000Z\nTo the Editor:\nWhile we concur with \"The World's Poor Need Bill Clinton\" (editorial, Dec. 19), that the world's poorest countries need assistance, and that President-elect Clinton should lead the effort, we do not think that the World Bank's International Development Association is the best mechanism for providing this aid. In \"World Bank War on Pollution Faces Ever Sharper Criticism,\" (news article, Nov. 12), you note growing criticism of the World Bank's environmental and human rights record.\nBefore agreeing to provide $18 billion more to the bank's International Development Association, taxpayers in the United States and other donor countries should be aware that these problems are systemic and that without major reforms the money will continue to be wasted on environmental and social disasters.\nThree years ago when the World Bank asked donor countries for the last multibillion-dollar replenishment of these funds, it agreed with its donors to support environmentally sound projects, alleviate poverty, insure greater public access to information and to promote public participation. The bank's promises proved worthless; it continues to finance schemes that are documented financial, environmental and social failures, and to withhold most information on its activities.\nLast summer an internal review of the bank's $140 billion loan portfolio (led by Willi Wappenhans, World Bank vice president) showed that, according to the bank's own criteria, 37.5 percent of recently evaluated projects are failures, up from 15 percent in 1981.\nThe most alarming aspect is economic: according to the Wappenhans report, nearly four-fifths of the financial conditions in World Bank loans -- 78 percent -- are not complied with. The bank's economic appraisal is viewed by many staff, according to the same report, as a \"marketing device for securing loan approval,\" and confidential surveys of bank professionals show that \"only 17 percent of staff interviewed felt that analytical work done during project preparation was compatible with the achievement of project quality.\"\nWorld Bank water projects, such as the infamous Narmada dam in India cited in your Nov. 12 article, are among the worst offenders. According to the Wappenhans report, 42 percent of continuing water supply and agriculture projects are encountering serious implementation problems.\nBut the bank is preparing to finance still more of these losers on a gargantuan scale. Witness the number of dam and water projects in the pipeline: the Bangladesh flood action plan, the outer islands power project in Indonesia, the Lesotho Highlands water projects in South Africa and possibly the titanic Three Gorges Dam in China.\nThere is little concrete evidence in the bank's practice and priorities that critical habitats or the rights of poor and tribal people will be better protected in future projects. Most of these dam projects will create hundreds of thousands of new poor and homeless by forcibly displacing people from their lands. Millions of people have been left worse off economically after World Bank-financed projects than they were before.\nTo dump $18 billion more into the lap of such an institution, without total reform and housecleaning from top to bottom, is financial folly.\nThe world's poor do need Bill Clinton to promote their interests and those of United States taxpayers by refusing World Bank demands for more funds without serious structural reforms. Furthermore, we hope that the new Administration will appoint an environmentally and socially aware representative to the World Bank's board of executive directors, who will make institutional reform, project quality and financial accountability top priorities, rather than increased lending.
