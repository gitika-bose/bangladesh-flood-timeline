    "text": "Marooned by History in India and Bangladesh\n2015-07-03T13:16:17.000Z\nCOOCH BEHAR, India \u2014 It is June 6, a hot afternoon deep in Bengal\u2019s lush farmlands, and people seem to blur before my eyes. There\u2019s a humid haze, but the ground also is shifting beneath our feet. The fields around us are thick with ripening stalks of jute and paddy; the rice dangles in tassels of plump beads. Crops that were sown in Bangladesh will be harvested in India. The peasants who will harvest them are changing nationality even as we speak.\nI\u2019m in Falnapur #2, one of the 51 \u201cchhitmahals,\u201d or enclaves of Bangladeshi territory nestled in West Bengal in India. The word \u201cchhit\u201d means flecks or dots in Bengali, and, as in English, has connotations of dotty eccentricity. \u201cMahals\u201d means lands or estates, so \u201cthe dotty lands\u201d is a reasonable translation for \u201cchhitmahals,\u201d or \u201cchhits,\u201d the more common shorthand.\nSome 400 kilometers away, in Dhaka, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and his Bangladeshi counterpart, Sheikh Hasina, are signing a land agreement that will transfer to India sovereignty over Falnapur and another 50 Bangladeshi chhits and to Bangladesh sovereignty over 111 Indian chhits. The ceremony signals the beginning of the end of a remarkable territorial anomaly that has long scarred the maps of the subcontinent and the lives of tens of thousands of people.\nThe village elders I\u2019m huddled with, some Muslim, some Hindu, know something momentous is happening, but are unsure what it will mean for them. \u201cSince the Partition of India in 1947 we\u2019ve lived without any government \u2014 Pakistani, Bangladeshi or Indian,\u201d said Bijendranath Barman, the village head. \u201cIt\u2019s great that we\u2019ll get legal identity cards now, but what we really want is to keep our own soil.\u201d\nMore than 50,000 people have been marooned by the tides of history and bureaucracy in these landlocked archipelagoes. The chhits that belong to the Rangpur Division (Bangladesh) are enclosed by Indian territory, and the chhits of Cooch Behar (India) are enclosed by Bangladeshi territory. Some chhits are embedded in other chhits; those are called \u201ccounter-enclaves.\u201d One of them \u2014 Dahala Khagrabari # 1/51 \u2014 is a celebrated cartographic curiosity: the world\u2019s only counter-counter-enclave. A chhit within a chhit within a chhit.\nThe chhitmahals have never figured in the iconic shapes that school children in India learn to identify as their country. They are mythical territory, and even their origins are shrouded in legend. One popular story says these patches of land were traded as forfeits and gambling losses by generation after generation of the maharajas of Cooch Behar and the faujdars of Rangpur. The historical record is slightly less colorful, describing a convoluted series of land transactions that began in 1575, after the Mughals invaded part of Rangpur.\nThe chhits were scarcely a curiosity in colonial India, since the British humored hundreds of princely states within the Empire. They became an international conundrum with Independence and Partition: The problem could not be resolved at the time because Cooch Behar did not join India until later, and it was repeatedly deferred because it seemed insignificant compared with the complex politics of the new nations of South Asia. Stories within stories within stories.\nLife in the enclaves has been no fantasy island idyll \u2014 it is part statelessness, part incarceration, part exile. Deprived of IDs, access to any legal system, civic rights and state services, and always at risk of arrest under the Foreigners Act if they strayed too far into India, the residents of the Bangladeshi chhits had to be imaginative. Find an Indian who shares your name, pay someone in India willing to masquerade as your parent or bribe an official to get fraudulent papers of some sort: a voter\u2019s card, a bank account, a ration card for rice, sugar or kerosene.\nIn Delhi and in India\u2019s national media, the Dhaka summit is being cast as a foreign-policy masterstroke, and another benefit of the Modi factor. In fact, it builds on a 2011 agreement negotiated by the previous Congress-led administration that Mr. Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party, then in the opposition, blocked in Parliament in 2013.\nNow that the B.J.P. is in power, it has reversed its stance. Mr. Modi\u2019s motives may include a desire to complete the 3,400-kilometer barbed wire fence India is building around Bangladesh, a project held up by a clutch of border disputes that now have been settled, along with the chhit deal. During the election campaign last year, Mr. Modi denounced the influx of Bangladeshi Muslim migrants and the substantial trade in Indian cattle being smuggled to Bangladesh.\nThanks to its reputation as a hyper-nationalist party, the B.J.P. is better placed to ride out the very same patriotic objections it once raised against swapping the enclaves, namely the net loss of national soil \u2014 India is giving up some 10,000 acres more than it will gain \u2014 and the fact that the largest chhit in India will remain in Bangladeshi hands.\nBut in the district of Cooch Behar, the deal has provoked some anger, notably from Ananta Ray, the self-proclaimed maharaja of Cooch Behar who heads the Greater Cooch Behar People\u2019s Association and is calling for the creation of a new Cooch Behar province in India.\nMr. Ray is incensed that the Indian government has surrendered to Bangladesh the lands and citizens of this imagined state. \u201cThis government is no better than the Mughals,\u201d he told me.\nThe evening of the Dhaka summit, back in the world of electricity, piped water and cable TV in my hotel room in Cooch Behar town, I watched effervescent coverage of the accord. I was disconcerted to hear the anchor claim, \u201cWe are receiving pictures of celebrations in the enclaves.\u201d Over the previous two days I had spent touring enclaves, I had encountered only mixed feelings.\nLater that night in the hotel lobby I met Diptiman Sengupta, the chief coordinator of the Bharat Bangladesh Enclave Exchange Coordination Committee, an NGO. He dismissed fears that refugees from the now-former Indian enclaves in Bangladesh would come flooding in. \u201cOnly 149 families, 743 heads, will leave the chhits in Bangladesh for India,\u201d he said.\nThe farmers I met had little faith in statistics. \u201cThe last survey conducted here was in 1910,\u201d Mr. Barman told me. \u201cYou mean 2010?\u201d I asked. According to the swap deal, government officials had completed a joint head count of the chhitmahals in 2011. \u201cThey never came here,\u201d Mr. Barman said. Pulling a battered parchment from a plastic bag and unfolding it, he said, \u201cThis is the only proof of our existence.\u201d\n\u201cWe are sitting right here,\u201d he said, pointing at a smudge on the moth-eaten document. It was a land record map detailing every field in the chhit. Dated 1911.\nEverywhere I went people produced ancient yellowed documents from the early 20th century bearing various crests, seals and stamps. They were worried that their lands were now being swapped with little effort by Bangladesh or India to document their identities or property rights. With good reason. Even Mr. Sengupta acknowledged that most of India\u2019s records of the enclaves were destroyed when a storeroom in Cooch Behar burned down in 1974.\nSince land in the chhits was cheap and unprotected by law (sales could not be registered), over the years large tracts have fallen into the possession of outsiders. In Falnapur I found an Indian government servant who had established a small 10-acre tea garden. The former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Khaleda Zia is said to have owned more than 40 hectares in the Indian enclave of Debidoba.\nThe chhitmahals will linger on Google maps a bit longer: It is only at midnight on July 31 that India\u2019s and Bangladesh\u2019s enclaves formally \u201cshall stand transferred to the other.\u201d In the meantime, many of their residents await some formal documentation of their lands and their own existence from the overburdened and venal bureaucracies of their new nations.\nIn Bara Gharia, a border village not far from Falnapur, I met Biseswar Burman, technically an Indian but undocumented, and now a refugee from the Indian chhit of Banskata #115 in Bangladesh. A graying, middle-aged man who trained as a homeopathic physician, Mr. Burman believes there is no place for him in Bangladesh, and given that nation\u2019s sorry record of communal violence against Hindus, he may have a point.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t stick it out in the chhit for 67 years just to become Bangladeshi,\u201d he said, clutching papers from another country and another time. He was planning to join the Greater Cooch Behar People\u2019s Association. After all, he said, \u201caccording to my documents, I am still a subject of the maharaja of Cooch Behar.\u201d",

    "text": "Migrants Flooding Into Malaysia and Indonesia Trade One Nightmare for Another\n2015-05-25T15:15:57.000Z\nGELUGOR, Malaysia \u2014 The more than 3,000 migrants from Bangladesh and Myanmar who recently landed in Indonesia and Malaysia ended weeks of a nightmare at sea only to fall into an administrative limbo that could last years, even decades.\nIn a potential breakthrough in a crisis across Southeast Asia, Malaysia and Indonesia agreed last week to shelter the migrants, and thousands more who may still be at sea, on the condition that they be returned home or resettled in third countries within a year.\nIf the past is any guide, that goal may be hard to attain.\nFew countries seem willing to accept the migrants, even those who qualify as refugees deserving asylum; there is already a tremendous backlog of applicants seeking resettlement; and the agencies that deal with them are overwhelmed.\n\u201cEven if we get the U.N. refugee status, we still don\u2019t know how long we must wait before we can be resettled,\u201d said Hasinah Ezahar, 28, who survived illness, hunger and threats from the smugglers she paid for the three-week sea journey with three of her children from western Myanmar. \u201cUntil then, our lives are just waiting.\u201d\nHer family was part of a wave of migrants from Bangladesh and Myanmar who took to the seas seeking to escape poverty and, in the case of ethnic Rohingya like Ms. Hasinah, religious persecution.\nThere are at least 200,000 Rohingya migrants from Myanmar already in Bangladesh, and only 32,600 of them have been granted formal protection as refugees fleeing persecution, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Far fewer, perhaps only several hundred, have been resettled from refugee camps in Bangladesh over the past decade and allowed to begin new lives in other countries.\nIn Malaysia, those determined to be refugees and therefore eligible for resettlement, a process that could take years, would be joining more than 45,000 Rohingya who are already classified as refugees and are waiting to be taken in by another country. They receive no government aid while they wait, nor can they legally take jobs to support themselves.\nAbout 1,000 Rohingya refugees were resettled in the United States in the last year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a dirty little secret, but that population going to the U.S. is largely people in Malaysia who have been awaiting resettlement for 10 to 15 years,\u201d said Amy Smith, an executive director of Fortify Rights, a human rights group focusing on Southeast Asia.\nWhile the refugees wait, they cannot send their children to government-accredited schools and are suspended in a social and legal limbo that local charities and off-the-books jobs can only partly relieve.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating for us,\u201d said Anwar Ahmad, a Rohingya who has lived in Malaysia for 18 years and makes a living in the informal labor market. \u201cWe\u2019re grateful that we can stay here, and grateful for the help we receive, but without a stronger official status, I have no future here in Malaysia.\u201d\nEven the first step in that process, winning recognition as refugees through the United Nations refugee agency, has become forbiddingly slow, said Rohingya migrants, human rights advocates and lawyers.\n\u201cI think the U.N.H.C.R. is also a bit overwhelmed with the numbers, especially so many who have been here for many, many years have not been resettled yet,\u201d said Kamarulzaman Askandar, a professor at the University of Malaysia Sabah, who has studied the conditions of Rohingya in Malaysia. \u201cThe numbers keep increasing and increasing. Many of the newcomers, especially, are not being registered even after a few months of coming over here.\u201d\nMs. Smith, of Fortify Rights, said the refugee agency gave priority to those held in detention. About 1,000 recent arrivals are housed in the Belantik immigration detention depot in Kedah State in northern Malaysia. (The depot declined requests for a reporter from The New York Times to enter.)\nThose detainees, she said, might have their cases decided in seven to nine months. The others will wait even longer.\nAbout 25,000 migrants left Myanmar and Bangladesh on rickety smugglers\u2019 boats in the first three months of 2015, according to a United Nations estimate.\nThe classification process will not necessarily end well for most of the migrants. Migration experts say about half of the latest wave are economic migrants from Bangladesh who do not meet the requirements for refugee status.\nThey will be sent home as soon as possible, the Malaysian and Indonesian governments say, where their government may not welcome them with open arms.\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh on Sunday called the migrants \u201cmentally sick\u201d people who harmed the country\u2019s image, and she said they would be punished along with their traffickers, the official Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha news agency reported.\nThe Rohingya, a stateless Muslim people who have long faced discrimination and have been deprived of basic rights in Myanmar, are likely to meet the criteria for refugee status under international law, namely having \u201ca well-founded fear\u201d of persecution for reasons of race, religion or nationality in their home country.\nThey would be entitled to resettlement in third countries, and the United States said last week that it would take a leading role in any multicountry resettlement effort led by the United Nations refugee agency.\nSuch an effort, however, has yet to materialize.\nAccording to the agreement hammered out last week by the foreign ministers of Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, none of those countries agreed to host any refugees permanently.\nAustralia\u2019s prime minister, Tony Abbott, said Thursday that his country would not take any refugees from the current exodus.\nGambia said last week that it would take in all the Rohingya migrants, but experts questioned whether the West African state, whose own citizens have joined the deadly migration across the Mediterranean to Europe, had the capacity.\nEurope has its own migration crisis, as more than 1,700 migrants from Africa and the Middle East have died trying to enter Europe by sea in the first four months of this year, and more than 26,000 have landed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be really hard,\u201d said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch. \u201cYou have to have a number of governments say we will take quite a few Rohingya, but we haven\u2019t seen that in the past.\u201d\nDecades in limbo is not an uncommon fate for refugees. Somali refugees have endured in a camp in Kenya for more than 20 years, while generations of Palestinians have grown up in camps in the Middle East since the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.\nMany of the refugees here are likely to join Malaysia\u2019s swelling underclass of Rohingya refugees.\nThe United Nations refugee agency says 45,910 Rohingya were registered in Malaysia before the latest influx. Richard Towle, the agency\u2019s representative in Malaysia, estimates that there are an additional 30,000 or more Rohingya who are not registered, either because their applications have not been processed or because they have not tried to register.\nThe Rohingya refugees here say that Malaysia has treated them better than neighboring countries, but that their lives are circumscribed by the ban on work and schools, and by the difficulty in obtaining other permits for everyday needs.\n\u201cThe most difficult thing is because the government law says we cannot work,\u201d said Sahid Mohammed, a Rohingya man who fled his village in 2009 and made the trip to Malaysia by sea. He and other refugees said they made an uncertain living by working informally on building sites and in restaurants and shops, and by recycling scrap and hawking small goods.\n\u201cWe would like to work to make a contribution, and to send money to our families, but we cannot keep good jobs because the bosses look at our cards and say, \u2018You\u2019re not allowed to work for me,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cSome bosses use that to exploit Rohingya, because they know we are working without real status.\u201d\nMr. Towle said: \u201cGiven global priorities and the size of the problem here you are not going to be able to resettle your way out of a refugee problem of this size. It\u2019s not feasible. We think that if people are going to be here anyway we think it is good to regularize their status and give them the right to work.\u201d\nRohingya children in Malaysia attend privately run schools, often supported by volunteers, or they do not go to school at all.\n\u201cSome of the children work as well,\u201d said Dewi Karina Kamarulzaman, a graduate student who teaches at the Peace Learning Center, a makeshift school in a two-story home here on Penang Island with more than 50 Rohingya children.\nShe estimated that more than half of Rohingya children in Penang did not attend school, often for lack of transportation. \u201cThey can\u2019t even afford the bus fare,\u201d she said.\nMs. Hasinah, who is living with her husband and the three children in a single room in a shared house, has a more pressing concern: a 13-year-old son she left behind because she could not afford to pay the smugglers to take all four children.\nHer family\u2019s most urgent priority is finding the means and the money to bring him to Malaysia.\n\u201cWherever we go,\u201d she said, cradling her 2-year-old daughter, \u201cit must be with my son.\u201d",

    "text": "Rohingya Migrants From Myanmar, Shunned by Malaysia, Are Spotted Adrift in Andaman Sea\n2015-05-14T10:07:45.000Z\nIN THE ANDAMAN SEA OFF THAILAND \u2014 A wooden fishing boat carrying several hundred desperate migrants from Myanmar was spotted adrift in the Andaman Sea between Thailand and Malaysia on Thursday, part of an exodus in which thousands of people have taken to the sea in recent weeks with no country willing to take them in.\nCries of \u201cPlease help us! I have no water!\u201d rose from the boat as a vessel carrying journalists approached. \u201cPlease give me water!\u201d\nThe green and red fishing boat, packed with men, women and children squatting on the deck with only plastic tarps to protect them from the sun, had been turned away by the Malaysian authorities on Wednesday, passengers said.\nThey said that they had been on the boat for three months and that the boat\u2019s captain and crew abandoned them six days ago. Ten passengers died during the voyage, and their bodies were thrown overboard, the passengers said.\ntranscript\nNA\n\u201cI am very hungry,\u201d said a 15-year-old boy, Mohamed Siraj, who said he was from western Myanmar. \u201cQuickly help us please.\u201d\nIt was not clear how much help they would receive. The Thai military, alerted to their presence by The New York Times, provided some water and food on Thursday, then assisted the boat\u2019s departure farther out to sea early Friday, according to the governor of Satun Province, Dechrat Simsiri.\nThe boat\u2019s plight provided a dramatic example of the migration crisis confronting the region: An estimated 6,000 to 20,000 migrants are at sea, fleeing ethnic persecution in Myanmar and poverty in Bangladesh, while countries are pointing fingers at one another and declining to take responsibility themselves.\nMost of the migrants were thought to be headed to Malaysia, but after more than 1,500 came ashore in Malaysia and Indonesia in the last week, both countries declared their intention to turn away any more boats carrying migrants.\nThai officials have not articulated an official policy since the crisis began, beyond convening a regional conference to discuss the problem this month. Thailand is not known to have allowed any of the migrants to land there. The commander of the naval vessel that met the migrant boat here on Thursday, Lt. Cmdr. Veerapong Nakprasit, said it had \u201centered illegally.\u201d\nThe Indonesian Navy turned away a boat with thousands of passengers on Tuesday, urging it on to Malaysia, while the Malaysian authorities turned away two boats with a total of at least 800 passengers on Wednesday.\n\u201cWhat we have now is a game of maritime Ping-Pong,\u201d said Joe Lowry, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration in Bangkok. \u201cIt\u2019s maritime Ping-Pong with human life. What\u2019s the endgame? I don\u2019t want to be too overdramatic, but if these people aren\u2019t treated and brought to shore soon, we are going to have a boat full of corpses.\u201d\nThe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has asked regional governments to conduct search-and-rescue operations to no avail. \u201cIt\u2019s a potential humanitarian disaster,\u201d said Jeffrey Savage, a senior protection officer with the agency.\nMany of the migrants are believed to have been abandoned by their traffickers with little food or water.\nIndonesia\u2019s chief military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Fuad Basya, said Thursday that the military would \u201cpush back any boat that wants to enter Indonesian waters without permission, including those of boat people like the Rohingya.\u201d\nAfter Malaysian officials turned back a boat with about 500 people off Penang Island on Wednesday, Deputy Home Minister Wan Junaidi said, \u201cWhat do you expect us to do?\u201d\n\u201cWe have been very nice to the people who broke into our border,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cWe have treated them humanely, but they cannot be flooding our shores like this. We have to send the right message that they are not welcome here.\u201d\nAbout 25,000 migrants left Myanmar and Bangladesh on rickety smugglers\u2019 boats in the first three months of 2015, according to a United Nations estimate.\nMalaysian officials reached by The Times on Thursday declined to comment.\nTens of thousands of Rohingya, a stateless Muslim ethnic group, have fled Myanmar over the last several years, most going to Malaysia or Bangladesh. But the exodus over the last few weeks seemed to have caught everyone by surprise.\nThere is no single reason for the spike in departures from Myanmar and Bangladesh, said Chris Lewa, coordinator of the Arakan Project, a human rights group that tracks migration in the Andaman Sea. For the Rohingya, an accumulation of setbacks has taken a toll, she said, including the tightening of fishing permits, which has hit the Rohingya monetarily and nutritionally, and the government\u2019s insistence that its one million Rohingya residents are not citizens.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of things,\u201d Ms. Lewa said. \u201cTheir lives have become worse and worse.\u201d\nThe fact that so many are at sea at once, however, may be in part an unintended consequence of the Thai crackdown on human trafficking. After the discovery of a mass grave this month believed to contain the bodies of 33 Burmese and Bangladeshi migrants, officials raided several smuggling camps in southern Thailand and charged dozens of police officers and senior officials with being complicit in the trade.\nThe camps were way stations where migrants were often detained in prisonlike conditions until they or their families could pay smugglers for passage to Malaysia. As horrid as those camps were, without them, the migrants have been stuck at sea, their traffickers afraid to set foot in Thailand.\nMyanmar and its neighbors see the people of the Rohingya ethnic group and the seaborne trafficking of migrants in the region very differently, complicating the refugees\u2019 plight.\n\u201cTheir business model has been interrupted by the operations in Thailand,\u201d Mr. Lowry said. \u201cThey will be back eventually \u2014 smuggling in trafficking is very lucrative \u2014 but they are waiting for now.\u201d\nMigrants generally pay about $1,800 each for passage to Malaysia, along with the promise of a job when they arrive, Ms. Lewa said.\nBut they are frequently shaken down for more payments along the way, and many never make it to Malaysia, a Muslim country that until recently had tacitly allowed the backdoor migration of Muslims from Myanmar and Bangladesh.\nInterviews with passengers aboard a boat that washed ashore on the northern tip of Sumatra Island, Indonesia, on Sunday provided a glimpse of the brutal conditions they faced at sea and the desperation that drove them to make the risky voyage.\nPassengers told of waiting on the boat for months before it sailed because the smugglers wanted to pack it as full as possible with paying passengers.\nMost were forced to remain in the hold, squatting no more than an inch from the person in front of them. Every other day, they were fed bits of rice and noodles and small amounts of water. A hole in the floor, opening directly into the ocean, served as a toilet.\nThe passengers prayed or talked quietly, their whispers broken by the occasional sound of others vomiting from seasickness.\n\u201cThere was no singing, only crying,\u201d said Muhammed Kashim, a 44-year-old Bangladeshi.\nSeven days into the voyage, the ship\u2019s Thai captain abruptly stopped the vessel at sea, they said. The next day, gunmen arrived on a speedboat, boarded the ship and robbed migrants of their valuables.\nThe captain and crew fled with the gunmen, abandoning the ship.\nMahammed Hashim, 25, a Rohingya from the Kyauktaw District in Rakhine State, said the risks of traveling in a rickety wooden ship with little food or water were less than those of remaining in Myanmar.\n\u201cWe assumed that danger would come, but there was no other way,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were living in a country that is more dangerous than the sea.\u201d\nThey were lucky. A day later, the boat grounded in Indonesia, whose policy is not to turn back ships once they have made landfall.\nThe 584 passengers, including 59 children and 86 women, five of them pregnant, will have the opportunity to apply for refugee status with the United Nations refugee agency, a process that is expected to take months. For now, they are being housed at a government compound in Paya Bateung, in Aceh Province, where they sleep on concrete floors but have blankets, food and water.\nThe Rohingya, effectively stateless, have a reasonable chance at asylum. But the 208 Bangladeshis in the group will probably be considered economic migrants who, denied the right to work in Indonesia, will eventually choose to return home, Mr. Savage of the United Nations said.\nMahammed Jahangir Hussein, a 32-year-old Bangladeshi, said that was not an option. His father sold a house and farmland to raise the $3,250 he paid for the voyage and a promised job in Malaysia.\n\u201cIf the Indonesian government says we cannot work, all the men here are saying, \u2018Let\u2019s work in another country,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing back home for us.\u201d\nAsked about his future, he waved his arms toward the migrants gathered around him and up at the scruffy concrete building he had just moved into.\n\u201cThis is my future,\u201d he said.",

    "text": "ISIS Claims Responsibility for Attack in Bangladesh\n2015-10-24T11:23:04.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Three bombs exploded early Saturday morning during a giant procession here commemorating the Shiite Muslim holiday of Ashura, killing one person, wounding dozens more and unsettling a country that has little history of sectarian tension. \nFor weeks, Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, has been on edge over reports of unusual terrorist threats. After two foreigners were shot several weeks ago, some embassies warned their citizens against walking outside or attending large gatherings. \nSaturday\u2019s bombings were the first time Shiite Muslims had been targeted in Bangladesh, officials said. Before resuming the procession hours after the blasts, marchers stood mutely over flyspecked smears of blood where a boy had been fatally wounded. \nThe boy was identified as Sajjad Hossain Sanju, 16, said an officer at the Chawkbazar Police Station, Azizul Haque. Mr. Haque also said that 104 people were wounded by the explosions. \nThe procession, organizers said, has proceeded without any violence for 400 years. \nThrongs of Sunnis traditionally join their Shiite neighbors, members of a tiny minority in Bangladesh, as they weave through the narrow streets of Old Dhaka for the Ashura commemoration. \nMany were grappling with the idea that sectarian violence was possible here. \n\u201cEarlier, Pakistan was the country where the Shia were under attack,\u201d said Syed Ibrahim Khalil Razavi, who walked barefoot near the head of a march in central Dhaka. \nEfforts to stem the rise of the Islamic State.\n\u201cNow they target Shias in other countries, like Syria and Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cI suppose we cannot rule out the possibility that this could happen in Bangladesh.\u201d \nA social-media account believed to be operated by the Islamic State published a statement claiming responsibility for the bombing, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors radical Islamic messages and propaganda.\nThe statement said \u201csoldiers of the Caliphate in Bangladesh\u201d were able to detonate explosives in a temple of \u201cpolytheists in the city of Dhaka, during the holding of their polytheist rituals.\u201d \nIt was the third act of violence in Bangladesh that the Islamic State has claimed through social-media statements in the past month, after the murders of two foreigners, an Italian man and a Japanese man. \nFor several years, domestic militants have carried out occasional assassinations of writers or activists critical of strict interpretations of Islam. \nThen, late last month, several foreign governments reported that they had gathered intelligence suggesting that a terrorist group was planning an attack on foreigners in Bangladesh.\nA banned domestic radical Islamist group, the Ansarullah Bangla Team, on Monday threatened to attack media outlets if they continued to employ unveiled women as reporters or news anchors. \nShafqat Munir, a security analyst with the Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies, said the sectarian threat was new, and would have longstanding consequences.\n\u201cThey are trying to brand anyone other than Sunnis as heretics and deviants,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are trying to reorient the way Bangladeshis view Islam.\u201d\nThough the United States has built a counterterrorism partnership with Bangladesh, a rift has emerged over the past month after foreign governments, including the United States, warned of credible threats of a terrorist attack on foreigners by militants linked to the Islamic State. \nIn her public statements, Bangladesh\u2019s prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, has dismissed the notion that international jihadi groups can function in Bangladesh and blamed violence on her domestic opposition, namely the pro-Islamic Jamaat-e-Islami and the Bangladeshi National Party.\nOfficials from Ms. Hasina\u2019s party, the Awami League, were once again quick to dismiss the Islamic State claim on Saturday. \n\u201cThere is no existence of Islamic State in Bangladesh,\u201d Qamrul Islam, Bangladesh\u2019s food minister, said Saturday. He said he believed that opposition parties were behind the bombings, saying that \u201cthose who failed to make any movement against the government, they now have a new formula.\u201d \nHe dismissed the possibility that sectarian tension could rise.\n\u201cIn Pakistan, in Afghanistan, in other countries, but in Bangladesh, we do not have this clash,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Bangladesh, there is no clash.\u201d \nThe attack on Saturday occurred early in the morning, when 40,000 people had gathered at the starting point of the first procession, organizers said. \nSunni and Shiite Muslims were indistinguishable in the crowd, said Mir Zulfikar Ali, president of the Hossaini Welfare Association, which helped coordinate the event.\n\u201cThis is the old part of Dhaka,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Sunnis were born, the Shia were born, they grew up over decades and they developed brotherly relations.\u201d\nSecurity camera footage shows a densely packed crowd surge away from the first explosion, only to encounter a second in the direction they were running.\n\u201cPeople tried to go anywhere to save their lives, they were just running, it was complete panic,\u201d Mr. Ali said. \nIn the hours that followed, Mr. Ali was heartened to receive dozens of condolence calls from Sunni neighbors, he said. \n\u201cSomebody from outside is trying to destroy this brotherly relation,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not know who it is.\u201d ",

    "text": "Chinese Glacier\u2019s Retreat Signals Trouble for Asian Water Supply\n2015-12-09T01:49:30.000Z\nMENGKE GLACIER, China \u2014 Over the years, Qin Xiang and his fellow scientists at a high and lonely research station in the Qilian Mountains of northwest China have tracked the inexorable effects of rising temperatures on one of China\u2019s most important water sources.\n\u201cThe thing most sensitive to climate change is a glacier,\u201d said Dr. Qin, 42, as he slowly trod across an icy field of the Mengke Glacier, one of the country\u2019s largest. \u201cIn the 1970s, people thought glaciers were permanent. They didn\u2019t think that glaciers would recede. They thought this glacier would endure. But then the climate began changing, and temperatures climbed.\u201d\nBeneath Dr. Qin\u2019s feet, the cracking ice signaled the second-by-second shifting of the glacier.\nThe extreme effects predicted of global climate change are already happening in western China. Glacier retreat here and across the so-called Third Pole, the glaciers of the Himalayas and related mountain ranges, threatens Asia\u2019s water supply. Towns and villages along the arid Hexi Corridor, a passage on the historic Silk Road where camels still roam, have suffered floods and landslides caused by sudden summer rainstorms. Permafrost is disappearing from the Tibet-Qinghai Plateau, jeopardizing the existence of plants and animals, the livelihoods of its people and even the integrity of infrastructure like China\u2019s high-altitude railway to Lhasa, Tibet.\nThe fact that Chinese scientists are raising alarms about these changes is a key reason that the Chinese government has been engaging fully in climate change negotiations in recent years. Another is the deadly urban air pollution, caused mostly by industrial coal burning, that resulted in Beijing\u2019s first red alert over air quality on Monday.\nChina, which remains the world\u2019s largest emitter of greenhouse gas, pledged last year to begin lowering carbon dioxide emissions around 2030, and in Paris this month, President Xi Jinping reiterated his resolve to help slow climate change. There are no vocal climate change deniers among top Chinese officials.\nIn November, China released a detailed scientific report on climate change that predicted disastrous consequences for its 1.4 billion people. Those included rising sea levels along the urbanized coast, floods from storms across China and the erosion of glaciers. More than 80 percent of the permafrost on the Tibet-Qinghai Plateau could disappear by the next century, the report said. Temperatures in China are expected to rise by 1.3 to 5 degrees Celsius, or 2.3 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit, by the end of the century, and temperatures have risen faster in China in the last half-century than the global average.\nPeople across China are already feeling the impact. The most obvious devastation comes from flooding. The report said an increase in urban floods attributed to climate change has destroyed homes and infrastructure. From 2008 to 2010, 62 percent of Chinese cities had floods; 173 had three or more.\n\u201cChina is more prone to the adverse effects of climate change because China is vast, has diverse types of ecology and has relatively fragile natural conditions,\u201d Du Xiangwan, chairman of the National Expert Committee on Climate Change, wrote in the report\u2019s introduction.\nLast weekend, Chinese scientists released a separate report that said the surface area of glaciers on Mount Everest, which straddles the Tibet-Nepal border, have shrunk nearly 30 percent in the last 40 years.\nVanishing glaciers raise urgent concerns beyond Tibet and China.\nBy one estimate, the 46,000 glaciers of the Third Pole region help sustain 1.5 billion people in 10 countries \u2014 its waters flowing to places as distant as the tropical Mekong Delta of Vietnam, the hills of eastern Myanmar and the southern plains of Bangladesh. Scattered across nearly two million square miles, these glaciers are receding at an ever-quickening pace, producing a rise in levels of rivers and lakes in the short term and threatening Asia\u2019s water supply in the long run.\nA paper published this year by The Journal of Glaciology said the retreat of Asian glaciers was emblematic of a \u201chistorically unprecedented global glacier decline.\u201d\n\u201cI would say that climatologically, we are in unfamiliar territory, and the world\u2019s ice cover is responding dramatically,\u201d said Lonnie G. Thompson, a glaciologist at Ohio State University who helped found a project to study climate change on the Tibetan Plateau.\nAcross China, the surface area of glaciers has decreased more than 10 percent since the 1960s, according to the climate change report. The report linked the expected water scarcity to national security, noting that \u201cin the future, disputes between China and neighboring countries on regional environmental resources will keep growing.\u201d\nThe Qilian range, on the north end of the Tibetan Plateau, straddles three provinces and towers to 18,200 feet. Scientists here at the Mengke Glacier have been studying it from a permanent research station since 2007, one of about 10 major glacier research stations in China. The glacier is six miles long and covers nearly eight square miles.\nAs it recedes more rapidly, floods here have become more frequent and more powerful. In July, the road to the research station flooded, with water rising more than six feet.\nZhao Shangxue, who manages logistics here, said that he had had to abandon his car and walk four hours to the station.\n\u201cThe glacier has always melted in the summertime, but now it melts even more,\u201d he said.\nA report by the research center said the retreat of the Mengke Glacier and two others in the Qilian range accelerated gradually in the 1990s, then tripled their speed in the 2000s. In the last decade, the glaciers have been disappearing at a faster rate than at any time since 1960.\nFrom 2005 to 2014, the Mengke Glacier retreated an average of 54 feet a year, while from 1993 to 2005, it retreated 26 feet a year.\nAs scientists like Mr. Qin study the glacier and the consequences of its retreat, towns and villages in the region are grappling with a worsening cycle of drought, sudden rainstorms and floods.\nThe town closest to the glacier, Shibaocheng, has been devastated by recent storms. Its 1,250 residents, mostly ethnic Mongolian, graze yaks, horses and sheep in high pastures below the glacier during the summer. In 2012, a sudden rainstorm set off flooding that destroyed about 200 homes. Nearly 14,000 animals were killed or lost.\n\u201cOld people here say they hadn\u2019t seen such a flood in 50 or 60 years,\u201d said Gu Wei, the deputy mayor. She said rain mixed with hail came down for three days.\nScientists have no easy way to determine the exact relationship between the rainfall and the changes in the nearby glacier, Dr. Qin said. \u201cThe retreat of glaciers of course has an effect on the climate and on rain patterns, but we can\u2019t measure it,\u201d he said.\nSoutheast of Mengke Glacier, 180 miles away along the Hexi Corridor, Sunan County at the foot of the Qilian Mountains has experienced some of the region\u2019s worst flooding. It is home to ethnic Yugurs and has flooded a half-dozen times since 2006.\nFive years ago, at least 11 people died in floods and landslides. In July, heavy rains led to similar disasters in 13 villages, destroying more than 150 homes and causing more than $6 million of damage, an official report said.\n\u201cFloods in the Hexi Corridor are related to torrential rains and precipitation from fronts,\u201d said Wang Ninglian, a glaciologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. \u201cIt\u2019s caused by climate change.\u201d",

    "text": "2 Men Who Published Writings Critical of Extremism Are Stabbed in Bangladesh\n2015-10-31T16:56:10.000Z\nNEW DELHI \u2014 Two businessmen who had published the works of Avijit Roy, a Bangladeshi-American known for his critical writings on religious extremism, were stabbed on Saturday by groups of men in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, the police said. The attack came eight months after Mr. Roy was himself stabbed to death with machetes. \nOne of the publishers, Faisal Arefin Dipan, died of his wounds immediately, the police said. The other, Ahmed Rahim Tutul, was in critical condition late Saturday. \nMr. Tutul had received death threats on his cellphone over books that he had published, Mizanur Rahman, the director of publicity for the Academic and Creative Publishers Association, said in a telephone interview.\nThe attacks build on an already unsettling rise in extremist violence in Bangladesh this year. Mr. Roy\u2019s killing, in February, was followed by three more nearly identical assassinations of bloggers and intellectuals who have criticized fundamentalist Islam. In May, the leader of Al Qaeda\u2019s branch in the Indian subcontinent released a video claiming responsibility for the murder of Mr. Roy and one other writer, whom he described as \u201cblasphemers.\u201d Ajoy Roy, the father of Avijit, the murdered blogger, said he believed that Mr. Tutul was targeted because he had published his son\u2019s book.\nAs \u201chit lists\u201d of secular writers circulate on the Internet, many writers and journalists have become hesitant to publish work that could attract the attention of Islamists, and a growing list of activists, fearing for their lives, have applied for asylum in Western countries. \nAround 3 p.m. on Saturday, a group of men entered the Shuddhashar publishing house, saying they wanted to buy books, said Biplob Kumar Sarker, the deputy police commissioner in Dhaka. They then held two men at gunpoint while other assailants attacked the publisher, Mr. Tutul, and two men who were in his office, Mr. Sarker said. The assailants locked the doors from the outside when they left the premises, and the police said that after breaking the locks, they had found all three men on the floor with severe stab wounds.\nOne of the other victims was Sudip Kumar Barman, who blogs under the name Ranadipam Basu and has published commentaries on the website curated by Avijit Roy before his death.\nAbout the same time, three men entered the offices of Jagriti Publications, where they found Mr. Dipan, 43, alone and stabbed him, leaving him with fatal neck wounds, said a spokesman at the Shahbag police station. He was pronounced dead at Dhaka Medical College Hospital. \nMr. Dipan\u2019s business had published \u201cThe Virus of Faith,\u201d the book that made Mr. Roy a target for militant groups.\nMr. Dipan\u2019s father, Abul Quashem Fazlul Huq, said in an interview that after hearing about the attack on the first publisher, he became worried about his son and tried to reach him by phone. He went to his son\u2019s business and, once the authorities had broken the lock, walked into his office, and saw he was not in his chair. \n\u201cI saw that his neck was cut,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole floor was covered with thick blood. I could not stand there anymore. I left the place.\u201d\nFor decades, Bangladesh has struggled to contain a network of domestic militant cells, some of them linked to political opposition groups. They have regrouped this year, carrying out a series of killings, often in crowded spaces in broad daylight. \nOver the last month, the attacks and threats have proliferated. A month ago, Western intelligence services received information suggesting that the Islamic State terrorist group had plans to ramp up its activities in Bangladesh. Shortly thereafter, two foreigners were shot. \nOn Monday, the Ansarullah Bangla Team, a homegrown terrorist group, sent a letter to a Bangladeshi cable news station threatening attacks on news outlets if they continued to allow unveiled women to report the news. On Oct. 24, bombers targeted a huge procession of Shiite Muslims in Dhaka, killing a teenage boy. It was the first time in memory that the country\u2019s tiny Shiite minority had come under attack.",

Attacks on a military base are rare in Bangladesh.\nOne bomb exploded in a mosque on the ground floor of the base\u2019s hospital, and two went off in another mosque about 500 yards away, the police said.

    "text": "ISIS Says It Killed Italian Aid Worker in Bangladesh\n2015-09-29T10:03:09.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the shooting death of an Italian aid worker in this city\u2019s diplomatic quarter. If the claim is verified, the killing on Monday night will have been the Islamic State\u2019s first attack in Bangladesh, a country that has been grappling this year with a series of attacks on bloggers who have written critically of Islam.\nThe aid worker, Cesare Tavella, 50, was shot about 6:15 p.m. as he was jogging. The police said he appeared to have been ambushed by three men who had pulled to the side of the road on a motorcycle. The men fired at Mr. Tavella at least three times before fleeing on the bike. \n\u201cWe think it was a preplanned killing,\u201d said Mohammad Abdul Ahad, a police official in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital.\nAccording to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors radical Islamic websites, the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, issued a statement later Monday claiming that a \u201csecurity detachment\u201d had tracked Mr. Tavella through the streets of Dhaka and then killed him using \u201csilenced weapons.\u201d\nNo arrests had been made, and police officials cautioned that they could not immediately confirm that the Islamic State was behind the shooting. \n\u201cWe have seen news about this claim, but we will have to examine how authentic this claim is,\u201d Muntashirul Islam, deputy commissioner of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police, said.\nAccording to police officials, Mr. Tavella came to Bangladesh in May to work in Dhaka as a project manager for ICCO Cooperation, a nongovernmental organization based in the Netherlands that works to eradicate poverty throughout South Asia. Mr. Tavella directed a project called Profitable Opportunities for Food Security, which offers business training to small farmers. In a statement, ICCO Cooperation called him a hard-working professional \u201ccommitted to help the people of Bangladesh.\u201d\nOn Friday, Australia\u2019s Foreign Ministry announced that it had \u201creliable information to suggest that militants may be planning to target Australian interests in Bangladesh.\u201d This prompted Australia\u2019s cricket team to postpone a trip to the country. And on Monday, hours before Mr. Tavella\u2019s death, the British government advised its officials in Bangladesh \u201cto limit attendance at events where Westerners may gather.\u201d\nAfter the shooting, the United States Embassy in Dhaka ordered its employees to \u201cshelter in place\u201d for several hours and to otherwise avoid \u201clarge gatherings in Bangladesh.\u201d It urged precautions for American citizens in the nation. \nThe American International School in Dhaka was closed Tuesday, and security was tightened in the diplomatic quarter.\nFor the Bangladeshi authorities, Mr. Tavella\u2019s death raises the possibility that both the Islamic State and Al Qaeda are active in Bangladesh. In July, the security forces arrested the chief of Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent, which has said it killed Bangladeshi bloggers critical of religious extremism.",

    "text": "End of a Secular Bangladesh?\n2015-03-05T12:37:49.000Z\nCovered in blood, she stands over the body of her husband lying on a sidewalk on the Dhaka University campus. Onlookers, their faces stunned and fearful, circle the protagonists in what looks like a macabre scene from a Bengali jatra, or village opera.\nExcept this is not a play. The dead man is Avijit Roy, the Bangladeshi-American blogger known for his staunch atheism, and he has just been butchered with machetes. Islamist extremists are suspected in the attack. \nThis picture was relayed around the world after Mr. Roy and his wife, who were living in the Atlanta suburbs, were brutally attacked during a visit to Bangladesh as they were returning by cycle rickshaw from a book fair. \nThe spot where the attack took place is close to the university\u2019s teacher-student center, where young people typically crowd around the tea stalls debating politics, philosophy and current affairs. \nSome 25 years ago, I sat on those rickety wooden stools and discussed the same issues Mr. Roy wrote about in his blog, Mukto-mona (Free Mind) and his recent book, \u201cThe Virus of Faith.\u201d We students openly proclaimed our atheism. We probably provoked some strong reactions, but we did not fear for our lives. We were proud of the Bengali tradition of secularism, unique to the Indian Subcontinent. \nBangladesh has changed. The expansion of the garment industry and the rise of microfinance and community development banks put an end to the stereotype of Bangladesh as a \u201cbasket case.\u201d But economic empowerment also brought mass access to information. Today the disenfranchised and disgruntled can identify themselves with extremists anywhere in the world. What is their common identity? Religion. \nWhen India was divided in 1947, East Bengal became part of Muslim Pakistan purely on the basis of its religious majority. A year later, Urdu was imposed as the national language. The Bengali language has always been linked with secular Bengali nationalism. Protests followed, and on Feb. 21, 1952, the Pakistani police opened fire on students at Dhaka University. That day \u2014 perhaps the beginning of the conflicts that culminated in the 1971 war of independence \u2014 is remembered every year in Bangladesh and in the Indian state of West Bengal, and the monthlong book fair is one of the commemorative events. When I tried to visit the fair just a few days before Mr. Roy was killed, I couldn\u2019t make it through the crowds at the entrance to the university campus.\nI had gone back to Bangladesh with two of my children so they could experience the sounds and colors that I grew up with. The first sign that things had changed was at Heathrow, when an attendant at the Bangladeshi airline desk said that we would not be allowed to enter the country because of the Israeli stamps on our British passports. I explained that I had visited with the same passport before, and we entered Dhaka without any hiccups. My confidence in Bengali liberal-mindedness thus restored, the children and I got in a motorized rickshaw, headed for the port of Sadarghat. \nOn the way, my 13-year-old daughter observed, \u201cI thought it would be much more colorful. Are there no women in Dhaka?\u201d Looking around, I realized that most women were covered in black burqas or hijabs \u2014 a style that I had seen in such large numbers only in the Middle East. Many of their male companions wore long white dishdashas and skullcaps.\nI remembered that stretch as being one of the most colorful streets, with shop fronts spilling over with spices and trinkets, men and women loudly bargaining to get the best deal. Even in Dhaka\u2019s swanky areas, I was dismayed to find stores filled with hijabs and full-face coverings, with signs on the front windows reading \u201cFor True Muslim Women.\u201d\nWere the Muslim women of my childhood, who simply flung the ends of their saris over their heads, not \u201ctrue\u201d enough? \nMy father was Muslim, but before I became an atheist, I had embraced my ancestral Hinduism, visiting temples and lighting lamps for the festival of lights, Deepavali. I never feared being treated as an apostate. Now I do. Now if a passport control officer in Dhaka asked me what religion I belonged to, I would think twice before saying I was a former Hindu. Or worse: an atheist. \nThinking of Mr. Roy\u2019s book, \u201cThe Virus of Faith,\u201d I asked my Bengali friends: How did this virus find such a welcome platform? How did it spread so far that secularism has become a restricted word?\n\u201cUnfortunately, over the past decade or so, all the attacks on secular thinkers \u2014 who include people from all religious backgrounds \u2014 were committed by self-styled defenders of Islam,\u201d Jibanananda Jayanta, a Dhaka-based social activist, told me. \nThis prompted many secularists from Muslim backgrounds to distance themselves from Islam. They were in turn accused of blasphemy. The poet and author Taslima Nasrin went into exile in 1994 to flee death threats from Islamist radicals. But what were then threats or fatwas became in more recent years coldblooded killings on crowded streets. \nSome friends described the murder of Mr. Roy as \u201ccopycat violence,\u201d imitating similar attacks by fanatics elsewhere \u2014 part of the globalization of Islamism. In 2004, another writer, Humayun Azad, was severely injured during an attack that also occurred at the annual book fair. And in 2013, Ahmed Rajib Haider, an atheist blogger, was killed by machete-wielding Islamic radicals. \nIn both of those cases, the attackers demanded that the government pass a law against blasphemy, similar to the one that exists in Pakistan. Although the current government has strongly opposed such a law, it has nonetheless catered to Islamic political parties by harassing and arresting many secular bloggers. It has also used the existing law against hurting \u201creligious sentiment\u201d to punish dissenters. \nAfter Avijit Roy\u2019s murder, mourners placed a banner at the temporary memorial near the site of the attack. Its words could not be more true: \u201cIf Avijit is beaten, so is Bangladesh.\u201d \n  Lipika Pelham is the author of the memoir \u201cThe Unlikely Settler.\u201d ",

    "text": "Al Qaeda Claims Responsibility for Attacks on 2 Publishers in Bangladesh\n2015-11-01T06:53:38.000Z\nNEW DELHI \u2014 Statements attributed to a regional division of Al Qaeda late on Saturday claimed responsibility for attacks on two publishers in Bangladesh who put out works critical of fundamentalist Islam, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors radical Islamic propaganda.\nThe two men were stabbed, one fatally, eight months after a similar attack on Avijit Roy, a Bangladeshi-American known for his critical writings on religious extremism, the police said.

The assailants locked the doors from the outside when they left the premises, and the police said that after breaking the locks, they had found all three men on the floor with severe stab wounds.\nOne of the other victims was Sudip Kumar Barman, who blogs under the name Ranadipam Basu and has published commentaries on the website curated by Avijit Roy before his death.\nAbout the same time, three men entered the offices of Jagriti Publications, where they found Mr. Dipan, 43, alone and stabbed him, leaving him with fatal neck wounds, said a spokesman at the Shahbag police station. He was pronounced dead at Dhaka Medical College Hospital.\nMr. Dipan\u2019s business had published \u201cThe Virus of Faith,\u201d the book that made Mr. Roy a target for militant groups.\nMr. Dipan\u2019s father, Abul Quashem Fazlul Huq, said in an interview that after hearing about the attack on the first publisher, he became worried about his son and tried to reach him by phone. He went to his son\u2019s business and, once the authorities had broken the lock, walked into his office, and saw he was not in his chair.\n\u201cI saw that his neck was cut,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole floor was covered with thick blood. I could not stand there anymore. I left the place.\u201d\nFor decades, Bangladesh has struggled to contain a network of domestic militant cells, some of them linked to political opposition groups. They have regrouped this year, carrying out a series of killings, often in crowded spaces in broad daylight.\nOver the last month, the attacks and threats have proliferated. A month ago, Western intelligence services received information suggesting that the Islamic State terrorist group had plans to ramp up its activities in Bangladesh. Shortly thereafter, two foreigners were shot.\nOn Monday, the Ansarullah Bangla Team, a homegrown terrorist group, sent a letter to a Bangladeshi cable news station threatening attacks on news outlets if they continued to allow unveiled women to report the news. On Oct. 24, bombers targeted a huge procession of Shiite Muslims in Dhaka, killing a teenage boy. It was the first time in memory that the country\u2019s tiny Shiite minority had come under attack.",

    "text": "Bangladesh Killings Send Chilling Message to Secular Bloggers\n2015-03-30T13:42:26.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 When the steamy, clamorous evening had settled over this city, and Oyasiqur Rhaman had finished his day\u2019s work at a travel agency, he would turn to one of his favorite pastimes: Poking fun at fundamentalist Islam.\nMr. Rhaman, 27, blogged under the name Kutshit Hasher Chhana, or the Ugly Duckling, and he specialized in sharp-edged satire. In one post, he adopted the persona of a self-important believer fielding questions from an atheist. (An example: \u201cSee, the captive women, impressed at the heroism of the Muslim fighters, used to engage in sex with them willingly. Don\u2019t you see that it gave pleasures to them as well?\u201d) He posted photos of sausages wrapped in pastries, labeled \u201cpigs in a burqa.\u201d\nOn Monday morning, after he left home for the travel agency, Mr. Rhaman was killed for what he had posted. Three young men \u2014 among them students of madrasas here in the capital and in Chittagong \u2014 surrounded him and sliced at his head with machetes, cutting deep gouges into his forehead, face and throat. His body was left on the pavement in a pool of congealing blood.\nTwo men were captured by local residents and handed over to the police, according to Mohammad Salahuddin, who heads the district police station. Those men said an acquaintance known as Masum had instructed them to kill Mr. Rhaman because \u201che made some comments against Islam\u201d on social media, but that they had not read the comments themselves.\nThe killing closely followed the pattern of another five weeks earlier, when young men with machetes surrounded a secular blogger and author, Avijit Roy, as he left a book fair.\nMr. Rhaman took Mr. Roy\u2019s murder to heart, changing his Facebook profile image to read \u201cI am Avijit.\u201d Over the next few days, he also mourned the 2013 killing of another blogger, Ahmed Rajib Haider, known online as Thaba Baba, and vowed to keep fighting.\n\u201cThe pen will remain active, will continue till the death of your belief,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGet Islam destroyed, get Islam destroyed, get Islam destroyed.\u201d\nA writer using the name Biswaoy Balok, or Amazing Boy, responded in the comments section: \u201cSon of a dog, you will also be killed.\u201d\nThe deaths of Mr. Roy and Mr. Rhaman this month have sent a chilling message to the country\u2019s secular bloggers, who say they are competing for the hearts and minds of young people exposed to oceans of material promoting conservative Islam.\nMr. Haider, Mr. Roy and Mr. Rhaman were all swept up in the 2013 Shahbag movement, which called for the death penalty for Islamist political leaders who were implicated in atrocities committed during the 1971 war for independence from Pakistan. The movement was met with a passionate response from young Islamist activists, deepening a divide among members of the same generation over whether Bangladesh is, or should be, a Muslim state.\nOmi Rahman Pial, another prominent blogger from the same group, said he heard from five activists on Monday who said they were considering seeking asylum outside Bangladesh. Arif Jebtik, another activist, said that more \u201chave begun shutting their blogs down\u201d under pressure from their families.\nIt has always been risky for Bangladeshi intellectuals to criticize Islam, but when they fled the country, it used to be to avoid prosecution, not extremist violence, said Sara Hossain, a Bangladeshi supreme court lawyer.\n\u201cPeople who have lived in conflict zones will describe how you move from being a society where you attack people verbally and try to invoke the law against them,\u201d she said. \u201cNow our society is increasingly going toward one where you murder your enemies.\u201d\nMany people here had a mixed reaction to Mr. Roy\u2019s death, condemning the violence but also taking issue with his views.\n\u201cLook, 93.2 percent of Bangladeshis are Muslim, and 80 percent of those are against what he wrote,\u201d said Abdullah Fahim, 22, a business student at North South University, a private institution here. \u201cI don\u2019t know why our government gave him the liberty to write against Islam.\u201d\nMonirul Islam, a police official who is overseeing the investigation into Mr. Roy\u2019s death, said the police have seen a pattern of attacks on writers and intellectuals. Those involved are often well-off, Internet-savvy young people, he said, and not the impoverished men who typically committed such crimes in the past. Mr. Islam said the attackers operate in small groups and have been active so far in eight to 10 of the country\u2019s 64 districts.\n\u201cAt this stage, their strategy is silent, targeted killing,\u201d he said.\nThough the killing of Mr. Roy happened more than a month ago in a crowded street full of witnesses, the police have so far made only one arrest \u2014 Shafiur Rahman Farabi, who called for him to be murdered in a Facebook post.\nMr. Islam said Mr. Farabi \u201cdisclosed some information,\u201d and that the police have identified additional suspects, a group of men not directly connected with Mr. Farabi. He said he believed more than five people were involved, and that several of them probably attended North South University.\nThe authorities were luckier on Monday, when bystanders caught two men trying to flee the scene; a third man escaped. In an exchange with journalists, the two suspects seemed remorseless, according to Mohammad Jamil Khan, a reporter for The Dhaka Tribune.\n\u201cThey were talking with me very happily, that they have done a good job by killing the blogger,\u201d Mr. Khan told the BBC. \u201cThey don\u2019t feel any guilt. They think they have done a very good job for their religion.\u201d",

    "text": "The Imperiled Bloggers of Bangladesh\n2015-12-29T12:00:10.000Z\nUntil he was stabbed multiple times with a kitchen knife and forced to flee to Europe two years ago, Asif Mohiuddin was a leading member of Bangladesh\u2019s \u2018\u2018freethinker\u2019\u2019 movement and the country\u2019s best-known secular provocateur. We met last June at a cafe on a pedestrian promenade around the corner from his apartment, a sunlit space in a shabby-\u00adchic neighborhood in northern Germany. (He asked me not to name the city.) Mohiuddin, dressed that day in jeans and a green T-shirt that proclaimed \u2018\u2018American Atheists Convention, Memphis, April 2-5, 2015,\u2019\u2019 was still getting used to the tranquillity of his new surroundings. Shortly after he secured a fellowship at a German institute and left Bangladesh, extremists serially murdered four of his friends \u2014 all secular bloggers who had criticized fundamentalist Islam and whose names appeared on \u2018\u2018hit lists\u2019\u2019 assembled by hard-\u00adliners and disseminated on social media. \u2018\u2018Everybody is wondering who will be next,\u2019\u2019 Mohiuddin told me while picking halfheartedly at the kiwi slices on his plate.\nMohiuddin, who is 31, grew up in a Muslim family in Dhaka, Bangladesh\u2019s capital city of 14 million. The son of a middle-\u00adranking civil servant, he studied religion after school at a mosque. \u2018\u2018I learned many ridiculous things \u2014 that I would get virgins in heaven, or that I would suffer the ultimate punishment in hell for eternity,\u2019\u2019 he said. At 13, he declared himself an atheist. Muslims make up 89 percent of Bangladesh\u2019s population (Hindus, Buddhists and Christians constitute most of the rest), and belief in God is near universal; for a child to profess such lack of faith was unheard-\u00adof, and his father was deeply shamed. While in high school, Mohiuddin read \u2018\u2018A Brief History of Time,\u2019\u2019 by Stephen Hawking, which he calls \u2018\u2018a major influence.\u2019\u2019 At 16, he picked up a Bengali science magazine that used relativity theory and other scientific principles to explain miracles described in the Quran. He felt compelled to challenge the article in print. \u2018\u2018I wrote that it was scientifically impossible for the Prophet Muhammad to ascend to heaven on a horse,\u2019\u2019 he said. The science magazine barred him from its pages, but he began contributing to the religion section of Dhaka newspapers, sharing the space with believers. \u2018\u2018The Islamists would write during Ramadan that fasting is very good for health, that it creates new brain cells, and I would write back, \u2018This is [expletive],\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 he told me.\nIn 2008, after earning a degree in computer science, Mohiuddin turned to blogging. Writing in Bengali for a website called Somewhere in ... Blog, he drew upon the thinking of Bangladeshi philosophers and agnostics like Humayun Azad, whose most \u00adfamous work, \u2018\u2018Nari,\u2019\u2019 criticized the chauvinistic attitude of Islam toward women and was banned by the Bangladeshi government in 1995. (The ban was lifted five years later.) Mohiuddin\u2019s online writing grew even more strident. His posts \u2014 advocating women\u2019s rights and secular education, criticizing a law banning marriages between Hindus and Muslims, condemning communal violence targeting Hindus and questioning the infallibility of the prophet \u2014 attracted as many as one million views. They also enraged the country\u2019s \u00adIslamists, a relatively small but increasingly vocal part of the country\u2019s population of 168 million. Mohiuddin was sometimes challenged by the Islamists to debates in Dhaka, packed public forums during which he would only anger them further. \u2018\u2018They said, \u2018You should say the prayer to Muhammad before we start,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018And I said, \u2018Why should I?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Gradually, the invitations stopped, and the threats began.\nThreats of violence against freethinkers in Bangladesh were common, but at that point they had seldom been carried out. A rare exception was in February 2004, when Azad, then a professor at the University of Dhaka, was stabbed and critically wounded by radical Islamists near campus. He fled the country and died six months later of heart failure in his Munich apartment. Eight years on, when the radicals began to make threats against Mohiuddin, he brushed off the possibility that he would be killed.\nLate one night in January 2013, four men surprised Mohiuddin as he stepped out of a motorized rickshaw in front of the I.T. firm where he worked night shifts as an office manager. The assailants struck quickly. As Mohiuddin paid the driver, they approached from behind and hit him with an iron rod, then delivered a series of rapid cuts using a standard kitchen knife with an eight-\u00adinch blade. The attackers fled down the deserted street. At first, Mohiuddin didn\u2019t realize he had been knifed; a bystander told him that he was bleeding heavily from his neck and back. He began to feel dizzy and weak, and he staggered across the road to a small private hospital. A law in Bangladesh at the time made it difficult for doctors at private clinics to treat victims of violent crimes until the police arrived to investigate. (Months after the attack on Mohiuddin, the government changed the law.)\n\u2018\u2018They said, \u2018Sorry, it is a police case, and we cannot save you,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Mohiuddin recalled. \u2018\u2018And I was shouting at them \u2014 \u2018Why?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019\nMohiuddin flagged down a rickshaw and made it to a second hospital, where a physician probed the two inch-and-a-half-deep wounds in his neck with his finger; he determined that he had suffered no spinal-\u00adcord damage and advised him to seek treatment at Dhaka Medical College Hospital, the city\u2019s largest hospital, which was obligated by law to treat him. By now, Mohiuddin had managed to call two of his sisters and his brother-\u00adin-\u00adlaw, as well as several fellow bloggers, to tell them that he had been attacked. Together they drove to the college hospital, arriving two and a half hours after the stabbing. \u2018\u2018When I saw him on the gurney, covered with blood, I thought that he had no chance to survive,\u2019\u2019 Baki Billah, a fellow blogger, later told me. Mohiuddin had lost three pints of blood and was fading in and out of consciousness, but surgeons managed to stop the bleeding from his neck and upper back. \u2018\u2018They told me that the knife had missed my spinal cord by half a centimeter, and if it had touched my spinal cord, my body would have been paralyzed,\u2019\u2019 he said, pulling down his shirt to show me a grid of reddish scars covering his left upper back.\nMonths later, a group of Islamic hard-\u00adliners called Hefajat-\u00ade-\u00adIslam threatened to rally tens of thousands of its followers in Dhaka unless the government arrested Mohiuddin and three other secular bloggers. There is a seldom-\u00adused British-\u00adera law \u2014 Mohiuddin had never heard of it \u2014 that mandates a two-year prison term for insulting religion. A second law, enacted in 2006 and criticized often by Mohiuddin on his blog, makes \u2018\u2018publishing fake, obscene or defaming information in electronic form\u2019\u2019 punishable by a sentence of seven to 14 years. Bangladesh\u2019s secular government shut down Mohiuddin\u2019s blog and arrested him on April 3, about a month after his release from the hospital, on charges of violating both laws. (The hard-\u00adliners went ahead with their rally anyway three days later, drawing more than 100,000 people to Dhaka. A second anti-\u00adblogger rally a month later turned violent, leaving at least 27 people, including two policemen, dead.)\nStill recovering from his injuries, Mohiuddin now found himself locked inside Dhaka\u2019s vast Central Prison. One day, as he walked along the corridor outside his cell, he heard someone calling his name from the catwalk one flight above.\n\u2018\u2018I looked up and saw a young man on the balcony,\u2019\u2019 Mohiuddin recalled. \u2018\u2018He said, \u2018Asif, do you remember me?\u2019 I said, \u2018No, who are you?\u2019 He said, \u2018I was the one who knifed you.\u2019 \u2018O.K.,\u2019 I said, \u2018so come down, and we can talk.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019\nThe man came downstairs and told him that he had \u2018\u2018wanted to do something for jihad.\u2019\u2019 An imam from a Dhaka mosque recruited him and the three other attackers, he said. \u2018\u2018He was proud, and he was a little bit sorry, because I survived,\u2019\u2019 remembered Mohiuddin, glancing out the window of the cafe. \u2018\u2018I asked him, \u2018What will you do if you get out of the prison?\u2019 He said, \u2018I will try again.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019\nWhen I arrived in Bangladesh on a steamy morning in early November, the country had just been shaken by a new wave of violence. Two secular publishers were targeted, and one killed, in coordinated assaults. Like Mohiuddin, they were activists engaged in a mission that has few counterparts elsewhere: challenging Islamic fundamentalism online and in print in the hope that they can slow its spread. Militant Islamists have shown increasing savvy about using the Internet as a tool to recruit followers, threaten enemies and rally ideological soul mates to jihad. They have waged hate campaigns on social media against secular writers around the globe, including the Algerian journalist and novelist Kamel Daoud and VP Rajeena, a female Indian journalist who graphically recounted sexual abuse at a madrasa in Kerala state. The bloggers of Bangladesh have co-\u00adopted the militants\u2019 methods \u2014 facing them down on Facebook, Twitter and, above all, on the writing platforms that have proliferated in Bangladesh during the last decade \u2014 even as it has cost some of them their lives.\nThe online movement in Bangladesh started in chat forums in 2001 and then found a home on a website called Mukto-\u00adMona (\u2018\u2018Freethinker\u2019\u2019 in Bengali). The site\u2019s founder, Avijit Roy, a Bangladeshi-\u00adAmerican living in Atlanta, described the site as \u2018\u2018an Internet congregation of freethinkers, rationalists, skeptics, atheists and humanists of mainly Bengali and South Asian descent who are scattered across the globe.\u2019\u2019 Members of Mukto-\u00adMona shared their essays and those of writers they admired. Typical contributions, which often appeared in both Bengali and English, included \u2018\u2018Why I Remain an Atheist,\u2019\u2019 by Shabnam Nadiya, and \u2018\u2018Should Evolution Be Considered Part of Science?\u2019\u2019 by a writer who called himself T.H. Huxley Redux. The group endorsed the United Nations\u2019 Universal Declaration of Human Rights; opposed discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities, women and homosexuals; and vowed to take on \u2018\u2018everything that hinders people\u2019s access to civil liberty, freedom, democracy and secularism.\u2019\u2019\nAt the time, few people in Bangladesh had access to the Internet, and the impact of the site was limited. That changed three years later, when a Bangladeshi woman named Syeda Gulshan Ferdous Jana, along with her Norwegian husband and a computer programmer, introduced software that converted a standard keyboard into a Bengali phonetic keyboard. They also started Somewhere in \u2026 Blog, the first all-\u00adBengali-\u00adlanguage blogging platform. \u2018\u2018Freedom of expression is a basic human right, and blogging provides us with that,\u2019\u2019 Jana told an English-\u00adlanguage newspaper in Bangladesh as the site was gaining users. Around the same time, the government removed prohibitively expensive taxes on laptop computers, and prices dropped drastically. The open exchange of ideas on the Internet became accessible to a new generation of Bengalis. (Today, 15 million people in Bangladesh use the Internet, versus one million a decade ago; 175,000 of them contribute to the Somewhere in ... Blog.)\nMohiuddin began emailing Roy in 2007, exchanging ideas about the dangers posed by fundamentalist Islam. Mohiuddin believed that most of Mukto-\u00adMona\u2019s bloggers were too moderate, but considered Roy a \u2018\u2018strong voice\u2019\u2019 whose antipathy to religion resembled his own. Roy mocked religious visions \u2014 the \u2018\u2018Virgin Mary\u2019s face in clouds, Hindu symbol of \u2018Omm\u2019 on cows ... or the glorious name of \u2018Allah\u2019 on the waves of a tsunami\u2019\u2019 \u2014 as symptoms of an infectious disease. \u2018\u2018Religion has been used all throughout history to justify war, slavery, sexism, rape, racism, homophobia, polygamy, mutilation, intolerance and oppression of minorities,\u2019\u2019 he wrote. \u2018\u2018These atrocities are the products of virus-\u00adinfected minds.\u2019\u2019\nOther prominent bloggers echoed Roy\u2019s criticism. Writing on Mukto-\u00adMona, the satirist Oyasiqur Rhaman lashed out at what he saw as the ease with which Bangladeshi Muslims could be led into violence. \u2018\u2018They cannot differentiate between good and bad,\u2019\u2019 he wrote. He likened their behavior to \u2018\u2018the way babies get upset and break a lot of things,\u2019\u2019 adding, \u2018\u2018They would from time to time burn the \u00adhouses of the wrong kind of religious people and slaughter the atheists.\u2019\u2019\nThe bloggers and secularists were confronting a deeply entrenched Islamist movement, one that dates at least to the country\u2019s founding. Bangladesh was born after a war over religion. In 1947, British administrators created the mostly Muslim nation of Pakistan, dividing it into eastern and western halves with India in between. In December 1970, a moderate, secular party led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, a native of what was then Eastern Pakistan, won nationwide elections. But Pakistan\u2019s military rulers annulled the vote, and troops opened fire on demonstrators. Militias loyal to the regime, including those affiliated with an Islamist political party called Jamaat-\u00ade-\u00adIslami, began house-to-house killings of intellectuals, scholars, university students, Hindus and others. After a nine-month war, in which as many as three million people died, the East emerged victorious and declared itself the independent nation of Bangladesh.\nBut peace didn\u2019t last. In 1975, Rahman was assassinated during a military coup, and the country began a long slide into sectarianism and political and religious violence. Military-\u00adled or military-\u00adbacked governments with Islamist leanings encouraged the spread of madrasas across the country. Today, madrasas that focus entirely on religious education have expanded by some estimates from 4,100 schools in 1986 to 14,000 in 2015, educating more than one million students. These schools operate without government supervision, and many, according to a Bangladeshi former general and counterterrorism expert I met with, serve as breeding grounds for extremism.\nThe current government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, has pledged to uphold the demo\u00adcratic values that her father enshrined in the 1972 Constitution, but she has been forced to straddle an uncomfortable chasm between a professed embrace of secularism and an increasingly vocal fundamentalist movement. In a show of its commitment to secular principles, her government initiated a war-crimes tribunal for a dozen members of Jamaat-\u00ade-\u00adIslami who carried out atrocities in 1971. The group was driven underground but long remained a powerful force in Bangladeshi politics, calling for the creation of an Islamic state and the implementation of Shariah law.\nIn February 2013, a Jamaat leader put on trial was found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life in prison. The bloggers saw this punishment as insufficient. Hours after the verdict was read, protesters gathered at a traffic circle called the Shahbag roundabout to demand the death penalty for those indicted on war-\u00adcrimes charges. The crowds swelled to tens of thousands, many alerted by notices on social media. \u2018\u2018They were ordinary people, but the bloggers had started it all,\u2019\u2019 said Mohiuddin, who was among the leaders of what soon became known as the \u2018\u2018Shahbag movement.\u2019\u2019\nTen days after the Shahbag protests began, machete-\u00adwielding assailants murdered a young blogger, Ahmed Rajib Haider, on a street near his home in Dhaka. In February 2015, two years after Mohiuddin was attacked, Roy and his wife, Rafida Ahmed Bonya, returned to Bangladesh from Atlanta to promote his book, \u2018\u2018The Virus of Faith,\u2019\u2019 at an annual literary festival. \u2018\u2018I warned him repeatedly: \u2018Do not come back now. It isn\u2019t safe for you,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 his father, Ajoy Roy, told me in Dhaka. \u2018\u2018But he didn\u2019t listen.\u2019\u2019 Two weeks after his return to his homeland, as he and his wife were leaving the book fair in a rickshaw, two men set upon Roy with machetes. In front of dozens of horrified witnesses, they struck him three times on the head, penetrating his brain and killing him. His wife lost a thumb trying to protect him. The killers dropped their weapons and disappeared into the crowd.\n\u2018\u2018The police were standing nearby and watching the spectacle,\u2019\u2019 wrote a prominent blogger named Ananta Bijoy Dash, basing his commentary on eyewitness reports. \u2018\u2018Later, the police claimed that there had apparently been no dereliction of duty.\u2019\u2019\nThe attacks on Mohiuddin, Haider and Roy marked the start of a war against the blogging community. Weeks after Roy\u2019s killing, two men armed with meat cleavers struck down the satirical blogger Rhaman. In May, masked men murdered Dash. PEN International, a group that promotes free speech, had invited Dash to Stockholm, but the Swedish Embassy in Dhaka, suspecting that he intended to overstay his welcome, rejected his visa application. He was killed a few weeks later. \u2018\u2018It was a terrible bureaucratic mistake,\u2019\u2019 says Ola Larsmo, the chairman of PEN International\u2019s Swedish Center. Then, in August, attackers slashed the blogger Niladri Chaterjee, who went by Niloy Neel, to death with machetes after talking their way into his Dhaka apartment. \u2018\u2018His eyes were open,\u2019\u2019 his wife, Asha Mone, told me. \u2018\u2018I thought that he was alive. The whole floor was completely covered with blood.\u2019\u2019\nThe attacks that occurred just hours before my arrival in Bangladesh showed a growing level of sophistication. They appeared to be coordinated, targeting two of Roy\u2019s publishers simultaneously. One, Faisal Arefin Dipan, was killed in his office; the other, Ahmed Rahim Tutul, managed to survive. When I found Tutul, he was recovering at the Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, a cavernous structure dating to the British-\u00adcolonial era. Tutul lay on his side in checkered pajamas on a narrow bed in a private air-\u00adconditioned room. His long black hair, flecked with gray, was damp, and sweat dappled his face. Three red gashes ran down his right cheek, from earlobe to jaw, and two stretched across his face, ending at his beard and mustache. \u2018\u2018I can\u2019t hear well,\u2019\u2019 he said weakly, asking my translator to speak up. \u2018\u2018My ear is filled with blood.\u2019\u2019\nTutul described a hunt that had lasted for months. First, he received suspicious calls on his phone. Then, in late October, two well-\u00addressed young men showed up at his office, claiming to be shopping around a manuscript and peppering with him odd questions: How much rent did he pay? What hours did he work? Tutul filed a routine police report but didn\u2019t ask for protection \u2014 and the limited resources of Dhaka\u2019s police force meant he probably wouldn\u2019t have received it anyway. Instead, he began keeping odd hours at his office and taking different routes to work.\nThen, two days before we spoke, his assistant opened his office door in response to an innocent-\u00adsounding query from someone wanting to buy books. Wordlessly, a clean-\u00adshaven man in his 20s ran at Tutul with a sword and began hacking at his head. Two other men followed. Tutul survived after falling between a table and a chair, a niche that offered him some protection from the blows. Two friends who were in the room then fended off the two other attackers, and all three would-be killers escaped.\nI asked Tutul if he planned to return to work once he recovered, and he nodded. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s more than a business; it\u2019s ideology,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018I think that\u2019s how I can change the mind-set of people. I want to go back to it.\u2019\u2019 Tutul\u2019s wife, observing us from a corner of the room, told me that her husband needed to rest. As I left, a young police officer motioned for me to wait and sidled up to me in the hallway with a sheepish look on his face.\n\u2018\u2018Baksheesh?\u2019\u2019 he murmured, using the universal word on the Indian subcontinent and elsewhere for \u2018\u2018small gift\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018bribe.\u2019\u2019\nWhen I visited Monirul Islam, a joint commissioner of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police, in his cluttered office late one night, he complained that the government deprived him of the resources he needed to do his job. There was no separate investigative unit to deal with the blogger killings, so he was forced to handle them along with all the robberies and ordinary murders. Even so, maintained Islam, a slender, soft-\u00adspoken man, the department had made some progress.\nIn the spring of 2013, he and his men arrested a dozen young madrasa students involved in the attacks on Mohiuddin and Haider. All readily admitted their roles and laid out the inner workings of an extremist cell that was created with the specific intent of murdering secular bloggers. The killers were associated with a shadowy terrorist group called the Ansarullah Bangla Team that professed its admiration for Al Qaeda and published the translated pronouncements of Osama bin Laden on its website. Senior leaders of the group, Islam told me, included Jasimuddin Rahmani, a magnetic preacher at a mosque near the center of the capital. \u2018\u2018Rahmani sermonized against the atheists,\u2019\u2019 Islam said. A mosquegoer told me: \u2018\u2018There was a magic in his speech.\u2019\u2019\nRahmani had no knowledge about computers, but he employed two assistants at the mosque who scoured secular websites and identified potential targets. \u2018\u2018They would tell him, \u2018Look what these people are writing about,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Islam said. Rahmani set up safe houses in Dhaka where his students learned to kill. \u2018\u2018Rahmani showed them how to conceal a machete on their bodies,\u2019\u2019 the commissioner told me, and how to deliver \u2018\u2018two swift chops to the back of the neck, to sever the spinal cord.\u2019\u2019 Rahmani favored killing by \u00admachetes rather than by guns, Islam explained, because the weapons killed silently. \u2018\u2018They were taught that killing with swords is more virtuous,\u2019\u2019 Islam said, \u2018\u2018because that is how they killed infidels during the prophet\u2019s time.\u2019\u2019\nUnder interrogation, the killers detailed a painstaking methodology. Mohiuddin was the first target, but when they found him, they had only kitchen knives, and he survived. Haider was next on the list. Haider blogged on Mukto-\u00adMona and other websites under a pseudonym, Thaba Baba, and had never publicly revealed his true identity. The five-man team assigned to kill him pored over photos of Shahbag members on Facebook, identifying him through a process of elimination. Then they followed him home from a rally and studied his movements over a period of days. On the day of a protest strike called by Shahbag, the killers played cricket in the street in front of Haider\u2019s home, waiting until he ventured out alone at night. When he finally did, Islam said, they \u2018\u2018slaughtered him in the road.\u2019\u2019\nThe police eventually arrested a total of 15 suspects in the murders of Roy, Rhaman and Neel. But even when an arrest is made, securing convictions is difficult. The judiciary system is filled with Islamist sympathizers and is widely regarded as corrupt. \u2018\u2018We are frustrated,\u2019\u2019 Islam told me. One of Mohiuddin\u2019s would-be killers, I was told, was the nephew of a deputy government minister. Released from prison on bail, he turned up again as a chief suspect in another killing. Even government officials told me they were powerless to stop the violence. In his Dhaka office, the Bangladeshi information minister, Hasan Haq Inu, said: \u2018\u2018This might continue for a certain time, and anyone can be hit. Everybody is in danger.\u2019\u2019\nWith law enforcement crippled and the government unwilling to push back on fundamentalists too hard, the bloggers have been left to protect one another. Days after I arrived in Dhaka, I found myself in a three-room apartment, where 20 young men and a handful of women sat around a large table covered with parathas and steamed sweetened rice-flour cakes known as pitha. This was the unmarked headquarters of the Shahbag movement.\nA cloud of cigarette smoke hung over the scene. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re so tense these days that everybody has started smoking again,\u2019\u2019 said Arif Jebtik, a strong-\u00adshouldered man in his 30s who was a regular guest on TV talk shows until the killings required him to lower his profile. Jebtik told me that he now occupied first place on a new hit list. \u2018\u2018I replaced Niloy Neel,\u2019\u2019 he said. Since Neel\u2019s murder, the bloggers have worked together to hide those who feel that their lives are in danger. \u2018\u2018We tell them, Lay low, and don\u2019t use the Internet,\u2019\u2019 Jebtik said.\nStill, most of the bloggers had no intention of abandoning the fight. \u2018\u2018The Islamists are growing stronger,\u2019\u2019 Maruf Rosul told me. \u2018\u2018They are trying to establish Shariah law and convert Bangladesh into a religious country. If you present an obstacle, you can be killed. But it\u2019s a risk we have to take.\u2019\u2019\nMost bloggers I spoke with believed that they were up against a hidden hand \u2014 probably Jamaat-\u00ade-\u00adIslami, the fundamentalist party. The government banned Jamaat in 2013 from participating in elections, and most of its members had gone underground. Several of those facing execution for their role in the 1971 massacres had been top officials in Jamaat, and it was widely assumed that the party was targeting the bloggers in revenge for organizing the demonstrations supporting the death penalty. \u2018\u2018We have a tradition of secularism in this country, and we have to fight for it,\u2019\u2019 Obinu Kabira said. \u2018\u2018We have to fight for Hindus and Muslims living together, and fight for tolerance.\u2019\u2019 Making their task more difficult, he said, was their sense that Sheikh Hasina\u2019s government was not behind them. \u2018\u2018The governments of this country have always compromised with the extremists,\u2019\u2019 Kabira said. \u2018\u2018This government has attacked Shahbag, saying that we are dividing the nation.\u2019\u2019\nThe bloggers suspected that Jamaat-\u00ade-\u00adIslami was now working through another fundamentalist movement that had not yet been broken up by the government: Hefajat-\u00ade-\u00adIslam, the group that called for the arrests of Asif Mohiuddin and other bloggers. In the spring, Hefajat had circulated a list of 13 demands, calling for banning women from the workplace and enforcing a total separation of the sexes in public life. \u2018\u2018The extremists are going to declare this a religious country, so we have to protect the values of our Liberation War,\u2019\u2019 said Imran Sarker, the spokesman of Shahbag, evoking the 1971 struggle that many Bangladeshis regard as a fight to the death to build a democratic society.\nThe Shahbag leadership had tried to reach out to the hard-\u00adliners, in a show of dedication to the open exchange of ideas. During a television appearance in the summer of 2013, Jebtik proposed a public debate with the nonagenarian leader of Hefajat-\u00ade-\u00adIslam. \u2018\u2018We told him: \u2018We are not against religion. We just want to make a good Bangladesh.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Jebtik told me as I got ready to leave the apartment. \u2018\u2018He said: \u2018We have nothing to say to you. We just want that you should be hanged.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019\nLater, Jebtik and other Shahbag leaders organized a road trip to Chittagong, a humid port city 150 miles southeast of Dhaka that serves as Hefajat-\u00ade-\u00adIslam\u2019s headquarters. But before leaving, Shahbag members said they had received threats from Hefajat leaders, including Secretary General Junaid Babunagari, and they ultimately had to abandon the trip when the police refused to let them into Chittagong. Had they made it, an organizer told me, Babunagari said he\u2019d be waiting and promised to cut one of them \u2018\u2018with a sword into a hundred pieces.\u2019\u2019\nA green gate, barely noticeable along a rickshaw-\u00adchoked street, marks the entrance to the Hathazari Madrasa, the country\u2019s oldest Quranic school, which is now run by the top leaders of Hefajat-\u00ade-\u00adIslam. Visitors are rarely invited inside, but after the most recent wave of violence, the madrasa officials agreed to my request for an interview. Babunagari himself greeted me as I emerged from the taxi and beckoned me past surprised students. I walked across a scruffy, palm-\u00adfringed lawn, through an enormous complex of mosques, classroom buildings and five-story dormitories that house 5,500 students. (An additional 3,500 are day students.)\nA heavyset figure with gold-\u00adframe glasses and a white shalwar kameez that strained over his ample belly, Babunagari is a highly divisive figure in Bangladesh. The local news media reported that under interrogation, he had confessed to plotting to overthrow the government by creating chaos in the streets of Dhaka in 2013 and installing an Islamic government. \u2018\u2018The media distorted what I said \u2014 our aim is not to grab state power,\u2019\u2019 he told me, surrounded by several other Hefajat leaders. \u2018\u2018We came without any arms, to protest peacefully, because people were using abusive words about the prophet.\u2019\u2019\nSitting with me in the conference room, leaning back in his chair and resting his hands on his belly, Babunagari denied accusations that his movement had compiled a hit list of bloggers and activists. \u2018\u2018We are peace-\u00adloving people,\u2019\u2019 he said as dozens of students peered at us through the open door, watching the encounter with fascination. \u2018\u2018We are against taking the law into our own hands.\u2019\u2019 It was up to the government, he said, to \u2018\u2018deal with the blasphemers,\u2019\u2019 by arresting them, trying them and sentencing them to a \u2018\u2018just\u2019\u2019 punishment. Babunagari suggested that \u2018\u201814 years in prison\u2019\u2019 would be appropriate, though a Hefajat-\u00ade-\u00adIslam spokesman I met in Dhaka had told me that they should all be put to death.\nBabunagari insisted that the bloggers had mischaracterized his movement as intolerant fanatics intent on establishing a theocratic state in Bangladesh. \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t have any plan to turn Bangladesh into a Saudi Arabian society,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018When we consider the reality of Bangladesh right now, this is not a favorable environment to do so. We have Hindus, Christians \u2014 we want to ensure a peaceful society for them as well.\u2019\u2019\nHe went on: \u2018\u2018Islam teaches to love peace and discipline for all the people, from all religions. So according to Islam, we have been working for people from all religions. There is a Hadith about this: \u2018If any Muslim kills an innocent non-\u00adMuslim for any reason, that Muslim will not be able to obtain even the smell of heaven.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019\nI asked Babunagari if he had threatened to cut the Shahbag leaders to pieces with a sword if they showed up in Chittagong. \u2018\u2018I never uttered this statement,\u2019\u2019 he said, shaking his head vigorously.\n\u2018\u2018Is it possible that you let something slip out in anger?\u2019\u2019\n\u2018\u2018The Quran teaches us that a Muslim cannot utter a word that may hurt someone else,\u2019\u2019 he replied. \u2018\u2018Islam teaches us to control our tongues, even in anger. You cannot say it is a slip of the tongue.\u2019\u2019\nThere was ample reason to believe that Hefajat was not as peaceful as Babunagari was letting on. In 2012, hundreds of young men, many believed to be Hathazari students, vandalized several Hindu temples and burned the homes of more than 50 Hindu families in Chittagong. Last year, the police raided another affiliated madrasa, which led them to stockpiles of weapons and explosives. But evidence of misdeeds as elusive and untraceable as inciting violence against bloggers is difficult to come by. Even a well-\u00adfunded, fully uncompromised police force would have difficulty. The ideas that drive these attacks could come from anywhere\u00ad \u2014 from individual imams or a school as large as this one.\nAfter lunch, Babunagari took me on a tour of the madrasa. We walked down corridors, past enormous lecture halls. In the Faculty of Hadith, an instructor chanted verses from the Quran Sharif, a revered collection of sayings of the prophet, to 2,500 students, who sat in rows on the floor and followed along in large, leather-\u00adbound volumes. In the Department of Islamic Law and Research Center, I asked a 27-year-old postgraduate fellow how those who mocked Islam should be punished.\nHe shifted nervously. One of Babunagari\u2019s colleagues whispered something into the fellow\u2019s ear. \u2018\u2018There is a solution for that,\u2019\u2019 the student said, but he declined to elaborate.",

    "text": "Dhaka\u2019s Much-Loved Monstrosity\n2015-09-30T09:45:35.000Z\nFrom across the lake, we watched them dig the foundations. We thought, at the time, that it would look like any other house, albeit with a bit more lake frontage than most. Then, as the scaffolding went up, and the building took shape, we realized it wasn\u2019t going to be an ordinary house at all, but that rare thing: a landmark \u2014 and an architectural monstrosity.\nIt was 1993 and my parents and I had recently returned to Dhaka, Bangladesh, after 14 years abroad, most recently in Bangkok. With the promise of a new life in our old hometown, we moved into my grandfather\u2019s house, where two of my uncles lived with their wives and children. The house, built in 1964, was a sprawling, two-story brick building, with a flat cement roof and a wide wraparound balcony. The kitchen was in an outbuilding, down a few steps and across an open drain into which one uncle would blow his nose every morning.\nIn the backyard, which was wild and unmown, my cousins and I pretended to shoot things with imaginary guns. In the evenings, the air was thick with mosquitoes.\nDhaka was then still a rather sleepy metropolis. You could get across town, between Dhanmondi, where we lived, to Gulshan, the diplomatic enclave on the northern fringe, in about 20 minutes. After Bangkok, where the traffic and pollution were much worse, Dhaka seemed bucolic, even neat, by comparison.\nBut in the early \u201990s, everything began to change. The house across the lake was a sign of things to come.\nIt was about six stories high and irregularly shaped. Multiple roofs cascaded from its peaks, making the front of the building resemble the hide of a rhinoceros, from which a tall, pointy obelisk was raised. It was only after the red tiles had been placed on the facade that we realized the pointy thing was a minaret.\nThe building was a strange pastiche of the sacred and the secular, for the rest of it looked like a ship, with the outer boundary wall shaped like a curved hull and the roofs looking like sails in the wind. The neighbors nicknamed it Jahaj Bari (the Ship House).\nUrban myths about it sprouted. We heard that it belonged to Sher-e-Khwaja, a self-styled holy man and philanthropist who had amassed a huge fortune no one knew quite how, and who was rumored to have deep political connections. No one I knew had ever been inside the building, which was said to have 40 bedrooms.\nIn the meantime, the landscape of Dhaka was rapidly changing. The roughly 100 square miles of the city were not enough for a growing metropolis, but instead of expanding out and creating suburbs, the city planners gave permission to landowners in 1996 to build six-story apartment buildings on their residential plots. Commercial permits soon followed, and those who were lucky enough to own a piece of land on a main road were able to build shopping malls and office buildings on their property.\nThis is what happened with my grandfather\u2019s house. In 1999, the family made the decision to tear down the broad, low-slung building; in its place a shopping mall and an apartment building sprang up. My father and his four brothers each got two apartments. Uncles, aunts, cousins, their wives and children all moved into this building, an extended family bifurcated now by stairwells and separate entrances.\nOur neighbors did the same, and soon the familiar whine of construction and the sight of cement mixers and bricks spilling out onto the road became ordinary. Throughout the construction of our building, and those around us, the Jahaj Bari remained as it was \u2014 impenetrable, mysterious, lights twinkling from crimson towers above the dark lake.\nThe price of property in Dhaka has escalated: Over the last decade, the value of homes in our neighborhood multiplied by a factor of five or six. As land has become scarcer, almost every available inch of the city has been turned into apartments, offices and high-rises.\nIn the upscale neighborhoods like Gulshan, you will occasionally see a fancy house that has remained untouched. But it is often now in shade, flanked by taller buildings. The planning authorities did not insist that landowners leave a certain amount of space between buildings, which also means that the buildings are perilously close to one another \u2014 a dangerous mistake given that Dhaka is susceptible to earthquakes like the one that struck Nepal earlier this year.\nEverywhere is evidence of the haphazard nature of the city\u2019s growth. Even as property values increased, the overburdened roads, sanitation and drainage systems all deteriorated. Traffic is almost perpetually gridlocked, and during every monsoon season the roads flood and become impassable. Worst of all is the urban misery of the slum-dwellers who migrate to the city every year in their tens of thousands.\nThe city planning authority, known as Rajuk, just announced a new \u201cmaster plan\u201d for Dhaka that included expanding the city limits, building a series of ring roads and preserving wetlands and areas of conservation. While many stakeholders \u2014 such as the mayors of Dhaka North and South, who were not consulted \u2014 have criticized the new plan, everyone agrees that it\u2019s time to take radical steps to put the city right.\nMeanwhile, Jahaj Bari is due for demolition. Social media are alight with calls to declare the building a heritage site. In a city that has changed so rapidly, where no landmark seems sacred, even a hideous boat-shaped monstrosity can provoke nostalgia.",

    "text": "Bangladeshi Women, Isolated in New York City, Need More Support, Advocates Say\n2015-08-14T00:16:07.000Z\nA 3-week-old baby ended up dead in the courtyard of an apartment building in Queens. The police arrested the mother, Rashida Chowdhury, a 21-year-old Bangladeshi immigrant, on charges of second-degree murder. They said she confessed to throwing the baby out the bathroom window of her fourth-floor apartment because she thought the child was possessed by an evil spirit.\nBeyond those stark facts, little is publicly known about the case or what led to the baby\u2019s death early in the morning on Aug. 7. Still, the episode has resonated deeply among social service providers and advocates who have been trying to address mental health problems, particularly among women, in the growing Bangladeshi population in New York City.\nDepression is widespread, these advocates and service providers say, often born of cultural and geographic isolation worsened by economic hardship and financial dependence on spouses.\n\u201cThe women are becoming victims of everything,\u201d said Rokeya Akhter, a Bangladeshi immigrant who leads the New American Women\u2019s Forum of New York, a group that seeks to empower Bangladeshi immigrant women. \u201cThe women come to this country with an American dream in their minds and the situation sometimes is totally different. Women are going through so much frustration and they become depressed.\u201d\nThe Bangladeshi population \u2014 with significant concentrations in the Jackson Heights, Elmhurst and Jamaica neighborhoods of Queens \u2014 has been one of the fastest-growing immigrant groups in the city over the past few decades. It now numbers about 76,000, up from about 2,000 in 1980, making it the ninth largest foreign-born group in the city, according to the latest census data.\nIt is also among the poorest, with poverty and overcrowding rates that are among the highest compared with those of the city\u2019s other large immigrant groups.\nMany new Bangladeshi immigrants \u2014 and even some who have been here for many years \u2014 speak little or no English, further worsening the challenges of integration, advocates and community leaders say.\nArranged marriages are also common, with brides either sent to join their husbands in the United States or traveling with their spouses from Bangladesh.\n\u201cA lot of the women are older and come with husbands,\u201d said Alison Karasz, executive director of Sapna NYC, a group based in the Bronx that is focused on the social, economic and health-related needs of South Asian women. \u201cBut sometimes young girls come and don\u2019t know their husbands.\u201d\nEven when the United States is new territory for both spouses, however, they may operate under different sets of rules once they arrive. While the men leave the home to work and circulate among the broader society, many women, because of cultural mores or child-care obligations, have to stay home, further depriving them of the ability to cultivate a support network.\nAfreen Alam, executive director of Chhaya Community Development Corporation, a Queens group focused on housing and economic development in the South Asian population, says some women are prohibited by their husbands from having a job and lack their own financial control.\nAccording to census data, Bangladeshi immigrant women have one of the lowest rates of labor force participation among the major immigrant groups in the city. Without their own source of income, advocates say, women are further isolated \u2014 an aspect of what Ms. Alam calls \u201cthe economics of gender disparity.\u201d\n\u201cMen, they come to this country, they\u2019re going out, they\u2019re working, they\u2019re socializing with other people,\u201d Ms. Akhter said. \u201cBut the women, they don\u2019t. They are here like a prisoner.\u201d\nReshmi Sengupta, programs director for Sakhi for South Asian Women, a Manhattan group that works with victims of domestic violence, said the isolation can be so enduring, some women \u201cmay not know how to travel the subways even though they\u2019ve been in this country for 20 years.\u201d\nAccording to the authorities and neighbors, Ms. Chowdhury had been living for at least several months with her 40-year-old husband, Mohamad Ahmad, in an apartment building in the Richmond Hill neighborhood. The couple and their baby, Rizwan Ahmad, apparently shared a two-bedroom apartment with Mr. Ahmad\u2019s brother and sister as well as her sister\u2019s two young children. \nIt remained unclear, however, how Mr. Ahmad and Ms. Chowdhury met and married or how long they have been living in the United States. Phone messages left for Ms. Chowdhury\u2019s lawyer, Steven Goldenberg, were not answered, and the family did not respond to messages left at their address.\nThe emergence of social service organizations to help Bangladeshi immigrants, particularly women, has lagged behind the population\u2019s meteoric growth. One of the most glaring shortfalls, advocates say, is in the availability of mental health services provided by practitioners fluent in Bengali and Bangladeshi culture.\n\u201cI get requests on a regular basis for counseling for family members from professionals who speak the language,\u201d Ms. Alam said. But, she added, she has been \u201chard pressed\u201d to find appropriate therapists.\nAt the same time, many Bangladeshis are unaware of the range of social services that are available to them, including those provided by governmental agencies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very new community; they\u2019re still learning the different ins and outs,\u201d said Dilip Nath, a Bangladeshi immigrant and president of New American Voters Association, which encourages immigrant participation in the political process. \u201cIf there\u2019s a mental issue, I hope they can reach out. But they don\u2019t know of the services available.\u201d\nIn the absence of many community groups beyond the mosques attended by the immigrants, social service and advocacy groups often rely on word of mouth to reach prospective clients. Doctors\u2019 offices, hospitals and \u2014 in the case of some domestic abuse victims \u2014 the police are also sources of referrals.\nBut advocates and service providers say that no matter how robust their efforts to reach the most isolated and vulnerable members of the community, they still feel they are a long way from meeting the demand.",

    "text": "The Price of Damming Tibet\u2019s Rivers\n2015-03-30T14:17:15.000Z\nNEW DELHI \u2014 CHINA has more than 26,000 large dams, more than the rest of the world combined. They feed its insatiable demand for energy and supply water for mining, manufacturing and agriculture.\nIn 2011, when China was already generating more than a fifth of the total hydropower in the world, the leadership announced that it would aim to double the country\u2019s hydropower capacity within a decade, so as to reduce its heavy dependency on coal-fired power plants. Since the waterways of mainland China are already packed with dams, this new hydropower output could come from only one place: the rivers of Tibet.\nRivers gushing through deep canyons at the edges of the Tibetan plateau hold the highest hydropower potential in the world. The headwaters of seven major rivers are in Tibet: They flow into the world\u2019s largest deltas and spread in an arc across Asia.\nTwo of the continent\u2019s wildest rivers have their sources in Tibet: the Salween and the Brahmaputra. Though they are under threat from retreating glaciers, a more immediate concern is Chinese engineering plans. A cascade of five large dams is planned for both the Salween, which now flows freely, and the Brahmaputra, where one dam is already operational.\nThe damming does not benefit those who live in Tibet. The energy generated is transferred to power-hungry industrial cities farther east. Tibetans are forcibly deprived of their land; protests against hydropower projects are prohibited or violently dispersed.\nEven more alarming are projects to divert the waters of Tibet\u2019s rivers for use in mines, factories and other industries. At the eastern edge of Tibet, a planned mega-diversion from south to north would move water from the Yangtze to the Yellow, China\u2019s two greatest rivers. Other plans call for diversion of water from the Brahmaputra, Salween and Mekong \u2014 all rivers that cross national boundaries. Including China itself, up to two billion people downstream from Tibet depend on these rivers. Damming and diverting them will have a severe impact on their lives and environment, especially when you consider that rice and wheat require water-intensive cultivation.\nRivers support entire ecosystems. They carry tons of nutrient-rich silt downstream, a cocktail of elements needed for growing plants: nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and calcium. Silt is essential for agriculture and for bolstering the deltas against rising sea levels. Dams block silt, and they block fish migration. The Yangtze is China\u2019s biggest freshwater fishery, but since the Three Gorges Dam that spans it was completed in 2012, the downstream population of carp has fallen by 90 percent, according to Guo Qiaoyu of the Nature Conservancy in Beijing.\nVietnam, Cambodia and Bangladesh heavily depend on rivers sourced in Tibet. More than 60 percent of Cambodia\u2019s annual fish catch derives from Tonle Sap, a lake that is replenished by the annual flooding of the Mekong. Over the last decade, as new Chinese dams have come online on the Mekong, the fish catch has plummeted. The waters rise and fall at the whim of Chinese engineers.\nThen there are the direct human costs of damming and diverting: Whole communities must be relocated from areas flooded by a reservoir. They are often shifted to degraded land, where they live in poverty or have to relocate once again. By some estimates, hydropower projects have forced some 22 million Chinese to migrate since the 1950s.\nIn Tibet, since the 1990s, at least a million nomads and farmers \u2014 a sixth of the population \u2014 have been relocated from grasslands to make way for mining ventures and hydropower projects. These \u201cecological refugees\u201d are shunted into ghettos. Moreover, China claims complete sovereignty over Tibet\u2019s rivers, oblivious to protest from Tibetans and from the people downstream. \nThe United Nations has done too little, too late. In 2014, the Watercourses Convention came into effect, spelling out guidelines for transboundary water sharing, but it is nonbinding. More to the point, China is not a signatory \u2014 and neither are most nations of South Asia.\nThis will end badly for the nations downstream from Tibet, which are competing for scarce water. Damming and water diversion could also end badly for China, by destroying the sources of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers.\nThe solution to these complex problems is simple: Since these enormous projects are state-run and state-financed, China\u2019s leaders can cancel them at will. Though campaigns by Chinese environmentalists have stopped some dam projects, the pro-dam lobby, backed by Chinese consortiums, is powerful. There are alternatives to disrupting the rivers: China has made great investments in solar and wind power, but has not significantly deployed them in Tibet.\nChina\u2019s leaders need to consider the costs of forging ahead with these projects. The health of these rivers is of vital concern to all of Asia. ",

    "text": "Migrant or Refugee? There Is a Difference, With Legal Implications\n2015-08-27T21:11:52.000Z\nIn the first half of this year alone, at least 137,000 men, women and children crossed the Mediterranean Sea to reach the shores of Europe, according to the United Nations. Thousands are traveling across the Balkans now.\nQ. Does it matter what you call them? \nA. Yes. The terms \u201cmigrant\u201d and \u201crefugee\u201d are sometimes used interchangeably, but there is a crucial legal difference between the two.\nIn recent months European nations have worked to block the main route taken by migrants fleeing war and upheaval.\nQ. Who is a refugee? \nA. Briefly, a refugee is person who has fled his or her country to escape war or persecution, and can prove it. \nThe 1951 Refugee Convention, negotiated after World War II, defines a refugee as a person who, \u201cowing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\u201d\nAmong those crossing the Mediterranean in the first half of 2015, the greatest numbers came from Syria, Afghanistan or Eritrea. Syrians are widely presumed to be refugees because of the civil war there, according to the United Nations refugee agency. Many Afghans have been able to make the case that they are fleeing conflict, the agency added, and Eritreans can generally argue that they would face political persecution at home in Eritrea, which is ruled by one of the world\u2019s most repressive regimes.\nQ. What does the distinction mean for European countries? \nA. Refugees are entitled to basic protections under the 1951 convention and other international agreements. Once in Europe, refugees can apply for political asylum or another protected status, sometimes temporary. By law, refugees cannot be sent back to countries where their lives would be in danger. \u201cOne of the most fundamental principles laid down in international law is that refugees should not be expelled or returned to situations where their life and freedom would be under threat,\u201d the refugee agency said in a statement on Thursday.\nEuropean Union officials struggle to cope with the growing crisis.\nQ. Who is a migrant? \nA. Anyone moving from one country to another is considered a migrant unless he or she is specifically fleeing war or persecution. Migrants may be fleeing dire poverty, or may be well-off and merely seeking better opportunities, or may be migrating to join relatives who have gone before them. There is an emerging debate about whether migrants fleeing their homes because of the effects of climate change \u2014 the desertification of the Sahel region, for example, or the sinking of coastal islands in Bangladesh \u2014 ought to be reclassified as refugees.\nQ. Are migrants treated differently from refugees? \nA. Countries are free to deport migrants who arrive without legal papers, which they cannot do with refugees under the 1951 convention. So it is not surprising that many politicians in Europe prefer to refer to everyone fleeing to the continent as migrants.\nQ. Which term applies to the flood of people reaching Europe now? \nA. The United Nations refugee agency says that most of them are refugees, though some are considered migrants. \u201cThe majority of people arriving this year in Italy and Greece, especially, have been from countries mired in war or which otherwise are considered to be \u2018refugee-producing,\u2019 and for whom international protection is needed,\u201d the refugee agency said. \u201cHowever, a smaller proportion is from elsewhere, and for many of these individuals, the term \u2018migrant\u2019 would be correct.\u201d Human traffickers make no such distinctions, though; refugees and migrants are often jammed into the same rickety boats for the crossing.\nQ. How does the United States see the issue? \nA. Admitting refugees is somewhat different in the United States. The State Department vets a select number of people \u2014 lately, around 70,000 a year \u2014 and admits them as refugees. Others who arrive in the country without legal papers can apply for political asylum; in that case, a judge decides on the merits of their claims.",

    "text": "Oriental Star Accident Highlights\u00a0Increase in Safety Problems on Yangtze Cruises\n2015-06-02T16:37:29.000Z\nBEIJING \u2014 For much of recorded history, traveling up the Yangtze meant braving turbulent currents and shoals. In recent years, a more prosaic risk has been growing: poorly maintained ships and inexperienced crews.\nNature can still play a role. Initial reports indicate that the capsizing of a cruise ship on Monday may have been partly caused by hurricane-force winds that hit the ship. But most of the challenges facing passenger ships in China\u2019s waterways are economic, brought about by cutthroat competition in the passenger ship industry.\nHigh-end cruises have become popular as China has seen the rise of a wealthy class of tourists. Large companies such as Carnival Group have moved personnel to China, now second only to the United States in the number of cruise passengers. In 2014, the number of tourists on cruises leapt 43 percent from the year before to 862,000, according to an industry report. Industry estimates say that by 2020, the Chinese cruise ship industry might grow to 4.5 million passengers and could have an economic impact of $8 billion.\nRiver travel up China\u2019s waterways is a different story. Industry data and reports suggest that at best, the number of tourists traveling the Yangtze has stagnated, and many of them are budget-conscious retirees. According to a report in The Yangtze Daily, 408,000 tourists traveled on boats in 2002, when the Three Gorges Dam was built. Since then, tourism has grown slowly: 450,000 took cruises to the Three Gorges in 2011, the most recent year for which numbers are available.\nA separate report from the Hubei tourism board showed that the number of tourists going to the Three Gorges, the primary destination for Yangtze cruises, dropped 3 percent in the first half of 2013 compared with the same period the year before.\nSome of the danger of traveling the Yangtze has been tamed by technological prowess. The Three Gorges Dam has made the river much less choppy, especially through the gorges where the Oriental Star, the boat carrying 456 passengers and crew on Monday, was heading. According to a senior marine safety official from Chongqing cited by the Xinhua news agency last year, that city once averaged 57 accidents a year but now has just 13 on average.\nBut while the dam has calmed the river by flooding the gorges, it has made them less spectacular, reducing the appeal for high-end travelers. It also flooded major cultural sites. That caused international tourism to plummet, and luxury ships that used to charge 3,700 renminbi, or about $600, for standard rooms sometimes now charge just 1,000 renminbi.\nAt about 9:20 p.m. that evening, the Oriental Star had passed a cargo ship that had anchored to wait out the storm.\nAt the same time, inspectors have noticed an increasing number of problems among the ships. In 2013, the Nanjing Maritime Bureau found that six of 10 Yangtze cruise ferries had safety problems. In one case, the crew did not know how to put on life jackets and failed to tell passengers about safety precautions after they boarded. Also that year, a passenger ferry with 415 tourists caught fire, although it was towed to safety and no one was injured.\nA survey of shipping companies on the Yangtze showed that 63 percent said they had difficulty hiring experienced, qualified sailors. Over half said they had to go to remote, impoverished regions to find crew members. The primary reason was low pay, with a captain earning just 7,000 renminbi a month, or about $1,100.\nThe accident Monday is reviving calls for better safety in domestic shipping in East Asia. The loss of the Oriental Star comes less than six weeks after government officials from mostly East Asian nations held a conference in Manila to discuss the need for improved safety in local shipping. Prompted by the loss of the Sewol, a South Korean ferry that capsized on April 16 last year, killing 304 people, the conference was convened by the International Maritime Organization to strengthen regulations on passenger ships serving domestic routes.\nDomestic cruises and domestic ferry traffic are not subject to a wide range of international safety rules. \u201cThere is an urgent need to enhance the safety of ships carrying passengers on noninternational voyages in certain parts of the world,\u201d said a joint statement by the conference attendees.\ntranscript\nna\nArthur Bowring, the managing director of the Hong Kong Shipowners Association, said Tuesday that the capsizing of the Oriental Star had echoes of last year\u2019s accident in South Korea. \u201cIt\u2019s just so sad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost exactly like the Sewol.\u201d\nAccording to statistics compiled by the Worldwide Ferry Safety Association in New York, 16,881 people died or were missing in domestic passenger shipping accidents around the world from late 2000 through September of last year.\nChina had a total of 86 dead and missing from nine accidents in this period, the association\u2019s data show. That does not include Monday\u2019s accident, or the capsizing of a ship in the Yangtze in June 2000 that killed 121 people. Three countries had more fatal domestic shipping accidents during the same time period: Bangladesh, with 37; Indonesia, with 25; and the Philippines, with 14.\nBut 20 countries have had more deaths than China despite fewer accidents. Senegal had only one accident in this period, but it killed 1,863 people, said Johan Roos, the director of regulatory affairs at Interferry, a trade association of the global ferry industry that is based in Victoria, British Columbia. At the Manila conference in April, there was a clear consensus after the Sewol tragedy that domestic shipping safety standards would have to improve in Asia, said Dracos Vassalos, a professor of maritime safety at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\u201cMost of the domestic ships don\u2019t even have basic regulations,\u201d Professor Vassalos said. \u201cIf we can do that, many lives will be saved.\u201d",

    "text": "Turmoil Between Political Leaders Has Harmed Bangladesh\u2019s People\n2015-04-13T00:19:40.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 The quickest way to grasp the nastiness of Bangladesh\u2019s season of political turmoil is to visit the high dependency unit at Dhaka Medical College Hospital.\nThis is the ward for burn victims from roadside firebomb attacks, collateral damage from the long battle between Bangladesh\u2019s \u201ctwo ladies,\u201d as the country\u2019s two most important political leaders are known. On a recent morning, Mohammad Nazmul Mollah looked down the row of beds at three men who had been riding beside him in a truck, after unloading a shipment of sand, when a firebomb thrown by a protester smashed through the windshield.\nMr. Mollah, 25, was the lucky one, having jumped out the passenger-side window so quickly that his worst injuries were fractures to bones and kneecaps. The eight men to his right were unlucky: five died, and others came out with seared tracheas, faces stripped of skin, eyelids swollen to slits. Asked what he would say to the country\u2019s political leaders, he spoke dully.\n\u201cThey are killing ordinary people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are killing their own brothers.\u201d \nThere are few in Bangladesh who do not sound exhausted this spring. The country was thrust into disarray in January, when the opposition leader Khaleda Zia declared an indefinite campaign of strikes and transport blockades, hoping to pressure her rival, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, into holding new national elections. Yet if Mrs. Zia was expecting compromise, none came. \nPolitical tension relaxed in recent weeks, and life has largely returned to normal on Dhaka\u2019s streets, but there is no long-term solution in sight. Among those watching closely were the country\u2019s leaders of industry. \nA World Bank report released on Sunday showed that Bangladesh\u2019s economy lost $2.2 billion, or around 1 percent of gross domestic product, as a result of 62 days of political unrest this year. The report said the country\u2019s economic growth rate would be 5.6 percent this fiscal year \u2014 compared\u00a0with\u00a06.6 percent the bank had predicted before the strikes began. \n\u201cHow long can you remain resilient if day after day, year after year, you keep hurting industry?\u201d Zahid Hussain, lead economist in the World Bank\u2019s Dhaka office, said in an interview. \u201cEventually the ability to recoup is affected.\u201d\nThe violence can be traced to nationwide elections in January 2014, which set off a battle of wills between the two ladies.\nMrs. Zia, a former prime minister whose Bangladesh Nationalist Party, or B.N.P., leads a 20-party opposition alliance, threatened to boycott the polls, suggesting that they would be rigged in the government\u2019s favor. Mrs. Hasina called her bluff and held an election that excluded the alliance, issuing vague promises of repeat elections in the coming months. This January, after a year of waiting, Mrs. Zia declared an indefinite protest campaign.\nMore than 100 Bangladeshis have died, and many more have been horribly injured, in roadside bombings. By blocking highways, often violently, the protesters targeted the weakest link in the supply chain. The government has responded with increasingly harsh measures, and many of Mrs. Zia\u2019s party leaders either have been arrested or are in hiding. B.N.P. officials deny responsibility for the violence but say they had no option besides blockades and strikes.\n\u201cI saw the agonies of the burned people, their maimed bodies, the smell of burning flesh,\u201d acknowledged Mahbubur Rahman, a retired army general and member of the B.N.P.\u2019s national standing committee. \u201cBut what we say is that the government is not allowing us to talk. Not allowing us to assemble. Not allowing us to protest, to make our news. In this situation, where the democratic rights are denied, what else can we do?\u201d\nThe campaign hurt the entire country: students whose schools shut down before examinations; farmers who watched their crops rot; tourist resorts reporting near-total vacancy. But no sector matters as much as the garment industry, which accounts for 80 percent of Bangladesh\u2019s exports and faces stiff competition from factories in Cambodia and Vietnam.\nShabbir Mahmood, who has two plants that employ 820 workers, felt the damage immediately.\nOf the four companies that regularly give him orders, two canceled their January buying visits out of security concerns. Orders for February and March fell to half the plants\u2019 capacity, leaving him no choice but to furlough workers. This made it all the more vital to guarantee prompt deliveries for his remaining buyers.\nYet he did not have the heart to order terrified drivers to haul goods to the nearest port in Chittagong, a 160-mile journey that takes six hours under normal circumstances.\n\u201cThey came to me and said, \u2018Sir, how will we drive? How will we go across the road if they try throwing bombs?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Mahmood said, and he shrugged. \u201cI can give them money, but I cannot give them their lives back.\u201d In the end, he paid out of pocket to send two or three shipments by air.\nMr. Mahmood has delayed the planned fall opening of a third factory, this one to employ 2,000 workers; if the strikes continue, he will delay again. Though manufacturers have lobbied both Mrs. Zia and Mrs. Hasina to pursue a negotiated settlement for the sake of the economy, he said, they have had no success.\n\u201cWho will care? The government will not care,\u201d Mr. Mahmood said. \u201cTextile people always tell them this, but they do not care.\u201d\nGovernment officials, and some economists, say the economy is resilient enough to weather moderate political strife, and note that the biggest garment businesses managed to move their cargo to port in a timely fashion through the worst violence, in January and February.\nStill, the disruptions have compounded problems that resulted from the 2013 collapse of the Rana Plaza garment factory on the outskirts of Dhaka, which claimed more than 1,100 lives. Factories are straining to comply with new safety and wage standards, and to rebuild investor confidence in Bangladesh.\u00a0 If the turmoil resumes in the second quarter, forecasters with the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association say, exports could fall 25 to 30 percent starting in May.\nKhurrum Siddique, director of Simco Dresses Ltd., a manufacturer based in a suburb north of Dhaka, described the political uncertainty as \u201ca disaster, a man-made disaster.\u201d He said his company was reconsidering plans for investment this year.\n\u201cWe have no ethnic, linguistic or sectarian problems in Bangladesh, especially compared to Pakistan or India,\u201d Mr. Siddique said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why this issue can\u2019t be solved over a cup of tea.\u201d\nFor garment workers, a large number of them women, the stakes are also high. In the Mirpur neighborhood of Dhaka, where workers sleep five to a rented room, many are already complaining of lost overtime, saying their workday now ends around 4 or 5 p.m. instead of 9 or 10. This is no small matter, since rent and food eat up nearly all of their base monthly pay of around 6,000 taka, or about $77. \nAsk what they would do if manufacturers began laying off workers, and the answer is sobering. Most were landless villagers, and workers said they would have few options beyond day labor for 50 taka, or about 65 cents, a day. Women in the villages rarely bring in income, so they are heavily reliant on their husbands, and many say they would not consider returning until they could open their own businesses.\n\u201cIf I go back to the village with empty hands, with no savings, it would be the worst thing in my life,\u201d said Momena Akhter, 30. \nOne of her neighbors, Mahmuda Khatun, 55, said she had no doubt who would be to blame if the industry entered a downturn. \u201cThe government is responsible for all these things,\u201d Ms. Khatun said, a fist planted on her hip. \u201cI will tell them: You are responsible. I will blame them. I will say it is because of you that all of this is happening.\u201d",

    "text": "New Research May Solve Puzzle in Sea Level\u2019s Rise\n2015-01-14T23:19:54.000Z\nA team of researchers reported Wednesday that the ocean did not rise quite as much as previously believed in the 20th century. They proposed a seemingly tiny adjustment that could make a big difference in scientific understanding of the looming problem of sea-level rise.\nInstead of rising about six inches over the course of the 20th century, as previous research suggested, the sea actually rose by approximately five inches, the team from Harvard and Rutgers Universities found. The difference turns out to be an immense amount of water: on the order of two quadrillion gallons, or enough to fill three billion Olympic-size swimming pools.\nIf the findings stand up to scrutiny by other scientists, they could help resolve a longstanding conundrum in climate research. For years, when experts added up their best measurements of melt water from land ice and of other factors causing the sea to rise, the numbers fell a bit short of the rise that had been recorded at harbors around the world.\nIf the harbor measurements were right and the ocean really had two quadrillion gallons of extra water, where was it coming from? The discrepancy set off an intensive search for additional ice that might be melting from glaciers and ice sheets, or extra heat that might be causing ocean water to expand, and so on. To some scientists, the answers that emerged were never entirely satisfactory.\nNow, in a paper published Wednesday by the journal Nature, the Harvard and Rutgers scientists applied advanced statistical techniques to the measurements taken at harbors. They found that previous research on that record had slightly overestimated the amount of sea-level rise in the 20th century. With their downward revision, the harbor record now matches the other records rather neatly.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s right, it\u2019s pretty important,\u201d said Peter U. Clark, a geologist at Oregon State University who studies sea level but was not involved in the new research. John A. Church, a scientist with Australia\u2019s national scientific organization and a prominent researcher on sea level, echoed that view, but both men said they would like to see more details of the research before passing final judgment.\nThe main significance of the paper, if it holds up, may be to increase scientists\u2019 confidence that they understand precisely why the ocean is rising \u2014 and therefore shore up their ability to project future increases.\nA United Nations subcommittee led by Dr. Clark and Dr. Church said last year that if human emissions of greenhouse gases continued at a high level, the sea could rise as much as three feet by the end of this century, or possibly even more in the worst case. The research from Harvard and Rutgers has already set off efforts to develop new forecasts, with results due in the coming months.\nThe new paper was led by two young researchers, Carling C. Hay and Eric Morrow, working with two senior scientists, Robert E. Kopp of Rutgers and Jerry X. Mitrovica of Harvard.\nGiven that observers have been taking measurements at harbors for centuries, using devices called tide gauges, it might seem a simple problem to figure out how much the ocean has been rising. It is anything but simple, though: The tide-gauge record is plagued by gaps; the land to which many of the gauges are attached has itself moved over time; and factors like wind and ocean currents can cause variability of the sea level in particular locales. Moreover, the early harbor measurements were concentrated in Europe and the United States, leaving much of the world a blank.\nThe Harvard and Rutgers researchers believe their new statistical techniques do a better job than past research of accounting for the confounding variables, but they do not claim to have published the last word on the subject. \u201cOne of the main takeaway messages is that sea level is really complicated,\u201d Dr. Hay said in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a complete understanding of what\u2019s been happening.\u201d\nIf the paper represents an advance in climate science, that silver cloud comes with a dark lining. The new research confirms numerous previous estimates that the rate of sea-level rise jumped substantially toward the end of the 20th century. The ocean now appears to be rising at a rate of about a foot per century.\nThat would be worrisome enough, since mere inches of sea-level rise have been enough to force governments to spend billions of dollars to fight coastal erosion. But recent research suggests that the great ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are starting to break up as a result of global warming, a development that will send quadrillions of additional gallons of water pouring into the ocean. Many scientists see the recent jump in the rate as the beginning of a more troubling long-term acceleration that may ultimately threaten coastal cities around the world.\nAlready, tidal flooding is growing worse and causing severe problems in cities like Norfolk and Miami Beach, and in whole countries like Bangladesh.",

    "text": "Charge for Plastic Bags in Britain Draws Applause, Anger and Humor\n2015-10-06T15:26:27.000Z\nLONDON \u2014 Some warned of \u201cbag rage\u201d by irate shoppers. The Daily Mail predicted, \u201cPlastic Bags Chaos Looms.\u201d Chloe Metzger, a 21-year-old blogger and student, wrote on Twitter: \u201cI understand the whole #plasticbags thing but it couldn\u2019t be more annoying.\u201d\nNerves were rattled, jokes were made and the annoyance of it all was duly noted in Britain this week. Nevertheless, shoppers pulled off something that has also occurred in other cities, states and countries: They began weaning themselves off plastic shopping bags.\nStarting this week, the government introduced a 5 pence charge for plastic bags for most groceries, clothes and other purchased items. And while it did not lead to a nationwide mutiny, as some had warned, it did create some tension in cashier lines.\nThe British government imposed the charge, which started on Monday, as a way to reduce pollution and waste. When bags are not flying in the breeze, entangled in trees or floating down waterways, they are taking up space in landfills \u2014 and it can take 1,000 years for a plastic bag to decompose, according to an estimate by Nick Clegg, who was deputy prime minister at the time the charge was announced.\nLast year, major supermarkets in England handed out roughly 7.6 billion single-use plastic bags, about 140 per person, the government has estimated. Charging for them is not only meant to encourage people to use cloth or other renewable bags, they said; it also could save and make money.\nThe government estimates that the fee, equivalent to about 8 cents, will help reduce the cost of cleaning up garbage by 60 million pounds, or about $80 million, over the next decade. Stores and supermarkets are being encouraged to donate the proceeds from the bag charge to charities, which could also drive \u00a3730 million ($1.1 billion) to charitable causes, officials said.\nSome critics warned that shoppers would be confused by the long list of exemptions. Shoppers can still get a free plastic bag if they are buying pet fish; raw fish, meat or poultry; unwrapped blades (including axes, knives and razor blades); takeout food; or loose seeds and flowers.\nThere are also worries that customers might verbally abuse supermarket cashiers, and some retailers have provided members of their staff with training on how to cope with angry shoppers.\nThen there were concerns that shoppers would throng the British capital\u2019s already crowded streets, clutching, for example, jars of tomato sauce. One man who did not want to pay for a plastic bag for a single item was seen walking down a street in North London holding a package of wrapped salmon.\nThe new rules in England apply to retailers with more than 250 full-time employees. Retailers that fail to properly enforce the measure can be fined up to \u00a35,000 (about $7,600).\nSimilar charges for plastic bags exist in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, but that seems to have had no influence on the critics. In Wales, where a more extensive charging program was introduced, use of plastic bags has dropped 79 percent since a charge of 5 pence was put in effect in 2011.\nSimilar efforts to regulate plastic bags have been put in place across the world.\nIn 2002, Bangladesh became the first country to introduce a ban on thin plastic bags because of concerns that they were clogging drainage pipes and contributing to devastating flooding.\nIn 2008, Rwanda banned plastic bags, helping to solidify its image as one of the most environmentally conscious nations in East Africa.\nIn the United States, many communities have regulated or even prohibited the bags. Since 2007, they have been banned in nearly 100 municipalities in California, including Los Angeles. In 2014, California banned stores from giving out free plastic bags. The law was to take effect in July, but after lobbying by opponents of the bill, including the bag industry, a referendum on whether to repeal the ban is planned for November 2016.\nOnly a tiny fraction of plastic bags are recycled. \u201cPlastic bags end up everywhere \u2014 stashed in cupboards, floating down canals, littering our streets or killing wildlife,\u201d Friends of the Earth, a British environmental group, said in a statement welcoming the new measure in England.\nThe TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, an anti-tax group, said the new measure would burden families struggling to get by.\nA 2013 study by the National Center for Policy Analysis in Washington, which champions laissez-faire economics, argued that paper and reusable bags were worse for the environment than plastic bags when it came to energy and water use, and to greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cEvery type of grocery bag incurs environmental costs,\u201d wrote H. Sterling Burnett, the author of the study.\nWhatever the arguments, the charge has inspired a mix of applause, resentment, fear and humor.\nIt has also inspired ingenious new ways to try to get around paying the new fee. The Daily Express, a British tabloid, noted that there was \u201cnothing to stop Brits buying loose vegetables, being rewarded with their free plastic bag and ramming it full of the rest of the shopping.\u201d",

    "text": "Pakistan Soccer in Turmoil, Both Off the Field and On\n2015-12-23T10:51:16.000Z\nPakistan\u2019s national team was scheduled to face the host India on Wednesday in the opening game of the 2015 South Asian Football Federation Championship, but it won\u2019t play after Pakistan\u2019s soccer federation withdrew from the tournament in November. \nIt was the latest soccer-related turmoil for Pakistan, whose biggest rival seems to be itself at the moment and where most action takes place not on the field, but in the courts. \nThe national team has not played since March, and the withdrawal from the eight-team SAFF tournament means the inaction will continue well into 2016. Ranked No.184 in the world by FIFA, Pakistan has never won the competition, but the decision not to participate at all was met with fierce criticism at home.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great loss for football and the players,\u201d acknowledged Sardar Naveed Haider Khan, the vice president of the Pakistan Football Federation. \u201cI feel sorry for them. It hurts as these games are opportunities to be seen by scouts by clubs.\u201d \nKhan is instead preoccupied with legal issues. \u201cWe are hoping our situation will be resolved early,\u201d he said. \nIn June, Faisal Saleh Hayat was suspended as president by the P.F.F. after allegations of mismanagement and financial irregularities. Hayat went ahead with an election on June 30 anyway and won a fourth term. \nFIFA recognized Hayat\u2019s victory, but the Lahore High Court did not and appointed Asad Munir, a former judge, to run the P.F.F. in August, though FIFA did not recognize the move and in September threatened sanctions over what it sees as government interference in the sport.\nMunir currently controls the federation\u2019s funds but does not have the authority to send teams to international tournaments. The P.F.F. does have the authority to send teams, but Khan said it does not have the financial means to do so. \u201cIf the accounts are restored in our name, then we can move forward, and it takes money to organize training camps and games, but that is under the control of the administrator.\u201d\nUmaid Wasim, a sports reporter for the national newspaper Dawn, said he believes that the federation could have sent a team to the SAFF Championship had it been inclined to work with Munir.\n\u201cThe Hayat faction claims that it didn\u2019t have funds to send the team,\u201d Wasim said. \u201cSAFF is a fully paid trip by the organizers, so money shouldn\u2019t have been an issue. I strongly believe that the P.F.F. never intended to send a team.\u201d \nWasim said that after poor results in March, after the team was eliminated by Yemen in the first Asian qualifying round for the 2018 World Cup, the federation was wary of more criticism.\nAt the moment, the national team is without a coach after Mohammed al-Shamlan returned to his native Bahrain in June. \nHis predecessor, Zavisa Milosavljevic of Serbia, was head coach from 2011 to 2013 and has mixed memories. \u201cI can only say that the P.F.F. did not pay me my last salary payment from my contract and money for food for two years. It is about $15,000. Where that money went, I do not know.\u201d He said other coaches were awaiting payment, too. \nFor Wasim, this is just one example of mismanagement and even worse. The journalist said that of the eight projects in Pakistan under FIFA\u2019s Goal program \u2014 initiatives that help nations develop facilities \u2014 only one ever came to fruition: the P.F.F.\u2019s headquarters in Lahore.\n\u201cThe one in Peshawar \u2014 awarded in 2006 \u2014 is canceled, and it isn\u2019t mentioned on the FIFA website anymore. They did construct a building there, but that facility now lies in ruins,\u201d Wasim said.\n\u201cThe Karachi Goal Project was also given in 2006 and till now it doesn\u2019t have a playing field,\u201d he added, \u201calthough a deserted building stands.\u201d \nWasim also disputes the P.F.F.\u2019s assertion that the money went directly from FIFA to contractors. Amid numerous other allegations, earlier in December, Dawn reported that officials sold their allocations of World Cup tickets at inflated prices.\nOther allegations center on a $400,000 donation made by the former FIFA vice president Chung Mong-joon and $250,000 from the Asian Football Confederation to help rebuild facilities damaged after floods. According to reports in Dawn, the project was never started.\nKhan denied any wrongdoing. \u201cWhenever there are two factions and they are fighting, one side spreads allegations. Whatever financial assistance was provided by the A.F.C. and FIFA, it was all audited. They don\u2019t release the second installment until the first stage is completed. If it is not done properly, future funding is stopped.\u201d \nKhan blamed the reports on \u201coutsiders who are passing this to the media.\u201d\n\u201cFIFA and A.F.C. have paid the money but are not complaining; they are satisfied,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWhat proof has been put forward?\u201d\nAll the while, Pakistan soccer continues to fall behind regional rivals. Milosavljevic believes the problem lies with the leaders. \u201cWhere is Pakistan in the FIFA ranking list?\u201d he asked.\n Of the 46 A.F.C. teams ranked by FIFA, only six are ranked lower than Pakistan\u2019s 184th. Immediately above Pakistan in the rankings are Chinese Taipei and Bangladesh (tied at 182) and Cambodia (180.)\nFor Milosavljevic, there is potential in the country. \u201cAll children in the world have the same potential and talent, but talent without professionalism and long-term work, very quickly disappears. When the federation changes the system of youth development and brings in professional coaching staff, we can expect football progress.\u201d",

    "text": "For Indians, Smog and Poverty Are Higher Priorities Than Talks in Paris\n2015-12-09T22:05:20.000Z\nMUMBAI \u2014 Under a fingernail moon at Sassoon Docks, Parumati Mangela, a fisherwoman, sat on her haunches, grimacing. Something strange is happening over the Arabian Sea, she said: \u201cThe sky is getting hot more and more,\u201d perhaps because something has angered the goddess Lakshmi.\nAs Ms. Mangela rounded up village women to pray at the water\u2019s edge, state fisheries scientists were tracking worrying changes in the water, where in the last half century average surface temperatures have risen three-tenths of a degree Celsius, or half a degree Fahrenheit. This warming is driving familiar species into cooler waters, they say, replaced by species traditionally found hundreds of miles to the south, like Indian mackerel and oil sardines.\nAt the climate talks in Paris, India\u2019s negotiators have staked out an adamant position: While India is vulnerable to global warming, raising a vast population out of poverty remains the national priority. The government plans to double use of domestic coal to more than a billion tons by 2019, and maintains that the legal obligation for action on climate change should fall on developed countries, which burned huge amounts of fossil fuels for decades.\nBut few countries have so much at stake as India. For the last month, the front pages of major newspapers have been dominated by one environmental crisis after another: City-dwellers are up in arms about hazardous levels of air pollution, which has already damaged the lungs of about half of Delhi\u2019s schoolchildren. And last month brought torrential rains and flooding in the southern city of Chennai, evoking the erratic weather that climate experts warn about.\n\u201cPeople are experiencing far more, and the impacts are far more severe,\u201d said Arivudai Nambi Appadurai, a climate risk specialist for the World Resources Institute, whose family weathered  the flood in Chennai. \u201cIt is right there in front of them. You experience it, you believe it. It\u2019s not something happening far away that you read about in the newspaper.\u201d\nAshok Lavasa, secretary of India\u2019s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, said negotiators were aware of the impact climate change is having on the country, which has more than 4,000 miles of coastline and 1,200 islands. But India takes the view that developed countries, like the United States, are responsible for the problem, and must take the biggest steps on a solution, a notion enshrined in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Mr. Lavasa would like to see that legal divide continue, even though developing economies are expected to become the largest greenhouse gas emitters in the 21st century.\n\u201cWhen you talk about historic obligations, we are not reinterpreting those agreements,\u201d Mr. Lavasa said.\nFour thousand miles from the Paris talks, a familiar smog has settled over India\u2019s large cities, reducing the midday sun to a pale, blurry wafer. The pollution, a dangerous mix of suspended particles from kerosene stoves, vehicles, diesel generators and burning crops, trash and firewood, is at the same high level as November of last year. But awareness has soared, said Joshua S. Apte, an assistant professor of environmental engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, who has studied Delhi\u2019s air pollution since 2007.\nTake the case of Manisha Pathak, 44. Ms. Pathak, who has lived in Delhi for two decades, left home with her children Sunday night, on a short walk to get ice cream. Her father now informs her every morning of the neighborhood\u2019s concentrations of PM 2.5, particulate matter that is considered the most dangerous because it penetrates deep into the lungs, contributing to heart attacks and strokes.\nAverage concentrations near her house last month were 331 micrograms per cubic meter; 10 is the level considered safe by the World Health Organization. Ms. Pathak\u2019s father has abandoned his morning walk; her brother-in-law, who has asthma, is exploring a transfer out of New Delhi. And on Sunday, Ms. Pathak was seized with anxiety over whether it was safe to be outside. She told her children to walk faster.\n\u201cIt was horrible the moment we got onto the main road,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can feel that whatever you are inhaling, it is not air. It is something you should not inhale.\u201d\nSimilar fears are radiating through middle- and working-class neighborhoods of Delhi and Mumbai. Dr. Vivek Goswami, a consulting pediatrician at Fortis Hospital in Delhi, said asthma diagnoses in children had jumped by 20 percent over the same period last year.\nMs. Pathak said she now believed limiting emissions should be a priority for the government. \u201cIt is needed and required,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cThis is a basic thing that a man needs.\u201d\nThough global warming and air pollution have distinct causes, the issues overlap in the minds of many young urban Indians \u2014 a group far more likely to support limiting greenhouse gases, the Pew Research Center found in a survey conducted ahead of the climate talks. The survey also found that 76 percent of Indians consider climate change \u201ca very serious problem,\u201d compared with 45 percent of Americans and 18 percent of Chinese.\nSome climate experts are reminded of the pollution protests that broke out in Chinese cities last year, prompting the Chinese premier to declare a \u201cwar on pollution.\u201d \n\u201cThe media, in a way that couldn\u2019t happen in Beijing, has made this such an issue that policy makers can\u2019t be seen to be avoiding it,\u201d Mr. Apte said.\nFor farmers and fishermen, the changes associated with a warming climate have emerged gradually.\nVinay D. Deshmukh, a fisheries scientist who headed a marine research center in Mumbai, recalled his puzzlement around seven years ago, when he first saw boats coming back loaded with oil sardines, a fish whose northernmost range traditionally ended 400 miles to the south. The fish, he said, were \u201cemaciated,\u201d with bulbous heads and little flesh. His hypothesis: The sardines, \u201crunning away from the hot water to survive,\u201d had wandered so far that they no longer had a familiar stock of phytoplankton.\nSince then, the oil sardines have expanded their range 900 miles, turning up in the nets of fishermen as far north as Bangladesh. Mumbaikars showed so little interest in eating sardines that they are now ground up as a supplement for animal feed.\nChabi Gayakard, scanning the crowd for paying customers at Sassoon Docks, shook her head disapprovingly when asked about the sardines. \u201cThe hotter it gets, the more they come,\u201d she said. \u201cUpper-class people don\u2019t eat them.\u201d \nA friend, standing over a dead shark, suggested that God had sent waves of heat as a punishment, after \u201cwatching how we humans behave.\u201d\nA thousand miles north of Mumbai, the apple farmers of Himachal Pradesh, in the foothills of the Himalayas, are following the Paris talks raptly.\nAs children, they waded through heavy snowfall in their orchards by mid-December, but now the cold temperatures necessary for apple farming come a month and a half later, and some farmers have moved orchards as much as 2,000 feet higher, where the temperature is cooler.\nOver the last seven years, virtually all the apple farmers have come to believe that global warming is a major factor in the decline of crops, said Ravinder Chauhan, president of the Apple Growers Association of India.\n\u201cMy worst anxiety is that the process of global warming may be irreversible,\u201d he said. Every day, since the beginning of the Paris talks, Mr. Chauhan has scanned the newspapers for reports of progress. At other times, he scans the sky for signs of the snow that once fell in December.\n\u201cAt the moment, we don\u2019t see anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are waiting.\u201d",

    "text": "How to Save a Sinking Coast? Katrina Created a Laboratory\n2015-08-08T03:27:32.000Z\nNEW ORLEANS \u2014 Ten years ago, the neighborhood hard by the 17th Street canal in this city was water-blasted. The surges from Hurricane Katrina swept into the canal, broke through its flood walls and forced homes off their foundations. Much of New Orleans remained steeped in brackish filth for weeks until the sodden city could be drained.\nIn the aftermath, Congress approved $14 billion for a 350-mile ring of protection around the city with bigger and stronger levees, gigantic gates that can be closed against storms, and a spectacular two-mile \u201cGreat Wall of Lake Borgne\u201d that can seal off the canal that devastated the city\u2019s Lower Ninth Ward when its flood walls fail. More work is underway, including pump stations that will keep the city\u2019s three main drainage canals from being overwhelmed again during storms.\nThe elaborate system of walls, pumps and gates is still not everything the Crescent City needs; some flooding of streets in heavy storms will always be a fact of life. But it goes a long way to fulfilling a promise by federal and state officials that the kind of widespread destruction from Hurricane Katrina, one of the worst disasters in United States history, will not happen again.\nAnd it is only the start. As the federal government built a protective ring around New Orleans, state officials devised a plan to take care of other vulnerable areas in the state as part of a 50-year, $50 billion master plan. It combines structures such as levees with \u201cgreen infrastructure,\u201d like restored wetlands and bulked-up barrier islands to soften the punch of storms while providing havens for wildlife.\nThe lessons from Hurricane Katrina, laid out in concrete, steel, earth, marsh, and in the ambitious master plan, are being watched with interest from New York to Florida and the Texas Coast. People within sight of any coast want a wall to call their own.\nTo the northeast, New York and New Jersey are looking at multibillion-dollar proposals to limit the damage that could be caused by the next Hurricane Sandy. To the west, Galveston, Tex., wants an \u201cIke Dike,\u201d a great wall to blunt storms like Hurricane Ike in 2008.\nOfficials also have come from around the world by the planeload to see what is rising here.\nRicky Boyett, a spokesman for the New Orleans district for the Army Corps of Engineers, said that in 2010, during the corps\u2019 construction boom on the system, he and his colleagues conducted more than 400 tours for congressional delegations and officials from two dozen nations, including Bangladesh, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands, not to mention visiting conventioneers. After that, he said, \u201cwe quit counting.\u201d\nRen\u00e9 Poch\u00e9, another corps spokesman, said that he had led so many tours that he sometimes felt like a guide at Disneyland. \u201cI have the pith hat,\u201d he joked. \u201cI have my little jungle vest.\u201d\nThe tour buses would take visitors to see such engineering feats as the Lake Borgne wall and the gargantuan pump station and gates at the Harvey Canal on the West Bank, and end up at the 17th Street canal \u2014 then, as often as not, they would stop for lunch at Deanie\u2019s Seafood in the nearby Bucktown neighborhood for shrimp, crawfish and spicy boiled potatoes.\nThese visitors see in Louisiana a glimpse of their own future, as climate change brings rising seas and heavy weather to coastal communities. And because Louisiana is dealing with the additional challenge of sinking land, the vanishing boot of the state has become a laboratory with tensions over the cost and pace of the work, and uncomfortable questions about whether the endeavor is an exercise in futility \u2014 for dealing with the effects of a warming world.\n\u201cWe are at the forefront of addressing the issues caused by climate change,\u201d said Chip Kline, the state\u2019s top coastal official.\nRestoring the Wetlands\nIn the last 80 years, the state has lost 1,900 square miles of its coastal wetlands, a land mass roughly the size of Delaware. That has happened in large part because of the levees along the Mississippi, which cut off the Delta from its replenishing sediment, and because oil and gas operations cut in pipelines and channels for navigation that allowed saltwater to creep in and kill off the delicate wetlands.\nThis history of loss has been repeated so often that just about everybody here can recite the statistics by heart.\n\u201cPeople know about the number of football fields we lose every hour,\u201d Mr. Kline said (the answer: one).\nBut the losses have overshadowed the steps being taken to restore the land.\nThe state has more than 150 projects from its master plan underway or complete. More than $11 billion in state and federal funds has been spent on hurricane risk reduction, with more than $2 billion earmarked for ecosystem restoration.\nThe state is building up eroding barrier islands and headlands, restoring their beaches, dunes and marshes. It is bringing land back to wetland areas that had degraded to open water.\nEach project is its own puzzle: The Caminada headland is receiving sand brought in by barge and pipeline from a rich, sandy shoal 30 miles out in the Gulf of Mexico. The headland shields the bustling shipping industry at nearby Port Fourchon and Highway 1, a vital link and hurricane evacuation route for communities like Grand Isle.\nOver at Bayou Dupont, hundreds of acres of land, already sprouting fields of grass, have risen in recent months from open water because of a 13-mile pipeline that carries dredged sand from the bottom of the Mississippi.\nRestoration efforts like these provide protection from the power of hurricanes, said Reggie Dupre, a former state legislator who is the executive director of the Terrebonne Levee & Conservation District.\n\u201cAnything you put between the Gulf of Mexico and where you live takes away some of that energy,\u201d he said.\nDredging can build land quickly, but it is expensive. And because the forces that are eating away at Louisiana are not going away, the work will have to be repeated. State officials say they would like to see a system that replenishes itself, and that will involve reversing, even by a little, one of the greatest engineering accomplishments in American history.\nAfter Congress ordered the Corps of Engineers to wall off the Mississippi after the disastrous floods of 1927, the region became safer to live in. But those levees cut off the supply of sand and silt that built the land and kept it above water. Now Louisiana wants its dirt back, flowing through cuts in the river bank known as diversions.\n\u201cWhen people talk about diversion, they think we\u2019re blowing a hole in the levee,\u201d said David Muth, the head of the Gulf Restoration Program for the National Wildlife Federation.\n\n15 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nDavis Pond, a freshwater diversion 15 miles upriver from New Orleans, built by the Corps and the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, shows what such a project can do. The concrete and steel structure allows water, nutrients and suspended sediment to flow out into nearby marshes and estuaries. Future diversions \u2014 four planned and two under evaluation \u2014 will channel heavier sand to build land more quickly.\nOn a recent fine summer morning, engines at the Davis pond diversion whined to life and opened the gates separating the river from the 9,300-acre pond. Soon, 5,000 cubic feet of water per second coursed through a culvert and into the open water, where dozens of alligators congregated to feast on a breakfast of marine life flowing out of the chute.\nIn the pond, accumulating silt and the flow of freshwater have helped bring back aquatic vegetation and toughened the floating marshes rich in waving grasses and buttonbush, that teem with white ibis, egrets and herons.\nDiversions are controversial with some fishermen and oystermen, who say that sending freshwater into areas like Barataria Bay will disrupt their livelihood. Environmental groups favor diversions,  however, and officials insist that they are the fix for a sinking state.\n\u201cThe Mississippi River is the lifeline for the crisis we face in coastal Louisiana,\u201d Mr. Kline said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just keep throwing money at the problem, dredging and dredging and dredging.\u201d Instead, he added, \u201cwe just let the river do the work.\u201d\nLagging Outside New Orleans\nEven with all that\u2019s been done since Hurricane Katrina to build a protection system around New Orleans, many residents and officials elsewhere in the state worry about the pace of projects that involve the corps.\nMr. Kline praised the corps for the \u201cphenomenal\u201d speed and strength of the work around New Orleans. But, he said, \u201cthe same sense of urgency needs to be taking place elsewhere along coastal Louisiana.\u201d\nThe corps is the essential partner for large-scale projects, but it moves at a frustratingly slow pace, he said, adding: \u201cAt every turn in the game, it\u2019s either study or wait. We don\u2019t have time to study anymore.\u201d\nIn an interview earlier this year, Lt. Gen. Thomas P. Bostick, commanding general of the corps, noted that the agency was often held back by the congressional process of authorization and appropriation, which can lead to conflicting signals of a mandate to act but no money for building.\nWhile the money for New Orleans was given by Washington upfront, Congress normally pays in fits and starts, he said; the delays drive up costs and levels of frustration.\nWithout a tragedy like Hurricane Katrina to push the nation into decisive action, projects can straggle. \u201cSadly, that\u2019s why we do so well with disasters,\u201d he said. \u201cThat becomes the priority.\u201d\nSuch arguments do not appease locals. During a helicopter tour high above the $49 million Bubba Dove floodgate near the town of Dulac, Mr. Dupre, the Terrebonne parish official, pointed out work on the \u201cMorganza-to-the-Gulf\u201c levee system.\nThis was first planned as a nearly 100-mile long, federally funded levee project, but residents tired of waiting as cost estimates for the project escalated into the billions of dollars.\nNow earthen walls are being piled up by excavation equipment across the watery landscape. The wall is not as brawny as the eventual federal system will be, but the state and local authorities have spent $366 million to kick-start interim construction, with money raised in part through taxes that local residents voted to pay.\nWindell Curole, general manager of the South Lafourche Levee District, noted that most of the voters in the area were conservative and Republican, and not generally friendly toward the idea of new taxes.\n\u201cOver here, it\u2019s not a partisan issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of survival.\u201d\nA High, Necessary Cost\nThe $50 billion price tag on the master plan will require many sources of funding. Federal and state appropriations, as well as private funds, will be part of the mix, of course, but the state will also receive at least $6.8 billion from the recently announced $18.7 billion civil settlement over the Deepwater Horizon oil spill between BP, the federal government, five Gulf states and hundreds of local governments.\nThe state is also in line to receive billions in offshore oil revenue through the federal Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act. The $145 million reconstruction of the Caminada headland is coming out of the $2.5 billion in penalties paid by BP and Transocean as part of the criminal settlement in the Deepwater Horizon disaster. A local levee board has sought further funding by suing oil and gas companies over the coastal damage caused by their operations, but state officials oppose the suit.\nState officials express confidence that the $50 billion will come together over time. Mr. Kline refers to the master plan as \u201ca marathon, not a sprint,\u201d and said that his office could manage about a billion dollars a year in projects, with money coming in as the projects move along.\nRestoring the coast will be expensive, but inaction would be even costlier, said Mark S. Davis of Tulane University Law School. He said that the nation paid one way or another, and the more than $100 billion in relief is simply replacing what Hurricane Katrina broke \u2014 \u201cYou didn\u2019t buy a future with that money.\u201d\nYet all that is planned still might not be enough, said Oliver Houck, an environmental law expert at Tulane University Law School. \u201cThere is no one that says that $50 billion is going to get us anything but a hold in the status quo,\u201d he said, adding that moving citizens away from the riskiest areas is essential.\nSuggestions to retreat go against the grain in Louisiana, where people are tied to their home in a visceral way that can seem peculiar to a more rootless nation. But America benefits from this rich coast, local officials argue, producing energy for its homes and industries, as well as seafood for its tables.\nThe fact that the newly built land will subside and erode, and that seas will rise and severe storms will do their worst, is no argument against moving forward, said Garret Graves, a Republican member of Congress from Louisiana who formerly led the coastal authority. \u201cYou don\u2019t not build a road because you\u2019re going to have to maintain it,\u201d he added.\nStanding on the fresh ground in Bayou Dupont, Chuck Perrodin, a spokesman for the coastal authority, took up the question of what will happen when the next hurricane hits. His blunt prediction: \u201cWhat it\u2019s going to do is mess this up.\u201d\nEven so, the ambitious projects, which carry ambitious price tags, are worth it to change the calculus, even a little bit, of what can seem like a Sisyphean task.\n\u201cAs long as we\u2019re taking two or three steps forward for every step back, we will have a net gain,\u201d he said. \u201cIt used to be we\u2019d take one step forward and two steps back. We\u2019re turning that around.\u201d",

    "text": "The Mysteries of Manhattan\u2019s Curry Row\n2015-04-29T11:02:42.000Z\nCurtains of chile-pepper lights that look like Christmas at the bordello, sitar players in every window, seven courses of food for $7.95: I\u2019ve always thought of Curry Row on East Sixth Street as one of the great minor mysteries of New York City. How did a clone colony of Indian restaurants sprout on one random block in the East Village? Is it true that they all share a kitchen? And why are they lit like a rager in the art-school darkroom?\nFifteen years after my first Sixth Street saag paneer, I was finally getting some answers from Shelley Mubdi. \u201cWe weren\u2019t the first to open, but we were the first to open in style,\u201d he said, smiling widely. Mubdi is retired, but in 1984 he got in the curry game, opening the restaurant Gandhi \u2014 a little bigger and brighter than his peers\u2019, he noted proudly \u2014 when there were about 10 restaurants on the block, before they rocketed to 27 in the \u201990s.\nNearly all these Indian restaurants were actually owned by Bangladeshis like Mubdi, in the classic \u201cmy cousin showed me the ropes when I got here\u201d way. The old joke of them all sharing a kitchen was nearly true \u2014 because there were so many personal ties, workers and costs and recipes flowed freely from one to the next.\n\u201cMy cousin brought me to Sixth Street,\u201d Mubdi told me. \u201cThe East Village was just a terrible place in the \u201970s \u2014 drugs, muggers, smelly. He took me to a tiny basement restaurant. The owner was very nice, from my country. We ordered dinner, and it was really no dinner, just a rotten thing. So I asked the owner, \u2018Who eats this?\u2019 And the owner said: \u2018Ah, all the hippies eat here. The business is fantastic!\u2019\u2009\u201d\nHippies! As soon as Mubdi said that word, the mystery cracked open. In 1968, the Beatles were in their sitar phase, the flower children were tripping up and down St. Marks Place and two blocks away, an enterprising Bengali man named Manir Ahmed realized they would pay a dollar for some chicken curry ostensibly from the land of their yogis. (Maybe the drugs explained the lighting.) Ahmed\u2019s restaurant spawned another, then another, then cousins and friends started coming from Bangladesh to get in the mix.\nI asked Mubdi about the oddity of \u201cIndian Row\u201d being mostly free of Indian people, and he laughed again. \u201cWe had to call the restaurants Indian, because nobody knew what Bangladesh was! We named ours Gandhi, because people knew Gandhi from the movies. Our next place was called Passage to India. That was another movie!\u201d\nThe milky northern Indian food these restaurants served wasn\u2019t food the cooks grew up with in Bangladesh. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even know what a tandoor was,\u201d Mubdi said. Chicken tikka masala was just something customers kept asking for, so someone had to figure out how to make it. \u201cEveryone loved chicken tikka masala!\u201d Mubdi exclaimed. And for a while, it really did seem like everyone: hippies, protofoodies, uptowners, downtowners and out-of-towners all flocked to Indian Row.\nThe curry cream eventually curdled, though, as Indian restaurants popped up in other neighborhoods, siphoning away customers. By the late \u201990s, things were desperate, and unsustainable price wars ensued; lunch specials that cost $10 sold for $5. Mubdi sold his places not long after 9/11.\nIt sounded like a heartbreaking end for such a happy entrepreneur, but Mubdi\u2019s wife, Shama, said, winking: \u201cOh, Shelley never worked at the restaurant, not a proper job. We would just go at night to talk to people.\u201d She showed me how to make a chicken korma very different from the one people ate on Sixth Street. I\u2019d known the dish only as a curry on training wheels, fattened up with cream, cashews and raisins.\n\u201cThis is Bangladeshi-style, home-style,\u201d Shama said. She stirred together chicken with pur\u00e9ed aromatics, yogurt, a few sweet spices, and turned on the flame. I was surprised at the technique, or rather, the seeming lack of it, but Shama assured me: \u201cYou always see chicken korma at parties, because it is the easiest good food.\u201d\nI\u2019m guessing this means that all Bangladeshi parties are delicious parties. The chicken\u2019s juices bind with the onion and ginger to make a deeply savory, mellow gravy, with floral cardamom and clove floating through every bite. A last-second flourish of butter-browned onions gives it a dark, subtle sweetness. I wish I could retroactively trade Shama\u2019s home version for every too-sweet, gut-bomb korma I\u2019ve had \u2014 which never really tasted all that different from chicken tikka masala.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Shama explained, \u201cthe restaurants, that\u2019s how they make every dish in minutes \u2014 they just take a scoop of the base, add whatever else. But any good thing, you have to put a lot of effort into it.\u201d\n\u201cExcept for korma?\u201d I asked, smiling.\n\u201cExcept for korma,\u201d she agreed.\nRecipe: Bangladeshi Chicken Korma",

    "text": "Migrants Rescued From the Sea Face Uncertainty in Indonesian Camps\n2015-05-27T14:22:10.000Z\nBAYEUN, Indonesia \u2014 Mohammed Salim sat on a straw mat in an open-air tent, trying to avoid the stifling midday heat.\nThe 23-year-old still appeared to be recovering from dehydration and mild malnutrition. He was among the 433 migrants from Myanmar and Bangladesh who had been aboard a  distressed vessel found by journalists on May 14, adrift in the Andaman Sea near Thailand and Malaysia. They had been on the boat for three months, abandoned by their captain and crew, and were desperate for food and water.\nSince their boat landed on the northern coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra last week, the passengers have lived here, in tents on the grounds of an abandoned paper factory that has become a government migrant camp.\nThey sleep on mats or wooden pallets on the muddy ground, a thin sarong for a blanket, and bathe by collecting buckets of water from a well. In a clinic staffed by volunteer and government doctors and nurses, the ceiling is caving in and some patients lie on the floor with IV drips in their arms.\nMr. Salim dreams of living in \u201ca strong country,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerica, Australia, anywhere.\u201d\nFor the foreseeable future, however, Mr. Salim and the more than 1,800 other migrants who arrived in Indonesia this month are not going anywhere.\nIndonesia\u2019s minister of social affairs, Khofifah Indar Parawansa, whose ministry oversees the camps, said the migrants would remain where they are.\n\u201cIn my opinion, the existing camps now are good enough,\u201d she said in an interview, adding that the shelters provided for Indonesians who were displaced by a volcano eruption in 2014 were similarly spartan. \u201cOf course, this is Indonesian standard.\u201d\nIn addition to the paper factory in the village of Bayeun, just outside the town of Langsa in Aceh Province, the migrants are living in similar conditions in three other camps in Aceh, including warehouses in a small state-owned port that is also near Langsa, and an abandoned beachfront government compound near the town of Lhoksukon, a two-hour drive to the north, where they sleep on concrete floors.\nAid groups are concerned that the conditions are unsanitary, could potentially spread disease and were never intended for long-term habitation.\n\u201cThese are short-term camps,\u201d said Steve Hamilton, deputy chief of mission of the International Organization for Migration in Jakarta. \u201cNone of them are really designed to be lived in. If a storm comes through \u2014 they are not designed for storms.\u201d\nWhile Mr. Hamilton credits the government with finding immediate shelter for the migrants, he and other aid workers said the government needed to quickly come up with a medium-term housing solution like dormitories.\n\u201cThis was never intended to be a longer-term site,\u201d said Thomas Vargas, chief representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital. \u201cIt was an attempt by the government, and with the best of intentions, to provide for everybody when they arrived and meet urgent needs. But I think everyone understands there are some gaps to fill and things to be addressed in terms of taking care of sanitary conditions and taking care of women and children.\u201d\nInternational aid organizations say the migrants need facilities including canteens and schools for hundreds of children.\nLast week, Indonesia and Malaysia agreed to take in as many as 7,000 migrants for up to a year. The Bangladeshis, who are considered economic migrants, are likely to be repatriated, while the Rohingya, who are seeking asylum, may eventually be settled in a third country.\nAbout 25,000 migrants left Myanmar and Bangladesh on rickety smugglers\u2019 boats in the first three months of 2015, according to a United Nations estimate.\nIndonesia and Malaysia, however, did not specify how the migrants would be sheltered.\nBefore this latest wave of migrants, Indonesia already had around 12,000 registered asylum seekers and official refugees, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, most of whom are from South Asia and the Middle East and were trying to resettle in Australia or a Western country. Around 4,800 of them are being held in detention centers across the country, but the rest are either living in private accommodation with financing from international aid groups, or using their own funds.\nMr. Hamilton, of the International Organization for Migration, said the Indonesian government should absorb this most recent wave of Rohingya into its asylum-seeker population rather than leave them in makeshift camps.\nHe said the eventual repatriation of around 800 Bangladeshis could take several months because of the slow process of confirming their citizenship.\nIn addition, he said, the process of finding a third country to accept the approximately 1,000 Rohingya could take far longer than the one-year deadline set by the Indonesian and Malaysian governments.\n\u201cEven if the countries say they want them out in a year, it\u2019s not necessarily a year,\u201d he said.\nHow the migrant groups fare remains to be seen: There have been minor fights between the men from Bangladesh and Myanmar, also known as Burma, who are segregated in each camp, according to aid workers.\nMyanmar and its neighbors see the people of the Rohingya ethnic group and the seaborne trafficking of migrants in the region very differently, complicating the refugees\u2019 plight.\nThe clinics initially treated migrants for exhaustion, dehydration and infections, though aid workers warn that disease could easily sweep through a large population living cheek by jowl in an enclosed area.\nBut given that only days ago they were in danger of drowning at sea or dying of exhaustion, starvation or lack of water, there have been few complaints since the first boat drifted ashore in Aceh on May 10.\nIn fact, migrants said they have been overwhelmed by the welcome they have received from the Indonesians. Local governments, nongovernmental organizations and volunteer groups in Aceh and North Sumatra Provinces mobilized to help the migrant camps, while local communities rallied to donate food, water, clothing, children\u2019s toys and even cash.\nLocal residents have come to the camps to look around, take photos on cellphones with the Rohingya and Bangladeshi and even give them motorcycle rides around the compound, which one aid worker disapprovingly called \u201cmigrant tourism.\u201d\nAt the Kuala Cangkoi migrant camp near Lhoksukon, the Indonesian Red Cross had to lay barbed wire around the medical clinic to keep local residents from milling about. There were also reports of Indonesians stealing donated clothes and food from the camp.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve cut off entry to anyone but the migrants so we can work,\u201d said Chaidir, 37, a member of the humanitarian group Palang Merah Indonesia who, like many Indonesians, goes by one name.\nFor Mr. Salim, the conditions are not a concern, mostly because he is alive.\nAsked about what lies ahead, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t understand the word future. In the future, I wanted to learn computers, but in Burma, all I was thinking about was how long would it be before I\u2019m dead.\u201d",

    "text": "In Sickness and in Wealth\n2015-03-12T11:45:07.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 When she was 5, my cousin Hafsa fell from the roof of our house in Dhanmondi, a residential neighborhood of Dhaka. She had climbed out of a second-floor window and crawled along a ledge until she lost her footing and fell to the driveway below. Distraught, we rushed her to the nearest hospital, a private clinic.\nThe doctor there took one look at her \u2014 unconscious, bleeding from a head wound \u2014 and refused to touch her. \u201cTake her to Medical,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only place they can treat her.\u201d\nThe doctor was referring to the Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, the largest public hospital in the capital. Although most of the children of my mother\u2019s generation had been born there, it was no longer the sort of place people like us went to. It was overcrowded and underfunded, and horror stories of its unsanitary conditions and inadequate facilities abounded.\nStill, with no choice, we took Hafsa to the emergency room. They treated her fractured wrist and diagnosed a concussion. She came home a few weeks later and made a full recovery. And her treatment was almost entirely free.\nSince Hafsa\u2019s accident, 26 years ago, the Medical has remained poor, while a crop of new private hospitals has sprouted up throughout the country. There are now nearly 3,000 registered private hospitals and clinics, and more than 5,000 registered private diagnostic centers \u2014 though they\u2019re beyond the means of most Bangladeshis.\nThey\u2019re also not immune from horror stories. There was a municipal official who alleged he was sent home after 19 days\u2019 treatment and an $18,000 bill, even though doctors had missed that his arm was broken. And then there was a woman who claimed her baby was delivered prematurely so that the hospital could charge for a lengthy stay in the neonatal unit.\nLast week, an image of a medical clinic in India offering a 50 percent discount for Bangladeshi patients popped up in my Twitter feed, together with this comment from a friend I follow: \u201cCorporate hospitals of Kolkata luv bengalis with cash & disease.\u201d Although the crude advertising was new to me, the news that Bangladeshis are filling the clinics of neighboring countries came as no surprise.\nIn the smart neighborhoods of Dhaka, giant billboards promote the services of private hospitals in Delhi and Bangkok. Local brokers will book everything for you, from flights to doctors\u2019 appointments. Heart hospitals, cancer clinics, even air ambulances all clamor for our cash.\nThe health care system in Bangladesh is both improving and troubled. On the credit side, public health initiatives, especially those directed at women, have been highly successful, reducing infant and maternal mortality rates, increasing life expectancy and improving immunization rates. A range of community-based approaches that harness networks of local governments, health centers and nonprofits have brought better, safer basic health care, with enhanced access.\nThese initiatives have put Bangladesh on track to fulfill many of the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations, and have given us bragging rights over our neighbors. Low government spending on health care, and an average of just 7.7 health care professionals for every 10,000 people (well below the World Health Organization target of 23 per 10,000), prompted the medical journal The Lancet to describe Bangladesh\u2019s success as \u201cone of the great mysteries of global health.\u201d\nPart of the answer, however, may be that those who can afford it are paying for care abroad. In 2010, the W.H.O. reported that every year India alone attracts an estimated 50,000 Bangladeshis seeking treatment. Some of these may be people who can\u2019t, in fact, afford the fancy private hospitals of Dhaka, but are willing to spend a considerable portion of their savings on private care abroad. Whether affluent or desperate, all cite the same reason for foreign treatment: They don\u2019t trust the system in Bangladesh.\nThe horror stories, of course, play their part. They always seem to end the same way: Ultimately, the patient\u2019s family has no redress. While the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is supposed to oversee medical standards, journalists and doctors report that no hospital has ever been shut down and no doctor held to account; nor has any medical professional or administrator ever been successfully sued. As in so many areas of life in Bangladesh, there is both an astonishing level of success and an ever-present potential for catastrophe \u2014 with, seemingly, no middle ground.\nThe public health system works for much of the population. Valiant if chronically underfunded, it groans under the pressures of a growing population, but its primary care service is staffed by many heroic doctors. The pharmaceutical industry is competitive, providing the local market with safe, affordable drugs. And then, for the privileged few, there is the private network.\nNeither system comes under the sort of regulatory scrutiny that would give people the assurance they need. This lack of regulation and accountability means that when things go wrong, patients or their families have no leverage to get reform. Meanwhile, the availability of private health care, whether at home or abroad, enables affluent Bangladeshis to ignore the problems of the public sector.\nI confess I\u2019m one who opts out: Twenty-six years ago, when Hafsa had her accident, was the last time I went to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital. If the medical establishment would expel doctors who provide substandard treatment, if it upheld professional standards by backing patients rather than colleagues, and if the government finally created a watchdog, we could begin to build bridges of trust in our health care system.\nThen, perhaps, Bangladeshis might be less tempted to outsource their health care to foreign doctors.\n Tahmima Anam, a writer and anthropologist, is the author of the novel \u201cA Golden Age.\u201d",

    "text": "Germany\u2019s Small Towns Feel the Cost of Europe\u2019s Migrant Crisis\n2015-04-22T18:28:37.000Z\nVORRA, Germany \u2014 Even as European officials struggle with an unrelenting tide of migrants trying to enter the Continent, tranquil villages like this one in a picture-book valley in northern Bavaria are coping with the legions who have already arrived.\nIt is here, as much as on the choppy seas of the Mediterranean, that Europe\u2019s latest migration crisis is playing out.\nWith the federal authorities expecting a flood of newcomers \u2014 an estimated 300,000 will apply for asylum in Germany this year, after 200,000 in 2014 \u2014 places like Vorra, population 1,000, are struggling to make room for those who are already here seeking legal status and integration. Housing has been designated, services have been mandated, and volunteers have offered clothing and services like rides and free language lessons.\nBut along with hospitality, Germans are also showing hostility. In Vorra in December, and in the Saxon town of Tr\u00f6glitz over the Easter weekend, arsonists set fire to renovated shelters just weeks before migrants were to move in. No suspects have been detained in either case.\nAnd some community leaders ready to accept the new arrivals have faced ugly threats and protests from people who fear or loathe outsiders.\nSimilar tensions, and even acts of violence, have emerged elsewhere in Europe \u2014 including in Sweden, where fires and vandalism were reported at mosques \u2014 amid anti-immigrant marches and heightened questions on everything from the worthiness of migrants to the soundness of immigration policies. The issue is feeding into nationalistic sentiments and politics.\nOn Thursday, prompted by the deaths of more than 1,500 people who drowned at sea this year while trying to reach the Continent, European leaders will try to figure out a way to stanch the flow of refugees fleeing the disintegration of Syria and Libya, or from farther places like Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Mali. The meeting is expected to focus on the burdens the influx has placed on Italy, Greece, Spain and other parts of southern Europe.\nBut in a quieter way, northern Europe has also been feeling the strain. On May 8, German leaders will hold their own talks in Berlin to address a growing plea from mayors across the country for money and assistance in carrying out the federal mandate for each of Germany\u2019s 16 states to take their share of migrants, and figure out how to make room for them.\n\u201cWealthy Germany can afford to help,\u201d said Volker Herzog, the mayor of Vorra. The local pastor, the Rev. Bj\u00f6rn Schukat, said that instead, there was a tendency among the authorities higher up the chain to simply announce that, for example, a dozen refugees are arriving \u2014 \u201cand now you get on with it.\u201d\nBehind the worries is a government policy that calls on the 82 million people of Europe\u2019s biggest economy to be generous, particularly in taking in tens of thousands of Syrians. The federal and state authorities apportion the quotas and, increasingly, pay to renovate or rent apartments before sending the people to localities.\nThere is widespread understanding that Germany\u2019s Nazi past and current wealth impose a particular obligation to accommodate those fleeing hardship and war. But the costs are being felt as social workers grapple with overcrowded reception centers and officials scramble to house asylum seekers while applications grind through Germany\u2019s complex bureaucracy.\nThe federal authorities have already loosened employment restrictions to allow new arrivals to work after three months if they can do so without violating varying rules that stipulate states or regions where they can reside.\nAccepting asylum seekers \u201cis a common concern for everyone in Germany,\u201d Horst Seehofer, leader of the Bavarian sister party in Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc, said this month. As governor of Bavaria, with its large rural areas, he emphasized, \u201cwe will not leave the communities alone to cope.\u201d\nBut this region, known as central Franconia, has three social workers for a current allocation of 1,000 migrants. It could use 10, said Pastor Schukat in Vorra.\nIt was only last December that the federal authorities allocated an extra billion euros to the states and smaller communities to care for refugees this year and next. Just three weeks ago, Berlin was rebuffing calls for more. Now, more money is expected to flow from federal coffers after Ms. Merkel gathers with officials and politicians on May 8.\nIn 2014, some 627,000 people applied for asylum in a European Union country, including 203,000 in Germany. That was more than anywhere else in the bloc, but proportionally, Germany ranked No. 8, with 2.5 asylum applicants per 1,000 inhabitants, compared with 8.4 per thousand in Sweden.\nIn a recent German poll, more than half the respondents said they thought there was strong hostility to foreigners in the country.\nThe concern that Germany is inhospitable was also expressed this winter in pro-immigration demonstrations held nationwide to counter swelling anti-immigration marches, above all in Dresden.\nThe arson attacks in Vorra and Tr\u00f6glitz sent a signal that alarmed official Germany, ever conscious of the past.\n\u201cWe should not be surprised that our partners in the world note with great concern when refugee shelters burn in Germany, and that people follow exactly how German society is reacting,\u201d the foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, told Die Welt a week after the attack in Tr\u00f6glitz.\nThere were about 17 times as many refugee deaths from January to April this year as there were during the same period last year.\nBut just as European statements do little for the Italian Coast Guard members recovering bodies in the Mediterranean, pronouncements from Berlin may not help German mayors struggling with the refugee issue.\nWeeks before the arson attack, the mayor of Tr\u00f6glitz, Markus Nierth, quit after far-right marchers opposed to the housing of migrants demonstrated outside his house. At least half a dozen politicians, from big city districts to tiny towns, subsequently told the German news media of right-wing harassment and even death threats.\nIn a telephone interview on Wednesday, Mr. Nierth said he was glad the federal authorities now seemed willing to do more, particularly financially. \u201cIt is really hard to make clear to some people that there is no money for a kindergarten or a swimming pool, but there is money to put up refugees,\u201d he said. If the state or federal government absorbed the cost, hostility to refugees would diminish, he said.\nIn Vorra, Mr. Herzog, 52, a Social Democrat in a largely conservative state, has been mayor since 1996. He has spent his life in this valley and is still rattled by the night of Dec. 12, when his panicked deputy called to report that the new refugee shelter was on fire.\nDaylight revealed the extent of the damage, estimated at \u20ac700,000, and two swastikas daubed in red alongside a slogan, \u201cNo to asylum seekers in Vorra.\u201d\n\u201cI was speechless,\u201d Mr. Herzog said. \u201cWhat was really so bad was that only two weeks earlier, there had been an open day\u201d where everyone \u201cseemed really happy that a bit of life would return\u201d to a long-closed guesthouse that was renovated for about 40 refugees.\n\u201cFrom one night to the next morning,\u201d he sighed, showing a visitor the damage, \u201ceverything was destroyed.\u201d\nVorra is a meticulous place: Lace curtains hang the same length to the millimeter, logs are stacked in orderly piles and the church graveyard is strikingly well maintained. The community is small, and any outsider is instantly recognized as such.\nBut on a recent afternoon, Helga Herbst, 53, and her husband, Peter, 61, were among several residents who said that asylum seekers would be welcome.\n\u201cThere has always been a good deal of contact with nonresidents, and no fear of such contact,\u201d Mr. Herzog said. Despite the swastikas, he was reluctant to attribute the arson attack to rightists. \u201cAnyone can paint a symbol on a wall,\u201d he said.\nRepairs are underway, though it will be fall at the earliest before about 30 refugees can be received.\nPastor Schukat noted that adjoining villages had already absorbed a few dozen refugees, just as villages near Tr\u00f6glitz had.\nAsked whether the higher authorities were leaving small communities to cope as they can, Pastor Schukat was cautious. \u201cYes and no,\u201d he said. \u201cThe great advantage we have is that it really is possible to integrate these people. In a big city, if there are 100 new arrivals, it doesn\u2019t really hit home in a big way. Here, you really notice if you have 30 more people to deal with.\u201d In the best-case scenario, he said, everyone integrates \u201cin a good, lasting and reasonable way.\u201d\nCoping with change brought on by once-remote global crises has encouraged inhabitants to overcome fears of strangers, the pastor insisted. \u201cVorra is an absolutely normal village,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are 100,000 like it in Germany.\u201d",

    "text": "Muslims Flee to Malaysia and Indonesia by the Hundreds\n2015-05-11T15:34:12.000Z\nBANGKOK \u2014 More than 1,000 refugees, including many women and children, came ashore in Malaysia early on Monday in what appears to be a sign of an accelerated exodus from western Myanmar and Bangladesh.\nThe landing of 1,051 people near a hotel beach on the Malaysian resort island of Langkawi on Monday came after 582 arrived Sunday on the Indonesian island of Sumatra.\nThe Malaysian and Indonesian authorities say the refugees are a mix of Bangladeshis and ethnic Rohingya, a persecuted and stateless Muslim ethnic minority that inhabits western Myanmar and eastern Bangladesh.\nThe group that came ashore on Langkawi looked \u201cvery bad,\u201d said Harrith Kam Abdullah, the most senior police officer on the island. He said the refugees would be sent to the Malaysian mainland.\n\u201cThey landed on a tourist beach,\u201d Mr. Harrith said in a telephone interview. The group included 101 women and 52 children, he said.\nPeter Athan, the general manager of the Four Points by Sheraton in Langkawi, said hotels on the island had organized to send food and water for the refugees.\nThe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said in a report released Friday that an estimated 25,000 people fled Myanmar and Bangladesh by boat in the first quarter of this year, twice the number of last year.\nThe exodus has been spurred by the persecution of the Rohingya, who number around one million in Myanmar alone. The government of Myanmar rejects them as citizens, restricts their travel within the country and refuses to call them Rohingya, preferring the term Bengali, which implies that they belong across the border in Bangladesh. Bangladesh also rejects the Rohingya as citizens and has its own refugee camps, both official and unofficial, filled with more than 200,000 Rohingya.\nAttacks on Rohingya villages in 2012 and 2013 by Buddhist mobs in Myanmar forced more than 100,000 Rohingya into refugee camps, where most remain. The violence has abated, but anti-Muslim sentiment remains potent in Myanmar and is linked to a large political movement known as 969 that portrays Muslims as a threat to Buddhism.\nThe Rohingya pay smugglers to take them to Malaysia, which in recent years has turned a blind eye to their clandestine immigration.\n\u201cThis is a ruthless business where smugglers will let them die to set an example for others,\u201d said Jeffrey Labovitz, the head of the Thailand operations of the International Organization for Migration, an intergovernmental organization that is helping the refugees. \u201cThey are subject to extortion, to rape, sometimes to murder.\u201d\nThe smuggling and trafficking were long aided by weak law enforcement in Thailand, a major transit point in Southeast Asia for the Rohingya and other migrants. But Thailand has responded to pressure from Europe and the United States by cracking down on officials suspected of complicity in the human-smuggling business and by raiding remote jungle camps where Rohingya were kept in bamboo cages while their families were extorted for money, Thai officials say.\nOver the past week, the Thai authorities have issued 50 arrest warrants for local officials, politicians, police officers and villagers complicit in the smuggling and trafficking of Rohingya and other migrants. Nearly 70 police officers have been transferred from their posts.\nThe Thai authorities have also unearthed graves containing more than 32 bodies presumed to be migrants who died in captivity or during the journey.\nThe crackdown has pushed the trafficking away from Thailand, according to Chris Lewa, coordinator of the Arakan Project, a human rights group that tracks migration and human trafficking in the Andaman Sea.\n\u201cI think there is a huge amount of people still at sea,\u201d she said in a phone interview late Monday.\nHer organization has been in touch with families of would-be migrants and other sources in Malaysia, Myanmar and Bangladesh. An estimate she made a week ago that 8,000 migrants were currently at sea was most likely too low, she said.\n\u201cI think we will see many more thousands coming ashore in the coming days,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m also concerned that boats might be abandoned by brokers.\u201d\nMr. Labovitz said that if migrants were stuck at sea on overcrowded boats, their health could deteriorate.\u201cThe longer the trip takes, the worse their conditions become,\u201d he said.\nThe International Organization for Migration found that nearly 2 percent of 2,800 refugees from Bangladesh and Myanmar it screened over the past three years had beriberi, a disease almost totally eradicated in the developed world and brought on by severe malnutrition.\nAmong recent arrivals, Mr. Labovitz said, \u201cright now we estimate about half of the people are coming from Myanmar and half from Bangladesh.\u201d\nAlthough many Rohingya have lived in Myanmar for generations and were allowed by the previous military junta in that country to vote in a 2008 referendum and 2010 elections, government officials insist that they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.\nU Zaw Htay, the deputy director general of the Myanmar President\u2019s Office, said in a telephone interview Monday that refugees who landed in Indonesia and Malaysia \u201cmight not be from Myanmar.\u201d\nHe ruled out \u201cinternationalizing\u201d the issue through regional meetings that Thailand has proposed. He rejected the suggestion that Myanmar was happy to see the Rohingya go.\n\u201cThey are not free to go,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the question is whether the boats left from Myanmar waters.\u201d\nU Kyaw Hla Aung, a Rohingya lawyer and community leader in western Myanmar, said people were leaving the refugee camps daily to embark on sea journeys.\n\u201cIt is clear that security forces here are working together with human traffickers,\u201d he said. \u201cIf not, those people couldn\u2019t leave.\u201d",

    "text": "Indonesia and Malaysia Agree to Care for Stranded Migrants\n2015-05-20T10:46:26.000Z\nJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Indonesia and Malaysia agreed on Wednesday to take in thousands of migrants stranded at sea until they can be sent home or resettled in a third country, in the first official action by Southeast Asian nations to try to resolve a crisis well into its second week.\nResponding to international pressure to save the migrants, many of whom have been adrift in rickety boats for weeks with little food or water, the agreement by the foreign ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand was a potential lifesaver even as experts said it offered only a temporary fix to deeper problems.\nIt reverses the previous position of those governments, whose navies had been pushing boatloads of desperate migrants from Bangladesh and Myanmar away from their shores in what international aid groups characterized as a dangerous game of human Ping-Pong.\ntranscript\nPUTRAJAUA, MALAYSIA (MAY 20, 2015) (REUTERS ACCESS ALL)\n(SOUNDBITE) (English) MALAYSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER ANIFAH AMAN SAYING:\n\u201cIndonesian and Malaysia agreed to continue to provide humanitarian assistance to those seven thousand irregular migrants still at sea. We also agreed to offer them temporary shelter provided that the resettlement and repatriation process will be done in one year by the international community.\u201d\n//\n(SOUNDBITE) (English) MALAYSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER ANIFAH AMAN SAYING:\n\u201cThe ministers strongly condemn people smuggling and human trafficking and express their governments\u2019 determination to continue to take the necessary action, individual and collectively, to bring the perpetrators of such heinous crime to justice.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely welcome news,\u201d said Joe Lowry, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration in Bangkok. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do. They should get the helicopters and planes and boats out there to look for these people.\u201d\nBut in a sign of the underlying problems that remained, the migrants\u2019 home countries, Bangladesh and Myanmar, did not participate in the talks in Malaysia that led to the agreement on Wednesday. And Thailand, which has been a way station for the migrants and until recently a haven for traffickers, did not agree to take in any migrants.\nThe agreement came as fishermen on the Indonesian island of Sumatra rescued at least 370 migrants from sinking ships and brought them ashore. Those migrants included passengers from a boat that was spotted by journalists adrift in the Andaman Sea near Thailand and Malaysia last Thursday.\nAn estimated 7,000 to 8,000 migrants are still at sea, many of them abandoned by traffickers after a recent crackdown by Thailand on human smuggling. An additional 3,500 migrants \u2014 mainly Bangladeshis seeking jobs and ethnic Rohingya fleeing persecution in Myanmar \u2014 have landed in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, or have been rescued offshore, since May 10. Many of them are women and young children.\nIn the agreement announced on Wednesday, Indonesia and Malaysia said they would \u201cprovide humanitarian assistance to those 7,000 irregular migrants still at sea.\u201d They also agreed \u201cto offer them temporary shelter provided that the resettlement and repatriation process will be done in one year by the international community.\u201d\nThe statement called on countries to \u201cshare the burden\u201d by providing financial support.\nWhile the details have not been worked out, Mr. Lowry called on regional governments and commercial shipping companies to help pinpoint the locations of migrant boats and provide them directions to landing points in Malaysia and Indonesia, or rescue them if necessary.\nA statement issued by the foreign ministers of Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand on the thousands of migrants from Myanmar and Bangladesh who have been stranded at sea.\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees called the agreement \u201can important initial step\u201d and \u201cvital\u201d for saving lives, but said further action was required to address the root causes of crisis.\nTens of thousands of Rohingya, a stateless Muslim ethnic group that lives primarily in Rakhine State in western Myanmar, have fled the country during the last several years, most going to Malaysia or Bangladesh. The government in Myanmar does not recognize the Rohingya as citizens and has refused to accept any back.\nOfficials from Myanmar did not attend Wednesday\u2019s meeting in Malaysia and had no plans to attend a regional conference in Bangkok on May 29 to discuss the issue, said U Zaw Htay, deputy director general of the office of President Thein Sein of Myanmar.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Myanmar\u2019s Foreign Ministry said the government was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d with the problem and was \u201cmaking serious efforts\u201d to combat trafficking and illegal migration. But officials have made no suggestion of reconsidering their policies toward the country\u2019s one million Rohingya.\nSurin Pitsuwan, a former Thai foreign minister and former secretary general of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, said Myanmar\u2019s cooperation would be essential to finding a more lasting solution to the crisis.\n\u201cMyanmar has to demonstrate to the world that it can resolve its own internal complexities and resolve this citizenship problem\u201d with the Rohingya, he said, as well as the government\u2019s failure to provide them education and health care.\nMyanmar and its neighbors see the people of the Rohingya ethnic group and the seaborne trafficking of migrants in the region very differently, complicating the refugees\u2019 plight.\nWhile the migrants from Myanmar may be allowed to apply for asylum, in Indonesia, Malaysia or perhaps a third country, those from Bangladesh are mainly economic refugees who are likely to be sent home, experts say.\nThey are likely to resist repatriation: Many have made great financial sacrifices to make the voyage and many have relatives working abroad whom they had planned to join.\n\u201cThose who are identified as Bangladeshi nationals, we will bring them back to our country,\u201d said Khandker Mosharraf Hossain, Bangladesh\u2019s minister for expatriates\u2019 welfare and overseas employment. He called the decision by Malaysia and Indonesia to take in migrants \u201ca very good decision because our primary concern was to save their lives.\u201d\nThe military government in Thailand, where the migrant issue has been divisive, was still grappling with its response, including whether to take any migrants.\n\u201cWhether to accept them or not, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cWe are discussing it.\u201d\nHuman Rights Watch described Thailand as \u201cmissing in action.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope that this failure of Thai leadership is temporary, and that Bangkok recognizes that it should urgently revamp its stance and join with Indonesia and Malaysia to save these people on the high seas and provide them with humanitarian shelter and assistance ashore,\u201d said Phil Robertson, the organization\u2019s deputy director for Asia.\nAbout 25,000 migrants left Myanmar and Bangladesh on rickety smugglers\u2019 boats in the first three months of 2015, according to a United Nations estimate.\nOfficials in the Philippines expressed willingness this week to accept migrants, but did not make specific pledges as to how many might be taken in and under what circumstances. They have said that if migrants make it to the shores of the Philippines, they will not be turned away.\nBut the crisis is unfolding more than 1,500 miles away with migrants using flimsy boats, and so far none have come near the Philippines.\nOne issue that was not controversial was human trafficking, which all of the countries involved, including Myanmar, agreed to try to stop.\nThe migrants who have made it to shore in Indonesia told stories of weeks of horror and brutality at the hands of the traffickers, who extorted them for money, provided little food or water and then abandoned them on the open sea to evade a crackdown on smuggling networks by the government of Thailand. There have been reports of passengers dying of starvation and their bodies being tossed overboard.\nDuring their meeting on Wednesday, the three foreign ministers pledged to take necessary action against human traffickers, and they called for an emergency ministerial meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to discuss transnational crime.\nThe migrants saved by fishermen in Indonesia were on several ships rescued separately on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning off Aceh Province, on the northern tip of Sumatra, said Maj. Gen. Fuad Basya, chief spokesman of the Indonesian military.\nHe said they all were taken to a camp in Langsa, in East Aceh District, one of two camps opened in the province last week.\nChris Lewa, coordinator of the Arakan Project, a human rights group that tracks migration in the Andaman Sea, said that one of the ships that had arrived in Aceh had been first discovered last week by journalists off the coast of Thailand.",

Then, she heard a thump.\n\u201cI heard something fall out the window,\u201d she said, \u201clike a book.\u201d\nBut it was not a book. Ms. Ilyayeva, 20, walked into the courtyard of the apartment complex, a four-story brick building in the Richmond Hill neighborhood, and saw that what she had heard was a baby who had plummeted from the top floor and was lying in a pool of blood on the ground.\nEmergency workers arrived at the complex shortly after 4 a.m., found the infant, a boy, unconscious and unresponsive, and declared him dead.\nThe child, who was identified by the police as Rizwan Ahmad, was not yet a month old. His parents were being interviewed on Friday by investigators as the police tried to determine how a child too young to crawl, or even to roll over, had tumbled through the bathroom window of a fourth-floor apartment at 85-55 115th Street.\nThe city medical examiner ruled the death a homicide late Friday, and an autopsy showed that the child had died from blunt impact injuries to his head and torso, a spokeswoman for the office said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s horrible, but it\u2019s going to take some time to put it together,\u201d said a police official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was continuing. \u201cBut the kid didn\u2019t fall himself, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d The official added that at one point, the child\u2019s mother woke up the father and asked where the baby was.\nThe police said the child\u2019s parents, who are from Bangladesh, shared the apartment with relatives who had two children of their own.

    "text": "Indonesia Turns Away a Migrant Ship as the Region Grapples With an Influx\n2015-05-12T11:30:12.000Z\nBANGKOK \u2014 The Indonesian Navy turned back a ship laden with migrants on Tuesday as experts warned that thousands of would-be arrivals from Myanmar and Bangladesh risked being stranded at sea.\nThe wooden ship was carrying thousands of passengers and had run out of fuel, said Maj. Gen. Fuad Basya, a spokesman for the Indonesian military. He said boarding the vessel would have been risky because of the large number of people on board.\n\u201cWe finally decided to give them enough fuel and food so they could get to their destinations, to Malaysia,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should not have entered Indonesian waters without our permission.\u201d\nThe Thai government, which began a crackdown in recent weeks on human trafficking networks, announced on Tuesday that it had convened a meeting with representatives from governments around the region to help with \u201cexchanges of information and intelligence on the current situation on irregular migration by sea.\u201d But the meeting will not take place until the end of May.\nMore than 1,500 migrants have come ashore in Indonesia and Malaysia over the past three days, leaving governments struggling to respond to the wave of refugees fleeing persecution in Myanmar and others leaving Bangladesh for better job prospects in wealthier countries.\nThe crisis has echoes of Europe\u2019s problems curtailing the stream of migrants making the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean from the Middle East and North Africa. Unlike the European Union, countries in Southeast Asia appear to be going it alone in their response to the flotillas of desperate people.\n\u201cThis issue is quite urgent,\u201d said Panitan Wattanayagorn, a government adviser and security expert at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok. \u201cIt\u2019s a very clear humanitarian issue \u2014 you need to rescue these people \u2014 but you have political complications and economic complications.\u201d\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which is preparing to form a regionwide single economic community by the end of the year, \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a proper mechanism and is struggling with this,\u201d Mr. Panitan said.\nAs a measure of the minimal regional cooperation, one of the leading sources of information on the Asian exodus is a Belgian woman, Chris Lewa, who tracks migration in the Andaman Sea. Ms. Lewa estimates that 6,000 to 20,000 migrants are still at sea. She was following the fate of one particular boat believed to be anchored somewhere off the coast of southern Thailand or the northern Malaysian peninsula.\nPassengers on the boat have communicated with Ms. Lewa using a Thai mobile phone. The captain and crew fled on Sunday, and the 350 passengers, including 50 women and 84 children, ran out of food three days ago, the passengers told her. \u201cThey can see land on the horizon,\u201d she said.\nShe asked a journalist to contact the Malaysian authorities to help find the abandoned boat. \u201cYou can\u2019t just let these people die at sea,\u201d she said.\nThe interception of boats in territorial waters is a gray area of international law, according to the United Nations. \u201cAn internationally accepted definition of interception does not exist,\u201d says a document from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees. The agency asks governments not to return refugees to countries where they are at risk of persecution. The issue is clouded by the question of whether boat people are economic migrants or political refugees.\nThe migrants from Myanmar are mostly members of the Rohingya ethnic group, Muslims who have been persecuted by the government and by radical Buddhists in western Myanmar.\nMore than 1,000 migrants came ashore on the Malaysian resort island of Langkawi on Monday. An additional 582 landed Sunday near Lhokseumawe, Indonesia, on the island of Sumatra.\nIn 2002, dozens of governments and United Nations agencies established the Bali Process  on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime. The organization\u2019s mission is to \u201creduce irregular migration in the Asia and Pacific region,\u201d according to its website.\nYet despite an estimated 25,000 migrants in desperate conditions boarding boats this year from Myanmar and Bangladesh, there has been little evidence of regional cooperation. No one answered the phone at the Bali Process regional support office in Bangkok on Tuesday.\nMany of the boats were destined for Thailand, a way station for migrants whose final destination is often Malaysia.\nThe Myanmar government has rejected multilateral talks on the issue. Sriprapha Petcharamesree, a former Thai representative to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights, describes continued obstruction by Myanmar at regional meetings. The issue of the Rohingya is proposed but not discussed because Myanmar delegates argue that the Rohingya are not Southeast Asian people and that discussing the matter is interference in Myanmar\u2019s internal affairs.\n\u201cI have been arguing that it doesn\u2019t matter where they are from,\u201d Ms. Sriprapha said. \u201cTo me, as a human rights worker, it doesn\u2019t matter where they are from \u2014 they are now in our territory. They are entitled to our protection.\u201d\nUnlike in Europe, migration issues are often swept under the carpet in Southeast Asia because they are considered too contentious, Ms. Sriprapha said. \n\u201cThe difference is that they can discuss it openly, not like us,\u201d she said.\nMalaysia, a Muslim-majority country, has in recent years turned a blind eye to the illegal immigration of the refugees, who are also Muslim.\nThe United Nations refugee agency estimates that 620 people have died at sea during voyages from the Bay of Bengal since October. \nThe deaths were \u201cprimarily as a result of starvation, dehydration and beatings by boat crews,\u201d the agency said in a report released last week. \nThe agency based its findings on interviews with migrants who reached Thailand and Malaysia.\n\u201cA few interviewees also told of entire boats sinking, but there was no way to verify such reports or if, and how many, lives were lost,\u201d the agency said.\nHalf the people who took the journey this year originated from Myanmar, according to United Nations estimates. The other half came from Bangladesh, some of whom also identify as Rohingya and are living in refugee camps on the Bangladeshi side.",

    "text": "Britons Perturbed by a Troubling Shortage of Curry Chefs\n2015-11-04T16:31:45.000Z\nLONDON \u2014 William Makepeace Thackeray, a 19th-century English satirist, was born in Calcutta and once penned an ode to curry. \u201c\u00a0\u2019Tis, when done,\u201d he wrote, \u201ca dish for Emperors to feed upon.\u201d\nCurry today, done well or otherwise, feeds Britons of all stations. (The British use the word \u201ccurry\u201d as a catchall term for all types of Indian food.) Most Britons, at least according to various opinion polls, consider chicken tikka masala, a British colonial adaptation consisting of chunks of chicken drowned in yogurt and a spicy tomato paste, their national dish \u2014 more so than fish and chips with mushy peas.\nCurry is so important to the national palate that it has its own committee in Parliament. Nearly every town has a curry restaurant, known here as a curry house; even the village of Ballater, Scotland, nestled among mountains and with 1,500 residents, has two.\nBut the curry industry has found itself in a pickle: There are not enough curry chefs in Britain.\nThe Conservative government\u2019s restrictions on immigration are causing an acute staff shortage, said Shahanoor Khan, the secretary general of the British Bangladeshi Caterer Association. Already, he said in an interview, a third of the nation\u2019s 12,500 curry houses are facing closing because they cannot find chefs.\nThe first generation of curry chefs who opened restaurants in the 1960s were mostly from East Pakistan, what is now Bangladesh, and are now retiring, but they cannot find cooks to replace them, Mr. Khan said. Younger, better-educated and more assimilated British Asians are reluctant to take on the family business because of the grueling hours and low pay.\nIndian restaurants are changing, too. Customers are increasingly demanding authentic fare that reflects India\u2019s culinary diversity and sophistication, a trend also seen with the rising number of Michelin-starred Indian restaurants. But Indian cooks trained in Britain are few and far between, and chefs say it takes at least seven years to train one properly.\n\u201cBecause of immigration, you have tikka masala,\u201d said Paul Scully, a Conservative lawmaker and chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group of the Curry Catering Industry. Curry proves that immigration is no threat to Britain\u2019s \u201ccohesive society,\u201d he said, criticizing Theresa May, the home secretary, who told the Conservative Party conference last month that migrants were endangering national cohesion.\nJournals, a fixture of the international section, allow correspondents to step back from the news and write about places that intrigue them. We hope you enjoy our choices.\nMohammad Azad, the executive chef at Cafe Saffron in Shrewsbury, said he had tried to hire Europeans. But there were \u201cso many barriers in the kitchen, starting with the language,\u201d he said at a curry chef awards ceremony held in London.\nAt the ceremony, at the elegant Lancaster London hotel overlooking Hyde Park, politicians, entrepreneurs, minor celebrities and curry chefs mingled and watched an incongruous troupe of women clad in aprons dance to Bollywood music, waving ladles in the air as the winners were announced.\n\u201cWhen it gets busy in the kitchen and you start shouting in Bengali, it\u2019s difficult for a Romanian to understand,\u201d Mr. Azad said, raising his voice above the din.\nStaff shortages are common among all types of restaurants, but they are particularly worrisome for those specializing in curry.\nIndian restaurants employ about 100,000 people and generated 4.2 billion British pounds, or about $6.3 billion, in sales last year, accounting for about a fifth of the entire restaurant business, according to data compiled by Karan Bilimoria, a member of Parliament\u2019s curry committee and the creator of Cobra beer. Mr. Bilimoria is also leading efforts to build \u201ccurry colleges\u201d across the country with the aim of expanding the Indian restaurant business, which produces twice as much revenue as Britain\u2019s steel industry.\nPoliticians and entrepreneurs like Mr. Scully and Mr. Bilimoria are urging the government to relax immigration rules. Britain puts a cap on skilled migrants arriving from outside the European Union and requires chefs seeking entry to be paid at least \u00a329,570 a year, which is \u00a35,000 more than the average salary in the industry.\nMost Indian restaurants are small, family-owned businesses, and owners struggle to match the wages that the government demands. New restaurants also usually take 18 months to break even, said Motin Miah, a restaurant owner based in Harpenden, northwest of London.\nAt a debate at the House of Commons two weeks ago, Mr. Scully said the curry industry would benefit from Britain\u2019s leaving the European Union. It would give Britain \u201cmore flexibility to control our borders and tackle some of the unintended consequences of immigration from outside the E.U.,\u201d he said. \u201cThings such as bringing curry chefs over might benefit.\u201d\nThe irony of a crackdown on migrants is not lost on curry chefs, given the history that binds India and Britain. After all, curry came to British shores when merchants in the East India Company returned home with their Indian cooks.\nThe East India trading company controlled vast swaths of land in India for more than a century until it was taken over in the mid-1800s by the British crown, which began its own colonial rule. Merchants directly ruled the eastern territories of Bihar and Bengal, some of which make up present-day Bangladesh. The company had its headquarters in what is now Kolkata, where Thackeray was born.\nCompany officials regarded themselves as the Indian elite, wearing local clothes and even referring to themselves as Indians back in Britain, said Lizzie Collingham, the author of \u201cCurry: A Tale of Cooks and Conquerors.\u201d \nCurry powder was concocted in India to suit the taste of its British overlords, simplifying the dazzling array of regional cuisines.\n\u201cThe British invented the curry powder to put into their English stew,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pastiche of what the British and the Europeans thought of as Indian food,\u201d she added. \u201cIt was like saying all Europeans eat stew.\u201d\nCurry became widespread in Britain in the Victorian era but fell out of favor in the beginning of the 20th century. It was revived in the 1940s, when Sylheti migrants from present-day Bangladesh began working in the catering business after toiling on British ships as boiler stokers. They took over bombed-out fish-and-chip shops and transformed them into curry shops that became popular among inebriated men returning from late-night soccer matches.\nIndian restaurants flourished in the 1960s, when immigrants from the Indian subcontinent were welcomed here. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t really Indian food,\u201d Ms. Collingham said. \u201cThese Indians had learned what the British in India would eat and served it back in Britain.\u201d\nNow, new Indian restaurants are trying to move beyond curry, she said, but tighter rules are choking the culinary exchanges that come with immigration.\nMr. Bilimoria agreed. \u201cShould we expect our curry to be cooked in Delhi and flown over to us?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need chefs right here.\u201d",

    "text": "How I Got Converted to G.M.O. Food\n2015-04-24T10:31:31.000Z\nNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 Mohammed Rahman doesn\u2019t know it yet, but his small farm in central Bangladesh is globally significant. Mr. Rahman, a smallholder farmer in Krishnapur, about 60 miles northwest of the capital, Dhaka, grows eggplant on his meager acre of waterlogged land.\nAs we squatted in the muddy field, examining the lush green foliage and shiny purple fruits, he explained how, for the first time this season, he had been able to stop using pesticides. This was thanks to a new pest-resistant variety of eggplant supplied by the government-run Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute.\nDespite a recent hailstorm, the weather had been kind, and the new crop flourished. Productivity nearly doubled. Mr. Rahman had already harvested the small plot 10 times, he said, and sold the brinjal (eggplant\u2019s name in the region) labeled \u201cinsecticide free\u201d at a small premium in the local market. Now, with increased profits, he looked forward to being able to lift his family further out of poverty. I could see why this was so urgent: Half a dozen shirtless kids gathered around, clamoring for attention. They all looked stunted by malnutrition.\nIn a rational world, Mr. Rahman would be receiving support from all sides. He is improving the environment and tackling poverty. Yet the visit was rushed, and my escorts from the research institute were nervous about permitting me to speak with him at all.\nThe new variety had been subjected to incendiary coverage in the local press, and campaign groups based in Dhaka were suing to have the pest-resistant eggplant banned. Activists had visited some of the fields and tried to pressure the farmers to uproot their crops. Our guides from the institute warned that there was a continuing threat of violence \u2014 and they were clearly keen to leave.\nWhy was there such controversy? Because Mr. Rahman\u2019s pest-resistant eggplant was produced using genetic modification. A gene transferred from a soil bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis (more commonly known by the abbreviation \u201cBt\u201d), produces a protein that kills the Fruit and Shoot Borer, a species of moth whose larvae feed on the eggplant, without the need for pesticide sprays. (The protein is entirely nontoxic to other insects and indeed humans.)\nConventional eggplant farmers in Bangladesh are forced to spray their crops as many as 140 times during the growing season, and pesticide poisoning is a chronic health problem in rural areas. But because Bt brinjal is a hated G.M.O., or genetically modified organism, it is Public Enemy No.1 to environmental groups everywhere.\nThe stakes are especially high because Mr. Rahman is one of only 108 farmers in Bangladesh currently permitted to try out the new variety. Moreover, this is among the first genetically modified food crops to be grown by farmers anywhere in the developing world. Virtually every crop, in every other country, has so far been blocked.\nIn neighboring India, green campaigners managed to secure a nationwide moratorium against the genetically modified eggplant in 2010. In the Philippines, a Greenpeace-led coalition has tied up the variety in litigation for two years. Greenpeace activists took the precaution of wrecking field trials first, by pulling up the plants.\nI, too, was once in that activist camp. A lifelong environmentalist, I opposed genetically modified foods in the past. Fifteen years ago, I even participated in vandalizing field trials in Britain. Then I changed my mind.\nAfter writing two books on the science of climate change, I decided I could no longer continue taking a pro-science position on global warming and an anti-science position on G.M.O.s.\nThere is an equivalent level of scientific consensus on both issues, I realized, that climate change is real and genetically modified foods are safe. I could not defend the expert consensus on one issue while opposing it on the other.\nIn Africa, however, countries have fallen like dominoes to anti-G.M. campaigns. I am writing this at a biotechnology conference in Nairobi, where the government slapped a G.M.O. import ban in 2012 after activists brandished pictures of rats with tumors and claimed that G.M. foods caused cancer.\nThe origin of the scare was a French scientific paper that was later retracted by the journal in which it was originally published because of numerous flaws in methodology. Yet Kenya\u2019s ban remains, creating a food-trade bottleneck that will raise prices, worsening malnutrition and increasing poverty for millions.\nIn Uganda, the valuable banana crop is being devastated by a new disease called bacterial wilt, while the starchy cassava, a subsistence staple, has been hit by two deadly viruses. Biotech scientists have produced resistant varieties of both crops using genetic modification, but anti-G.M.O. groups have successfully prevented the Ugandan Parliament from passing a biosafety law necessary for their release.\nAn eminent Ghanaian scientist whom I met recently had received such a high level of harassment from campaigners that he was considering taking a dossier to the police. Activists in his country have also gone to court to stall progress in biotech development.\nThe environmental movement\u2019s war against genetic engineering has led to a deepening rift with the scientific community. A recent survey by the Pew Research Center and the American Association for the Advancement of Science showed a greater gap between scientists and the public on G.M.O.s than on any other scientific controversy: While 88 percent of association scientists agreed it was safe to eat genetically modified foods, only 37 percent of the public did \u2014 a gap in perceptions of 51 points. (The gap on climate change was 37 points; on childhood vaccinations, 18 points.)\nOn genetic engineering, environmentalists have been markedly more successful than climate change deniers or anti-vaccination campaigners in undermining public understanding of science. The scientific community is losing this battle. If you need visual confirmation of that, try a Google Images search for the term \u201cG.M.O.\u201d Scary pictures proliferate, from an archetypal evil scientist injecting tomatoes with a syringe \u2014 an utterly inaccurate representation of the real process of genetic engineering \u2014 to tumor-riddled rats and ghoulish chimeras like fish-apples.\nIn Europe, leaders in Brussels propose to empower all member states of the European Union to ban genetically modified crops, if they so wish. Hungary has even written anti-G.M.O. ideology into its Constitution. Peru has enacted a 10-year moratorium.\nAs someone who participated in the early anti-G.M.O. movement, I feel I owe a debt to Mr. Rahman and other farmers in developing countries who could benefit from this technology. At Cornell, I am working to amplify the voices of farmers and scientists in a more informed conversation about what biotechnology can bring to food security and environmental protection.\nNo one claims that biotech is a silver bullet. The technology of genetic modification can\u2019t make the rains come on time or ensure that farmers in Africa have stronger land rights. But improved seed genetics can make a contribution in all sorts of ways: It can increase disease resistance and drought tolerance, which are especially important as climate change continues to bite; and it can help tackle hidden malnutritional problems like vitamin A deficiency.\nWe need this technology. We must not let the green movement stand in its way.",

    "text": "Cellphones for Women in Developing Nations Aid Ascent From Poverty\n2015-04-01T14:36:01.000Z\nHere is what life is like for a woman with no bank account in a developing country. She keeps her savings hidden \u2014 in pots, under mattresses, in fields. She constantly worries about thieves. She may even worry about her husband taking cash she has budgeted for their children\u2019s needs. Sending money to a family member in another village is risky and can take days. Obtaining a loan in an emergency is often impossible. \nAn unexpected expense can mean she has to pull a child out of school or sell a cow the family relies on for income. Or, worse, it can mean she must give birth at home without medical assistance because she doesn\u2019t have the money for a ride to a clinic. \nIn ways big and small, life without access to financial services is more difficult, expensive and dangerous. It constrains a woman\u2019s ability to plan for her family\u2019s future. At the community level, it traps households in cycles of poverty. More broadly, it limits the economic growth potential of developing countries. \nSo it is not hard to understand why the spread of new digital financial services to the world\u2019s poorest places has been heralded as a breakthrough with the potential to alter the global economy. Digital financial services offer the world a huge chance to connect more than two billion people to their first bank accounts, lift millions of families out of poverty and accelerate the participation of developing countries in the global marketplace. \nBut this vision of the future won\u2019t materialize on its own. Unless we make a course correction, it won\u2019t materialize at all. For digital financial services to achieve their full impact, we must be deliberate about ensuring that these services are reaching an especially crucial group of economic actors in developing economies: women.\nEven though this technology is spreading rapidly, it is not spreading to women equally. Consider Bangladesh, where four out of five people do not have traditional bank accounts. Thanks to fast-growing digital financial services companies like bKash, mobile money is transforming the way Bangladesh does business. \nYet only 44 percent of Bangladeshi women own mobile phones, compared with 72 percent of Bangladeshi men. And as a result, only 13 percent of Bangladeshi women have used mobile money, compared with 33 percent of Bangladeshi men. \nThis gender gap repeats itself over and over: In low- and middle-income countries, a woman is 21 percent less likely to own a mobile phone than a man. In Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, the gap is even greater. And where there is a gap in access to technology, there is also a gap in the use of financial services.\nEntrepreneurs and venture capitalists try to resist Wall Street\u2019s entreaties, but a new relationship has lead to new fund-raising methods.\nWomen make up half the population. So it is obviously a huge wasted opportunity whenever women are isolated from the economy. However, when women are empowered as economic actors, the benefits touch everyone. Economically empowered women are one of the most important engines of growth in developing countries, and they play a central role in building prosperous communities. \nWomen spend money differently from men. They tend to invest more in the health and well-being of their families \u2014 as much as 10 times more. They give priority to spending on health care, nutritious food and education. A child born in a household where the mother controls the family budget is 20 percent more likely to survive \u2014 and much more likely to thrive. \nWhen women have access to digital financial services, it is easier for them to invest in the future of their families. That benefits everyone, because healthier, more educated children today mean healthier, more prosperous communities tomorrow. \nThe GSMA, an association of mobile operators, estimates that closing the mobile phone gender gap could open a $170 billion market to the mobile industry alone over the next five years. \nSo how do we get more of this technology to more women? One thing we need is more information about why women are less likely to own mobile phones or use mobile money services. \nThis month, the World Bank will release the Global Financial Inclusion Database, or Global Findex, report. This report will provide new insights into women\u2019s use of digital financial services and help improve our understanding of how to close the gaps that remain. The Group of 20 industrial nations are also trying to better understand how digital payments can empower female entrepreneurs and bring more women into the formal economy. \nIn the meantime, governments, nonprofit organizations and the private sector are working together to dismantle the barriers we already know exist \u2014 like committing to digital payroll and social service payments and exploring creative financing options to help make cellphones more affordable for women. \nMobile money companies are also looking for ways to make their services more attractive to women. After a Somali mobile money service called Telesom ZAAD began using female staff members to register female customers, women rose to 24 percent of the company\u2019s customer base from 17 percent in just one year. More creative approaches to closing this gap will help this important technological breakthrough truly break through to everyone. It is here that the technology industry, as well as the global development sector, should look to invest. \nA decade from now, economies in developing countries will be increasingly dependent on digital financial services. Will we limit growth for everyone by leaving the world\u2019s poorest women trapped in a shrinking cash economy? Or will we invest in our future by empowering these women to invest in theirs?",

    "text": "Boat With Hundreds of Migrants From Myanmar Heads Farther Out to Sea\n2015-05-15T11:59:28.000Z\nLIPE ISLAND, Thailand \u2014 A wooden fishing boat carrying hundreds of desperate migrants from Myanmar moved farther out to sea on Friday after the Thai authorities concluded that the passengers wanted to continue their journey, instead of disembarking in Thailand, according to an aid group involved in negotiations over the vessel\u2019s future.\nBut a Thai reporter who witnessed the boat\u2019s departure said that some of those aboard did not appear to want to leave.\nThe vessel, which passengers said had been turned away from Malaysia, is part of a rickety flotilla from Myanmar and Bangladesh carrying thousands of migrants, many of them Rohingya Muslims, fleeing persecution or economic hardship, with no country willing to take them in.\nAnother boat carrying at least 660 migrants landed in Indonesia on Friday morning after being rescued by local fishermen, a United Nations official said. And an Indonesian military spokesman said that the Indonesian Navy had intercepted a third boat carrying hundreds of others in the Strait of Malacca on Friday morning and was preventing it from coming ashore.\nIn an escalating regionwide crisis, an estimated 6,000 to 20,000 people fleeing ethnic persecution in Myanmar and poverty in Bangladesh are said to be on boats in the Andaman Sea and the Strait of Malacca. Some have been abandoned by their traffickers with little food or water.\nIn a statement on Friday, the United Nations\u2019 human rights chief, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, rebuked Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia for turning back the vessels. \u201cI am appalled at reports that Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia have been pushing boats full of vulnerable migrants back out to sea, which will inevitably lead to many avoidable deaths,\u201d he said. \u201cThe focus should be on saving lives, not further endangering them.\u201d\ntranscript\nNA\nMr. al-Hussein also emphasized Myanmar\u2019s responsibility in the unfolding crisis, saying that until its government addressed \u201cthe institutional discrimination against the Rohingya population, including equal access to citizenship, this precarious migration will continue.\u201d\nThe boat left Thailand\u2019s waters Friday after the Thai Navy repaired its engine and provided food, water, batteries and enough fuel for 33 hours of travel, said Lt. Cmdr. Veerapong Nakprasit, the commander of a Thai naval base here.\nThe boat is without qualified crew; the captain and five other crew members abandoned the vessel last week, according to passengers. But Commander Veerapong said the navy had trained the passengers \u201cso they can reach their dream destination. We have verified that they can navigate on their own.\u201d\nAbout 25,000 migrants left Myanmar and Bangladesh on rickety smugglers\u2019 boats in the first three months of 2015, according to a United Nations estimate.\nHe did not specify where the boat was headed. But the governor of Satun Province in Thailand, Dechrat Simsiri, said the passengers wanted to go to Malaysia. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to come to Thailand because we are in the middle of a heavy crackdown on human traffickers and they knew they would be arrested and sent back to Myanmar,\u201d Mr. Simsiri said.\nSeveral passengers also told reporters on Thursday that they had boarded the boat three months ago in the hope of reaching Malaysia. But they said the Malaysian authorities had turned away their boat on Wednesday.\nMalaysia, a predominantly Muslim nation, has quietly admitted tens of thousands of Rohingya. But after more than 1,500 migrants came ashore in Malaysia and Indonesia in the past week, both countries declared their intention to turn away any more boats carrying migrants unless they were in jeopardy.\nIn a statement on Friday, Najib Razak, the prime minister of Malaysia, said his government was \u201ctaking the necessary actions to deal with this humanitarian crisis.\u201d\nJeffrey Labovitz, head of Thailand operations for the International Organization for Migration, an intergovernmental organization that is helping the migrants, said that the Thai government had offered to bring the boat ashore and allow people to disembark. But he said that individuals on the ship who identified themselves as representatives of the passengers told the authorities that they preferred to try again to reach Malaysia.\nThapanee Ietsrichai, a Thai reporter who witnessed the boat\u2019s departure from Thai waters, confirmed that a man who was acting as the leader of the passengers and gave his name as Selim said to Thai sailors that they did not want to come ashore in Thailand and wanted to travel to Malaysia.\nMyanmar and its neighbors see the people of the Rohingya ethnic group and the seaborne trafficking of migrants in the region very differently, complicating the refugees\u2019 plight.\nBut Ms. Thapanee added that women on board were weeping as the boat departed. \u201cThey did not appear to want to leave,\u201d she wrote in an Instagram posting. She said she and the Thai sailors \u201ccould not hold back their tears\u201d as the ship moved farther out to sea.\nThe green and red fishing boat, packed with men, women and children squatting on the deck, flew a tattered black flag on a makeshift bamboo mast with the words, in English, \u201cWe are Myanmar Rohingya.\u201d Passengers said there were 400 migrants aboard the boat.\nChris Lewa, coordinator of the Arakan Project, which monitors trafficking in the Andaman Sea and had been in contact with a passenger on the boat with a mobile phone, said the boat appeared to have taken on the Rohingya passengers around March 1. She said other vessels linked to the traffickers delivered water and food to the boat during the voyage.\nPassengers said that 10 people had died during the journey and that their bodies had been thrown overboard. But Ms. Lewa said passengers have given differing accounts of how many people died during the journey. \u201cIt\u2019s always difficult to get the true story,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are so traumatized.\u201d",

    "text": "In Reversal, Myanmar Agrees to Attend Meeting on Migrant Crisis\n2015-05-21T15:06:55.000Z\nJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 After a flurry of diplomatic activity, the government of Myanmar said on Thursday that it would send representatives to a regional meeting in Bangkok next week aimed at resolving the continuing humanitarian crisis of migrants stranded at sea in Southeast Asia and addressing the larger issue of human trafficking.\nMyanmar, which has previously refused to attend any conference that specifically mentions the plight of ethnic Rohingya migrants fleeing the western part of the country, softened its stance after officials held separate talks on Thursday with the visiting foreign ministers of Malaysia and Indonesia.\nIn addition, Antony J. Blinken, the United States deputy secretary of state, discussed the migrant crisis in a meeting on Thursday with President Thein Sein in Naypyidaw, the country\u2019s capital, said U Zaw Htay, deputy director general of the president\u2019s office.\nOn Wednesday, Malaysia and Indonesia announced that they would temporarily shelter an estimated 7,000 to 8,000 migrants from Myanmar and Bangladesh languishing aboard rickety wooden boats in the Andaman Sea and Strait of Malacca, until they are either resettled in a third country or repatriated within a year.\nTens of thousands of Rohingya, members of a Muslim ethnic group who live primarily in Rakhine State in Myanmar, have fled ethnic violence and persecution there  during the last several years, with most going to Malaysia or Bangladesh.\nThe government in Myanmar, formerly Burma, does not recognize the one million Rohingya inside its borders as citizens, referring to them as \u201cBengalis,\u201d and implying they are from neighboring Bangladesh, and refusing to accept any migrants back.\nThailand, which will host the May 29 meeting, agreed to help address the migrant crisis, which is well into its second week, after talks with Malaysia and Indonesia on Wednesday, but it did not pledge to take in any more migrants.\nAbout 25,000 migrants left Myanmar and Bangladesh on rickety smugglers\u2019 boats in the first three months of 2015, according to a United Nations estimate.\nMr. Htay, of the president\u2019s office, said that Myanmar had agreed to attend the Bangkok meeting only after being assured that the term \u201cRohingya\u201d would not be used.\n\u201cThe term \u2018irregular migrant\u2019 will be used instead,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t pressure us. We won\u2019t accept any pressure. We need the right approach to resolve the problem.\u201d\nArrmanatha Nasir, a spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Myanmar had also confirmed its willingness to support regional efforts to resolve the migrant issue, including tightening its borders \u201cso there\u2019s no outflux of migrants.\u201d\nMr. Nasir also said that Myanmar would send officials to the Indonesian island of Sumatra to verify the identities of Rohingya currently being cared for in four migrant camps there.\nU Yan Myo Thein, a Burmese political commentator, said the country\u2019s pledge to attend the meeting next week was particularly significant given that in the past, its military government refused to cooperate with its neighbors on the Rohingya migrant issue, most notably at a summit meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Thailand in 2009 during a separate migrant crisis.\n\u201cIt is time Myanmar accepts this problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t reject cooperation with the international community.\u201d\nThe United States has offered to help finance international humanitarian aid efforts already underway for an estimated 3,500 migrants who have reached Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, as well as those still out at sea. Washington has indicated that it would be willing to permanently take in some of the Rohingya migrants, in addition to helping others resettle in a third country.\nThere was also a report in The Dhaka Tribune, in the Bangladeshi capital, that the small West African nation of Gambia, which is predominantly Muslim, has offered to take in all the Rohingya migrants, with international assistance.\nWhile the Rohingya at the center of the current migrant crisis are likely to receive official United Nations refugee status, the Bangladeshis are considered economic migrants and will be repatriated, according to officials from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the International Organization for Migration.\nMyanmar and its neighbors see the people of the Rohingya ethnic group and the seaborne trafficking of migrants in the region very differently, complicating the refugees\u2019 plight.\nAfter two consecutive days of ships packed with migrants landing or being rescued off the coast of Sumatra, no boats were reported to have landed or been rescued at sea in Southeast Asia as of Thursday night. However, The Associated Press reported that Malaysia had said that four of its navy ships were actively searching for stranded vessels.\nMigrants who landed in Indonesia in recent days have told stories of horror and ill treatment at the hands of their smugglers, who abandoned many of them on the high seas to evade a crackdown on smuggling networks by Thailand. Some have described passengers dying of starvation and their bodies being thrown overboard.\nJoe Lowry, a spokesman in Bangkok for the International Organization for Migration, said aid agencies were increasingly worried about the health of the several thousand migrants still on boats given the condition of those who arrived ashore in Indonesia \u2014 including women and children \u2014 on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\u201cThey were beyond the point of suffering,\u201d he said of the arrivals. \u201cThey are suffering from exhaustion, lack of food, dehydration, psychological devastation, diarrheal diseases, and are badly malnourished.\u201d\nMr. Lowry said he estimated that 40 percent of migrants still at sea were suffering from malnutrition, considering that some had been held on boats by smugglers for up to four months or longer with little food and water.\nFirst Adm. Amarulla Octavian, chief of staff of the Indonesian Navy\u2019s Western Fleet command, said on Thursday that its vessels were patrolling in and around the Strait of Malacca and would help any migrant boats they found in distress, in coordination with the Malaysian and Thai navies, if needed.\nBefore Wednesday, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand\u2019s navies had pushed back migrant boats from their territorial waters.\nAdmiral Octavian said that Indonesia and Malaysia now had to determine how many migrants each would take in, and suggested that they each accept an equal share.\n\u201cThere must be crucial talks to have a balance between the two countries, based on our territory and responsibilities,\u201d he said.",

    "text": "Migrant Crisis in Southeast Asia Shows Signs of Ebbing\n2015-05-26T12:25:20.000Z\nHONG KONG \u2014 No boats of Southeast Asian migrants have landed since the last one washed ashore in Indonesia a week ago. Search and rescue vessels from Malaysia and Indonesia have found no more migrants at sea. Some refugees appear to be returning to Myanmar.\nAnd American reconnaissance flights over the Andaman Sea the last two days spotted just one boat with about 11 people visible on the main deck.\nWhile no one is willing to say definitively that there are no more boats out there, or to rule out a future exodus, the evidence suggests that the worst of the migration crisis that swept across Southeast Asia this month may have passed.\nJust two weeks ago, thousands of migrants from Bangladesh and Myanmar, abandoned by smugglers and turned away by several countries, faced the prospect of dying at sea for lack of food and water.\nAid groups estimated that from 6,000 to 20,000 migrants were stranded in the Andaman Sea or the Malacca Strait, trapped in decrepit boats after the Thai authorities closed the deadly jungle camps that smugglers had used to detain the migrants to extract further payments before taking them to Malaysia.\nOne prominent aid worker, Chris Lewa, whose reports first brought international attention to the crisis, now says the number of migrants trapped at sea may have been 7,000 to 8,000, at the low end of her initial estimate.\n\u201cMaybe I was not that far off, and maybe there are no more boats left,\u201d she said this week. \u201cPeople are asking me, how many are left at sea? I have no clue.\u201d\nAbout 3,500 migrants have arrived in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand in recent weeks, the International Organization for Migration says, with the last arriving last Wednesday.\nOf those who did not reach those countries, many migrants from Myanmar \u2014 members of the Rohingya ethnic group who had been fleeing persecution \u2014 may have returned there.\nRohingya in Myanmar have told Ms. Lewa\u2019s group that as many as 2,000 people who had been held in boats off the Myanmar coast have now gone back ashore, paying the smugglers as much as $300 to smuggle them back in so that they could avoid being arrested for illegally re-entering Myanmar.\nThe Myanmar government does not consider them citizens, rendering them effectively stateless.\nOne Rohingya shopkeeper at a camp for displaced people in Sittwe, a coastal city that is the capital of Rakhine State, said he had counted about 50 neighbors returning home from ships in recent days. The shopkeeper, U Maung Maung Tin, said they decided to return after it became clear that their route to Malaysia had been cut off.\nHe said they had to pay the equivalent of $180 to $275 to the smugglers before being allowed to disembark. The smugglers sometimes kept people in boats just offshore for months while they filled their holds with as many people as possible before setting sail some 600 miles across the Andaman Sea to southern Thailand.\nThe Myanmar government seized a boat with 208 people on board last week. Bangladesh has agreed to accept 200 of them, whom the Myanmar government said were Bangladeshis, the Myanmar government reported on Tuesday.\nAbout 25,000 migrants left Myanmar and Bangladesh on rickety smugglers\u2019 boats in the first three months of 2015, according to a United Nations estimate.\nOn Monday, a United States Navy P-8A Poseidon plane spotted one possible migrant boat in good condition with about 11 people visible on deck, a Defense Department official said, declining to give specifics such as the location of the vessel. The aircraft, a modified version of a Boeing 737 jet, flew out of Subang, Malaysia, and had not spotted any migrant boats on an earlier flight on Sunday.\nMs. Lewa said her group had not received word of any departures from Myanmar since the beginning of May.\nIf the estimate of 7,000 to 8,000 was correct, that could still leave 2,000 or more migrants unaccounted for. But officials from the Malaysian and Indonesian offices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees stress that no one knows how many migrants, if any, remain at sea.\n\u201cI\u2019m a bit surprised that those numbers haven\u2019t actually been found,\u201d Richard Towle, the refugee agency\u2019s representative in Malaysia, said in a telephone interview on Monday from Kuala Lumpur. \u201cWe estimate that there are still groups out there, but it\u2019s difficult to hazard any guess on the numbers. That\u2019s longhand for saying we don\u2019t know.\u201d\nThe numbers of migrants reported at sea have always been estimates, but they seem to have taken on a life of their own.\nWhen Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand agreed on May 20 that Indonesia and Malaysia would take in migrants for up to a year, the agreement referred to the \u201c7,000 irregular migrants still at sea.\u201d\nThat figure, however, was not based on intelligence that the three governments had collected.\nIndonesia\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman, speaking by telephone from Jidda, Saudi Arabia, said that the figure was based on news reports.\nMyanmar and its neighbors see the people of the Rohingya ethnic group and the seaborne trafficking of migrants in the region very differently, complicating the refugees\u2019 plight.\nJournalists, in turn, based their reports on estimates from the migrant rights organizations and the governments.\nVice Adm. Jumpol Lumpiganoon of the Thai Navy said he did not know how the governments came up with the 7,000 figure, saying in a telephone interview that he guessed the number came from the United Nations.\nBut the United Nations refugee agency based its estimates for the size of the seaborne migrant population on the May 20 agreement. From that figure of 7,000, it subtracted the number of people who had landed in Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as what it estimated to be about 2,000 people in boats off the Myanmar and Bangladesh coasts, to say that there may be as many as 2,000 people still on the open sea.\nJoe Lowry, the Asia-Pacific spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, said his organization tried to stay close to the estimates given by Ms. Lewa, though his group figured that the actual number who were at sea may have been closer to 8,000.\nEven if the immediate crisis has subsided, the underlying problems that caused it have not. About one million Rohingya still live in Myanmar, where they face discrimination and marginalization. And the smugglers who abandoned their quarry at sea after Thailand cracked down on their operations are likely to return to their trade as long as there is demand, experts say.\nMs. Lewa, a native of Belgium who was speaking by telephone on Monday from the Indonesian province of Aceh, joked that if she had known that the governments would base their estimates on her figures, she might have altered the numbers.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s really based on my figures, then perhaps I should have said a higher number so that both countries would have accepted more refugees from Myanmar,\u201d she said.",

    "text": "Snow Fell, but Food Deliverymen Got the Chicken Curry Through\n2015-01-27T17:12:58.000Z\nMohamed Hosen, ace deliveryman at the Taj Kebab King restaurant in Brooklyn, was ready. Cheeks shedding steam, eyebrows still thawing, he had just come in from a nearby chicken curry run in Williamsburg. Now he was headed out again \u2014 with chicken madras, chicken poori and an order of lemon rice \u2014 on a longer trip to Greenpoint.\nHis vehicle was a rickety Arrow motorbike. The road conditions were nasty to impassable. His compensation was, as always, minimum wage plus tips. But his spirit was unbroken.\n\u201cI am a fighter,\u201d Mr. Hosen said, as he opened his employer\u2019s door and stepped out, bundled in triple layers into the blowing, whitewashed world. \u201cYes, I can do this. Of course I can. It is only Mother Nature.\u201d\nIt was exactly what one did not want to do on Monday night: go out into stormy conditions delivering dinner to less than grateful people inside their warm apartments.\nBut Mr. Hosen, who is 37 and an immigrant from Bangladesh, was merely one of the many \u201cfood heroes\u201d who braved the inclement weather so that the diners of New York could enjoy their favorite dishes during the predicted storm, according to a celebratory statement issued Monday by GrubHub.com, the food delivery site that also owns Seamless.com.\n\u201cWe hope that diners will be patient if their orders take longer than normal to arrive,\u201d the statement said, \u201cand generous and appreciative when tipping their drivers.\u201d\nIn his rubber boots, two hooded sweatshirts, waterproof pants and reflective yellow jacket, Mr. Hosen, a two-year veteran of the Taj Kebab King, spent his evening, herolike indeed, piloting his Arrow through deep icy ruts and treacherous winter drifts. In general, he arrived on time and with the food in his care still warm. And he always took a moment for basic customer service: Outside each apartment that he went to, he politely stamped his feet, clearing them of snow.\ntranscript\nNA\n\u201cDelivery,\u201d he yelled into a buzzer on Lorimer Street, his second run of the night, where he was dropping off a $30 order. The customer let him up. She opened the door and received her bag. She was about to close the door when this reporter asked if she had any words of gratitude.\n\u201cOh right, thanks,\u201d she said. The verbal equivalent of her $4 tip.\nDiscerning people will understand why Mr. Hosen declined to say exactly how much he earned on Monday night, though he did say it was enough to make a living. He boards with a roommate in Ocean Hill, Brooklyn, where his rent is $750 a month. He helps support his wife, Aklima Aktar, and their 9-year-old son, Farhan Ahmed, who live in the Comilla District in Bangladesh.\nAt Williamsburg Pizza, a few blocks away, John Kutinsky, the delivery manager, was also hauling dinners through the neighborhood, though in the luxury of his heated Subaru Outback. Mr. Kutinsky, an owner of the restaurant, had been pressed into service that night after his regular deliveryman, who lives in Bronx, called off and the new guy he had just hired could not be found.\n\u201cIf we had a fleet of Humvees, I\u2019d have four or five guys out there tonight,\u201d he said, adding that, with everybody wanting to stay put, he could \u201ceasily do a couple grand in takeout.\u201d But even though the orders kept coming in, Mr. Kutinsky consulted with his partners and shut down deliveries at shortly after 7 p.m.\nCiting the city\u2019s travel ban and voluntary closings, the website Delivery.com reported that its orders were down almost 30 percent compared with the average Monday night.\nBy mayoral decree, all vehicular deliveries were halted at 11 p.m., when nonofficial cars and trucks were told to leave the roads. This order was, on occasion, followed in the breach. A delivery request made at 11:15 p.m. to a certain Brooklyn diner elicited the response: \u201cYeah, O.K., but it\u2019ll take a while. Our guy ain\u2019t supposed to be out there.\u201d A similar request to a Chinese restaurant on the Upper West Side was received by the staff without the slightest hesitation.\nThen there was Mr. Hosen, who was going to get as many runs in as he could. One of those \u2014 a $34 job of chicken tikka masala and samosa \u2014 took him all the way from his base in Williamsburg to Lafayette Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant.\nBy that point in the evening, the air was bleached with snow, and Mr. Hosen\u2019s tires were kicking up an icy wake of slush. When he reached his destination, his nose was frozen and his lips were set into a kind of Arctic rictus. A passer-by could not believe that he was out in such conditions and said so \u2014 aloud and to no one in particular. Up the stoop he went, handing the bag to his customer. Then coming down, his lips had thawed into a smile.\n\u201cSeven-dollar tip,\u201d he said. \u201cNot bad.\u201d",

    "text": "In Nigeria, Chinese Investment Comes With a Downside\n2015-12-05T19:29:51.000Z\nEmeka Ezelugha was excited to open a computer training center. He could teach his countrymen some skills and earn a living.\nBut soon after the center opened in a rough, two-story concrete building in Lagos, a blaze broke out in the main classroom. The flames incinerated 30 desktop computers, as well as televisions and air-conditioners.\nThe culprit was unmistakable: one of two dozen power strips in the classroom. The faulty equipment was made in China, even though the salesman said it was British.\n\u201cThe guy tried to convince me it was from the U.K. \u2014 I was surprised when it happened,\u201d Mr. Ezelugha said.\nAcross this populous African nation, low-cost Chinese goods are everywhere, evidence of Beijing\u2019s growing dominance in global trade. The trade flow has helped keep life affordable for millions of Nigerian families, at a time when the country is struggling with economic stagnation and plunging prices, as well as the deadly costs of the Boko Haram insurgency.\nBut shoddy or counterfeit products are a national problem in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s largest economy, where impoverished consumers have few alternatives. Some shoddy goods are benign, like the Chinese-made shirts, trousers and dresses with uneven stitching and stray threads that fill street markets. But electrical wiring, outlets and power strips from China, ubiquitous in new homes and offices, are connected to dozens of fires a year in Lagos alone.\nThe relationship between China and Nigeria is a complex web of dependency, one replicated in dozens of developing countries around the world, like Chile, Ethiopia and Indonesia. Such ties are integral to China\u2019s global ambitions. President Xi Jinping of China, who was in Africa this week emphasizing economic diplomacy, just committed $60 billion in development assistance to the Continent.\nBut such efforts also pose new and unpredictable challenges for Beijing. China has lent heavily to commodity-exporting countries, which are now struggling with low commodity prices. At the same time, China\u2019s highly competitive manufacturing sector has devastated many smaller-scale rivals across Africa, Asia and Latin America. Mr. Xi\u2019s pledge in Africa, in part, seemed aimed at quelling criticism over what some see as a lopsided relationship that largely benefits China.\nTo support its swelling trade in Nigeria, China is funneling billions of dollars to build roads, rail lines, airport terminals, power plants and other desperately needed infrastructure. China is the top lender to Nigeria, where political instability and violence have made Western interests skittish.\nNigeria, in turn, has become the biggest overseas customer of Chinese construction companies. It is an important market for Beijing, at a time when China\u2019s own growth is slowing.\nBut China\u2019s extensive reach is now meeting resistance in Nigeria, part of the broader risks for Beijing\u2019s global strategy.\nIn Abuja, the capital, the new government is conducting anticorruption investigations into large Chinese construction contracts signed by the previous leadership. Nigerian state governments are struggling to pay for many of those projects, exposing China to potentially heavy losses.\nIn Kano, angry protesters in the streets blame widespread joblessness on China, which is manufacturing African fabric designs in shimmering hues more cheaply than Nigeria. Employment in Nigeria\u2019s textile and apparel sector has plummeted to 20,000 people, from 600,000 two decades ago.\nIn Lagos, authorities are trying to stamp out subpar Chinese electric goods. Imported power strips and wiring have inadequate copper to handle Nigeria\u2019s 240-volt system, said Wanza Kussiy, the chief safety officer of the Nigerian government\u2019s Standards Organization.\nZhang Sen, the vice secretary general of China\u2019s government-controlled Electronic Product Association, said that the group was reviewing Nigeria\u2019s fires. \u201cWe still need to do some research before we can say the quality of the Chinese products is to blame,\u201d he said.\nNigerian authorities are stymied. Corruption is endemic, making it more difficult to enforce safety standards. And Chinese goods are so dominant that consumer have few other choices.\nIn Lagos, Mr. Ezelugha borrowed heavily to reopen his computer training center after the fire. But the power strips are still made in China. He couldn\u2019t find anything else.\nKano\u2019s cloth industry started in the walled ancient city, a labyrinth of mud brick houses and dirt roads.\nThe city\u2019s blue dye has long been made from the leaves of local indigo plants, which are crushed and mixed with cooking ashes and potassium. Swaths of white cotton fabric are dunked in the dye, which fills six-foot-deep pits lined with animal skins.\nBut employment at the centuries-old dye pits has dropped to 250 people, from nearly 1,500 a decade ago. Chinese companies produce virtually identical patterns of fabrics using synthetic dyes, and their sales now dominate in Kano\u2019s open-air market.\n\u201cThey are learning our arts and taking them to their country and doing them similarly to us, and bringing the goods back to Nigeria and selling them to our people,\u201d said Bala Ibrahim, 45, who has labored in the pits since his early teens. Now he spends whole days idle.\nSuch stories are common across Nigeria\u2019s garment industry. The city\u2019s tanneries, which made Moroccan leather from goatskins for centuries, have laid off most of their staffs. Dozens of modern fabric factories on the outskirts of Kano have closed.\nIn theory, Nigeria should have a manufacturing edge, at least in labor-intensive industries like sewing.\nWith high unemployment in Nigeria, factory owners can easily find workers willing to accept the minimum wage, just $80 a month. By comparison, garment factories in coastal China now pay around $550 a month and still can\u2019t find enough workers.\nDespite the high cost of labor, it remains cheaper and easier to mass-produce garments in China.\nOne obstacle to setting up a large-scale sewing industry like Bangladesh\u2019s is that Nigeria imposes significant tariffs on imported fabric, a legacy of its past as a big producer of hand-woven fabric and as a large grower of cotton. Another challenge is that electricity from Nigeria\u2019s national grid is unreliable. So operations must rely on diesel generators, buying fuel at a cost per kilowatt-hour generated that is six times what garment makers in China pay.\nThe Nigerian government wants to revive manufacturing, particularly given low prices now for its oil exports. Abdulkadir Musa, the recently retired permanent secretary of Nigeria\u2019s ministry of industry, trade and investment, said the government was mulling reductions in tariffs on garment materials that are not produced in Nigeria, possibly including buttons. \u201cWe want to start that all over now that oil is no longer at a high price,\u201d Mr. Musa said, adding that overreliance on oil exports \u201chas been more of a problem for us than a solution.\u201d\nFor now, Nigerians just can\u2019t compete.\nChimezie Cyril Okwuosa scrimped for years to set up his own small garment factory near Lagos in 2005. He had 25 sewing machines, 30 workers and a noisy diesel generator. The factory failed within five years.\n\u201cI was spending so much on diesel that at the end of the day, I had no profit \u2014 and some days, there was no diesel at all, and I could not operate,\u201d Mr. Okwuosa said.\nMr. Okwuosa now runs Greentomato Apparels, a small-scale importer of children\u2019s trousers. He pays $2.50 a pair to a factory in Guangzhou, China, and then only 10 or 12 cents a pair for shipping. He sells the pants for about $3.25 a pair, leaving him a small profit margin.\nThe collapse of manufacturing is more than just a financial issue.\nIt has also fanned worries about the possible spread of Boko Haram, an insurgency condemned for its large-scale abductions and sexual enslavement of women and girls. Boko Haram has drawn young men to its ranks in destitute northeastern Nigeria, the country\u2019s poorest region.\nEmir Muhammadu Sanusi II, the traditional ruler of Kano in northern Nigeria, has seen the devastation up close. Outside his palace, a low maroon building with battlements, is a large burn mark. Late last year, a group linked by the government to Boko Haram set off three bombs in a large crowd and then used automatic weapons to spray bullets at the survivors. As many as 500 people were killed.\n\u201cThe Chinese basically copy every textile product in Nigeria,\u201d Emir Sanusi said. \u201cI worry about what could happen to Kano when we have a large number of youths and large numbers of industries are down.\u201d\nAt a Lagos steelyard of Dorman-Long Engineering, the only activity on a recent afternoon was the welding of an oil storage tank. With the steep drop in world oil prices, longtime customers like Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell are no longer commissioning as many helipads and footbridges for their offshore drilling platforms.\nThe locally owned engineering firm had expected Chinese construction companies operating in Nigeria to help offset the slump. But Chinese construction companies, mostly state-owned, have largely imported their steel girders, reinforcing beams and other materials from home.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t see a lot of local content in what they do,\u201d said Timi Austen-Peters, the company\u2019s chairman.\nInfrastructure financed and built by China was supposed to be the great hope for Nigeria.\nNigeria endured coups and a civil war in the 1960s, then effectively nationalized many foreign-owned companies in the 1970s. Nigeria developed a reputation for breaking or renegotiating contracts, antagonizing many foreign partners.\nThe risks have prompted Western companies to demand very fat profits before putting money into the country \u2014 returns on the order of 25 to 40 percent a year. Their Chinese counterparts have been willing to accept 10 percent or less.\n\u201cUnless the West changes its risk assessment, the Chinese will beat them to the African market,\u201d said Osadebe Osakwe, a former Nigerian banker who is now the managing director of North China Construction Nigeria. The company is a subsidiary of a state-owned enterprise in Beijing. \u201cThe Chinese are trying to prove that they can do what the Western companies can do and they can do it better.\u201d\nChinese companies have piled into the country. Mostly state-owned Chinese construction companies have started $24.6 billion worth of projects since 2005, the highest of anywhere in the world, according to the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington research group.\nChina\u2019s enormous overseas spending has helped it displace the United States and Europe as the leading financial power in large parts of the developing world.\n\u201cAfrica has a real demand for infrastructure and industrial developments \u2014 in those areas, China has strong ability and surplus capacity to invest and build,\u201d China\u2019s prime minister, Li Keqiang, said during a visit to Nigeria last year.\nBut as demand at home falters, Chinese companies have been shipping huge quantities of steel girders, piping and other industrial materials at extremely low prices to emerging markets like Nigeria. So there is little benefit for local players like Dorman-Long Engineering that used to fabricate much of this equipment.\nExecutives at Chinese construction companies say they do buy some local materials. But they add that China\u2019s exports are often more readily available and better made, so they can be quickly and reliably included in complex projects.\nThe new Nigerian government is starting to question whether all the construction projects are in the country\u2019s best interest. Many projects, like new international or refurbished airport terminals in Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt, help the country\u2019s elite but may do less for the poor.\nThe new government is now searching for signs of fraud, corruption or other misconduct in existing contracts. President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria announced on Aug. 10 that his government had already found that hundreds of millions of dollars were mysteriously diverted from one Chinese-backed rail project to other government projects, although it was not immediately clear if corruption was involved.\nThe pride of the previous Nigerian administration, which left office in May, was supposed to be a new passenger train line that links Abuja to Kaduna. With trains traveling at nearly 120 miles per hour, the $874 million line is supposed to cut the three-hour highway trip in half.\nBut the line may not draw many passengers.\nA graceful new train station is a 40-minute drive from downtown, surrounded by cornfields and cow pastures. The extension of the line into downtown Abuja has been severely delayed, and money is running short for its completion. And even though Nigeria desperately needs more freight trains, the rail line with its fragile-looking bridges is too lightly built to support heavily laden cargo cars.\nThe fate of the line \u2014 like dozens of Chinese projects around Nigeria \u2014 is a potential problem for Beijing.\nInfrastructure projects in Nigeria have been fueled by the same manic lending that has also created mountains of debt for China\u2019s economy at home. State-controlled Chinese banks have lent money at rock-bottom interest rates in deeply indebted Nigeria.\nThey have done so based on the assumption that the Chinese government will repay them if Nigeria cannot.\nA little-known Chinese government agency, Sinosure, has guaranteed the loans. Sinosure insured $427 billion worth of Chinese exports and overseas construction projects around the world in 2013, the most recent year available. The Export-Import Bank of the United States, by comparison, issued just $5 billion worth of credit in each of the last two years.\nNigeria is a particularly shaky bet for China. The corruption investigations could prompt the government to cancel contracts outright. Government revenue has dropped by more than half since the fall in world oil prices, so the country may not have the money to make good on the Chinese deals.\nThe riskiest projects of all may be those like the high-speed rail line that are widely viewed as the previous administration\u2019s vanity projects.\nA Chinese construction manager at the new station on Abuja\u2019s outskirts, who identified himself only as Mr. Zhang, said the project would be finished by next March. It was only behind schedule, he added, because of shipping delays.\n\u201cWe\u2019re waiting for materials from China,\u201d Mr. Zhang said, \u201clike toilets.\u201d",

    "text": "Litchi Toxin May Have Caused Mysterious Epidemic in India, Inquiry Finds\n2015-01-30T13:27:23.000Z\nNEW DELHI \u2014 An intensive investigation of a mysterious annual epidemic in northern India in which thousands of young children suffer convulsions, lapse into comas and die has concluded that a toxin found in litchi fruit may be the cause.\n\u201cWe believe it\u2019s likely to be some sort of toxin\u201d that causes a sharp drop in blood sugar levels that then leads to seizures, said Dr. Padmini Srikantiah, one of the authors of a description of the investigation in this week\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, a publication of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States.\nInvestigators are testing a variety of possible poisons as catalysts for the malady, including pesticides and heavy metals. But the region is India\u2019s litchi center, and the epidemic occurs every year just as the fruit ripen. So a toxin found in litchi seeds has become a focus of further testing, Dr. Srikantiah, a senior epidemiologist with the American agency, said on Thursday.\nThe affected children begin arriving every year in mid-May, brought to overburdened hospitals in one of India\u2019s most impoverished areas by panic-stricken mothers who generally report that their young children, healthy just hours before, awoke with a scream in the middle of the night, suffered convulsions and then became unconscious.\nAlthough public health statistics are often unreliable in India, the mysterious illness is believed to afflict tens of thousands of people a year and kill thousands.\nThe first reports of the disease date to 1995, when nearly 1,000 children were sickened and 300 died in the three hospitals in Muzaffarpur in Bihar State. Smaller epidemics have followed almost every year since, and similar outbreaks have been reported in litchi-growing regions of Bangladesh and Vietnam.\nDoctors work to calm the convulsions and keep the stricken children hydrated, but they then have to watch helplessly along with the anguished parents as a third of their young patients die, often within hours. Then, as suddenly as it started, the outbreak stops with the onset of the monsoon rains in July.\nThe newly reported investigation, led by Indian epidemiologists with assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has given doctors another tool by suggesting they quickly assess the children\u2019s blood sugar levels and provide intravenous glucose if levels are too low.\nThe hope is that further testing will definitively reveal whether the litchi toxin is the cause and perhaps help find an antidote. Why the sickened youths\u2019 siblings and immediate neighbors are so rarely affected is still unknown.",

    "text": "Fight Against Tropical Diseases Is Framed as Efficient\n2015-07-27T20:50:49.000Z\nIn the battle for the billions of dollars spent fighting global diseases, doctors who tackle neglected tropical diseases have labeled their struggle a \u201cbest buy.\u201d\nIn a report issued in June, a consortium called Uniting to Combat NTDs argued that every $1 invested in fighting tropical diseases would generate $50 to almost $200 in productivity gains by 2030.\nThe consortium\u2019s targets include sleeping sickness, Guinea worm, Chagas, river blindness, trachoma, elephantiasis, leprosy, leishmaniasis, bilharzia and intestinal worms picked up in food or from the soil.\nNot all of these diseases kill, but all can make victims so sick, weak or crippled that they are unable to work or attend school. So many patients lose so many work and school days, the report\u2019s authors argued, that the total economic burden may be as great as that caused by better-known killers like AIDS and malaria.\nAlso, most of these diseases can be fought relatively cheaply with simple measures like window screens, insecticide spray, water wells, deworming drugs, antibiotics \u2014 even, in the case of trachoma, with soap and water.\nPharmaceutical companies have agreed to donate almost $18 billion worth of drugs to the fight over the next five years, the report said. Health ministers in 26 affected countries \u2014 led by Bangladesh, the Philippines and Honduras \u2014 have agreed to take responsibility for funding all or most of their national campaigns.\nThe campaign still needs $300 million in donations by 2020, partly for research into better diagnostics, but mostly just to get the solutions to the remote villages where most affected people live, the report said.",

    "text": "In Durban, South Africa, 13 Curry Stops in 5 Days\n2015-10-23T11:00:09.000Z\nHow many curry shops is it reasonably possible to eat at in five days? Two? Three, if you\u2019re hungry, ambitious and endowed with a steel-plated stomach?\nWhatever the answer, it should probably be fewer than 13.\nI was somewhere around No. 4 when I sat down for a \u201cbunny chow\u201d in Durban, on South Africa\u2019s east coast. It\u2019s a funny-sounding name for a funny-looking concoction: a loaf of white bread hollowed out to form an edible vessel for a generous helping of curry, typically mutton or bean.\nWhile these days such a zero-waste dish could be hailed as carbon-footprint-friendly and visionary, its genesis was strictly utilitarian. Enterprising merchants from the Gujarati bania caste within South Africa\u2019s Indian community created takeaway counters to serve makeshift lunches to laborers. Bania food became bunny chow, the quintessential Durban Indian fast food. Or at least that\u2019s how one origin story goes.\n\u201cBunny followers are as fanatical as football-club supporters,\u201d said Erica Platter, co-author of \u201cDurban Curry: So Much of Flavour.\u201d \u201cOnce a Manchester supporter, never a Liverpool supporter. It\u2019s the same with bunny dens \u2014 people almost come to blows about which is the best bunny.\u201d\nIf lifelong loyalties must be sworn to your very first team, mine are now pledged to Victory Lounge. This is where the Moodley family has been purveying bunnies since 1946. Not sure how to approach this sloppy undertaking, I dug into my bean bunny with a knife and fork.\n\u201cNo! Absolute shock, horror, that\u2019s how people would react,\u201d Ms. Platter said with a laugh when I recounted my faux pas to her later. \u201cIt\u2019s quite architectural in a way. You go from the top, tear off and dip in, going round and round, gradually getting down to the bottom.\u201d\nPardon my lack of bunny etiquette. It was a muggy 85-degree afternoon, and I must have forgotten my manners somewhere between my masala-omelet breakfast and the masala-steak sandwich I\u2019d snacked on en route to Victory Lounge. And the bunny was just an amuse-bouche to the curry buffet that lay ahead for dinner. The perspiration pooling around the back of my neck was surely pungent with salt, coriander and a dash of red chile, and yet, I persevered.\nMy quest began, as these kinds of culinary follies do, with a craving. Ever since I moved from New York to South Africa, I\u2019ve been amazed by the quality and diversity of food, the mouthwatering result of centuries of intermingling \u2014 albeit not always voluntary \u2014 of Dutch, English, Indians and Malaysians with indigenous populations. And yet something was always amiss in Cape Town\u2019s Indian restaurants, something that I, as a first-generation Indian-American who is just as at home in Hyderabad as Boston, was particularly conscious of.\nIndian food is my comfort food, my panacea for all manner of life\u2019s daily indignities. Some might seek solace after a bad day in their mother\u2019s chicken potpie; I request her khatti dal (lentils). There\u2019s no cold day a steaming plate of kheema (minced beef) and rice can\u2019t warm up, and no \u201cEmpire\u201d marathon a takeout carton of butter chicken and garlic naan can\u2019t enhance. I even named my pint-size red car Mirchi \u2014 chile. In New York, I made regular pilgrimages four blocks from my apartment to Curry Hill, a spice devotee\u2019s Promised Land; but for all of Cape Town\u2019s culinary merits, I\u2019ve struggled to find a go-to joint. It was time to look eastward: to Durban, home to one of the world\u2019s largest Indian communities.\nVictory Lounge is on Dr. Yusuf Dadoo Street, the heart of Durban\u2019s Central Business District, once known as the Casbah. Today, the area simultaneously inhabits two worlds: It could be any city in Africa, or it could be any city in Gujarat. A colossal gilded dome presides over the Juma Masjid mosque, one of the largest in the Southern Hemisphere, and the sidewalks are crowded with vendors hawking fruits, phone covers and hair-braiding services. Justin Bieber tracks blaring from roadside boomboxes mingle with the adhan, or call to prayer.\nFrom Victory Lounge I walked to Victoria Street Market, where numerous spice shops supply the city\u2019s curry houses with their red-hot flavor profiles. A cursory glance at the powdery pyramids made me wonder what havoc mothers-in-law must have wreaked in Durban to earn them such a noxious reputation \u2014 I spied \u201cMother-in-Law Hellfire\u201d and \u201cMother-in-Law Exterminator\u201d among the mounds of crimson and marigold.\nMy own (perfectly pleasant) in-laws served as my entree into this far-flung outpost of the Indian diaspora. Most Indian-American families I know began immigrating to the United States in the 1970s; my husband\u2019s family sailed to Durban from Gujarat nearly a century before that. (Mahatma Gandhi arrived in 1893, and the seeds of his Satyagraha movement were planted in Durban.) Yet despite being so many generations removed, South African Indians have retained much more of the culture than I would have expected \u2014 case in point, the food.\n\u201cWe have apartheid to thank for that,\u201d said Devi Sankaree Govender, an investigative television journalist who collaborated with Ms. Platter on \u201cDurban Curry.\u201d Ms. Govender is a fifth-generation South African Indian, whose ancestors came as indentured laborers on the first ship from India in 1860. \u201cWe only had each other. You didn\u2019t interact with other people.\u201d\nOne of the main Indian areas under apartheid was Chatsworth. It remains predominantly Indian today, and every Saturday people from across Durban converge for the weekly Bangladesh Market. Colorful tents mushroom all over a parking lot, the air is thick with the scent of peppers and incense, and Hindu devotional bhajans lilt through the air as people bargain for eggplant, okra, soap, Bollywood DVDs and vats of achaar (a piquant condiment made of pickled fruits or vegetables). All the essentials for an Indian household.\nThe anti-apartheid activist Zuleikha Mayat is the doyenne of South African Indian cookery. As the head of Durban\u2019s Women\u2019s Cultural Group, she edited the \u201cIndian Delights\u201d cookbook that has taught generations of housewives how to make patta curry and prawn biryani (I received two copies as wedding gifts, including one she signed for me). \u201cIt\u2019s very much like Indian food, but with a South African flavor,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fusion of Indian food with local products.\u201d\nAs you might expect, after a hundred-year sabbatical from the subcontinent, Durban\u2019s Indian food has developed its own distinct patois in the broader Indian culinary vernacular. A Delhiite\u2019s dining experience in Durban might be akin to that of a traveler from Beijing trying General Tso\u2019s chicken, or of someone from Guadalajara dabbling in Tex-Mex \u2014 it\u2019s vaguely familiar to the palate, but something\u2019s definitely changed. Even the pronunciations and spellings have evolved subtly over the decades: biryani became breyani; dal turned into dhall; samosas are now samoosas. Cooks have incorporated local ingredients like samp (pounded corn kernels) and amadumbe (taro), and been daring \u2014 sometimes too daring \u2014 with the heat. The same Indian spices are wielded here, but why does it sometimes feel as if they\u2019re simply upturned without compunction into simmering pots?\nCompared with Indian curries, \u201cit\u2019s hotter and it\u2019s oilier,\u201d Ms. Platter confirmed. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t come with its own oil slick, it\u2019s not a Durban curry.\u201d\nIn the Workshop mall, Oriental Restaurant serves a vermilion chicken curry that tastes about as red as it looks. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to cook a genuine curry, why cook a curry at all?\u201d asked Nelson Nundoo, the manager, with a smile when I ordered an extra water bottle.\nI sat under colorful signs reminiscent of India\u2019s famous truck art while eating chaat and other street-food fare at the kitschy cafe attached to the Spice Emporium, a one-stop shop for everything from cookbooks to spices to tiffins (lunch containers) to home temples. Capsicum Restaurant at the Britannia Hotel is a past-its-heyday icon often lauded for the best bunny in town; I personally found their chicken kebab bunny a touch too fiery to make me trade in my Victory Lounge colors. The oceanfront Seabelle has a distinctly trapped-in-the-1970s air about it, with grungy tiled floors, Christmas lights, a soundtrack that veers from Sonny and Cher\u2019s \u201cI Got You Babe\u201d to Silk\u2019s \u201cFreak Me\u201d without notice, and, for some inexplicable reason, a larger-than-life pirate presiding over the dance floor. But what it lacks in ambience, it makes up for in flavor with its legendary prawn curry.\nAnd no Durban family worth its cumin would dare host a wedding that isn\u2019t catered by Solly Manjra. If an invitation isn\u2019t in the cards, you\u2019re still in luck. Every week after Friday prayers, in a spotless dining hall above the catering operation, hundreds of patrons line up for a generous buffet Mr. Manjra prepares in deghs, massive caldrons balanced over open fires. \u201cWe come here once a month for the buffet,\u201d said a diner, Tony Ferreira. \u201cWe come because it\u2019s one of the best curry houses in town.\u201d\nAt Mali\u2019s Indian Restaurant, I tried a luminous, messy crab curry so intense my fingers burned for hours afterward. \u201cCrab curry is a Durban institution,\u201d my cousin-in-law Imraan Tayob said as I struggled to stanch my running nose. \u201cWe\u2019ve developed our own niche of Indian food here; it\u2019s definitely a hybrid type of cuisine,\u201d he added. \u201cIndian food in the U.S. is more authentic, as most of the families who own the restaurants are first generation. But here it\u2019s adapted \u2014 it\u2019s more bordering on fusion.\u201d\nI encountered examples of this fusion everywhere I went. Durban\u2019s pastel-tinted Art Deco beachfront has something of a low-budget Miami quality to it \u2014 except for the vendors selling fresh pineapple daubed in red chile. On the open-air patio of House of Curries on trendy Florida Road, I tried a chip chow, what I can only describe as Durban\u2019s answer to poutine: French fries doused with beef curry and crowned with melted cheese. And at the hipster-heavy Morning Trade market, I debated between Scotch eggs swaddled in halal chicken tikka and goulash served in hollowed-out brioche buns, a riff on bunny chow. But this isn\u2019t considered cultural appropriation in Durban, where the city\u2019s culinary ethos is laced with Indian masala.\nEven during apartheid, Durban curries held the power to transcend race lines: \u201cI think it\u2019s a triumphant dish, a national treasure,\u201d Ms. Platter said. \u201cIt belonged to all of us. I can\u2019t ever remember not knowing about curry.\u201d She also notes that there\u2019s plenty of crossover with Zulu recipes, like chicken and amadumbe curry.\nAt the grande dame of Durban hotels, the refined colonial-style Oyster Box, a major draw is the popular curry buffet. I was duly warned that some consider it \u201cwit ous\u2019 curry,\u201d or white guys\u2019 curry, catering predominantly to the fragile palates of tourists. Perhaps I should check my own lineage for traces of European ancestry, because I found it delicious. A few days of tongue-torching fare must have rendered me desperate for the more subtle flavors showcased on the genteel patio overlooking the ocean. Afterward, we stopped by Sunrise Chip N Ranch to pick up its famous cheese rotis, wraps stuffed with cheese, fries and gravy. If you think that sounds like classic drunk food, you\u2019re not alone: The only other patrons were a crew of surfer types in the midst of a night out, and I was assured that the lot is perennially packed after midnight.\n\u201cNo one could resist a curry,\u201d Ms. Govender said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the reason it became so much a part and parcel of South African cuisine. It\u2019s bold and in your face, and you\u2019re happy and you\u2019re going to come back for more.\u201d\nI certainly came back for more \u2014 then more, and more, and still some more after that. Durban awakened my taste buds to how a familiar bouquet of spices can still invoke new tastes. But even a die-hard masala fanatic like myself has her limits: On my final night in the city, after 13 curry stops in five days, I treated myself to a nice, bland pasta.\nVictory Lounge, 187 Dr. Yusuf Dadoo Street.\nVictoria Street Market, 151/155 Victoria Street (corner of Queen and Victoria Streets); indianmarket.co.za/jhi.\nBangladesh Market, Business Square, Chatsworth.\nOriental Restaurant, The Workshop, 99 Samora Machel Street.\nSpice Emporium, 31 Monty Naicker Road; www.spiceemporium.co.za.\nCapsicum Restaurant, Britannia Hotel, 1299 Umgeni Road; hotelbrits.co.za.\nSeabelle Restaurant,62 South Beach Road, Desainagar, Tongaat; seabelle.co.za.\nSolly Manjra,9 Lakedale Road, Sea Cow Lake; sollymanjra.co.za\nMali\u2019s Indian Restaurant, 77 Smiso Nkwanyana Road; facebook.com/malisindian.\nHouse of Curries, 275 Florida Road; facebook.com/HOCflorida\nThe Morning Trade, 5 Station Drive, the Plant; facebook.com/themorningtrade\nOyster Box Hotel, 2 Lighthouse Road, Umhlanga; oysterboxhotel.com.\nSunrise Chip N Ranch, 89 Sparks Road, Overport.\nThe Concierge is a stylish boutique hotel with 12 rooms; it also has the popular Freedom Caf\u00e9, set in a shipping container; 36-42 St Mary\u2019s Avenue, Greyville; the-concierge.co.za.",

    "text": "The Heart Disease Conundrum\n2015-11-28T20:00:06.000Z\nSOUTH ASIANS today account for more than half of the world\u2019s cardiac patients. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, and rates have risen over the past several decades. South Asian immigrants to the United States, like me, develop earlier and more malignant heart disease and have higher death rates than any other major ethnic group in this country.\nThe reasons for this have not been determined. Traditional cardiac risk models, developed by studying mostly white Americans, don\u2019t fully apply to ethnic communities. This is a knowledge gap that must be filled in the coming years. Fortunately, there is a model for doing so: research performed in a small town in Massachusetts over the past seven decades. Known as the Framingham Heart Study, it is perhaps the most influential investigation in the history of modern medicine.\nThe Framingham Heart Study is a big reason we have achieved a relatively mature understanding of heart disease in the United States \u2014 at least for a large segment of our population. It established the traditional risk factors, such as high blood pressure, diabetes and cigarette smoking, for coronary heart disease. Framingham also spearheaded the study of chronic noninfectious diseases in this country, and indeed introduced many doctors to the very idea of preventive medicine.\nThe impetus for Framingham was clear. In the 1940s, cardiovascular disease was the main cause of mortality in the United States, accounting for nearly half of all deaths. Knowledge of coronary risk factors was spare. As Dr. Thomas Wang and colleagues wrote in the journal Lancet last year, \u201cPrevention and treatment were so poorly understood that most Americans accepted early death from heart disease as unavoidable.\u201d\nOne victim of this ignorance was President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. When Roosevelt began his second term in 1937, his blood pressure was already high: 170/100. When the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, records show it was 190/105. By the time American soldiers landed in Normandy, in June 1944, his blood pressure was 226/118, life-threateningly high. But Roosevelt\u2019s personal physician insisted that the president\u2019s problems were \u201cno more than normal for a man of his age.\u201d Unfortunately, Roosevelt\u2019s blood pressure remained mortally high until he died on April 12, 1945, at the age of 63, from a stroke and brain hemorrhage.\nRoosevelt\u2019s death spurred passage of the National Heart Act, in 1948, which promoted research into the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. One of the first grants was for an epidemiological study of heart disease in Framingham. A solidly middle-class industrial town with a predominantly white population of Western European descent, it was believed to be representative of the United States at that time.\nA key goal of the Framingham study was to establish risk factors for coronary heart disease. The initial outlay was modest: about $94,000, mostly to cover office supplies (including ashtrays for the study researchers who smoked). At the time, factors hypothesized to increase coronary risk included \u201cnervous and mental states,\u201d occupation and use of stimulants like Benzedrine.\nAfter about 10 years of close monitoring of approximately 5,000 patients, the Framingham researchers in 1957 published a key paper (out of the nearly 1,200 produced by the study) showing a nearly fourfold increase in the incidence of coronary heart disease in patients with high blood pressure. Later publications found correlations between coronary disease and diabetes, high blood cholesterol levels and cigarette smoking. This information led to lifestyle changes that have undoubtedly saved countless lives.\nHowever, Framingham risk models do not tell the whole story for nonwhite ethnic groups. In 1959, the first study was published showing the increased risk of premature heart disease in Indian immigrant males, who had four times the rate compared with the men in Framingham, despite having lower rates of hypertension, smoking and high cholesterol, and more often following a vegetarian diet.\nWhat is it about South Asian genetics or environments that lead to so much heart disease? We need a Framingham-type study to answer this question.\nFortunately, the National Institutes of Health have started such a study. Named Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America, or Masala, it has enrolled about 900 South Asian men and women in two large metropolitan areas, the San Francisco Bay Area and Chicago. Researchers are focusing on novel risk factors, including malignant forms of cholesterol (previous research has suggested that South Asians may have smaller and denser cholesterol particles that are more prone to causing hardening of the arteries), as well as other social, cultural and genetic determinants.\nProspective results from Masala will be published in the next couple of years. They cannot come soon enough.",

    "text": "Rohingya Women Flee Violence Only to Be Sold Into Marriage\n2015-08-03T00:58:31.000Z\nGELUGOR, Malaysia \u2014 The young woman had been penned in a camp in the sweltering jungle of southern Thailand for two months when she was offered a deal.\nShe fled Myanmar this year hoping to reach safety in Malaysia, after anti-Muslim rioters burned her village. But her family could not afford the $1,260 the smugglers demanded to complete the journey.\nA stranger was willing to pay for her freedom, the smugglers said, if she agreed to marry him. \n\u201cI was allowed to call my parents, and they said that if I was willing, it would be better for all the family,\u201d said the woman, Shahidah Yunus, 22. \u201cI understood what I must do.\u201d\nShe joined the hundreds of young Rohingya women from Myanmar sold into marriage to Rohingya men already in Malaysia as the price of escaping violence and poverty in their homeland.\nWhile some Rohingya women agree to such marriages to escape imprisonment or worse at the hands of smugglers, others are tricked or coerced. Some are only teenagers.\nTheir numbers are difficult to gauge, but officials and activists estimate that in recent years hundreds, if not thousands, of Rohingya women every year have been married off this way, and that their numbers have been increasing.\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported that a surge of maritime migrants from Bangladesh and Myanmar this year brought an increase in \u201cabductions and marriages arranged without the consent of women whose passage was ultimately paid for by prospective husbands.\u201d\n\u201cHundreds, if not thousands, of women and girls have been forced, sold or arranged for marriage via these trafficking corridors since 2012,\u201d said Matthew Smith, the executive director of Fortify Rights, an advocacy group in Bangkok that monitors Rohingya refugees. \u201cFor some families, it\u2019s viewed as an imperative, as a survival mechanism.\u201d\n\u201cThe trafficking gangs are treating this as a rather lucrative business,\u201d he said, adding that for the women and girls, \u201cbeing sold or forced into marriage is the least-worst outcome, and that\u2019s a problem.\u201d\nMs. Yunus, who now shares a house with her 38-year-old husband and 17 other Rohingyas on Penang Island, Malaysia, said she had little choice after an uncle who had promised to pay for her journey failed to do so.\n\u201cI chose to marry my husband because the smugglers needed money to release me,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were afraid of rape. It is better to marry a Rohingya man who can take care of us.\u201d\nSharifah Shakirah, a Rohingya refugee in Kuala Lumpur who advises refugees on resettlement, said that many of the women held by smugglers fear that if they do not find husbands quickly, \u201cthe traffickers might sell them to do sex work\u201d in Thailand or India.\nWhile such trafficking is not unheard-of, it appears to be deployed more commonly as a threat than an eventuality.\nSome women have no say in the matter, according to Mr. Smith of Fortify Rights, which is preparing a report on marriages and human trafficking.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t care about anything,\u201d one 15-year-old girl said of her traffickers, according to notes provided by Mr. Smith. \u201cIf someone pays money, we would have to go to them.\u201d\nThe young women often undertake the journeys under pressure from parents, anxious to send their daughters to safety and to reduce their domestic burdens, and are lured on by smugglers\u2019 rosy promises about the cost of the voyage and the good life that awaits them in Malaysia, Rohingyas and experts said.\nIn reality, single women who board smugglers\u2019 ships without the means to pay become merchandise, held in a camp or aboard a ship until someone pays for their release.\nIf the smugglers know the woman\u2019s family cannot afford the cost, \u201cthey will inform other people and say, \u2018We have this woman,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Shakirah said.\nThe husbands often turn out to be older and poorer than promised. Some women end up trapped in unhappy or abusive relationships.\nTwo years ago, Ambiya Khatu, 21, married a man in Malaysia who paid $1,050 for her release from smugglers in Thailand. \u201cEven though he is too old for me, my mother agreed to the marriage,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was nobody to rescue us, so I agreed.\u201d\nIn Myanmar, formerly Burma, she had hoped to study nursing and work in a hospital. Now she lives in a suburb of Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, caring for her mother, her ill sister and her sister\u2019s baby in a cramped room, while awaiting the return of her husband. He disappeared months ago, saying he was looking for work.\n\u201cAfter being rescued, my husband asked if I wanted to marry him,\u201d Ms. Khatu said, her round, expressive face a palette of conflicted emotions. \u201cHe said, \u2018If you don\u2019t want to marry me, you can simply pay back my money which I spent on you.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nThat was impossible.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the language, so how will I work to pay him?\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, we don\u2019t have any relatives here, and I don\u2019t have any legal documentation, so there was no option for me except marriage.\u201d\nHer mother, Mabiya Khatu, shook her head and murmured in disapproval. Her own husband was killed in 2012, when rioters swept into their village, leaving the family impoverished, she said. The alternative was her daughters being sold into sexual slavery, she said.\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t give my daughter to him, then the traffickers might have sold her into the wrong hands,\u201d the mother said. \u201cTraffickers tried to sell both my daughters, so I got them married, and here she is in safe hands, and able to eat at least.\u201d\nThe younger Ms. Khatu frowned. \u201cI didn\u2019t like him,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I had to like him.\u201d\nRohingya men who paid smugglers for brides were reluctant to discuss how the deals were struck. But a phone call recorded by investigators from Fortify Rights last September between a Rohingya woman held in a camp in Thailand and a Rohingya broker reveals the harsh calculus determining a woman\u2019s fate.\n\u201cYou have never married yet?\u201d the broker asks, according to a transcript provided by Fortify Rights.\n\u201cI have never married,\u201d she says.\nThe broker says that he knows an eligible man, an elderly Rohingya, willing to pay $780 for the rest of her journey to Malaysia.\n\u201cWill you marry?\u201d the broker asks.\n\u201cYes, I will marry, if that is the will of God,\u201d she answers. \u201cWe are in a difficult situation. Would you please try to take us in two or three days? We cannot get food, water, clothes, and cannot take a bath.\u201d\nAfter the deal is made, the broker tells a guard in the camp that he needs several more single women for prospective husbands.\n\u201cYou can see them first,\u201d the guard says. \u201cIf you want to take one or two, that is your decision.\u201d\nThe transactions are not always so clear-cut, however, especially given that Rohingya women come from a culture where arranged marriages are the norm. But in their villages, the women often know the prospective husbands, and they are likely to have more say in the decision.\nIn some cases, impoverished families arrange marriages in advance to pay for a daughter\u2019s trip.\nSome of the women who marry to pay a smuggler\u2019s fare describe it as a choice, but Susan Kneebone, a professorial fellow at the University of Melbourne in Australia who is studying forced migration and marriage in Southeast Asia, says that these marriages amount to trafficking when violence, threats or misleading promises are used.\n\u201cThe idea of trafficking is really one of whether there has been an abuse of power,\u201d she said. \u201cThese women actually don\u2019t have that much freedom within their own community, I suspect, and that\u2019s all made much worse by the fact that they\u2019re traveling to another country.\u201d\nAfter anti-Muslim violence erupted in Western Myanmar in 2012, most of the refugees were men. But the number of women and children fleeing from Myanmar has risen in the past two years.\nOne reason is the scarcity of eligible Rohingya men in Myanmar. The shortage has also raised the cost of dowries paid by the brides\u2019 families, said Chris Lewa, a Rohingya rights advocate based in Bangkok. Conversely, she said, the high ratio of Rohingya men to women in Malaysia made men there more willing to pay for a bride\u2019s journey and to forgo a dowry.\nThis year and last year, she said, \u201cone can safely say that at least 5,000 young women embarked on boats and would have entered in a marriage after arriving in Malaysia.\u201d\nFor now, the smuggling has been paused by a regional crackdown and the rough weather of the monsoon season. But some Rohingya women are waiting for the trade to resume so they too can flee, even if the price of a ticket is marriage.\nTahera Begum, 18, a Rohingya woman who had fled Myanmar a few months earlier, was staying with her sister-in-law in a makeshift camp in Kutupalong, Bangladesh, waiting to continue her journey to marry a man in Malaysia who was chosen by her brother, also in Malaysia.\nShe had not seen a picture of the man, but they had spoken to him on the phone several times.\n\u201cWhen I talked to him, he said he had a job, so he had an income,\u201d she said. \u201cI would have been happier if I could stay here, but my brother wanted me to get married in Malaysia.\n\u201cIf I get the signal from my brother or husband-to-be,\u201d she said, \u201cI will try again.\u201d",

    "text": "Myanmar to Bar Rohingya From Fleeing, but Won\u2019t Address Their Plight\n2015-06-12T08:59:16.000Z\nSITTWE, Myanmar \u2014 The government of Myanmar says it is determined to stop the departures of migrants fleeing religious persecution in places like this bitterly divided port city, but it will not budge in its refusal to address the conditions driving the exodus across the sea.\nTens of thousands of Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic group, fled the country in recent months, setting off a regional crisis when boatloads of migrants were abandoned at sea or abused and held for ransom by traffickers.\nBut the government insists that most of the migrants do not belong in Myanmar, referring to them as Bengalis, and says it has no plans to alter policies that strip them of basic rights and confine more than 140,000 to a crowded, squalid government camp here.\n\u201cThere is no change in the government\u2019s policy toward the Bengalis,\u201d U Zaw Htay, a deputy director general of the Myanmar president\u2019s office, said in an interview this week.\nUnder international pressure, as crowded vessels baked and bobbed in the ocean for days with no country willing to take them in, regional leaders met in Bangkok last month, and the immediate crisis was relieved when the migrants were granted temporary refuge.\nBut any hope that Myanmar might have been persuaded to soften its position was quickly dispelled.\nWhen a government delegation returned from the talks, the state news media hailed the officials as managing \u201cto refute accusations that the boat people were from Myanmar.\u201d\nAnd those people, despite the reports of horror stories at sea, are no less desperate to leave.\n\u201cI can\u2019t stand living here anymore,\u201d said Nur Islam, a fisherman who has languished for two and a half years in the sprawling government encampment. \u201cI have children, and I can\u2019t feed them.\u201d\nTwo of his six children left by boat for Malaysia this year, and although he has not heard from them, he says he is ready to go, too.\ntranscript\nThousands of migrants leaving myanmar have been abandoned, stranded at sea\nThis is where they left from. We\u2019re right on the edge of a refugee camp in Myanmar. It\u2019s a miserable place\n\n\n140,000 Rohingyans live here 15 minutes from Sitwe. \n\nBut recently, almost none have risked the journey and I came here to see why.\n\n(video - talking to the guys on the boats)\n\nOne barrier is the weather.  Its Monsoon season.\n\n\nMr. Issoup, 51 (His full name is only this one name)\n00.16 - 00.23 : The situation hasn\u2019t changed. People here is like living a closed place.\u201d\n00.24 - 00.29 : They have no job and they cannot go to the downtown. People have become upset.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Myanmar government has also bowed to international pressure and is attempting to clamp down on departures.  \n\nSoldiers patrol the camp, and the authorities bar anyone from leaving without permission.\n\nSmugglers had been the ones helping people leave. But recently they\u2019ve faced a backlash.  \nWe learned one of the biggest traffickers lives nearby.\n\n*sequence of them asking about the smuggler\n\nFor many who took the voyage, it was perilous. Zura*** son left for Malaysia 6 months ago. Traffickers asked for a ransom and then left her son for dead, she says\n\n\nBut there are few options for those who o  remain. \nAnd police now say that if anyone attempts to leave, they simply won\u2019t allow it. \n\nMr. Babu Lu, 26 \u201c\n00.00 - 00.03 : We have had no freedom here for 3 years.\n00.03 - 00.08 : There is no jobs and no freedom. \n00.08 - 00.11 : There\u2019s no happiness living here.\n\n\n(re-read as voice over ) - But the conditions in the camp are so terrible. It seems likely that once the monsoon subsides, and once the world is no longer watching, departures will continue.\n\u201cIf I get my hands on any money,\u201d he vowed, \u201cI\u2019m going to Malaysia as soon as possible.\u201d\nIf the exodus has subsided for now, the reasons appear to be temporary.\nIn one concession to international pressure, the Myanmar government said it would monitor boat traffic in an effort to crack down on human trafficking. But given the government\u2019s desire for the Rohingya people to leave, its commitment to policing the beaches here may not last.\nMore to the point, perhaps, the traffickers are lying low after a crackdown on their transit camps in southern Thailand and reports of their abuses have filtered back here. Many of those who left are still unaccounted for.\nLast week a man accused of being a trafficker, U Maung Hla, was beaten by a mob wielding metal rods and axes in a vigilante attack by family members of migrants held for ransom.\nBut perhaps the main reason the migration has slowed is the weather. The arrival of the monsoon season has made seas choppy and dangerous.\nCalmer waters will return in October and November, and the traffickers will return as well, experts say, as long as demand exists.\nSince 2012, when violence erupted between Muslims and Buddhists here and Buddhist mobs set fire to Rohingya homes, the government has herded tens of thousands of Rohingya from Sittwe and other towns and villages into the camp here, an area of only several square miles.\nSome 140,000 Rohingya live here in rows of flimsy bamboo huts without electricity. Raw sewage flows through open concrete drains, children are undernourished, and health care is dispensed by overwhelmed medical personnel who have no facility for treating serious ailments.\nThe Rohingya here are barred from leaving, a rule that applies even to those who have homes just outside camp boundaries. The government has not said when, if ever, they will be allowed to return to their homes.\n\u201cIf they force us to stay here longer, every last person will crawl onto boats if they have to,\u201d said Dil Mohamad, 32, a former grocery shop owner who was forced to flee his home in Sittwe when his Rohingya Muslim neighborhood was burned by Buddhist mobs.\nThe Rohingya who live outside the camps, in countless villages along the border with Bangladesh, describe a different kind of imprisonment. They are closely monitored by the authorities, conscripted into forced labor and barred from travel outside their villages without permission.\nThe Rohingya are denied citizenship, though many say their families have lived in Myanmar since before there was a border between what was then Burma and the rest of Britain\u2019s empire in southern Asia.\nMyanmar and its neighbors see the people of the Rohingya ethnic group and the seaborne trafficking of migrants in the region very differently, complicating the refugees\u2019 plight.\nUntil the government\u2019s official policy of discrimination took hold in the early 1990s and extremist Buddhist teachings espousing hatred of Muslims swept the country, many Rohingya worked for the government as schoolteachers, firefighters and clerks.\n\u201cI\u2019ve told the authorities many times that I am a citizen of this country and that my parents were also citizens,\u201d said Noor Muhammad, 60, a former sergeant in the Myanmar police force who is now interned in the camp. \u201cThe government says, \u2018Sit here,\u2019 and I followed their orders. But I\u2019m not sure how long we can remain tolerant anymore. We are at the end of our patience.\u201d\nPolice officers in Sittwe confirm that Mr. Muhammad was a sergeant, but they distance themselves from him. \u201cIt is very difficult to trust the kalar,\u201d said U Khin Maung Kyaw, a Buddhist officer, using a derogatory term for people from the Indian subcontinent. \u201cThey want to make problems. They want to stab you in the back.\u201d\nMost families in the camp are almost entirely dependent on assistance from the United Nations and foreign aid agencies. The thousands who are not registered camp residents are not eligible for the United Nations rations.\nAbout 25,000 migrants left Myanmar and Bangladesh on rickety smugglers\u2019 boats in the first three months of 2015, according to a United Nations estimate.\nUntil two months ago, the government provided rice rations to the unregistered, but those have stopped. Very few people in the camp have jobs, so they survive off their savings and the kindness of others.\nMr. Islam, the fisherman, lives in a section called \u201cplastic camp,\u201d named for the scavenged materials the unregistered residents have used to improvise dwellings. In the shack next door, a 50-year-old man with tuberculosis can barely move from his bed. Sitting on a plastic chair outside is Rashid Ahmad, a listless 13-year-old with no control over his arms and legs. Doctors said he had polio, his mother says.\nFrom here, a boat to anywhere looks good.\nThe estimated 25,000 people who fled Myanmar and Bangladesh this year departed from numerous points along the Bay of Bengal, but the main departure point for migrants here was the beach at Ohn Daw Gyi, a fishing village adjacent to the camp.\nThere, within full view of a police outpost, they boarded small boats that took them to larger boats waiting at sea. Camp residents say traffickers paid the police to look the other way.\nThe police officers at the camp have recently been reshuffled, and the new head of the police outpost, Lt. Aung Toe Win, says all boats leaving the area will be checked.\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you what happened before the reshuffle,\u201d he said. \u201cOur new instructions are that every boat needs to show permission before leaving. We won\u2019t let any of the traffickers\u2019 boats pass.\u201d\nKobir Muhammad, a fisherman who was repairing a boat there one recent afternoon, said there had not been a departure of migrants in two months. \u201cIf the police don\u2019t allow it, no one can leave,\u201d he said.\nBut camp residents say that with so many people crammed into so little space and hope in such short supply, more departures are inevitable.\n\u201cThere are no jobs here; there\u2019s not enough food,\u201d said Abdul Salam, 54, a Rohingya businessman who prospered selling dried fish before his home was burned down three years ago. \u201cThey hear that in Malaysia they can get jobs. If they can get even very menial jobs, it\u2019s better than being here.\u201d",

    "text": "Key Shift on Malaysia Before Trans-Pacific Partnership Deal\n2015-07-27T16:00:03.000Z\nWASHINGTON \u2014 With the Obama administration pushing to conclude a vast Asian trade pact, the State Department on Monday upgraded its assessment of Malaysia\u2019s efforts to combat human trafficking, a move that could ease the country\u2019s inclusion in the trade deal.\nThough the human trafficking report from the State Department is released annually, this year it carries added weight because of the administration\u2019s desire to make final the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement spanning the Pacific Rim.\nCongress recently granted President Obama fast-track powers to complete negotiations on the deal, but it included a caveat that prohibited him from doing so with countries listed in Tier 3 of the State Department report \u2014 that is, countries that are not making a significant effort to combat human trafficking.\nMalaysia, whose relatively large economy makes its inclusion in the pact a priority for negotiators, was among the roughly two dozen countries in Tier 3 in last year\u2019s report. Its upgrade this year to what is known as the Tier 2 watch list, an intermediate step that indicates a country is trying to tackle human smuggling, immediately drew the anger of critics, who sought to link the improved standing of Malaysia to the trade deal.\n\u201cIt appears to us that this is a political move to ensure a seamless trade relationship,\u201d said Matthew F. Smith, the executive director of Fortify Rights, an advocacy group that investigates criminal organizations and government officials involved in human trafficking. \u201cThe message being sent is, \u2018Trade trumps human rights.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nThe department, for its part, said the two issues were not linked. \u201cThe aim of U.S. trade policy continues to be in the event of particular agreements to maintain a robust dialogue about rights protections,\u201d Under Secretary of State Sarah Sewall told reporters on Monday. \u201cSo that becomes another venue in which these issues can be discussed.\u201d\nAbout 25,000 migrants left Myanmar and Bangladesh on rickety smugglers\u2019 boats in the first three months of 2015, according to a United Nations estimate.\nApart from the controversy over Malaysia\u2019s ranking, the latest iteration of the State Department trafficking report also came amid rising concern about the depredations endured by migrants who are fleeing war, persecution and poverty in the Middle East, Asia and Africa, and the plight of young men and women who seek work only to be forced into slave-like conditions, such as the so-called sea slaves of Southeast Asia. Many of these sea slaves work on fishing boats in the South China Sea catching fish, much of which goes to Western markets as seafood or food for pets and livestock.\nAt a ceremony on Monday marking the release of this year\u2019s report, Secretary of State John Kerry directly referred to an article in The New York Times about the sea slaves, part of a series about lawlessness at sea called \u201cThe Outlaw Ocean.\u201d\n\u201cWe want to bring to the public\u2019s attention the full nature and scope of a $150 billion illicit trafficking industry, and it is an industry,\u201d Mr. Kerry told reporters. \u201cPick up today\u2019s New York Times, front page story about a young Cambodian boy promised a construction job in Thailand, goes across the border, finds himself held by armed men, and ultimately is pressed into service on the seas, three years at sea shackled by his neck to the boat.\u201d\nMigrants and refugees who pay smugglers to move them across borders face similar perils. The risks they endure were brought into sharp relief two months ago when thousands of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar and Bangladeshis who were seeking a better life were abandoned at sea by traffickers after being held for months in grim conditions aboard rickety wooden boats.\nTheir plight set off a regional crisis that ended only after Malaysia and Indonesia agreed to take them in. Survivors had since said that the trafficking rings by which they were held included people from Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar and Bangladesh.\nThough Asia has long struggled with human trafficking, only three countries from the region \u2014 Thailand, North Korea and the Marshall Islands \u2014 were placed in Tier 3 of the report. Most of the countries in Tier 3 enjoy limited ties to the United States, like Equatorial Guinea, or are hostile to American interests, like Syria and Russia.\nBut Thailand, with its relatively large economy, is a far different case, and its exclusion from the Trans-Pacific Partnership would leave a significant hole in the deal.\nIncluding it in Tier 3 means that the administration would have to waive the penalties that come with being put in the bottom tier of the report in order to finish negotiations with Thailand, a move that would most likely draw fresh criticism from Mr. Obama\u2019s liberal supporters, whose opposition nearly scuttled the trade pact.",

    "text": "Coalition Pushes for Memorial to the Triangle Fire\n2015-11-21T02:50:49.000Z\nA block east of Washington Square, not far from the neighborhood\u2019s boutiques and chic restaurants, was the site of one of the nation\u2019s worst industrial disasters. Many New Yorkers might be unaware of this.\nSome labor advocates are trying hard to change that. They have organized an effort to build a memorial to the infamous Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of 1911, in which 146 workers died. Most of them were young immigrant women from Eastern Europe and Italy, and more than 50 jumped to their deaths from the factory\u2019s ninth floor.\nThe building that housed the factory still stands, and the Remember the Triangle Fire Coalition \u2014 a group of the victims\u2019 descendants, labor advocates and other volunteers \u2014 is seeking to raise $2.4 million to build and maintain the memorial.\nSuzanne Pred Bass, a therapist on the Upper West Side of Manhattan whose great-aunt, Rose Weiner, died in the fire at age 23, said, \u201cA lot of the victims\u2019 families and the generation that followed, including me, have been waiting a long time for such a much-needed memorial.\u201d\nThe memorial would include several long steel panels running along the building\u2019s facade. One horizontal panel would be 13 feet high and have 146 names stenciled into the steel; below it would be a shiny, shin-high panel that would reflect the names from the stenciled panel above. The bottom panel would contain a narrative history of the fire, and a vertical panel would extend to the ninth floor.\nNew York University now owns the former factory building, at 29 Washington Place, and uses it mainly for its biology and chemistry laboratories. The university is backing the memorial.\nThe Remember the Triangle Fire Coalition sponsored a design competition in 2013 and selected a proposal by Richard Joon Yoo, an architectural designer, and Uri Wegman, a professor of architecture at Cooper Union. The winner of the competition was awarded $5,000, which was donated by the faculty union at the Fashion Institute of Technology.\n\u201cWhat makes this memorial unique is it\u2019s about the past, but also so much about the present,\u201d said Mr. Yoo, who noted that around the time of the competition in 2013, 112 workers died in a factory fire in Bangladesh and then over 1,100 died in a factory collapse there.\n\u201cIt\u2019s 100 years after the Triangle fire, but some of the exact same factors were at work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s appalling. It\u2019s like you can have the Holocaust happen all over again, and zero lessons were learned.\u201d\nWhen a fire broke out at the Triangle factory on March 25, 1911, numerous factors \u2014 beyond the flammability of the cloth \u2014 turned it into a calamity. The Fire Department\u2019s tallest ladders reached only six floors, while the factory\u2019s nearly 500 employees worked on the eighth, ninth and 10th floors. The managers of the factory had locked a ninth-floor door to one of the two staircases and were slow to notify workers on the ninth floor about the fire, which began on the eighth floor. The fire escape was so poorly constructed that it collapsed and crashed to the ground when it filled with workers. The factory did not conduct fire drills and was not equipped with overhead sprinklers, which some other factories had already started installing.\nThe Triangle fire prompted a wave of safety reforms: New York began requiring automatic sprinklers in tall buildings and fire drills at large workplaces.\nFrances Perkins, who was then the leader of the New York office of the National Consumers League and who later became the state labor commissioner and the federal labor secretary under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, witnessed the fire and the workers jumping. She had been having tea at a friend\u2019s townhouse on Washington Square.\nThe disaster and the images of dozens of bodies on the sidewalk outside the factory scarred the city\u2019s psyche. Hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers marched down Fifth Avenue to honor the dead.\nMr. Yoo and Mr. Wegman say their design will encourage contemplation and participation. \u201cWe thought of the memorial as a space that needs to be slowly discovered through the engagement and the curiosity of the viewer,\u201d Mr. Wegman said. \u201cThe names of the victims cannot be read at first glance; they have to be discovered through some kind of engagement or participation.\u201d\nMary Anne Trasciatti, the president of the Triangle Coalition, praised the memorial\u2019s design. \u201cIt positions the spectator to what happened in 1911, because your eyes are drawn upwards where the fire was raging and downward to see the names,\u201d she said.\nDavid Von Drehle, author of \u201cTriangle: The Fire That Changed America,\u201d said he became interested in the fire when he walked past the building and saw several small plaques about the disaster. \u201cThe time is ripe for something fuller than those little plaques on the building,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an important event in New York labor history and in the history of women\u2019s rights and labor rights.\u201d\nThe Triangle Coalition began planning for the memorial in 2010, when it was organizing a ceremony for the centennial of the fire. But planning the ceremony delayed construction on the memorial, which will cost more than the coalition had anticipated. To raise money, it has set up a nonprofit organization.\n\u201cOne of the things we learned talking to people who worked on the 9/11 memorials is unless you have a powerful figure backing you, these things take a long time,\u201d said Ms. Trasciatti, a professor at Hofstra University whose mother and grandparents were garment workers.\nShe said $2.4 million would be needed to construct the panels, attach them to the building and maintain the memorial. She wants to use some of the money to award scholarships to children of garment workers and to college and graduate students of labor history. The coalition hopes to obtain funding from the City Council, the State Legislature, labor unions and the public.\n\u201cThe memorial will be a reminder of the struggles that keep us safe now, as workers and as citizens,\u201d she said. \u201cThese things were achieved on the backs of immigrant workers and women workers.

    "text": "Myanmar Striking Rohingya From Voter Rolls, Activists Say\n2015-08-23T16:35:36.000Z\nYANGON, Myanmar \u2014 As an elected lawmaker and member of Myanmar\u2019s governing party, U Shwe Maung attended dinners with the president and made speeches from the floor of Parliament. But this weekend, the country\u2019s election commission ruled that despite more than four years in office, he was not a citizen and thus was ineligible to run for re-election in landmark voting in November.\n\u201cI was approved and considered a full citizen in 2010,\u201d he said in an interview on Saturday. \u201cNow, after five years, how could I not be eligible?\u201d\nMr. Shwe Maung\u2019s plight is but one example of what appears to be the mass disenfranchisement of the Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority who number around one million in Myanmar.\nHundreds of thousands of Rohingya who cast votes in elections five years ago have been struck from the electoral rolls, election commission officials have confirmed, although without providing a precise number.\nThe final list of eligible voters is due by the end of August, but it is unlikely that any Rohingya will be added given anti-Muslim feelings in the country, Rohingya leaders say.\nPersecution of the Rohingya has escalated in recent years with the rise of a shadowy Buddhist nationalist movement that has demonized Muslims and encouraged the eviction of Rohingya from the country. Although many Rohingya have lived in Myanmar for generations, hatred has built up against them and they are referred to as Bengalis by the government, a name that implies they belong in neighboring Bangladesh.\nYet until now, they have never lost the right to vote.\nThe Rohingya have taken part in every election since Myanmar became independent from Britain in 1948, including one-candidate elections during the rule of the military dictator Ne Win.\n\u201cAll other fundamental rights have been taken away by the authorities,\u201d said Wai Wai Nu, a Rohingya activist who met with President Obama at the White House in June and warned of mass disenfranchisement. \u201cIf we lose the right to vote, we will be zero.\u201d\nMr. Shwe Maung, who left the governing party earlier this month to run as an independent, was informed by fax on Saturday that he had been disqualified for re-election. The election commission said his parents were not citizens at the time of his birth, an assertion that he calls absurd: His father was a career-long officer in the national police force. Mr. Shwe Maung is appealing the disqualification.\nThe election on Nov. 8 has been described by Western governments and human rights organizations as a major test of Myanmar\u2019s nascent democracy because it is the first time since military rule that democratic forces, led by the Nobel Peace laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, will be vying in a general election against the military-backed governing party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party.\nDavid Scott Mathieson, a Myanmar expert with Human Rights Watch, called the exclusion of the Rohingya \u201ca dark cloud over the democratic integrity of the elections over all.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the government really stripping them of their last right,\u201d Mr. Mathieson said. \u201cIt suits the government\u2019s long-term plan of compelling them to leave.\u201d\nVoter registration lists released by the election commission in June showed that more than 500,000 Rohingya had vanished from the rolls, Rohingya activists say.\nU Kyaw Min, a former schoolteacher who is president of the Democracy and Human Rights Party, a Rohingya party, says the number of eligible voters in a single district, Buthidaung, fell to 27,000 from more than 150,000 in 2010.\nMr. Kyaw Min, who is Ms. Wai Wai Nu\u2019s father, says one of his earliest memories is of accompanying his mother to vote in Buthidaung in the 1956 election.\n\u201cThis is a grand discrimination against a minority,\u201d Mr. Kyaw Min said of the removal of Rohingya voters from the rolls. \u201cThere were only two other places where this happened \u2014 in South Africa and Hitler\u2019s Germany.\u201d\nThe election commission says it cannot allow Rohingya to register to vote because they do not have proof of citizenship. Earlier this year, President Thein Sein, acting under pressure from Buddhist nationalists, decreed that the special identity cards held by the Rohingya, known as white cards, would no longer be valid and that Rohingya would have to undergo a citizenship test in order to obtain new cards.\nTens of thousands of white cards were surrendered to the government. Other Rohingya lost all their possessions when they were chased from their homes by Buddhist mobs in a series of deadly pogroms that began in 2012.\nMore than 140,000 Rohingya remain in government camps in Rakhine State on Myanmar\u2019s western coast. Thousands more have fled the country by sea this year, leading to a regionwide migrant crisis.\nThe election commission says it cannot bend from its position: People must prove their citizenship before being able to vote.\n\u201cIf the immigration officers cannot issue the cards in time, they cannot vote,\u201d said Thant Zin Aung, assistant director of the election commission.\nThe widespread hatred toward Rohingya in Myanmar stems partly from resentment held over from colonial times, when the British brought Indians into the country, then known as Burma, as laborers and civil servants. Today, Buddhist nationalists warn of a threat of the Islamization of Burmese society and point to the swollen population of Bangladesh next door.\nU Thar Pwint, a lawyer in Rakhine State who describes himself as moderate, says Muslim culture is not compatible with Buddhist society.\n\u201cTheir culture does not allow living together with other cultures,\u201d he said.\nHe proposes a radical solution for the Rohingya that is heard often among Buddhists in Myanmar.\n\u201cEven though they are noncitizens, we cannot kill them,\u201d he said. \u201cOur wish is that they be put in another country.\u201d",

    "text": "No Humans Were Harmed in the Making of This Product\n2015-06-07T10:00:30.000Z\nFRANKFURT \u2014 A Burmese migrant worker is sold by traffickers as a slave to the owner of a Thai fishing boat. The catch of the boat is used to make fish meal to feed farmed shrimp. The shrimp wind up in supermarkets in the United States and Europe.\nIssues of security and economics tend to attract the most attention at Group of 7 meetings. But when President Obama and other leaders of the nations in the group meet at the Bavarian spa resort of Schloss Elmau on June 7 and 8, one of the items on the agenda will be related to those Thai shrimp.\nThe leaders plan to discuss so-called supply chain standards \u2014 ways of ensuring that everyday products like food, electronics and jewelry do not come packaged with human misery as a hidden ingredient.\nAbuses in the Thai fishing industry have been well documented and were the subject of hearings in the United States Congress in April. The Group of 7 countries \u2014 Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States \u2014 represent 45 percent of global economic output, which gives them considerable power to push for better working conditions not only for Thai fishing crews but also for miners in Democratic Republic of Congo and textile workers in Bangladesh.\nThe urgency was underlined on May 14 after at least 72 workers died in a fire that consumed a factory near Manila that made rubber sandals and slippers. The products were made for local markets, according to news reports, but the events showed the potentially deadly consequences of unsafe working conditions.\nNo producer wants to be excluded from markets in the Group of 7. While the gathering of wealthy nations is known more for bland communiqu\u00e9s than bold initiatives, even a statement of resolve on supply chain standards would be welcome, watchdog groups say.\n\u201cWe would love to see the G-7 leaders make a strong commitment to this,\u201d said Sophia Pickles, a senior campaigner at Global Witness, an advocacy group. \u201cIt would be an important signal.\u201d\nThe United States and other countries already have rules designed to ensure that imported products are not contributing to human rights abuses or environmental damage. Dodd-Frank, the American law designed to address the financial crisis, has a provision requiring companies to disclose if they were using minerals like tungsten and gold exported illegally from the Democratic Republic of Congo or neighboring countries.\nBut watchdogs say the wealthy nations need to do more to ensure that existing rules are more rigorously enforced.\n\u201cGovernments really need to start closing the door to illegally produced products,\u201d said Jason Clay, a senior vice president at the World Wildlife Fund, which has pushed for improved scrutiny of timber and of other products that are often harvested in developing countries and exported to rich ones.\nPerhaps surprisingly, some corporations have been moving faster than governments to scrutinize where their products come from and to ensure they are not tainted, Mr. Clay said. The collapse of a building in Rana Plaza in Bangladesh in 2013, in which more than 1,100 textile workers were killed, demonstrated to retailers like Walmart how their own reputations and sales could be at risk from unscrupulous suppliers.\nWalmart denied reports that one of its suppliers had purchased jeans made by a company at the Rana Plaza complex. But Walmart has stepped up scrutiny of its supply chain and contributed to a fund for victims of the disaster.\n\u201cEven in the height of recession, companies were investing in sustainability because they knew their futures depended on it,\u201d Mr. Clay said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see that commitment from governments. They have trouble managing their own piece of the planet.\u201d\nThe push to put supply chains on the Group of 7 agenda comes largely from Germany, the world\u2019s third-largest exporter after China and the United States. Germany, host of the meeting this year, is also the world\u2019s third-largest importer, in part because of the raw materials required for its auto makers and other industries.\n\u201cThe rich industrial countries need to establish fundamental standards worldwide, so that these will be adopted by others,\u201d said Gerd M\u00fcller, the German minister for economic cooperation and development.\nThe European Commission is considering a proposal that would encourage companies to scrutinize whether minerals they use are coming from conflict areas. There are already similar rules in place that apply to timber and diamonds.\nGlobal Witness and other nongovernmental organizations have complained, though, that the European proposal calls for voluntary rather than mandatory compliance. Companies such as mobile phone manufacturers would be certified as a European Union \u201cresponsible importer\u201d if they documented that raw materials they were purchasing were not being used to help finance armed conflict. But there would be no legal obligation for them to do so.\n\u201cThe commission\u2019s proposal is from our point of view extremely weak,\u201d said Michael Gibb, a campaign leader at Global Witness in London who specializes in so-called conflict resources. Although Germany pushed to put supply chains on the agenda, he said, it is one of the countries that has resisted mandatory rules.\nOthers say that voluntary rules are easier to steer through the political process and potentially just as effective.\nA strong statement from the wealthy countries at the summit meeting would have a powerful effect on the developing countries that are the main suppliers, said Mr. M\u00fcller, the German development minister.\nHe noted that voluntary rules were more practical. \u201cYou can\u2019t change world trade overnight with regulations,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is decisive is that the industrial countries commit themselves to sustainable standards.\u201d\nGabriela Ramos, chief of staff at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the person responsible for summit meeting preparations, said that reaching agreement on common supply chain standards would be significant.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for the G-7 to be leading by example,\u201d Ms. Ramos said. \u201cSometimes you need to make progress in any way you can. Of course we would like to make everything obligatory. International law is more complicated than that.\u201d",

    "text": "On a Tropical Christmas in New York, Traditions Melt Away\n2015-12-25T19:19:13.000Z\nAs she stood before the ice skating rink at the center of Bryant Park in Manhattan, dressed as Mrs. Claus in a red velveteen outfit trimmed with white faux fur, Alejandra Silva was the picture of Christmas \u2014 in Miami.\nThe dress was thigh-length, sleeveless and skin tight. And still, on the night before Christmas, she was overheating.\n\u201cI\u2019m sweating!\u201d Ms. Silva said, while her 5-year-old son played at her feet. \u201cLast year we made a snowman on our terrace,\u201d she added, fanning herself. \u201cThis year my son wants an ice cream!\u201d\nRecord-breaking warm weather has blanketed the region, lending an almost tropical feel to what should be a season of scarves and hot cocoa. Roses have bloomed in planters near the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center, and beach volleyball games \u2014 played shirtless \u2014 heated up on Thursday and Friday in Central Park.\nBut as the mercury reached a record-setting 66 degrees in Central Park on Christmas Day \u2014 a day after it hit 72 \u2014 there was a sense that the heat had given an unwelcome dimension to the traditional holiday spirit.\ntranscript\nNA\nOn a typical crisp December day, Mohamed Elsayed, 36, a street vendor who works on a corner near Radio City Music Hall, sells 30 to 40 pounds of roasted chestnuts from his cart. By midafternoon on Christmas Day, he had only sold about five pounds.\n\u201cYou know the song? \u2018Chestnuts roasting on an open fire?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Elsayed said. \u201cToday, no chestnuts!\u201d\nAll season long, Mohammad Mannan, 62, who helps run a newsstand in Times Square, has been hawking fuzzy Santa hats for $3. (An extra $2 buys a version fit for when Santa goes club-hopping, with spangles and plastic stars.) Last year, the hats sold briskly, 20 a day, said Mr. Mannan, who is originally from Bangladesh. On Thursday, he had sold only two. \u201cThis is the weather in Bangladesh!\u201d he said.\nThe warmth upended some holiday traditions. Ms. Silva, 30, noted the thin layer of water atop the ice at Bryant Park and did not let her son skate. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous,\u201d she said.\nNext to the rink, at the pop-up restaurant Celsius, ceiling fans whirred on high speed. In the pre-Christmas mugginess, even watching a yule log burn on a screen seemed too stifling.\nErica Irwin, 39, a photographer from Manhattan, was walking her three minuscule, mixed-breed rescue dogs on Thompson Street on Friday, but only one wore a Santa costume.\n\u201cIt\u2019s because it\u2019s Christmas and because he gets coldest,\u201d she said. The dog was from Texas, she explained, and was perhaps accustomed to warmer climates.\nIf so, the dog has had an easy transition. The average temperature thus far in December has been 51.6 degrees, which is 13.1 degrees above what the National Weather Service defines as normal for the month.\nFor some, the weather served as a balm of sorts. Nate Henninger, an art photographer, trudged down Avenue of the Americas near Bleecker Street on Thursday, carrying a last-minute Charlie Brown-size pine tree on his shoulder, sweat beading on his lip. His plans for a romantic holiday getaway had suddenly changed, but the weather helped mitigate any disappointment.\n\u201cYou have your built-in expectations about what Christmas is going to be like,\u201d he said. But with the warm weather, he added, \u201cyou can just relax and just enjoy.\u201d\nIn Greenwich Village in Manhattan, Bobby Gilliland, 70, a visitor from Belfast, Ireland, on his last day of vacation, was wearing a new Christmas sweater \u2014 \u201cSanta brought it last night,\u201d he said \u2014 featuring a penguin, also wearing a Christmas sweater.\nHe almost did not wear it, said his son, Rob Gilliland, 39, an airline pilot. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019ll save it for the aircraft because it will be cooler,\u2019\u00a0\u201d the son said. \u201cBut I convinced him.\u201d\nEvery night before Christmas for the past 35 years, Woodlands Community Temple, a Reform Jewish congregation in Greenburgh, N.Y., near White Plains, sends a group of young congregants, their parents and other volunteers on a mission to New York City, where they spend the early hours of Christmas morning passing out coats, blankets and meals to homeless people.\nThis year, some of those things seemed an ill fit. So just before the excursion, Dayle Fligel, the synagogue\u2019s president, stocked up on T-shirts, too, concerned about how the heavy-duty donations would be received.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this weather,\u201d she said before the event. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it in the rain, we\u2019ve done it in the snow, we\u2019ve done it in the sleet, but we\u2019ve never done it in 70-degree weather.\u201d\nShe need not have worried. Most years, Ms. Fligel said, the volunteers, organized by Midnight Run, a charitable organization based in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., must seek out willing recipients; on colder nights, the homeless people on the street can be difficult to find. This year the turnout was in the hundreds, she said after the synagogue\u2019s run concluded, with people waiting for donations outdoors in the winter warmth.\n\u201cPeople were getting the coats and getting the blankets,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they know the weather is coming.\u201d New Yorkers were also out strolling, she said, and some seemed moved by what they saw.\nHer personal Christmas tradition was unchanged. \u201cChinese food, a movie and family\u201d would carry on, Ms. Fligel said, whatever the weather.",

    "text": "Murder at Sea: Captured on Video, but Killers Go Free\n2015-07-20T07:31:00.000Z\nSHARJAH KHALID PORT, United Arab Emirates \u2014 The man bobbing in the sea raises his arms in a seeming sign of surrender before he is shot in the head. He floats face down as his blood stains the blue water.\nA slow-motion slaughter unfolds over the next 6 minutes and 58 seconds. Three other men floating in the ocean, some clinging to what looks like the wreckage of an overturned wooden boat, are surrounded by several large white tuna longliners. The sky above is clear and blue; the sea below, dark and choppy. As the ships\u2019 engines idle loudly, at least 40 rounds are fired as the unarmed men are methodically picked off.\n\u201cShoot, shoot, shoot!\u201d commands a voice over one of the ship\u2019s loudspeakers as the final man is killed. Soon after, a group of men on deck who appear to be crew members laugh among themselves, then pose for selfies.\nDespite dozens of witnesses on at least four ships, those killings remain a mystery. No one even reported the incident \u2014 there is no requirement to do so under maritime law nor any clear method for mariners, who move from port to port, to volunteer what they know. Law enforcement officials learned of the deaths only after a video of the killings was found on a cellphone left in a taxi in Fiji last year, then posted on the Internet.\nWith no bodies, no identified victims and no exact location of where the shootings occurred, it is unclear which, if any, government will take responsibility for leading an investigation. Taiwanese fishing authorities, who based on the video connected a fishing boat from Taiwan to the scene but learned little from the captain, say they believe the dead men were part of a failed pirate attack. But maritime security experts, warning that piracy has become a convenient cover for sometimes fatal score-settling, said it is just as likely that the men were local fishermen in disputed waters, mutinied crew, castoff stowaways or thieves caught stealing fish or bait.\n\u201cSummary execution, vigilantism, overzealous defense, call it what you will,\u201d said Klaus Luhta, a lawyer with the International Organization of Masters, Mates & Pilots, a seafarers\u2019 union. \u201cThis boils down just the same to a case of murder at sea and a question of why it\u2019s allowed to happen.\u201d\nThe oceans, plied by more ships than ever before, are also more armed and dangerous than any time since World War II, naval historians say. Thousands of seamen every year are victims of violence, with hundreds killed, according to maritime security officials, insurers and naval researchers. Last year in three regions alone \u2014 the western Indian Ocean, Southeast Asia and the Gulf of Guinea off West Africa \u2014 more than 5,200 seafarers were attacked by pirates and robbers and more than 500 were taken hostage, a database built by The New York Times shows.\nMany merchant vessels hired private security starting in 2008 as pirates began operating across larger expanses of the ocean, outstripping governments\u2019 policing capacities. Guns and guards at sea are now so ubiquitous that a niche industry of floating armories has emerged. The vessels \u2014 part storage depot, part bunkhouse \u2014 are positioned in high-risk areas of international waters and house hundreds of assault rifles, small arms and ammunition. Guards on board wait, sometimes for months in decrepit conditions, for their next deployment.\nThough pirate attacks on large container ships, like that depicted in the film \u201cCaptain Phillips,\u201d have dropped sharply over the past several years, other forms of violence remain pervasive.\nArmed gangs run protection rackets requiring ship captains to pay for safe passage in the Bay of Bengal near Bangladesh. Nigerian marine police officers routinely work in concert with fuel thieves, according to maritime insurance investigators. Off the coast of Somalia, United Nations officials say, some pirates who used to target bigger ships have transitioned into \u201csecurity\u201d work on board foreign and local fishing vessels, fending off armed attacks, but also firing on rivals to scare them away.\nProvocations are common. Countries are racing one another to map and lay claim to untapped oil, gas or other mineral resources deep in the ocean, sparking clashes and boat burnings. From the Mediterranean to offshore Australia to the Black Sea, human traffickers carrying refugees and migrants sometimes ram competitors\u2019 boats or deliberately sink their own ships to get rid of their illicit passengers or force a rescue.\nViolence among fishing boats is widespread and getting worse. Heavily subsidized Chinese and Taiwanese vessels are aggressively expanding their reach, said Graham Southwick, the president of the Fiji Tuna Boat Owners Association. Radar advancements and the increased use of so-called fish-aggregating devices \u2014 floating objects that attract schools of fish \u2014 have heightened tensions as fishermen are more prone to crowd the same spots. \u201cCatches shrink, tempers fray, fighting starts,\u201d Mr. Southwick said. \u201cMurder on these boats is relatively common.\u201d\nThe violent crime rate related to fishing boats is easily 20 times that of crimes involving tankers, cargo ships or passenger ships, said Charles N. Dragonette, who tracked seafaring attacks globally for the United States Office of Naval Intelligence until 2012. \u201cSo long as the victims were Indonesian, Malay, Vietnamese, Filipino, just not European or American, the story never resonated,\u201d he said.\nProsecutions for crimes at sea are rare \u2014 one former United States Coast Guard official put it at \u201cless than 1 percent\u201d \u2014 because many ships lack insurance and captains are averse to the delays and prying that can come with a police investigation. The few military and law enforcement ships that patrol international waters are usually forbidden from boarding ships flying another country\u2019s flag unless given permission. Witnesses willing to speak up are scarce; so is physical evidence.\nViolence at sea and on land are handled differently, Mr. Dragonette said. \u201cAshore, no matter how brutal the repression or how corrupt the local government, someone will know who the victims are, where they were, that they did not return,\u201d he said. \u201cAt sea, anonymity is the rule.\u201d\nThe creaky wooden fishing boat strained to cut through eight-foot swells on a clear black night, as its captain, who goes only by the name Rio, spread out a regional map.\nHeaded north, about 50 miles from the Natuna Islands in the South China Sea, he tapped his finger on his location, widened his eyes and contorted his face to register fear. Then, he silently reached over and opened a wheelhouse compartment revealing a Glock handgun.\nHe had a good reason to be armed. The waters in this region, especially those near Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam, are among the most perilous in the world. More than 3,100 mariners were assaulted or kidnapped in the area last year, according to the Times database, consisting of more than 6,000 crime reports.\nThe database includes information provided by the Office of Naval Intelligence; two maritime security firms, OceanusLive and Risk Intelligence; and a research group called Oceans Beyond Piracy. No international agency comprehensively tracks maritime violence.\nThe death tolls in these attacks are murky because follow-up investigations are rare, police reports often lack details and bodies tend to disappear at sea. But maritime researchers estimated that hundreds of seafarers are killed annually in attacks. (They caution those numbers are likely to be undercounts because they do not include deaths close to shore or in some particularly dangerous areas where deaths are rarely reported to international authorities.)\nTypical culprits included: rubber-skiff pirates armed with rocket-propelled grenades, night-stalking fuel thieves, hit-and-run bandits wielding machetes. But a variety of other actors appear too, and many of them are not as they initially seem: hijackers masquerading as marine police officers, human traffickers posing as fishermen, security guards moonlighting as arms dealers.\nFor instance, there were 10 Sri Lankan migrants, a group that included women and children, who were smuggled aboard a fishing boat in 2012 near the island nation. When their demands to set a new course for Australia were refused, the migrants attacked the crew, killing at least two men by throwing them overboard. Or the three captive Burmese workers who in 2009 escaped their Thai trawler in the South China Sea by leaping overboard, swimming to a nearby yacht, killing its owner and stealing his lifeboat.\nThe waters near Bangladesh illustrate why maritime violence is frequently overlooked by the international community. In the past five years, nearly 100 sailors and fishermen have been killed annually in Bangladeshi waters \u2014 and as least as many taken hostage \u2014 in a string of attacks by armed gangs, according to local media and police reports.\nArmed assaults have been a problem there for two decades, according to insurance and maritime security analysts. In 2013, the Bangladeshi media reported the abduction of more than 700 fishermen, 150 in September alone. Forty were reported killed in a single episode, many of them with their feet and hands bound before being thrown overboard.\nThese attacks were usually conducted by the half-dozen armed gangs that operate protection rackets in the Bay of Bengal and the swampy inland waters called the Sundarbans. Last year, they engaged in gun battles with the Bangladesh Air Force and Coast Guard during government raids on coastal camps and hostage ships.\nBangladesh\u2019s former foreign minister, Dr. Dipu Moni, reprimanded the international shipping industry and the foreign and local news media several years ago for defaming the country by describing its waters as a \u201chigh risk\u201d zone for piracy.\n\u201cThere has not been a single incident of piracy\u201d in years, Dr. Moni said in a December 2011 written statement, adding that most of the violence off the nation\u2019s coast involved petty theft and robberies, most often committed by \u201cdacoits\u201d (a term derived from the Hindi word for bandits).\nThose claims pivot on a legal distinction between piracy, which under international law occurs on the high seas or in waters farther than 12 miles from shore, and robbery, which involves attacks closer to land.\nInsurance companies once charged $500 for each trip to and from the ports located in the west of India, but increased the rate to $150,000, given the area\u2019s piracy-prone designation, a Bangladeshi foreign ministry official said during a news conference in December 2011. After Bangladeshi officials protested to the International Maritime Bureau, which tracks piracy at sea, that their country was stigmatized as a high-piracy zone, the group amended its website to say its warning covered piracy and armed robbery.\nIn an interview, Mukundan Pottengal, the director of the bureau, which is primarily funded by shipping companies and insurers, said his organization does not try to determine the exact location of attacks or whether they are in national or international waters, partly because these details are often contested by countries.\n\u201cWhether they are called pirates or robbers is a legal distinction,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does not change the nature of their act or the danger to the ship or crew when armed strangers get on board their ship.\u201d\nOn his fishing boat, Rio said that violence is just a part of life at sea. \u201cYou must be ready, always ready,\u201d he said. For instance, he explained that larger, unlicensed fishing vessels in the area often plow through local fishermen\u2019s nets, not just eliminating their catch, but destroying their livelihoods.\nMaking a hand gesture as though he was firing his gun in the air, Rio revved his engine, lurching the boat forward, showing how he charged at others in these situations.\nA wiry chain-smoker, Rio recounted the last time he used his gun. A year earlier, he said, he fired at a bigger ship that approached his boat late at night without permission. Rio said he then sped away, uncertain whether he had hit anyone on board.\nAsked whether he reported the shooting to the police, Rio crinkled his face as if he did not understand. After several silent minutes, he asked: \u201cWhy would anyone report that?\u201d\nAbout 25 miles offshore from the United Arab Emirates in the Gulf of Oman, a half-dozen private security guards sat on the upper deck of the Resolution, a St. Kitts and Nevis-flagged floating armory. After the men traded war stories about past encounters with pirates, the conversation soon turned to a shared concern: the growing influx of untrained hires into the booming $13 billion-a-year security business.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like handing a bachelor a newborn,\u201d one guard said, describing how some of the new recruits react when given a semiautomatic weapon. Many of the new hires lack combat experience, speak virtually no English (despite a fluency requirement), and do not know how to clean or fix their weapons, said the guards, most of whom spoke only on the condition of anonymity for fear they would be blacklisted from jobs. Some of the recruits show up to work carrying ammunition in Ziploc bags or shoe boxes.\nThe maritime security industry includes fewer fly-by-night companies today than it did several years ago, according to the guards. But the potential for mishandling attacks \u2014 with possibly deadly consequences \u2014 has increased over the past year or so, they argued, because the shipping industry has been cutting costs, shifting from four-man security teams to teams of two or three less experienced men.\nThe 141-foot Resolution is among several dozen converted cargo ships, tugboats and demining barges that have been parked in high-risk areas of the Red Sea, Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, usually just outside national waters. The guards pay as little as $25 per night to stay on the ship (the charge for carrying the men to and from client ships is often several thousand dollars), and check their weapons into a locked storage container upon arrival. Then they wait, sometimes for weeks, for their next job.\nSomali piracy spurred many governments to encourage merchant vessels to arm themselves or hire private security, a break from the longstanding practice of nations trying to maintain a near monopoly on the use of force. Meanwhile, growing terrorism concerns led port officials globally to impose tighter restrictions on weapons being carried into national waters. Floating armories emerged as a solution.\nOn the Resolution, security \u201cteam leaders,\u201d most of them American, British or South African military veterans, explained what makes gun battles at sea so different from those on land.\ntranscript\nN/A\n\u201cBetween fight or flight,\u201d said Cameron Mouat, a guard working for MNG Maritime, a British company that charters the Resolution. \u201cOut here, there\u2019s just fight.\u201d There is no place to hide, no falling back, no air support, no ammunition drops, he said. Targets are almost always fast moving. Aim is usually wobbly because the ship constantly sways.\nSome ships are the equivalent of several football fields in length, too big, these guards contended, for a two- or three-man security detail to handle, especially when attackers arrive in multiple boats.\nDiscerning threats is difficult. Semiautomatic weapons, formerly a pirates\u2019 telltale sign, are now found on virtually all boats traversing dangerous waters, they said. Smugglers, with no intention of attacking, routinely nestle close to larger merchant ships to hide in their radar shadow and avoid being detected by coastal authorities. Fishing boats also sometimes tuck behind larger ships because they churn up sea-bottom sediment that attracts fish.\n\u201cThe concern isn\u2019t just whether a new guard will misjudge or panic and fire too soon,\u201d explained a South African guard. \u201cIt\u2019s also whether he will shoot soon enough.\u201d If guards hesitate too long, he said, they miss the chance to take preventive measures that can help avoid fatal force, like firing warning shots, flares or water cannons, or incapacitating an approaching boat\u2019s engine.\nThe armories themselves can be crucibles of violence. Guards climbing off another floating armory, the Seapol One, pulled out their smartphones and showed pictures of the infested, cramped, trash-strewn cabins where eight men bunked.\nLike most floating armories, the Seapol One, run by the Sri Lankan firm Avant Garde Maritime Services, had no armed security of its own to police its guests or protect against pirates who might seek to commandeer the arsenal. Most coastal nations oppose the armories, though they can do little to stop them since they are situated in international waters.\nNone of the guards interviewed knew of any fatal clashes on the armories. But there was no shortage of friction, they said. A Latvian guard, weighing more than 300 pounds and standing well over six feet, relieved himself in the shower because he could not fit in the bathroom stalls. Confronted by other guards, he refused to clean it up.\nSeveral days earlier a heated argument erupted between two South African guards and their team leader. Unpaid for nearly a month, the men had been abandoned by their security company and left on the Seapol with no way to get back to port.\nKevin Thompson, a British guard, described intense boredom and isolation, which some guards relieved with occasional drinks of forbidden alcohol or by lifting weights, assisted by steroids. Describing the armories, he said, \u201cThey\u2019re basically psychological pressure cookers.\u201d\nThe video of the killing of the four men speaks to a survival-of-the-fittest brutality common at sea, according to a dozen security experts who reviewed the footage. They speculated that one gunman, quite likely a private security guard, did all the shooting, using a semiautomatic weapon. And, they said, the four ships at the scene were probably associated with one another, perhaps by shared ownership. \u201cYou don\u2019t rob a bank in mixed company,\u201d one former United States Coast Guard official explained.\nLast summer, the police in the Fijian capital of Suva closed their investigation into the shootings. They reasoned that the incident did not occur in their national waters, nor did it involve their vessels. Since no Fijian mariners had been reported missing, they concluded none of their citizens were among the victims.\nWhen governments investigate incidents like this, their goal is typically not to find the culprit, said Glen Forbes from OceanusLive, the maritime risk firm. \u201cIt\u2019s to clear their name.\u201d\nThe video, which includes people speaking Chinese, Indonesian and Vietnamese languages, shows three large vessels circling the floating men. A banner that says \u201cSafety is No. 1\u201d in Chinese hangs in the background on the deck of one of the ships. A fourth vessel, which maritime records indicate is a 725-ton Taiwanese-owned tuna longliner called Chun I 217, passes by in the background.\nLin Yu-chih, the owner of the Chun I 217, which remains at sea, said that he did not know whether any of the more than a dozen other ships he owns or operates were present when the men were shot. \u201cOur captain left as soon as possible,\u201d Mr. Lin said, referring to the shooting scene.\nThough the date of the shooting is unknown, he said that he believed it occurred in 2013 in the Indian Ocean, where the Chun I 217 has been sailing for the last five years.\nMr. Lin declined to release any details about the crew of the Chun I 217 or the report he said he asked the captain to write about the killings after the Taiwan police contacted his company. Mr. Lin, a board member of the Taiwanese tuna longliners association, said the private security guards on his ships were provided by a Sri Lankan company, which he declined to name. The Taiwan prosecutor\u2019s office, which is looking into the matter, declined to comment.\nWith one of the world\u2019s largest tuna fleets, Taiwan\u2019s fishing industry is among the nation\u2019s biggest employers and most politically powerful sectors.\nTwo Taiwanese fishing officials later said that the company authorized to put private security guards on Taiwanese ships was Avant Garde Maritime Services, the same business that runs the Seapol One, the armory in the Gulf of Oman. The company declined to answer questions about its guards or its floating armories.\nTzu-Yaw Tsay, the director of the Taiwanese fisheries agency, declined during an interview to release the Chun I 217\u2019s crew list or captain\u2019s name. He suggested, though, that the men in the water were most likely pirates who had been rebuffed.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d Mr. Tsay then acknowledged. \u201cSo there\u2019s no way for us to say whether it\u2019s legal.\u201d",

    "text": "Jackson Heights, Queens: Diverse and Evolving\n2015-05-20T09:00:28.000Z\nCall it the Brooklyn breaking point, when the cool factor of Kings County is not enough to compensate for a less-than-ideal living situation.\nFor Joseph I. Dube and his wife, Frances Cabrera, it came last year. After realizing they could not afford to buy a place in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, where they had been renting, the couple began looking in Sunset Park.\nBut though that neighborhood was more affordable, it required a longer trip by subway to Midtown Manhattan, where Mr. Dube and Ms. Cabrera both work. And they were discouraged when the offers they made on apartments there were unsuccessful.\nThey had better luck in Jackson Heights, in north-central Queens, a historic and heterogeneous area less than a half-hour from Midtown \u2014 and, pricewise, a world away from trendier enclaves.\n\u201cThe co-op buildings here, they have a certain look and feel, like the buildings we loved by Prospect Park,\u201d Mr. Dube said. Last fall the couple paid $399,000 for a two-bedroom with prewar details like crown molding and glass doorknobs.\nIt also has rear windows overlooking a private garden, a feature of many Jackson Heights apartment buildings. Outside Mr. Dube and Ms. Cabrera\u2019s apartment, a magnolia tree flowers; Mr. Dube has planted jalape\u00f1o peppers nearby.\nThose gardens also help offset a neighborhood weakness, a shortage of public parks, one that city officials have tried to address by closing some streets to create pedestrian plazas. \u201cWe could use more open green space,\u201d said Mr. Dube, who for now ducks into the shaded grounds of St. Mark\u2019s Episcopal Church on 82nd Street and 34th Avenue.\nWith many of its apartments built by a single developer, the Queensboro Corporation, in the first half of the 20th century, Jackson Heights can have a uniform appearance, with block after block of similar six-story brick structures.\nBut its sidewalks are strikingly diverse. About half its roughly 67,000 residents identify as Latino, census records show, with ties to countries including Bolivia, Colombia and Peru. On the east-side streets where many Latinos live, carts sell pineapple drinks under Spanish signs.\nTo the west is a bustling enclave of Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis, where shop windows display richly embroidered saris; about 20 percent of the non-Latino population is Asian, according to census data.\n\u201cEverybody is very accepting of everybody else here,\u201d said Larry Wilkes, a retired watch retailer in his 60s who bought his apartment, a one-bedroom in the postwar Southridge co-op, in 1992. Back then, one-bedrooms cost around $19,000, he said, and while prices barely budged for a decade, a one-bedroom in his complex recently sold for $165,000.\nMore families seem to be coming; Mr. Wilkes\u2019s co-op, where he is on the board, recently added a swing set and children\u2019s room as a result.\nAt the same time, retail rents seem to be going up, he said, which has led to a high turnover rate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an evolving neighborhood,\u201d Mr. Wilkes said. \u201cBut for what we pay, we\u2019re blessed.\u201d\nWhat You\u2019ll Find\nThe neighborhood is traditionally defined as bounded by Northern Boulevard, Junction Boulevard, Roosevelt Avenue and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, although some use \u201cJackson Heights\u201d to refer to a broader area.\nA historic district established in 1993 covers the core blocks, so the shimmering high-rises that have sprouted across the city in recent years are notably absent there.\nStanding under the elevated 7 train on busy, store-lined Roosevelt Avenue, you encounter shadows and din. If you walk a few steps into the neighborhood, though, hushed, sun-dappled streets quickly reveal themselves. And because the apartment buildings, which have Tudor and Second Empire touches, are slightly set back from the sidewalk, blocks don\u2019t feel cramped.\nAmong the most prized of the prewar co-ops is the Towers, at 81st Street and 34th Avenue, whose eight 1920s buildings, ringing a courtyard, take up a city block; apartments inside feature fireplaces with wooden mantels.\nSemidetached homes, a staple of Queens, also exist in Jackson Heights, though elegantly dressed up with multitoned slate roofs, shutters and driveway gates, to the point where they evoke English manors, such as on 87th Street, near 34th Avenue.\nAnd while glassy condos may be rare, there are still brick varieties, like Stratford Hall, on 35th Avenue, which converted from rentals a decade ago.\nWhat You\u2019ll Pay\nOn May 11, there were 48 properties for sale, according to data from StreetEasy.com, at an average price of $324,000.\nThough almost every listing was a co-op, at the high end was a 1925 three-bedroom attached house, with parquet floors, a renovated kitchen and a one-car garage, at $919,000. The least expensive was a co-op studio in a postwar brick elevator building, at $124,000, the data show.\nPrices have risen in recent years. In 2014, 501 co-ops, condos and single-family houses sold at an average of $276,000, according to StreetEasy. That was an increase of 8.2 percent over the average of $255,000 for the 479 listings sold in 2013.\nIn 2014, \u201cthe psychology among buyers was, we need to do something now,\u201d said Daniel Karatzas, an associate broker with Beaudoin Realty Group.\ntranscript\nNo script.\nAs for rentals, one-bedrooms range from around $1,400 to $1,800 a month and two-bedrooms from $1,900 to $2,400, listing data shows.\nWhat to Do\nStores crowd the streets at the neighborhood\u2019s edges but also along quaint 37th Avenue, where low-slung buildings house markets, bakeries and botanicas selling herbs.\nIn Little India, along 74th Street, the buffet at the Indian Taj restaurant was $10.95 at Sunday lunch recently. Plates were piled high with goat curry, chicken chili and saag paneer.\nAlso on Sunday, at Travers Park, on 78th Street, a  greenmarket offered yogurt, apples and hot dogs made from grass-fed beef.\nBecause the area can sometimes feel fragmented socially, Afzal Hossain, a resident and Bangladeshi immigrant, opened a cafe, Espresso 77, with his wife, Julie Nymann, that serves grilled cheese, panini and wraps. \u201cThere\u2019s already so much ethnic food here,\u201d he said.\nAbout 15 of the neighborhood\u2019s co-op gardens are scheduled to open their doors to the public on June 13, as part of an annual weekend celebrating the area\u2019s history sponsored by the Jackson Heights Beautification Group.\nThe Commute\nThe elevated 7 train along Roosevelt Avenue runs express at rush hours, with a stop at Junction Boulevard; the trip to Grand Central takes about 20 minutes.\nThe E, F, M and R subways also serve the busy Jackson Heights-Roosevelt Avenue station, with the E and F reaching Manhattan\u2019s East Side in about 15 minutes.\nThe Schools\nAmong the elementary schools serving the neighborhood are Public Schools 212, 149 and 69, which run through fifth grade.\nAt P.S. 69, 48 percent of students met standards in English on state exams last year, versus 30 percent citywide. In math, 53 percent met standards, versus 39 percent citywide.\nIntermediate Schools 145 and 230 teach sixth to eighth grades. At I.S. 230, 36 percent of students met standards in English on state exams last year, versus 27 percent citywide. In math, 53 percent met standards, versus 29 percent.\nThe History\nJackson Heights, known as Trains Meadow before the early 1900s, had its doubters. New York Mayor William Jay Gaynor dismissed a planned subway line there as a \u201ccornfield route.\u201d\nSome grassy areas endured for a time, like a golf course in the vicinity of 79th Street and 35th Avenue, but as the neighborhood grew more popular, it succumbed to Dunolly Gardens, a six-building Depression-era co-op.",

A searchable guide to these and many other art shows is at nytimes.com/events.\nMuseums\n\u2605 Brooklyn Museum: \u2018Kehinde Wiley: A New Republic\u2019 (through May 24) You can love or hate this artist\u2019s bright, brash, history-laden, kitsch-tinged portraits of confident, even imperious young black men and women usurping heroic roles from the generally lily-white history of Western painting. No matter, the two-decade survey of his extravagant, mind-teasing canvases rewards. His career seems to be one of ceaseless ambition, socially conscious generosity and an uncanny skill that he is still harnessing. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)\n\u2605 Brooklyn Museum: \u2018Judith Scott \u2014 Bound and Unbound\u2019  (through March 29) Judith Scott\u2019s mesmerizing sculptures sit like large, unopened bundles, contents mysterious, in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum. In a few, solid forms can be made out under wrappings of yarn, string and fabric strips; others suggest gift-wrapped boulders. You can call them abstract and stop there, or go further and connect them to art history, specifically the history of fiber art, or go further and consider them in the light of Ms. Scott\u2019s history: She was born in 1943 with Down syndrome, started making art only in her early 40s and kept making it until her death at 61. However approached, the work is complex and brilliant. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)\n\u2605 Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum (continuing) The stately doors of the 1902 Andrew Carnegie mansion, home to the Cooper Hewitt, are open again after an overhaul and expansion of the premises. Historic house and modern museum have always made an awkward fit, a standoff between preservation and innovation, and the problem remains, but the renovation has brought a wide-open new gallery space, a cafe and a raft of be-your-own-designer digital enhancements. Best of all, more of the museum\u2019s vast permanent collection is now on view, including an Op Art weaving, miniature spiral staircases, ballistic face masks and a dainty enameled 18th-century version of a Swiss knife. Like design itself, this institution is built on tumult and friction, and you feel it. 2 East 91st Street, at Fifth Avenue, 212-849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Cotter)\n\u2605 Drawing Center: \u2018Tomi Ungerer: All in One\u2019 (through March 22) This ambitious survey resurrects the French-born polymath \u201cdrawer\u201d (his word) who made a big splash in New York in the late 1950s and \u201960s before disappearing. But it skimps on his brilliant children\u2019s books and overindulges on his rather ordinary erotica. Feast on his childhood renderings of Nazis, his acerbic social cartoons and the amazing animations of the children\u2019s books. Savor the real thing in the gift shop. 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, 212-219-2166, drawingcenter.org. (Smith)\n\u2605 Guggenheim Museum: \u2018On Kawara \u2014 Silence\u2019  (through May 3) The first retrospective of this Conceptual Art giant turns the museum\u2019s spiral into a vortex suffused with the consciousness of time, life\u2019s supreme ruler, in all its quotidian daily unfoldings, historical events and almost incomprehensible grandeur. The presentation of date paintings, \u201cI Got Up\u201d postcards and \u201cI Am Still Alive\u201d telegrams echoes Mr. Kawara\u2019s exquisite sense of discipline and craft. This is an extraordinary tribute. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, 212-423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)\nInstitute for the Study of the Ancient World: \u2018From Ancient to Modern: Archaeology and Aesthetics\u2019 (through June 7) Small but bursting with ideas, this show tells a fascinating tale about the 20th-century excavation and interpretation of some ancient Sumerian artifacts. It focuses on about 50 objects that were unearthed in the 1920s and \u201930s in Mesopotamia, including sumptuous jewelry and wide-eyed, bearded men carved from stone. Along with these are profuse archaeological documentation; paintings and sculptures by 20th-century artists like Willem de Kooning and Henry Moore who were inspired by Sumerian art; and politically fraught works by two contemporary artists, Jananne al-Ani and Michael Rakowitz. Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, 15 East 84th Street, Manhattan, 212-992-7800, isaw.nyu.edu. (Ken Johnson)\n\u2605 Jewish Museum: \u2018Helena Rubinstein: Beauty Is Power\u2019 (through March 22) The first museum show devoted to the life and art collection of the cosmetics magnate Helena Rubinstein is a master class in modernism-as-marketing \u2014 one that comes with a strong female perspective on 20th-century visual culture. It shows us how Rubinstein adapted Cubism, Surrealism and other avant-garde art and design movements for her personal brand, highlighting new and different standards of beauty and exhorting women to control their own images through makeup and grooming. Mixing biography, business, art, fashion and d\u00e9cor, it recreates rooms from Rubinstein\u2019s salons and reassembles parts of her diverse collection, which included African, pre-Columbian and Oceanic artworks. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)\n\u2605 Metropolitan Museum of Art: \u2018Madame C\u00e9zanne\u2019  (through March 15) C\u00e9zanne\u2019s paintings of his wife, Hortense Fiquet, have long stumped would-be psychologists, offering few indications of intimacy or interior life. (The poet Rainer Maria Rilke, enthusing over \u201cMadame C\u00e9zanne in a Red Armchair,\u201d focused on the work\u2019s color scheme and called the chair \u201ca personality in its own right.\u201d) But assembled at the Met, and supported by more tender and informal graphite sketches, these portraits are more forthcoming. They suggest that numbing familiarity was actually, for C\u00e9zanne, a form of intimacy; that he could connect with portrait subjects only when they were as reliable a presence in his life as Mont Sainte-Victoire. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)\nMetropolitan Museum of Art: \u2018Making Pottery Art: The Robert A. Ellison Jr. Collection of French Ceramics (ca. 1880-1910)\u2019  (through March 15) Nearly all the 40 works in this show \u2014 from a collection recently donated to the museum \u2014 are in a traditional form of vases, bowls and platters. They represent a marvelous variety of styles and influences, including Art Nouveau, Arts and Crafts, classic Chinese traditions and European folk art. What they share is a love for processes and materials and a candid way with the human touch. Most intriguing of all is a curiously clunky small vase by Paul Gauguin, who might have been the George Ohr of European ceramics if he\u2019d stuck with it. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)\n\u2605 Metropolitan Museum of Art: \u2018Reimagining Modernism: 1900-1950\u2019 (continuing) One of the greatest encyclopedic museums in the world fulfills its mission a little more with an ambitious reinstallation of works of early European modernism with their American counterparts for the first time in nearly 30 years. Objects of design and paintings by a few self-taught artists further the integration. It is quite a sight, with interesting rotations and fine-tunings to come. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)\n\u2605 Metropolitan Museum of Art: \u2018Thomas Hart Benton\u2019s \u201cAmerica Today\u201d Mural Rediscovered\u2019 (through April 19) The prickly American Regionalist Thomas Hart Benton had his share of detractors. But even they would probably acknowledge that his early mural \u201cAmerica Today\u201d is the best of its kind, a raucous, cartwheeling, wide-angle look at 1920s America that set the standard for the Works Progress Administration\u2019s mural program and has remained a New York City treasure. Now installed at the Met in a reconstruction of its original setting (a boardroom at the New School for Social Research), it captivates with period details (from the cut of a flapper gown to the mechanics of a blast furnace) and timely signs of socioeconomic and environmental distress (exhausted coal miners and hands reaching for coffee and bread). 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)\n\u2605 Metropolitan Museum of Art: \u2018Warriors and Mothers: Epic Mbembe Art\u2019 (through Sept. 7) If a dozen masterpiece Renaissance sculptures, done in an unknown and wildly unorthodox style, suddenly turned up in the Italian countryside, the find would make the news. You\u2019ll encounter the equivalent of such a discovery in this show of spectacular weatherworn, wood-carved figures, some dating to before the 17th century, that were made by the Mbeme in southeastern Nigeria and taken to Paris by an African dealer in the early 1970s. They caused a sensation among collectors and scholars at the time, and you can see why. But the effort to find more of them proved fruitless. The examples at the Met, which include the original dozen, represent all the fully intact stand-alone Mbembe figures known to exist. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)\nMoMA PS1: \u2018Bob and Roberta Smith: Art Amnesty\u2019 (through March 23) Bob and Roberta Smith is the cognomen of a British artist who specializes in humorously mocking art institutions and the conventional attitudes they tend to promulgate. The ostensible idea of this show is to give people an opportunity to officially retire from making art and to ceremonially discard works of art they own but no longer want. Unloaded works are displayed along with jazzy signs painted by Mr. Smith on all kinds of surfaces. One proclaims, \u201cJoseph Beuys conclusive proof not everyone is an artist.\u201d 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, 718-784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)\nMoMA PS1: \u2018Samara Golden: The Flat Side of the Knife\u2019 (through Sept. 7) Standing at a railing where you look into the museum\u2019s two-story-tall Duplex Gallery, you behold a confoundingly complicated interior architecture with furniture, stairways, musical instruments, wheelchairs and many other domestic items rendered in silvery, foil-clad foam board. The gallery\u2019s floor is covered by a grid of large mirrors so that everything is doubled. What you think is up may really be down and what you take to be real might be a virtual reflection of the real. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, 718-784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)\n\u2605 Museum of Biblical Art: \u2018Sculpture in the Age of Donatello: Renaissance Masterpieces From Florence Cathedral\u2019 (through June 14) This terrific 23-piece show features three major works by the early Renaissance sculptor Donatello (1386-1466), including the life-size statue of a bald prophet known as \u201clo Zuccone\u201d or \u201cPumpkin Head,\u201d which is widely considered the sculptor\u2019s greatest work. Along with a half-dozen other works by or attributed to Donatello are sculptures by Nanni di Banco (circa 1386-1421), Donatello\u2019s main competitor, including his monumental representation in marble of St. Luke. With the addition of a series of octagonal marble reliefs by Luca della Robbia and wooden models of the Florence Cathedral\u2019s enormous dome attributed to its designer, Filippo Brunelleschi, the exhibition amounts to a tightly cropped snapshot of the birth of the Renaissance. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, 212-408-1500, mobia.org. (Johnson)\n\u2605 Museum of Modern Art: \u2018The Forever Now: Contemporary Painting in an Atemporal World\u2019 (through April 5) Despite being predictable and market-oriented in its choice of 17 artists, this museum\u2019s first painting survey in decades is well worth seeing. About half the artists are exceptional and the rest are represented by their best work. Based on the premise that all historical painting styles are equally available today, the exhibition has been smartly installed to juxtapose different approaches: figurative and abstract, digital and handmade, spare and opulent. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)\n\u2605 Museum of Modern Art: \u2018Jean Dubuffet: Soul of the Underground\u2019 (through April 5) \u201cLook at what lies at your feet!\u201d Jean Dubuffet wrote in a 1957 essay. \u201cA crack in the ground, sparkling gravel, a tuft of grass, some crushed debris, offer equally worthy subjects for your applause and admiration.\u201d In MoMA\u2019s stimulating show, drawn entirely from its collection, we can see how Dubuffet\u2019s earthbound gaze nourished his reinvention of the painted surface. On view are several canvases smeared with a mixture of oil, putty, sand and gravel, some of them with incised drawings that seem to equate painting with plowing. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)\n\u2605 Museum of Modern Art: \u2018Modern Photographs from the Thomas Walther Collection, 1909-1949\u2019 (through April 19) Overflowing with prints by Berenice Abbott, Andre Kertesz, Edward Weston and other luminaries from the first half of the 20th century, this exhibition would seem to be a straightforward look at photography\u2019s past. But the show, packaged with a book, a symposium and an engrossing interactive website, is really a bold attempt to visualize the future of photography inside the museum as it reckons with the unwieldy, image-saturated culture outside the galleries. With works by Aleksandr Rodchenko, Ms. Abbott, Alvin Langdon Coburn and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy that explore cities from unusual angles or abstract their infrastructure, the show\u2019s largest section, \u201cDynamics of the City,\u201d best encapsulates the Walther Collection\u2019s distinctly urban, peripatetic take on Modernism. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)\nMuseum of Modern Art: \u2018The Paris of Toulouse-Lautrec: Prints and Posters\u2019 (through March 22) In his printed works, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec chronicled and publicized the music halls, theaters, circuses, operas and cafes of Paris with terrific verve, sly wit and surprising subtlety. This enthralling show presents approximately 100 examples drawn from the museum\u2019s permanent collection. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)\n\u2605 Neue Galerie: \u2018Egon Schiele: Portraits\u2019 (through April 20) Of the approximately 125 items in this terrific show, there are only 11 oil paintings, which is a good thing. Except for a large picture of his wife, Edith, in a colorful striped dress, Schiele\u2019s works on canvas are dark and turgid. But his drawings are nimble and nuanced. Working on paper with pencil, charcoal, ink, gouache, watercolor and crayons, he portrayed himself and others with infectious avidity. There\u2019s hardly a single sheet here that doesn\u2019t warrant close looking for its virtuoso draftsmanship and psychological acuity. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, 212-628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Johnson)\n\u2605 New Museum: \u2018Surround Audience: 2015 Triennial\u2019 (through May 24) If you\u2019re fed up with big joke-shop sculpture, diva spectacle and brain-dead abstraction, this museum\u2019s 2015 Triennial will come as a break in the clouds \u2014 not a full flood of new light, but a pull in a different direction. It\u2019s a glimpse of terrain composed almost entirely of border crossings in media, art disciplines, ethnicities, genders and species. The in-between as an aesthetic is no surprise given the curators: Lauren Cornell of the New Museum, who has been paying astute attention to digital art and the Internet for years, and the artist Trecartin, whose laptop-generated, YouTube-distributed, hourslong pop-epic videos add up to some of the most thoroughly genre-collapsing art of the past decade. If nothing by the 51 artists from 25 countries is as genius as his work, there is still a lot to ponder in a show that represents a welcome shift to microgravity flux within a gross-objects industry. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, 212-219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Cotter)\n\u2605 New-York Historical Society: \u2018Freedom Journey 1965: Photographs of the Selma to Montgomery March by Stephen Somerstein\u2019 (through April 19) Almost 50 years ago, the picture editor of a campus newspaper at City College of New York assigned himself a breaking story: covering what promised to be a massive march in Alabama, led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., to demand free-and-clear voting rights for African-Americans. On short notice the editor, Stephen Somerstein, grabbed his cameras, climbed on a bus and headed south. The 55 pictures of black leaders and everyday people in this show, installed in a hallway and small gallery, are some that he shot that day. The image of Dr. King\u2019s head seen in monumental silhouette that has become a virtual logo of the film \u201cSelma\u201d is based on a Somerstein original. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Cotter)\n\u2605 Rubin Museum of Art: \u2018The All-Knowing Buddha: A Secret Guide\u2019 (through April 13) This show presents 54 paintings that illustrate step-by-step instructions for followers of Tibetan Buddhism. Delicately painted on 10-by-10-inch paper sheets, most of the pages depict a monk having fabulous visions in a verdant landscape. Thought to have been commissioned by a Mongolian patron and executed by unidentified artists in a Chinese workshop sometime in the 18th century, it is a fascinating and remarkably thorough manual for seekers of higher consciousness. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, 212-620-5000, rubinmuseum.org. (Johnson)\nSculpture Center: \u2018Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook\u2019  (through March 30) A pre-eminent artist in Southeast Asia, this Thai video maker addresses topics like death, the insane, East-West cultural differences, the disenfranchisement of women and the rights of animals, often in provocatively discomfiting ways. In a set of three videos, she gives professorial lectures about death to sets of real human corpses. Many of her most recent works have to do with dogs. In them, she protests the abuse of dogs and hints at a holistic vision of people in tune with nature and the cosmos. 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, 718-361-1750, sculpture-center.org. (Johnson)\nGalleries: Chelsea\n\u2018The New York School, 1969: Henry Geldzahler at the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019 (through March 14) This show revisits a large groundbreaking exhibition in 1969 organized by the Met\u2019s first curator of 20th-century art. Its radiant works evoke the big-name movers and shakers of Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art and Minimalism, while also representing art history as unquestioningly orderly, monolithic and male. Paul Kasmin, 293 10th Avenue, 212-563-4474, paulkasmingallery.com. (Smith)\nGalleries: Other\n\u2018The Gee\u2019s Bend Tradition\u2019 (through April 24) A show of 14 quilts by seven artists, all made since 1990, and an accompanying exhibition of photographs, demonstrates what makes the Gee\u2019s Bend tradition so compelling. Unlike most quilts in the European-American tradition, which favored uniformity, harmony and precision, Gee\u2019s Bend quilts, made by generations of African-American women, include wild, improvisatory elements: broken patterns, high color contrasts, asymmetry and syncopation. They came into being alongside gospel, blues and jazz. The photographs document how the quilts are historically linked to slavery, Depression-era politics and the Civil Rights Movement, and the rich landscape in which they germinated and thrived.

(Martha Schwendener)\nPublic Art\n\u2018Archeo\u2019 (through March) Shortening the word archaeology, this exhibition focuses on technology and obsolescence. Marianne Vitale\u2019s sculptures made from steel components of railroad switches known as frogs are one highlight; Jessica Jackson Hutchins\u2019s neo-hippie assemblages with found ceramics and a hand-woven hammock another. Across the bar from the Standard Hotel, Josh Kline takes the most activist stance, with smoothies made from prescription drugs and consumer products, while a mural by the veteran artist Ed Ruscha \u2014 a new commission separate from \u201cArcheo\u201d \u2014 announces \u201cHoney, I Twisted Through More Damn Traffic Today,\u201d perhaps capturing the ethos of the tourist-clogged High Line.

(Schwendener)\nOut of Town\n\u2605 National Museum of African Art: \u2018Conversations: African and African American Artists in Dialogue\u2019  (through early 2016) For its 50th anniversary, this museum has brilliantly thread together work from two sources: its own holdings in African material and the Camille O. and William H. Cosby Jr. collection of African-American art. The Cosby collection, weighted toward canonical figures like Romare Bearden and Charles White, will bring in the crowds, but it is the curators and museum itself, which is in a period of renaissance, that have made the show rise well above predictability.

(Cotter)\nPennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts: \u2018Peter Blume: Nature and Metamorphosis\u2019 (through April 5) Though not well-known today, Blume (1906-92) was a famous American artist during the 1930s and \u201940s. For many years his painting \u201cThe Eternal City\u201d (1934-37) was one of the most memorable artworks displayed in the permanent collection galleries of the Museum of Modern Art. A weird, technically dazzling mix of Magic and Social Realism that envisioned Rome under the Fascist reign of Mussolini, it\u2019s among the highlights of this exhibition of more than 150 works dating from 1924 to 1990. 128 North Broad Street, Philadelphia, 215-972-7600, pafa.org. (Johnson)\nLast Chance\nAmerican Folk Art Museum: \u2018A Shared Legacy: Folk Art in America\u2019  (closes on Sunday) Drawn from a private collection, this beguiling show presents more than 60 choice objects including paintings, drawings, sculptures, furniture, painted chests and knickknacks made from 1800 to 1920. Altogether they embody a paradox for modern viewers: They evoke a world and a way of life that modernity has eclipsed, and yet they feel as vivid as anything you might desire in the art of today. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, 212-595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Johnson)\nJames Benning and Peter Hutton (through Thursday) Three slow, beautiful installations of moving images include Mr. Benning\u2019s \u201cTulare Road\u201d (2010), which was shot digitally but has repeating segments. Mr. Hutton\u2019s three-channel installations were shot on 16-millimeter film and transferred to video. Deep-hued and expertly composed, the films are also subtle commentaries on labor and globalization. There is footage of a ship being constructed in Korea, images taken from a ship at sea and film of workers demolishing freighters in Bangladesh \u2014 and at Orchard Street, three different forms of industry: salt miners in arid Ethiopia, farmers in the verdant Hudson Valley and repairmen in a familiarly bleak Detroit. All three exhibit a mastery of the moving picture that is arresting, instructive and impressive.

(Schwendener)\n\u2605 Dia:Beacon: \u2018Carl Andre: Sculpture as Place, 1958-2010\u2019 (closes on Monday) Minimalism was the late-20th century\u2019s great hope for a heroic American art on the Abstract Expressionism model. Mr. Andre was one of Minimalism\u2019s founders. This career survey of his low-to-the-ground modular sculptures looks terrific in Dia\u2019s sonorous, sunlight-washed spaces. It also poses the question of how such monument-minded art can feel so modest, intimate \u2014 even delicate. The real treat here is the chance to see dozens of manuscript pages of Mr. Andre\u2019s 1960s poems, which he referred to as \u201ctypewriter drawings.\u201d Carefully shaped on the page in lines and blocks, they are evidence of a sculptor-to-be at work. 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., 845-440-0100, diaart.org.

(He\u2019s also the co-owner of the Chelsea gallery Algus Greenspon, which continues.) And as always, he\u2019s highlighting substantial but under-recognized artists of an earlier day. The painter Agustin Fernandez was born in Cuba in 1928, studied art and philosophy there (he was a classmate of Fidel Castro), and had a cosmopolitan career at home and abroad. His expertly painted mix of abstraction and surrealism ended up being out of step with new art in New York, where he died in 2006, but looks remarkably fresh in the context of current styles of morphing digital realism.

(Cotter)\n\u2605 \u2018Foot Notes: On the Sensations of Tone\u2019 (closes on Saturday) This marvelous small show of sound art, organized by Alastair Noble, requires some time to take in, and is worth every minute spent. You\u2019ll travel two aural voyages: across the North Sea in a myth-tinged narrative recorded on video and LP by Chris Watson and Robert Macfarlane, and down the Housatonic River, its length traced entirely in field recordings of water, weather and bird sounds. And you spend an hour of pure, natural magic with the clarinetist David Rothenberg as he stands in a field creating a collaborative song cycle with cicadas. Other magicians on hand are Ed Osborn, the team of Una Lee and Chris H. Lynn, and the deep listeners and pulse-whisperers George Quasha and Chuck Stein.

Based on an imaginary cult, \u201cThe Empathics,\u201d Ms. Woolfalk\u2019s show adeptly extends the genre of Afro-futurism, which includes the music of Sun Ra and George Clinton and the sci-fi novels of Samuel Delany and Octavia Butler.

    "text": "Saving the World, Startup-Style\n2015-11-17T12:00:03.000Z\nIn 2010, not long after the earthquake hit Haiti, I was about an hour north of Port-au-Prince, standing under a mango tree. Its owner, a woman named Jelen, was telling me that she had two daughters but could afford to send only one to school. She knew this meant the other would be poor, like her, for the rest of her life. She said she was choosing the younger one because she was smarter. She then pointed at her mango tree. It was huge, bigger than a family home, and grew hundreds of mangoes each year. She knew that those mangoes could sell for several dollars each in America, but there was no easy way to get them there. So she sold most of them down the road at a local market for pennies. If she could find a good way to get those mangoes down the highway to the capital and then on a ship to America, she was confident that she could make enough money to send both her girls to school.\nI remember feeling almost giddy as she told me this story. Jelen was about to get her wish. I knew that the American government, working with one of Haiti\u2019s leading mango exporters, was funding a project to help everyday Haitians like her ship their mangoes to America.\nFive years later, farmers like Jelen are still waiting. I hadn\u2019t heard wrong: The United States Agency for International Development (U.S.A.I.D.) did indeed promise to fund such an effort. The idea was part of its mission to improve the supply chain of poor farmers by helping them prepare their food for sale long distances away. But just before sheds and a well were constructed, someone in Washington shifted U.S.A.I.D.\u2019s primary goals in Haiti, and the project was canceled.\nThe story of Jelen and her mangoes is the story of the failure of American and world aid to help poor people in other countries. The United States government spends about $30 billion a year toward this end, while the rest of the world\u2019s governments spend an additional $100 billion combined. Since World War II, that adds up to trillions spent on foreign aid. But global development agencies, like U.S.A.I.D. and the World Bank, have had trouble figuring out whether the money they spend actually makes poor people better off. For decades, grand theories were developed in rich countries about how to alleviate poverty, and huge amounts of money were spent, with stunningly little regard for their actual impact. There was the big-push model, the dual-sector model, the critical minimum effort, the Fei-Ranis surplus-labor model, capital accumulation, capacity building and, widely adopted and then thoroughly repudiated, the Washington Consensus. Each theory promised an elegant, compelling solution to world poverty. Each has fallen short, in many cases making poor people worse off.\nDuring the past decade, there has been a quiet revolution in the way many scholars and advocates think about aid. We can call it the post-theory approach. The idea is that rich countries shouldn\u2019t see themselves as responsible for coming up with theories about how poor countries can become richer. Rather, the rich countries allow the poor ones to determine what they think needs to happen \u2014 more girls in school, more vaccination, better access to global markets for farmers \u2014 and then pay money to whoever comes up with an actual solution. There are many versions of this approach. Under one idea, cash-on-delivery aid, donors would set aside some amount and then pay, say, $10 for every child who gets a vaccine shot. Governments, nonprofits and private-sector companies can compete on who can do this best. Development-impact bonds are another new idea. Private investors put their money at risk to achieve certain outcomes, like a lower H.I.V.-infection rate or cleaner water, and are paid back only if the projects they fund actually achieve their goals. The idea is that government money is spent only when an outcome is achieved, improving lives for the poor while saving taxpayers wasted expenses.\nBut most governments and large aid organizations are still doling out billions of dollars based on insufficient data. One of U.S.A.I.D.\u2019s most prominent metrics seems like a relic from the 1950s. Called Dollars to Results, it simply counts how much money has been spent toward various goals: $7.2 million to help Cambodia improve its environment; $6.6 million to help Bangladeshi children go to school. There is minimal information about what actually matters, like whether Cambodia\u2019s environment is measurably better or if Bangladesh\u2019s children know more. And of course, when goals fall out of favor \u2014 like how to best manage a supply chain in Haiti \u2014 worthy projects can be scuttled in an instant.\nI have no idea if, even given continuous support, Jelen\u2019s mangoes would ever be commercially successful on the global market. But studying the broader economy, I do know that this is no way to find out. For a good chunk of the 20th century, much of American business worked the way U.S.A.I.D. often does. Someone at headquarters would lay out a three-year or a five-year plan, and then the minions would fall in line. But that model was discarded long ago. Business schools and corporate executives now talk about learning organizations, adaptive leadership, continuous improvement and lean start-ups, i.e., companies that are designed to respond constantly to markers of success or failure. They set up systems to pour resources into those projects that are working and away from those that aren\u2019t.\nBy contemporary management standards, even the new data-driven efforts at philanthropy feel a little bit hidebound. Whatever you think of Silicon Valley, the venture-capital philosophy of investing can be an extremely useful model for philanthropy in its confident embrace of risk. In V.C.-backed fields, new ideas start out with minimal funding and, as they prove themselves, attract greater and greater sums. An individual or institution can kick in a so-called angel investment, of $50,000 or maybe up to $2 million, with the knowledge that most will not be home runs. The ideas that prove themselves in the market move to larger rounds, funded by folks whose appetite for risk is somewhat smaller but who are prepared to give more, say from $2 million to $10 million; they expect perhaps six out of every 10 investments to succeed. And so on. At each stage, the ideas need to be less risky, more proven. And the ideas are shaped themselves by this process as they are continually tested against reality to see which ones work and which don\u2019t.\nAlex Thier, head of policy at U.S.A.I.D., told me the agency has begun to experiment with such programs through its Global Development Lab. Moreover, he said, the agency is now making it a priority that poor recipient countries should play a much bigger role in deciding how aid money is spent. A vast majority of American and world aid, however, is still delivered according to wildly outdated models. It often seems designed to help American foreign-policy goals as much as the poor, disproportionately going to geopolitically important countries \u2014 Afghanistan, Iraq, Jordan, Pakistan. Also, there is a powerful political system supporting the ways aid is allocated. For example, lobbyists for American farmers and shipowners have kept in place an absurd law that requires much of the emergency food aid sent to crisis-racked countries to come from American farms and be carried by American ships.\nThere\u2019s still some hope for farmers like Jelen to export their mangoes to America. The United States government now has a global program called Feed the Future, but many local farmers are still waiting to see if their mangoes will qualify. All told, they\u2019ve spent less time expanding their businesses than they have navigating the bureaucracy of the American government.",

(SOUNDBITE) (English) AUSTRALIAN IMMIGRATION MINISTER, PETER DUTTON, SAYING:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue the negotiations because there is good faith on both sides and if we can strike an agreement that is in the best interests of our country and from the Philippines\u2019 perspective, their country, we will arrive at that point.\u201d\nMr. Dutton declined to provide details of the possible plan. The newspaper The Australian, which earlier reported news of the discussions, said it could cost Australia more than 150 million Australian dollars, or $108 million, citing unidentified government officials.\nThe Philippines\u2019 foreign affairs secretary, Albert F. del Rosario, met with Ms. Bishop on the sidelines of the General Assembly and discussed \u201cirregular migration and migrants in distress,\u201d among other issues, according to a Philippine statement last week.\nAustralia refuses to accept asylum seekers who try to reach its shores by boat, and it has sent hundreds to detention centers on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea and the tiny Pacific island nation of Nauru. Australia says the policy has helped reduce the number of people attempting the risky sea voyage. But advocates for refugees say that the detainees are being held in harsh and dangerous conditions and that they should not be shunted onto other developing nations.\nThe Cambodia plan, under which Australia pledged $29 million in aid in return for Cambodia\u2019s accepting refugees from Nauru, has been criticized as a waste of money. Few asylum seekers expressed interest in relocating to the impoverished Southeast Asian nation, and Cambodia said recently that it was not eager to accept any more.\nA Philippine advocacy group, Bayan, called on President Benigno S. Aquino III to reveal specifics of the negotiations with Australia. \u201cIt is just shameful that a developed nation like Australia would refuse these refugees and instead move to have them relocated to a struggling, developing country like the Philippines,\u201d said the group\u2019s secretary general, Renato M. Reyes Jr.\nThis week, Australia\u2019s High Court heard a legal challenge to the offshore detention policy, filed on behalf of a detainee from Bangladesh who had been sent from Nauru to Australia for medical treatment. Advocates want to prevent the government from sending her, along with about 200 other people who received treatment in Australia, back to Manus and Nauru. It is unclear when the court will issue a ruling.\nSeveral cases of women who reported they had been raped on Nauru have also captured national attention in Australia, spurring further criticism of the detention program. One of the women is pregnant and says she wants to travel to Australia for an abortion, and an Iranian asylum seeker said to have been gang raped on Nauru in May is being treated in a hospital in Brisbane.\nAn Australian Senate report in August documented testimony about dangerous conditions at the Nauru center. This week, Nauru said that it was easing rules to allow the people being held there 24-hour freedom of movement and that it would process all of the more than 600 outstanding asylum claims within a week. A Nauru official told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Thursday that as many as 200 of those claims might not be completed in that time, however.",

    "text": "\u2018The Upstairs Wife,\u2019 by Rafia Zakaria\n2015-03-27T11:51:02.000Z\nIn the mid-1950s, when the Pakistani prime minister Mohammad Ali Bogra falls in love with his secretary, it occurs to him that according to the Islamic principles on which his country is governed, he would be legally within his rights should he take a second (or even a third and fourth) wife. What he doesn\u2019t calculate, however, are the social consequences of bigamy. His decision to remarry so infuriates his first wife, Hamida Bogra, that she initiates a women\u2019s rights campaign calling for reforms in marriage law.\nHamida Bogra\u2019s agitation results in the passage of the Muslim Family Law Ordinance of 1961. Though the statute secures nominal marital protections for women, it fails to ban polygamy or allow women to initiate divorce. So 25 years later, when the writer Rafia Zakaria\u2019s Uncle Sohail falls in love with an officemate in Karachi, there is nothing to stop him from following in the footsteps of the former prime minister. Privately devastated and publicly humiliated, his first wife, Amina, moves back into her father\u2019s home in defeat. Zakaria, then only 10, is perplexed: \u201cI had never known that a man could have two wives.\u201d\nBowing to the pressure of community elders, Aunt Amina eventually returns to her husband\u2019s home, where she lives on the top floor while the second wife occupies the ground floor. \u201cThe arrangement when one man had to be shared by two women was methodical, inspired by the Quranic prescription that asked every man taking more than one woman to do so only if he could do \u2018perfect justice\u2019 between them,\u201d Zakaria explains. Aunt Amina and her rival agree to spend alternate weeks with their husband. The household is an \u201coddity\u201d; no other man on the lane has two wives. In their neighbors\u2019 homes, \u201c\u2018Is Sohail upstairs or downstairs tonight?\u2019 always managed to draw a laugh from the most harried of housewives, the most overworked of husbands,\u201d Zakaria writes.\n\u201cThe Upstairs Wife\u201d unfolds incrementally: Every new scene in Amina and Sohail\u2019s marriage is paired with a scene from Pakistani history. There is often a wry elegance to these pairings. The original marriage proposal to Aunt Amina from Uncle Sohail comes within days of Pakistan\u2019s forfeiture of East Pakistan (Bangladesh), what Zakaria calls \u201cthe first and only public surrender in modern military history\u201d; the year that a distraught Aunt Amina returns to her father\u2019s house, Benazir Bhutto returns to her father\u2019s home, too, after seven years of self-imposed exile from Pakistan. Zakaria juxtaposes private dreams and divisions against public ones to powerful effect. Aunt Amina may be the only woman on the lane who has to share her husband, but she is hardly the only woman struggling to accept the \u201cperfect justice\u201d accorded her under Pakistani law.\nThe main drawback to this narrative technique is the fragmentation it creates. Zakaria\u2019s historic interludes aren\u2019t consistently chronological and don\u2019t always neatly parallel events in her story; while many of the incidents she highlights from Pakistan\u2019s past function as sharp illustrations of systemic discrimination against women, not all do. Others briefly draw attention to the assorted forces that shaped the country between 1947 and 2007, the year Benazir Bhutto was assassinated: waves of migration, sectarian conflict, a series of military coups, political violence, Cold War tensions, wars with India, wars in Afghanistan, the 9/11 attacks and so on. There\u2019s no single through-line here. Zakaria\u2019s selection of historical episodes raises several books\u2019 worth of unaddressed questions.\nAlso left unaddressed is Zakaria\u2019s personal story. In the family home, \u201cthe windows of the upstairs bedroom from which Amina first saw Sohail became mine,\u201d she writes, and it\u2019s evident from the sensory details she lavishes on the story that her aunt\u2019s fate was, from an early age, a subject of deep personal concern. But how, specifically, might it have shaped her own adult outlook and choices? In the epilogue, Zakaria refers in passing to rebelling from an arranged marriage of her own. \u201cMy story was built on hers,\u201d she says of the beloved aunt whose window she inherited. Zakaria, who is a columnist for the Pakistani newspaper Dawn, Al Jazeera America and others, and is a member of Amnesty International USA\u2019s board of directors, has clearly forged a path very different from her aunt\u2019s. But what is her own story, and the story of a generation of Pakistani women like her \u2014 the little girls who grew up at the feet of Aunt Aminas everywhere? That, too, might be a question for another book.\nThese omissions are worth mentioning only because \u201cThe Upstairs Wife\u201d does manage to cover so much ground so skillfully, casting a sharp eye on complicated personal politics and affairs of state alike. In the end, Zakaria discovers how deeply entangled her family\u2019s fate is with that of her country. Together they are \u201cknotted and inextricable, inside and outside, male and female, no longer separate.\u201d",

    "text": "You Think Your Winter Was Rough?\n2015-03-05T08:21:29.000Z\nIn October, two young Americans set off on the most daring and foolhardy wilderness expedition since, oh, maybe Lewis and Clark.\nThey were trying to become the first people ever to backpack from Canada to Mexico on the Pacific Crest Trail in the dead of winter. Once before, in 1983, two people set out to traverse the trail in winter. They never made it. Their bodies were found a month after they fell off an icy cliff.\nA winter thru-hike of the Pacific Crest Trail seemed impossible. The trail is covered by many feet of snow that time of year, and, even if the two explorers managed to find their way, they risked triggering avalanches, plunging through ice into rivers, or simply running out of food while trapped in blizzards.\n\u201cPeople said it was a death sentence,\u201d Shawn Forry, one of the hikers, told me. He had estimated half-jokingly at the start that they had a 17 percent chance of succeeding.\nBut he spoke to me shortly after he and Justin Lichter reached the Mexican border on Sunday, completing their 2,650-mile odyssey \u2014 and surviving frostbite, blizzards, tumbles into frozen rivers and 1,750 consecutive trail miles without encountering a single other hiker.\nPerhaps it feels a little self-indulgent to celebrate two guys who took a long walk. But what a walk! Like the 4-minute mile or the free climb of the Dawn Wall at Yosemite, this is something that seemed beyond human capacity \u2014 and then humans did it.\nSo let\u2019s take a break from current affairs and recriminations about human venality to laud a triumph of human strength.\nIt helped that the two men were enormously experienced. Forry is a wilderness instructor for Outward Bound. Lichter works on a ski patrol and said he has hiked 35,000 miles, equivalent to nearly one and a half times around Earth. He gave up one long backpack across East Africa when lions were stalking him. \nBoth Forry and Lichter had hiked the entire Pacific Crest Trail in summer \u2014 itself an ultimate test of endurance (fewer people have thru-hiked the full trail than have climbed Mount Everest). But they wanted to see it in another season.\n\u201cWith the snow, there\u2019s so much natural beauty,\u201d Lichter said. \u201cIt\u2019s so peaceful. And the frozen rivers have these strange ice formations.\u201d\nThey used snowshoes and, in California, skis, while carrying loads of up to 45 pounds, including food (they resupplied every week or so). Winter storms were frequent. When it snowed at night, they would get up every 30 minutes to push snow off their tarp to keep it from collapsing on them. In white-outs, they could barely see and stayed close to each other \u2014 except when crossing avalanche zones, when they had to separate to ensure that they would not both get buried in the same avalanche.\nEven drinking water was a challenge. \u201cYou\u2019re surrounded by frozen water, but you don\u2019t have easy access to it to drink,\u201d Forry said. They used a stove to melt snow for drinking water.\nThe worst period, they said, came in the Oregon mountains when a huge snowfall and below-zero temperatures left them with frostbitten feet. They were able to warm up and avoid permanent damage, yet they still had another 2,000 miles to go.\n\u201cAt times, you\u2019re pulling your knee up to your chest to take the next step, to get it above the snow \u2014 and that\u2019s in snowshoes,\u201d Forry said.\nBarney Mann, the chairman of the Pacific Crest Trail Association and unofficial historian of the trail, said that after the frostbite incident he had doubted that Forry and Lichter would succeed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the unrelenting cold,\u201d Mann said. \u201cIt\u2019s the unrelenting snow. It\u2019s the moment-by-moment challenge of navigation when everything is white.\u201d\nOne difficult day came in northern California when a storm dropped 10 inches of rain in 24 hours, winds reached 70 miles per hour and both men tumbled into a swollen torrent of a river that left them and their gear drenched and frigid.\nYet, in spite of all those challenges, they still urge people to try winter camping \u2014 carefully.\n\u201cI really encourage people to get out in the winter,\u201d Forry said. \u201cYou have it to yourself, and it\u2019s so peaceful. But start with a day trip \u2014 that way if anything goes wrong, you\u2019re near your car.\u201d\n\u0095\nI\u2019m delighted to announce that the winner of my annual win-a-trip contest is Austin Meyer, a journalism student at Stanford University. We\u2019ll probably travel to India and Bangladesh, although Congo is an alternate possibility. The runners-up are Ashley Bastock of John Carroll University, Taylor Graham of Ithaca College and Sam Friedlander of University of Pennsylvania. Thanks to the Center for Global Development for helping me pick Austin from a dazzling field of 450 applicants. Stay tuned for a great reporting trip! ",

    "text": "Even in Safety of Malaysia, Rohingya Migrants Face Bleak Prospects\n2015-06-03T12:51:41.000Z\nAMPANG, Malaysia \u2014 For refugees from Myanmar who have reached Malaysia, life may well be better than the grim marginalization and persecution they fled. But even here, poverty and exclusion threaten to rob them of a voice in determining their own future.\nThe boatloads of Rohingya migrants who landed here desperate and exhausted last month join some 75,000 Rohingya who made their way to Malaysia years and even decades before. Judging by the hardships their forerunners face, it will be difficult for the latest wave either to establish a secure foothold or to achieve resettlement elsewhere.\n\u201cFrom a country, we have become stateless, and as refugees, we have become stateless again,\u201d said Mohammed Noor, the managing director of Rohingya Vision TV, an online news service based in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital. \u201cWe\u2019re a floating people now, floating everywhere without any hope, without any papers.\u201d\nPrayers and speeches here on Wednesday marked the third anniversary of the bloodshed in Myanmar that started the latest exodus, but in the larger regional debate over their future, the Rohingya have largely been left as muted bystanders.\nIn Malaysia, their status as refugees and unregistered migrants bars them from sending their children to government schools, meaning many receive little or no education. They are also barred from holding jobs legally, but necessity compels most of the men to find menial off-the-books labor.\n\u201cDecades of policies in Myanmar have left many Rohingya illiterate and impoverished, and that\u2019s hard to shake off as refugees,\u201d said Gerhard Hoffstaedter, an anthropologist from the University of Queensland in Australia who studies the Rohingya and other refugee groups in Malaysia.\nEchoing the views of other experts and Rohingya leaders and organizers in Malaysia, Dr. Hoffstaedter said that many of the refugees\u2019 problems were partly rooted in their own society.\nThe Rohingya \u201clack the organization and rich networks that other, more successful refugee groups can tap,\u201d he said. He noted that the Chin, another migrant group from Myanmar, have been more successful at setting up schools and at securing resettlement in third countries, especially the United States.\n\u201cThe Rohingya have an amazing capacity for suffering, but they\u2019ve been given so few stories of success,\u201d he said.\nEven so, compared with the bamboo shacks and fetid detention camps they left behind, Malaysia offers at least some modicum of hope and opportunity, if not the kinder reception, decent jobs and schools, and swift resettlement that many hoped for.\nThe Rohingya have managed to establish enclaves in several neighborhoods on the edges of Kuala Lumpur, the capital, living in concrete housing blocks and shopping in open-air markets. Here in the Ampang district, tens of thousands of Rohingya crowd into apartments and dilapidated houses that often hold several families each.\nMany Rohingya men find occasional work on construction sites or in cheap restaurants in the city, and some women work in stalls and shops. In the Selayang neighborhood, hundreds of Rohingya stall holders sell fruit and vegetables, mixing with other poor migrants, including many from Myanmar.\n\u201cWe are not rich people, but this is better than what we left behind,\u201d said Mohammed Ayub, a Rohingya who has lived in Malaysia for three years and runs a tailor shop in Taman Muda on the edge of Kuala Lumpur. \u201cWhat is most important is that we have some security here. We don\u2019t have much, but we have some security.\u201d\nMost pressing of all, many migrants said they faced a long, uncertain wait for the United Nations refugee agency office in Kuala Lumpur to accredit them as refugees, which would entitle them to a precious identity card that many see as their best protection against detention or abuse by officials and the police.\nAbout 25,000 migrants left Myanmar and Bangladesh on rickety smugglers\u2019 boats in the first three months of 2015, according to a United Nations estimate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to get the U.N. card,\u201d said Ambiya Kadahusan, a 21-year-old Rohingya who said she applied nearly a year ago and had yet to receive a response. \u201cWithout a card, we feel it\u2019s unsafe to go out and look for work, or even visit friends.\n\u201cThe police check: \u2018Where are you from? Are you a Bangladeshi worker?\u2019 And sometimes you have to pay some money to be let go.\u201d\nRecent arrivals often turn to the Rohingya Society in Malaysia, which supplies them with papers listing their names, birth dates and backgrounds. The society also issues semblances of official documents like marriage certificates and divorce papers that migrants cannot get from the Malaysian government.\nThe Rohingya have also tried to overcome their hardships by establishing rudimentary schools; by helping one another find work; and by joining organizations that provide services, advice and a sense of solidarity.\n\u201cThe Rohingya are actively employing strategies of community self-protection,\u201d said Matthew Smith, an executive director of Fortify Rights, an organization based in Bangkok that monitors refugee conditions in the region. \u201cThe government of Malaysia is not providing adequate protection, and so they have to draw more on their own resources.\u201d\nThose resources are limited by the migrants\u2019 poverty and by the desperate needs of the recent arrivals.\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said it was supporting 31 \u201clearning centers\u201d across Malaysia for Rohingya children, and other schools operate without United Nations support. But Abdul Ghani, the president of the Myanmar Ethnic Rohingyas Human Rights Organization Malaysia, said that only a small fraction of Rohingya children in Malaysia received a steady education.\nAccess to medical care can be another problem. \u201cI try to help these people, because I have also suffered,\u201d said Ismail Ahmad, a Rohingya practitioner of traditional medicine who fled Myanmar in 2007 and said he was helping about 60 migrants, many of them recent arrivals. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have much money for medicine or food, so often there is not much we can do.\u201d\nMr. Ahmad showed a poultice of herbs wrapped in cloth and tied around a warm brick, which he used to treat paralysis and cramps that migrants suffer after long sea voyages.\n\u201cSometimes they have lived for two or three months in the hold, and so they cannot walk by themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is the best treatment we can offer.\u201d\nMyanmar and its neighbors see the people of the Rohingya ethnic group and the seaborne trafficking of migrants in the region very differently, complicating the refugees\u2019 plight.\nMany Rohingya believe that their circumstances here are part of an elaborate plot by the Myanmar government to keep them weak and stigmatized, even in exile. Myanmar, an overwhelmingly Buddhist country, considers the Rohingya illegitimate Muslim intruders from what is now Bangladesh, and in 1982 it stripped many Rohingya of citizenship.\nAbout 200 men gathered in a spare concrete hall in Ampang on Wednesday for the anniversary of the killing of 10 Rohingya by villagers in Rakhine State in western Myanmar, after three Rohingya were accused of raping and murdering a Buddhist woman. The violence signaled the start of a wave of persecution that has prompted hundreds of thousands to flee the country.\nThe gathering at the hall was a rare display of collective political assertion by the Rohingya in Malaysia, many of whom wore red T-shirts proclaiming their ethnicity.\nNoting that the hall was only half full, Faridullah bin Dudumiya, a Muslim cleric who has lived as a refugee here for 25 years, said he was both proud and a little discouraged. \u201cIt\u2019s not often we\u2019re acting as a community,\u201d Mr. Faridullah, 47, said. \u201cBut it seems our voice is still not strong enough, even on this day.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are illegal people.\u201d",

A searchable guide to these and many other art shows is at nytimes.com/events. \nMuseums\nAmerican Folk Art Museum: \u2018A Shared Legacy: Folk Art in America\u2019  (through March 8) Drawn from a private collection, this beguiling show presents more than 60 choice objects including paintings, drawings, sculptures, furniture, painted chests and knickknacks made between 1800 and 1920. Altogether they embody a paradox for modern viewers: They evoke a world and a way of life that modernity has eclipsed, and yet they feel as vivid as anything you might desire in the art of today. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, 212-595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)\n\u2605 Brooklyn Museum: \u2018Killer Heels: The Art of the High-Heeled Shoe\u2019 (through March 1) Whether you view extra-high heels with lust or horror, as objects of empowerment or objectification, this in-depth survey of elevating footwear from past and present, East and West, is a model of the curatorial craft. It examines its subject from several fruitful angles, including unflattering ones, interspersed with excellent labels, relevant objects of art and especially design, clips from famous films and videos both didactic and artistic. Its main flaw: dim lighting dictated by fragile materials means that some shoes are most visible in the catalog. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)\n\u2605 Brooklyn Museum: \u2018Judith Scott \u2014 Bound and Unbound\u2019  (through March 29) Judith Scott\u2019s mesmerizing sculptures sit like large, unopened bundles, contents mysterious, in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum. In a few, solid forms can be made out under wrappings of yarn, string and fabric strips; others suggest gift-wrapped boulders. You can call them abstract and stop there, or go further and connect them to art history, specifically the history of fiber art, or go further and consider them in the light of Ms. Scott\u2019s history: She was born in 1943 with Down syndrome, started making art only in her early 40s and kept making it until her death at 61. However approached, the work is complex and brilliant. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)\n\u2605 Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum (continuing) The stately doors of the 1902 Andrew Carnegie mansion, home to the Cooper Hewitt, are open again after an overhaul and expansion of the premises. Historic house and modern museum have always made an awkward fit, a standoff between preservation and innovation, and the problem remains, but the renovation has brought a wide-open new gallery space, a cafe and a raft of be-your-own-designer digital enhancements. Best of all, more of the museum\u2019s vast permanent collection is now on view, including an Op Art weaving, miniature spiral staircases, ballistic face masks and a dainty enameled 18th-century version of a Swiss knife. Like design itself, this institution is built on tumult and friction, and you feel it. 2 East 91st Street, at Fifth Avenue, 212-849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Cotter)\n\u2605 Guggenheim Museum: \u2018On Kawara \u2014 Silence\u2019  (through May 3) The first retrospective of this Conceptual Art giant turns the museum\u2019s spiral into a vortex suffused with the consciousness of time, life\u2019s supreme ruler, in all its quotidian daily unfoldings, historical events and almost incomprehensible grandeur. The presentation of date paintings, \u201cI Got Up\u201d postcards and \u201cI AM Still Alive\u201d telegrams echoes Mr. Kawara\u2019s exquisite sense of discipline and craft. This is an extraordinary tribute. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, 212-423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)\nInstitute for the Study of the Ancient World: \u2018From Ancient to Modern: Archaeology and Aesthetics\u2019 (through June 7) Small but bursting with ideas, this show tells a fascinating tale about the 20th-century excavation and interpretation of some ancient Sumerian artifacts. It focuses on about 50 objects that were unearthed in the 1920s and \u201930s in Mesopotamia, including sumptuous jewelry and wide-eyed, bearded men carved from stone. Along with these are profuse archaeological documentation; paintings and sculptures by 20th-century artists like Willem de Kooning and Henry Moore who were inspired by Sumerian art; and politically fraught works by two contemporary artists, Jananne al-Ani and Michael Rakowitz. Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, 15 East 84th Street, Manhattan, 212-992-7800, isaw.nyu.edu. (Johnson)\n\u2605 Jewish Museum: \u2018Helena Rubinstein: Beauty Is Power\u2019 (through March 22) The first museum show devoted to the life and art collection of the cosmetics magnate Helena Rubinstein is a master class in modernism-as-marketing \u2014 one that comes with a strong female perspective on 20th-century visual culture. It shows us how Rubinstein adapted Cubism, Surrealism and other avant-garde art and design movements for her personal brand, highlighting new and different standards of beauty and exhorting women to control their own images through makeup and grooming. Mixing biography, business, art, fashion and d\u00e9cor, it recreates rooms from Rubinstein\u2019s salons and reassembles parts of her diverse collection, which included African, pre-Columbian and Oceanic artworks. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)\n\u2605 Metropolitan Museum of Art: \u2018Madame C\u00e9zanne\u2019  (through March 15) C\u00e9zanne\u2019s paintings of his wife, Hortense Fiquet, have long stonewalled would-be psychologists, offering few indications of intimacy or interior life. (The poet Rainer Maria Rilke, enthusing over \u201cMadame C\u00e9zanne in a Red Armchair,\u201d focused on the work\u2019s color scheme and called the chair \u201ca personality in its own right.\u201d) But assembled at the Met, and supported by more tender and informal graphite sketches, these portraits are more forthcoming. They suggest that numbing familiarity was actually, for C\u00e9zanne, a form of intimacy; that he could connect with portrait subjects only when they were as reliable a presence in his life as Mont Sainte-Victoire. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)\nMetropolitan Museum of Art: \u2018Making Pottery Art: The Robert A. Ellison Jr. Collection of French Ceramics (ca. 1880-1910)\u2019  (through March 15) Nearly all the 40 works in this show \u2014 from a collection recently donated to the museum \u2014 are in a traditional form of vases, bowls and platters. They represent a marvelous variety of styles and influences, including Art Nouveau, Arts and Crafts, classic Chinese traditions and European folk art. What they share is a love for processes and materials and a candid way with the human touch. Most intriguing of all is a curiously clunky small vase by Paul Gauguin, who might have been the George Ohr of European ceramics if he\u2019d stuck with it. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)\n\u2605 Metropolitan Museum of Art: \u2018Reimagining Modernism: 1900-1950\u2019 (continuing) One of the greatest encyclopedic museums in the world fulfills its mission a little more with an ambitious reinstallation of works of early European modernism with their American counterparts for the first time in nearly 30 years. Objects of design and paintings by a few self-taught artists further the integration. It is quite a sight, with interesting rotations and fine-tunings to come. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)\n\u2605 Metropolitan Museum of Art: \u2018Thomas Hart Benton\u2019s \u201cAmerica Today\u201d Mural Rediscovered\u2019 (through April 19) The prickly American Regionalist Thomas Hart Benton had his share of detractors. But even they would probably acknowledge that his early mural \u201cAmerica Today\u201d is the best of its kind, a raucous, cartwheeling, wide-angle look at 1920s America that set the standard for the Works Progress Administration\u2019s mural program and has remained a New York City treasure. Now installed at the Met in a reconstruction of its original setting (a boardroom at the New School for Social Research), it captivates with period details (from the cut of a flapper gown to the mechanics of a blast furnace) and timely signs of socioeconomic and environmental distress (exhausted coal miners and hands reaching for coffee and bread). 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)\n\u2605 Metropolitan Museum of Art: \u2018Warriors and Mothers: Epic Mbembe Art\u2019 (through Sept. 7) If a dozen masterpiece Renaissance sculptures, done in an unknown and wildly unorthodox style, suddenly turned up in the Italian countryside, the find would make the news. You\u2019ll encounter the equivalent of such a discovery in this show of spectacular weatherworn, wood-carved figures, some dating to before the 17th century, that were made by the Mbeme in southeastern Nigeria and taken to Paris by an African dealer in the early 1970s. They caused a sensation among collectors and scholars at the time, and you can see why. But the effort to find more of them proved fruitless. The examples at the Met, which include the original dozen, represent all the fully intact stand-alone Mbembe figures known to exist. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)\nMoMA PS1: \u2018Bob and Roberta Smith: Art Amnesty\u2019 (through March 23) Bob and Roberta Smith is the cognomen of a British artist who specializes in humorously mocking art institutions and the conventional attitudes they tend to promulgate. The ostensible idea of this show is to give people an opportunity to officially retire from making art and to ceremonially discard works of art they own but no longer want. Unloaded works are displayed along with jazzy signs painted by Mr. Smith on all kinds of surfaces. One proclaims, \u201cJoseph Beuys conclusive proof not everyone is an artist.\u201d 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, 718-784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)\nMoMA PS1: \u2018Samara Golden: The Flat Side of the Knife\u2019 (through Sept. 7) Standing at a railing where you look into the museum\u2019s two-story-tall Duplex Gallery, you behold a confoundingly complicated interior architecture with furniture, stairways, musical instruments, wheelchairs and many other domestic items rendered in silvery, foil-clad foam board. The gallery\u2019s floor is covered by a grid of large mirrors so that everything is doubled. What you think is up may really be down and what you take to be real might be a virtual reflection of the real. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, 718-784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)\n\u2605 Museum of Modern Art: \u2018The Forever Now: Contemporary Painting in an Atemporal World\u2019 (through April 5) Despite being predictable and market-oriented in its choice of 17 artists, this museum\u2019s first painting survey in decades is well worth seeing. About half the artists are exceptional and the rest are represented by their best work. Based on the premise that all historical painting styles are equally available today, the exhibition has been smartly installed to juxtapose different approaches: figurative and abstract, digital and handmade, spare and opulent. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)\n\u2605 Museum of Modern Art: \u2018Jean Dubuffet: Soul of the Underground\u2019 (through April 5) \u201cLook at what lies at your feet!\u201d Jean Dubuffet wrote in a 1957 essay. \u201cA crack in the ground, sparkling gravel, a tuft of grass, some crushed debris, offer equally worthy subjects for your applause and admiration.\u201d In MoMA\u2019s stimulating show, drawn entirely from its collection, we can see how Dubuffet\u2019s earthbound gaze nourished his reinvention of the painted surface. On view are several canvases smeared with a mixture of oil, putty, sand and gravel, some of them with incised drawings that seem to equate painting with plowing. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)\n\u2605 Museum of Modern Art: \u2018Modern Photographs from the Thomas Walther Collection, 1909-1949\u2019 (through April 19) Overflowing with prints by Berenice Abbott, Andre Kertesz, Edward Weston and other luminaries from the first half of the 20th century, this exhibition would seem to be a straightforward look at photography\u2019s past. But the show, packaged with a book, a symposium and an engrossing interactive website, is really a bold attempt to visualize the future of photography inside the museum as it reckons with the unwieldy, image-saturated culture outside the galleries. With works by Aleksandr Rodchenko, Ms. Abbott, Alvin Langdon Coburn and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy that explore cities from unusual angles or abstract their infrastructure, the show\u2019s largest section, \u201cDynamics of the City,\u201d best encapsulates the Walther Collection\u2019s distinctly urban, peripatetic take on Modernism. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)\nMuseum of Modern Art: \u2018The Paris of Toulouse-Lautrec: Prints and Posters\u2019 (through March 22) In his printed works, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec chronicled and publicized the music halls, theaters, circuses, operas and cafes of Paris with terrific verve, sly wit and surprising subtlety. This enthralling show presents approximately 100 examples drawn from the museum\u2019s permanent collection. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)\n\u2605 Neue Galerie: \u2018Egon Schiele: Portraits\u2019 (through April 20) Of the approximately 125 items in this terrific show, there are only 11 oil paintings, which is a good thing. Except for a large picture of his wife, Edith, in a colorful striped dress, Schiele\u2019s works on canvas are dark and turgid. But his drawings are nimble and nuanced. Working on paper with pencil, charcoal, ink, gouache, watercolor and crayons, he portrayed himself and others with infectious avidity. There\u2019s hardly a single sheet here that doesn\u2019t warrant close looking for its virtuoso draftsmanship and psychological acuity. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, 212-628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Johnson)\n\u2605 New-York Historical Society: \u2018Freedom Journey 1965: Photographs of the Selma to Montgomery March by Stephen Somerstein\u2019 (through April 19) Almost 50 years ago, the picture editor of a campus newspaper at City College of New York assigned himself a breaking story: covering what promised to be a massive march in Alabama, led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., to demand free-and-clear voting rights for African-Americans. On short notice the editor, Stephen Somerstein, grabbed his cameras, climbed on a bus and headed south. The 55 pictures of black leaders and everyday people in this show, installed in a hallway and small gallery, are some that he shot that day. The image of Dr. King\u2019s head seen in monumental silhouette that has become a virtual logo of the film \u201cSelma\u201d is based on a Somerstein original. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Cotter)\n\u2605 Rubin Museum of Art: \u2018The All-Knowing Buddha: A Secret Guide\u2019 (through April 13) This show presents 54 paintings that illustrate step-by-step instructions for followers of Tibetan Buddhism. Delicately painted on 10-by-10-inch paper sheets, most of the pages depict a monk having fabulous visions in a verdant landscape. Thought to have been commissioned by a Mongolian patron and executed by unidentified artists in a Chinese workshop sometime in the 18th century, it is a fascinating and remarkably thorough manual for seekers of higher consciousness. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, 212-620-5000, rubinmuseum.org. (Johnson)\nSculpture Center: \u2018Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook\u2019  (through March 30) A pre-eminent artist in Southeast Asia, this Thai video maker addresses topics like death, the insane, East-West cultural differences, the disenfranchisement of women and the rights of animals, often in provocatively discomfiting ways. In a set of three videos, she gives professorial lectures about death to sets of real human corpses. Many of her most recent works have to do with dogs. In them, she protests the abuse of dogs and hints at a holistic vision of people in tune with nature and the cosmos. 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, 718-361-1750, sculpture-center.org. (Johnson)\nGalleries: Chelsea\n\u2018The New York School, 1969: Henry Geldzahler at the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019 (through March 14) This show revisits a large groundbreaking exhibition in 1969 organized by the Met\u2019s first curator of 20th-century art. Its radiant works evoke the big-name movers and shakers of Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art and Minimalism, while also representing art history as unquestioningly orderly, monolithic and male. Paul Kasmin, 293 10th Avenue, 212-563-4474, paulkasmingallery.com. (Smith)\n\u2018Vis-\u00e0-vis\u2019  (through Feb. 28) Organized by the artist Michael Mahalchick, this exhibition staunchly ignores the boundary between outsider artists and those of the insider persuasion \u2014 among them Willem de Kooning. A very good time, full of useful parallels and connections, is had by all 16 artists. Andrew Edlin Gallery, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, 212-206-9723, edlingallery.com. (Smith)\nGalleries: Other\nJames Benning and Peter Hutton (through March 8) Three slow, beautiful installations of moving images by James Benning and Peter Hutton include Mr. Benning\u2019s \u201cTulare Road\u201d (2010), which was shot digitally but includes repeating segments. Mr. Hutton\u2019s three-channel installations were shot on 16-millimeter film and transferred to video. Deep-hued and expertly composed, the films are also subtle commentaries on labor and globalization. There is footage of a ship being constructed in Korea, images taken from a ship at sea and film of workers demolishing freighters in Bangladesh \u2014 and at Orchard Street, three different forms of industry: salt miners in arid Ethiopia, farmers in the verdant Hudson Valley and repairmen in a familiarly bleak Detroit. All three exhibit a mastery of the moving picture that is arresting, instructive and impressive.

(Martha Schwendener)\n\u2018Call and Response\u2019 (through Feb. 28) The unruly state of contemporary, often youthful painting is summarized by this boisterous effort: a crowded display of 59 painters, all of whom chose which of their works would be shown. The totality resembles a juried exhibition that still needs some jurying, but subtracting what you dislike in your mind\u2019s eye still leaves quite a bit worth looking at.

(Smith)\nJim Woodring: \u2018You Drive!\u2019  (through next Friday) Mr. Woodring is a giant in the world of comics and graphic novels. This show\u2019s assortment of recent drawings and paintings displays his extraordinary gifts as a draughtsman, storyteller and creator of hilarious characters, including Frank, a hapless, accident-prone innocent. It includes 15 original pages from \u201cFran,\u201d about a female version of Frank with whom he has a tempestuous love affair that ends badly early in the story. This propels him into a picaresque quest to retrieve his lost love in a psychedelic world populated by monsters, demons and bizarre objects and architecture.

(Johnson)\nPublic Art\n\u2018Archeo\u2019 (through March) Shortening the word archaeology, this exhibition focuses on technology and obsolescence. Marianne Vitale\u2019s sculptures made from steel components of railroad switches known as frogs are one highlight; Jessica Jackson Hutchins\u2019s neo-hippie assemblages with found ceramics and a hand-woven hammock another. Across the bar from the Standard Hotel, Josh Kline takes the most activist stance, with smoothies made from prescription drugs and consumer products, while a mural by the veteran artist Ed Ruscha \u2014 a new commission separate from \u201cArcheo\u201d \u2014 announces \u201cHoney, I Twisted Through More Damn Traffic Today,\u201d perhaps capturing the ethos of the tourist-clogged High Line.

(Schwendener)\nOut of Town\n\u2605 Dia:Beacon: \u2018Carl Andre: Sculpture as Place, 1958-2010\u2019 (through March 9) Minimalism was the late 20th century\u2019s great hope for a heroic American art on the Abstract Expressionism model. Carl Andre was one of Minimalism\u2019s founders. This career survey of his low-to-the-ground modular sculptures looks terrific in Dia\u2019s sonorous, sunlight-washed spaces. It also poses the question of how such monument-minded art can feel so modest, intimate \u2014 even delicate. The real treat here is the chance to see dozens of manuscript pages of Mr. Andre\u2019s 1960s poems, which he referred to as \u201ctypewriter drawings.\u201d Carefully shaped on the page in lines and blocks, they are evidence of a sculptor-to-be at work. 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., 845-440-0100, diaart.org. (Cotter)\n\u2605 National Museum of African Art: \u2018Conversations: African and African American Artists in Dialogue\u2019  (through early 2016) For its 50th anniversary, this museum has brilliantly thread together work from two sources: its own holdings in African material and the Camille O. and William H. Cosby Jr. collection of African-American art. The Cosby collection, weighted toward canonical figures like Romare Bearden and Charles White, will bring in the crowds, but it is the curators and museum itself, which is in a period of renaissance, that have made the show rise well above predictability. Smithsonian Institution, 950 Independence Avenue SW, Washington, 202-633-4600, africa.si.edu. (Cotter)\nPennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts: \u2018Peter Blume: Nature and Metamorphosis\u2019 (through April 5) Though not well-known today, Blume (1906-92) was a famous American artist during the 1930s and \u201940s. For many years his painting \u201cThe Eternal City\u201d (1934-37) was one of the most memorable artworks displayed in the permanent collection galleries of the Museum of Modern Art. A weird, technically dazzling mix of Magic and Social Realism that envisioned Rome under the Fascist reign of Mussolini, it\u2019s among the highlights of this exhibition of more than 150 works dating from 1924 to 1990. 128 North Broad Street, Philadelphia, 215-972-7600, pafa.org. (Johnson)\nLast Chance\nJanice Guy (closes on Monday) Ms. Guy\u2019s photographs from the late 1970s, on view at Cleopatra\u2019s, are similar to what other artists, particularly women, were doing at the time. The nude body in these hand-tinted vintage prints is not the sexually available one that incited feminists. Instead, Ms. Guy photographed herself in mirrors and windows, wearing a sensible wristwatch and treating the body as a medium for meditating on photography, vision and subjecthood. And yet most people in the art world know Ms. Guy as a co-owner of Murray Guy. In her works at this Cleopatra\u2019s show, you can sense the nascent sensibility of Murray Guy artists \u2014 a profound reminder that there are more ways to affect the trajectory of art than merely making it. 110 Meserole Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, cleopatras.us. (Schwendener)\n\u2018Looking Back: The 9th White Columns Annual\u2019 (closes on Saturday) This overview of the 2014 exhibitions in New York galleries and museums has been selected by the four women of Cleopatra\u2019s, a Brooklyn curatorial collective, and they have done their homework. Their sprawling, deftly installed effort ranks among the most ecumenical, visually rewarding surveys mustered at this venerable alternative space. It instills hope about art and the art world.

In each case, however, the pieces are by Ms. Sturtevant herself, who spent much of a long career adopting and adapting the art and styles of others to create a body of work entirely her own, one which raises questions about the value of art, about the hows and whys of producing it, and about the degrees to which quasi-replication can be an exercise in flattery, parody, objectivity, originality and love. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)\n\u2605 Mike Nelson: \u2018Gang of Seven\u2019 (closes on Saturday) This British artist has filled the gallery with a lively crowd of lyrical assemblages made of detritus collected from the beaches and coastal waters of British Columbia. They are cobbled from bottles, driftwood, chunks of plastic foam, lengths of frayed rope, bald tires, pieces of rusted iron and animal skulls. Several pieces consist of weathered, partly charred lengths of wood screwed together to resemble bonfire remains with pieces of orange plastic added to represent low-burning flames. 303 Gallery, 507 West 24th Street, 212-255-1121, 303gallery.com. (Johnson)\nNew-York Historical Society: Annie Leibovitz: \u2018Pilgrimage\u2019  (closes on Sunday) No living celebrities are portrayed in \u201cPilgrimage,\u201d but lots of celebrated figures from the past are indirectly represented, from Thomas Jefferson and Emily Dickinson to Eleanor Roosevelt and Robert Smithson. In the spring of 2009, Ms. Leibovitz set out on a two-year journey that took her to about two dozen historic sites in the United States and Britain. Most of these were house museums dedicated to famous individuals, where she photographed the rooms they inhabited and objects they owned and used. Though often poetically atmospheric, these pictures are disappointingly less lively than her portraits of famous entertainers. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Johnson)\n\u2018Uche Okeke: Works on Paper, 1958-1993\u2019  (closes on Saturday) Born in Nigeria in 1933, Uche Okeke was, in the 1950s, a founding member of the Zaria Art Society, a group of academically trained experimental artists who joined Western media \u2014 oil paint, pastel, pen and ink \u2014 and African content which, for Mr. Okeke, included a distinctive type of drawing associated with Igbo peoples in the south of the country. Unlike some of his colleagues who emigrated to Europe and the United States, he has spent almost all of his career in Africa, teaching until the late 1980s at the University of Nigeria at Nsukka. The result in this thumbnail survey of works on paper is art that, without looking specifically ethnic, is thoroughly and consciously African in its references. Skoto Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, fifth floor, 212-352-8058, skotogallery.com. (Cotter)\n\u2018Quiet Tremors\u2019 (closes on Saturday) The Kate Werble Gallery\u2019s somewhat Minimalist aesthetic is maintained by this svelte group show, which is nonetheless the first in its six-year history to feature paintings. Its six artists make a good case for an understated, and these days often overtouted, style of abstract painting based on unusual materials or processes, while also expanding the Werble worldview in promising ways. Kate Werble Gallery, 83 Van Dam Street, SoHo, 212-352-9700, katewerblegallery.com. (Smith)\n\u2605 \u2018Respond\u2019 (closes on Sunday) This large group show at a nonprofit alternative, Smack Mellon, is one of the few New York exhibitions to directly address the issues of racism, police violence and social justice that filled the news after the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and Eric Garner on Staten Island. Much of the work, solicited through an open call online, is installed salon-style, six pieces deep, in the gallery\u2019s two-story-high front space. It ranges across generations, from a 1985 painting of a salivating police dog in South Africa, by Jerry Kearns, to entries by young artists like Faith Briggs, Elliott Brown, and Maya Mackrandilal, who are showing in New York for the first time. Much of what\u2019s here is topically on message. But there are many subtleties, and the large amount of painting and drawing gives life to complaints about the underdog status of these forms. Smack Mellon has organized a strong program of panels, performances and poetry readings to supplement the show. 92 Plymouth Street, near Washington Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, 718-834-8761, smackmellon.org. (Cotter)\nAssaf Shaham: \u2018Division of the Vision\u2019 (closes on Saturday) Mr. Shaham\u2019s first solo show in the United States is full of ambitious gestures, mostly concerning the history of photography and its demise as a chemical medium. Scanograms, made by stacking one flatbed scanner on top of another and hitting the \u201cscan\u201d button, resulted in vibrant works that recall photograms and geometric paintings by Piet Mondrian. Other works include photographing a deconstructed book of August Sander\u2019s early-20th-century portraits cataloging German citizens, and a slide show of smiling portraits from the 1930s of people \u2014 actually photographed to document the effects of nutrition on his subjects\u2019 teeth.

The main gallery is flooded by an intense blue light. In the center is a mysterious, room-size box, which appears to hover above a band of bright yellow light. A grainy video projected on the ceiling shows dung beetles slowly moving about in a thicket of brown grass. It has to do with the fact that dung beetles navigate at night by the lights of stars in the sky. David Zwirner, 533 West 19th Street, 212-727-2070, davidzwirner.com. (Johnson)\nDavid Weiss: \u2018Works, 1968-1979\u2019 (closes on Sunday) This Swiss artist (1946-2012) is best known for the sly, jokey photographs, sculptures and videos he made with Peter Fischli under the name Fischli/Weiss. Before Fischli/Weiss started in 1979, however, Mr. Weiss published artists\u2019 books. Included in this exhibition are more than 60 comics, abstractions and psychedelic landscapes peppered with anthropomorphic insects, plants and animals. What\u2019s really on display here, though, is an ethos: call it post-\u201960s exhaustion or countercultural ennui. After this, Mr. Weiss and Mr. Fischli would make the work they\u2019re known for, couched in photographic irony and humor rather than hand-drawn hippie existentialism.

    "text": "\u2018The Longest August,\u2019 About India and Pakistan, by Dilip Hiro\n2015-04-24T13:27:05.000Z\nIn the summer of 2009, as the clouds of Taliban violence thickened over Pakistan, I bumped into a senior army general at a polo game. We were in Shandur, a spectacular grassy arena in the Hindu Kush mountains, watching local horsemen play a rambunctious version of the genteel sport.\nThe general was taking a break from the heat of battle. One hundred miles to the south, in the Swat Valley, Taliban fighters were on the rampage that year \u2014 flogging teenage girls in public, executing Swat\u2019s famed dancing girls and generally behaving with a ruthless gusto that shocked many Pakistanis. Now, after years of inaction, the military was fighting back. Pakistan, it seemed, was finally paying the price of its longstanding support of certain jihadi groups.\nThe general, however, saw it differently. With his swagger stick balanced on his knee as he watched the match, he confided that the Taliban were, in fact, being secretly backed by India. Pakistani soldiers had discovered Indian weapons and currency in the rebel lairs of Swat \u2014 proof positive that behind what appears to be a religiously motivated enemy lay the hidden hand of Pakistan\u2019s greatest rival.\nSuch accusations were not uncommon then among Pakistani security officials, even if they were rarely substantiated. But the fact that they could be made with such conviction spoke volumes about the emotional resonance of Pakistan\u2019s decades-old rivalry with India, and how even today it looms, like Banquo\u2019s ghost, over other conflicts across South Asia.\nDilip Hiro traces the bitter contours of that rivalry in \u201cThe Longest August,\u201d a history that spans a century of antagonism, skulduggery and war, from the tensions between the Hindu and Muslim leaders of the British Raj, in the early 20th century, up to the horrors of the 2008 attacks on Mumbai and the most recent, failed efforts to make peace between these estranged siblings. It is a tale of broken bloodlines, fatal miscalculations and mutual paranoia that has placed a bitter parting at the center of the destiny of a subcontinent. And it is timely: As American troops beat a hasty retreat from Afghanistan after 14 years of troubled intervention, the region\u2019s most intractable dispute is now surging back to the surface.\nPeace between Pakistan and India has long been seen as the region\u2019s diplomatic holy grail, the key to unlocking hostilities from Kabul to Kashmir. Yet, as \u201cThe Longest August\u201d comprehensively demonstrates, history offers few reasons to hope it might happen any time soon. Hiro, a veteran freelance journalist based in London, dutifully covers much ground. He skillfully teases out the contradictions of leaders on both sides, and is generally fair-minded in apportioning blame for their many failings.\nMuch of the story, though, is dominated by the boom of artillery as Pakistan and India flirt with war, and occasionally indulge in it. Hiro takes an unswerving view of the frequently negative role played by foreign powers like China and the United States, which sought to leverage the rivalry between Pakistan and India to their own ends. He spotlights the Nixon administration\u2019s shameful role during the 1971 war in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), when American officials turned a blind eye to Pakistani war crimes \u2014 territory that was comprehensively covered in Gary J. Bass\u2019s \u201cThe Blood Telegram.\u201d\nHiro also offers fascinating accounts of the espionage wars between the two countries, some of them half-forgotten today. He reminds us that, during the 1980s, Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan secretly armed Sikh separatists in India, while Indian leaders plotted with Israel to bomb Pakistan\u2019s clandestine nuclear facilities \u2014 an attack that never came to pass.\nInevitably, perhaps, the story is \u00adweighted toward turbulent Pakistan, which has produced more quotable villains. \u201cDrinking, gambling, dancing and music were the way the officers spent their free time,\u201d says the Islamist General Zia. \u201cI said prayers, instead.\u201d Yet the political drama is interrupted by anecdotes about the movie industry, and how Bollywood musicals have succeeded where politicians have failed in bringing Indians and Pakistanis together.\nYet \u201cThe Longest August\u201d \u2014 a reference to the month in which India was partitioned in 1947 \u2014 also squanders the rich material at its disposal. The narrative is unwieldy, often plodding, in places, with long lists of events that lack even a sprig of analysis to draw them together. Efforts to personalize major figures can come across as clumsy, even unkind. He describes Indira Gandhi\u2019s face as \u201ca cross between the refined, sinewy features of her father and the bloated visage of her mother.\u201d Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the Pakistani leader, is a \u201cprematurely balding man with a sharp nose in a buttery face.\u201d\nElsewhere, there is too little detail. For a book written by a journalist, there is a disappointing dearth of new information or, indeed, first-person reportage that could help bring the story to life. An interview with a farmer in Kashmir in the opening chapter, for instance, is drawn directly from another journalist\u2019s account.\nAnd while Hiro is generally careful in his observations, he baldly states as fact assertions that do not enjoy widespread acceptance \u2014 that Pakistan first exploded a nuclear device in China in 1984, 14 years before the country\u2019s official inaugural test; or that Benazir Bhutto met her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, through their mutual love of Bollywood movies.\nGreater trade could help end the \u201clongest August\u201d of the title, he concludes, yet there is little insight into how this might be achieved. Such seeds are blowing in the wind these days. Robust exchanges of artillery fire between Indian and Pakistani border troops early this year, coupled with the advent of a staunch Hindu nationalist, Narendra Modi, in the prime minister\u2019s seat in New Delhi, have caused tensions to peak. These tensions will probably abate, of course, as the two nuclear-armed neighbors seek to de-escalate while saving face \u2014 a familiar dance, leading nowhere, yet one that is never more than one misstep away from a terrible mistake, with potentially stark consequences.",

    "text": "Uncertainty and Helplessness Become a Way of Life in Nepal\n2015-05-24T18:30:33.000Z\nKATHMANDU, Nepal \u2014 I am not the old me.\nIt is not something I would have noticed a month ago. But now I notice it almost all the time. I\u2019ve begun to see it in my friends too, in the topic of our conversations, in the lives that we lead and in what makes us happy. I watch it in the eyes and in the body language of the people I interview. I feel it even in the wild weather, the gale force winds and thunderstorms that have torn across my adopted city this week. I am constantly on edge.\nI live in Kathmandu, Nepal\u2019s capital. My life did not change immediately on April 25 when a magnitude 7.8 earthquake tore through central and eastern Nepal, killing more than 8,500 people, injuring thousands and leaving an estimated 2.5 million people homeless. Yes, I remember the fast thuds of my heart and my shaking hands after the interminable 40 seconds of rolling earth, crumbling walls and nearby screams. Then came the more than 240 aftershocks, including a terrifying magnitude 7.3 temblor this month that I weathered on the fourth floor of a swaying building.\n\u201cThis is not my Kathmandu anymore,\u201d my friend Deepesh Das Shrestha told me recently of the city where he grew up. \u201cI don\u2019t recognize it. People will only talk about one thing: It\u2019s the earthquake.\u201d\nIt\u2019s really too easy to call it fear. One word cannot possibly encapsulate this inability to predict or control a force that doesn\u2019t have an end date. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice,\u201d said my 10-year-old son, Lucas, just after a 6.8 aftershock on April 26, \u201cif the earthquake would send us an email telling us when it would arrive?\u201d\nFear for so many of us here is a living, breathing, controlling creature, a domino effect that continues to grow and beat down our rational, intelligent thinking selves. In the past weeks in Kathmandu, panic has spread as astrologers and holy men made public (and incorrect) declarations about the imminent time and date of the next major earthquake. In response, one famous astrologer took to the airwaves to say astrology could not predict natural disasters.\nEarthquake fear is also a business venture. The police have arrested several would-be thieves who went through neighborhoods predicting an earthquake with the aim of breaking into empty houses as residents fled. It has gotten to the point where the government canceled a public lecture by one of the most respected Himalayan seismologists because it did not want to risk inspiring panic.\nI\u2019ve noticed the symptoms in my friends and in myself. It is in the camps for the displaced; in the far-flung villages facing hunger and landslides; in the homes for orphans; and even in the semi-destroyed prisons where inmates live under tents like so many other Nepalis. It\u2019s the exhausting hypervigilance. I don\u2019t lock or even close the bathroom door anymore, even if it is in a public washroom, just in case it jams in a quake. I slept outdoors for a week, then on the living room floor close to a door that led to my yard for another week, and I will return there when my husband heads out of town. Many of my neighbors still sleep outdoors.\nI always wear closed shoes, regardless of the heat, because I know I cannot run through rubble in sandals. I carry a go-bag everywhere, with essentials like bottled water, rain gear, snack food, a hat and several phone chargers. It even sits by my bed every night, alongside a crowbar.\nOne of Kathmandu\u2019s most common complaints is the \u201cearthquake hangover,\u201d which means we feel the ground moving even when it\u2019s not. Apparently it is an inner ear reaction to all the aftershocks, some 240 since April 25. I deal with it by placing a bowl of water near my laptop so that I have a frame of reference. Every crack, car backfire, slamming door makes me stand up and rush to the door. Even when I turn over in bed, I do a double take, thinking the earth is moving.\nAny post-traumatic stress disorder counselor can list the other reactions. Avoidance, trying to bury the trauma, is one of them. That is not my problem. Intrusive thoughts, yes. I have lost count of the hours spent awake in the middle of the night trying not worry about how I would react if another major earthquake hit.\nMy stress hormones really hit a new high last week when I dropped my son off at school and noticed that many of the other parents were nervously talking about reports that a British seismologist had predicted another large earthquake and that this had supposedly prompted a sizable group of European nationals to leave the country. (International schools in Kathmandu are open, but all Nepalese schools in the affected districts remain closed by order of the government. More than 10,000 schools were destroyed.) I immediately dashed off an email to my husband, who was in Bangladesh, typing it entirely in the subject line: \u201cAm I missing something? There is an imminent big quake?\u201d\nOf course, I searched for the seismologist on Google, and to make myself feel better have since refused to mention his name. I just call him Nostradamus. What became my saving grace, my first successful effort at learning to control what I alone can control, was meeting Roger Bilham, another British seismologist, a professor at the University of Colorado and one of the world\u2019s experts on Himalayan tectonic, who with a mix of humor and unbridled enthusiasm explained to me the unmistakable beauty in the word \u201ccreep.\u201d\nEarthquakes cannot be predicted. Seismologists work with facts and history and provide hypotheses that they change when they are proved wrong. This is what we need to know. The April 25 earthquake did not break the earth\u2019s surface. The Kathmandu Valley moved only 1.5 meters. It could have moved as much as six more meters, but it got stuck and not enough energy dissipated. This situation is very similar to the Kathmandu earthquake of 1833 that had a violent sequel in 1835. Yes, there could be another earthquake, but it could happen tomorrow, in a year, in a decade or beyond. If you evacuated for the next big one, you might have to wait a long while to return. Another earthquake could happen out in western Nepal. In a far less violent scenario, the Indian plate could gently creep or slide under the Eurasian plate, or an earthquake could take place deep inside the Indian plate. Or the stuck plate could push and raise the Mahabharat mountains just south of Kathmandu.\nWith my introduction to creep (and all the other options), my fear level dropped from a nine to a five out of 10. I am where I am. I live where I live. I can only control certain parts of my life. Yes, I have my nervous hypervigilant moments, and it will take a while before I wear sandals again. I live in a country above a stuck tectonic plate. I cannot control that.\n\u201cWe are reading a book but have reached only Page 32 out of 65,\u201d explained Professor Bilham, who with colleagues is laying GPS monitoring stations where the earthquake got stuck. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what will happen, but it is such an exciting seismological time.\u201d",

    "text": "A Midtown Apartment Near Grand Central\n2015-08-13T08:57:03.000Z\nLiving near Grand Central Terminal was Sabah Rabbi\u2019s priority.\n\u201cI feel I have more control being within walking distance,\u201d said Ms. Rabbi, who arises at\u00a06 a.m.\u00a0and has a commute of about an hour via Metro-North to her finance job in Fairfield County, Conn. \u201cIf I am running one or two minutes late, I can still run and make my train. If I miss my train, I am half an hour late.\u201d\u00a0\nMs. Rabbi, 32, who is from Dhaka, Bangladesh, came to the United States to attend Colgate University in Hamilton, N.Y. After her graduation in 2005, she lived for a time with relatives in Jamaica, Queens.\u00a0\nWhen she landed a job in Westchester County, N.Y., that would require train travel, she moved to a share in Midtown East with roommates. \u201cWe were just out of school and very broke,\u201d she said. \u201cThe apartment was very crusty, but that\u2019s what everybody does.\u201d She moved several times within the East 30s and 40s, always seeking to upgrade, finally renting a studio by herself in the high East 30s for $2,800 a month.\u00a0\nShe moved a lot \u2014 more than any of her friends \u2014 and became weary of moving. She wanted stability, a nice home and an investment. It made sense to buy a place.\nHer aim was a one-bedroom with a large kitchen in a postwar building within about 10 blocks of Grand Central.\nMs. Rabbi (pronounced Robby) set a price range of around $600,000 to $800,000. \u201cBecause I am a single person with a single-person income, I wasn\u2019t sure what I was able to afford,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nLast fall, she contacted Raoul Marc Boisset, a friend of a friend and a salesman at Town Residential, who has since moved on to Stribling & Associates.\nBoth knew what kind of apartment she could expect to find \u2014 a boxy one-bedroom in an elevator building with an attended lobby. \u201cThere is a certain conformity to that part of Manhattan,\u201d Mr. Boisset said.\u00a0\nEarly on, Ms. Rabbi fell for a one-bedroom in a 1962 brick co-op building on East 55th Street, listed for $799,000. The renovated apartment was bigger than many similar ones \u2014 its 825 square feet included a foyer, a walk-in closet and an office or den area. Monthly maintenance was a bit more than $1,500.\nThe apartment was at the top of her price range and farther north than she liked. Envisioning herself running most of the way to the train station, she passed it by. The place sold for the asking price.\nIn a 1959 co-op building on East 49th Street, a one-bedroom with a little less than 800 square feet was less expensive, around $625,000. The maintenance was more than $1,700 a month.\nMs. Rabbi couldn\u2019t quite meet the co-op board\u2019s financial requirements. Because she had switched to the job in Fairfield County in midyear, her paperwork indicated she made less than she really did.\u00a0\n\u201cI decided if it was going to be that difficult to buy that place, it would be difficult to sell,\u201d she said. The building also had a comparatively rigid rental policy \u2014 and Ms. Rabbi wanted the ability to rent out her home in the future. That one, too, sold for the asking price.\u00a0\nThe dozens of apartments she saw \u201chad a lot of things in common,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were pretty much the same apartment,\u201d with differences in condition, light, view and building amenities.\nA 1974 Murray Hill co-op on East 38th Street had an attractive lobby and a swimming pool. The asking price for a one-bedroom with 700 square feet was $599,000, with monthly maintenance of around $1,250. Ms. Rabbi offered the asking price, but didn\u2019t especially mind that another offer, for the same amount, was accepted. The apartment\u2019s kitchen had been too small.\u00a0\nBesides, she had long cast her eye on a 1967 building on East 40th Street. She walked past often, and shopped at the drugstore across the street. A few years ago, she had even stopped to ask the doorman about apartments for rent. \u201cThe exterior is really grand and it looked like a really nice building,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nShe went to see a 750-square-foot one-bedroom there, on a high floor, listed for $799,000, with maintenance a little more than $1,400 a month. The building had other available one-bedrooms, but they were pricier because they were larger, had balconies or were in better condition. \nThe walls of the candidate apartment were an off-putting color, \u201ca dingy, gloomy something between cream and yellow,\u201d Ms. Rabbi said.\nLike many a prospective buyer, she wouldn\u2019t have made some of the decorating decisions the current owner had. But, she said, \u201cI knew I could make this place look better than he did.\u201d\u00a0\nMs. Rabbi had found little else that was sufficiently nice, and came to the conclusion that she\u2019d have to pay her top price in order \u201cto find something I wanted to live in,\u201d she said. \u201cI realized there\u2019s no point in being so conservative. I was more willing to have less cash reserve and get a nicer place that I would like.\u201d\nThis building had a pool along with a gym, which \u201cmade the deal that much sweeter,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nIn the spring, Ms. Rabbi bought the apartment at the asking price and hired a contractor, who worked often in the building, for some bathroom improvements and the necessary painting. The kitchen, though of a good size, is \u201cvery standard,\u201d she said, so she might renovate at some point.\u00a0\nDespite her high-floor location, her apartment is surprisingly noisy, with sirens screaming down Second Avenue.\u00a0\nBut Ms. Rabbi is glad she is able, finally, to stop moving. Her new home is one block farther east from Grand Central than her old one, but \u201cI am a very fast walker,\u201d she said. \u201cSo one block hasn\u2019t made a difference.\u201d",

    "text": "When It Comes to Wage Abuses, It\u2019s Not Just the Nail Salons\n2015-05-19T11:02:19.000Z\nThe cash registers of many gas stations never sleep. \u201cI was there seven days a week, 12 hours a day, 84 hours minimum. Minimum,\u201d said Chitra KC, 35, who worked in a station on Sunrise Highway in Holbrook, N.Y. He is one of about 27 immigrant workers from Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan or India with wage claims against stations on Long Island owned by Steve Keshtgar, who filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 on Dec. 24.\nChitra KC said he was owed 10 weeks\u2019 salary \u2014 about $8,600 \u2014 some of which he would like to use to help family members in Nepal who are recovering from the recent earthquakes. Other employees say they were pressed into renting beds in homes in Coram and Central Islip in Suffolk County that were owned by a manager for several gas stations.\n\u201cHe had 25 or 30 people sleeping in the garage, in the kitchen, in the living room,\u201d Chitra KC said. \u201cWhen the night-shift workers left for their jobs, the day-shift people took the beds.\u201d\nThis rental scheme and the unpaid wages were the work of a \u201crogue\u201d general manager, said Michael Macco, the bankruptcy lawyer for the gas station owner, who maintained that the manager was responsible for distributing paychecks.\nImmigrants are the pilings of the New York economy, the providers of low-cost labor and seamless comforts \u2014 like 24-hour takeout food, cheap nail salons, all-night gas stations, nonunion construction workers. Some entered the United States legally; others did not. The ability of unscrupulous employers to steal wages can take your breath away.\nGov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced on Monday that he would seek new rules and issue orders requiring improved health precautions and wage protections for employees in nail parlors and other branches of what is known as the \u201cappearance enhancement\u201d industry. He acted in response to a report in The New York Times on exploitation of workers in the nail parlors.\nThe governor has made a respectable start, deploying tools already at his power and seeking more from the State Legislature. But it adds up to not much more than a baby step: The trail of abuse runs deep in the construction and restaurant worlds.\nAs of the end of 2013, at least $125 million in unpaid judgments and orders for wage reimbursements had piled up over the previous 10 years, according to a study released in March, \u201cEmpty Judgments: The Wage Collection Crisis in New York.\u201d\nThe laws are clear on minimum wages and overtime, and it is also evident that people inclined to beat the law can do so. A coalition of public interest legal groups and labor advocates, which issued the study, argues that the enforcement system needs more teeth \u2014 an ability to make sure that assets are not hidden away when a claim appears to be valid. A bill incorporating those measures, including a lien for unpaid wages, has been presented to the Legislature by Assemblywoman Linda B. Rosenthal and State Senator Jos\u00e9 R. Peralta.\nAsked about the governor\u2019s position on the bill, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s counsel, Alphonso David, said he would review the legislation.\n\u201cWhere we are, generally, is we want to increase the tools available to state agencies to make sure that workers are paid appropriate wages,\u201d Mr. David said. In the last three years, he said, the state has increased the amount of money it has recovered for employees and reduced the percentage of deadbeat businesses.\nThere are still plenty of opportunities to get away with cheating.\nDavid Colodny, a supervising attorney with the Urban Justice Center, described a case that was still underway, and asked that the names not be revealed until the settlement discussions were completed.\nThe facts, though, are not contested.\nA cook in a Korean restaurant in Queens who worked six days a week for less than the minimum wage and with no overtime filed a lawsuit. The restaurant owners offered to pay him $45,000 plus legal fees of $8,400. The cook agreed. Before the judgment was officially entered in the court file, the owners \u2014 a husband and wife \u2014 transferred their principal asset, a house in Bayside with no mortgage, to their son for $0. Mr. Colodny filed a new claim for \u201cfraudulent conveyance,\u201d a process that could take years.\n\u201cThe restaurant owners are now trying to settle by offering less than what they originally agreed to,\u201d Mr. Colodny said. The case may yet settle, but it shows the frailty of the current system, he said, and the need for reforms.\n\u201cIf we had that,\u201d Mr. Colodny said, \u201cwe could just foreclose on the house.\u201d",

    "text": "In Brooklyn: Ice Cream With a Family on Top\n2015-08-14T19:50:28.000Z\nIn the concrete planter on the front porch of Kati Duncan-Cunningham and Ron Cunningham\u2019s 1907 house in the Kensington section of Brooklyn, a small American flag is planted among the impatiens.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very patriotic; the American dream is ingrained in our psyches,\u201d said Mr. Cunningham, 42, who owns Brooklyn Bell, a small-batch ice cream company in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, with his wife. \u201cWe often think about where we started\u201d \u2014 both are first-generation college graduates \u2014 \u201cto where we\u2019ve come.\u201d\nMs. Duncan-Cunningham, 44, added: \u201cRon\u2019s black and I am biracial, and we\u2019re grateful for the opportunities we have now compared to the generations before us.\u201d\nShortly after they married in 2009, the couple began talking about starting a business. \u201cWe both have an entrepreneurial streak,\u201d said Ms. Duncan-Cunningham, a lawyer who works as a financial services risk consultant.\nMr. Cunningham, a software engineer, was already moonlighting as a personal chef, and he proposed a company that would make artisanal ice cream using all-natural ingredients and milk from the Hudson Valley. Ms. Duncan-Cunningham was enthusiastic: \u201cI liked the idea of making and selling something locally,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a form of patriotism.\u201d\nWorking out of a rented commercial kitchen, Mr. Cunningham began experimenting \u2014 creating flavors like roasted strawberry and black lava caramel laced with Hawaiian black sea salt \u2014 and selling the results in pints to small markets. On weekends, the couple peddled their ice cream at street fairs.\nLast year, they decided they were ready for a brick-and-mortar retail presence with their own kitchen, so they opened a cafe near the Brooklyn Museum and called it Brooklyn Bell\u2019s the Local.\n\u201cIt allows me to make fresh batches as soon as we run out of a flavor,\u201d Mr. Cunningham said. \u201cBut now I seem to be working day and night.\u201d\nHe credits his mother, who joined the Navy when he was a child, for his work ethic and his culinary skills. \u201cShe wanted me to learn how to cook so I would literally \u2014 and these are her words \u2014 not depend on a woman to cook for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI even cooked dinner for my date for the senior prom instead of going to an expensive French restaurant.\u201d\nMs. Duncan-Cunningham, who grew up in rural Wisconsin, where her mother worked in a potato chip factory, is equally driven. After she became a single mother at 18, she put herself through college while raising her child; her daughter, Jade, is now 25 and a psychotherapist living in Kensington, Brooklyn.\n\u201cI\u2019m not ashamed to say it, but I was on welfare when I was in college,\u201d Ms. Duncan-Cunningham said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve paid in taxes since then has more than made up for it.\u201d\nAfter she moved to New York in 1999 to work at the white-shoe firm Fried Frank, and tried living in an apartment, she decided that she and Jade would be happier in a single-family house. That\u2019s when she began renting the three-bedroom place in Kensington, which she bought in 2005.\n\u201cYou hear six or seven languages, walking down the block. I told my mom it\u2019s like I\u2019m living on Sesame Street,\u201d she said, praising the neighborhood\u2019s friendliness and diversity. \u201cThe lady across the street gave me the hostas that are planted out front. My next-door neighbor is from Bangladesh, and during Ramadan she cooks so much that she will pass food to us over the backyard fence.\u201d\nWhen Mr. Cunningham moved in, merging their two households was relatively easy, she said, because \u201cRon is a minimalist.\u201d (It also helped that she had purged the house of excess possessions while helping her friend Brooks Palmer edit his book \u201cClutter Busting.\u201d)\nBut they cherish what they\u2019ve held onto: a collection of vintage Jet magazines that belonged to Mr. Cunningham\u2019s grandmother; the Bones Brigade Lance Mountain Future Primitive skateboard from the 1980s that inspired his tattoos; the toy airplane with an image of President Obama that Ms. Duncan-Cunningham got during his first inauguration; a $2 lamp she bought on the street in the East Village with an Andre the Giant drawing on the shade that looks as if had been autographed by the artist Shepard Fairey.\n\u201cI always wonder if he\u2019d like it back,\u201d Ms. Duncan-Cunningham said.\nIn the dining room, a de facto extension of their galley kitchen, wire shelves hold small appliances, cookbooks and canisters of sugar and flour. Ms. Duncan-Cunningham is a baker, and every few weeks she makes cakes for the cafe. She was once an avid gardener as well, tending dozens of heirloom tomato plants in the backyard, but these days the ice cream company consumes most of the couple\u2019s time and energy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been hard on our personal lives,\u201d she said.\nStill, they have found a way to make their 5-year-old daughter, Isabel, feel involved, Mr. Cunningham said: \u201cWe often bring Izzy to work with us. It\u2019s fun and educational. She counts the till and is learning about money.\u201d\nAnd at the end of a long day of scooping ice cream, where do they head? Right back to the kitchen.\n\u201cWe almost always cook dinner,\u201d Ms. Duncan-Cunningham said. \u201cOur lives would probably be easier if we didn\u2019t.\u201d",

    "text": "\u2018Odysseus Abroad,\u2019 by Amit Chaudhuri\n2015-05-15T15:22:31.000Z\nThe title of Amit Chaudhuri\u2019s sixth novel may use the Greek form of the ancient hero\u2019s name, but the predecessor he\u2019s got in mind for this story of two Bengalis wandering around London isn\u2019t so much the \u201cOdyssey\u201d as it is \u201cUlysses.\u201d Still, both Homer and Joyce begin the same way: with a young and callow man setting out in search of an absent father. Call him Telemachus, call him Stephen Dedalus. Or call him Ananda Sen, who in 1985 is studying English literature in Britain\u2019s capital and making a bad thing of it. He wants to be a poet, he likes Ted Hughes and Philip Larkin, and he has begun to learn that Shakespeare\u2019s language isn\u2019t so much universal as rooted in English particulars. In a country with India\u2019s weather, \u201cShall I compare thee to a summer\u2019s day\u201d sounds like an \u201cinsult\u201d; in England, it\u2019s a compliment.\nSome days Ananda manages to get himself to class, but he worries that his tutor, to whom he feels faintly superior, doesn\u2019t understand the \u201cspecial quality\u201d of his own poems, verses as derivative as those of Joyce\u2019s young man. He has made no friends and lives alone in a tiny apartment on the edge of Bloomsbury. Every so often he catches a glimpse of the young Englishwoman downstairs and finds himself smitten with lust. More often he\u2019s kept in a rage by the noise from the flat above, where two brothers, Gujaratis from another part of the Indian diaspora, seem to run a nonstop party. He feels superior to them as well, since they\u2019re only enrolled in business courses. Yet he knows little of London and lives mostly on Chinese takeout.\nTelemachus goes in search of his father, traveling through Greece and looking for what news he can find. Stephen Dedalus walks through Dublin to no great purpose, until he meets his symbolic parent, the wanderer Leopold Bloom, in one of the city\u2019s brothels. Ananda has nothing so colorful on tap, but he does have something more regular. His \u00aduncle, Radhesh, has spent much of his adult life in the city. Retired and living on a generous pension, he has as little with which to fill his days as Ananda himself.\nThe young man isn\u2019t sure he actually likes his uncle. They get \u201con each other\u2019s nerves,\u201d and every time they meet, Ananda finds himself exasperated by Radhesh\u2019s all-too-reliable announcement that he has put a full \u201c11 spoons of sugar\u201d in his morning cup of coffee and drunk \u201c10 glasses of water. .\u2008.\u2008. Flushes the system. You should try it.\u201d Nevertheless the \u201cfrisson\u201d has become necessary to each of them, and the uneventful days they spend together are the one regular feature of Ananda\u2019s life. The two will walk and eat and sometimes see a movie \u2014 James Bond if they\u2019re lucky, though on the day \u201cOdysseus Abroad\u201d is set all that\u2019s available is Bu\u00f1uel. And they will talk above all of home: of their ancestral city in what is now \u00adBangladesh, and of the parents Ananda so terribly misses.\nChaudhuri takes almost half the novel to get Ananda to his relative\u2019s door, though by the time Radhesh actually appears we \u00adalready know him well. This book may stick to a single day, but it so closely tracks the movement of Ananda\u2019s mind that it seems to offer us his entire emotional history, even going back, before he was born, to his parents\u2019 own days in London. His British tutors and his Indian music teacher, his wide reading and persistent indigestion, his fascination with Mrs. Thatcher and his deep ambivalence about Indian food in England \u2014 all that is here, along with a shrewd analysis of the \u00adcharacter of his uncle, a man who has never married because \u201cadministering a family would leave less time to talk about himself.\u201d\nThat inner life is not, \u00adhowever, presented in the jagged fragments of thought on which Joyce\u2019s stream of consciousness relied. Chaudhuri\u2019s prose is smoothly invisible, as underplayed as the action of the book as a whole. Most fiction deals with \u00adexceptional days, days on which something crucial happens. That\u2019s true even of \u201cUlysses,\u201d whose characters learn certain truths they haven\u2019t known before. But Ananda\u2019s day is just ordinary. Nothing \u00adchanges, and the novel ends with the two men simply planning to meet again the next Monday. So the book\u2019s success depends on just how interesting Ananda\u2019s lightly ironized mind seems as one reads from moment to moment.\nHe\u2019s young, but not a young jerk like Stephen Dedalus, and Chaudhuri never suggests that his suspended life is either typical or necessary. Ananda\u2019s loneliness and sense of isolation are rooted in his individual temperament and can\u2019t be written off as the consequence of his life abroad. He\u2019d like to see it that way, of course, and the novel does suggest that he will someday have to sort himself out. Yet while that cleareyed equipoise seems admirable, it also means the stakes \u00adremain low, for both the novel and the character. Teju Cole\u2019s 2011 novel \u201cOpen City,\u201d about another young wanderer in a foreign city, offers a good contrast, carrying both the sense of estrangement and the historical freight that this book lacks. \u201cOdysseus Abroad\u201d is an attractive wisp, a time capsule for anyone who knew the still scruffy London of the mid-1980s. Chaudhuri\u2019s readers will admire his skill \u2014 and wish this book were not, in the end, as bland as the British food of yore.",

    "text": "In Aftermath of East Village Blast, Business Owners Pledge to Rebuild\n2015-04-10T01:45:55.000Z\nThey knew each other in passing, as customers, as neighbors, linked only by the fact that their businesses shared the same few blocks of the East Village in Manhattan. \nBut on Thursday, as about a dozen owners of restaurants, clothing shops, dry-goods stores and other establishments either demolished, damaged or left financially crippled in the aftermath of the gas explosion that leveled three buildings on Second Avenue last month met, they shared something else: a desire to rebuild.\n\u201cWe\u2019re alive,\u201d said Roop Bring, the owner of Sam\u2019s Deli, a bodega that operated for decades on the ground floor of 123 Second Avenue in Manhattan before being destroyed as a result of the explosion, which, according to the authorities, erupted in the basement next door, at 121 Second Avenue. \u201cThat\u2019s what important.\u201d\nGathered in a corner at Caf\u00e9 Mocha, across Second Avenue from the crater created by the blast, other local business owners nodded in agreement. \ntranscript\nn/a\nSome, like Mr. Bring, had lost their businesses in the collapse that followed the blast and ensuing fire. Tarun Kundu\u2019s nearly 20-year-old copy shop, tucked around the corner, at 45 East 7th Street, was crushed when the building it occupied, 119 Second Avenue, came toppling down. \n\u201cI have nothing, in my store is everything,\u201d said Mr. Kundu, a Bangladeshi immigrant who has three daughters and lives in Woodside, Queens.\nEnz\u2019s, a store selling rockabilly-style clothing that opened in 1974 and was popular with the rock legends who prowled the East Village, is still standing, its exterior singed and dirty next to where backhoes continue to claw at the rubble. \nEnz\u2019s proprietor, Mariann Marlowe, said she had spent the days after the explosion trying to salvage what she could from the damaged store, one of the few in the neighborhood that remained closed. She said she was particularly intent on rescuing mannequins she had brought back from London in the 1980s, flying with them on her lap in the plane. \nTelling the group how Mr. Bring had run into her store in the moments after the blast and commanded her to flee as the shop filled with smoke, she became too overcome to speak.\n\u201cThis is part of East Village history,\u201d Ms. Marlow said to the group later. \u201cSome people might say, \u2018She is being hysterical over a mannequin.\u2019 But it\u2019s my life, it\u2019s not just clothes,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve created.\u201d\nFor the most part, the business owners seemed determined not to dwell on the past. Some, including Ms. Marlowe, had already begun to move forward: With the help of Made in Lower East Side, an organization that helps create \u201cpop-up\u201d shops, she had set up for the week at 103 Allen Street. \nOmer Shorshi, an owner of Pommes Frites, the Belgian-style French fry shop that shared a wall with Sam\u2019s Deli before the explosion, said he was looking for a new location, though the neighborhood\u2019s steep rents left him unsure about whether he could afford to be there anymore.\nSeveral restaurants in the area have been unable to open, because they have no gas. A spokeswoman for Consolidated Edison said on Thursday that the utility was prepared to restore gas service to the affected buildings once the required inspections and tests were completed.\nFawzy Abdelwahed, the owner of B & H, a 73-year-old kosher restaurant at 127 Second Avenue, said he was paying his employees, though they had not been able to work since the explosion and fire. A website created to raise money for the shop had collected nearly $5,000 by Thursday. \nThe business owners shared tips on how to set up similar websites. Also on hand were several community activists who listened and offered advice. One initiative that came up, promoted by the group #SaveNYC, calls on people to shop at the affected businesses. For example, a \u201ccash mob\u201d is being urged to convene at noon on Saturday at Gem Spa, a venerable East Village shop that sells, among other things, old-fashioned egg creams. \nFor those who lost everything, like Chas Bring, Roop Bring\u2019s son, there is nothing to gain from such an effort. The younger Mr. Bring said he would juggle shifts at Sam\u2019s Deli with his brother when they were not in class at Hunter College, but he could do little at the meeting but listen.\n\u201cMy brother and I used to fight over who would have to go to work that day,\u201d he said. \u201cNow this happened, and I wish I could go.\u201d",

    "text": "The Power of Hope Is Real\n2015-05-21T07:21:21.000Z\nAn awkward truth for bleeding hearts like myself is that there has never been much rigorous evidence that outside aid can sustainably lift people out of poverty.\nSure, evidence is overwhelming that aid can overcome disease, boost literacy and save lives. But raising incomes is trickier \u2014 and the evidence in that arena has been squishier.\nNow that\u2019s changing. A vast randomized trial \u2014 the gold standard of evidence \u2014 involving 21,000 people in six countries suggests that a particular aid package called the graduation program (because it aims to graduate people from poverty) gives very poor families a significant boost that continues after the program ends. Indeed, it\u2019s an investment. In India, the economic return was a remarkable 433 percent.\nThe heart of this aid package? A cow. Or a few goats. Even bees.\nWhy would a cow have such an impact? This gets interesting: There\u2019s some indication that one mechanism is hope. Whether in America or India, families that are stressed and impoverished \u2014 trapped in cycles of poverty \u2014 can feel a hopelessness that becomes self-fulfilling. Give people reason to hope that they can achieve a better life, and that, too, can be self-fulfilling.\nIn the graduation program, recipients of livestock were inspired to work more hours, even in areas unrelated to the livestock. They took more odd jobs. Their savings rose. Their mental health improved.\n\u201cPoverty is not just poverty of money or income,\u201d noted Sir Fazle Abed, founder of a Bangladeshi aid group called BRAC that developed the graduation program. \u201cWe also see a poverty of self-esteem, hope, opportunity and freedom. People trapped in a cycle of destitution often don\u2019t realize their lives can be changed for the better through their own activities. Once they understand that, it\u2019s like a light gets turned on.\u201d\nEsther Duflo, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a co-author of the study, believes that\u2019s right. \u201cThe mental health part is absolutely critical,\u201d she said. \u201cPoverty causes stress and depression and lack of hope, and stress and depression and lack of hope, in turn, cause poverty.\u201d\nCould hopelessness and stress create a \u201cpoverty trap\u201d \u2014 abroad or here in the U.S. \u2014 in which people surrender to a kind of whirlpool of despair? Some economists and psychologists are finding evidence to support that theory, and experiments are underway to see if raising spirits can lift economic outcomes.\nOne study found that Ethiopians randomly assigned to watch an hourlong inspirational video ended up saving more and spending more on their children\u2019s education, compared with participants randomly assigned to watch an hour of comedy television. The forward-leaning behaviors persisted in a six-month follow-up.\nResearchers are now studying whether exposure to religion might have a similar effect, improving economic outcomes. If so, Marx had the wrong drug in mind: religion would not be an opiate of the masses but an amphetamine.\nThe graduation program is a bit similar to the model of the well-known group Heifer International, which I\u2019ve written about before and provides \u201cgifts of hope\u201d such as heifers, goats and chickens to impoverished families. \u201cThere was a lot of excitement \u2014 with just a hint of smugness! \u2014 at Heifer at the published results,\u201d said Pierre Ferrari, the president of Heifer. But the graduation model includes a couple of other elements.\nThe graduation program starts with a cow or other animals, as well as training on how to raise them. It includes months of food or cash support, partly to reduce the need to eat or sell the animal in a financial crisis. There\u2019s a savings account (microlending has disappointed in randomized trials, but microsaving works very well), health education and regular coaching to reinforce skills and build confidence.\nThe study, which was just published in the journal Science, found that the graduation model was enormously successful in India, Ethiopia, Ghana and Pakistan, and somewhat less effective in Peru and in Honduras (where some animals died). A follow-up found the effects still strong three years after the donation of the animals.\nDean Karlan, a Yale economist who is co-author of the study, said that aid groups focused on very similar approaches include Trickle Up, the Boma Project, Village Enterprise and Fonkoze. Professor Karlan\u2019s students in a seminar on philanthropy were given a pool of money from a foundation and the challenge to donate it where it would do the most good; they spent the term reviewing the evidence and, in the end, voted to donate it to Trickle Up.\nSo bleeding hearts, rejoice! \nMuch of the news about global poverty is depressing, but this is fabulous: a large-scale experiment showing, with rigorous evidence, what works to lift people out of the most extreme poverty. And it\u2019s exhilarating that one of the lessons may be so simple and human: the power of hope. ",

    "text": "Greek \u2018No\u2019 May Have Its Roots in Heroic Myths and Real Resistance\n2015-07-07T00:12:40.000Z\nATHENS \u2014 In the early 1800s, Greek fighters rebelled against their Ottoman overlord by blowing themselves up instead of submitting to captivity. In the mountains of Zalongo, by legend, women flung their children off a cliff and then danced off after them rather than be sold as slaves.\nIn October of 1940, Greece boldly defied an Italian ultimatum, prompting Mussolini to invade from the north. While fighting gallantly, beating the Italians back into Albania, the Greeks were eventually undone by the advance of Nazi troops from Bulgaria. By June of 1941, the Axis occupation was complete.\nWhether Greeks\u2019 overwhelming rejection on Sunday of the latest European loan deal proves to be a master stroke or a monumental blunder remains to be seen. What is clear, experts and analysts say, is that it sprang from a deep cultural and historical strain of defiance in apparently hopeless situations, honed over centuries under Ottoman rule and nurtured by the telling of heroic tales from one generation to another.\n\u201cIt is true that deep in the Greek psyche is the idea of glorious resistance against all odds,\u201d said Nick Malkoutzis, the editor of Macropolis, a political analysis website.\nSunday\u2019s \u201cno\u201d vote had to do with the recent past, Mr. Malkoutzis said, with people feeling penned in by the policies of the last five years and finally being given a chance to express themselves. But such moments, he said, are \u201cwritten into the conscience of every Greek.\u201d\nSometimes, Mr. Malkoutzis said, that resistance had made for great victories in Greek history, like the War of Greek Independence, beginning in 1821 against the Ottoman Empire. And sometimes for colossal defeats, as at the hands of the Nazis and Mussolini in World War II.\nWhen thousands of Greeks descended on Syntagma Square to celebrate the vote, many said they were not at all convinced that it would aid their situation. But it was time to fight back.\nMost schoolchildren here are brought up on stories of resistance, some of which were invoked last week in trying to drum up resistance to European demands, whatever the consequences.\nThanos Veremis, historian emeritus at the University of Athens, said the Greeks love these stories because they strike a chord for a small country that has been dominated by a series of outside powers \u2014 the latest, in Greek eyes, being the European Union.\nThey are fighting the War of Independence all over again, he said, \u201cstanding up against the European Union.\u201d\nEven in recent times, Greece has nurtured a culture of protests. The generation governing Greece today was raised on images of angry students barricading themselves inside the Athens Polytechnic in a bloody demonstration against the military junta that ruled Greece from 1967 to 1974.\nEuropean authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.\nGreek life is full of everyday strikes that have routinely shut down ferries to the islands, mass transit and taxis, among other things. Experts say that tax evasion developed as resistance to the Ottoman occupiers.\nWhile they might have been resisting when they voted no on Sunday, the vast majority of Greeks want to remain in the union, polls show.\nEvi Prousali, a theater critic who was among those celebrating in Syntagma on Sunday night, said Monday that she appreciated the richness of the varied European cultures.\nShe said she was not rebelling against her fellow Europeans, but against the political and business elite who are ignoring the will not just of Greeks, but of most other Europeans as well.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the people,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s the international companies, the international banks, the European banking system. Germany and France are going to govern all Europe, as before the Second World War. It\u2019s another kind of colonization.\u201d\nOn Monday, in the aftermath of the vote, a kind of collective hangover mentality took over, as Greeks waited to see what the future would bring.\nThe provocative finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, resigned, opening the way for a more moderate voice. A national unity government was taking shape, but it was unclear whether that would keep Syriza, the governing party, in a more compromising mood or determined still to resist their creditors\u2019 demands.\nMore cautious voices warned that the creditors were not likely to restructure Greece\u2019s debt without concessions, and some analysts said the no vote could be costly.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know what poverty is,\u201d Dr. Veremis said. \u201cWhen people tell me it can\u2019t get worse, I say of course it can. There\u2019s Bangladesh and there\u2019s Zambia, and there\u2019s Liberia and there\u2019s a host of countries that are much worse than Greece was and will be, which is what people don\u2019t realize.\u201d\nFew Greeks were regretting their no choice, however, even after watching a day of television, which provided back-to-back meetings of various eurozone officials, few of them having much encouraging to say for Greece.\nTheodoris Sourdis, 38, who was sitting in his electronics repair shop in Athens, said that voting no felt good and offered a sliver of hope for a better deal. Business has been so bad lately that he can barely afford food. On Monday, the phone rang twice.\n\u201cIt was a mix of being fed up and a slice of hope that something could change,\u201d Mr. Sourdis said of the vote. \u201cIt was a matter of pride, too.\u201d\nBut he added with a slight shrug that he had spent the day listening to the radio, and that the news made it \u201csound like exactly nothing had changed. Just another day of negotiations.\u201d",

    "text": "Volunteers, Many Once Refugees Themselves, Help as Guides in Vienna \n2015-09-24T22:46:12.000Z\nVIENNA \u2014 At the migration center in the east wing of the main train station here, Ragad al-Rachid, a petite 19-year-old psychology student and a Syrian Muslim, is immersed in the logistical details of helping dozens of people a day adjust to new lives in her adopted country.\nShe shouts directions to the makeshift kitchen in Arabic, points people to a registration desk and a lawyer to advise them on legal ways to stay in Austria, gets local SIM cards for the new arrivals, helps them connect to the free Wi-Fi at the station and shows them how to buy tickets for trains to Germany and beyond.\nOften she just sits with refugees and listens to them talk about their experiences.\nBut even as she spends her days helping the thousands of people transiting through the Austrian capital, she said, she is also benefiting. As one of dozens of Arabic-speaking Muslims among the 2,000 or so volunteers here who tend to refugees, she has for the first time since coming to Vienna found herself among Austrians who \u201clook like me and think like me,\u201d she said.\nAs Europe absorbs the multitudes heading its way from the Middle East and Africa, it has often left unresolved the integration of earlier waves of Muslims. In Germany, it was the Turks. In France, the Algerians. But all across the Continent, Muslims are in various stages of acceptance, and the young, in particular, have been seeking ways to fit in.\nMs. Rachid\u2019s family\u2019s story illustrates the recent arc of the exodus from the Middle East into Europe.\nShe arrived in Austria this year. One of her uncles sought asylum in France, and another is waiting for his residency papers in Sweden. Two of her aunts are being processed in Germany, and a third is in Austria, where Ms. Rachid, her parents and a younger brother are also seeking asylum.\nJust last week, nine months after they officially requested international protection here, they obtained a decree allowing them to remain in the Alpine nation of 8.7 million people. \n\u201cIt\u2019s been really tough on my family, but we are the lucky ones because we have the means to support ourselves in the waiting period,\u201d Ms. Rachid said. Her father owns a business in Nigeria.\nGerman and European Union leaders have called for European countries to share the burden of absorbing the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have poured into the continent this summer.\nWith the war in Syria raging into its fifth year, the family has not been back to its home in the Damascus suburb of Mouadamiya, an opposition stronghold that has been under government siege.\nBut while Ms. Rachid longs to return to Syria, the country has come to her through the Syrians who descend every day from trains at Vienna\u2019s Hauptbahnhof, exhausted by the journey through the Balkans, traumatized by the past in their war-wrecked homeland and fearful of a future in exile.\n\u201cI think about these stories a lot,\u201d Ms. Rachid said. \u201cI\u2019ve had sleepless nights, and the hardest thing for me now is the realization that my country is gone.\u201d\nIt is the refugees\u2019 questions about Austria that she has the hardest time answering. Does she like Austria? How long does it take to get asylum, and how long before they can bring the family over? Should they go on to Germany?\nShe struggles with a reply because she knows it is a long process in Austria, and most of the refugees landing here now do not have the means to support themselves while they wait.\nThe asylum policy is being amended constantly because applications for international protection in Austria have risen sharply. In the past three days, the Interior Ministry has registered a record number of requests \u2014 500 to 700 applications a day, compared with 100 to 150 at this time last year. By the end of September, officials expect more than 9,000 asylum applications on their books, compared with 3,000 in March.\nHer advice to refugees often is to move to Germany \u2014 and not just because Austria\u2019s list of asylum seekers has grown so long.\n\u201cI feel strange here sometimes, maybe because of my head scarf,\u201d Ms. Rachid said. \u201cPeople are always staring at me.\u201d\nShe is particularly uncomfortable taking Vienna\u2019s underground commuter trains. \u201cWhenever I enter the metro, I see people stiffing up, pulling away from me slightly, and I think, \u2018Oh, no, what did I do?\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nMs. Rachid, who has not mastered German, said she tried to limit her movements around Vienna to the apartment her family is renting in a middle-class district, to a supermarket across the street and to a private university, where is taking English-language courses in psychology.\nAnd to the east wing of the train station, where the migration center has sprung up as a primary service point for the thousands pouring through.\nThis week, trains kept pulling in, each with 150 to 350 exhausted and nervous migrants, from the Hungarian border. On a recent day, volunteers counted nearly a thousand people at the station in their care.\nEarlier in this crisis, Austria was heavily criticized for the appalling conditions of its refugee centers in the border areas. Protests for better treatment occurred this month, and a group of people broke away from the official collection centers and established their own refugee relief effort.\nWithin three weeks, one effort, known as Train of Hope, was established at Vienna\u2019s main train station. It is now on par with the refugee center run by an Austrian Christian charity, Caritas, in the capital\u2019s oldest station, the Westbahnhof.\nStarting with a few boxes of clothing and a shopping cart full of medicine, a core group of eight volunteers, all in their 20s, initiated the relief effort in a corridor of the train terminal\u2019s east wing.\nNow they have a clinic with two beds; closets stacked with medicines and first aid and hygiene kits; and X-ray and ultrasound machines. There are six doctors and four nurses by day, two of each at night. There is a makeshift kitchen and dining area, a restroom with several toilets at the entrance to the station and a tented area that is organized as a bazaar for migrants to choose from donated clothes.\nThere is also a missing-persons desk and a legal-advisers desk with two volunteers who talk about asylum policies and onward journeys with migrants. Elsewhere, SIM cards are handed out, and free food and snacks are available at every corner.\nAnother volunteer, Monika Alamgir, a 24-year-old Austrian of Indian and Bangladeshi origin, said she could relate to Ms. Rachid\u2019s feelings as an outsider. Ms. Alamgir was born in Vienna to a Muslim family and has a degree in Islamic education. She has four sisters, and three of them, along with their mother, cover their hair with head scarves.\nThe latest E.U. proposal addresses just a fraction of a human crisis numbering in the millions.\n\u201cI like it here, but it is different. People perceive you differently here if you wear a hijab,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are a Muslim, visibly, and not everyone likes us.\u201d\nBut Ms. Alamgir said she had a good life in Austria, where her father, a journalist, sought asylum nearly three decades ago, when he was forced to flee Bangladesh. \n\u201cI consider myself and my family fortunate because we are safe here and we have all we need,\u201d Ms. Alamgir said. \u201cI want to help others now because I know how it is to be in their place, in danger and with no money left.\u201d\nTrain of Hope lists its needs on a Facebook page that has more than 40,000 fans, and through its Twitter account, which has more than 5,500 followers. It also now oversees seven halls, industrial spaces and an indoor sports stadium that it has turned into sleeping areas.\n\u201cWhat we do here is try to have people who have been through hell smile again \u2014 let them know they are safe with us,\u201d said Ashley Winkler, 24, a graphic designer from the southern Austrian city of Graz, who quit her job at an ad agency to help found and run Train of Hope.\n\u201cThe City of Vienna supports us, but not the federal government,\u201d Ms. Winkler said. \u201cThey should, though. We are doing their job without any pay.\u201d\nMs. Alamgir\u2019s main task at the train station is to coordinate hundreds of volunteers, many of them refugees themselves or descendants of previous generations of asylum seekers. It is essential they speak German, Ms. Alamgir said, but the languages most in demand are Arabic, Persian, Urdu and Kurdish.\nWhat is most needed is for the volunteers to know and understand what the refugees are going through, Ms. Alamgir said. \n\u201cIt does not matter what language you speak, I tell volunteers,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to be kind and loving to these people who have been through so much.\u201d ",

    "text": "Sunnyside, Queens, \u2018Mayberry\u2019 Near Midtown\n2015-03-18T12:59:11.000Z\nSunnyside, in western Queens, is a stark contrast to the gleaming glass residential towers rising in nearby Long Island City. Here is an old-fashioned New York neighborhood of squat prewar apartment buildings, rowhouses and shopping streets that still have mom-and-pop businesses.\n\u201cWe call it Mayberry,\u201d after the small town portrayed in the 1960s sitcom \u201cThe Andy Griffith Show,\u201d said Amy FitzGerald, the owner of Welcome Home Real Estate on Skillman Avenue in Sunnyside.\n\u201cPeople are very friendly,\u201d said Ms. FitzGerald, who moved to the neighborhood with her husband 16 years ago from Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side.\nCiaran Staunton, a resident since 2001 and the owner of Molly Blooms pub in Sunnyside, said residents were quick to rally around community issues such as repaving a local street. \u201cPeople come together because this is a good neighborhood and we want to keep it good,\u201d he said.\nSunnyside\u2019s boundaries correspond roughly with those of ZIP code 11104, an area of nearly one-half square mile with a population of around 27,000. The neighborhood is perhaps best known for its Sunnyside Gardens Historic District, one of the first planned communities in the United States. Built between 1924 and 1928, this enclave feels like an old English town, with its gabled brick townhouses, verdant courtyards and pathways weaving between buildings.\nStrolling along the streets of the Gardens district, one might imagine that time had stopped somewhere back in the early 20th century, but that would be an illusion. Sunnyside has not been immune to change brought about by a growing interest in Queens among New Yorkers priced out of Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn. Property prices and rents have been rising in recent years, real estate agents say.\nJanet Gallagher, 68, a retired lawyer, is among the recent arrivals. A longtime renter in Park Slope, Brooklyn, she found herself out of a lease five years ago and looking for a new place to live. After renting in Sunnyside, she recently bought a one-bedroom co-op there that she plans to move into soon. \u201cIt looked like a viable, real neighborhood with a very mixed population, and it\u2019s convenient to Manhattan,\u201d Ms. Gallagher said.\nWhile Sunnyside retains some of its identity as a historically Irish-American neighborhood, it has a broader mix these days. A 2013 Department of City Planning report, \u201cThe Newest New Yorkers,\u201d said foreign-born residents of the area encompassing Sunnyside, Hunters Point and West Maspeth included Ecuadorean, Colombian, Chinese, Korean, Bangladeshi and Mexican immigrants.\nMore change may be coming to Sunnyside. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced during his State of the City address last month a plan to build more than 11,000 units of affordable housing at Sunnyside Yards, the rail depot adjacent to the neighborhood.\nCity Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, whose district includes Sunnyside and who lives in Sunnyside Gardens, said residents were \u201crightly concerned\u201d about the effect of such a project on services like the already crowded No. 7 subway train.\n\u201cJust about every Sunnysider needs to get on that 7 train\u201d for work, he said, \u201cand it is increasingly unreliable.\u201d\nWhat You\u2019ll Find\nReal estate in Sunnyside is predominantly a mix of six-story apartment buildings from the early 1940s, many of which have been converted into co-ops and condominiums, and attached rowhouses of varying sizes. Inventory is extremely tight. A search on March 12 of the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, which includes Queens, showed 15 properties for sale in Sunnyside.\n\u201cCompetition for whatever comes available is fierce,\u201d said Nilo De la Torre, a real estate agent with Century 21 Sunny Gardens Realty. One-bedroom co-ops and condos are the most widely available. Larger apartments and houses are more scarce, Ms. FitzGerald said, especially in the Sunnyside Gardens district.\nWhat You\u2019ll Pay\nThe high demand for properties has steadily pushed up prices. For example, Ms. FitzGerald said one-bedroom co-ops \u2014 now selling for up to $325,000 \u2014 were going for $250,000 a couple of years ago. Studios that sold for $110,000 are now fetching up to $175,000, she said.\nIn the Sunnyside Gardens area, single-family, three-bedroom townhouses are selling in the low $800,000s, and two-family townhomes in the mid-$900,000s; the very rare three-family home to come on the market can sell for up to $1.2 million, Ms. FitzGerald said.\nOutside Sunnyside Gardens, home prices range from around $700,000 for a single-family home to $850,000 for a two-family house to about $1 million for a three-family rowhouse, she said.\nRental prices, too, have risen, said Mr. De la Torre. One-bedroom apartments typically rent for between $1,750 to $2,100 a month, compared with $1,600 to $1,800 a month three years ago, he said. \u201cMany people who have lived in Sunnyside for a while wouldn\u2019t be able to afford their apartments if they started looking for something now.\u201d\nWhat To Do\nAlong busy Queens Boulevard, residents can find a Starbucks, a White Castle fast-food restaurant and a Key Food Fresh \u2019n\u2019 Save Marketplace. More commercial activity happens along Greenpoint Avenue and on Skillman Avenue, which are filled with local food markets, restaurants and bars, coffee shops and other small businesses. \u201cThere is no shortage of places to meet people and hang out,\u201d Ms. Gallagher said.\nThe Thalia Spanish Theater, on Greenpoint Avenue, is bilingual, sometimes alternating performances in English and Spanish, and also presents music and dance.\nThe community comes out for annual events like the St. Pat\u2019s For All parade, held in early March. Residents also congregate at the Greenmarket on Skillman Avenue and at local playgrounds.\nWhat the neighborhood lacks is a large public park. Sunnyside Gardens Park, a three-and-a-half-acre private park, is open to membership by residents of Sunnyside Gardens only.\nThe Schools\nIn September, Sunnyside welcomed a new elementary school, Public School 343 the Children\u2019s Lab School, with prekindergarten and kindergarten offered this first year. Additional grades will be added each year until the school serves students through Grade 5.\nOther schools in Sunnyside include P.S. 150 Queens, which offers a gifted and talented program. It has around 1,240 students in prekindergarten through Grade 6. Results from the Department of Education\u2019s 2013-2014 Elementary School Quality Snapshot showed 43 percent of its students met state standards in English, compared with 30 percent citywide, and 63 percent met state standards in math, compared with 39 percent citywide.\nThe other large public elementary school in the neighborhood is P.S. 199 Maurice A. Fitzgerald School, which has around 1,000 students in kindergarten through Grade 5. Its Quality Snapshot showed 33 percent of the students met state standards in English and 50 percent met state math standards.\nThe Commute\nThe No. 7 subway train serves the neighborhood at two stations \u2014 40th Street-Lowery Street and 46th Street-Bliss Street. A trip from the 46th Street-Bliss Street station to Grand Central Terminal takes 15 to 20 minutes.\nManhattan-bound No. 7 trains, especially during the morning commute, are often packed by the time they get to Sunnyside. Residents also have had to contend recently with weekend service shutdowns for track repairs and signal upgrades.\nThe History\nThe architects of Sunnyside Gardens were influenced by the English garden city movement, with its ideals of \u201chealth, open space, greenery, and idyllic community living for all,\u201d according to \u201cThe Encyclopedia of New York City.\u201d In the 1940s, the Gardens district attracted artists and writers who moved there from Manhattan to raise families, and the area became known as the \u201cmaternity ward of Greenwich Village.\u201d",

    "text": "Crisis at Sea\n2015-05-14T07:21:06.000Z\nOne of the world\u2019s most beautiful regions, the seas of Southeast Asia \u2014 home to sparkling white beaches and $7,000-a-night beach villas \u2014 is becoming a scene of a mass atrocity.\nThousands of refugees from the persecuted Rohingya minority in Myanmar, fleeing modern concentration camps at home, have fled to sea in boats, and many have drowned. Fearing a crackdown, smugglers have abandoned some of those boats at sea, and neighboring countries are pushing the boats back to sea when they try to land.\nThe Obama administration, which has regarded Myanmar as one of its diplomatic successes, is largely unhelpful as this calamity unfolds.\n\u201cThe Andaman Sea is about to become a floating mass grave, and it\u2019s because of the failure of governments, including our own, to do what is necessary,\u201d says Tom Andrews, a former member of Congress who is president of United to End Genocide. \u201cNot only is there not a search-and-rescue operation going on right now \u2014 with thousands out to sea \u2014 but governments are towing these people out from their shores back to open sea, which is tantamount to mass murder.\u201d\nOne appalling chapter of World War II came when the SS St. Louis left Germany in 1939 full of Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazis. Cuba and the United States barred them from disembarking, and \u2014 after passing so close to Miami that passengers could see the lights on shore \u2014 the ship returned to Europe, where many died in the Holocaust.\nA collection of stories from a recent trip focusing on a Muslim minority who are confined to camps and villages. UPDATED June 20: Nicholas Kristof responds to readers\u2019 questions.\nNow refugees fleeing concentration camps are again denied landfall.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a flotilla of St. Louises, and people are going to die,\u201d Andrews told me.\nRohingyas are a Muslim minority reviled by the majority Buddhist population in Myanmar. The government has confined some 150,000 of them to 21st-century concentration camps: I visited these camps last year and wrote about starving children and camp inmates dying for lack of medical care.\nOn Wednesday, there were unconfirmed reports of 20 Rohingya-owned shops being burned down in Maungdaw in western Myanmar near the border with Bangladesh. \nThe United Nations says that more than 130,000 Rohingyas have fled by sea since 2012. Many fall prey to human smugglers who torture, rape and starve them in Thai camps until relatives pay ransom. The discovery of a mass grave this month from one such camp embarrassed Thai authorities into cracking down on human smugglers, leading the crews to abandon the ships, with their human cargo adrift at sea.\nChris Lewa of The Arakan Project, a human rights group, said she has been in cellphone contact with two ships full of refugees, and she suspects that there are more farther from land and thus out of cellphone range. One is drifting without engines or adequate food, and she, as a private citizen, has been frantically trying to organize a search-and-rescue effort to save the passengers \u2014 so far, unsuccessfully.\nCome on! If a suspected terrorist were on board, intelligence agencies would use that cellphone number to locate that boat. But 350 desperate refugees adrift at sea, and we\u2019re going to shrug and let them drown?\nGovernments are probably uninterested in rescuing refugees for fear that they would then have to take them in. Thailand has long had a policy of sending refugee boats on their way, and Indonesia this week pushed two ships carrying hundreds of Rohingya back to sea. As for Malaysia, \u201cwe won\u2019t let any foreign boats come in,\u201d an admiral said.\nEurope also has a refugee crisis, but at least European countries are mounting search-and-rescue operations to try to save lives. What Southeast Asian governments are doing is the opposite.\nAs a first step, President Obama should call the leaders of Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, urging them to rescue and shelter refugees. The United States can also use military and intelligence assets to locate drifting refugee ships and assist with search and rescue.\nObama must also make clear that Myanmar cannot have a normal relationship with the United States as long as it engages in crimes against humanity. Just this month, the administration welcomed to the White House a senior official of the Myanmar government, Thura Shwe Mann, who has allied himself with extremist anti-Rohingya positions. In its statement afterward, the White House\u2019s press office even avoided using the word \u201cRohingya,\u201d apparently so as not to offend Myanmar.\nThat\u2019s craven, but what\u2019s worse is the way American and Asian officials alike seem determined to avert their eyes from atrocities in one of the world\u2019s most beautiful regions.\n\u201cPeople are dying at sea,\u201d said Matthew Smith of Fortify Rights, a human rights group that has done excellent work monitoring the Rohingya. \u201cWe know that, right now. And it could worsen considerably in the coming weeks.\u201d ",

    "text": "In Mauritius, Gourmet Rice Points to a Brighter Future\n2015-10-19T14:11:09.000Z\nRIVI\u00c8RE DES ANGUILLES, Mauritius \u2014 In tropical Mauritius, where the change of seasons is muted, the blooming sugar cane flower is a sure indicator of the beginning of another autumn.\nThe sugar cane and its seasonal fireworks \u2014 a sudden explosion of dusty color just above the 3-meter-high, or 10-foot-high, cane \u2014 have been a big part of island life since the 17th century. Dutch colonizers started growing sugar cane for the production of arrack, a strong, clear, distilled liquor they had discovered in Southeast Asia.\nSugar became the island\u2019s biggest industry \u2014 first as raw material for distillers, then as a commodity shipped around the world. Even into the 1970s, sugar represented roughly 95 percent of Mauritian gross domestic product, and cane was grown on a third of the island\u2019s land.\nBut fierce global competition, the rise of new cane-growing superpowers \u2014 China, Pakistan and Brazil \u2014 and waning preferred treatment from the European market have taken their toll on sugar prices. Although still grown on about a fourth of the island, sugar this year will represent only about 1 percent of the island\u2019s G.D.P.\nThis perfect storm is leading sugar cane farmers here to look for ways to shore up their income, and their future. While some smaller farmers have simply abandoned their land, larger commercial farms are starting to look for alternatives \u2014 from tourism to real estate sales to, increasingly, higher-value crops that can be sold around the world at premium prices.\n\u201cNo one is talking about giving up sugar,\u201d said Michael Teig Rountree, who runs Bel Air, a 390-hectare, or 965-acre, sugar farm that has been in his family since his ancestors emigrated from Ireland in the early 19th century. \u201cSugar cane has had its ups and downs. But it\u2019s quite different this time.\u201d\nHaving tried livestock feeds like alfalfa, soybeans and corn, Mr. Rountree, whose farm sits on the lush southern side of the island, stumbled on something promising: a premium rice, destined for health-conscious and well-off consumers in Europe and the United States.\nWhile Mighty Rice, as it is called, was developed by cross-pollination in Bangladesh, its slick black-and-white packaging exalts the volcanic soil and rain-fed streams of Mauritius \u2014 marketing the benefits of the place it is grown as much as the food.\nThe rice, which is grown on dry land and so can be easily integrated into traditional farms, yields between four and six tons per hectare at a fixed price to farmers of $800 per ton, earning them as much as $4,800 per hectare. Sugar, by contrast, has an average yield of eight tons per hectare. At this year\u2019s price of $360 a ton, that comes to $2,880 per hectare.\nThe retail price for Mighty Rice is higher as well. On the shelves of the California supermarket chain Raley\u2019s, a 15-ounce bag sells for $4.99, which is seven to eight times more than the price for the same quantity of white cane sugar in the same store.\n\u201cWhen we started growing rice here, the people thought we were insane,\u201d said Herman Suhirman of Vita Rice, a Mauritian company that started growing Mighty Rice in 2009 on its own 400-hectare farm, which was formerly the site of a state-owned sugar farm. This year\u2019s harvest will be his third to be available commercially, and already there are early signs of success. The company has produced 1,470 tons of rice in one year and is poised to sell some 40,000 15-ounce bags in the United States \u2014 so far its main export market.\nThe rice carries a certification guaranteeing that it is not genetically modified and free of arsenic \u2014 the latter a potential contaminate in other commercially available rice.\nWhile the rice is not yet certified as organic, Mauritian rice farmers are taking no chances, fertilizing their fields with molasses to avoid anything that could affect the end product.\n\u201cWe are looking for soft options\u201d for pest control and fertilization, said Bill Hoare, an Australian who runs Vita Rice\u2019s rice farm. \u201cIt\u2019s cheaper and it\u2019s better for the rice.\u201d\nPremium rice is just one of the products farmers around the world are using to replace commodity crops, said Luis A. Ribera, a professor in the Department of Agriculture at Texas A&M University. The state of Tamaulipas in Mexico, for example, has all but abandoned dry hay, corn and other row crops for irrigated vegetables destined for supermarket shelves in the United States. In some cases vegetables replacing row crops or cane in Central and South America are grown organically and sold at a premium.\n\u201cAs crop land is reducing, population is increasing and purchasing power from both developed and developing countries is on the rise, more and more emphasis is given to demand-driven production,\u201d Mr. Ribera wrote in an email.\nSophie Desvaux de Marigny, the head of communication at Medine, once one of the largest commercial sugar plantations in Mauritius, agreed. When a case brought to the World Trade Organization in 2004 first threatened the guaranteed price of Mauritian sugar on the European market, Medine, which owns farmland covering 5 percent of the island, decided to revamp its business, establishing separate property and leisure clusters and detailing a 25-year master plan.\nAlthough Medine\u2019s sugar and rum are still exported \u2014 the company is even actively reclaiming fallow land to expand its agriculture division \u2014 it now grows vegetables for local consumption, rents out office space, runs a resort village and attracts international tourists to its nature safari park.\n\u201cAt this point you want to produce something value-added,\u201d Ms. Desvaux de Marigny said.\nThe Mauritius Sugar Syndicate, which represents local sugar growers and millers abroad, has invested in marketing so-called special sugars \u2014 various shades and grain sizes of brown cane sugar \u2014 that can be sold directly to consumers and commands a premium price.\nLately the syndicate has been promoting Fairtrade sugar, of which it hopes to export 40,000 tons next year, a little less than 10 percent of all Mauritian sugar sold abroad. \u201cThe next phase is going to be all about sustainability,\u201d said Devesh Dukhira, who runs the syndicate.\nNow in his second year of growing Mighty Rice, Mr. Rountree has planted about 63 hectares of the crop on his farm. The rice, which stands no taller than half a meter when fully mature, is dwarfed by the surrounding cane, but it allows the passer-by to look out past the field to palm trees, mountains and the light-blue Indian Ocean.\nRemarking how nice such a view must appear to tourists, Mr. Rountree said: \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if the rice is a solution for problems we didn\u2019t even know we had.\u201d",

    "text": "Superheroes: Born in New York City\n2015-10-15T18:18:27.000Z\nOh man, there was nothing quite like fifth-grade comics love.\nI would hustle down the stairs at P.S. 166 and trot with my buddy Peter to the soda and newsstand at 91st Street and Broadway. We\u2019d squeeze past old Viennese ladies drinking coffee and the white-haired couple who owned the place. Bunched on a low rack were the latest comic books, with Batman, Legion of Super-Heroes (Saturn Girl!), Superman and Spider-Man.\nWe plunked down a pile of quarters and darted down Broadway, working out how we would sneak our troves past our parents, who imagined we\u2019d be better off reading novels. In a fashion we only half intuited, we were reading about New York in all its disguises.\nPeter Parker, whose alter ego was Spider-Man, lived in Queens. Clark Kent worked for The Daily Planet in Metropolis. Please. We assumed that these were just cover names for The Daily News and New York.\nAnd there was Batman, whose loss and menace and darkness spoke to our beloved dystopia, which is to say the New York of the late 1960s and \u201970s, a place of light and many shadows.\nYears later, I began to write a Metro column for The New York Times. I titled it Gotham.\nNow the New-York Historical Society has mounted a homage to this world: \u201cSuperheroes in Gotham.\u201d The curators found in a private collection the Pow! Bam! Wham! Pop Art-era Batmobile and put it in the lobby. They mounted the Penguin\u2019s umbrella and Catwoman\u2019s hot unitard upstairs, along with Action Comics No. 1 (the first appearance of Superman) and art originals of the singular Steve Ditko\u2019s Spider-Man.\nThe exhibition focuses on comic book founding fathers. They were predominantly Jewish kids \u2014 with a few Italians and the occasional wayward Protestant mixed in \u2014 from the Bronx, the Lower East Side and Brooklyn. And in the 1930s and \u201940s, they created a world.\nBob Kane (born Robert Kahn), a creator of Batman, and Will Eisner, a son of Jewish immigrants and the creator of the Spirit, attended DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, as did the wisenheimer bard Stan Lee (born Stanley Lieber), who created the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, the Hulk and many more.\nMr. Lee\u2019s collaborator was the illustrator Jack Kirby (born Jacob Kurtzberg), whose style owed a little to Cubism and a lot to the tenements of his native Lower East Side.\nOccasionally a kid from somewhere out there would take a bus to New York and start writing and drawing. So Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegel befriended each other at a Cleveland high school and created Superman, the first and most powerful of the superheroes.\n\u201cIf you are Jewish, you\u2019re not going to get work at The New Yorker magazine of that time, you\u2019re not going to get a job at a big ad firm,\u201d said Debra Schmidt Bach, who organized this show with Nina Nazionale.\nIt\u2019s not difficult to divine the attraction of superheroes. America was struggling out of the Depression. The clouds of fascism, anti-Semitism and war hung low across Europe.\nWhat New York kid wouldn\u2019t scan the sky for a Superman?\nThese heroes and their alter egos were, like most of us, a bit singed. Batman was a bloodied orphan and a loner. Daredevil was blind. Peter Parker was a brainiac nebbish living with his aunt and uncle when a radioactive spider bit him. I would run my hand along the cobwebbed windowsill of our fifth-floor rent-controlled apartment and think: \u201cA single bite and I\u2019m climbing that wall and swinging from water towers \u2026 .\u201d\nSubtext abounded. The historical society features a strip by the cartoonist Jules Feiffer in which a neurotic Superman talks of saving a woman who \u201ctook one look at my cape and said I was a latent transvestite, and why was my costume so skintight and did I rescue more men than women?\u201d\nMr. Siegel created Superman a year after his father died during a robbery in Cleveland. Scholars have argued that the Superman myth is the story of Moses, with the baby Kal-El arriving in a rocket ship rather than an ark of bulrushes. They have suggested that the name Kal-El has roots in Hebrew.\nMy friends and I roamed the city in search of dusty shops with piles of old comics filled with such mysteries. We found a favorite haunt on Amsterdam Avenue, an unnamed, often padlocked storefront known as \u201cthe old lady\u2019s place.\u201d To get there we had to walk by the teenage boys at Joan of Arc Middle School, who shook us down for quarters.\nWhere was Batman when you needed him?\nStill later we found the Memory Shop on Fourth Avenue in the East Village. I bought Justice League of America No. 1 for $7. (Note to burglars: Yes, I still have it, but it\u2019s in pretty crummy condition.)\nLong ago, during nocturnal city wanderings, my friend Paul Spillenger and I imagined a time-altering superhero. Alas, beer and joints left us with shards of memory the next morning.\nMy comic book days are long gone, although boxes with plastic-wrapped comics sit somewhere in my basement. Maybe our pasteurized city has less need of superheroes, although one who could roll back insane rents or bring an arrogant hedge funder to his knees might be welcomed. (The writer Ta-Nehisi Coates has signed on to reimagine Black Panther, an African superhero who spends, of course, much time in New York City.)\nMore likely, a Bangladeshi kid in Elmhurst and a Senegalese kid in University Heights are doodling in their seventh-grade math classes, and they have their own ideas. You may hear about them in the New-York Historical Society\u2019s next superhero show, in 2060.",

    "text": "Why Giving Back Isn\u2019t Enough\n2015-12-17T15:02:34.000Z\nDURING this season of giving, I will join millions of Americans in volunteering to feed the homeless, contributing to clothing drives and donating to poverty-fighting charities. Yet I worry that through these acts of kindness, I absolve myself of asking deeper questions about injustice and inequality. We Americans are a remarkably bighearted people, but I believe the purpose of our philanthropy must not only be generosity, but justice.\nThe origins of formal philanthropy date from at least 1889, when the American industrialist Andrew Carnegie composed his \u201cGospel of Wealth.\u201d He drafted this intellectual charter at the peak of the Gilded Age, when inequality had reached extreme levels. Carnegie argued, as many still do, that inequality on this scale is an unavoidable condition of the free-market system \u2014 and that it was even desirable, if the promise of wealth incentivized hard work. Philanthropy, he believed, would ease the pressure of rising social anxiety that followed from inequality \u2014 ameliorating the afflictions of the market without altering the market system itself.\nDuring the 20th century, an entire field of institutional philanthropy emerged and flourished in the pattern of Carnegie\u2019s mold. Iconic American families \u2014 Gates, Knight, MacArthur, Mellon, Rockefeller \u2014 endowed and expanded foundations that built schools and libraries, developed new vaccines, revolutionized agriculture and advanced human freedom. My own organization, the Ford Foundation, has given billions to support everything from public television in the United States to microlending in Bangladesh.\nOur work has been indisputably for the good: Millions of people around the world have access to new tools and resources with which to improve their lives. A few months ago, the World Bank estimated that, for the first time in history, fewer than one in 10 human beings lives in extreme poverty. This is progress.\nAnd yet, for all the advances made in the last century, society\u2019s challenges may have outpaced philanthropy\u2019s resources. Today, the cumulative wealth of the most generous donors seems a pittance compared with the world\u2019s trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of need. Generosity, blooming as it may be from legacies of both Carnegie\u2019s age and the newly enriched, is no longer enough.\nThe world may need a reimagined charter of philanthropy \u2014 a \u201cGospel of Wealth\u201d for the 21st century \u2014 that serves not just American philanthropists, but the vast array of new donors emerging around the world.\nThis new gospel might begin where the previous one fell short: addressing the underlying causes that perpetuate human suffering. In other words, philanthropy can no longer grapple simply with what is happening in the world, but also with how and why.\nFeeding the hungry is among our society\u2019s most fundamental obligations, but we should also question why our neighbors are without nutritious food to eat. Housing the homeless is an imperative, but we should also question why our housing markets are so distorted. As a nation, we need more investment in education, but not without questioning educational disparities based on race, class and geography.\nOur self-awareness \u2014 our humility \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be limited to examining the problems. It should include the structures of solutions, like giving itself. As the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said not long before his assassination, \u201cPhilanthropy is commendable, but it must not cause the philanthropist to overlook the circumstances of economic injustice which make philanthropy necessary.\u201d It is, after all, an offspring of the free market; it is enabled by returns on capital.\nAnd yet, too often, we have declined to question our own circumstances: a system that produces vast differences in privilege, and then tasks the most privileged with improving the system.\nWhatever our intentions, the truth is that we can inadvertently widen inequality in the course of making money, even though we claim to support equality and justice when giving it away. And while our end-of-year giving might support worthy organizations, we must also ask if these financial donations contribute to larger social change.\nIn other words, \u201cgiving back\u201d is necessary, but not sufficient. We should seek to bring about lasting, systemic change, even if that change might adversely affect us. We must bend each act of generosity toward justice.\nWe, as foundations and individuals, should fund people, their ideas and organizations that are capable of addressing deep-rooted injustice. We should ensure that the voices of those most affected by injustice \u2014 women, racial minorities, the poor, religious and ethnic minorities and L.G.B.T. individuals \u2014 help decide where and what philanthropy puts money behind, not in simply receiving whatever philanthropy decides to give them.\nWe can wield data and technology, see through a diversity of viewpoints, and draw upon a century of philanthropy\u2019s success and failure to identify and address the barriers holding people back.\nThis modern giving charter should look different in different settings. At the Ford Foundation, our efforts will focus on inequality: not just wealth disparities, but injustices in politics, culture and society that compound inequality and limit opportunity. We will ask questions like, are we hearing \u2014 and heeding \u2014 those who understand the problems best? What can we do to leverage our privilege to disrupt the drivers of inequality?\nOthers in philanthropy will take different, but no less effective, approaches. Many already are answering King\u2019s call, working intensely toward a world that renders philanthropy unnecessary. Ultimately, we each must do our part to ensure that giving not only makes us feel better, but also makes our society more just.",

    "text": "Amid Perilous Mediterranean Crossings, Migrants Find a Relatively Easy Path to Greece\n2015-08-16T10:00:04.000Z\nBODRUM, Turkey \u2014 As darkness falls and the last of the shorefront cafes in Bodrum clear their tables for the night, dozens of migrants pour out of a waiting bus. In the gloam, they charge for the sea, dragging a large rubber dinghy.\nTheir smugglers point them toward the flashing lighthouse on the Greek island of Kos, as little as 25 minutes away in a good boat.\nIn their flimsy inflatables, they usually reach there by dawn, quickly puncture their dinghies so no one can force them back, then walk into town.\nViewed from either side, the passage, while risky, is remarkably organized and unfettered. Compared with other routes for migrants crossing the Mediterranean, where more than 2,000 people have died this year, it is a relatively first-class ride. So easy and efficient is it, in fact, that in July the route was used by more than 7,000 refugees \u2014 most fleeing wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. At least 2,000 crossed this past week alone.\nThe human tide has overwhelmed the island of Kos, leading its mayor, George Kiritsis, to predict that if he does not get help from Athens, \u201cblood will be shed.\u201d And it has left Greece \u2014 for now, foremost in Europe \u2014 struggling to balance how to humanely accommodate the refugees against the risk of encouraging still more.\nAlready, for those who have made the journey, seeking safety, opportunity and a new life, the welcome has been less than hoped for.\n\u201cIn Istanbul, they let us use the toilets for free,\u201d said Ayman Almotlak, 31, a Syrian who teaches Arabic and made the crossing to Kos, speaking of the local merchants. \u201cHere not. Why do the Greeks hate us?\u201d\nHis traveling companion, a veterinarian, Nour Hamad, 31, was similarly disillusioned. \u201cThey throw bottles at us, sometimes glasses,\u201d he said.\nPart of the reason is the sheer magnitude of the wave of migrants and refugees, which the Greek government has said is too much for such a crisis-ridden country \u2014 let alone an island like Kos \u2014 to handle.\nDoctors Without Borders complained that the Greek authorities were \u201cabusing\u201d the refugees by, at one point last week, forcing them into a stadium where they remained without proper hygiene, food or water.\nThe International Organization for Migration, based in Geneva, said Friday that nearly 250,000 migrants had crossed the Mediterranean to Europe this year, already more than for all of 2014. Greece alone, it said, had reported 134,988 arrivals from Turkey this year.\nSingling out the strain on Greece, the United Nations has called for urgent action to address the crisis in Europe.\nFor many of the refugees, Greece is seen as a steppingstone to Western Europe. Although Turkey is hosting nearly two million Syrian refugees, more than any other country, many Syrians say that they do not see a future there.\nTo get to Europe, they depend on a vast illegal migrant smuggling operation that has grown over the past year as the Syrian civil war grinds on.\n\u201cA year ago people were still hopeful that the war might end, but now, with no end in sight, people want to leave and build a new life,\u201d said Bashar, 32, a Syrian refugee in Bodrum, who did not want to give his last name. He had spent the past year in Turkey getting surgery after he was wounded by a barrel bomb.\nIn Bodrum, smugglers charge between $1,000 to $1,500 per person to transfer the migrants to Kos. The price includes the rubber boat and training some of the passengers on how to steer it.\nLife jackets are not included and are discouraged by some smugglers, who argue that they take up too much space.\nOn a recent night in Bodrum after two of the boats took off, life jackets, socks and backpacks were scattered across the beach.\n\u201cThe smugglers are cruel \u2014 they don\u2019t treat the refugees like humans,\u201d said Senol Bayrak, a local fisherman who observes the activity in the area. \u201cFor them every meter of that boat is a dollar and it counts.\u201d\nTurkish authorities have been accused of turning a blind eye to the crisis unfolding along the country\u2019s southern shores, and allowing the refugees to pass through, something that has generated increasing tensions with their Greek counterparts.\nResidents say that hundreds of boats leave throughout the night, and are intercepted only once citizens alert the authorities.\nOn Thursday night, residents watched as one of the boats left the shore and drifted in the direction opposite to Kos. Once the boat was out of sight, distressed shouts could be heard in the distance, prompting the residents to call the Coast Guard, who later intercepted the boat.\n\u201cThey come when we call them, but they need to do more,\u201d said Erol, 69, a retired captain, who would give only his first name.\nBut the local military police insist that they are doing everything in their power to prevent the refugees from leaving via illegal and dangerous routes.\nThey say that they carry out extensive daily patrols, but that the vast numbers of migrants trying to leave at once is \u201cunmanageable.\u201d\n\u201cWe are in close coordination with the coast guards, who are working hand in hand with Greece to save lives,\u201d a senior Turkish military police chief said on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the matter.\n\u201cThe greatest obstacle is proving that they are planning to leave and catching out the smugglers who hide within their opaque network,\u201d he said as he looked out at the garden of the police station, where detained migrants lay listlessly under the trees.\nA total of 1,799 illegal migrants trying to get to Greece were picked up on the Aegean in 44 separate operations from Aug. 7 to Aug. 10, while two human traffickers were also detained, the Turkish Coast Guard Command said.\nAmong the refugees, the Syrians, who tend to be more middle class, come the most well-equipped. They almost always have cellphones and GPS, and they have memorized every step they must take as they head out of Greece and toward their destination, greater Europe.\n\u201cI have a map,\u201d said Mr. Almotlak, the Syrian teacher, tapping his head. \u201cIt is here \u2014 and on Google Maps.\u201d\nOnce in Greece, the smugglers organize trips for the migrants, give them tips and connect them with buses, trains and taxis, all for a prearranged fee, while merchants sell them gear, such as tents.\nPack your 500-euro notes in zip-lock bags and carry them in your underwear, they are told. Download WhatsApp, so you can send instant messages.\nThe profiteering is both large and small. The passage from Bodrum to Kos might cost about $1,500, but once in Kos, Greek merchants also make money by selling equipment or charging as much as 4 euros, about $4.40, the price of a cappuccino, just to use the bathroom.\nWhile many Greeks have extended their hospitality, providing food and water to the migrants, others resent their presence in the midst of the tourist season.\nThe tension has eased over the past few days, as the Greek government heeded the mayor\u2019s request to send reinforcements and relief to Kos, where refugees are camped out.\nAthens has sped up the evacuation of the refugees by sending a dozen more people to process their papers, adding to the four or five who had been doing it. That has allowed more than 1,000 people a day to leave the island on ferryboats for Piraeus, the port of Athens.\nYet the Syrians are a privileged class among the migrants. At home, Syrians have suffered during the lengthy civil war. But on Kos, being a Syrian is a badge of honor and, many of the refugees from elsewhere believe, a ticket to Europe.\nAuthorities say that among the migrants, there are hundreds \u2014 from places like Iraq, Iran or Afghanistan \u2014 who are posing as Syrians.\nIn Kos, Syrians have been given priority for lodgings in a huge ferryboat that docked at the island on Friday, intended to be used as a dormitory ship for migrants camped on the promenade and in public plazas.\nAt the opposite extreme from the Syrians are about 500 migrants from countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh who have been squatting in an abandoned hotel outside town, squeezed into about 60 rooms, with running water but no electricity.\nBecause the Syrians are from a war-torn country, the Greeks give them papers allowing them to stay in the country for longer than others.\nMost do not want to stay in Greece, but this gives them time to make the trip north.\nWhen they cross the border, they are in limbo again, and can be sent back, they say. So they avoid places like Western Union, where the police may lurk.\nInstead, many carry cash or pick it up from middlemen along the way. Their goal is to make it to a country like Germany or Sweden and request asylum, then bring their families.\nMr. Almotlak calculated two possible routes: to Britain or to Germany. He settled on Germany, even though he preferred England, because of the cost.\nHe could travel from Syria to Germany for \u20ac3,000 to \u20ac4,000, he said, but England could take \u20ac10,000 or \u20ac12,000.\nOn Saturday morning, Mosaab Alhamed, 32, a Syrian who has a law degree and owned a grocery store with his father and brother, and 41 others, including nine women and two children, made their second attempt to reach Kos.\nTheir overloaded boat puttered along for three hours, the Kos harbor lights shimmering like a mirage in the distance. Within a kilometer of Kos, a Greek police boat approached the boat and an officer cried out \u201cStop! Stop!\u201d in English, Mr. Alhamed said a few hours later. When the refugees kept going, the officer fired a warning shot into the air, making Mr. Alhamed\u2019s heart pound. This time the boat stopped and the police towed it to shore, then let the passengers go.\nThat night, Mr. Alhamed and two friends shared a \u20ac50 hotel room, showered and rested. At a souvlaki restaurant, they debated whether to go to Athens next or straight to Thessaloniki, before continuing, probably to Germany.\nHe had not been traumatized by his trip, Mr. Alhamed said, his blue eyes crinkling in a warm smile. The war in Syria was much worse. His family grocery had been bombed and destroyed, his home occupied by the regime and his three dogs killed. He wondered what had happened to his cat.\nAs he spoke, Mr. Alhamed tossed scrap after scrap of his uneaten chicken schnitzel to cats in the restaurant. \u201cI love cats,\u201d he said, wistfully.",

    "text": "Doing Exactly What You Dreamed About\n2015-11-22T10:42:21.000Z\nMarie France Van Damme  is the founder of the luxury resortwear company that bears her name. She is based in Hong Kong.\nQ. Did you come from a family of entrepreneurs?\nA. Not at all. My father is an academic \u2014 he was a mathematician \u2014 and my two little brothers each have a Ph.D. Attending school was always very important in my family, and not just for one degree but many degrees. If it had been up to my father, I would have started with an M.B.A., then gone to law school. So when I told him one day I wasn\u2019t going to pursue my studies, well, it didn\u2019t go down too well. I\u2019d interned as a summer job for a fashion house in Montreal, and I\u2019d really enjoyed it, so I decided I wasn\u2019t going to finish my degree and I was going to join that fashion house full time. It was a very small company and I got a chance to do everything, and that\u2019s what I enjoyed about it. I really think that\u2019s the best school to learn in, and even today we\u2019re a small company, and when new people join I do expect them to multitask.\nQ. How old were you when you started managing others?\nA. I was working with Fenn Wright Manson, a fashion company. I was very involved with the manufacturing of the products, regularly going to Hong Kong, where the clothes were being produced, and one day one of their manufacturers told me he wanted to open an office in New York to enlarge its customer base. So at the age of 21, I became his partner. He gave me a huge percentage of the business, which was quite generous, and I basically had $100,000 in the bank account, which was not a small sum in the early \u201980s. I had to set up an office in New York City, hire a few people right away and make it work.\nQ. What were the early difficulties?\nA. I would go to department stores and offer to design a collection under their label and it would be manufactured in Hong Kong. Some already did \u201cprivate label,\u201d but very basic, and I would offer them more premium products. In those days it was still very new for many, although Macy\u2019s already had something. There was a lot of skepticism. It was something so new, and the fact that I was so young and a girl was not helping.\nI also had to learn some tough realities quickly. I still remember the first time I got an invoice from a contractor who had come on a Sunday when we were closed and still billed me for the trip. The lawyer told me you can fight, but it will cost you more. New York can be very tough, very competitive. But my toughest experience was when I had to fire someone I had become very close friends with; to this day it still bothers me, but I didn\u2019t have a choice. That\u2019s when I realized you have to be careful and you can\u2019t mix business and friendship.\nQ. Today you are mixing business and family, as your three sons are working with you. How are you managing?\nA. When I started my current business three years ago, I told all of them, \u201cIf you want to work with me, this is the opportunity. Choose now what you would like to do, as we\u2019re starting from zero.\u201d So my oldest son wanted to be on the creative side, the P.R., the communication, and casting of the models [laughs]. The middle one, who was a golf pro in Thailand, said he would look after our stores there if we opened there, which we did. My youngest was coming from a financial background and decided to work on the systems and sales. He\u2019s the one who is with me nonstop; I guess I could almost say he\u2019s my boss now [laughs].\nI\u2019m careful. We don\u2019t bring the business home because I don\u2019t want it to be too much for them. The good thing is that when we have disagreements, it goes on for five minutes and then we get over it.\nQ. You moved to Hong Kong in 1984. What do you remember of your early years working there?\nA. It happened progressively. I started a trading business, working with the buyers and giving orders to the factories. One of my customers was La Redoute [the French catalog sales company], and their orders could be huge or could also be very small, and it was very difficult to manage with the factories. That\u2019s when I told my husband, we need to get into the manufacturing business, which was a whole new ballgame. We opened a small factory in Hong Kong.\nSomeone told me I should really check out China, because I could produce for half the cost than in Hong Kong. It seemed too complicated, so at first I let it go. But as all the manufacturers in Hong Kong were closing down and moving to China, I didn\u2019t really have a choice in the end. Maybe I got very lucky but I found the right person from the start, someone I could really trust.\nI know a lot of people have bad stories to tell. I think the main issue was that many mainland Chinese thought about the now, not the tomorrow, and if there was money to be made now, that\u2019s all that mattered. My Chinese partner was different. We built a nice business, and at one point I had 1,500 people on the factory floor, with clients like Cama\u00efeu, Auchan, Promod, Marks & Spencer. But then the business changed.\nFirst, costs started to go up, everything started to be about saving pennies, and for five cents the buyer would go to Bangladesh to put their order. And for all their requests about having minimum workplace compliance issues in China, clients didn\u2019t want to hear about cost going up.\nOne day I woke up and I decided to close down everything. I just wasn\u2019t enjoying work anymore. I just wanted to work without having to look at cost anymore, use the most beautiful fabrics and do exactly what I had always been dreaming about doing and go the other extreme way.\nQ. Tell me about the early days of your current company. \nA. I designed my first little niche collection and asked a friend who worked at Bulgari whether she knew anybody in Harrods. She got me an appointment the next day with the head of merchandising.\nI actually really was not ready \u2014 in fact, I was a bit embarrassed going through their floor; they had everything and it all looked too fabulous. I went in, and she just loved the collection, called in the buyer and an hour later I had my first order. I got out of the meeting and told my son who was at university, \u201cWhat do I do now? She needs to see the clothes on a model.\u201d And he said, \u201cGet undressed!\u201d So I modeled them.\nQ. As you moved from manufacturing for others to creating your own brand, what have been the challenges?\nA. The world of luxury is certainly very different. There is so much already out there. I think you have to be different, find a gap. In my case, I felt there wasn\u2019t enough choice for resort clothes, and what I found to go to the beach was very colorful and could only be worn there. I\u2019m more of a black and white person; that\u2019s what my designs are about. It\u2019s also about versatility, because when you sell something at $500 to go to the beach, at that price point you want to be able to wear it again, and not just at the beach but back to the city.\nQ. What would you tell your younger self?\nA. You need to be very disciplined. If you\u2019re going to work for yourself, you\u2019ll need to put in the hours. There will be sacrifices, but it\u2019s very rewarding, too.",

    "text": "Midwood, Brooklyn, Where Urban and Suburban Meet\n2015-09-16T08:57:39.000Z\nThe tree-lined streets of Midwood, with many single- and multifamily houses at prices that are relatively inexpensive for Brooklyn, naturally attract plenty of families. In fact, the basketball hoops dotting the driveways, and the Cozy Coupes and tricycles scattered along the sidewalks, might make visitors wonder if they were still in New York City.\n\u201cMidwood is a crazy combination of urban and suburban,\u201d said Menachem Trietel, an agent at Weichert Realtors. Or as Alvin M. Berk, the chairman of Brooklyn Community Board 14, which includes parts of Midwood, put it: \u201cMidwood is quiet and that\u2019s how we like it.\u201d\nThat atmosphere is what attracted Murray Lantner, 46, and his wife, Moran, to the neighborhood about five years ago. Expecting their first child and living with Mr. Lantner\u2019s parents in Mill Basin, Brooklyn, the couple longed for a place of their own. Ms. Lantner had moved to New York from Israel some years before, and the couple were looking for a neighborhood that felt like a strong community and was within commuting distance of Mr. Lantner\u2019s downtown Manhattan office.\nThey bought a two-bedroom co-op on Avenue I and East 17th Street for $290,000 and have since had two more children. \u201cWe\u2019re walking distance to our synagogue, and we spend a lot of time there, because there\u2019s a gym and a pool and we take the kids,\u201d Mr. Lantner said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real neighborhood. We ride our bikes, it\u2019s very safe.\u201d\nMidwood has long been known as a Jewish neighborhood. Orthodox families began moving there about 30 years ago, attracted by the housing at prices that were lower than in nearby Orthodox areas like Borough Park.\nBut the neighborhood also has a mix of recently arrived immigrants \u2014 Chinese, Turkish, Pakistani, Polish, Russian and Bangladeshi \u2014 as well as lifelong New Yorkers.\nDaniel G. Shapiro, an associate broker at Ditmas Estates, who has sold many homes in Midwood, said, \u201cYou\u2019re starting to see singles, married people without kids, gay couples and hipsters from Park Slope and Manhattan.\u201d\nIn that regard, Bernard Taylor and his husband, Jeffrey Taylor, both 55, were Midwood pioneers. They moved there about 15 years ago from Park Slope, looking for more space at a reasonable price. Midwood is also within walking distance of Brooklyn College, where Jeffrey Taylor is a professor. Bernard Taylor, a sixth-grade English teacher, drives to his job in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. The couple rented at first, then bought a one-bedroom co-op on East 17th street.\nTwo years ago they bought a large two-bedroom in the same building for $265,000 and undertook a major renovation. \u201cBy then we knew we didn\u2019t want to leave the neighborhood,\u201d Bernard Taylor said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a lot to do here \u2014 in fact, most people we meet still don\u2019t know where Midwood is \u2014 but we love the space and the peace.\u201d\nLinda S. Goodman, the executive director of the Midwood Development Corporation, a community group, said: \u201cWhat I love about Midwood is I walk out of my door and I see all kinds of people walking side by side. That\u2019s better than the suburbs.\u201d\nWhat You\u2019ll Find\nMidwood, by one popular definition, is bounded roughly by East 12th Street to the west; Flatbush Avenue to the east; the railroad tracks between Avenue H and Avenue I to the north; and Kings Highway to the south. It is dominated by single- and multifamily homes, both detached and attached, and mostly built around the 1920s. There are also plenty of prewar co-op and condo buildings, a good handful of them being renovated to appeal to buyers from other parts of the city.\nMidwood\u2019s lettered avenues have many shopping and food options. Kings Highway, filled with shops, cafes and restaurants, now has a Starbucks and a Chipotle.\nWhat You\u2019ll Pay\nAs in much of Brooklyn, inventory has been tight. Listings tend to sell quickly, said Charles D\u2019Alessandro, an associate broker with Fillmore Real Estate who recently sold three single-family homes in the area.\nAs of Sept. 14, there were 51 homes and apartments for sale, ranging from a one-bedroom, one-bath co-op for $164,999 to a seven-bedroom five-bath single-family home for $2.95 million, according to StreetEasy.com.\nThe median sales price for homes from Jan. 1 to July 31 this year was $794,000, compared with $710,000 for the same period in 2014, an 11.8 percent jump.\nCondos and co-ops, however, remained stable or decreased. The median sales price for co-ops through July 31 this year was $198,500, down 5.5 percent from $210,000 for the same period in 2014. Condos had a median price of $537,636, compared with $540,000 the year before.\nRental buildings are few and far between. Most rentals are in multifamily homes. And rents are rising. \u201cA decent two-bedroom rental will go for $2,500, up from about $2,000 last year,\u201d said Mr. Shapiro of Ditmas Estates.\nWhat to Do\nOn Avenues M and J you\u2019ll find Jewish bakeries, bagel shops, food stores and kosher restaurants, along with shops reflecting a variety of cultures. Weekends are quiet along these stretches, as many shops are closed Friday evenings and Saturdays for the Sabbath. Social life and other activities for many residents revolve around the synagogue.\nDi Fara Pizza on Avenue J may be known for its long lines as much as for its individually made-to-order pies. The owners are opening Di Fara Dolce, a cafe selling Italian desserts, around the corner on East 15th Street on Sept. 22, when the pizzeria celebrates its 50th anniversary.\nKolbert Park, on Avenue L between 17th and 18th Streets, is one of Midwood\u2019s few parks. Here, nannies and young mothers watch children on the playgrounds while men play chess and other games on tables nearby and teenagers play handball and basketball.\nBrooklyn Center for the Performing Arts, at Brooklyn College, which is in Flatbush, to the north of the neighborhood, kicks off its season on Oct. 24 with a Sinatra tribute concert by Michael Feinstein.\nThe Schools\nYeshivas dominate the school scene in Midwood, and the streets are often full of yellow buses ferrying Orthodox children.\nMost public schools in Midwood are part of sprawling District 22. P.S. 193, the Gil Hodges School, at 2515 Avenue L, in the center of the neighborhood, serves prekindergarten through Grade 5. According to the 2013-2104 Elementary School Quality Snapshot, 39 percent of students met standards in English, compared with 30 percent citywide, and 37 percent met standards in math, compared with 39 percent citywide.\nAndries Hudde School, a public junior high on Nostrand Avenue, serves Grades 6 through 8. During the 2013-2014 school year, 24 percent of students met standards in English, compared with 27 percent citywide, and 24 percent met standards in math, compared with 29 percent citywide.\nEdward R. Murrow High School, on Avenue L, has several audition-only arts programs. In 2014, students scored averages of 460 in critical reading, 485 in math and 452 in writing on their SATs, compared with the citywide averages of 441, 463 and 436.\nThe Commute\nMidwood is served by the B and Q subway lines. The ride into Midtown Manhattan takes about 45 minutes. The 2 and 5 trains stop at the Flatbush Avenue-Brooklyn College station near the northeast corner of the neighborhood. The area is served by local buses and express buses into Manhattan, the BM1, BM3 and BM4. The fare for express buses is $6.50.\nThe History\nMidwood is derived from the Dutch word \u201cMidwout,\u201d meaning middle woods. The Dutch colonized the area in 1652 and later gave way to the English. Midwood has a lustrous past in film and early television thanks to the Vitagraph Studios that were built here at the turn of the last century. The space that housed them, later a girls\u2019 school, was recently gutted, despite a preservation effort.",

    "text": "Falcon Hunters Become Fervent Preservationists \n2015-01-05T01:13:15.000Z\nPANGTI, India \u2014 Driving the last 20 miles of road to this tiny village takes at least two hours and a fondness for heights, so it seems unlikely that this area of jungle near the Myanmar border will ever become a popular destination for birders.\nBut those who do brave the road \u2014 ignoring State Department travel advisories about \u201csporadic incidents of violence by ethnic insurgent groups\u201d that recently resulted in at least 75 deaths in neighboring Assam State \u2014 will get to witness one of the most extraordinary migrations of a raptor species in the world.\nJust two years ago, residents slaughtered hundreds of thousands of the birds \u2014 Amur falcons \u2014 and sold them to local markets here in Nagaland and in Assam, states in the crooked finger of Indian land that loops over Bangladesh beside China and Myanmar. But this October and November, millions of the falcons passed largely unmolested through India on their way from Russia to their wintering grounds in southern Africa.\nThe reversal was the result of a concerted campaign by a few conservationists whose video of the killings produced worldwide revulsion and embarrassed state and local officials into action. But villagers here have since become surprisingly enthusiastic stewards of the birds they once slaughtered for food.\n\u201cWe saw the birds as God\u2019s blessing, like manna from heaven, and we hunted them more and more and depended on them more and more,\u201d said R. Obemomo Jami, Pangti\u2019s village manager, who like many Nagas is fervently Christian. \u201cThen the world came to know that the Pangti village people have created a great sin. And so the village passed a ban.\u201d\nIn the wake of the hunting ban, many in the village have struggled. Two private schools that depended largely on money generated by falcon hunting are suffering as families strain to meet tuition payments, officials and hunters said in separate interviews.\nSo people here are hoping desperately \u2014 and probably vainly \u2014 to attract cavalcades of tourists. Some villagers fixed up their homes and even installed new toilets for the hoped-for clientele, and conservationists helped construct several birding platforms.\nSo far, though, tourists have yet to discover this stunningly beautiful landscape, where the sounds of Christian hymns at several robust congregations drift over the village\u2019s tin roofs every evening.\n\u201cStill, we will not go back to hunting,\u201d said Zanthungo Shitiri, president of the local fishermen\u2019s union, whose members did much of the hunting. \u201cI have not gone even once to hunt.\u201d\nAmur falcons are small birds of prey that feed mostly on insects. They breed in the spring in Siberia and eastern China and then, aided by strong westerly winds, migrate in hordes in October and early November through India to South Africa.\nA recent effort to affix satellite trackers on seven falcons found that Amurs fly nonstop up to 2,000 miles for two to three days at a stretch when passing over the Arabian Sea. This feat may be possible because of a countermigration of dragonflies, which the birds eat. They also feed on termites, locusts, ants and beetles, but will occasionally dine on small birds and frogs.\nFalcons have been coming to Nagaland for as long as anyone can remember, but a dam across the Doyang River created a reservoir in 1999 that seemed to attract millions more to Pangti. The Nagas, a tribal people proud of their hunting heritage, shot the birds indiscriminately, but soon realized that fishing nets spread over trees could capture thousands at a time as the birds flocked in the evenings to roost.\nHunters said that in five weeks of work they could earn almost $500, or nearly half the average annual income in India. Local officials estimated that villagers killed 100,000 to 400,000 birds annually, and men carrying bamboo poles sagging with scores of dead birds became a common sight.\nPangti is so remote that conservationists heard nothing but vague rumors about vast killings. A slow-burning insurgency and a cumbersome government permit process for visitors discouraged travel, although violence has declined significantly and travel permits are no longer needed.\n\u201cNagaland was closed for decades, so it\u2019s mostly unexplored territory for Indian naturalists and bird watchers,\u201d said Ramki Sreenivasan, a co-founder of Conservation India.\nBano Haralu, an amateur ornithologist, joined Mr. Sreenivasan and two others in finally visiting Pangti in October 2012.\n\u201cThe closer we got to the village, the more dead birds we saw,\u201d Ms. Haralu said. \u201cIt was awful.\u201d\nLess than a year earlier, India had participated in an international conference on protecting migratory species, so the pictures of mass slaughter that the conservationists published online were deeply embarrassing.\nState wildlife officials, who had been in Pangti for nearly two years because of troubles with wild elephants, suddenly promised a crackdown on the killing. Under pressure, the Pangti Village Council banned the hunt.\nPerhaps the most successful effort has been an educational program in schools that teaches children about the life cycle of Amur falcons and why they should be protected.\n\u201cWe do nature walks with the kids, and we also do classroom teaching about the falcons,\u201d said Yibeni K. Tanthan, a teacher in the neighboring village of Sungro.\nThe brightest posters in the schools are now those advocating falcon preservation, gifts from conservationists. The children sing a song about the falcons that urges: \u201cDon\u2019t chase them, don\u2019t let them fly away from us.\u201d\nMr. Shitiri of the fishermen\u2019s union said the children\u2019s embrace of the birds has been crucial.\n\u201cSo many of the children decided very fast for preservation,\u201d Mr. Shitiri said. \u201cSo that is the main reason we are in for total preservation.\u201d\nNow that Pangti has stopped killing the birds, reports have emerged that roosting sites elsewhere in northeast India are being targeted. Officials have promised to trace the reports and stop other killings.\nMr. Sreenivasan said the birds, while not endangered because of their vast numbers, may play a crucial ecological role.\n\u201cAre they controlling the insect population in three continents? We don\u2019t know, but I think we\u2019ll eventually find out that the Amur falcon\u2019s doing something extremely significant,\u201d Mr. Sreenivasan said. \u201cWhy else would they fly halfway around the world?\u201d",

    "text": "How Los Angeles Is Becoming a \u2018Third World\u2019 City\n2015-07-06T07:21:21.000Z\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 A GENERATION ago, this West Coast metropolis became a \u201cthird world city.\u201d At least in the rhetoric of certain East Coast thinkers.\nA 1991 book by David Rieff cited visitors who were stunned by \u201cseeing nothing but brown faces, hearing nothing but Spanish on the streets.\u201d The arrival of coffee-colored Latino masses (like me and my Guatemalan-American family), together with the spread of Mandarin and Korean logograms on street signs, led Mr. Rieff to call this the \u201ccapital of the third world.\u201d\nAs a native of the city, I was offended to hear it tagged with such a denigrating label. But in recent years, and for different reasons, I\u2019ve come to believe that a metropolis of the \u201cdeveloping world,\u201d to use a more polite expression, is being born here.\nIts center is not in East Los Angeles, or any other Latino neighborhood; nor in our recently christened \u201cLittle Bangladesh.\u201d The third world exists everywhere here \u2014 in the spread of inequality.\nThe deepening gap between rich and poor is both a sociological fact and a state of mind. The cost of housing is up dramatically, and so is homelessness.\n\u201cIf it feels like there are people living on the streets and under bridges everywhere you look, it\u2019s because there are,\u201d Bianca Barragan wrote for the website L.A. Curbed last month, after a survey by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority found an 85 percent increase in the number of people living in tents and cars over the past two years. In all, the census counted more than 25,000 homeless people in the city, up 12 percent over the same period.\nIn my hillside neighborhood in northeast Los Angeles, the value of a two-bedroom home has climbed to $750,000 or more. Buy in, and you could get a nice view of a valley with sycamore trees and a homeless camp. On social media, I hear my neighbors demanding that city officials intensify indigent-removal efforts.\n\u201cThe problem is not gone,\u201d wrote a resident on a neighborhood website in May, after city officials cleared out scores of homeless people. \u201cSaw 6 people or more on the hillside. Tents and cooking! Looks like more work needs to be done.\u201d\nCalifornia has both the most \u201cultrarich\u201d (people worth more than $30 million) and the worst poverty rate in America. Even though San Francisco recently overtook Los Angeles in ultrarich residents, ostentatious affluence and permanent poverty live side by side here.\n\u201cLook, Pap\u00e1,\u201d my 10-year-old daughter said as our old Subaru puttered past a local intersection that\u2019s been occupied for ages by homeless veterans. \u201cA Maserati!\u201d\nSilver, sleek, an apparition from the French Riviera, it glided past a lumbering city bus. A few days later, we saw a Tesla \u2014 the new status symbol of our eco-glitterati \u2014 driving along the Arroyo Seco Parkway, past the huts of wood, wire and blue tarpaulin that lined the roadway.\nThe paradox of increasing homelessness and rising prosperity has finally got Los Angeles talking about inequality. But the gap between rich and poor has been building here for 40 years. Every boom and bust simply accentuates the trend.\nBill Boyarsky, a retired city editor at The Los Angeles Times, dates the beginning to the decline of industrial Los Angeles in the 1970s: \u201cWe lost a huge number of middle-class jobs.\u201d At the same time, the tax revolt led by the businessman and politician Howard Jarvis cut funding for public education. \u201cWe ended up limiting the ability of kids to move ahead of their parents,\u201d said Mr. Boyarsky.\nLos Angeles still has a much larger middle class than your average developing-world city. But privilege and inequality are spreading in all sorts of public places.\nRich and poor have long suffered on the freeway together: Porsches and pickups alike, gridlocked. Now we have new toll roads; on some freeways, you can literally buy your way into the fast lane.\nDodger Stadium used to be one of the city\u2019s most democratic entertainment venues. In 1962, the most expensive seat was $5.50, about four times the price of a bleacher (or pavilion) seat. These days, field-level seats can cost up to $1,000, more than 30 times the price of a bleacher seat.\nThirty years ago, a family of four at poverty level lived on about $10,650 \u2014 about double the annual tuition at the city\u2019s top prep schools. The equivalent federal poverty line today, $24,250, would barely cover two-thirds of this year\u2019s tuition at schools like Harvard-Westlake or Polytechnic in Pasadena.\nIn the cities of the developing world, class differences this wide are fixed. Homelessness is a kind of caste, and the poorest city dwellers live in permanent squatter communities. In Buenos Aires, where I once lived, their homes are often built with discarded bricks and tiles.\nLos Angeles doesn\u2019t have neighborhoods like that yet, but homelessness has become semi-permanent in many places.\nA decade ago, a man created a shelter under a bridge across the street from my in-laws in South Pasadena; a series of homeless people has occupied it ever since \u2014 most recently, a white man of about 65 nicknamed the Cowboy. He told me he worked in aerospace until an accident left him with a brain injury.\nThe Cowboy (he declined to tell his real name) is proud of his home improvements: a modest retaining wall, a wood-chip floor. He\u2019s earned the trust of his property-owning neighbors. Once, he said, they passed around a petition to keep the police from kicking him out. As long as Los Angeles holds on to such compassion, it won\u2019t be a true \u201cthird world city.\u201d\nThe Cowboy asked me to visit again soon. \u201cLike a bad habit,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll keep coming back into your world.\u201d",

    "text": "This Earth Day, Green Is the New Denim\n2015-04-22T09:45:27.000Z\nEarth Day, April 22, means different things to different people: a chance to plant some seedlings; a call to activism; the time to actually make that New Year\u2019s resolution compost heap.\nBut to many fashion people, it mostly means an inbox clogged with emails trumpeting \u201cgreen is the new black,\u201d and celebrating \u201c100 percent vegan handbags, backpacks and clutches,\u201d or \u201c10 percent eco-friendly dyes and materials,\u201d or other such initiatives demonstrating the industry\u2019s environmental awareness and progress \u2014 as embodied by stuff you can buy.\nMeanwhile, Fashion Revolution Day, which takes place a mere two days later, means something else entirely: a day commemorating the human tragedy that was the 2013 Rana Plaza factory collapse by illuminating the continued lack of transparency in the supply chain. (Individuals are invited to wear their clothes inside out, tag the brand that made them and tweet #whomademyclothes.)\nFrom one day to the other, the messaging goes from one extreme to the other. Stuck between celebration and condemnation, what\u2019s a consumer to think?\nThe default reaction is, generally, suspicion, at least when it comes to the first. Certainly it is for me, and not just because it is part of my job to question motivation, or because it\u2019s also easier to criticize than praise (you look like less of a sucker), but because fashion has become notorious for its supply-chain abuses, from the blood diamond and Nike sweatshop scandals of the late 1990s to today\u2019s Bangladeshi tragedy.\nThen, too, fast fashion has created such a glut of inexpensive stuff that it\u2019s impossible to imagine it could end up a zero-sum game, even given such action as H & M\u2019s sustainability report.\nAnd yet a shift of sorts has taken place.\n\u201cOne line using one fiber for one thing doesn\u2019t change anything,\u201d Jason Kibbey, chief executive of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, said by phone from his base in California. \u201cBut there seems to be an understanding now that it\u2019s not about easy shopping choices.\u201d Mr. Kibbey\u2019s group is a trade organization whose members include everyone from Burberry to the Environmental Defense Fund.\nCall it Sustainable Fashion 2.0 (or, if you must, a \u201c \u2018sustainability journey\u2019 \u2014 terminology that drives me crazy,\u201d said Linda Greer, a senior scientist in the health program of the Natural Resources Defense Council).\nIt comes after stage one \u2014 acknowledging there is a problem and marketing the realization \u2014 and reflects brands\u2019 attempts to assess their own environmental impact, including water use, electricity, fiber production and so on, and \u201chold themselves accountable in a way they never have before,\u201d as Mr. Kibbey said.\nSee, for example, the environmental profit and loss statement  that Kering created in 2010 and applied to Puma and is currently applying to all its luxury brands, with results due in 2016, or pretty much any of the assessments demanded of the member brands in the proliferating sustainability indexes from names like Dow Jones, Ethisphere and Corporate Knights.\nOr see two developments that stood out this week because (like the above) they reflect a relatively new willingness on fashion\u2019s part to engage with the least mediagenic side of the issue. There\u2019s just no good way to reduce these initiatives to an Instagram moment.\nAnd in an industry based on image, one that has embraced that social media platform above all others (to such an extent that the Council of Fashion Designers of America is actually giving Instagram its \u201cmedia\u201d award this June), that\u2019s worth noting.\nFirst, Adidas, long a part of the above indexes, announced that it had signed a five-year \u201cseven figure\u201d contract to partner with an organization called Parley for the Oceans, which was created to publicize and tackle the problem of ocean plastic. It is the most long-term such initiative the company has signed to date, according to Eric Liedtke, head of global brands, and will involve both developing new plastic treatments that can be used in recycled polyester fabrics, and driving direct action. Translation: picking up plastic on the beach.\nAnd second, Maiyet, the socially conscious luxury brand started in 2010 to help create sustainable businesses in challenged regions of the world, embarked on its first supply-chain initiative, working with the Gobi Revival Fund to facilitate a vaccine program and \u201ccorral sanitation\u201d for nomadic goat herders in Mongolia as part of a drive to source ethical cashmere.\nEffectively, it is committing about $200,000 a year to the project, as well as buying 40 tons of fiber directly from the farmers (as opposed to from the traditional Chinese middlemen), which will then be spun into cashmere in a factory in Italy, with practices assessed by Maiyet. It plans to sell the material at the Florentine yarn fair, Pitti Filati, ensuring quality and supply for their own products as well as for any other brand that buys it. Also, presumably, some profit for themselves.\nStill, it\u2019s a more complicated narrative to sell than nice T-shirts. And though Adidas was introduced to Parley via its very camera-friendly supporter, and its collaborator, Pharrell Williams, garbage and goat waste tend not to quicken the heart the same way that, say, handbags and hot models do.\nSupply-chain issues are among the thorniest in all of fashion, both because of the human and environmental costs involved and because eyes tend to glaze over at the topic. But they are also, as Ms. Greer points out, the \u201cimpact hot spots of the industry.\u201d\nPointedly, the tension between the subject and its lack of eyeball appeal is partly why Cyrill Gutsch, the founder of Parley, wanted Adidas as a partner. \u201cThe creative community provides buzz,\u201d he said, \u201cand sneakers are signs of rebellion, and very close to the youth consumer.\u201d\nThe irony is, it\u2019s a reversal of the usual equation, in which fashion brands hook up with celebrities to give them buzz and appeal; the fashion part here gives the oompf to otherwise less than sexy subjects. As to what fashion gets (well, lip service to goodness aside), there is the bonus of managing reputational risk and increasing brand equity, which speaks directly to brand valuation.\nIn the meantime, a third development in yet another non-sexy area of fashion has received almost universal acclaim from environmental skeptics, a rare thing.\nTo be specific, the appointment of Burak Cakmak as the dean of the fashion school at Parsons The New School for Design. Chosen from among the approximately 200 applicants, according to Joel Towers, the executive dean of Parsons, Mr. Cakmak spent his career as the sustainability guy at companies like Kering, Swarovski and Gap.\n\u201cWe were looking for someone who could articulate the future of fashion and be a crossover figure, and Burak made the most compelling case,\u201d Mr. Towers said.\nTo wit: that sustainability had to be embedded into the curriculum of every class at Parsons, as opposed to being segregated into its own discipline. That understanding the environmental and human impact of design was soon going to be a requirement for all employees at fashion brands, be they creatives or corporate executives. That it was part of \u201cthe broader definition of intelligent design.\u201d\nIn other words, fashion may have reached the stage where it has realized green is no longer the new black: a trendy color that is in one year; out the next.\nNow it\u2019s the new denim: a basic every brand needs as part of doing business.",

    "text": "Thousands of Migrants Stranded in Greece as Route North Is Narrowed\n2015-12-09T21:07:11.000Z\nIDOMENI, Greece \u2014 There has been a rough triage taking place the last few weeks along the barbed-wire and chain-link fence separating Greece from Macedonia.\n\u201cOnly Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans!\u201d a Greek police officer shouted recently, looking over the bedraggled families coming forward at this transit camp, one of the main gateways for people fleeing conflict, persecution and poverty in search of better lives in Europe.\nThe rest \u2014 the Iranians, Yemenis, Ugandans, Moroccans, Algerians, Pakistanis, Congolese, Somalis and more \u2014 are left to look on with anger and despair.\nThe border crossing here ran smoothly for months, an efficient funnel for tens of thousands of people who had made it across the Aegean and the Mediterranean and were heading toward Germany and beyond. In orderly groups of 50, they were shepherded into Macedonia and onto trains heading north.\nBut the door to Europe, seemingly flung open this summer to all, has quietly shut for many of them, without much fanfare or explanation and over the objections of Greece. The idea is to slow the flow of people \u2014 nearly a million have reached Germany this year \u2014 and filter out some of those who would not qualify for refugee status on the basis of fleeing a war.\nSince the new policy took effect last month, thousands of migrants, unable to move forward and unwilling to go back, have been living in the fields around here, making do in ragged pup tents, their laundry drying nearby. They have huddled by campfires to stay warm, eagerly telling anyone who will listen that they, too, should be allowed to go north.\nAfter clashes between the police and the migrants, and amid concern that the encampment was blocking rail traffic across the border, the Greek authorities sent forces in on Wednesday to clear it out. They demanded that journalists and aid workers leave the scene, and they began herding hundreds of migrants onto buses that would take them to Athens, where they are to be housed while the government figures out what to do with them. A news release issued by the Greek police on Wednesday afternoon said that about 2,300 migrants had been transferred to temporary accommodations in Athens. Most are from Pakistan, Somalia, Morocco, Algeria and Bangladesh, the statement said.\nThe Greek police are also trying to prevent a new buildup of migrants along the border with Macedonia by intercepting them as they enter the country and sending all those who are not Syrian, Iraqi or Afghan to Athens.\nMost of the stranded have sold all they owned \u2014 homes, motorcycles and even textbooks \u2014 to make it this far. It is not clear that the migrants who continue to stream into Greece are aware that only those from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan will be allowed to continue north.\nThe number of arrivals in Greece fluctuates enormously from day to day. But since a peak of 10,000 arrivals in one day in October, the number has generally declined to an average of about 2,000 a day during the first week of December. No one knows how many more may be in the pipeline, too far gone to turn back and undeterred by the growing risks of winter weather. The Greek authorities said Wednesday that at least 12 people had drowned when a boat carrying as many as 50 migrants capsized in the Aegean.\nThose who now find their route blocked say there is little or no distinction between the countries they came from and Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\u201cWe have a war in Yemen,\u201d said Waled al-Shaibani, 20, who has been at the border for 10 days and is living in an empty boxcar on the nearby train tracks. \u201cWe are being bombed by Saudi Arabia. Why is that different?\u201d\nBut the guards at the border, he said, just pushed him away.\nDoctors Without Borders, the aid agency that runs the camp, said it got no warning before Macedonia began sending back anyone who was not from Iraq, Syria or Afghanistan.\n\u201cOne day, just like that, the policy changed,\u201d said Yvonne Ovesson, who manages food distribution at the camp. \u201cI don\u2019t think Greek officials knew it was coming.\u201d\nIt is not clear how the new policy came into being. The Macedonian government has said little about it, but it went into effect as a succession of countries to the north made similar decisions to weed out those migrants they believe are coming to get jobs rather than to flee wars.\nGermany has been pressing neighboring countries to better regulate the flow across its borders. It already has a system in place to screen and deport migrants who make it that far but are judged not to qualify for asylum.\nThe process of screening migrants by nationality has left thousands trapped along the way, with as many as 6,000 living at times in the mud along this border, their fury bubbling over almost daily with protests and efforts to storm or tear down the new fence, which now stretches nearly 40 miles and sparkles in the sunlight. But to no avail.\nThe Macedonian police have responded at times with tear gas and rubber bullets. One Moroccan man died when, in a melee, he climbed onto the roof of a train car and touched the electricity cables overhead.\nAs the flow of migrants grew last summer, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany stepped in to assure them that her country would keep its doors open.\nNow, Ms. Ovesson said, many of the men, women and children camped along the Greece-Macedonia border are hoping that Ms. Merkel will speak up for them, too.\n\u201cThey ask all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cHas Angela said anything?\u201d\nBut Ms. Merkel, struggling to find shelter for the hundreds of thousands of new arrivals that have already made it to Germany and with her popularity ratings dropping, has said nothing to indicate she wants the new policy to be changed.\nSome of the people who have risked their lives to get here are simply poor and looking for a way to support families back home. Mohamed Wadi, an 18-year-old soccer player from Morocco, said his club did not pay him to play while the managers made money. \u201cI only want a chance,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m the oldest with three brothers that I need to support.\u201d\nBut others, ranging from the Yemenis to a group from the Baluchistan region of Pakistan, which has been racked with violence, and dozens of Iranians, who fear imprisonment or worse because they are Christian, gay or political activists, can make an effective case for asylum in Europe, experts say.\nNow, however, it seems that Greece, a virtually bankrupt country with an unemployment rate of more than 25 percent, may be the end of the road for them. Many refuse to accept this idea, walking the fence to see where they might be able to sneak past the Macedonian guards.\n\u201cI will crawl up that mountain if I have to,\u201d said Amir Lalenia, a 31-year-old Iranian, who said he wants to be free to practice his Christian faith.\n\u201cI left home for good,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not going back. If we could live there, why would we be here? There are not just bombs that are dangerous, you know.\u201d\nThe Greek authorities have objected to the new triage by nationality, calling it unfair. In an email, Greece\u2019s minister for migration policy, Ioannis Mouzalas, said the Greek government had \u201crepeatedly expressed\u201d its disagreement with what was going on at the border. \u201cThis categorization also contravenes the principles of the United Nations,\u201d he said.\nBut some experts say the decision to take only Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis is a simple numbers calculation. They are the nationalities who are generally granted asylum more than 70 percent of the time.\n\u201cThere are so many people coming that people are just looking for a way to slow things down,\u201d said Daniel Esdras, the head of the Greek office of the International Organization for Migration. \u201cIt\u2019s not nice to categorize people like this, but what can you do?\u201d\nThe migration organization, which generally provides migrants with plane tickets and a little start-up money to go home, ran out of funds in June this year and only recently got emergency funding that could help 1,000 people return to their countries of origin.\nBut at the border, few say they would consider such a thing, and it appears that Greece will be left with the job of deciding on asylum applications and resettling those who decide to stay.\nMany of those now being shuttled back from the border to Athens are being housed in former Olympic stadium sites, which have been abandoned for years.\nThere were more than 500 people, many sleeping on the floor, in the administrative building of the former hockey stadium on a recent evening. Some had come back from the border. Others had not been there yet.\n\u201cWe are full,\u201d said Marios Karagiannakis, the shift supervisor at the stadium. \u201cBut they keep coming. I leave at 2 a.m., and when I get back there are another 60.\u201d",

    "text": "ISIS and the Lonely Young American\n2015-06-27T15:26:25.000Z\nAlex, a 23-year-old Sunday school teacher and babysitter, was trembling with excitement the day she told her Twitter followers that she had converted to Islam.\nFor months, she had been growing closer to a new group of friends online \u2014 the most attentive she had ever had \u2014 who were teaching her what it meant to be a Muslim. Increasingly, they were telling her about the Islamic State and how the group was building a homeland in Syria and Iraq where the holy could live according to God\u2019s law.\nOne in particular, Faisal, had become her nearly constant companion, spending hours each day with her on Twitter, Skype and email, painstakingly guiding her through the fundamentals of the faith.\nBut when she excitedly told him that she had found a mosque just five miles from the home she shared with her grandparents in rural Washington State, he suddenly became cold.\nThe only Muslims she knew were those she had met online, and he encouraged her to keep it that way, arguing that Muslims are persecuted in the United States. She could be labeled a terrorist, he warned, and for now it was best for her to keep her conversion secret, even from her family.\nSo on his guidance, Alex began leading a double life. She kept teaching at her church, but her truck\u2019s radio was no longer tuned to the Christian hits on K-LOVE. Instead, she hummed along with the ISIS anthems blasting out of her turquoise iPhone, and began daydreaming about what life with the militants might be like.\n\u201cI felt like I was betraying God and Christianity,\u201d said Alex, who spoke on the condition that she be identified only by a pseudonym she uses online. \u201cBut I also felt excited because I had made a lot of new friends.\u201d\nEven though the Islamic State\u2019s ideology is explicitly at odds with the West, the group is making a relentless effort to recruit Westerners into its ranks, eager to exploit them for their outsize propaganda value. Through January this year, at least 100 Americans were thought to have traveled to join jihadists in Syria and Iraq, among nearly 4,000 Westerners who had done so.\nThe reach of the Islamic State\u2019s recruiting effort has been multiplied by an enormous cadre of operators on social media. The terrorist group itself maintains a 24-hour online operation, and its effectiveness is vastly extended by larger rings of sympathetic volunteers and fans who pass on its messages and viewpoint, reeling in potential recruits, analysts say.\nAlex\u2019s online circle \u2014 involving several dozen accounts, some operated by people who directly identified themselves as members of the Islamic State or whom terrorism analysts believe to be directly linked to the group \u2014 collectively spent thousands of hours engaging her over more than six months. They sent her money and plied her with gifts of chocolate. They indulged her curiosity and calmed her apprehensions as they ushered her toward the hard-line theological concepts that ISIS is built on.\nAs a Christian, Alex presented the need for an extra step in the process. Yet she helped close the gap herself: Trying to explain the attraction, she said she had already been drawn to the idea of living a faith more fully.\nExtensive interviews with Alex and her family, along with a review of the emails, Twitter posts, private messages and Skype chats she exchanged, which they agreed to share with The New York Times on the condition that their real names and hometown not be revealed, offered a rare window into the intense effort to indoctrinate a young American woman, increasing her sense of isolation from her family and community.\n\u201cAll of us have a natural firewall in our brain that keeps us from bad ideas,\u201d said Nasser Weddady, a Middle East expert who is preparing a research paper on combating extremist propaganda. \u201cThey look for weaknesses in the wall, and then they attack.\u201d\nTo get to Alex\u2019s house from the nearest town, visitors turn off at a trailer park and drive for a mile past wide, irrigated fields of wheat and alfalfa.\n\u201cMy grandparents enjoy living in the middle of nowhere. I enjoy community,\u201d Alex said. \u201cIt gets lonely here.\u201d\nShe has lived with her grandparents for almost all her life: When she was 11 months old, her mother, struggling with drug addiction, lost custody of her. Her therapist says that fetal alcohol syndrome, which has left Alex with tremors in her hands, has also contributed to a persistent lack of maturity and poor judgment.\nThat only partly explains what happened to her online, her family says.\nAfter dropping out of college last year, she was earning $300 a month babysitting two days a week and teaching Sunday school for children at her church on weekends. At home, she spent hours streaming movies on Netflix and updating her social media timelines.\n\u201cAll the other kids spread their wings and flew,\u201d says her 68-year-old grandmother, who has raised eight children and grandchildren in a modest but tidy home the size of a double-wide trailer. \u201cShe is like a lost child.\u201d\nThen on Aug. 19, her phone vibrated with a CNN alert.\nJames Foley, a journalist she had never heard of, had been beheaded by ISIS, a group she knew nothing about. The searing image of the young man kneeling as the knife was lifted to his throat stayed with her.\nRiveted by the killing, and struck by a horrified curiosity, she logged on to Twitter to see if she could learn more.\n\u201cI was looking for people who agreed with what they were doing, so that I could understand why they were doing it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was actually really easy to find them.\u201d\nShe found herself shocked again, this time by the fact that people who openly identified as belonging to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, took the time to politely answer her questions.\n\u201cOnce they saw that I was sincere in my curiosity, they were very kind,\u201d she said. \u201cThey asked questions about my family, about where I was from, about what I wanted to do in life.\u201d\nOne of the first relationships she struck up was with a man who told her he was an ISIS fighter named Monzer Hamad, stationed near Damascus, the Syrian capital.\nSoon they were chatting for hours every day, their interactions giddy, filled with smiley faces and exclamations of \u201cLOL.\u201d\n\u201cHole,\u201d she wrote at 10:13 a.m. on Oct. 6.\nA minute later, she added: \u201cHello* stupid autocorrect.\u201d\nHe replied: \u201chaha how are you?\u201d\n\u201cdid you think of what i said aboyt islam,\u201d he asked, his messages sprinkled with typos.\nWhat happened next tracks closely with the recommendations in a manual written by Al Qaeda in Iraq, the group that became the Islamic State, titled \u201cA Course in the Art of Recruiting.\u201d A copy was recovered by United States forces in Iraq in 2009.\nThe pamphlet advises spending as much time as possible with prospective recruits, keeping in regular touch. The recruiter should \u201clisten to his conversation carefully\u201d and \u201cshare his joys and sadness\u201d in order to draw closer.\nThen the recruiter should focus on instilling the basics of Islam, making sure not to mention jihad.\n\u201cStart with the religious rituals and concentrate on them,\u201d says the manual, which was reviewed in the archive of the Conflict Records Research Center at the National Defense University in Washington.\nHamad instructed Alex to download the Islamic Hub app on her iPhone. It sent her a daily \u201chadith,\u201d or saying by the Prophet Muhammad.\nShe felt as if she finally had something to do.\n\u201cI was on my own a lot, and they were online all the time,\u201d she said.\nHer Twitter timeline through that period is peppered with posts from her that begin, \u201cSincere question,\u201d followed by a theological query. They were answered immediately. If before she waited hours to hear back from friends, now her iPhone was vibrating all day with status updates, notifications, emoticons and Skype voice mail messages.\nShe occasionally pushed back, questioning how the jihadists could justify beheadings. But she had already developed deep doubts about the Islamic State\u2019s portrayal in the media as brutal killers.\n\u201cI knew that what people were saying about them wasn\u2019t true,\u201d she said.\nHer Skype discussions had even uncovered an unexpected bit of common ground with Hamad, who seemed to know a lot about the Bible.\nLater in October, Hamad asked her to reread the Bible and report back on how Christ described himself.\nHe guided her to verses like John 12:44: \u201cAnd Jesus Christ cried out and said, \u2018Whoever believes in me, believes not in me, but in He who sent me.\u2019 \u201d\nHe explained to her that Christ was a man who deserved to be revered as a prophet. But he was not God.\nThe discussion unmoored Alex, who had chosen a quote by Jesus to illustrate her high school yearbook page.\nOne morning, roughly two months after she first began communicating with ISIS supporters, Alex asked to see the pastor of her Presbyterian church. She wanted to know whether the idea of the Trinity that Christians believed in \u2014 God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit \u2014 meant they were polytheists.\nFriendly at first, the pastor ushered her out after 15 minutes, telling her she needed to trust in the mystery of God, she said.\nThe arguments she was hearing online are the textbook approach to luring Christians to radical Islam, says Mubin Shaikh, a former member and recruiter for an extremist Islamist group, who testified before Congress on the mechanics of radicalization and was among those who tried to intervene online as Alex drifted toward extremism.\n\u201cI was debating Christians using these same arguments on Yahoo and AOL chat back in the 1990s, when modems made that loud, beeping sound,\u201d said Mr. Shaikh, who traveled to Pakistan to meet the Taliban before renouncing his radical views and becoming an undercover operative for Canadian intelligence.\nThe next time she attended service, Alex did not stand when the pastor invited the congregation to take communion.\n\u201cWhat you do not know is that i am not inviting you to leave christianity,\u201d Hamad wrote, when she relayed what she had done. \u201cIslam is the correction of christianity.\u201d\nTwo days later, Alex wrote: \u201cI can agree that Muhammad and Jesus are prophets not God.\u201d\nHe responded, \u201cSo what are you waiting for to become a muslim?\u201d\nSoon after, his Skype icon went gray.\nDay after day, she looked for him, but he was gone. She wondered whether he had died in battle.\nBy the last week of October, Alex was communicating with more than a dozen people who openly admired the Islamic State. Her life, which had mostly seemed like a blurred series of babysitting shifts and lonely weekends roaming the mall, was now filled with encouragement and tutorials from her online friends.\nOne of her new Muslim \u201csisters\u201d sent Alex a $200 gift certificate to IslamicBookstore.com. She and others chose books for Alex and mailed them to her home. They included an English-language Quran and a basic study guide.\nAmong the people who picked up where Hamad left off was a Twitter user called Voyager, whose profile picture showed white stallions galloping through crashing waves.\nIn November, he asked for her email address and told her his name was Faisal Mostafa and that he lived in Stockport, near Manchester, England. He asked for her Skype ID, and soon they began chatting, cameras turned off in keeping with Muslim rules on modesty.\nHe typically came online when it was 3 p.m. for Alex, and before long they were talking for hours each day, sometimes till 10 p.m. When she calculated the time difference, she realized Faisal was chatting with her from around 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. his time.\nAlthough he spent all night nearly every night speaking to her, the conversation remained strictly platonic, she said. Each day he had prepared a lesson, starting with the fundamentals of praying. They included the wudu, the ritual washing of the hands, wrists, arms, face and feet before each of the five daily prayers. And he emphasized the need for Muslims to place their heads on the ground while praying, citing a Bible verse in which Jesus did so.\nShe knelt next to her bed, her forehead touching the fuzzy carpet.\nAfter dropping out of college, Alex worked for a year at a day-care center, only to resign after a disagreement with her manager. She quit a call-center training program after three weeks, she said, unable to handle angry calls from customers.\nHer online conversations became a touchstone at a time when she was increasingly adrift.\nMuch of it was innocuous banter, ranging from gardening tips (\u201cTry planting purple asparagus\u201d) to dietary advice (\u201cTry bitter melon tea to lower blood glucose\u201d). Other times, though, the talk focused on the details of an uncompromising Muslim life. By the time Christmas arrived, she felt she had crossed a line.\nShe asked Faisal what it would take to convert.\nHe explained that all she needed to do was repeat the phrase \u201cThere is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger,\u201d with complete belief and commitment, in the presence of two Muslims.\nThis presented an obstacle for Alex, who still knew no Muslims in person. Faisal argued that she could post her declaration of faith, known as the Shahada, on Twitter, and the first two people who read it would count as her witnesses.\nThe night of Dec. 28, as her family watched television, Alex quietly closed the door. She sat on her bed, a crucifix on the bookshelf beside her. For a moment she thought she might throw up.\nJust after 9 p.m. she logged on to Twitter.\nFaisal acknowledged her declaration right away. So did another online friend, who went by the screen name Hallie Sheikh and whom Faisal had asked to serve as the second witness.\nWithin hours, Alex had doubled her Twitter following. \u201cI actually have brothers and sisters,\u201d she posted before going to bed. \u201cI\u2019m crying.\u201d\nMonths later, the Hallie Sheikh Twitter handle came to public attention: That account had briefly interacted with Elton Simpson, the gunman who opened fire on a contest to draw the Prophet Muhammad in Texas, an attack dedicated to the Islamic State.\nStarting in January, packages began arriving on the stoop of Alex\u2019s home, bearing the Royal Mail logo and Faisal\u2019s address in England. Inside were pastel-colored hijabs, a green prayer rug, and books that took her into a stricter interpretation of Islam.\nShe was excited to receive them, but at times the lessons they contained seemed foreign to Alex, even silly \u2013 like the admonition against wearing nail polish, because it prevented water from reaching her fingernails when she performed wudu.\nOne pamphlet hewed to the most extreme interpretations of Islam, laying out \u201cThe Rights and Duties of Women.\u201d Those included unquestioning acceptance of polygamy, and warned that daughters should expect to receive only half the inheritance of sons.\nEach bubble-wrapped package Faisal sent her included bars of Lindt chocolate.\nShe said he explained why the brand had special significance: It was inside the Lindt Chocolate Cafe in Sydney, Australia, that a man claiming to be acting in the name of ISIS held a group of employees and customers hostage in a 16-hour standoff in December.\nAt the urging of another Twitter user, she skimmed a biography of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the self-declared caliph of the Islamic State.\nBy late January, she had split her life in two, heeding Faisal\u2019s admonition to \u201ckeep a low profile.\u201d She kept her hijab in the back seat of her truck, pulling it over her frizzy red hair only when out of sight of her house.\nChurch days were the hardest. She continued to prepare her Sunday school lessons, doing her best to sound convincing. In the pews, she bowed her head alongside the rest of the congregation, though in her heart her prayers were different.\nThe only person who knew of her conversion was her cousin, who was starting to flirt with the idea herself. Together they went to the Dollar Store and bought two toilet plungers. In a park, they put on their head scarves and used the handles to spar in an imaginary sword fight.\nWhen Alex\u2019s grandmother became suspicious about the overseas packages, Faisal arranged to send them to the cousin\u2019s home.\nBut Alex felt increasingly distressed about lying to her family. And as her secret grew, so did her sense of isolation.\nMr. Shaikh, who spent years recruiting for extremist groups before recanting, says the isolation is intentional. \u201cWe look for people who are isolated,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if they are not isolated already, then we isolated them.\u201d\nWeeks after she converted, Alex had still not met any Muslims in real life.\nOnline, she discovered that there was a mosque near her home. When Faisal looked it up, though, he learned that the mosque\u2019s steering committee had posted a statement disavowing the Islamic State. He dissuaded her from going, saying it was a government-infiltrated mosque, she said.\nIn early February, a number of other Twitter users, including Mr. Shaikh, read Alex\u2019s timeline and recognized the signs of her growing radicalization. They threw lifelines into the digital sea.\n\u201cI know they seem sweet,\u201d wrote one who went by the handle @KindLadyAdilah. \u201cThey are grooming you,\u201d she added, \u201cIf you went there you would die or worse.\u201d\n\u201cCan I just ignore them?\u201d Alex asked, \u201cI swear I have, like since last night, cutting off ties is hard and they gave me stuff.\u201d\nOn Feb. 13, @KindLadyAdilah advised her to stop accepting their gifts. Alex promised she would tell Faisal to stop sending them.\nBut a few days later another envelope arrived at her cousin\u2019s house, containing more chocolate and a Hallmark card decorated with a cutout of a kitten. When she opened it, two $20 bills fell out.\n\u201cPlease go out and enjoy a Pizza TOGETHER,\u201d it says, signed, \u201cTwitter friends.\u201d\nAlex spent her Valentine\u2019s Day curled up on her bed, discussing the theological justification for suicide bombings with an ISIS supporter. She does not know his real name or even what he looks like \u2013 his profile picture was of a roaring lion. His handle was @SurgeonOfDeath.\nBy mid-February, Alex\u2019s virtual community began making more demands. They told her that as a good Muslim she needed to stop following people on social media who were \u201ckuffar,\u201d or infidels.\nThe fact that she continued to follow a handful of her Christian friends proved to be unacceptable. On Feb. 16, a user on Twitter who openly supported the Islamic State accused Alex of being a spy.\nImmediately, people she considered her friends began blocking her.\nIf only days earlier she had been trying to disentangle herself, now she was begging them not to cut her off. She offered to provide her Twitter password to anyone who wanted to examine her messages.\n\u201cTo whom it may concern,\u201d she wrote. \u201cA bunch of people thought I was a spy and I\u2019m not, honest,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a Muslim since December 28th and I took the Shahada on Twitter and I\u2019m about 92% sure that being Muslim saved my life.\u201d\nIt was Faisal who interceded on her behalf.\nHe introduced her to the administrator of the @InviteToIslam account. According to the Middle East Media Research Institute, a Washington-based group that monitors jihadist propaganda, the account belongs to a radical Islamist group based in Birmingham, England, that is in regular contact with ISIS fighters. The administrator of the account is accused of having played a role in the radicalization of a 15-year-old English girl who left to join ISIS earlier this year, according to media reports.\nThe @InviteToIslam administrator arranged for Alex to do \u201ca Skype verification.\u201d After an exhaustive interrogation about her online contacts and intent, she was cleared.\n\u201cYour a nice person with a beautiful character,\u201d Faisal wrote her three days after the ordeal. \u201cIn many ways ur much better than many so called born muslims.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cgetting someone 2 marry is no problem Inshallah.\u201d\nA few more days passed before he elaborated: \u201cI know someone who will marry you but hes not good looking, 45 bald but nice muslim.\u201d\nIn their hourslong Skype sessions, Faisal emphasized that it is a sin for a Muslim to stay among nonbelievers, and their talk increasingly began revolving around her traveling to \u201ca Muslim land.\u201d Though he never mentioned Syria, Alex understood that was what he meant, she said.\nShe had already begun to imagine her role with the Islamic State as a mother, she said \u2014 a goal that felt painfully elusive in rural Washington, where her last relationship ended traumatically years earlier.\nOn Feb. 19, Faisal suggested she meet him in Austria so that he could introduce her to her future husband, she said. Alex would need to be accompanied by her \u201cmahram,\u201d or male relative. When she asked whether her 11-year-old brother could fulfill that role, Faisal said that would be acceptable.\nA greeting card to Alex from her \u201cTwitter friends.\u201d\nA greeting card to Alex from her \u201cTwitter friends.\u201d\nA note thanking Alex\u2019s cousin for providing her address for deliveries.\nA birthday card for Alex\u2019s younger brother from her online friends.\nTwo days later, he began asking how and when Alex could get herself and her little brother to Austria.\n\u201cTickets 2 Austria rtn are not that expensive inshallah when (your brother) is ready both come 4 hloiday I\u2019ll buy ur tickets,\u201d he messaged on Feb. 21.\nThree minutes later he added: \u201chow long it goin to take (your brother) 2 get out?\u201d\nIt was around then that Alex began suspecting that Faisal was speaking with other women, too. He acknowledged it, but shrugged it off: \u201cMy wife says shes fine with me & my female twitter sisters as long as i don\u2019t run off to syria with them ha ha ha.\u201d\nIt was only then that Alex searched his name on Google, she said.\nOver multiple pages of results, she learned that a man named Faisal Mostafa who ran his own Islamic charity called the Green Crescent, with the same address that the packages to her had come from, was originally from Bangladesh, in his 50s and married with children.\nIn 1995, the police raided Mr. Mostafa\u2019s home, finding firearms, bullets, shotgun cartridges, timers and explosives, according to the court minutes. Initially accused of plotting a terrorist attack, he received a four-year sentence for firearms possession, after arguing that the explosives were part of his Ph.D. research at Manchester Polytechnic on the corrosion inside tin cans.\nHe was arrested a second time in 2000, along with another Bangladeshi immigrant. In a trash bag left outside a building where the two had met, investigators found plastic gloves, a kitchen scale and traces of the explosive HMTD, according to news reports. On Mr. Mostafa\u2019s computer, they found a document titled \u201cMujahedin Explosives Handbook.\u201d\nWhile his co-defendant received a 20-year sentence for plotting a large-scale explosion, Faisal Mostafa was acquitted.\nOn March 25, 2009, Mr. Mostafa was arrested during a trip back to Bangladesh after the police raided the orphanage run by his charity. According to the court record, investigators determined he had been running a bomb-making factory, after finding explosives and a library of jihadist literature. \u201cIt has been proven by the evidence and testimonies that Faisal Mostafa and 11 others,\u201d the court proceeding said, \u201chad chalked out a blueprint for grooming each child as a militant.\u201d\nHe was repatriated to Britain in 2010 after a nearly one-year detention in Bangladesh.\nAlex sheepishly asked him about the jail stints, apologetic for prying into his past. She said he acknowledged having been imprisoned, but characterized it as unfair harassment because of his Muslim faith. He said he had been tortured while in custody.\nMultiple attempts to reach Faisal Mostafa for comment were unsuccessful, including by Skype, repeated emails and letters delivered, and accepted, at the address from where he sent Alex packages.\nAlex\u2019s grandmother often wakes up before dawn. That is how she noticed that her granddaughter was not sleeping much \u2013 seeing her face framed by the halo of her tablet computer in the dark. They began having regular fights, until March, when Alex\u2019s family decided to confiscate her computer and phone at night.\nAlex said she found ways to sneak messages to her online community, borrowing phones from friends.\nOn a sunny morning in late March, Alex\u2019s grandmother decided to confront the man she believed was trying to recruit Alex to the Islamic State.\nThe family gathered on the brown couch in the living room, Alex\u2019s computer propped on the glass coffee table, with a Times reporter and videographer watching. Her grandmother logged in using Alex\u2019s Skype ID.\nNo answer. She tried again, and again.\nMany tries and more than an hour later, he answered: \u201cSalaam aleikum. Can you hear me?\u201d\nAlex\u2019s grandmother identified herself. \u201cI can hear you,\u201d she said.\nHe hung up.\nUnsure what else to do, Alex\u2019s grandmother typed out a long Skype message to him.\n\u201cYou need to know she is very important to us,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhy would you EVER think that we would let her leave us under the circumstances you were asking?\u201d\nShe continued: \u201cWhat are you thinking? We have raised her 24 years to be a faithful Christian woman. Not to be brain washed by you.\u201d\nAfter a few minutes, the family saw an ellipsis next to Faisal\u2019s icon, indicating he was replying.\n\u201cI understand you may consider us being radical Muslims whatever that maybe? Well please don\u2019t believe everything on fox news!!\u201d he writes, his message riddled with typos. \u201cWe don\u2019t agree with terrorism AT ALL \u2026 You have my word but also the word of her friends IN NO way will we ever try to make her harm others or do anything which is illegal.\u201d\nShe typed: \u201cNothing you say explains the offer of a trip to Austria, the free ticket, the offer of a marriage deal with an old, bald man.\u201d\nHe replied that the marriage offer was \u201ca joke.\u201d\nThen he gave his word he would not contact Alex again.\nAfterward, Alex agreed to hand over the passwords to her Twitter and email accounts. Her grandmother changed them to prevent her from using them. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents came to the house and downloaded her electronic communication history after Alex\u2019s family contacted the agency. An F.B.I. official at state headquarters would not discuss details of the case.\nIn an email to the family, one of the agents later wrote that no one wanted \u201cto see her get caught up in any of the dangers that she has been extremely close to in the past.\u201d But he acknowledged that Alex was also under scrutiny, saying the agency\u2019s goal was not just to keep her safe, \u201cbut also the rest of the country safe as well.\u201d\nAfter the online showdown with Faisal, Alex and her grandparents left for a much-needed vacation in their recreational vehicle, seeking to reconnect.\nAlex found she could not stay away from her online friend for long, though.

    "text": "Jackson Heights Through the Eyes of Frederick Wiseman\n2015-10-30T16:32:21.000Z\nIn June, Frederick Wiseman, the 85-year-old master of American documentary filmmaking, found himself short of cash to finish his latest film, his 42nd, about the neighborhood of Jackson Heights, Queens. At the urging of his producer, he turned to Kickstarter.\nFund-raising for documentary films is never easy, even for a giant like Mr. Wiseman. But during his 49-year career, the effort to raise money had been a quieter, more private struggle. This crowdsourcing thing was, for him, something entirely new \u2014 and entirely uncomfortable.\n\u201cHello, I\u2019m Fred Wiseman,\u201d the filmmaker began in his bare-bones video pitch. \u201cI\u2019ve been making documentary films since 1966.\u201d His weary expression and lackluster delivery, combined with the low production quality, suggested a man who would have preferred to be doing just about anything else.\nThe campaign failed, falling well short of its goal of $75,000. \u201cI regretted doing it, and I\u2019ll never do it again,\u201d he acknowledged in a recent interview. \u201cIt\u2019s fine for some people, but I find the whole thing demeaning.\u201d\nThe Kickstarter detour aside, Mr. Wiseman has taken an uncompromising approach to his art. His films are immersive studies of \u201cinstitutions,\u201d as he likes to say, covering subjects as varied as a public-housing project, a modeling agency, a university, a racetrack and a monastery. They are particularly notable for their absence of narration, voice-over, talking heads and supplemental soundtracks. And they are often very long \u2014 the longest is six hours \u2014 which has probably not helped their salability.\nBut his commitment to this style and form is a muscular demonstration of conviction, and stands as an act of defiance in an era of ever-narrowing attention spans and accelerating media.\nThis is no less the case with his latest film, in which he turns his patient eye on Jackson Heights, one of the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in New York City, which has a particularly large immigrant population from Latin America, South Asia and elsewhere. The film, \u201cIn Jackson Heights,\u201d will have its world theatrical premiere at Film Forum in Manhattan on Wednesday.\nMr. Wiseman is already deep into shooting his next project \u2014 he would not publicly disclose the subject except to say that it was also in New York City. But he set aside several hours the other day to talk about \u201cIn Jackson Heights\u201d and his career, a conversation that began at a Bangladeshi restaurant in the neighborhood and segued into a walking tour of some of the locations where he filmed.\n\u201cWhat kind of nice sweets do you have?\u201d Mr. Wiseman inquired of the counter staff at Ittadi Garden & Grill, which not long ago was a theater that showed Bollywood movies and, before that, pornographic films. His compact frame was draped in a faded, untucked polo shirt, corduroy trousers and an unstructured jacket.\nA plate bearing two small neon-colored confections appeared, and he considered them for a moment. \u201cOrange and pink something-or-others,\u201d he said, a slight fluctuation in the soft furrows of his face signaling amusement. A spray of wispy hair pointed toward the ceiling. He looked tired.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take the risk of seeing what they taste like,\u201d he said.\nHis decision to shoot a film about the neighborhood did not spring from a great epiphany or emerge from extensive research. By his account, it just kind of happened.\nThe son of a Russian immigrant father, he had been interested in making a film about a neighborhood with new immigrants, and friends living in Jackson Heights invited him to visit.\n\u201cI walked around a bit and I decided that Jackson Heights was the next one,\u201d the filmmaker said. Though he is not a New Yorker \u2014 he was born and raised in Boston and now splits his time between Cambridge, Mass., and Paris \u2014 he has been repeatedly drawn to subjects in the city, where he has shot nearly a quarter of his documentaries.\nBeyond the neighborhood\u2019s array of ethnicities and cultures, he was struck by its aesthetics. \u201cThe colors of Jackson Heights are just extraordinary,\u201d he said. \u201cVisually, it\u2019s an absolute feast.\u201d\nBefore he began filming last year, he contacted several community organizations as well as civic and elected leaders and introduced himself. He cultivated two key local sources \u2014 \u201cinformants, in the best sense of the word,\u201d as he called them \u2014 who helped open doors.\nWorking with his longtime cameraman, John Davey, and an assistant, Mr. Wiseman started shooting in May 2014 and worked nearly every day, 12 hours a day, for nine weeks. (When he is not on a shoot, he said, he stays in shape by cycling and doing \u201ca whole bunch of exercises.\u201d)\nMr. Wiseman, the 85-year-old dean of American documentary filmmaking, has made 40 documentaries, nine of them about subjects in New York.\n\u201cThe analogy for making one of these movies is Las Vegas, because it\u2019s always a roll of the dice,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only point of view I start off with is that if I hang around long enough, I\u2019ll find a movie.\u201d\nMr. Wiseman had not visited the neighborhood since he finished filming, so he suggested taking a stroll and perhaps visiting some of his sources. He ambled out of the diner and into the tumult of Roosevelt Avenue, the lively commercial corridor that runs along the neighborhood\u2019s southern border.\nIn a nearby building, he climbed three flights of stairs and found Muhammad Rashid, a Bangladeshi immigrant who runs a tutoring academy, overseeing a classroom of schoolchildren. Mr. Rashid was one of his \u201cinformants.\u201d\n\u201cThe famous man is here!\u201d Mr. Rashid exclaimed, and he insisted on giving Mr. Wiseman a tour of all of the improvements he had made to the building. He showed off a yoga studio as well as the roof terrace, from which the filmmaker had made the opening and closing shots of \u201cIn Jackson Heights.\u201d\nMr. Wiseman filmed much of the movie around Roosevelt Avenue and another main commercial strip, 37th Avenue, often responding to whatever the streets offered up and reaping the rewards of serendipity.\nAs with his other documentaries, the movie has no conventional narrative, but rather is a mosaic of vignettes that, in their totality, give a sense of the area\u2019s complex social and political tapestry, raising questions about immigration and integration; gay, workers\u2019 and immigrants\u2019 rights; and gentrification.\nThere are scenes from houses of worship; a gay pride march; and various gatherings of immigrants, laborers, small-business owners, older adults andtransgender people. Mr. Wiseman also sat in on a class for student taxi drivers, a visit that produced one of the most humorous scenes of the film. (\u201cI knew that I\u2019d led a clean and moral life when God gave me that sequence,\u201d Mr. Wiseman said.)\nHe lets the camera linger on the seemingly ordinary (and not so ordinary) in search of drama, humor and meaning. A small dog is fitted with a Mexican soccer jersey in a pet store. An odd musical performance involving small cymbals occurs at a laundromat. A customer stops by a botanica seeking the repair of the severed arm of a baby Jesus figurine. Workers kill and skin chickens at a halal slaughterhouse. The hands of an eyebrow-threading aesthetician dance over a client\u2019s face like a puppeteer\u2019s.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to see there are still plenty of street vendors out,\u201d Mr. Wiseman murmured as he maneuvered himself along a sidewalk on Roosevelt Avenue crowded with shoppers, commuters and hawkers selling plastic toys, children\u2019s clothes, flowers, food and cellphone accessories.\nAs he walked, his remarks were spare. He noted that new planters had been installed at the entrance of a building since his last visit. He spotted a new building that had been constructed at a site of one that had been destroyed by a serious fire. He pointed out a tattoo parlor and a dance studio where he had filmed.\n\u201cThere\u2019s great material in all these places,\u201d he said, gesturing at the small businesses lining the avenue. \u201cYou can play blind man\u2019s bluff. There\u2019s great material in all these stores.\u201d\nBut he mostly walked in silence, his heavy-lidded eyes taking in the streetscape. He seemed perfectly content to let the conversation ebb and, as in his films, to allow the ambient sounds of the streets fill the void. The medley of languages. The deafening metallic screeches of the No. 7 subway on the elevated tracks. The vendors\u2019 cries. The traffic and its riot of horns.\n\u201cThere is so much music on the street, it was terrific for the film \u2014 I could use it to link the cutaways,\u201d he commented while walking through a sonic wall of salsa music blasting from a shop doorway.\nLast year, when Mr. Wiseman felt he was done shooting, he took his 120 hours of raw footage to Paris, where he lives more than half the year. Over 11 months, he edited it down to a 190-minute film.\nIn addition to the failed Kickstarter campaign, Mr. Wiseman participated this year \u2014 reluctantly, he said \u2014 in the Hot Doc Forum, a public pitch event in Toronto. But his production company, Zipporah Films, still faces a funding shortfall for \u201cIn Jackson Heights.\u201d Karen Konicek, the company\u2019s executive producer, said Zipporah hoped that proceeds from the theatrical release, DVD sales and foreign television sales would cover the gap.\n\u201cFund-raising is one of the hardest aspects and has only gotten more difficult,\u201d said Mr. Wiseman. \u201cBut the moment you think you\u2019re entitled to the money is the moment you should stop, because you have to act as if each film is your first film and you have to put the same energy into raising the money.\u201d\nHis stroll the other day took him by the Jewish Center of Jackson Heights and Make the Road New York, two community institutions that feature prominently in the film, but his main contacts at both places were out of the office. A phone call located another neighborhood character who appears in the film: Orlando Tob\u00f3n, a travel agent and a well-known member of the borough\u2019s Colombian population. Minutes later, Mr. Wiseman was hustling up the stairs to Mr. Tob\u00f3n\u2019s office.\n\u201cI\u2019m following you around,\u201d Mr. Wiseman said wryly as they shook hands.\nMr. Tob\u00f3n updated the filmmaker on various political goings-on in the community. The conversation was halting. Mr. Wiseman does not speak Spanish; Mr. Tob\u00f3n\u2019s English is incomplete. There were extended silences. Mr. Wiseman seemed in no rush to fill them.\nMr. Tob\u00f3n announced that he wanted to show his visitors a short video he made. \u201cIt\u2019s very interesting,\u201d he promised. The video was a work of autohagiography, lauding his contributions to his hometown in Colombia, including home construction for the needy and other acts of generosity. Mr. Wiseman watched respectfully, though he later acknowledged that he had understood very little.\n\u201cI have beautiful stories,\u201d Mr. Tob\u00f3n said in English after the video was over. \u201cI try to find someone maybe can help me make a movie.\u201d\nMr. Wiseman replied, \u201cI\u2019m at the wrong end of the business because I\u2019m at the documentary end.\u201d There was another silence.\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy you came to this small place,\u201d Mr. Tob\u00f3n resumed.\n\u201cI learned a lot,\u201d the filmmaker replied. \u201cThe people were very friendly with me.\u201d\nDuring the shooting of \u201cIn Jackson Heights,\u201d Mr. Wiseman said, he was able to get access to everything he wanted, with one exception: The New York Police Department denied his requests for a ride-along in a squad car, something he had done in other places, and for permission to film two police-community meetings. (His assessment: \u201cStupid.\u201d)\nAs he has over his long career, he demurred when asked to explain what his new movie was about. In the absence of such definitions, others have rushed to provide their own, at times offering sharply different interpretations.\nHe said he found the competing assessments amusing. He particularly enjoyed a recent assertion by the filmmaker Errol Morris, writing in The Paris Review, that Mr. Wiseman was \u201cthe undisputed king of misanthropic cinema.\u201d\n\u201cI was hysterical when I saw that!\u201d Mr. Wiseman exclaimed. \u201cHe\u2019s talking about himself.\u201d\nMr. Wiseman was more cutting on the subject of reviewers and academics who applied labels to his work, such as \u201cobservational cinema\u201d and \u201cdirect cinema,\u201d describing them with a pastoral epithet. \u201cThe French term \u2018cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9\u2019 is a vomit-special,\u201d he added.\n\u201cI like making movies,\u201d he continued, before jumping in a cab and heading back to Manhattan, where he has been renting an apartment during his current shoot. \u201cAnd I like making movies that meet my objective standard of good movies. And that\u2019s my ultimate goal: to make as good a movie as I can.\u201d",

    "text": "Earthquake Devastates Nepal, Killing More Than 1,900\n2015-04-25T08:47:52.000Z\nNEW DELHI \u2014 A powerful earthquake shook Nepal on Saturday near its capital, Katmandu, killing more than 1,900 people, flattening sections of the city\u2019s historic center, and trapping dozens of sightseers in a 200-foot watchtower that came crashing down into a pile of bricks.\nAs officials in Nepal faced the devastation on Sunday morning, they said that most of the 1,931 deaths occurred in Katmandu and the surrounding valley, and that more than 4,700 people had been injured. But the quake touched a vast expanse of the subcontinent. It set off avalanches around Mount Everest, where at least 17 climbers died. At least 34 deaths occurred in northern India. Buildings swayed in Tibet and Bangladesh.\nThe earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.8, struck shortly before noon, and residents of Katmandu ran into the streets and other open spaces as buildings fell, throwing up clouds of dust. Wide cracks opened on paved streets and in the walls of city buildings. Motorcycles tipped over and slid off the edge of a highway.\nBy midafternoon, the United States Geological Survey had counted 12 aftershocks, one of which measured 6.6.\ntranscript\nna\nSeismologists have expected a major earthquake in western Nepal, where there is pent-up pressure from the grinding of the Indian tectonic plate as is it forced underneath the Eurasian plate to the north. Still, witnesses described a chaotic rescue effort during the first hours after the quake as emergency workers and volunteers grabbed tools and bulldozers from construction sites, and dug with hacksaws, mangled reinforcing bars and their hands.\nThough many have worried about the stability of the concrete high-rises that have been hastily erected in Katmandu, the most terrible damage on Saturday was to the oldest part of the city, which is studded with temples and palaces made of wood and unmortared brick.\nFour of the area\u2019s seven Unesco World Heritage sites were severely damaged in the earthquake: Bhaktapur Durbar Square, a temple complex built in the shape of a conch shell; Patan Durbar Square, which dates to the third century; Basantapur Durbar Square, which was the residence of Nepal\u2019s royal family until the 19th century; and the Boudhanath Stupa, one of the oldest Buddhist monuments in the Himalayas.\nFor many, the most breathtaking architectural loss was the nine-story Dharahara Tower, which was built in 1832 on the orders of the queen. The tower had recently reopened to the public, and visitors could ascend a spiral staircase to a viewing platform around 200 feet above the city.\nThe walls were brick, around one and a half feet thick, and when the earthquake struck, they came crashing down.\nThe police said on Saturday that they had pulled about 60 bodies from the rubble of the tower. Kashish Das Shrestha, a photographer and writer, spent much of the day in the old city, but said he still had trouble grasping that the tower was gone.\n\u201cI was here yesterday, I was here the day before yesterday, and it was there,\u201d he said. \u201cToday it\u2019s just gone. Last night, from my terrace, I was looking at the tower. And today I was at the tower \u2014 and there is no tower.\u201d\nKanak Mani Dixit, a Nepalese political commentator, said he had been having lunch with his parents when the quake struck. The rolling was so intense and sustained that he had trouble getting to his feet, he said. He helped his father and an elderly neighbor to safety in the garden outside and then had to carry his elderly mother.\n\u201cAnd I had time to do all that while the quake was still going on,\u201d Mr. Dixit said. \u201cIt was like being on a boat in heavy seas.\u201d\nRoger Bilham, a professor of geological sciences at the University of Colorado, said the shaking lasted about one minute, although it continued for another minute in some places.\nThe earthquake that struck Nepal on April 25 flattened sections of Katmandu\u2019s historic center, where many structures were made with bricks.\nFor years, people have worried about an earthquake of this magnitude in western Nepal. Many feared that an immense death toll would result, in part because construction has been largely unregulated in recent years, said Ganesh K. Bhattari, a Nepalese expert on earthquakes, now living in Denmark.\nHe said the government had made some buildings more robust and reinforced vulnerable ones, but many larger buildings, like hospitals and old-age homes, remained extremely vulnerable. \u201cThere is a little bit of improvement,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is really difficult for people to implement the rules and the regulations.\u201d\nKunda Dixit, the editor of The Nepali Times, said that Nepal was still emerging from many years of turmoil \u2014 a decade-long war with Maoist insurgents, followed by chronic political uncertainty \u2014 and that contingency planning for events like earthquakes had often taken a back seat to \u201cpresent disasters.\u201d\n\u201cThe government hasn\u2019t been able to get around to a lot of things, not just disaster preparedness,\u201d Mr. Dixit said.\nSaturday\u2019s earthquake struck when schools were not in session, which may have reduced the death toll. But there was not yet a full picture of the damage to villages on the mountain ridges around Katmandu, where families live in houses made of mud and thatch.\ntranscript\nna\nAs night fell, aftershocks were still hitting, prompting waves of screaming. Many residents sat on roads for much of the day, afraid to go back indoors, and many insisted that they would spend the night outside despite the cold. Thousands camped out at the city\u2019s parade ground. The city\u2019s shops were running short of bottled water, dry food and telephone charge cards.\nToward evening, hospitals were trying to accommodate a huge influx of patients, some with amputated limbs, and were running short of supplies like bandages and trauma kits, said Jamie McGoldrick, resident coordinator with the United Nations Development Program in Nepal. Water supplies, a problem under normal circumstances in this fast-growing city, will almost certainly run short, he said.\nSearch and rescue personnel will face the challenge of reaching villages nearer the quake\u2019s epicenter, about 50 miles northwest of Katmandu, where damage may be catastrophic.\nSecretary of State John Kerry said the American ambassador to Nepal, Peter W. Bodde, had issued a disaster declaration that would allow $1 million in humanitarian assistance to be available immediately. A disaster response team and an urban search-and-rescue team from the United States Agency for International Development will also be deployed, he said in a statement,\nChina and India, which jockey for influence in the region, have pledged disaster assistance.\nOn Mount Everest, several hundred trekkers were attempting an ascent when the earthquake struck, setting off avalanches, according to climbers there. Alex Gavan, a hiker at base camp, called it a \u201chuge disaster\u201d on Twitter and described \u201crunning for life from my tent.\u201d Nima Namgyal Sherpa, a tour guide at base camp, said in a Facebook post that many camps had been destroyed.\nTremors from the quake were felt across northern India, rattling bookcases and light fixtures as far away as New Delhi. Electricity was switched off for safety reasons in the Indian state of Bihar, where three deaths were reported in one district, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, India\u2019s minister of skill development, told reporters in New Delhi. Two deaths were reported in another district.\nThe region has been the site of the largest earthquakes in the Himalayas, including a 2005 quake in the Kashmir region and a 1905 earthquake in Kangra, India.",

    "text": "The Displaced: Introduction\n2015-11-05T10:55:05.000Z\nI have two photos on my desk. The first shows a child, a girl of about 10. She is standing behind an enormous pile of her family\u2019s belongings, which have been tightly packed for a long journey. Her face is blank with uncertainty, but she strikes a bossy pose \u2014 one hand on her hip, the other planted firmly against the bundles. Her companions are an older woman, probably her mother, and a little boy \u2014 her younger brother? Both look directly at the photographer, Henri Cartier-Bresson, who took this picture in Dessau, as scores of Germans displaced during World War II began returning home. It is 1945. Where has this girl been, and what has she seen?\nThe second picture, taken in 1974, also shows a girl of about 10. This child is a Kurdish refugee. Her family is sitting with their worldly possessions in a barren field, somewhere near the border with Iran. A meal is underway. The parents sit cross-legged on the ground, intent on their food, while the girl stands, another little girl by her side, and stares into the distance with a wrinkled-brow expression of adult worry. Where is she going?\nYoung as these girls are, they have already been asked to bear a profound loss. You can see it in their faces. They appear to be only half children, the other half having been matured ahead of schedule by trauma and displacement. They know what they should not. And yet, there is still that other half. They are still kids. Unlike the adults in the frame, who must be constantly aware of their dangerous ordeal, the girls, from time to time, might forget. If the moment was right, they might play a game.\nThat children, even under the worst of circumstances, are able to remain children supplies the world around them with the sense of a future, which is the equivalent of hope. The history of the world is a history of wars \u2014 the sieges of Jerusalem, the Mongol conquests, the Mexican Revolution, World Wars I and II, the Taiping Rebellion, the Armenian genocide, the Napoleonic Wars, the Dungan Revolt, the Vietnam War, the Seven Years\u2019 War, the 30 Years\u2019 War, the Roman civil wars, the Chinese Civil War, the American Civil War, the Chilean civil wars, the Liberian civil wars, the Spanish Civil War. These and countless others are usually fought by young adults and overseen by old men, and it is their experiences that historians tend to consider. But children (and their mothers) are present, too. Those who are not killed wind up displaced, surviving in camps and bombed-out villages, where by their mere presence they contribute to the continuance of humankind. Less obvious than the biological fact of this is the psychological one. If there were no children, would the adults of a refugee camp have the will to endure?\nWith so many wars behind us, so many around us and so many (we must assume) ahead, it begins to seem as if we are wholly dependent on children to provide the world with whatever minimum fuel of promise is required for it to keep turning. The kids have no choice in the matter. They cannot be any other place or any other age. They can only be resilient, miraculously so. Where does this capability come from? Are children able to recover so quickly from adversity because of their inexperience, because they don\u2019t realize quite how bad things really are? Or is it because they have a greater capacity than adults to live entirely in the present, to lose themselves in a game of soccer or tag? Or perhaps resilience is a concept supplied by adults, who would like to believe that children will overcome the terrible experiences we foist upon them. Much of the research suggests that kids who encounter repeated or sustained trauma and overwhelming stress are likely to suffer outcomes that range from debilitating depression and post-traumatic stress disorder to heart disease and diabetes. Though these children may furnish their ruined cities and shattered families with a little hope, they won\u2019t emerge unscathed.\nIn our current crisis, nearly 30 million children worldwide have been driven from their homes by war and persecution. Media coverage has lately focused on the Syrian dimension of this tragedy (in part because of the fate of one refugee child, Aylan Kurdi, the Syrian toddler who drowned crossing the Mediterranean in September). But these 30 million girls and boys are from all over \u2014 Afghanistan, Iraq, Eritrea, Libya, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Myanmar, Bangladesh. This week\u2019s issue of the magazine has been built around portraits of three of them: an 11-year-old boy from eastern Ukraine named Oleg, a 12-year-old Syrian girl named Hana and a 9-year-old South Sudanese boy named Chuol. All three have seen their homes destroyed; two have lost family members. Yet they carry on. Their stories are told in a multimedia documentary project, comprising a feature story, interviews, three photo essays and, for the first time in the history of The New York Times, a virtual-reality film.\nWe decided to launch The Times\u2019s virtual-reality efforts with these portraits because we recognize that this new filmmaking technology enables an uncanny feeling of connection with people whose lives are far from our own. By creating a 360-degree environment that encircles the viewer, virtual reality creates the experience of being present within distant worlds, making it uniquely suited to projects, like this one, that speak to our senses of empathy and community. What better use of the technology could there be than to place our readers within a crisis that calls to us daily with great urgency and yet, because of the incessancy of the call, often fails to rouse us at all?\nOleg, Hana and Chuol account for the tiniest fraction of a percentage of those 30 million children, but their experiences stand in for the whole. In Hana\u2019s story, we see the daily trials of a refugee who now lives in a foreign country and is trying to make a provisional life; in Oleg\u2019s, we see the difficulties of building a new life amid the ruins of the old. Chuol\u2019s story is more grave. He is in the midst of a terrifying escape, unsure of where or when a new life might begin. As dissimilar as these three children are, they\u2019re bound in an unhappy fellowship, not only with one another but also with the other displaced kids around the world, with the two children in the photos on my desk and with the numberless children displaced throughout history by all the world\u2019s wars. Think of them, moving silently within the mass migrations and terrified departures, the families running away at night, the human displacements on an unfathomable scale. Aztec children fleeing the armored conquistadors. French Huguenot children crossing the English Channel with their parents. European children streaming east and west and north and south during the First and Second World Wars. Jewish children resettling all over the world. Vietnamese children leaping into boats. Liberian children riding on their parents\u2019 shoulders down roads lined by bodies. Iraqi children running from the gigantic explosions of the gulf war. Generations of Haitian children. Generations of Palestinian children. Generations of Afghan children. See them struggling along, year after year after year, carrying the burden of ensuring our future upon their small backs.",

He had just turned 22 \u2014 the product of British private schools, a computer aficionado working in customer service at Sky News \u2014 when he decided to turn his dream into reality.\nIn May 2013, Ifthekar Jaman left his comfortable home in Portsmouth, England, explaining to his parents, who emigrated years earlier from Bangladesh, that he wanted to learn Arabic in the Middle East. Instead, he booked a one-way ticket to Turkey. The next time his parents, Enu and Hena, heard from him, he had crossed the Turkish border into Syria and joined the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham \u2014 also known as ISIS or ISIL \u2014 the most brutal, and now the most powerful, of a dozen or so militant Sunni Islamist groups arrayed against President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and his equally brutal Alawite government.\nIfthekar was part of the first wave of foreign fighters, whose motives were primarily humanitarian. Everyone \u2014 not just Muslims \u2014 was outraged by the atrocities of the Assad regime. Both the U.S. and the British governments were calling for Assad to step down. So were France, and Turkey, and a number of nations in the Middle East.\nThe foreign fighters were arriving by the hundreds to join one of the various rebel groups challenging Assad\u2019s military-backed dictatorship. Many were as na\u00efve and inexperienced as Ifthekar was. Some recruits were fervent believers; others showed scant knowledge of Islam. Ifthekar was pious, though not doctrinaire. He embraced his Bengali traditions, but he appeared well integrated into British life and was popular among his classmates and his non-Muslim friends. As a boy, he spent hours immersed in the tales of \u201cHarry Potter\u201d and \u201cThe Lord of the Rings.\u201d As a teenager, he played the guitar and was a member of the Portsmouth Dawah Team, which, on weekends, distributed free copies of the Quran. He had a cat, Bilai, that he adored and that, on occasion, would follow him to dawn prayers at the Portsmouth Jami mosque.\nDressed, as he\u2019d planned, all in black, a long, Salafist beard framing his face, a black prayer cap on his head, Ifthekar set out for Syria alone \u2014 there were no established routes or support networks then, as there are now \u2014 following the dusty road from the Turkish border town Reyhanli to the Bab al-Hawa crossing into Syria. He was intent on joining Jabhat al-Nusra, Al Qaeda\u2019s Syrian branch, which was the pre-eminent Islamist group in the early stages of the anti-Assad campaign. The only problem was, he didn\u2019t know how.\nA chance encounter with a bearded man would provide the key: As he boarded a bus near the Turkish border, Ifthekar, still lacking any plan, quickly scanned the faces of his companions. \u201cTurkey is a pretty secular country,\u201d he would later explain, \u201cand I only spotted one man with a beard.\u201d Ifthekar approached the man and, as the bus careered down the road, offered him a small bottle of attar, an alcohol-free musk oil popular with Muslims. The two began to talk. The bearded man, a Syrian from Aleppo, asked Ifthekar if he was en route to Syria to do jihad. Ifthekar responded that he was. When the bus stopped on the other side of the border, the bearded man drove him, in his waiting car, to the recruitment office of Jabhat \u2014 also known as the Nusra Front.\nIfthekar was devastated when the group turned him down. He didn\u2019t have the required letters of recommendation.\n\u201cI got teary,\u201d he later recalled. \u201cThis is what I\u2019d come for!\u201d He pleaded with the Tunisian jihadist manning the recruitment desk, even offering to be held prisoner by the Nusra Front while it did a background check on him. It was all to no avail. Finally the Tunisian offered to help him join another Islamist group, Ahrar al-Sham. Ifthekar refused. He knew that Ahrar permitted smoking, of which he most strenuously disapproved.\nAnd so it was that Ifthekar, after being vetted for a fortnight by the group, joined ISIS.\nHis major complaint \u2014 which echoed the complaints of many of the foreigners who had come to these battlefields \u2014 was that of boredom. Weeks turned into months, and he and many of his fellow fighters had yet to wage jihad. Many manned roadblocks or checkpoints; others performed menial tasks. Ifthekar, whose father owned a takeout restaurant, had traveled to Syria, at considerable risk, to be drafted as a chef.\nThen, in December 2013, seven months after he arrived, Ifthekar was finally sent into battle in the eastern province of Deir Ezzor.\nHe was killed almost immediately.\nIfthekar\u2019s story would become an iconic one of the foreign jihad in Syria. It was recounted to me by Shiraz Maher, a senior research fellow at the International Center for the Study of Radicalization (I.C.S.R.), an innovative institute at King\u2019s College London. Here, a handful of researchers have been charting, following and, in some cases, interacting directly with foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq \u2014 through text-messaging and smartphone apps \u2014 in hopes of understanding their motivations and their worldview. The center now monitors some 700 of the 20,000 foreign fighters from 90 countries around the world. (Foreigners make up half of ISIS\u2019s total fighting force.) An estimated 4,000 are from Western nations, some 600 to 700 from Britain alone. More British Muslim men have joined ISIS and the Nusra Front than are serving in the British armed forces.\nMany of the fighters from Britain \u2014 as well as those from Finland, Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands \u2014 came from comfortable middle-class homes. Many were university students or graduates; a surprising number were women, too. But they didn\u2019t appear to fit a typical profile, which confounded counterterrorism experts and Western governments. Some, like Ifthekar, seemed driven by romantic notions of jihad. Others, like Mohammed Emwazi, who later became known as Jihadi John, the ruthless executioner of Western journalists and aid workers in the ISIS videos, fully embraced the violence of the Islamic State. Emwazi was also a Briton, and also the son of a comfortable middle-class family, with a degree in computer programming. And then there were still other cases in which entire families made their way to Syria or Iraq: pregnant women; young children; even the family pets.\nThe I.C.S.R. forms part of the Department of War Studies at Kings College\u2019s Strand Campus. Peter Neumann, a 40-year-old political scientist and a professor of security studies, established the center in January 2008 to study the roots of radicalization and political violence. Now, as its director, he supervises a surprisingly small staff, considering the depth and range of the research the center does. There are only nine full-time academics attached to it, supplemented by a dozen or so part-time interns or students who sit hunched over their laptops in shifts, tracking the militant Islamists in the center\u2019s database.\nInitially, researchers monitored jihadist websites and individual Twitter accounts. But it was not until 2013 that they established direct contact with the foreign fighters themselves. \u201cIt was exhilarating,\u201d Maher said to me, \u201cand we came about it only by chance.\u201d Maher happened upon Ifthekar, who used his Twitter feed to recount his experiences in Syria and to urge all of his \u201cbrothers and sisters\u201d to come and join the fight. Soon, I.C.S.R. researchers realized there were other Europeans in Syria: a Dane named Abu Fulan; then a former Dutch soldier called Yilmaz. They sent a flood of messages, hoping some of the fighters would respond. Ifthekar was the first; he invited Maher to talk on Skype. As the researchers gained the fighters\u2019 trust, direct contact increased. Most of the jihadists preferred text-messaging, for both convenience and security. Some of them were effusive; others were guarded and skeptical; still others, over a period of time, actually began to seek, or offer, guidance and advice.\n\u201cBuilding these relationships with these guys, you get to know them,\u201d Maher told me. \u201cYou build and develop rapport. You get to understand why they\u2019re there; what they hope to do. One Eid, the first message I got was not from my parents, but from a member of Al Qaeda. It was surreal.\u201d\nMaher, a 33-year-old historian of medium height and medium build with a neatly trimmed beard, is an expert on Salafi jihadism. As I sat with him one February morning, he scrolled through dozens of images culled from Facebook and jihadist websites that he\u2019d stored on his laptop: young men in battle gear, some posing with weapons, others manning roadblocks; still others lounging by swimming pools and extolling the virtues of what the foreign fighters have coined \u201cthe five-star jihad.\u201d\nAs we looked at the images, Maher began recounting some of the fighters\u2019 stories to me. Some of the jihadists were hardened radicals who would become suicide bombers in Syria or Iraq. Others, he discovered, were much more fanciful. There was, for example, the foreign fighter from Mexico who constantly complained that it was impossible to find good Mexican food in Syria. There was the blind man from the Netherlands, who told a recruiter that because he was blind he couldn\u2019t fight; the recruiter told him to come anyhow: \u201cWe\u2019re a state,\u201d he said, \u201cand we need people to build that state.\u201d And then there was the young man from Britain, who was already packed but had one last question before he left: Was hair gel available in Syria?\nI looked around at the various flags that festoon the I.C.S.R.\u2019s walls. They told the story of the three generations of Western fighters who had embraced jihad \u2014 going back to the 1980s and the war in Afghanistan. There were banners of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the Free Syrian Army and ISIS, interspersed with posters of angry young men, some holding Kalashnikovs, others staring sternly ahead. The black, white and green flag of the U.S.-trained Free Syrian Army, Maher told me, took forever to find; he finally came upon one in a Turkish border town on the Syrian frontier. The black-and-white banner of ISIS, conversely, was available everywhere.\nMaher explained that Ifthekar\u2019s experience with the Nusra Front was not atypical. \u201cAl Nusra has a vigorous vetting process, especially for foreigners,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s called tazkiyah, and it means that you must be vouched for by someone already in the organization. The system has worked well for Arabs with links to the group, but it has made it much more difficult for Europeans to join.\u201d\nThe group also expects recruits to speak Arabic. \u201cNusra is very big on being entrenched in local communities,\u201d Neumann told me. \u201cIf they think you\u2019re not going to be useful, they won\u2019t take you in. ISIS is less discriminating. They say: \u2018If you\u2019re a Muslim, you\u2019re already part of the Caliphate. So even if you\u2019re too fat, or too old to be a fighter, we\u2019ll find something else for you to do. You have a right to emigrate. We\u2019ll find a place for you.\u201d\nOf the 600 to 700 British fighters now in Syria and Iraq, only 20 percent have gone to the Nusra Front, according to Neumann. \u201cThe remaining 80 percent,\u201d he says, \u201chave joined ISIS. Very, very few are joining other groups.\u201d\nHours at the I.C.S.R. can be erratic: Exchanges always occur on the jihadists\u2019 clock. Maher and the other academics often have to wait, sometimes seemingly endlessly, for the fighters to call. In conducting research into radicalization, its causes and effects, and how it might be reversed, the center has published scores of research papers, journal articles and monographs. In some cases, it has acted as a kind of news service for those on the battlefields. It was the first to announce the death of one young British man.\nI asked Maher if, based on the center\u2019s research, he could draw a typical jihadist profile. \u201cThe average British fighter is male, in his early 20s and of South Asian ethnic origin,\u201d he began. \u201cHe usually has some university education and some association with activist groups. Over and over again, we have seen that radicalization is not necessarily driven by social deprivation or poverty.\u201d He paused for a moment, and then went on. \u201cOther than those who go for humanitarian reasons, some of the foreign fighters are students of martyrdom; they want to die as soon as possible and go directly to paradise. We\u2019ve seen four British suicide bombers thus far among the 38 Britons who have been killed. Then there are the adventure seekers \u2014 those who think this will enhance their masculinity, the gang members and the petty criminals too; and then, of course, the die-hard radicals, who began by burning the American flag and who then advanced to wanting to kill Americans \u2014 or their partners \u2014 under any circumstance.\u201d\nOne afternoon I was talking with Maher in his office, which is filled with books and files, when an intern came in and handed him a note. He immediately turned to his computer and began to navigate onto jihadist websites, until he found what he was looking for: a video clip showing First Lt. Moaz al-Kasasbeh, the Jordanian fighter pilot, as ISIS was about to burn him alive.\nWe both sat stunned as the video began to play. Lieutenant Kasasbeh had been a prisoner of ISIS since Dec. 24, when his F-16 fighter plane was supposedly shot down, not far from the ISIS capital of Raqaa in northern Syria. He was the first member of the U.S.-led coalition to be captured by the Islamic State. Now dressed in an orange uniform \u2014 to resemble the attire of prisoners in Guant\u00e1namo \u2014 he stood inside a locked cage in the middle of the desert. A dozen or so ISIS fighters, some wearing masks, others not, formed a semicircle at a safe distance from the cage. The footage began cutting back and forth, between the desert scene and images of the charred bodies of women and children, their flesh discolored and raw, who, according to a voice-over, had been the victims of the coalition bombing campaign against ISIS in Syria.\nThe camera zoomed in and out, focusing on tight head shots of Kasasbeh, his bright orange uniform in sharp contrast with the taupe of the desert and the black ISIS flags. Then, with a flourish of his hand, one fighter set a powder fuse alight. The flames raced across the sand to Kasasbeh\u2019s cage. The fighters began swaying rhythmically back and forth to the background music of a prophetic lyric, or nasheed. Kasasbeh flailed his arms as the flames entered his cage, first setting the bottom of his uniform alight, then moving on until the 26-year-old pilot disappeared in a human fireball.\nLater, I asked Maher if such an act would dissuade potential fighters from joining the Islamic State. He replied that it would not. \u201cIn their minds, this was qisas, the principle of equal retaliation under Islamic law. If someone is killed, you can kill the perpetrator. You can choose the means. And he was burned at one of the very sites that the coalition forces bombed. Something like this will not affect the average fighter I\u2019m talking to. For them, they are in a state of war with us. The Caliphate must be protected at all costs.\u201d\nWhether or not the Caliphate that ISIS has declared proves viable, it has extraordinary appeal, a return to the grandeur of the seventh- century Islamic state. ISIS now controls one-third of Syria and nearly one-third of Iraq. And as its territory has expanded, its volume of resources\u00ad (oil, gas, electricity from captured dams and millions of dollars paid for hostages) has become unmatched \u2014 one primary reason that thousands of foreign fighters have abandoned other jihadist groups, including the Nusra Front, in order to join the ISIS fight. According to one U.S. intelligence official, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak on the subject, an estimated 1,000 foreign fighters are joining ISIS every month. Even as ISIS shocks the world with its public beheadings and its demolition of priceless archaeological sites, its ranks continue to expand, from Boko Haram in sub-Saharan Africa, to Libya, Tunisia, Egypt and Afghanistan. In many Middle Eastern countries, a new generation of jihadists came of age in the aftermath of the Arab Spring, when earlier exhilaration gave way to dashed hopes, and the return of even more brutal authoritarian states.\nFrom its hundreds of online platforms \u2014 and at least 46,000 Twitter accounts, according to a new report by J.M. Berger of the Brookings Institution \u2014 ISIS recruits from multiple spheres, not only foreign fighters but also doctors and nurses and technocrats, schoolteachers and accountants. And women as well, to marry fighters and populate the state. (British women make up some 20 percent of the 550 Western women who have joined Islamist groups in Syria and Iraq.) In late February, when three young British girls \u2014 two of whom were only 15 \u2014 clandestinely traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State, concern in London gave way to alarm not only because they were straight-A students but also because their recruiter was a woman, a Briton too, known as Umm Layth (or Mother of the Lion), who had become a den mother for scores of disaffected, or bored, or angry, or frustrated young British girls.\nI puzzled over why the flow of young British men, and women, into ISIS-controlled territory continued to grow. And I asked Maher now if Muslims were less integrated than the seemingly assimilated lives of Ifthekar and Jihadi John, for example, would suggest.\n\u201cWe are one of the best integrated countries in Europe,\u201d Maher said. \u201cWe have high-level Muslims in politics, including cabinet ministers; among opinion makers and journalists. Unfortunately, in the mid-to-late 1980s and the 1990s, we took in a number of dissidents, a new wave of Muslim preachers, who integrated into the heart of British Muslim life. They spoke Arabic, wore fancy robes and came from the Middle East. They were the ones who opened the debate in the mosques on \u2018What is the Caliphate? What role does, or should it play, in everyday Muslim life?\u2019 A lot of young people who go to Syria today were infants when the debate began, so this is what they\u2019ve grown up with; it was the mood music of their lives. And today, ISIS and other recruiters have fed into this. Their message is: It\u2019s better to be a Muslim in Raqaa than living next door to a Christian neighbor in London. And this is something with which an aspiring jihadist can connect.\u201d\n\u201cIs that what convinced you?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cNo.\u201d He smiled.\nFor four years, Maher was a member of Hizb ut-Tahrir, a radical Islamist group that he describes as an intellectual movement, not violent per se, but the political wing of the global jihadist movement worldwide.\nRaised in Saudi Arabia, where his British-Pakistani parents had moved so that his father could set up an accounting practice there, Maher lived, as most Westerners do, in a walled compound, with swimming pools and tennis courts, cut off, in effect, from the desert kingdom surrounding them. Politics was never spoken of.\nThen one day when he was 11, and wearing a Daffy Duck T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan \u201cI Support Operation Desert Storm,\u201d someone he now described to me as \u201can ordinary Saudi,\u201d challenged him. \u201cHe asked me why I flaunted such a slogan on my T-shirt,\u201d Maher told me. \u201c\u2009\u2018Why not?\u2019 I replied; \u2018Saddam is a terrible man.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 the Saudi replied. \u2018The Americans use this as an excuse to establish bases on holy soil.\u2019\u2009\u201d It was Maher\u2019s first encounter with anti-Western Islamist thought.\nNot long after returning to Britain, he enrolled at the University of Leeds. \u201cI was rootless and would have described myself as an agnostic or atheist,\u201d he told me now. \u201cThen Sept. 11 happened, and I said to myself: \u2018You Americans, if you play with fire, you\u2019ll get burnt. You\u2019ve meddled in the Arab world. You\u2019ve supported Israel. You should reap what you have sown \u2014 I thought to myself: America is the strongest power in the world, yet 19 guys got in and wreaked havoc. I was 21 at the time, and I thought, We\u2019re on the cusp of history; we\u2019re going to reshape the world.\u201d\nWithin days, he had stopped drinking; left his girlfriend; and joined Hizb ut-Tahrir, quickly advancing in its ranks to become the group\u2019s director for the northeast of Britain. Then in July 2005, the London Underground was bombed, and just as his own jihadist trajectory was born in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, it came to an end that day. He had already begun having doubts about Tahrir and what he considered to be its simplified, absolutist version of Islam. He was, by now, a graduate student at Cambridge, where the Islamist debate was more pluralistic and nuanced.\n\u201cIf I had been 30 years older, I probably would have become a Communist,\u201d Maher went on. \u201cAnd even now, when I meet some of my friends who also used to be in Tahrir, we all agree that, yes, if we were 10 years younger, we\u2019d probably be off fighting in Syria or Iraq. Can you imagine, a 20-year-old kid whose peers are getting drunk, obsessed with finding a girlfriend, as opposed to doing something in Syria or Iraq that, within an hour, gets a response from the president of the United States? Obama doesn\u2019t know what a 25-year-old manager at Primark does, but if he goes to Syria and becomes involved with the Islamic State, he goes from being the manager of a second-rate clothing store to someone giving headaches to the president of the United States.\u201d\nWhile I was in London, the question of re-entry \u2014 and possible rehabilitation of British foreign fighters \u2014 was being debated, often vigorously, in the halls of Parliament, in universities and the press and among human rights groups. The government was putting the final touches on a new counterterrorism and security bill \u2014 which would become law on Feb. 12 \u2014 one of a number of measures designed to stanch the flow of British fighters abroad and, as important, to define how to deal with them if they return home. The tension in Parliament was palpable. The bill was passed in the wake of three horrific events: the terrorist attack in Paris against the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, which left 12 dead, and two other related attacks, in which five others were killed; the discovery that Jihadi John was, in fact, a Briton; and the incineration of the Jordanian pilot, al-Kasasbeh.\nAs the debate continued, I asked Peter Neumann what he thought. Keeping tabs on returned fighters is not part of the I.C.S.R.\u2019s mission, he said. The jihadists with whom the center corresponds often simply disappear \u2014 they may have died or been taken prisoner or even switched allegiances \u2014 and the center is wary of implicating itself or any of its contacts by tracking whether fighters return home.\nWhen I asked him whether the fighters returning to Britain posed a real threat, he replied that a small percentage of them did. \u201cAccording to a recent study, based on foreign fighters who had gone off to fight in previous conflicts, one in nine ended up being involved in terrorist activities when they returned home,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the good news is we\u2019re talking about just over 10 percent. But a number of other studies have also shown that when foreign fighters are involved in terrorist attacks, the attacks are larger, and more dangerous.\u201d He paused for a moment, and then he said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether they will act today or tomorrow, but what we do know is that in five, 10, 15 years, not just next month, they will pose a danger. They\u2019ve had military training; they\u2019ve set up networks. We\u2019ve seen it with the Afghan Arabs\u201d \u2014 those foreign fighters who came of age in the decade-long, C.I.A.-financed jihad of the 1980s against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. \u201cMany of them subsequently became involved in every conflict of the 1990s: Bosnia, Kosovo, Chechnya. Others went home to Libya, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and, once there, like the other Afghan Arabs, they became the elite: the leadership of the new jihad.\u201d\nTwenty-six years have passed since the C.I.A. closed down its pipeline to the Afghan mujahedeen, leaving behind some 25,000 well-trained and well-armed foreign fighters from nearly 30 countries, the first generation of today\u2019s jihad. Today\u2019s pool of fighters is even greater.\n\u201cThe numbers of this generation are astonishing,\u201d says Richard Barrett, a former head of counterterrorism for MI6 and now a senior vice president of the Soufan Group in New York \u2014 which, among other things, provides strategic security and intelligence services to multinational organizations and government. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about some 20,000 fighters from about 90 countries around the world \u2014 which could be three times more nationalities from which today\u2019s fighters are being drawn. And although the number of fighters is fairly comparable, those who went to Afghanistan arrived over a period of 10 years; in Iraq and Syria, it\u2019s been only three, four years.\u201d He went on: \u201cThere\u2019s also more of a common purpose today and thus more camaraderie. A great majority of today\u2019s fighters are fighting for the Ummah \u2014 the community of Muslims \u2014 which they see as being under threat. With Afghanistan, the battle was against the Soviets, which was much more opaque. Also, and this is very important, in the case of Afghanistan, many of the jihadists were being sent by their governments; it was state sponsorship. Today we are seeing 20,000 young men from around the world \u2014 aided by social media, to a great extent \u2014 simply packing their bags and taking the initiative.\u201d\nThe counterterrorism bill was being harshly criticized by human rights groups for, among other things: the power to temporarily ban re-entry to the country, for two years, of any British citizen suspected of fighting in Syria or Iraq; to empower airport security officials and border guards to confiscate the passports of any suspected would-be jihadists before they set off; and to require Internet-service providers to retain communications data from private accounts. The government defended its position on national-security grounds. \u201cOne of our major problems here is that, until now, we have had no significant border checks for exiting the U.K.,\u201d a member of Parliament, who was not authorized to speak on the subject and so asked not to be named, explained. \u201cAs a result, we have no idea where someone has been when he or she comes back. As far as the exclusion provision is concerned, anyone who is not permitted to re-enter the country has the right to appeal, and that appeal must be granted, as long as that person agrees to an interview with a member of the security services. The point of this section is to stop individuals suspected of terrorism from coming back without making their return clear and obvious to the government.\u201d\nI asked Barrett what he thought of the bill\u2019s provisions. He replied: \u201cThis bill was driven by two factors: the government\u2019s responsibility to protect the state, of course, but also domestic opinion and, as part of that, commensurate pressure on the government. This is the government\u2019s way of saying: \u2018We\u2019re tough on terrorism.\u2019 But a negative in all of this was the government\u2019s speed in drafting the bill, with elections coming up.\u201d What he had hoped the bill would do, he said, was to establish ways of reintegrating those who had gone to Syria or Iraq. \u201cBefore this bill was passed, according to official figures, 260 Britons had already returned, and only 40 or so were arrested, and may be brought to trial. So we\u2019re talking about some 220 people who came back and got on with their lives. Now, with this new legislation, if someone really wants to come back because he\u2019s disenchanted with all the infighting, with all that he\u2019s seen, what\u2019s going to happen to him? This is not something you can legislate with a blanket approach. What do you do? Tell this young man, You\u2019re going to have to stay there for two more years, and thus become even more radicalized?\u201d\nHe paused and then said: \u201cAnother thing which is terribly important is how to stop the flow; how to dissuade young men \u2014 and some women, too \u2014 from going out at all. And who is better to do this than those who have returned? Let them tell potential recruits: \u2018It\u2019s terrible! Don\u2019t go!\u2019 If you want to send a message, you\u2019ve got to choose who that messenger will be. If you want to get credible messengers, you\u2019ve got to find people with credibility.\u201d\nAldgate East is the last stop on the District line before London proper ends. It is a welter of shops and coffeehouses and traffic jams; noise and people are everywhere. It used to be a largely Jewish neighborhood, and then in the 1970s and 1980s, waves of Bengalis, from the Indian subcontinent, arrived, and the neighborhood was transformed. It is now home to the largest mosque in Britain, the East London Mosque, a massive, sprawling structure set somewhat incongruously next to \u2014 and surrounding three sides of \u2014 the tiny Fieldgate synagogue.\nI had come here to meet Moazzam Begg, an Islamic activist, a prolific writer and speaker and a former prisoner at Guant\u00e1namo Bay who, along with 15 other Britons who were also detainees, sued the British government for complicity in their detention, successfully. More recently, Begg, who now works with a human rights and advocacy group, had traveled twice to Syria since the carnage there began.\nAs I went in search of his office, I promptly became lost. I wandered around for perhaps 15 minutes or so, well away from the neighborhood\u2019s bustling thoroughfare, down quiet cul-de-sacs and labyrinthine passageways. I realized almost immediately that I was the only woman not wearing a hijab, or head scarf, or a full veil. I felt more self-conscious in appearance here, in East London, than in Peshawar, Pakistan. I couldn\u2019t help wondering, yet again, about the degree of assimilation, and integration, of Muslims here.\nThe Cage offices are in an unpretentious building on a quiet street not far from the mosque. I met Begg in an open alcove area that abuts the main reception hall. Beyond it, five or six young men and women worked at computer screens; others checked reference books and files.\nBegg, the son of a professional, middle-class family \u2014 his father, a former bank manager, writes Urdu poetry \u2014 is a product of the Jewish King David School, where he wore a blue blazer affixed with the Star of David; the Lynx Gang of Birmingham, which consisted mostly of South Asian youth; and the University of Wolverhampton, where he studied law. He is short in stature, with dark, intense eyes and a graying beard, premature perhaps, for someone only 47, but possibly a result of the nearly three years he spent, often in solitary confinement, first at the U.S. detention center in Bagram, Afghanistan, and then, as an \u201cenemy combatant\u201d in Guant\u00e1namo. He was never charged or tried \u2014 as nearly none of those in Guant\u00e1namo have ever been \u2014 and was released by President George W. Bush in January 2005, as a favor to a friend, the British prime minister Tony Blair, who was then facing harsh criticism at home for his support of the Iraq War.\nIn 2006, Begg joined Cage Prisoners, which campaigns for the release of those remaining in Guant\u00e1namo and, as important, seeks countries to which they could be sent. (The organization\u2019s mandate has since expanded to include a campaign against the \u201cwar on terror\u201d and is now called Cage.) As the group\u2019s outreach director, Begg traveled across Europe, into the Middle East and on to Asia, addressing the European Parliament; winning praise from the American ambassador to Luxembourg and human rights groups. He became a minor celebrity in Britain; a much-sought-after media star; and, to the delight of liberals, the personification of the Bush administration\u2019s worst nightmare.\nCage, however, is not without its critics. In late February, it provoked uproar when its research director, Asim Qureshi, who had been in contact with Mohammed Emwazi before he became Jihadi John, suggested that MI5\u2019s earlier harassment of him may have contributed to his radicalization. London\u2019s mayor, Boris Johnson, called the accusations \u201cincredible.\u201d And Lord Carlile, a former independent reviewer of terror legislation for the government, said: \u201cAt the very least, Cage are guilty of sloppy thinking and very unwise language.\u201d\nI first heard Begg speak the month before, on a panel at London\u2019s Frontline Club, discussing the fate of British fighters who had gone off to Syria and Iraq, and what should happen to them when they came home. Now, as we sat in his office, I began by asking Begg what his most vivid memory of his three years in Bagram and Guant\u00e1namo was. \u201cIt was a long time ago,\u201d he replied, \u201cbut one of the things that keeps coming back are the American threats at Bagram, that if I didn\u2019t cooperate in their interrogations, I\u2019d be put in a wooden box like Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi was \u2014 and that I\u2019d be shipped to Egypt or Syria to be interrogated there.\u201d (Al-Libi, a key Al Qaeda trainer at Afghanistan\u2019s Al Khaldan camp, was renditioned to Egypt and, after what a Senate intelligence report describes as severe and prolonged torture, claimed, falsely, that there was a link between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime, which was a key component of the Bush administration\u2019s justification for its March 2003 invasion of Iraq.)\n\u201cThe threats were my introduction to the U.S. rendition program, and the black sites,\u201d Begg went on, \u201cand this is something I\u2019ve spent a lot of time investigating since.\u201d It was during a trip to Libya in 2011, to find out what happened to Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, Begg said, that he met the people who would encourage him to make his first trip to Syria the following year. \u201cWe were interested in two specific cases of U.S. prisoners who had been renditioned there,\u201d he told me now. \u201cOne of the things I discovered in the process was just how close the cooperation was between the Bush administration and the Assad regime, with the complicity of the British government.\u201d Then he said, \u201cNow, looking back, three years later, many of those who had been renditioned, or sent to black sites by the United States, are rebel leaders in Syria today.\u201d\nBegg returned to Syria in 2012 for a second trip, to continue his work on U.S. renditions there, but only after a meeting with officials from MI5, at their request. \u201cI told them in advance,\u201d Begg said to me, \u201cthat I would not discuss what I had seen or learned about British involvement in the renditions. They agreed and we met, with lawyers on both sides. MI5 gave me the green light to go.\u201d\nA little more than a year later, in February 2014, without warning, Begg was arrested and charged with seven counts under the terrorism act. He was sent to Belmarsh Prison, where he remained for nearly eight months. Then, just as abruptly as he was arrested, he was released, and all charges were dropped, after what the BBC described as \u201cnew material\u201d emerged. In a terse statement, the Crown Prosecution Service announced: \u201cIf we had been made aware of all this information at the time of charging, we would not have charged.\u201d It was rather like the N.Y.P.D. arresting someone for a trip sanctioned by the F.B.I.\n\u201cAmong the things I was charged with was sending a generator to a Syrian rebel \u2014 at the same time the British government was supplying generators to Syrian rebels,\u201d Begg told me now. \u201cObviously, I was happy to be released, but I wanted my day in court. I knew that I would never be convicted. The government\u2019s evidence was going to be my strongest defense. They know my views on what\u2019s happening in Syria. They\u2019d bugged my car for the last year and a half.\u201d\nGiven that Begg had been in Syria fairly recently, and had also met some of the jihadists who left Britain to fight there, I asked him if, in his view, they posed a threat to Britain, if they decided to come home.\n\u201cWhen I was being held at Belmarsh,\u201d he replied, \u201cI was held with several young men, who had returned from Syria and were arrested and being prosecuted under the terrorism act. Their age didn\u2019t exceed 22; most were in their late teens. Some of them had been held since September, October 2013. Prior to then, people had been coming and going to Syria, as they had done in Libya, without fear of being prosecuted when they came home. I know many men who fought in Libya against Qaddafi\u2019s regime and then went on to fight in Syria against Assad. But Libya was the \u2018good war,\u2019 and they were treated like heroes then. So why, in Syria, are they being treated like terrorists? Short of having been with ISIS, what crimes did they commit? To punish them \u2014 to take away their youth? Let them talk about their experiences. Let us learn from them. The only threat they posed was to the Assad regime.\n\u201cAnd let us be involved as well, those of us who have been to Syria and have seen what\u2019s happening on the ground. Let us be part of the reintegration process when they come home.\u201d He paused, and shook his head. \u201cThere was one young man in Belmarsh, he was 19 years old, and he was sentenced to 13 years. He had not been fighting with ISIS. Indeed, ISIS was the reason he left.\u201d\nA stream of people came and went from Begg\u2019s office as we continued to talk.\nI asked Begg why, in his view, ISIS had such appeal for the hundreds of Britons who had gone off to fight with it.\n\u201cIn a word, legitimacy,\u201d he replied. He, too, cited the territory ISIS had seized, the declaration of a Caliphate, the sense that they alone were fighting the enemy, which was not just Assad and the West but the corrupt regimes of the Middle East. \u201cAs much as I oppose ISIS,\u201d Begg went on, \u201cI recognize that these arguments are very powerful, but I believe the arguments against ISIS are more powerful. One of their biggest drawbacks is that they have no grounding\u201d \u2014 in Islam \u2014 \u201cno knowledge; no experience. It\u2019s really quite bizarre. The old religious scholars \u2014 Sheikh Abu Qatada and Sheikh Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, for example \u2014 the religious authorities to whom those who became ISIS deferred in the past, now they are simply ignored. Their advice is not taken. When they\u2019ve tried to mediate the release of hostages, for example, they\u2019ve been rebuffed. So now, like much of the religious establishment, they\u2019ve unanimously rejected ISIS and condemned it for many of its acts.\u201d\nHe then pointed to the fact that ISIS, unlike the Nusra Front and other Islamist groups, had antagonized local populations with its harsh punishments. \u201cThe people I lived with in Syria, and to whom I became close, have recently been arrested by ISIS, and the head of the household was executed for refusing to pledge allegiance to the group.\u201d\nHe paused for a moment and then went on: \u201cI keep thinking of the young men in Belmarsh, and what will happen to them. This new counterterrorism bill should not be passed. Britain already has more antiterrorism legislation now than we had during the time of the I.R.A. The home secretary says we are now facing the greatest terrorist threat in recent history. Has she forgotten the conflict with the I.R.A.? What about it? What about the 3,000 people who died then?\u201d\nWhile talking to Begg, I recognized a man who had entered the outer reception area and whom I had been trying to meet for two weeks. I\u2019d been told that three of his sons had gone to Syria to fight.\n\u201cIs that Abubaker Deghayes?\u201d I whispered to Begg across the table at which we sat.\nHe nodded.\nThirty-five years ago, Zohra Zewawi Deghayes, a young Libyan widow, whose husband, a prominent lawyer and human rights activist, was killed by Qaddafi\u2019s regime, began to make plans to smuggle her family, including Abubaker, then 11, and his younger brother, Omar, 10, out of Libya and into England, where the family spent summer holidays. Eventually she succeeded, and the family moved to Saltdean, outside Brighton, and into a large house by the sea, where Zohra Zewawi, now a British citizen, continues to live today.\nOmar, now 45, became a lawyer like his father, and after university, he moved to Afghanistan, where he helped to establish a school and worked with NGOs. Then came the American bombing campaign in October 2001, and Omar, with his family, fled to Pakistan, where he was arrested by Pakistani intelligence officers and turned over to the United States, which, he claims, was sending out bounty hunters to find any foreign men who had recently arrived from Afghanistan. Like Begg, he ended up in Guant\u00e1namo, where he spent more than five years, until the Americans realized their mistake: the man for whom they had been searching was not of Libyan descent after all but a Saudi who had served in Chechnya. After the intervention of the British government, Omar was released, but not, he claims, before one of his Guant\u00e1namo guards tried, with his fingers, to gouge out his right eye \u2014 an eye in which he remains blinded today.\nAbubaker, meanwhile, remained in Saltdean, where he became a property manager and a trustee at the Brighton mosque. His life was pleasant, if uneventful. Then, early last year, it fell apart. Three of his five sons, he told me now, as we sat in Begg\u2019s reception room, had gone to Syria and joined the Nusra Front. Two of them had been killed.\n\u201cAmer, the oldest, was the first to go to Syria,\u201d Abubaker said. \u201cHe was 19 when he left in 2013. He had become interested in world affairs about two years before, at the time of the Arab Spring. He never thought of going to Libya; he was more concerned with his career. He was studying finance and took his studies very seriously. But with Syria, he felt differently. I knew he was going to go, we discussed it a lot. I urged him to go with an aid convoy, which I had done a number of times myself; to work in the refugee camps; to do humanitarian work. I pleaded with him not to become a fighter. I thought he had agreed. But then I was told by a friend in one of the Turkish refugee camps that he had crossed into Syria and joined Jabhat.\u201d\nHe sat silently, staring ahead.\nA stout, bearded man, now 47, Abubaker has a zebibah, or prayer bump, on his forehead, the sign of a devout Muslim man. \u201cThen last February,\u201d he went on, \u201cI found out that Abdullah, my second son, and Jaffar, my fourth, were missing, and their passports were gone. I left for Turkey immediately, fearing the worst. Unlike Amer, they left without my knowledge, without discussing it at all. I found them in Reyhanli\u201d \u2014 the Turkish border town that is a base for Syrian refugees and a rallying point for fighters crossing into Syria.\n\u201cI had been to Reyhanli a number of times myself with aid convoys, and it was easy to find them. There are only two hotels. They were shocked to see me; I pleaded with them, to no avail. They were intent on joining Amer, and wouldn\u2019t come back with me.\u201d He paused for a moment, and then he said, \u201cAbdullah, who was 18, was killed in a couple of weeks. Amer and Jaffar were both with him when he died. Then, Jaffar, my next to youngest son, was killed in Idlib last October. He was only 16. Amer told me that he had been shot through his head. He survived for 15 minutes or so, just long enough, Amer said, to recite the final Muslim prayers.\u201d\nHis eyes misted over, and neither of us said anything more.\nJaffar Deghayes was one of the youngest British foreign fighters to die in Syria. He had not yet finished school, but he wanted to study finance one day, as his older brother Amer did, interrupted only by his own journey to Syria.\nAbubaker told me that he was increasingly worried about Amer, to whom he had spoken the previous morning, and who was torn: his fellow fighters were urging him to stay. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming harder and harder for Amer to pull himself out,\u201d Abubaker said. \u201cI keep telling him, I have faith in the fairness of the system here. But the fighters surrounding him there keep trying to dissuade him, telling him that dying as a martyr is better than living this life.\u201d\nHe paused and then went on, saying that he was also concerned about what would happen to Amer if he did come home. \u201cUnder this new legislation, you\u2019re guilty until you\u2019re proven innocent. Many Brits went to fight in the revolution against Qaddafi; many fought in Bosnia and, before that, in Afghanistan. They were the cream of the Afghan Arabs, and they came home. They never did anything against this country, and they\u2019re grandfathers now.\u201d\nAbubaker stood up to leave, but then turned to me and said: \u201cPlease tell Amer, if he reads your story, please tell him he must come home. And for any other young men, tell them now, please, tell them: Just don\u2019t go!\u201d",

    "text": "Can a Stock-Trader-Turned-Convict Start a New Life?\n2015-02-27T11:58:29.000Z\nOne day in the middle of 2008, Sakhawat Khan, a Silicon Valley chip engineer, walked into a small house near the back of his two-acre property that his wife, Roomy, a stock trader, used as a home office. Roomy and Sakhawat met when they were electrical-engineering students at Columbia University. After graduating, Sakhawat started inventing, eventually gathering some 30 semiconductor patents to his name. Roomy, who was more outgoing in social situations and more restless in her appetite for risk, was drawn to Wall Street and joined Galleon Group, a New York hedge fund run by the charismatic, bullish trader Raj Rajaratnam. In 1999, she struck out on her own to trade technology stocks. She thrived. Riding the Internet boom, she said, she had amassed a paper fortune of $50 million.\n\u201cI am not kidding when I say I had money,\u201d Roomy told me when I met her recently. \u201cI had a lot of money.\u201d In the late 1990s, the Khans moved out of their house in Sunnyvale, Calif., \u2014 Roomy called it a \u201ckhudd,\u201d a Punjabi word for \u201chole\u201d \u2014 and bought a 9,000-square-foot mansion in Atherton, the wealthiest town in Silicon Valley. They paid $10.5 million, all cash. The house had a pool, a tennis court and more than half a dozen marble fireplaces. They gave lavish parties for their friends and once, on a whim, spent $50,000 on wine.\nWhen Sakhawat visited Roomy in her office, her eyes were usually fixed on a large Bloomberg terminal, her ear pressed to the phone. But that morning when Sakhawat entered, he found his wife sitting at a large glass-topped table next to an open drawer containing a tape recorder and two phone jacks.\n\u201cWhat are you doing taping?\u201d Sakhawat asked.\n\u201cYou know my boss is not good with bonuses, so I want to track the information I give him,\u201d Roomy replied.\nThis was just one of the many lies she told. Since January 2008, as Roomy had ostensibly been going about her usual business \u2014 analyzing companies, gathering snippets of privileged corporate intelligence and deciding which stocks to buy and sell \u2014 she was secretly assisting the F.B.I. in a long-running investigation into insider trading at Wall Street hedge funds. Khan was the right woman for the job: Since about 2006, she herself had been trading on inside information. When the F.B.I. caught up with her, she began helping them \u2014 at first reluctantly and then with theatrical flair. She taped telephone calls with her bosses, business associates and even a neighbor. Most important of all, she taped calls with her ex-boss, Raj Rajaratnam, whom the government had been eyeing for a decade.\nOn the morning of Oct. 16, 2009, Wall Street awoke to images of Rajaratnam flanked by F.B.I. agents outside a federal courthouse, looking subdued and sour, with his hands cuffed behind his back. He had been charged by the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan with conspiracy and securities fraud.\nReading newspaper reports about the case, Sakhawat realized that the F.B.I. informant referred to as C.W. (cooperating witness) in the 34-page complaint against Rajaratnam had to be his wife. C.W.\u2019s recorded telephone calls with Rajaratnam suggested that he had access to inside information, enabling the government to obtain court permission to place a wiretap on his cellphone. It was the first time prosecutors had made significant use of wiretaps to investigate white-collar crime, and conversations intercepted from Rajaratnam\u2019s cellphone led the authorities to uncover the biggest insider-trading network in American history. (He is serving an 11-year sentence.)\nIt took only a few days for friends and associates of C.W.\u2019s many targets to unmask Khan. Within hours of the discovery, the press assailed her as \u201cThe Woman Who Ratted on Rajaratnam\u201d and \u201cThe Nark in Galleon Bust.\u201d In photographs, she was portrayed as disheveled and sinister. Incriminating episodes from her past were splashed across major newspapers. She and Sakhawat, it was revealed, had been sued by Deutsche Bank for failing to pay off a large promissory note (they later settled). A few years later, their housekeeper accused the Khans of violating labor laws by paying her $250 a week for 80 to 90 hours of work. They also settled a lawsuit with her after a judge said they had doctored evidence.\nThe gleeful bad-mouthing of Khan went on for years: Her flamboyance and her lying made for delectable reading, especially when it emerged that Khan had not been entirely truthful with the F.B.I. Even after she started cooperating, she manipulated them. Suspecting that Khan had been tipped off to the imminent takeover of Hilton Worldwide, investigators confronted her about shares she had purchased. Khan said she bought them because she thought the jailing of Paris Hilton would be good publicity for the brand. She also took out a cellphone contract in her gardener\u2019s name so she could continue speaking to some of her contacts. She claims she wanted to protect them from the government\u2019s prying; she also wanted to continue making legitimate money playing the markets.\nKhan\u2019s cooperation did not keep her out of jail. Sentencing her to a year at a women\u2019s prison in Coleman, Fla., near Orlando, Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the federal court in Manhattan admonished her: \u201cYou cannot have it both ways. You cannot obstruct justice and then say, \u2018Well, because I have done good things since, forget about it.\u2019\u2009\u201d Before going to jail, Khan spent her mornings walking along the beach, worrying about how she\u2019d survive in prison. But as she learned serving out her term: \u201cPrison is the easiest part. When you get out and there is nothing there \u2014 that is the toughest part.\u201d\nI met Khan in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in September, five months after she was released from prison and three months after she was transferred from a halfway house to her own home. I wanted to understand how a highly intelligent woman like Khan \u2014 she has a degree in engineering, two in physics and an M.B.A. from the University of California, Berkeley \u2014 wound up committing a crime like this. What sorts of calculations had she made to convince herself that the benefits of cheating outweighed the possible costs?\nKhan was wary of me. She felt bruised by the way the media had demonized her. All but one of her friends from her California days had abandoned her. Since moving to Florida, she has channeled her energies into raising her only child, her adopted daughter, Priyanka. \u201cI have no outside-world connections,\u201d she told me. Oddly, she was worried that if she agreed to be interviewed for an article, people might think she was paid for her story. (The New York Times does not pay for interviews.) After vetting the idea with her lawyer and her probation officer, she agreed to sit down and tell me about her life.\nI had seen so many unattractive photographs of Khan that I was surprised when a spunky woman with large, lively eyes and carefully blow-dried hair bounded up to me in my hotel lobby. Khan, who is about 5-foot-2 and svelte, was dressed in a loosefitting cotton blouse and skinny jeans and carried a horseshoe-shaped, fuchsia Louis Vuitton bag and an iPad on which she tracks a handful of stocks \u2014 Apple, Caterpillar and Cummins. She said she has no money to invest. \u201cI do it for the intellectual curiosity. Otherwise my mind would be mush.\u201d\nKhan is financially reliant on Sakhawat, who now has a business that manufactures tents in Bangladesh. He has remained loyal to Roomy, but she finds her dependence on him distressing. Khan told me that she hasn\u2019t let go of the sheer pleasure she derives from dropping thousands of dollars on fine things. She vowed she would go straight \u201cto a Louis Vuitton and blow $10,000\u201d if she ever found work. \u201cWhy? Because it makes me feel alive. I can\u2019t change my wiring.\u201d During my visit, she showed me a closet filled with some of her former trophies: designer handbags and shoes. She lovingly stroked a black leather Valentino handbag adorned with delicate lace flowers. \u201cValentino is my favorite brand,\u201d she said, as giddy as a teenage girl.\nKhan was born in 1958 into a traditional middle-class family. In January, I met her parents in Delhi, where Khan was raised. Her father, who has a Ph.D. in mathematics, did research on weapons systems for India\u2019s department of defense. Her mother, though trained as a linguist, was a homemaker. In India, many parents whose children have managed to make a life abroad regard the achievement as their own and affect a highhanded snobbery, but hers struck me as down to earth.\nKhan\u2019s parents valued education above all else. Her father showered as much attention on his daughter as he did on his son, a level of interest that was unusual in India at the time, and Khan sensed that it was because she showed more promise. But schooling two children strained the family\u2019s finances. When Khan was 9 or 10, her parents pulled her out of Rosary, a private school in Delhi where students were taught English. At the state school Khan subsequently attended, almost all her classes were in Hindi except for science. \u201cI went to college, and I barely knew English,\u201d she told me. She hung around the English speakers at college and kept silent, listening so that she could speak like them.\nIn 1981, when Khan was 23, she saw an advertisement in a journal about studying abroad at Kent State. She applied to the university\u2019s physics program, and when Kent State offered her a partial scholarship, she leapt at the chance, telling her parents that if they didn\u2019t give her the money for the ticket, she would borrow it. In America, her ambitions grew. Bored with studying in a small, provincial town in Ohio, she applied and was accepted to Columbia University\u2019s master\u2019s program in engineering, where she met Sakhawat, a Muslim from Bangladesh. In 1985, she followed him to California, defying her parents, who are Hindu and disapproved of her choice. \u201cYes, we lived together in sin for a couple of years,\u201d Khan said, laughing.\nKhan got her start in California working for technology firms. In 1995, while she was at Intel, she was given an assignment to do some research on Intel\u2019s rival, Advanced Micro Devices, and she called Raj Rajaratnam, who was then an influential analyst working at a boutique investment bank called Needham & Company. Rajaratnam happened to pick up the phone himself. They chatted amiably for a while about A.M.D., and then their conversation turned to their families. Khan told Rajaratnam that she was Punjabi. Rajaratnam, a Sri Lankan, said that his wife, Asha, was also Punjabi. Over time, Rajaratnam would exploit these sorts of tribal links, cultivating a coterie of loyal acolytes, mostly of South Asian descent, on whom he conferred favor if they gave him occasional tips.\nThe two struck up a friendship after that, dining together sometimes when Rajaratnam visited California. Though heavyset and not particularly attractive, Rajaratnam was charming \u2014 perhaps the brightest man Khan had ever met, she told me. Khan, eager to break into Wall Street, saw Rajaratnam as her ticket out of Intel. She tried to please him, faxing him confidential data on the number of computer chips the company shipped, giving him a glimpse into Intel\u2019s revenue for the quarter. In early 1998, her employer installed a video camera above the fax machine and captured Khan\u2019s stealthy communications with Rajaratnam. She quit before the company had completed their internal investigation into her crime. Her next job was working for Rajaratnam at his new hedge fund, the Galleon Group.\nAs Khan was starting her career trading technology stocks, the business was about to undergo major changes. In 2000, just before the Internet bubble lost oxygen, the Securities and Exchange Commission moved to introduce Regulation Fair Disclosure, which required publicly traded companies to share crucial information with all investors simultaneously. Before Regulation F.D., companies routinely held one-on-one meetings with hedge-fund managers or investment analysts, at which the companies offered guidance on earnings or provided information about the success of a new product rollout that could have an impact on their bottom line. The culture, especially in Silicon Valley, was chummy, with nascent technology companies vying to attract Wall Street\u2019s attention.\nBut after Regulation F.D. came into effect, companies became more guarded about divulging information. Some hedge funds, which make money from specific events, like a takeover or an earnings report, had relied on their relationships with companies for insights. The change in Regulation F.D. hurt them, and it came at a moment when the number of hedge funds was growing and competition was becoming fiercer. According to Hedge Fund Research, a group that follows the industry, at the end of 1990, there were 610 hedge funds globally; at the end of 2001, there were 4,454. More regulation, heightened competition and tougher markets meant that hedge-fund managers were always seeking new advantages.\nIn 1999, after nearly a year of working for Rajaratnam, Khan quit Galleon, wanting to start trading her own money in the Internet-stock boom. A month into trading solo, she was visited by F.B.I. agents, who confronted her with the evidence from her indiscretions at Intel. In 2001, she pleaded guilty to wire fraud, and for the next four years, chastened by her crime, she says, she played by the rules and steered clear of Rajaratnam.\nThen one day in 2005, \u201cout of the blue, I got a call as I was driving to my house,\u201d she recalled. \u201cRaj said: \u2018Oh, I haven\u2019t heard from you. How are you?\u2019 Then he gave me some skinny on the quarter at Intel.\u201d\nRajaratnam\u2019s call came at a time when Khan needed money; within a few years of the Internet bust in 2001, she had lost $49.6 million, according to her lawyer. The Khans paid cash for the Atherton house, but after the meltdown, they took out a $5 million mortgage on it. To pay it, Khan needed to generate $42,000 a month. But it wasn\u2019t only a sense of financial need that led her back to Rajaratnam; Khan\u2019s thinking about her earlier run-in with the law was starting to change. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like you are a drug addict, and you go through rehab, and you are clean,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then you are constantly at a party every day where people are doing cocaine. How long can you stay clean?\u201d She was struck by the pervasiveness of insider trading on Wall Street and the extent to which skilled traders bent the rules and took calculated risks by defying the law.\nAt Intel, she had broken the rules by supplying inside information to someone else; now she was willing to use it to make money for herself. Khan began tapping her vast network, leaning on friends, associates and even a cousin to find new avenues of information. She made inroads into Silicon Valley\u2019s close-knit South Asian community, mixing business and pleasure to her advantage. She invited Sunil Bhalla, an executive at Polycom who was dating one of her close friends, to her home for a holiday dinner in December 2005; a few weeks later, she followed up to ask how his company\u2019s quarter was looking. She played auntie to a young woman from Bangladesh who worked for an investor-relations company. Before long, the woman was feeding her information on Google, one of the firm\u2019s clients, and asking for money in exchange (Khan never paid her). Because Khan had been trading on her own, she often wasn\u2019t invited to one-on-one meetings with company executives like other money managers. \u201cThat is how you garner all your nuggets in a legal way,\u201d she said. She would talk to a young investment analyst she knew in New York named Tom Hardin. \u201cTom was my buddy,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe used to barter information all the time.\u201d\nFrom time to time, when Khan picked up a juicy bit from Bhalla or her young investor-relations friend, she would call Rajaratnam and pass it along. In 2005, she landed a job at a hedge fund, Trivium, and she liked that Rajaratnam would share information with her that she could pass on to her new bosses. She also hoped by ingratiating herself with Rajaratnam that he might hire her again.\nOn Nov. 28, 2007, Khan was working in her home office in Atherton when she heard a knock on the door. There were two people standing outside, a man and a woman. She did not recognize either of them. But \u201cthe moment they showed me their badges, my heart sank,\u201d she said.\nKhan had been maniacal about covering her tracks, registering cellphones under false names and paying off a source through an intermediary. But she was sloppy once. Two years earlier, she was receiving insider tips on Polycom\u2019s earnings from Bhalla. Distracted by the lawsuit with Deutsche Bank and fighting with her housekeeper, she called Bhalla on his cellphone and his home phone. The feds obtained these phone records and discovered that conversations between Khan and Bhalla followed an incriminating instant message Khan sent Rajaratnam: \u201cdo not buy plcm till I het guidance.\u201d When investigators showed Khan that they had the instant-message exchange, she knew she would have to come clean. \u201cWith Polycom, I felt I couldn\u2019t really lie, because they had the phone communications.\u201d (When the S.E.C. later sued Bhalla, he denied tipping Khan and reached a settlement.)\nAfter the agents left Khan\u2019s house, she found a lawyer, who advised her to cooperate with the federal investigation. But she figured she could outwit the F.B.I. \u2014 she had, after all, gotten off without jail time after her Intel indiscretion, and the government still hadn\u2019t managed to prosecute Rajaratnam.\nDuring her regular trips to New York to meet with prosecutors, she avoided contact with Rajaratnam. \u201cI knew he was the bull\u2019s-eye,\u201d she says. \u201cIn my mind, their target was Raj, and I was not going to get in their way.\u201d But she went out of her way to warn others. Once, when Khan was going to meet with prosecutors in New York, she sought out her buddy Tom Hardin. \u201cListen, the S.E.C. is asking about the Hilton trade,\u201d she told him. \u201cHave a story.\u201d Khan was so intent on protecting Hardin that at one point, she says, an F.B.I. agent screamed at her: \u201cWhat does Tom Hardin mean to you?\u201d (Hardin later pleaded guilty to insider trading.)\nKhan insists that she was driven by a desire to shield people: \u201cThey were all young kids. Some of them were my relatives. Because of the kind of relationship I had with them and how young they were, I was aghast that I was going to destroy their lives.\u201d She continued: \u201cI didn\u2019t lie for myself. I really lied for other people, which is very stupid. Everybody knew what they were doing. When someone working at an institution like Moody\u2019s comes and asks you for money, they know that is not what they should be doing.\u201d\nIt\u2019s hard to know what Khan\u2019s real motives were, but I tended to believe her expressions of sympathy for her young, ambitious colleagues, her guilt at exposing their wrongdoing in a climate of widespread rule-breaking. She spoke about the extreme temptations of making sure bets on stock trades. When we met, she\u2019d been closely watching Caterpillar and Cummins stocks. If she were still in the business of playing the markets, she said, she would have tried to short Caterpillar and go long, or take a bullish bet, on Cummins. If she\u2019d put in the trade a few days earlier, she would have made $4 or $5 a share on the Caterpillar short position, \u201cwhich is not bad,\u201d she said. So why, I asked her, had she resorted to insider trading when there was ample money to be made through good old-fashioned stock analysis?\n\u201cDo you think I would bet $1 million on my analysis?\u201d she said, with a look of mock disdain. \u201cBut if someone told me Caterpillar is going to miss its quarter, I would bet $1 million. Insider trading introduces certainty.\u201d That certainty felt like magic: A little money, with the press of a button, could become a heap of money. It\u2019s a temptation that has taken Khan much of her life to learn to resist.\nAt first Khan was reluctant to invite me into her home, saying that Sakhawat would not approve. One afternoon, when he left to pick up their daughter from school, Khan had me over for a cup of tea. Perhaps it occurred to her that it might look inhospitable not to. She apologized before inviting me in: \u201cI used to have a full-time maid. When I came to Florida, I didn\u2019t know how to run laundry. I had never mopped the floor. I think about it now. I cook, I clean, I mop. I feel this is part of my absolution.\u201d\nThe 2,500-square-foot mustard yellow house sits close to a busy intersection and is the same size as the maid\u2019s quarters in Khan\u2019s former residence in Atherton. Paint was peeling from the ceiling in the kitchen. In the living room, unironed shirts were slung over chairs, and papers were strewn across a table. A broken toilet gurgled upstairs.\nThe only vestiges of her former life were a couple of imposing and rather austere works of modern art and expensive pieces of furniture that crowded the rooms. She pointed to a stainless-steel credenza that barely fit across one wall in the dining area. It cost $20,000. I asked about the long brown couch that swallowed up most of the living room. She thought she paid between $10,000 and $15,000 for it.\nWhen I visited, Khan was a week away from celebrating her 56th birthday. She seemed addled, struggling to fashion a new identity for herself. Khan has worked since she was 27. When she was trading stocks on her own, she started her days at 6 in the morning and worked till 8 at night. \u201cEven when we had the big money, I worked,\u201d she told me. What bothered her the most, she said, is that \u201cthe thing that has made me has been taken away from me.\u201d Her probation officer suggested she find work as a cashier, but Khan believes she is capable of more.\nIn December, Khan took the G.R.E.s and scored fairly well. She applied to the Ph.D. program in finance at the Wharton School, among others. She wants to focus on insider trading and white-collar fraud. \u201cI will not be a typical Wharton Ph.D. program student,\u201d she wrote in her Wharton application essay. \u201cHowever my life experiences, although extreme, have prepared me uniquely to do research on insider trading/ethics.\u201d\nIn February, she received a rejection, but she\u2019s waiting to hear from several other schools. If she doesn\u2019t get in anywhere, she would like to write a book, perhaps go on the lecture circuit, sharing with aspiring traders and business people the cautionary tale of her easy slide into committing crimes. Addressing an issue many South Asians have raised with me about the Galleon prosecutions, Khan said flatly: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a racial angle. I don\u2019t think it had anything to do with us being Indians. I got in trouble because of my association with Raj, and Raj got in trouble because of his braggadocio.\u201d When I asked her what she thought about the fact that the leaders of the major banks who bear the most responsibility for the financial crisis in 2008 haven\u2019t been prosecuted for their crimes, she answered with her usual pragmatism: The government likes to bring cases it can win.\nOn my last day in Fort Lauderdale, Khan and I took a walk among the tall palm trees that line the beach near her house. Khan was in a reflective mood. She told me that her sister-in-law from Bangladesh said to her: \u201cBhabi,\u201d a term used to address an older brother\u2019s wife, \u201cdon\u2019t think of what you\u2019ve lost. Think of what you have, and you\u2019ll be happy.\u201d For the first time, she is trying to embrace that advice. \u201cThe worst-case scenario is I will be a housewife for the rest of my life,\u201d she told me. Then she added: \u201cI am very fortunate. I am not homeless. I still have a life.\u201d",

    "text": "13 Who Defeated Adversity Earn New York Times College Scholarships\n2015-03-12T01:36:42.000Z\nIt was one of those perfect blue-sky days when Mah Noor stepped from the subway station on her way home to her apartment in Queens and spotted the familiar-looking man, sitting on a bench in the shadow of a tree, who appeared mentally ill.\nIt took a few moments for her to realize the man was her father. So begins an essay by Ms. Noor, now 18, submitted as an application to the New York Times College Scholarship program, which has been supporting high-achieving students from poor families in New York City\u2019s five boroughs since 1999. The program has graduated more than 250 scholars over the years.\nNeatly dressed and vibrating with enthusiasm, Ms. Noor sat in The Times\u2019s office on Wednesday afternoon, one of 13 winners of the scholarships, which provide mentoring, internships at The New York Times Company and financial help for college. Her father\u2019s illness had had a major impact on her life, she said \u2014 until she discovered that she could decide how it would affect her: \u201cI realized maybe I have to take what\u2019s happening in my life and turn it into what\u2019s positive, participating, and expanding my horizons.\u201d\nMs. Noor, who was born in Faisalabad, Pakistan, catapulted herself into the model United Nations program, ranked third in her class of over 700 students at Hillcrest High School, and became a docent at the New York Aquarium, where she teaches children about horseshoe crabs. She wants to become a heart surgeon, or a pharmacist, but mostly a model for her family, untying the Gordian knot of illness.\n\u201cI want to show my parents that breaking through these things isn\u2019t a bad thing,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m growing as a person.\u201d\nPaige Pagan, 18, volunteers at a nursing home. At her own home in the Bronx she helps her mother, who has debilitating fibromyalgia, and cares for her father, who has cirrhosis. She found her strength as a ballerina, but with two parents unable to work, she felt ashamed of her shabby dance clothes at first. Today she dances with confidence, Ms. Pagan said.\n\u201cIt clicked for me, I\u2019m meant to be in the limelight,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether I\u2019m an underdog or not, I can do the same things you can do.\u201d She wants to be a doctor, or perhaps a journalist covering medical breakthroughs.\nMs. Pagan\u2019s mantra echoes the 17-year-old Fatima Khan\u2019s take on life, one gleaned in the lunchroom of Bronx Metropolitan High School, where girls bullied her, she said, because she has Asperger\u2019s syndrome. When a group of girls shunned her at a lunch table, forcing her to sit somewhere else, Ms. Khan became best friends with the student she sat next to. She has made honor roll since sixth grade and is a member of the National Honor Society.\nPeople with her condition have a tendency to fixate on a subject, she recognizes, and Ms. Khan has honed her passion for Super Mario video games into a goal to design a game herself, and make digital products that bring people joy. \u201cIf something bad happens to you, you should do the best you can, to make everything positive for yourself,\u201d she said.\nEsoteric pursuits are Shaafi Sabir\u2019s lifeblood, but archery, steam trains and pocket watches are rarely discussed on the streets of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, where he grew up, his life splintered by a violent mugging on his doorstep when he was 14. Hobbies, study and new passions have helped him recover. Now he is 18, and college and building airplanes are his goal, but above all, he hopes college will be a chance at last, he said, to find people with the same interests as his (\u201cwhich goes a long way when you\u2019re a nerd\u201d).\nCarlos Ycaza-Zurita, 18, wakes at 2 a.m. almost seven days a week and delivers newspapers with his mother on the Upper West Side of Manhattan before school, picking up the slack left after his father abandoned the family. But no matter how exhausted he is, he is always wide awake in math class, his passion.\nIn Togo, where she is from, Oumou Zakaria\u2019s father had several wives, whom she said he mistreated, eventually infecting her mother with H.I.V. His disdain for women has made Ms. Zakaria, 18, strive to become a doctor to help stem her homeland\u2019s high infant and childbirth mortality rate \u2014 and to prove her father wrong. \u201cHe\u2019s challenging me,\u201d she said on Wednesday. \u201cI want to tell him that girls are the same as boys. Maybe better.\u201d\nSelena Bermeo, 17, now loves to scoop flavored ice from a pushcart for little children on Sundays, but she once felt shame that peddling ices was what her father and mother, immigrants from Ecuador, did for a living, and shame about what she and her family did before to get by: pick cans from the trash. The struggle has made her strong. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of what they do now,\u201d said Ms. Bermeo, who wants to be a teacher, \u201cThey are just working to give us a little life.\u201d\nThe scholars are linked by their refusal to be confined by their financial struggles, and without exception, each desires to give back.\nThey want to be doctors, like Likita Griffith, 17, who is also a gifted writer, creating stories about witnessing mothers lose children to gun violence in her Brooklyn neighborhood, and vowing to not repeat the cycle. Or artists and architects, like Daniel Blanc, 18, who draws feather-fluffed owls in graphite with the skill of a young Audubon, spends his free time tutoring and dreams of designing municipal buildings that make cities and people\u2019s lives better.\nOr engineers, like Kawkab Abid, 17, who watched his rural home village, Meherpur, in Bangladesh get washed away by a typhoon, and now devours computer science at his high school in Queens, seeking the skills to help communities build back stronger.\nWhen Hurricane Sandy hit, Michael Borrello, 18, lost his house in Howard Beach, Queens; it was a minor storm compared with losing his father unexpectedly shortly before. The instability made him grab life with gusto, taking up skateboarding, boxing and mixed martial arts and delving into model business classes at school in Manhattan. \u201cIt\u2019s horrifying to me to have my family kind of break apart,\u201d he said. \u201cI always do my best to show that I\u2019m strong, to keep them strong.\u201d\nLeaving school each afternoon, most students dread homework, but for Jachai Omotayo, 17, his fears included whether he would have food that night, and if he would be living in the same place he left that morning, having spent the past 10 years bouncing through homeless shelters. He devoured self-help books, Zen Buddhism and meditation to cope with the chaos, volunteering and raising money for charity.\nDavid Kela, 17, and his family were also homeless after fleeing conflict in the Ivory Coast. Today the honor roll student, who is also a cashier at a Marshall\u2019s on Staten Island, where he lives, plans to be a petroleum engineer.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t think we could go that far,\u201c he said of his family. \u201cWe now have hope for the future.\u201d",

    "text": "Who\u2019s Speaking Up for the American Worker?\n2015-06-25T07:21:30.000Z\nROCKY MOUNT, Va. \u2014 A WOMAN came up to the book-signing table at an event at my local library Monday night. She did not have a copy of the newly released paperback of \u201cFactory Man,\u201d my book about what happened when 300,000 American furniture-making jobs were offshored to Asia.\nBut she waited a half-hour in the signing line anyway, to introduce herself and to tell me she was one of the more than 550 people laid off in 2001 when Furniture Brands International closed its Lane Furniture plant in this former mill town.\nShe couldn\u2019t afford the $17 book, she whispered, because she was doing housecleaning and other off-the-books, part-time work. (I offered to give her one, but her gainfully employed sister-in-law ended up buying her a copy before I could get to the box of books I keep in my car, for just such occasions.)\nIn the front row of the auditorium where I spoke sat a retired sales executive from Bassett Furniture Industries. He\u2019d spent his career nearby in the eponymous company town of Bassett, a place that used to teem with seven factories set along the banks of the Smith River. In retirement, he and his wife live comfortably in a sprawling home in the nearby resort community of Smith Mountain Lake.\nBut they\u2019ve had a hard time renting out property they still own in Bassett, which saw its factories close, one after the other, as the company offshored nearly all of its wood furniture production to China, Vietnam and Indonesia in the wake of trade liberalization and China\u2019s admission into the World Trade Organization.\nAt the other end of the front row sat another septuagenarian retiree, whose eyes filled with tears, as I showed pictures of and spoke about the people who line up outside the region\u2019s food pantries two hours before the doors open. His story was like that of others in the crowd: His mother was raised in a Bassett-owned home, and his father lost fingers to the company\u2019s saws. He\u2019s also a native of Henry County, which has lost nearly half its jobs in the past two decades \u2014 not just factory work but also jobs in the smaller companies that supplied the factories, and in the mom-and-pop stores and diners where factory workers used to spend their cash.\nUnfettered free trade has not only put the Henry County region near the top of Virginia\u2019s unemployment rankings for more than a decade, but it has also ushered in an era of soaring food insecurity and Social Security disability claims.\nAnd crime, too. A sheriff\u2019s deputy told me at another book signing that many of his calls are now related to methamphetamine and heroin. An unemployed man accidentally set an abandoned factory on fire while trying to rip out copper electrical wires to sell on the black market; he was riding a bicycle, an unusual sight in this hilly, rural, car-reliant area.\nAfter weeks of Congressional chess over the Asia-Pacific trade accord, with lawmakers finagling new methods to pass or block trade-negotiating authority \u2014 depending on the day \u2014 the so-called \u201cfast track\u201d is now on President Obama\u2019s desk, a crucial step toward completion of the accord, known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nEconomists aren\u2019t sure how many factory jobs will be lost as a result, but even T.P.P. proponents have acknowledged probable losses, especially in lower-skilled, labor-intensive manufacturing.\nPeople living in rural America just want someone in Washington to level with them:\nWill T.P.P. protect American jobs or hasten their demise? In talks and readings I\u2019m giving across Appalachia\u2019s former furniture belt, that\u2019s always the first question I\u2019m asked.\nIt\u2019s a complicated question, obscured by dueling political interests, statistics slingers and documents that have been leaked as a public-interest workaround to secret T.P.P. negotiations and a closely guarded draft (though some 600 lobbyists were granted access to the negotiating texts).\nI am not in possession of an economic crystal ball. But unlike most of the lawmakers deciding the fate of America\u2019s role in international trade, I have spent much of the past three years talking to dislocated workers still living in former factory towns. Most believe that T.P.P. is simply the North American Free Trade Agreement \u201con steroids,\u201d a done deal driven by corporate greed-heads and the lobbyists they employ.\nWhen they hear proponents argue that T.P.P. will liberalize trade in high-tech services and agriculture, making it possible to expand America\u2019s exports, they automatically replay President Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201cwin-win\u201d prediction from early 2000: China\u2019s entrance into the W.T.O. would not cost Americans their jobs but would instead protect them, Mr. Clinton insisted, because American companies would soon export more goods to China\u2019s growing consumer class.\nEventually.\nIn theory.\nAnd notwithstanding the fact that many Chinese factories were not above dumping, or illegally underpricing, their products, to capture American market share.\nAs long as the consumer gets a slightly cheaper price on her bluejeans and bedroom suites, who cares if China or any other country isn\u2019t playing by W.T.O. rules or adhering to labor and environmental standards?\nConsumers and journalists alike had failed to connect the dots between escalating crime in dying factory towns and page-three wire stories about Bangladesh textile factory fires. And why would they? The small-town reporter has little license to cover the goings-on of the W.T.O. or the United States International Trade Commission, and the few reporters who do cover international trade rarely venture to towns like Rocky Mount or Bassett.\nAll of which suits the press-avoiding chief executives just fine. The shareholders matter most.\nThe globalization of low-skilled manufacturing is already a fait accompli, T.P.P. proponents have argued, and the furniture- and textile-making jobs that once made the Piedmont region of the mid-Atlantic hum are not coming back from China or Mexico.\nBut what about the other manufacturing jobs we\u2019ve managed to hold onto in the United States? How would the 1,350 workers at New Balance\u2019s Maine and Massachusetts factories fare, if faced with the elimination of tariffs on shoes made by Vietnamese workers who earn an average of $90 to $129 a month?\nAs imports soared in the decade following 2001, American manufacturing sector jobs dropped by roughly a third. There are now more American workers on disability (8.9 million) than are working on assembly lines (8.6 million). And among the displaced workers in southside Virginia who were retrained via Trade Adjustment Assistance funds \u2014 only about a third of trade-displaced workers in Virginia opt for federally funded retraining \u2014 most end up with lesser-paying service jobs, many of them part-time.\n\u201cI take the global long view,\u201d said an urban planner and T.P.P. supporter who came to a talk I gave last week in Greensboro, N.C., another former furniture-making region. He\u2019s right that globalization has fostered better living conditions in the developing world. But improving the lives of Indonesian peasants willing to work for desperately low wages really has nothing to do with the decisions that closed some 63,300 American factories between 2001 and 2012.\nThose decisions were made by the biggest beneficiaries of unfettered free trade, in a story line that seems straight out of a Michael Moore documentary: the C.E.O. who now earns 300 times more than his average worker; the shareholders who expect quarter-after-quarter growth in corporate profits; the lawyers who helped devise the fine print in the T.P.P. document and the lobbyists they hire who, if the leaks are to be believed, think nothing of cutting off the supply of new generic drugs for decades.\nUnlike most of the people in my rural, conservative audiences, I\u2019d still like to think President Obama means it when he says the T.P.P. will increase economic growth and expand United States exports.\nBut I\u2019m stymied by the secrecy, I tell the people who turn up at my book events, and by the influence of corporate money in election campaigns. I\u2019m troubled, too, by the failure to bring about a compromise that would prohibit currency manipulation in countries that are part of the T.P.P. like Japan and Malaysia, which distort their currencies to give their own exports a boost.\nI worry that T.P.P. will simply exacerbate income inequality. Then I show them a slide from Bassett, Va., circa 1942. A couple stands in front of a company house, with their little girl, Bettie, in front of them.\nThe little girl, now in her late 70s, told me she was so poor growing up that, lacking pencils and paper, she learned to write by tracing her letters in the condensation on the windows. But she went to college on her father\u2019s factory wages, and she grew up to become an inner-city social worker with a master\u2019s degree. That was the upward mobility trajectory in America before globalization.\nThen I show them another black and white, this one of a ragamuffin girl, circa 1969. When the economy was good, her mother soldered airplane lights at a local factory. When it was bad, her mother picked up under-the-table jobs like waitressing and babysitting for other people\u2019s kids.\nThat little girl, now 51, was the first in her family to go to college, and she threaded the needle of early trickle-down economics quite by luck: She came of age when it was still possible for a promising poor kid to go to college solely on Pell grants and other need-based financial aid.\nThat little girl in the picture is me, standing in the driveway of a ramshackle house in Urbana, Ohio. I did not grow up to become an economist spouting theories of creative destruction. But I\u2019ve spent the past several years telling the tale of the people left behind, teetering in globalization\u2019s wake.\nI wish I could tell the people in my audiences exactly who will benefit most from T.P.P.\nBut anything this secretive, and this marked by corporate influence, leaves little room for doubt: It will not be America\u2019s factory workers.",

    "text": "A Migrant Mother\u2019s Anguished Choice\n2015-07-06T00:37:46.000Z\nGELUGOR, Malaysia \u2014 Carrying one child in her arm, a second on her back and holding the hand of a third, Hasinah Izhar waded waist-deep through a mangrove swamp into the Bay of Bengal, toward a fishing boat bobbing in the dusk.\n\u201cTroops are coming, troops are coming,\u201d the smuggler said. \u201cGet on the boat quickly.\u201d\nIf she was going to change her mind, she would have to do it now.\nMs. Izhar, 33, had reached the muddy shore after sneaking down the dirt paths and around the fish ponds of western Myanmar, where she and about one million other members of the Rohingya minority are stateless, shunned and persecuted for their Muslim faith.\nShe had signed up for passage to Malaysia, but knew that the voyage would be treacherous, that even if she survived, the smugglers would demand ransom before letting her and her children go, and that they sometimes beat, tortured or sold into slavery those who could not pay.\nHer husband, who had raised shrimp and cattle, had been among tens of thousands who made the journey two years earlier, after Buddhist mobs rampaged through villages like their own, burning houses and killing at least 200 people. He had warned her not to follow, telling her that the trip was too dangerous and too expensive.\nBut as she reached the wooden skiff that would take them on the first leg of a weekslong journey, one terrible fact weighed heaviest: She had left behind her oldest child, a 13-year-old boy named Jubair.\nSince 2012, tens of thousands of Rohingya have fled Myanmar, where they are officially considered intruders. The exodus exploded into a regional crisis in May after smugglers abandoned thousands of them at sea, leaving them adrift with little food or water and no country willing to take them in.\nAmid a global outcry, Malaysia and Indonesia eventually agreed to accept the migrants, temporarily.\nBut lost in the diplomatic wrangling over the fate of the Rohingya are the anguished choices faced by the families who leave and the harrowing personal consequences they must endure.\nMs. Izhar knew it would cost as much as $2,000 just to bring her three youngest children to Malaysia. Taking Jubair could double the smugglers\u2019 price, and she had only $500 from selling their house, a bamboo and mud-daub hut in the village of Thayet Oak.\nThe eighth of 10 children raised by a farming couple, she had spent her entire life in the countryside around the village. She was married there at 18, and lost her first husband to a sudden illness.\nShe relied on help from relatives to support her two gangly boys, Jubair and Junaid. A few years later, she married again and had another boy, Sufaid, and then a girl, Parmin.\nIt was while she was pregnant with Parmin that her husband fled to Malaysia.\nBuddhist militants, incensed by rumors that Muslims had raped a Buddhist woman, had attacked villages like Thayet Oak across Rakhine State, the coastal region home to most of Myanmar\u2019s Rohingya. The police and the army stood by and did nothing.\nWorried that he would be arrested and beaten like some of his friends, Ms. Izhar\u2019s husband, Dil Muhammad Rahman, went into hiding, making fleeting visits home in the dead of night. Then in late 2012, he disappeared entirely, not calling to tell her that he had gone to Malaysia until three months after he arrived.\nViolence against the Rohingya flared again last year. Ms. Izhar heard rumors of children being shot. She saw police officers break a man\u2019s hand and strike another in the head with clubs, leaving him bleeding and unconscious.\nWomen living alone were especially vulnerable, and when night fell, she kept the house dark and hushed her children. \u201cI didn\u2019t even light a lamp,\u201d she said.\nFear was a constant. By December, when word of ships waiting in the Bay of Bengal spread through the villages, she could not wait any longer.\n\u201cHow can I stay here?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe old, the young, everyone has to keep watch on the village every night to protect the women. All the women are going to Malaysia, so I will go to Malaysia, too.\u201d\nNow, as she heaved her children into the boat in the darkness, her mind was a jumble of relief, fear and regret.\nMalaysia is a Muslim nation, she knew, and she believed she and her children would be safe there.\nBut she had not told her husband they were coming. She hoped he would still be happy to see them, and that he would find the money to pay the smugglers.\n\u201cI had to take the boat full of sadness and fear in my heart,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband wouldn\u2019t let anyone kill us. He would rescue us somehow.\u201d\nMost of all, though, she was tormented by the thought of Jubair.\nWhat would become of him, alone in Thayet Oak, exposed to the very dangers she was running from? What would have become of her other children if they had stayed?\nWhen it was time to leave, Jubair was off with friends in another village, and there was no time to think. She gathered up the other children, packed a bundle with a few changes of clothes for the children and three plastic bottles of water, and fled.\nNow, as the shoreline receded in the distance, she wished she had had a chance to explain her decision to Jubair, and to hug him goodbye.\n\u201cSome words came to my mind,\u201d she recalled later. \u201cIf I can stay alive, I will bring him to Malaysia. I felt very sad to leave my boy behind, but it would be better for the family if we left to live or die somewhere else. We couldn\u2019t stay.\u201d\nAfter a few hours, the passengers were transferred to a motorboat, which bounced through the dark, choppy sea, nauseating her, and later transferred again, to a ship somewhere in the Bay of Bengal.\nMs. Izhar and her children huddled with a dozen women and their children on the deck. Men and teenage boys were led to the hold.\nMost of the 250 or so passengers spoke Rohingya, while some sounded as if they were from Bangladesh.\nIn the morning, the crew handed out the first meal that she and her children would have since leaving their village two days earlier: lumps of cold, precooked rice and pieces of palm sugar. Ms. Izhar, seasick, had trouble holding it down. She vomited repeatedly.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep for six days and six nights,\u201d she said. \u201cOne son was on my right side, one son was on my left side, and the small one was on my chest. We couldn\u2019t move around. We just sat and waited, and I tried to keep the children from wandering around. What if they fell overboard? Nobody would pull them out.\u201d\nIt was December, and the small Rohingya family had become so much cargo in the growing, multinational people-smuggling businesses.\nSmugglers took around 58,000 people, mostly from Myanmar and Bangladesh, on the journey last year through the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea, often via southern Thailand and then on to Malaysia, according to the International Organization for Migration. They took 25,000 more people in the first three months of this year.\nMany Rohingya ended up trading one nightmare for another. Some were confined for weeks to fetid, cramped holds reeking of vomit and excrement. Some were detained in prisonlike way stations in southern Thailand, subject to beatings and torture as the smugglers extorted payments from their families.\nHundreds died during the journey each year, from starvation, dehydration and, at times, brutality.\nAs the ship lurched southeast, Ms. Izhar began to grasp the perils at hand. The women were generally spared beatings, but men were punched, shoved and slapped if they irritated the crew, she said.\nLate one afternoon, the ship erupted in shouting and screaming when some of the crew members prepared to sling overboard the inert body of an older man, whose hands and legs had been bound with rope.\n\u201cHe looked like he was dead, or maybe very close to it,\u201d Ms. Izhar said. \u201cBut all of a sudden he started jerking around and twisting and shouting, and then everyone was shouting, \u2018He\u2019s alive! He\u2019s alive!\u2019\u201d\nThe crew beat the man into submission and took him below deck. Ms. Izhar did not know what happened to him after that.\nAfter about a week at sea, Ms. Izhar\u2019s family reached a much larger ship, where they joined hundreds of other migrants. The crew included people from Thailand, as well as some other Rohingya, and they spoke as if the ship was somewhere off Thailand. She and the children were ordered down to a stinking, crowded hold three levels below the top deck.\nSoon after the passengers boarded, the smugglers demanded that they hand over the phone numbers of family members and relatives who were expected to pay for the journey.\nMs. Izhar pulled her husband\u2019s number from her tattered bundle of belongings, and in the morning crew members led her away to call him.\nOne of the crew told her husband that his wife was in Thailand. That was the first he knew that she had left Myanmar.\nMs. Izhar got on the phone and told him the smugglers were demanding about $2,100 in return for releasing her and the three children.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the money to pay for you!\u201d he shouted angrily, and demanded to know why she had left Jubair behind.\nIt is not uncommon for Rohingya women joining their husbands abroad to do so without telling them. If a woman told her husband, \u201cmost of the time the husband would not allow her to leave,\u201d said Chris Lewa, a Rohingya rights advocate based in Bangkok. The men fear that if their families join them, they will be saddled with more expenses for a larger apartment or an extra room.\nNor is it uncommon for migrants to be separated from their spouses or children for long periods.\nMs. Izhar and her children stayed in the hold for weeks while their fate was negotiated. Twice a day, they received water and food: usually a scoop of rice with lentils or dried fish so putrid that she could barely swallow it, although the famished children wolfed down their servings.\nThe smugglers kept up the pressure. One whipped Ms. Izhar several times on the back and waist with a piece of heavy plastic tubing, and they called her husband repeatedly.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want your family released?\u201d one asked him. \u201cIf you don\u2019t they will be thrown into the water.\u201d\nHaggling ensued. The smugglers\u2019 price dropped to $1,700.\nMr. Rahman begged everyone he knew for help: relatives, friends, friends of friends. \u201cI started weeping; I would crouch at their feet,\u201d he said. He told them: \u201cFor the sake of my children, I will pay you back. If I cannot, I will be a slave for you.\u201d\nOver three weeks after the bargaining began, the money arrived, most of it from an uncle.\nThree days later, Ms. Izhar and her three children boarded a motorboat with dozens of other migrants, and soon anchored off a beach in northern Malaysia. Most Rohingya enter Malaysia after trekking through the jungle of southern Thailand. But Ms. Izhar ended her voyage much as she had started it: trudging through the muddy edge of the sea as she waded ashore.\n\u201cI felt happy,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought how much trouble our journey had been, and now it was nearly over.\u201d\nFrom the nearest city, Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine State, the village of Thayet Oak is a 45-minute ferry ride, then a four-hour drive along rutted dirt roads.\nThe first villager who appeared there was asked if he knew a 13-year-old boy named Jubair. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, and pointed down a dusty dirt road. At the end of the road, a boy in a dirty orange shirt was carrying two aluminum water jugs on the ends of a bamboo pole. \u201cThat\u2019s him.\u201d\nEveryone in Thayet Oak seems to know Jubair, the boy who was left behind.\nIn a dark room of his cousin\u2019s bamboo house, where he sometimes sleeps, he sat on the dirt floor and patiently answered questions.\nWhere is your home?\n\u201cMy mother sold the house to pay for the boat fees.\u201d\nWhy did your mother leave without you?\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know about it. She could not find me. She could not tell me. I was in another person\u2019s house. I was lost.\u201d\nWhere is your father?\n\u201cHe died.\u201d\nOf what?\n\u201cI do not know. I was young.\u201d\nAre you going to school?\n\u201cI have not been enrolled this year.\u201d\nWhat do you do?\n\u201cI work at a person\u2019s house. I fetch water for him.\u201d\nAre you happy doing this work?\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nDo you want to go to school?\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nSchool is unlikely. The village, a collection of hamlets with about 5,700 inhabitants, has no secondary school. For most children here, an education means a few years of religious school learning to recite the Quran and the Arabic alphabet, though not enough to read.\nSix months after his mother left, he remained baffled as to why she did not take him along.\n\u201cI think maybe she didn\u2019t have enough money,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly.\u201d\nThayet Oak means mango orchard in Burmese, but the reality is less idyllic.\nRohingya are denied citizenship by the Myanmar government, and the residents of Thayet Oak must seek permission before leaving the village, even to collect firewood in the nearby jungle. At a guard post outside the village, police officers watch everyone who comes in and out.\nThe village has no sanitation, postal service, electricity, computers or a single television set. \u201cThere are very few jobs here,\u201d Dil Muhammad, a village elder, said. \u201cPeople feel trapped.\u201d\nHundreds of young men have left. Villagers are inured to departures and the reality that those who leave almost never return.\nIn early May, a shrimp farmer, Salim Ullah, noticed Jubair sitting in a bamboo shack that serves as the local grocery store.\n\u201cWhen I asked people, they said he has no father. His mother left already,\u201d Mr. Ullah said. \u201cI asked where does he stay? They said he just stays on the street.\u201d\nJubair\u2019s bed had been the sandy, orange-brown dirt road.\nMr. Ullah said he had taken Jubair into his home as a servant, giving him work fetching water for the equivalent of $9 a month. Jubair brought along his only belongings: three tattered shirts and two sarongs.\n\u201cHe can stay for as long as he wants,\u201d Mr. Ullah said.\nThe bamboo and thatch house is packed with Mr. Ullah\u2019s family, including his five children, his sister and her two children.\nJubair fetches water a dozen times in the morning and again in the evening. He walks barefoot \u2014 he does not own shoes \u2014 several hundred yards down a dirt path that leads to a well, fills two dented metal jugs and walks back, balancing them on either end of a bamboo pole.\nWhen he is not working, he tries to be a normal child. He plays with friends, a mischievous smile occasionally crossing his face.\nHe is a bright boy who quickly grasped the questions of visitors. But he cannot read or write and stared blankly when asked what job he aspired to have. \u201cI want an education,\u201d he said.\nHe has spoken to his mother six or seven times since her departure. She calls a neighbor\u2019s phone, and the neighbors summon him.\nWhat did your mother say to you the last time you spoke?\n\u201cShe said, \u2018Son, don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t be sad, stay well.\u2019\u201d\nDo you miss your mother?\nHe could not speak, and started to cry.\nTwo days after she landed in Malaysia, more than a month after her journey began, Ms. Izhar was driven to Penang Island, where her husband was working on a building site. Mr. Rahman beamed as he held Parmin for the first time.\nBut there were also pained questions as he looked at his emaciated family.\n\u201cHow could you come to Malaysia with such small children?\u201d he said. \u201cWhy did you leave Jubair behind?\u201d\nAt least 75,000 Rohingya live in Malaysia as registered refugees or unregistered migrants, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Rohingya groups say the unregistered number is much higher.\nLife is safer in Malaysia, and there are more potential jobs than in rural Rakhine State. But under Malaysian law, neither refugees nor unregistered migrants can legally work. They receive no welfare, and most of the men struggle to pick up informal jobs as day laborers. Their children cannot attend government schools, and they must vie for the limited places in crowded, makeshift schools supported by charities and international aid.\n\u201cWe are illegal here, too,\u201d Ms. Izhar said. \u201cWe belong to nowhere. On the ship, we thought we would have a peaceful and comfortable life in Malaysia. Now after arriving in Malaysia we face more hardships.\u201d\nThe crisis at sea has subsided for now. Smugglers are lying low and the monsoon season has deterred escapes by sea. But experts say both the smuggling climate and the weather will change in a few months, and the exodus will resume.\nNearly six months after her voyage, Ms. Izhar and her family share a small, two-story house with 13 other people, mostly Rohingya, in Gelugor, a district of Penang that is a mosaic of middle-class homes and cheap housing, much of it occupied by migrants.\nShe rises at 6:30 to pray; cook breakfast for her family, often rice and an omelet; prepare her son Junaid for a school for refugees; and tidy the cramped, airless bedroom where the couple and three children sleep on a tattered, full-size mattress.\nMr. Rahman walks to a spot beside an expressway where he waits for building and maintenance contractors looking for workers. If he is lucky, he can earn $8 to $16 for a day\u2019s work, carrying bricks, cutting grass, or other menial work.\nBut most days he comes home empty-handed. He has fallen three months behind on the rent for the room, about $94 a month, and faces eviction. There is also pressure to repay more than $1,000 he still owes his friends and relatives, the money he borrowed to pay the smugglers.\n\u201cPeople I owe money to always call and ask me to pay their money back,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019d known what the situation was really like here, I probably wouldn\u2019t have left my country.\u201d\nBetween household chores, Ms. Izhar waits, consumed by doubt.\nShe waits for word from her husband about whether he has found work. She waits for the family to win official status as refugees, an uncertain process that can take years. She waits for a time, seemingly out of reach, when her family can be reunited.\nThe hours and days blur together. The clock on the bedroom wall has lost its hands, which have fallen to the bottom of the glass case.\n\u201cAs a mother, living without my eldest son is emotional torment for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare bring my son over on the same hard journey I took. But as a mother, I feel like bringing my son back to me.\u201d\nFinally, Mr. Rahman returns. It was another fruitless day of waiting for work.\nHe slumps on a couch in the garage. A smile flashes across his face when Ms. Izhar brings out the two youngest children.\nHe hugs them and weeps quietly.",

    "text": "From the Gates Foundation, Direct Investment, Not Just Grants\n2015-03-13T00:21:54.000Z\nThe Ebola crisis underscored a problem that vexes experts in global health: Vaccines are one of the most cost-effective ways to save lives, especially in developing countries, yet traditional vaccines can take years to develop.\nSo when the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation came across CureVac, a biopharmaceutical company working on technology that could produce vaccines faster, cheaper and more effectively, it not only took note \u2014 it took a stake in the company.\nThe foundation, which has distributed billions of dollars in grants to improve health and living conditions in developing countries, is increasingly expanding its tool kit, using some of its capital to invest directly in companies that could help advance its goals.\nThe foundation has made about a dozen direct equity investments in companies over the last couple of years under the umbrella of program-related investing, as it is called in foundation circles. It backs ideas that others might deem too risky, or gains access to technology that might otherwise bypass the needs of the poor. Whereas most foundations use this kind of investing to provide loans for nonprofit entities, the Gates Foundation\u2019s investment interests are primarily in the private sector.\n\u201cEarly-stage investing allows us to tackle problems that we couldn\u2019t tackle before,\u201d said Julie Sunderland, who heads the program-related investments, which is run independently of the foundation\u2019s $43.5 billion endowment.\nLast week, the foundation made its largest such investment, a $52 million equity stake in CureVac, a 15-year-old company backed by Dietmar Hopp, co-founder of SAP. It has been developing a technology that uses the biomolecule mRNA to give the body instructions for creating its own proteins to fight cancer and infectious diseases. Cancer has been the company\u2019s primary focus; it has a prostate cancer therapy in Phase 2 development, in which it is tested in patients for efficacy and safety. The foundation wants to ensure that the technology can be put to work preventing diseases that disproportionately affect the world\u2019s poor.\nThe foundation\u2019s chief executive, Sue Desmond-Hellmann, a medical doctor who was formerly president of product development for Genentech, was quick to point out that investing is just one tool for moving the needle on the foundation\u2019s charitable causes. Nevertheless, the foundation has more than tripled the size of the program since it began with $400 million in 2009. It now has $1.5 billion on hand for loans, equity investments and volume guarantees.\n\u201cThe way I look at it is, we are trying to solve some pretty hard problems, and we need to bring everything to bear,\u201d Ms. Desmond-Hellmann said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t involve private industry, we\u2019re leaving out a powerful tool.\u201d\nMs. Sunderland has expanded her team, which now has 15 investment specialists, including three former biotechnology venture capitalists. They are supported by the foundation\u2019s in-house experts in fields as varied as microfinance and malaria, and they have direct access to Mr. Gates, who looks over every deal.\nThough the foundation\u2019s biggest area of focus has been in health care, it has used program-related investments in other areas, like education, agriculture and financial services for the poor. One such investment is bKash, a joint venture between BRAC bank in Bangladesh and Money in Motion, a United States firm, to offer a banking solution to the poor. The company, which the foundation initially financed with grants, lets users turn a basic mobile phone into a means of storing and transferring money. Rather than go to a bank branch, they deposit or withdraw money through merchants set up to offer bKash services.\nLast year the foundation invested $11 million in bKash to, among other things, further build out its network of \u201chuman A.T.M.s,\u201d now more than 110,000 merchants supporting 16.5 million customers and 70 million monthly transactions. \u201cThe impact of those small amounts is more than $100 million in the banking system that would have otherwise been in a mattress,\u201d said Kamal Quadir, the chief executive of bKash.\nTo identify and appraise ideas, the foundation\u2019s investment team works closely with program teams in education, global development and global health. If both groups agree on an idea\u2019s potential, they form a deal team and pitch the idea to an investment committee that focuses solely on program-related investments.\n\u201cWhen we started the investment committee, people were so polite, they didn\u2019t want to offend anybody,\u201d said Ms. Sunderland, who had worked in private equity and advised foundations, governments and development institutions before joining the foundation in 2009. Now, she said, both sides have learned to ask tough questions, and the program teams have adopted many of the same processes for making grants.\nUltimately, the decision to move forward with a deal takes into account the social impact of an investment and its economic viability. \u201cWe are not rate-of-return investors, but we need to be conscious of this if we want co-investors who think about rate of return,\u201d said Trevor Mundel, president of the foundation\u2019s global health division.\nWhile these deals resemble those made in the for-profit world, the bar is arguably higher. \u201cIn venture capital, you can have a successful exit even if the product ultimately fails,\u201d Mr. Mundel added. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that option. The things we invest in have to actually work.\u201d\nFor the companies or venture capitalists considering an investment from the foundation, it is also a balancing act.\nEntering a deal, the foundation makes clear the expectations tied to its investment dollars, said Kim Kamdar, a partner with Domain Associates, a venture capital firm that specializes in health care. When the foundation was looking to invest in one of her firm\u2019s portfolio companies, Sera Prognostics, its board went through the pros and cons of working with the foundation, which is interested in using Sera\u2019s technology to assess the risk of preterm birth in developing countries. In the end, Ms. Kamdar said, they welcomed the partnership.\n\u201cIf you are truly looking at a global solution, you need access to samples all over the world,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Gates Foundation can provide that and open a lot of doors for a company.\u201d\nJust as many venture capital firms are expected to do more than write a check, the Gates team will take on the role of strategic investor, working with companies on areas like research and business development.\n\u201cThere is an embedded sensibility of how to get something done, even though their goals are slightly different,\u201d said Terry McGuire, founding partner of the venture capital firm Polaris Partners. Not only does the foundation provide a relatively stable source of capital to emerging companies, he said, it has ties in academia, government and private industry.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we traded away anything in partnering with them,\u201d said Steven Brugger, the chief executive of Affinivax, a start-up in Cambridge, Mass., that specializes in vaccines. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique opportunity to build a company where you can develop vaccines that can be commercial blockbusters but also develop vaccines that can have a tremendous impact on the developing world.\u201d\nYet under typical market economics, a company like CureVac would most likely focus on the most profitable applications. \u201cYou could be waiting a long time for some of these vaccines to come to fruition,\u201d said Andrew Farnum, deputy director of program-related investments at the foundation. \u201cWe looked at this and said, \u2018If this works, we want to be in on the ground floor and have broad access to all of our diseases.\u2019\u201d\nBy taking an equity stake to help CureVac build out its platform \u2014 and offering grants to support specific projects \u2014 the foundation can ensure that CureVac devotes some of its resources to making low-cost vaccines for the poor. At the same time, the company can commercialize and license these products while continuing its work in other areas, like cancer. \u201cWhat our investment does is allow them to continue with their current plans and expand their focus,\u201d Mr. Farnum said. \u201cIt allows them to do more.\u201d\nThis is not to say that every private enterprise has jumped at the chance to work with the foundation. Companies have said no, Ms. Sunderland said, \u201cand I\u2019m pretty comfortable with that.\u201d",

    "text": "A Mass Migration Crisis, and It May Yet Get Worse\n2015-10-31T18:28:22.000Z\nSID, Serbia \u2014 They arrived in an unceasing stream, 10,000 a day at the height, as many as a million migrants heading for Europe this year, pushing infants in strollers and elderly parents in wheelchairs, carrying children on their shoulders and life savings in their socks. They came in search of a new life, but in many ways they were the heralds of a new age.\nThere are more displaced people and refugees now than at any other time in recorded history \u2014 60 million in all \u2014 and they are on the march in numbers not seen since World War II. They are coming not just from Syria, but from an array of countries and regions, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Gaza, even Haiti, as well as any of a dozen or so nations in sub-Saharan and North Africa. They are unofficial ambassadors of failed states, unending wars, intractable conflicts.\nThe most striking thing about the current migration crisis, however, is how much bigger it could still get.\nWhat if Islamic State militants are not beaten back but continue to extend their brutal writ across Iraq and Syria? What if the Taliban continue to increase their territorial gains in Afghanistan, prompting even more people to flee? A quarter of Afghans told a Gallup Poll that they want to leave, and more than 100,000 are expected to try to flee to Europe this year. \nThere are between six million and eight million people displaced in Syria, along with more than four million Syrian refugees in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.\nEgypt\u2019s five million or more Copts, the Middle East\u2019s last remaining major Christian sect, are deeply worried about their future in an unstable and hostile country. Ancient minority groups like the Yazidis of Iraq are already homeless, as are many small communities of Assyrian, Nestorian and Chaldean Christians from northern Iraq.\nWhile Yemenis have yet to abandon their homeland in substantial numbers, their plight is worsening daily amid wartime shortages of food and medicine and persistent bombardment by Saudi warplanes. Yemen is not much farther away from Europe than Eritrea, now the biggest source of African refugees, just across the Red Sea, and at some 25 million it is as populous as Afghanistan.\nNor is it only the Middle East and North Africa that European leaders need to consider. The Gallup Poll, based on data compiled from more than 450,000 interviews in 151 nations from 2009 to 2011, found that in Nigeria, which already has double the population of Germany, 40 percent of people would emigrate to the West if they could. And the lesson of 2015 \u2014 for them and much of the world \u2014 is that they can.\nWhile the flow of migrants to Europe this year already represents the biggest influx from outside the Continent in modern history, many experts warn that the mass movement may continue and even increase \u2014 possibly for years to come. \u201cWe are talking about millions of potential refugees trying to reach Europe, not thousands,\u201d  Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said in a recent Twitter posting.\nMany of the migrants are fleeing persecution, poverty, ethnic and religious strife and war, but these afflictions are often symptoms of more profound changes.\nIn the Middle East and Africa, borders drawn by Ottoman dynasts and European colonialists are breaking down as the autocratic Arab states that enforced a grim peace for generations continue to implode. \nAs traditional lines of authority break down, militant groups like the Islamic State and Boko Haram, in Nigeria, seek to fill the vacuum while minority sects and ethnic groups suffer unspeakable treatment at their hands.\nClimate change, too, is roiling societies across the Middle East and Africa. Syria was in the grip of a prolonged drought when war broke out, and large areas of sub-Saharan Africa are becoming uninhabitable. With rising sea levels, a single typhoon in the Bay of Bengal could drive millions of Bangladeshis from their homes in low-lying coastal areas and render that land uninhabitable, too.\nEurope has spawned mass movements of refugees in the not-too-distant past \u2014 700,000 from the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1993, 1.1 million from Eastern Europe as the Iron Curtain was torn down in 1989 \u2014 but what is new now is not just the scale of the arrivals, in such large numbers over such a short period of time. It is also the sheer number and variety of problem places they are leaving behind.\nMany migrants are from countries where the West has tried to intervene and failed spectacularly \u2014 Iraq and Afghanistan, in particular.\nThere are now some two million Iraqi refugees, many bound for Europe. Among them are people like Muhammad Basher, a young Kurdish doctor from Iraq, who took his life savings of $2,000 and had spent nearly all of it by the time he reached the Croatian border \u2014 $1,200 just for a seat in a rubber dinghy on a dangerous sea crossing to Greece.\n\u201cBetter to die quickly there, than slowly in Iraq,\u201d he said.\nSayid Karim Hashimi, 23, a native of Kunduz, was among the Afghans recently crossing the border out of Serbia.\n\u201cThere is no future in Afghanistan,\u201d he said.\nLibya represents another failed intervention, by the French and British, with American support. Although few Libyans have been prompted to join the exodus, the chaos in their country has made it easier than ever before for other African migrants to flee to Europe through northern Africa.\nWhile most of the migrants have been from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, those who came through villages like this last summer could have arrived from almost anywhere. \nTwo women from Haiti and a young girl, the daughter of one of them, passed through in early October, according to officials here representing the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. They had flown to Turkey from Haiti, then joined smugglers\u2019 routes through the Balkans.\nOthers come from places like Eritrea, where young men are fleeing a brutal dictatorship that offers them the prospect of a lifetime of unpaid military service, and little else. Some are escaping civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo or poverty in nations like Gambia or Senegal. Many, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, are motivated by elemental problems like spreading desertification. Others are looking for economic opportunity.\nIbrahim Isahaq, 18, from Ghana, was among those migrants who came through Serbia in October, attracted by news of how easy passage had become. He was simply fleeing a family feud over a disputed inheritance. Youssou, 25, from Senegal, said his father was a commander in the little-known Casamance separatist movement, but he seemed more interested in business prospects in Europe.\n\u201cThere was no life for me in Senegal,\u201d he said.\nWhile the migrant crisis has inspired a backlash among Europe\u2019s right-wing nationalist parties, particularly in the East, authorities say the problem is still manageable. \u201cWe need to keep our perspective on the numbers,\u201d said Alexander Betts, who heads the Refugee Studies Center at Oxford University. \n\u201cIf Lebanon can host one million Syrians, despite being the size of Maryland, a region the size of Europe should be able to host millions.\u201d\nEven in the four European Union member countries that initially opposed a modest 120,000-migrant per nation resettlement quota \u2014 Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary \u2014 voices were raised in support of the migrants, who were to be distributed across the 28-member bloc. Though a quota system has yet to take full effect, a recent appeal, signed by former presidents and prime ministers and other prominent Europeans, many from those four countries, called on their countries to abandon their hostility to the migrants and remember their own recent past.\nThat might be a hard sell, however, in a Europe already preoccupied with terrorist recruitment among disaffected Muslim populations from earlier, much smaller migrations.\n\u201cThroughout Europe, xenophobia and open racism are running rampant, and nationalist, even far-right parties are gaining ground,\u201d Joschka Fischer, the former German foreign minister, wrote recently in an article that appeared on Project Syndicate, an online news service. \n\u201cAt the same time, this is only the beginning of the crisis, because the conditions inciting people to flee their homelands will only worsen. And the E.U., many of whose members have the world\u2019s largest and best-equipped welfare systems, appears to be overwhelmed by it \u2014 politically, morally and administratively.\u201d\nThose stresses pose a challenge for the future, experts say, because the flow is unlikely to ebb anytime soon.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this wave can stop,\u201d said Sonja Licht of the International Center for Democratic Transition. \u201cIt can maybe from time to time be somewhat less intensive, we simply have to prepare. The global north must be prepared that the global south is on the move, the entire global south. This is not just a problem for Europe but for the whole world.\u201d",

    "text": "Former U.N. President and Chinese Billionaire Are Accused in Graft Scheme\n2015-10-06T13:43:12.000Z\nA former top United Nations official and a billionaire real estate developer from the Chinese territory of Macau were accused on Tuesday of engaging in a broad corruption scheme, according to federal prosecutors in Manhattan.\nThe former president of the United Nations General Assembly, John W. Ashe, a diplomat from Antigua, was one of six people identified in a criminal complaint outlining a bribery scheme that involved more than $1 million in payments from sources in China for assistance in real estate deals and other business interests.\nThe case is highly embarrassing to the United Nations, which had vowed to act with greater transparency and accountability after past scandals. Mr. Ashe is the most senior diplomat to be accused of such graft, and it remains unclear whether the case will prompt the organization to review how it elects leaders of the General Assembly. It is different from the oil-for-food program scandal in Iraq a decade ago, when an independent commission found widespread abuse.\nSecretary General Ban Ki-moon said through his spokesman that he was \u201cshocked and deeply saddened\u201d at the accusations of corruption.\n\u201cThey go to the heart of the integrity of the legislative process of the United Nations,\u201d the spokesman, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, said on Tuesday.\nThe complaint alleges a broad pattern of corruption on the part of Mr. Ashe, 61, who was accused of using the bribes to support a lavish lifestyle: spending $59,000 on hand-tailored suits in Hong Kong in 2013 and 2014, buying two Rolex watches in 2014 for $54,000, and later that year paying $40,000 to lease a new BMW X5.\nHe also bought a membership at a South Carolina country club for $69,000, and solicited money to construct a $30,000 basketball court at his home in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., according to the complaint.\n\u201cIf proven, today\u2019s charges will confirm that the cancer of corruption that plagues too many local and state governments infects the United Nations as well,\u201d Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said at a news conference. He said that the investigation was still in its early stages, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a lot of things, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you would see other people charged.\u201d\nThe charges represent a widening of the investigation of Ng Lap Seng, a developer based in Macau who was arrested by customs officials in New York last month and charged with bringing $4.5 million into the United States under false pretenses.\nMr. Ashe, according to the complaint, took payments from Mr. Ng and used \u201chis official position to obtain for Ng potentially lucrative investments in Antigua.\u201d In one instance, $200,000 was wired into Mr. Ashe\u2019s private bank account in exchange for a foreign trip in 2014 in his official capacity, to discuss a conference center that Mr. Ng wanted to develop for the United Nations.\nThe campaign to construct a permanent center in Macau seems to have started as early as February 2012, when Mr. Ashe, in his capacity as the ambassador to the United Nations from Antigua and Barbuda, proposed a \u201cpermanent expo and meeting centre\u201d to be created with help from Mr. Ng\u2019s company, the Sun Kian Ip Group of China. \nMr. Ashe asked the secretary general to circulate such a proposal to the General Assembly. The proposal had the backing of several other countries \u2014 including Bangladesh and Kenya \u2014 and Mr. Ashe\u2019s letter said that the \u201cSun Kian Ip Group of China has welcomed the initiative and will serve as the representative for the implementation of the Permanent Expo and Meeting Centre.\u201d\nSince then, neither the General Assembly nor the secretary general\u2019s office seem to have taken any action on the proposal.\nBut Mr. Ng has been generous to the United Nations. In May, his foundation gave the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation $1.5 million, in part to host a conference in Macau in late August to discuss cooperation among countries of the global south. \nJohn W. Ashe, a former president of the United Nations General Assembly, was named in a complaint detailing a corruption scheme that involved more than $1 million in payments from sources in China for real estate deals and other interests.\nAt that session, several envoys spoke of the need to build a United Nations center there; the office later issued a news release endorsing a permanent center in Macau: \u201cParticipants at the Forum urged the creation of a permanent expo through a substantial public-private partnership.\u201d Mr. Dujarric said the secretary general did not attend the session, but sent a message.\nMr. Ashe, by then, had no role at the United Nations General Assembly. His term as its president lasted from September 2013 to September 2014. He stepped down from his post as ambassador later that year.\nMr. Ashe was arrested on Tuesday morning at his home in Dobbs Ferry; he was not charged in the bribery scheme but was charged with two counts of filing false federal tax returns. The five other defendants, including Francis Lorenzo, the deputy permanent representative to the United Nations for the Dominican Republic, were charged with bribery and conspiracy counts.\n\u201cAshe made it very clear in emails and documents that he could use his access to the prime minister and other government officials to set up meetings and promote contracts with businessmen who were willing to pay,\u201d said Diego Rodriguez, the head of the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nMr. Bharara did not address why Mr. Ashe, a lawful permanent resident of the United States, was charged only with tax violations and not bribery, like the other defendants. He did say that he did not expect claims of diplomatic immunity to succeed in the case.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think any immunity issues would arise in such a way to prevent the current charges, and obviously we do all that in consultation with the State Department,\u201d he said.\nA federal magistrate judge, James C. Francis IV, set a $1 million bond for Mr. Ashe, and said he would be subject to home detention and electronic monitoring, and must surrender his travel documents. It was unclear how quickly Mr. Ashe could post bond.\nProsecutors had sought his detention, saying he posed \u201ca severe risk of flight,\u201d while Mr. Ashe\u2019s lawyer, Robert F. Van Lierop, argued that the charges were only allegations, which his client intended to fight. \u201cI expect him to be fully acquitted,\u201d Mr. Van Lierop said after the hearing.\u00a0The five other defendants were all ordered held pending further proceedings.\u00a0\nMr. Ng was being held without bail on a conspiracy charge filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, accusing him of lying to Customs and Border Protection officials about the purpose of the cash he brought into the country over a two-year period.\nMr. Ng was named in a 1998 Democratic Party financing scandal in which he was accused of wiring more than $1 million from accounts in Macau and Hong Kong to bank accounts in Washington and Arkansas, then the home of former President Bill Clinton.\nMr. Ng denied any wrongdoing in that case. \nMr. Ng\u2019s personal assistant, Jeff C. Yin, was arrested at the same time as his boss, charged with the same offense, and is also being held without bail. He is also named in the criminal complaint released on Tuesday.\nAccording to the complaint, Mr. Ashe took some $200,000 from two other defendants, Shiwei Yan and Heidi Hong Piao, in exchange for attending a conference in China in his official capacity as president of the General Assembly. Ms. Yan and Ms. Piao were also charged with money laundering conspiracy.\nAlex Spiro, a lawyer for Mr. Ng, said in a statement on Tuesday that Mr. Ng has \u201ccommitted no crime.\u201d Lawyers for Mr. Lorenzo, Mr. Yin, Ms. Yan and Ms. Piao had no comment.\nMr. Ashe named the two women official advisers on economic matters to the office of the prime minister of Antigua. In an email sent with the letters of appointment, Mr. Ashe stated, \u201cI believe these complete the outstanding requests that were made to me.\u201d\nThe current president of the General Assembly, Mogens Lykketoft of Denmark, addressing reporters in the afternoon, pledged to cooperate with authorities.\n\u201cThe United Nations and its representatives should be held to the highest standards of transparency and ethics,\u201d he said. He added, \u201cCorruption has no place in the United Nations or anywhere else.\u201d",

    "text": "Jungle Camp in Malaysia Yields Graves and Signs of Migrant Abuse\n2015-05-26T19:23:30.000Z\nBUKIT WANG BURMA, Malaysia \u2014 Among the debris of wood, bamboo and plastic tarpaulin at an abandoned camp in the dense jungle here lies a coffin-size cage made from sticks tied together with rusted barbed wire. Next to it, an enclosure that could have held scores of people also bristles with barbed wire. And over a ridge, the police have started unearthing bodies from shallow graves.\nThe police in Malaysia have said little about the grim discoveries at desolate camps like this one on a hillside near the country\u2019s border with Thailand. But what was left behind here suggests that the camps were busy holding stations for migrants under the control of ruthless, sophisticated human smuggling rings.\nThe Malaysian government on Tuesday took reporters on a two-hour trek through a buzzing jungle to view this camp in the state of Perlis, in the country\u2019s far north. It is one of several where investigators say they have identified a total of 139 graves believed to hold the bodies of migrants, including members of the Rohingya minority fleeing religious persecution in Myanmar.\nNot far across the border, in Thailand\u2019s Songkhla Province, the Thai authorities have uncovered graves containing at least 36 more bodies.\nA crackdown in southern Thailand on these smuggling networks is believed to have set off the regionwide crisis this month in which thousands of migrants were abandoned by smugglers and stranded at sea. More than 3,000 have landed in Malaysia and Indonesia in recent weeks, and the International Organization for Migration appealed on Tuesday for $26 million to help them.\nMuhammad Bahar, a detective with the police in Perlis, said officers had exhumed a body on Tuesday from one of 37 primitive graves discovered near this camp in Bukit Wang Burma. He said it was too early to draw any conclusions about the identity of the dead person or the cause of death.\n\u201cAnother forensic team will confirm later,\u201d he said, standing near the exhumation site, where other officers worked with shovels and hoes. \u201cWe have to let forensic do their job.\u201d\nBut the scene appeared to add weight to reports that migrants transported across Southeast Asia by smugglers had suffered extreme brutality. The lower part of the camp was dominated by what appeared to be a holding pen made from wooden poles crisscrossed by barbed wire. On higher ground, a dilapidated watchtower looked over the settlement, which also had a trash pit and a large water tank, suggesting that the site could have been used to hold hundreds of people.\nThose who have studied human smuggling said the syndicates often supplemented their smuggling operations with ransom and extortion schemes. Relatives of those smuggled into Thailand are often called and ordered to transfer large sums in exchange for the freedom of their relatives, according to advocates for the migrants and the migrants themselves.\n\u201cThey beat you and tell you to call home and come up with the money,\u201d Jeffrey Labovitz, chief of mission at the International Organization for Migration in Thailand, said by telephone. \u201cIt\u2019s a ruthless business mentality.\u201d\nThe smuggling rings demand payments as high as $3,000 to release their clients, who are sometimes starved and abused to put pressure on relatives to come up with the money, according to Alistair D. B. Cook, a research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\u201cExtortion isn\u2019t the word for it,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cThe alternative is death. It\u2019s worse than extortion.\u201d\nThe camps are out of the way, but they sit along a major trading route that links Singapore and the Malaysian peninsula with the rest of mainland Southeast Asia. The route is a hub of legitimate trade as well as a transit point for illicit drugs, smuggled fuel and Malaysians seeking libertine pleasures in freewheeling Thailand.\nThe Malaysian home minister, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, said on Tuesday that investigators were examining whether forestry rangers in the densely wooded border region had colluded with smugglers, according to Bernama, the Malaysian news agency. Some forestry officers have already been detained, he said.\nKhalid Abu Bakar, the inspector general of the police in Malaysia, said Monday that the camps were believed to have been occupied since 2013 and that two of them were abandoned only two to three weeks ago, according to Bernama. He said the public disclosure of the suspected graves \u201cproves that the Malaysian government is transparent and not hiding any information involving human trafficking issues.\u201d\nAbout 25,000 migrants left Myanmar and Bangladesh on rickety smugglers\u2019 boats in the first three months of 2015, according to a United Nations estimate.\nBut some advocates for Rohingya migrants said the abuses had been largely ignored.\n\u201cWe hear about families waiting for people to come here who they never hear about again,\u201d Zafar Ahmad bin Abdul Ghani, the president of the Myanmar Ethnic Rohingyas Human Rights Organization Malaysia, said in a telephone interview from Kuala Lumpur.\n\u201cMalaysia needs to investigate Rohingya who have died on the border with Thailand,\u201d he added. \u201cMaybe they also need to investigate the enforcement departments in Malaysia. Have they done enough to enforce and investigate? How can the traffickers cross the border in this area?\u201d\nIn Wang Kelian, a nearby settlement of paddy fields, some residents said the migrants sometimes appeared and begged for food or cash before moving on by foot. \u201cWe know they come through to Malaysia for work, for safety, for family,\u201d said a resident who gave only her family name, Halimah. \u201cBut it is shocking for us, too, to learn about how they are treated in the camps.\u201d\nMalaysian officials have said little about how these camps and smuggling networks could have existed, undisturbed, for years. But investigators on the Thai side of the border say the camps operated with the help of local officials, Thai law enforcement officers and residents. Nearly 70 Thai police officers have been transferred from their posts as part of the crackdown.\nLast week, a former government official whom the authorities described as a kingpin in the smuggling operation surrendered to the Thai police. The former official, Patchuban Angchotipan, who had evaded capture for more than a week, is the former chairman of the provincial administration in Satun, a Thai province where smuggling camps were discovered this month.\nIn what the police say is a measure of the money involved in smuggling, the authorities froze more than $2 million of Mr. Patchuban\u2019s assets. Among other businesses, Mr. Patchuban owned companies that ran speedboat and ferry services in the Andaman Sea, which were believed to have been used to transport migrants.\nMr. Patchuban, who is known by his nickname, Ko Tong, has been charged with colluding in human smuggling, illegal detention and abduction for ransom.\nIn an interview on Tuesday, Police Gen. Aek Angsananont, the deputy commissioner of Thailand\u2019s police force, said the smuggling rings generally smuggled Bangladeshi and ethnic Rohingya migrants on boats into Thailand and brought them over land to Malaysia.\nGeneral Aek, who is leading the investigation into the smuggling rings, said the police had obtained arrest warrants for 77 suspects. Of those, 46 have been arrested, he said, and the rest are \u201con the run.\u201d\nHe added that the crackdown had the support of the highest levels of Thailand\u2019s military government and that the police were \u201cclearing the mountains\u201d along the Malaysian border of smuggling operations.\nThe crackdown began this month when a Rohingya man filed a complaint at a police station in southern Thailand, saying his nephew was being held for ransom. The police investigating the case discovered the mass graves on the Thai side of the border.\nThe authorities have not disclosed how the people found in the graves died, and some bodies were so badly composed that the cause of death may never be known. A doctor at Songklanagarind Hospital in southern Thailand said that medical workers were close to completing autopsies and that the police would soon reveal the results.\nIncreasingly, the Rohingya leaving Myanmar have included women and children. And clues amassed by the Malaysian police from the border camps suggested that children had been among the inmates. Among photos of items recovered from the camps, one showed a pair of mildewed, pink children\u2019s sandals.",

    "text": "South Asian-American Men Balance Tradition and Modernity to Find a Bride\n2015-05-22T21:03:54.000Z\nThe Urdu phrase \u201cbus bohot hogiya hay\u201d sends chills down Umair Khan\u2019s spine.\nRoughly translated as \u201cenough already,\u201d it\u2019s something Mr. Khan, 34, a Manhattan lawyer, has heard uttered by his mother, his aunt and their Pakistani-American friends on several occasions, lately with increasing exasperation. The frustration stems from Mr. Khan\u2019s inability to find a suitable mate.\nLike many second-generation South Asian-Americans, Mr. Khan finds himself walking a fine line between paying respect to traditional matchmaking practices extolled by an older generation and embracing more contemporary methods of finding an appropriate life partner.\nHis search has involved, among other things, being fixed up by \u201cRishta aunties\u201d suggested by a friend and a friend of his mother, meeting women at networking events and suggestions he try online dating.\n\u201cIt\u2019s exhausting,\u201d said Mr. Khan, deputy counsel for litigation in the New York Public Advocate\u2019s office. \u201cWhen you\u2019re set up, there\u2019s another dimension to that meeting. You\u2019ve got to give a report when it\u2019s over. That\u2019s the tricky part. How do you tell the referring authority you\u2019re not interested without offending them?\u201d\nWithin many immigrant communities, more attention seems to focus on marrying off daughters, but it is often the sons who bear the weight of family expectations when it comes to picking a mate.\nOvert pressure may be lessening, and outright arranged marriages are the exception rather than the rule, but the love lives of those whose families are from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh may nevertheless be subject to a good deal of scrutiny and occasional intervention. And the men themselves are becoming more demanding.\n\u201cWhen it comes to men, whether they have good looks or a good degree, they all want a beautiful girl with an M.D. degree in hand,\u201d said Afshan Qadir, who was born in Pakistan and is now a professional matchmaker in Newark, Del., who specializes in matches for South Asian Muslims living in the United States. \u201cThen the parents weigh in, and they say, \u2018We want a daughter-in-law who can make very good food for us.\u2019 But she doesn\u2019t have time to learn to cook if she\u2019s getting her professional degree.\u201d\nMs. Qadir blames the South Asian culture for these unrealistic expectations. \u201cMen have more power,\u201d she said. Problems also arise when the expectations of the parents don\u2019t match the preferences of their sons, according to Ms. Qadir, who said that more than half her client base is made up of the parents rather than the offspring.\nThe degree of parental involvement depends on how closely a family holds to tradition.\nTake Dharmesh Darji, a 20-year-old from Washington Township, N.J., who suddenly found himself married during a family trip to India this year.\nThe intent of the trip was to seal the marriage that had been arranged for Mr. Darji\u2019s 21-year-old sister, Payal. But once they were there, his parents started making plans for him.\nBy the time they left India, papers had been signed confirming Mr. Darji\u2019s marriage to a woman he had spoken with only briefly at his sister\u2019s wedding ceremony.\n\u201cI was shocked when I found out,\u201d said Mr. Darji, a junior at Rutgers University in Camden, N.J. \u201cMy dad sat me down and told me that this is what they were thinking about. I knew nothing about it.\u201d\nThough he didn\u2019t spend much time with his new bride, a dental student who is also just 20, Mr. Darji is hoping things will work out when she joins him in the United States next year, since, as he pointed out, he doesn\u2019t have much choice in the matter.\n\u201cIt\u2019s either the girl or the parents,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I were to bring home my own girl, I\u2019d lose my family.\u201d\nOn the other hand, Ashwin Mathur, 21, of Great Falls, Va., said that his parents had been very relaxed about the dating choices he and his siblings have made. \u201cThey say, \u2018You guys are American, you do what you want,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Mathur, a junior at New York University whose parents were acquainted before being formally united in India more than 30 years ago. In choosing a mate, Mr. Mathur said he\u2019s looking for someone both he and his family like.\nAs it happens, Mr. Mathur is now dating an Indian woman from London who is also studying at N.Y.U. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to get along with a girl of Indian descent,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018I get you and you get me.\u2019 There\u2019s a comfort level.\u201d\nAmong the earlier generation of South Asian immigrants coming to the United States, the drive to succeed, in many cases, trumped the drive to marry.\nOmar Qureshi came to the United States from Pakistan after President Lyndon B. Johnson loosened immigration policies for students and young professionals in the 1960s.\nMr. Qureshi, a history teacher at the Brearley School in Manhattan, said he felt little marital pressure from his parents, who were more concerned that he secure a good education. \u201cWe used to joke that our mother was completely incompetent when it came to marrying her sons off,\u201d said Mr. Qureshi, who remains single at 49, while his two younger brothers are both married.\nThough he may not have felt pressure from his family to marry within his culture or religion, Mr. Qureshi, like Mr. Mathur, has internalized his own expectations.\n\u201cI find Pakistani women incredibly attractive, but I don\u2019t really meet any,\u201d Mr. Qureshi said. \u201cMost of my friends are American, but I never thought of marrying someone who wasn\u2019t Pakistani.\u201d\nMr. Qureshi\u2019s odds are about to change in his favor. This summer, he will leave New York and move to Pakistan to teach at a university there. Though he said meeting a woman was not a primary motivation for his move, he acknowledged \u201cif I find someone, that would be great.\u201d\nJamila Akhter, a mother of three grown children, has noticed that the family influence has lessened among her friends, as fewer second-generation South Asian couples are living in their parents\u2019 homes in her community in North Brunswick, N.J.\n\u201cTraditionally, it was not about two individuals, but about two families coming together,\u201d Ms. Akhter said. \u201cFor some families, when they first came to this country, the parents might be stricter with their oldest kids. So some of those kids didn\u2019t get married, or got divorced, or ended up in unhappy marriages. Then the parents ended up being more lenient with the younger kids.\u201d\nThat said, she couldn\u2019t resist offering to help her son, Assad, after he reached 30 and still hadn\u2019t settled down. She asked friends to refer possible candidates and ended up hiring a traditional Rishta auntie. In the end, her son found his future wife through a professional networking event. And how helpful was the Rishta auntie?\n\u201cNot so much,\u201d Ms. Akhter said. \u201cShe criticized my son a lot. She\u2019d say: \u2018What is he looking for? That was such a nice girl I introduced him to.\u2019 \u201d\nBeyond the busybody neighborhood \u201cauntie,\u201d the job of professional matchmaker has become big business.\nJasbina Ahluwalia, a lawyer turned matchmaker, puts a contemporary twist on an old practice, offering online dating support, dating coaching and customized mate searches for South Asians in the United States and abroad. She charges $375 for a 90-minute personal assessment, about $4,000 for online support and $8,500 to $50,000 for matchmaking, she said.\nMs. Ahluwalia, a second-generation Indian-American, says working with today\u2019s South Asian-American men is difficult at times. \u201cThey are so successful, and tend to be very busy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe challenge is getting them to make time. I tell them, \u2018We can find you great women, but we can\u2019t have the relationship for you.\u2019 \u201d\nAs with many demographic subsets, there are numerous online mating sites geared to the South Asian and Muslim communities, including salaamlove.com, singlemuslim.com and the India-based shaadi.com, which calls itself \u201cthe world\u2019s largest matrimonial service\u201d and claims 3.2 million successful pairings.\nWhile embracing contemporary technology, these sites also pay homage to traditional customs. On singlemuslim.com, in addition to a vast database of participants\u2019 profiles and photos, there is advice, with recommendations like: \u201cPraise your wife when she pleases you and show gratitude for all she does for you.\u201d\nThough it\u2019s been suggested by many friends, Mr. Khan has yet to turn to online dating. If he were to create a profile, he said, his headline would read something close to this: \u201cPart Tandoori Chicken, Part Apple Pie.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy space to be in,\u201d Mr. Khan said, \u201cwhen you\u2019re trying to bring in culture, and faith. To find someone with strong beliefs and good values, but also someone who gets it, and is smart. Maybe the checklist is too long.\u201d",

    "text": "Chinese Textile Mills Are Now Hiring in Places Where Cotton Was King\n2015-08-02T10:00:24.000Z\nINDIAN LAND, S.C. \u2014 Twenty-five years ago, Ni Meijuan earned $19 a month working the spinning machines at a vast textile factory in the Chinese city of Hangzhou.\nNow at the Keer Group\u2019s cotton mill in South Carolina, which opened in March, Ms. Ni is training American workers to do the job she used to do.\n\u201cThey\u2019re quick learners,\u201d Ms. Ni said after showing two fresh recruits how to tease errant wisps of cotton from the machines\u2019 grinding gears. \u201cBut they have to learn to be quicker.\u201d\nOnce the epitome of cheap mass manufacturing, textile producers from formerly low-cost nations are starting to set up shop in America. It is part of a blurring of once seemingly clear-cut boundaries between high- and low-cost manufacturing nations that few would have predicted a decade ago.\nTextile production in China is becoming increasingly unprofitable after years of rising wages, higher energy bills and mounting logistical costs, as well as new government quotas on the import of cotton.\nAt the same time, manufacturing costs in the United States are becoming more competitive. In Lancaster County, where Indian Land is located, Keer has found residents desperate for work, even at depressed wages, as well as access to cheap and abundant land and energy and heavily subsidized cotton.\nPoliticians, from the county to the state to the federal government, have raced to ply Keer with grants and tax breaks to bring back manufacturing jobs once thought to be lost forever.\nThe prospect of a sweeping Pacific trade agreement that is led by the United States, and excludes China, is also driving Chinese yarn companies to gain a foothold here, lest they be shut out of the lucrative American market.\nKeer\u2019s $218 million mill spins yarn from raw cotton to sell to textile makers across Asia. While Keer still spins much of its yarn in China, importing the raw cotton from America, that is slowly changing.\n\u201cThe reasons for Keer coming here? Incentives, land, the environment, the workers,\u201d Zhu Shanqing, Keer\u2019s chairman, said on a recent trip to the United States.\n\u201cIn China, the whole yarn manufacturing industry is losing money,\u201d he added. \u201cIn America, it\u2019s very different.\u201d\nSince Beijing and Washington resumed trade relations in the early 1970s, the United States has mostly run a huge trade deficit, as Americans consumed billions of dollars in cheap electronics, apparel and other Chinese goods.\nBut surging labor and energy costs in China are eroding its competitiveness in manufacturing. According to the Boston Consulting Group, manufacturing wages adjusted for productivity have almost tripled in China over the last decade, to an estimated $12.47 an hour last year from $4.35 an hour in 2004.\nIn the United States, manufacturing wages adjusted for productivity have risen less than 30 percent since 2004, to $22.32 an hour, according to the consulting firm. And the higher wages for American workers are offset by lower natural gas prices, as well as inexpensive cotton and local tax breaks and subsidies.\nToday, for every $1 required to manufacture in the United States, Boston Consulting estimates that it costs 96 cents to manufacture in China. Yarn production costs in China are now 30 percent higher than in the United States, according to the International Textile Manufacturers Federation.\n\u201cEverybody believed that China would always be cheaper,\u201d said Harold L. Sirkin, a senior partner at Boston Consulting. \u201cBut things are changing even faster than anyone imagined.\u201d\nRising costs in China are causing a shift of some types of manufacturing to lower-cost countries like Bangladesh, India and Vietnam. In many cases, the exodus has been led by the Chinese themselves, who have aggressively moved to set up manufacturing bases elsewhere.\nIn recent years, the United States has started to get more attention from that exodus. From 2000 to 2014, Chinese companies invested $46 billion on new projects and acquisitions in the United States, much of it in the last five years, according to a report published in May by the Rhodium Group, a New York research firm.\nThe Carolinas are now home to at least 20 Chinese manufacturers, including Keer and Sun Fiber, which set up a polyester fiber plant in Richburg, S.C., last year. And in Lancaster County, negotiations are underway with two more textile companies, from Taiwan and the Chinese mainland.\n\u201cI never thought the Chinese would be the ones bringing textile jobs back,\u201d said Keith Tunnell, president of the Lancaster County Economic Development Corporation, who helped put together subsidies for Keer estimated at about $20 million, including infrastructure grants, revenue bonds and tax credits.\nThe inner workings of Keer\u2019s factory in Lancaster County help demonstrate why yarn can now be produced for such a low cost in the United States and point to the kind of capital-intensive manufacturing that could thrive again in America.\nInside the 230,000-square-foot spinning plant, giant machines help clean the seeds and dirt from the cotton and send the fluff into carding machines that assemble the cotton into thick, long ropes of fiber. Workers then feed the ropes into machines that spin the cotton into spools of yarn or thread.\nThe work is highly automated, with the factory\u2019s 32 production lines churning out about 85 tons of yarn a day. Even when Keer opens a second factory next year, it will hire just 500 workers, a fraction of the thousands of workers who toiled at cotton mills across the South for much of the 19th and 20th centuries \u2014 a big reason Keer is able to keep costs down.\nThe spools of yarn are then shipped through the port of Charleston to textile and apparel manufacturers across Asia. Keer also hopes to sell to apparel manufacturers in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, where many nations enjoy privileged access to the American market as part of separate trading pacts \u2014 as long as the yarn is made in a member country.\nSheng Lu, an apparel and textiles expert at the University of Rhode Island, said the high capital intensity of modern yarn-spinning meant that American mills were becoming increasingly competitive.\n\u201cCommon sense says that the U.S. imports textiles and apparel from China,\u201d he said. \u201cNow some of that is reversed.\u201d\nBut cutting and sewing clothes, he said, still relies so much on labor that \u201cit\u2019s just impossible for the U.S. to be competitive.\u201d\nA look at the (mostly) rising costs to manufacture goods by country and a breakdown of the cost to make yarn.\nInvestment in American textiles has not come just from China. Last year, the ShriVallabh Pittie Group, a leading textile manufacturer in India, broke ground on a $70 million factory in Sylvania, Ga., the area\u2019s first new manufacturing plant in four decades. And Santana Textiles, a large Brazilian denim manufacturer, announced in 2012 that it would open a spinning, dyeing and weaving facility in Edinburg, Tex., though full-scale production has been delayed.\n\u201cThe whole textile world is looking at us,\u201d Vinod Pittie, chairman of the ShriVallabh Pittie Group, said at the factory\u2019s groundbreaking ceremony, predicting that the success of the venture would draw other entrepreneurs to open plants in Georgia.\nFor residents of South Carolina, Keer\u2019s arrival could not have come soon enough. A generation of weavers and spinners lost their jobs when Springs Industries, which once ran some of the world\u2019s biggest cotton mills in the city of Lancaster, closed its last plant in 2007, selling off its machines to a company in Brazil.\nThe global economic crisis hit soon afterward. By June 2009, Lancaster County\u2019s unemployment rate had reached 18.6 percent.\n\u201cThey shut them down one by one,\u201d said Donnie R. Gordon, who spent 17 years weaving cotton at Springs Industries until he was laid off in the 1990s. He now works in maintenance for the Lancaster County school system. \u201cYou could make good money at the mills, but those jobs just went away.\u201d\nBut shrinking manufacturing jobs have spurred a willingness in places like Lancaster County to work for lower pay, making them increasingly attractive production bases. Global manufacturers have also been drawn to so-called right-to-work states like South Carolina, where there is little unionization.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to like it here,\u201d said Enabel Perez, a former apparel factory worker and one of Ms. Ni\u2019s trainees. Ms. Perez said she had jumped at Keer\u2019s call for workers, an event welcomed in Lancaster County with a segment on the evening news.\nKeer\u2019s gamble in America is not without risks. The strong dollar, for one, has added to the costs of producing in the United States. Water shortages in Arizona and California could also threaten cotton production, as well as jeopardize already endangered cotton subsidies.\nThe outcome of stalled negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade agreement that leaves out China, will also affect Keer\u2019s American prospects. American negotiators are pushing for rules that would require apparel makers in member countries to use yarn from within the trade zone to enjoy tariff reductions. By producing yarn in America, Keer is hedging its bets, making sure it can continue to supply yarn to apparel manufacturers to countries like Vietnam that are within the T.P.P. trade zone.\nThen there are the cultural differences. Ms. Ni, one of 15 Chinese trainers at Keer\u2019s Indian Land plant, complained softly of American workers\u2019 occasional tardiness. In China, she said, managers can dock the pay of workers who show up late. But here, she said, she felt frustrated that she could not discipline tardy staff.\nRobbie Sowers, 44, a textile industry veteran who maintains the plant\u2019s spinning machines, called such differences minor. He said Keer managers had started giving workers six minutes\u2019 leeway before calling them late.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talent and experience here in South Carolina,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of getting used to the American way of working.\u201d\nAs she walked through the factory floor, Ms. Ni pointed to digital screens at the end of each row of spinning machines, which displayed in real time, out of a score of 100, how efficiently those machines were kept running by their operators. The screens flashed: 76, 85, 90. Experienced workers in China rarely let that number drop below 97, she said.\n\u201cThey\u2019re learning,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to be patient.\u201d",

    "text": "Elsinore in Denmark, Hamlet\u2019s \u2018Home,\u2019 Is Having a Renaissance\n2015-07-30T11:00:04.000Z\nOne afternoon last fall, I walked along the North Sea coast in search of a ghost.\nAdmittedly, the bucolic spot felt incongruously cheerful for a paranormal encounter. A low sun splayed its rays over the blue water and the majestic red brick walls of the Renaissance castle next to me. Couples with ice cream strolled around the embankment and sea gulls floated above.\nNo phantoms materialized. I was probably several centuries too late.\nFor it was there, along the ramparts of Kronborg Castle, that Hamlet, prince of Denmark, encountered the ghost of his murdered father, setting in motion the revenge story that propels what is perhaps the most famous literary work in the English language.\nA devotee of \u201cHamlet,\u201d I had taken the 45-minute train ride up the coast from Copenhagen to the town of Elsinore (called Helsingor in Denmark) to immerse myself in the Renaissance-era \u201cElsinore\u201d Castle \u2014 as Shakespeare called it \u2014 and stroll among the town\u2019s centuries-old edifices.\nBut I was also keen to witness Elsinore\u2019s recent renaissance. Though the town enjoyed centuries as a prosperous royal outpost (thanks mainly to taxes levied on foreign trade ships passing through the adjacent sound that separates Denmark from Sweden), its fortunes ebbed in the 1980s with the collapse of its shipbuilding industry. The docklands wasted away. The town\u2019s income became dependent on Swedish day-trippers, who would ferry over to buy cheap booze.\nThe last five years, however, have seen an Elsinore resurgence. Following a major municipal effort, the town now has cutting-edge cultural venues, public artworks and cultural festivals to augment its time-honored appeal.\nFrom the train station, I threaded my way past churches with green copper spires and gabled, half-timbered houses in fanciful colors \u2014 peach, mustard, sage \u2014 toward the newest attraction, the M/S Maritime Museum of Denmark.\nEverywhere, the town flaunted its nautical past. Model ships and sailor hats peeked out from boutique windows. On a wall, a mural depicted a cartoonish vision of the harbor, replete with three-masted ships, buccaneers, sailors, fishmongers and spyglass-toting explorers.\nThings took a turn for the strange along the docks, where a giant fish had been assembled from colorful plastic flotsam and jetsam, like watering cans, dish racks, garden tools and children\u2019s toys. Nearby, a silvery boy sat on a silvery rock and stared forlornly out to sea. A male counterpart to the famous Little Mermaid statue in Copenhagen, the highly polished stainless-steel statue of Han (\u201cHim\u201d in Danish) was unveiled in 2012 by Elmgreen and Dragset, a contemporary art pair known for their sometimes provocative public art installations around the world.\nA descending gangplank-like walkway brought me into the museum, which traces the seafaring history of the Danes, from the Vikings to the Maersk global shipping empire. Opened in 2013, the subterranean space is built into the U-shaped perimeter of a disused dry dock where large ships were once serviced. The design comes courtesy of the Bjarke Ingels Group (a.k.a. BIG), an envelope-pushing young Danish architectural firm that has built an impressive international portfolio and racked up abundant awards.\nThe result is an enveloping sensory experience, part nautical fun house and part time capsule. Ambling along uneven floors (which mimic being at sea) I was subsumed in cinematic music, colored lights, projected films and noises of boat horns and sea gulls. Display cases resembling old portholes and stacked chests revealed the accouterments of old-time shipboard journeys, from \u201chardtack\u201d sailor biscuits to sextants and sundials.\nThe interactive exhibits revealed something else: my unfitness for maritime life. In an ersatz old-world tattoo parlor, I stenciled the word Mor (Mother) on my forearm with a buzzing pen meant to mimic a needle. The shaky, amateurish result would have left any mother ashamed. In a soaring hall dedicated to contemporary global shipping, equipped with computer terminals and a huge projected map of seaborne transport lanes, my attempts to route a container ship from Australia to Bangladesh resulted in a half-million-dollar loss for my \u201ccompany.\u201d\nExposed as a landlubber, I consoled myself with fish and chips in the atrium-like restaurant of the Culture Yard next door. Formerly part of the town shipyard, the industrial building has been fully overhauled and outfitted with a jagged glass facade suggesting transparent origami. Today the building houses auditoriums, exhibition areas, a multimedia library and other spaces to host an annual roster of concerts, theater and cinema.\nThat evening\u2019s entertainment was provided by bands participating in the fourth edition of the Knejpe Festival, a two-night gala held in Elsinore\u2019s numerous nautical-themed bars and old-world taverns. Valorizing sea shanties and world music \u2014 Greek blues, Cuban folk, Afrobeat \u2014 the event pays homage to Elsinore\u2019s past as an international port. (Another new event, the multimedia Click Festival, looks instead to the future, exploring \u201cthe field between art, science and technology.\u201d)\n\u201cWe thought it would be a great way to tell the story of Elsinore as a maritime city,\u201d said Mikael Fock, the Knejpe Festival organizer, whom I chanced upon while waiting to enter a subterranean bar called Holger Danske. Throngs of revelers ambled unsteadily through the streets as musicians lugged instruments into various venues. \u201cThere are at least 13 traditional bars left in Elsinore,\u201d Mr. Fock said.\nWithin Holger Danske, a stony cavern, a gray-haired man and woman called Duo Visti worked a banjo and accordion, strumming and squeezing out minor-key Danish drinking songs while the boisterous crowds swallowed local Wiibroe lager.\nDown the street, a band called Klepti Klepti summoned rollicking Balkan Gypsy music that shook the walls of Hald An, a smoky tavern decorated with a faded seascape mural. Next up was My Bubba, three young Scandinavian women \u2014 one Dane, one Swede, one Icelander \u2014 in vintage-store dresses who merged their voices in high harmony while strumming and drumming jangly ditties.\n\u201cHundreds of years ago there were bars everywhere\u201d in Elsinore, said Kirsten Dalsgaard, a self-described regular of Kobenhavneren tavern, a cottage-like warren of small rooms decorated with beer steins and paintings. In a corner, Bolvaerket (wharf, in Danish), two middle-aged guys on guitar and bass, cranked out good-time rock. With the Knejpe Festival, she added, \u201cWe are trying to relive it.\u201d\n\nEventually, all paths lead to the iconic Kronborg Castle, a sober, four-sided fortress bedecked with ornate spires and scrolled architectural flourishes, a curious marriage of Lutheran restraint and Renaissance pomp.\nAn actor in period costume led my tour group through the castle rooms as he alternately narrated, re-enacted and provided background to \u201cHamlet.\u201d Assuming the role of Horatio, the prince\u2019s confidant, he shepherded us along the ramparts, into the cellars and through various stately rooms \u2014 the royal chambers, the palace chapel, the immense ballroom \u2014 while bringing the play\u2019s celebrated scenes to life.\nAfterward I chatted with the actor-guide, William Jansen, alongside the castle courtyard, where Elsinore holds its most famous festival every August. (This year\u2019s edition runs Aug. 1 to 9) A mix of performances, films and concerts, \u201cShakespeare at Hamlet\u2019s Castle\u201d has drawn some of the modern era\u2019s most celebrated actors to play the title role. Laurence Olivier, Derek Jacobi, Richard Burton, Kenneth Branagh and Jude Law are among the many greats who have held Yorick\u2019s skull on that very spot.\nNext year, Mr. Jensen said, promises especially abundant rewards for the Shakespeare faithful. As the 400th anniversary of the playwright\u2019s death and the 200th year since \u201cHamlet\u201d was first performed at Kronborg Castle \u2014 by a group of soldiers \u2014 the town is gearing up for a particularly extravagant and extensive homage.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a grand occasion\u201d Mr. Jansen said. Then he strutted across the cobblestones to welcome another group and delve again into Elsinore\u2019s past. \nSummer is perhaps the most popular season to visit, though spring and fall are also agreeable. Frequent northbound trains (rejseplanen.dk) from Copenhagen\u2019s Central Station make the roughly 45-minute journey to Elsinore. A one-way ticket is 108 Danish kroner (about $16 at 6.6 kroner to the dollar).\nClose to the train station, Madam Sprunck is a 37-room hotel (Bramstrade 5) and the town\u2019s best restaurant. The timbered, candlelit dining room recently served a hearty fish soup, robust veal nuggets in wine sauce and apple mouse with apple-chile sorbet. A three-course meal for two, without drinks, is about 750kroner. Double rooms from 995 kroner. madamsprunck.dk.\nIn addition to an exhibition center, library and concert venue, the avant-garde Culture Yard (Allegade 2; 45-49-28-37-70; kuto.dk.) houses a cafe-restaurant (open for breakfast and lunch) that serves fish and chips (89 kroner), above, flaeskesteg (roasted pork) sandwiches (95 kroner), Copenhagen microbrews and more.\nInteractive displays on centuries of seafaring fill the M/S Maritime Museum of Denmark (Ny Kronborgvej 1; 45-49-21-06-85; mfs.dk; adults, 110 kroner).\nShakespearean history lurks inside Kronborg Castle (45-49-21-30-78; kronborg.dk; admission, 90 kroner), a Unesco World Heritage site that can be visited solo or as part of a group tour, such as \u201cIntroduction to Kronborg Castle\u201d (free with paid admission) and \u201cIn Hamlet\u2019s Footsteps\u201d (50 kroner in addition to castle admission).\nSpring brings the Click Festival (clickfestival.dk), devoted to multimedia creation in various forms.\nThe long-running Hamletscenen, or Shakespeare Festival, at Hamlet\u2019s Castle (hamletscenen.dk), is a multiday August gala of Shakespearean concerts, films and performances, featuring a \u201cHamlet\u201d production.\nCome fall, the Knejpe Festival (knejpe-festival.dk) of seafaring music fills traditional local bars like Hold-An (Bjergegade 20; 45-40-42-20-59) and Holger Danske (Stengade 68; 45-49-21-14-42; holgerdanske.info).",

    "text": "Confronting Islamic Extremism\n2015-03-09T13:58:57.000Z\nRe \u201cIslam and the West at war\u201d (Feb. 17): Roger Cohen says that Islam is responsible for the ghastly right-wing Islamists. Would he draw the same conclusion when atrocities are committed by others fueled by religious certainty? Israeli soldiers killed hundreds of children last summer in Gaza. Would Mr. Cohen say there is a \u201cconflict\u201d between civilized values and Judaism? He wouldn\u2019t and he shouldn\u2019t.\nMr. Cohen dismisses the idea that Western interventions had a major role in the development of extremism. So the ravaging of Iraq and our pitting of one sect against another had nothing to do with its birth? Can we really believe that the American and Saudi flooding of Syria with religious bigots played no part in the growth of the Islamic State?\nStanley Heller, New Haven, Conn.\nThe writer is the executive director of the Middle East Crisis Committee.\nMr. Cohen\u2019s assertions serve to bolster a climate of irrational fear in which all Muslims are viewed as potential bombers or murderers. The wrongful and racist identification of terrorist acts with religion only re-creates and nurtures the specter of the Islamic terrorist.\nNorbert Ross, Nashville\nThe writer is an associate professor of anthropology at Vanderbilt University.\nMr. Cohen unfairly blames the Obama administration in his suggestion that it should have fostered \u201cthe great liberation movement that rose up in Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Syria and elsewhere. Inaction is also a policy: Nonintervention produced Syria today.\u201d What intervention should have been undertaken? How would it have made an important difference? Would it have been practicable? Should we have become involved in more wars in the region? Should we have remained in Iraq even longer and at enormous cost? How would we have aided rebels in Syria without having that aid wind up in the hands of the Islamic State?\nWilliam J. Ferrall, Guilford, Conn.\nIf Mr. Cohen is right to say that only the Arab world can resolve the problem of Islamic fundamentalism, it is somewhat contradictory to fault President Obama for not being more supportive of the Arab Spring. Many others have similarly criticized Mr. Obama without ever plausibly explaining what other steps America could have taken to successfully further the cause.\nThe Arab world is very complex and equally vexed with the West and itself. Against the background of a disastrous invasion of Iraq, it was never likely, politically or otherwise, that America would re-enter that particular fray on the ground in significant force anytime soon. That the Islamic State has emerged has as much if not more to do with the internal stresses of the Arab world than with any external factor.\nIronically, perhaps the advances that the Islamic State has made, with its attendant extreme brutalities, and in the absence of a coordinated ground counteroffensive by local and international forces, seem to be bringing about the very response that will defeat and eradicate it.\nLasting solutions can only come from the civilized Arab world, and to the extent that external help is needed its leaders must initiate and drive this. I believe Mr. Obama\u2019s caution will more likely be vindicated than condemned by history.\nNeil Russell, Hong Kong\nThe statement by the Danish prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, that \u201cwe are not in the middle of a battle between Islam and the West\u201d ignores the real possibility that the nub of the problem is indeed embedded in Islam, as suggested by the historical record and the Quran.\nWithin the first two centuries of Islam\u2019s existence, its forces conquered a region extending from the Iberian Peninsula to the Indus Valley. After John Adams and Thomas Jefferson met with Tripoli\u2019s envoy in London in 1786 concerning the seizure of American ships in the Mediterranean, they reported to John Jay: \u201cWe took the liberty to make some inquires concerning the ground of their pretensions to make war upon nations who had done them no injury. ... The Ambassador answered us, that it was founded on the laws of their Prophet, that it was written in their Koran, that all nations who should not have acknowledged their authority, were sinners; that it was their right and duty to make war upon them wherever they could be found, and to make slaves of all they could take as prisoners; and that every Mussulman who was slain in battle was sure to go to Paradise.\u201d\nConsidering the litany of events in the West that Mr. Cohen cites following 9/11, it is an abysmal failure of nerve exhibited by most in the West not to confront Islam simply because any and all discussion is deemed Islamophobic, hence unfit to be printed, or unfit to be dealt with candidly by a Western leader such as the prime minister of Denmark.\nJohn Howard Wilhelm, Ann Arbor, Mich.\nDangers of a fictional Italy\nRe \u201cItaly\u2019s criminally great TV show\u201d (Opinion, Jan. 28): Beppe Severgnini is correct in noting that \u201cGomorrah,\u201d an Italian TV series about a fictional Neapolitan crime family, might well \u201cturn into bad publicity for Naples and Italy, just as the young government of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is trying so hard to restore confidence among foreigners.\u201d But Mr. Severgnini is mistaken if he truly believes viewers are sophisticated enough to understand that \u201cGomorrah\u201d does not represent \u201call of Italy.\u201d\nOver the last two decades, Rome has made great strides in combating the Sicilian Mafia, the Camorra, the 'Ndrangheta and Sacra Corona Unita. Indeed, Italy boasts Europe\u2019s toughest anti-mob statutes. Yet the seed of Aeneas is perennially depicted in the media as the locus of loutish evil. Thanks to popular culture, both the hoi polloi and the intelligentsia have embraced the big lie that Italians and Italian-Americans are congenital criminal Neanderthals. Such anti-Italian intolerance blinds society to the mass-murdering Mexican and Colombian cartels, Israeli organized crime, Russia\u2019s Organizatsiya, the Japanese Yakuza and France\u2019s Corsican and Milieu networks.\nThat said, the success of \u201cGomorrah\u201d will enable Stefano Sollima to join the ranks of Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Chazz Palminteri and David Chase, all of whom have profited handsomely by romanticizing Mafia terrorists.\nRosario A. Iaconis, Floral Park, N.Y.\nThe writer is the chairman of the Italic Institute of America.\nBangladesh and the rule of law\nRe \u201cBangladesh on the brink\u201d (Feb. 13): Although your editorial correctly characterizes the perpetrators of violence in Bangladesh as \u201cgoons,\u201d the editorial\u2019s main message is misguided. It wrongly implies that the government\u2019s refusal to allow a caretaker government to oversee last year\u2019s elections caused an opposition-led boycott of the 2014 election and fomented violence. The caretaker government sought by the opposition Bangladesh National Party was neither democratic nor impartial in the past. After three elections under caretaker governments were called unfair by the defeated parties, including the Bangladesh National Party, the Parliament repealed it, following the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment that it was \u201cunworkable\u201d and should be abolished.\nBangladesh already has a democratic system and the government wants all parties to participate in it. Far from trying to \u201cneutralize\u201d her opponents, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is showing her commitment to the rule of law by trying to quell the rioting and arson perpetrated by opposing political parties that have claimed more than 65 lives this year.\nMohammad Ziauddin, Washington \nThe writer is the Bangladeshi ambassador to the United States.",

(Andy Webster)\n\u2018Cartel Land\u2019 (R, 1:38) In this immersive documentary, the director Matthew Heineman takes you inside two vigilante groups \u2014 one in the United States, one in Mexico \u2014 that are taking on the drug cartels. The movie pulls you in with its urgency and ghastly violence, but is frustratingly underbaked intellectually. (Dargis)\n\u2018Do I Sound Gay?\u2019 (No rating, 1:17) David Thorpe\u2019s engaging but shallow personal documentary, about gay stereotyping and body language, tiptoes into treacherous waters where it stirs up a few ripples before gracefully backing out. (Stephen Holden)\n\u2018Dope\u2019 (R, 1:45) A caper movie and a coming-of-age story, Rick Famuyiwa\u2019s exuberant, messy feature pays playful, critical tribute to the ghetto melodramas of the 1990s. Its hero, Malcolm (Shameik Moore), is a nerd navigating a world of drug dealers and racial stereotypes, which the movie both mocks and perpetuates. (A. O. Scott)\n\u2018Entourage\u2019 (R, 1:44) Naw, bro. (Scott)\n\u2605 \u2018Ex Machina\u2019 (R, 1:50) Alex Garland\u2019s slyly spooky futuristic shocker about old and new desires turns on the relationships that bind together a robot called Ava (a terrific Alicia Vikander); the software zillionaire who created her (Oscar Isaac, wonderful); and a visitor (Domhnall Gleeson) who\u2019s seriously out of his depth. (Dargis)\n\u2018Far From the Madding Crowd\u2019 (PG-13, 2:00) In this brisk adaptation of Thomas Hardy\u2019s novel, Carey Mulligan plays Bathsheba Everdene, whose efforts to manage the farm she has inherited are interrupted by the attention of three very different suitors: her stodgy neighbor (Michael Sheen), a dissolute soldier (Tom Sturridge) and a salt-of-the-earth shepherd (Matthias Schoenaerts). (Scott)\n\u2018The Gallows\u2019 (R, 1:20) A high school student dies during a school play, and 20 years later the drama department stages the same play. That\u2019s a pretty good premise for a horror movie, but the found-footage conceit in this one wears out its welcome; the jittery camera work is more annoying than scary. (Neil Genzlinger)\n\u2018Infinitely Polar Bear\u2019 (R, 1:30) In her sweet, somewhat nutty feature debut, the writer-director Maya Forbes looks back on her 1970s childhood and her father (played by the infinitely warm Mark Ruffalo), a down-and-out charmer with manic depression. Zoe Saldana co-stars as the infinitely patient wife and mom. (Dargis)\n\u2605 \u2018Inside Out\u2019 (PG, 1:42) Voiced by a cast of blue-chip comic performers (principally Amy Poehler, Bill Hader, Phyllis Smith, Lewis Black and Mindy Kaling), this Pixar gem works on one level as a workplace sitcom set in the mind of an 11-year-old girl. It\u2019s funny and visually inventive. But it also has a profound and powerful emotional resonance, as Pete Docter, the writer and director, conducts a tour of the mental life of a child on the verge of momentous changes. (Scott)\n\u2018Insidious: Chapter 3\u2019 (PG-13, 1:37) This highly profitable horror franchise \u2014 virtually devoid of gore, nudity and cursing \u2014 rolls on with this installment, which, like its antecedents, offers simple, cohesive plotting; tidy production values; effective \u201cBoo!\u201d moments; a sense of humor; and most important, the winning actress Lin Shaye as a ghost wrangler. (Webster)\n\u2018I\u2019ll See You In My Dreams\u2019 (PG-13, 1:35) To the lengthening list of well-mannered films aimed at moviegoers who have reached an age when, to quote Shakespeare, \u201cthe heyday in the blood is tame,\u201d add \u201cI\u2019ll See You In My Dreams,\u201d a modest, quietly touching portrait of an older woman radiantly embodied by Blythe Danner. (Holden)\n\u2018Jimmy\u2019s Hall\u2019 (PG-13, 1:49) \u201cJimmy\u2019s Hall\u201d could be seen as a much less ambitious addendum to its director Ken Loach\u2019s bleak, sweeping drama \u201cThe Wind the Shakes the Barley,\u201d which was set during the Irish War of Independence and won Mr. Loach the Palme d\u2019Or at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. Issues that boiled through that film are largely sidestepped in \u201cJimmy\u2019s Hall,\u201d which expresses an unswerving belief in old-fashioned, populist heroes. (Holden)\n\u2018Jurassic World\u2019 (PG-13, 2:04) There\u2019s more flab than muscle packed on this galumphing franchise reboot, which, as it lumbers from scene to scene, reminds you of what a great action god Steven Spielberg is. Too bad he didn\u2019t take the reins on this, which features Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard and digital dinos. (Dargis)\n\u2605 \u2018A Little Chaos\u2019 (R, 1:52) In the handsomely mounted period drama directed by Alan Rickman, Mr. Rickman stars as the wily French \u201cSun King\u201d Louis XIV who has just moved his court to Versailles. Here, his chief landscape architect (Matthias Schoenaerts) hires Sabine De Barra (Kate Winslet), a sturdy, guileless everyday woman, to design the Rockwork Grove, an outdoor arena-like ballroom whose completion is imperiled by court intrigue. (Holden)\n\u2605 \u2018Love & Mercy\u2019 (PG-13, 2:00) The life and music of Brian Wilson, the sonically gifted, emotionally troubled genius of the Beach Boys, is the subject of this unusually sensitive and astute biopic, directed by Bill Pohlad. Paul Dano and John Cusack give a remarkable composite performance as Wilson at two pivotal moments: in the mid-\u201960s, when he recorded \u201cPet Sounds,\u201d one of the great pop albums of the era; and 20 years later, when Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks), who would become his second wife, helped free him from the influence of his psychologist, Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti). (Scott)\n\u2605 \u2018Mad Max: Fury Road\u2019 (R, 2:00) George Miller, the Australian action maestro who directed the three earlier \u201cMad Max\u201d movies before moving on to the \u201cHappy Feet\u201d franchise, returns to roaring, squalling, high-octane form in this episode, which is both a relentless car-chase movie and a stirring feminist fable. Tom Hardy is excellent as the road-weary, haunted Max, but the movie belongs to Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa, a one-armed truck-driver turned liberator and avenger of oppressed women. (Scott)\n\u2018Mad Women\u2019 (No rating, 2:11) Jeff Lipsky serves up another film about skewed family dynamics featuring the kind of long, detailed scenes actors love. Here, Mom (Christina Starbuck) is running for local office on a wacky platform; Dad (Reed Birney) has a statutory-rape problem; and a daughter (Kelsey Lynn Stokes) ends up giving Mom an inappropriate amount of emotional support. The film is too long and oblique for most moviegoers, but Ms. Starbuck and Mr. Birney give well-honed performances. (Genzlinger)\n\u2605 \u2018Magic Mike XXL\u2019 (R, 1:55) Channing Tatum returns as Mike Lane, who temporarily steps away from his fledgling furniture business to join his stripper \u2014 sorry, \u201cmale entertainer\u201d \u2014 buddies on a mostly shirtless road trip from Tampa to Myrtle Beach. This sequel has less plot than the first \u201cMagic Mike,\u201d and a lot more skin, sex and movement. It advances a sophisticated theory of pleasure, and it\u2019s also a blast. (Scott)\n\u2018Manglehorn\u2019 (PG-13, 1:37) Al Pacino brings his brand of soulful jive to the lonely Texas locksmith of the title, playing a courtly curmudgeon who\u2019s interested in a bank teller (Holly Hunter) but hooked on a long-lost lover. The director David Gordon Green tells a familiar story of self-realization that gets a bit more groove in its step thanks to Mr. Pacino. (Nicolas Rapold)\n\u2018Max\u2019 (PG, 1:50) The story of a military dog helping a boy get the better of some small-town Texas bad guys. Hokey and sometimes jarringly violent, but hard to resist. (Scott)\n\u2018Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\u2019 (PG-13, 1:45) This story of two movie-mad Pittsburgh teenage boys who befriend a classmate with cancer could have been an earnest wallow in maudlin self-pity, and it almost is that. But the director, Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, and the screenwriter, Jesse Andrews (adapting his own young-adult novel), keep the movie loose and humorous, and the three main actors (Thomas Mann, RJ Cyler and Olivia Cooke) are pleasant, sympathetic company. (Scott)\n\u2018Minions\u2019 (PG, 1:28) The little yellow critters from the \u201cDespicable Me\u201d franchise now have a movie to call their own. The jokes are plentiful and often ticklish, visual as well as verbal, though the comedy winds down once a story and other characters (voiced by the likes of Sandra Bullock) begin to intrude. (Dargis)\n\u2018The Overnight\u2019 (R, 1:20) Bland meets bold in Patrick Brice\u2019s comedy, which dips its toe in the new sexual revolution and comes across as a skittish redo of Paul Mazursky\u2019s 1969 sex comedy, \u201cBob & Carol & Ted & Alice.\u201d Adam Scott & Taylor Schilling & Jason Schwartzman & Judith Godr\u00e8che star. (Dargis)\n\u2018Pitch Perfect 2\u2019 (PG-13, 1:50) Not perfect, but good fun all the same. The Barden Bellas return for more a cappella high jinks. Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) is in fine form, Beca (Anna Kendrick) is in good voice and there are a few new additions, notably Hailee Steinfeld. The too-busy plot is kind of beside the point, and not all of the jokes work, but it\u2019s almost impossible to see this movie without being at least a little bit uplifted. (Scott)\n\u2018San Andreas\u2019 (PG-13, 1:54) California tumbles into the sea. Dwayne Johnson saves his family. (Scott)\n\u2018Self/Less\u2019 (PG-13, 1:56) Ben Kingsley is a rich guy who pays a lot of money to occupy the body of Ryan Reynolds. That sentence makes more sense than anything else in this utterly preposterous, not entirely unenjoyable existential bio-thriller, directed by Tarsem Singh. (Scott)\n\u2018Spy\u2019 (R, 1:59) Melissa McCarthy plays Susan Cooper, a C.I.A. desk-jockey turned international super-espionage dynamo in this loose, buoyant, profane comedy, written and directed by Paul Feig. The supporting players include Jason Statham, Jude Law, Rose Byrne and Miranda Hart. They are all very funny, but Ms. McCarthy is her own best sidekick. She\u2019s a one-woman improv troupe. (Scott)\n\u2605 \u2018Tangerine\u2019 (R, 1:27) Sean Baker\u2019s fast, raucously funny and beautifully shot comedy about love and other misadventures tracks two friends, Sin-Dee Rella (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez) and Alexandra (Mya Taylor), transgender lookers with motormouths and killer gams, across a stretch of Hollywood. Here, love wins out over the smog, johns, grit and drama that\u2019s by turns hilarious and deeply felt. (Dargis)\n\u2018Tap World\u2019 (No rating, 1:12) This documentary features a lot of people enthusing about tap dancing and demonstrating their tap skills. A little less enthusing and a little more hard information would have made for a better film, but the dancing is a delight to watch. (Genzlinger)\n\u2018Ted 2\u2019 (R, 1:59) In this comedy dead zone, the director Seth MacFarlane again gives voice to the title character, a foul-mouthed stuffed toy bear, while Mark Wahlberg plays the bear\u2019s dimwitted second banana. Seriously, you can do better. (Dargis)\n\u2018Terminator Genisys\u2019 (PG-13, 2:05) Yes, he is back, because while the series thrill is lamentably long gone, franchises now apparently last forever. Arnold Schwarzenegger stars alongside Emilia Clarke and Jason Clarke. (Dargis)\n\u2605 \u2018Testament of Youth\u2019 (PG-13, 2:09) James Kent\u2019s stately screen adaptation of the British author Vera Brittain\u2019s 1933 World War I memoir evokes the march of history with a balance and restraint exhibited by few movies with such grand ambitions. Alicia Vikander, who plays Brittain, gives her character a bracing edge of intelligence and a proto-feminist attitude. (Holden)\n\u2605 \u2018What Happened, Miss Simone?\u2019 (No rating, 1:41) Liz Garbus directed this electric, bracingly urgent documentary portrait, which traces the singer Nina Simone\u2019s life from her early childhood as a piano prodigy named Eunice Waymon to her troubled years \u2014 mentally, physically, spiritually \u2014 and finally her later return to glory. (Dargis)\n\u2605 \u2018The Wolfpack\u2019 (R, 1:24) A New York story beautifully told, Crystal Moselle\u2019s astonishing documentary tells the tale of the six Angulo brothers, who metaphorically escaped from their Lower East Side apartment through their fervent love for movies. It\u2019s an unfamiliar tale, one partly distinguished by its persuasive intimacy. (Dargis)\n\u2018Woman in Gold\u2019 (PG-13, 1:47) The movie rests heavily on the squared shoulders of Helen Mirren whose real-life character, Maria Altmann, is a proud, elderly Austrian Jewish woman struggling for the possession of a priceless Gustav Klimt painting stolen by the Nazis. Her performance salvages a film that without her, would be a laborious slog down a well-trodden path. (Holden)\nFilm Series\nJean-Claude Carri\u00e8re: Writing the Impossible  (Tuesdays) Any career that involves writing for Jacques Tati, Nicole Kidman and the romantic pairing of Charlotte Rampling and a chimpanzee would benefit from a taste for the surreal. Luckily, Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re has a gourmand\u2019s appetite for the odd, and with more than 50 years\u2019 worth of credits, there\u2019s plenty for the French Institute Alliance Fran\u00e7aise to choose from. (If only there were room for the five-hour adaptation of \u201cThe Mahabharata\u201d he did with Peter Brook.) This nine-week series continues this week with \u201cMay Fools\u201d (1990), directed by Louis Malle. (Through July 28.) At 4 and 7:30 p.m., Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, 800-982-2787, fiaf.org. (Eric Grode)\nThe Essential John Ford  (Through Aug. 2) Even this 20-film retrospective is just a drop in the bucket for Ford, who directed 15 films in 1919 alone. But it\u2019s a wide enough representation to include such legendary Westerns as \u201cMy Darling Clementine,\u201d \u201cThe Searchers,\u201d \u201cThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\u201d and \u201cStagecoach\u201d \u2014 all from a man who was born and raised in Maine. Ford\u2019s World War II drama \u201cThey Were Expendable\u201d didn\u2019t make the cut, but \u201cThe Wings of Eagles,\u201d his biopic of the Navy commander who wrote the screenplay to that film, will be shown on July 25. Perhaps the rarest offering, a 1927 backstage comedy called \u201cUpstream,\u201d was considered lost until the New Zealand Film Archive unearthed a print in 2009; it will screen on July 26 with live piano accompaniment and vocals. Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 37th Street, Astoria, Queens, 718-784-0077, movingimage.us. (Grode)\nGlorious Technicolor: From George Eastman House and Beyond  (through Aug. 5) Technicolor really hit its stride in the 1930s, when its sinfully lush hues made it Hollywood\u2019s go-to color process. Although the company itself didn\u2019t turn out a film (the lost romance \u201cThe Gulf Between\u201d) until 1917, it was founded two years earlier, which has prompted this centennial tribute. This week\u2019s offerings include \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d with Judy Garland and James Mason (Friday at 1:15 p.m. and Thursday at 7 p.m.). Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 11 West 53rd Street, 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Grode)\nIndie 80s (Friday through Aug. 27) At BAM Rose Cinemas. See photo highlight. The 1970s and 1990s have established reputations as incubators for indie filmmakers, but this BAMcin\u00e9matek retrospective makes a strong case for the decade in the middle. Among the nearly 70 films are headline makers (\u201cBlue Velvet,\u201d \u201cRoger & Me,\u201d \u201cSex, Lies and Videotape\u201d), unsung efforts by the likes of Jon Jost (\u201cBell Diamond\u201d) and Rob Nilsson (who will do a Q. and A. after his unsparing, obsessive \u201cHeat and Sunlight\u201d on Monday), and everything in between. African-American talent also receives some serious attention, from genre-tweaking laughs (\u201cHollywood Shuffle,\u201d with four showings on Friday) to groundbreaking interiority (the recently rediscovered \u201cLosing Ground\u201d). Of particular note is a director\u2019s cut of Charles Burnett\u2019s \u201cMy Brother\u2019s Wedding,\u201d which was originally released, in a grand total of one theater, before he had finished editing it. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, 718-636-4100, bam.org. (Grode)\nLet Us Now Praise Famous Men: The Films of Pedro Costa (Friday through July 30) \u201cThe neighborhood refused this kind of cinema, it didn\u2019t want it.\u201d This is the Portuguese director Pedro Costa describing Fontainhas, the Lisbon slum (now demolished) where he filmed the drama \u201cOssos\u201d in 1997. Effective and hypnotic as that film is, it marked the end of one style of filmmaking and the beginning of a new, relentlessly Spartan style. Mr. Costa would spend six months in Fontainhas filming his next feature, \u201cIn Vanda\u2019s Room,\u201d all but single-handedly, and came back for the aptly titled \u201cColossal Youth.\u201d His fourth Fontainhas film, \u201cHorse Money,\u201d will be released July 24, and so Film Society of Lincoln Center is showing the first three along with other titles, including a sidebar of films selected by Mr. Costa himself. Walter Reade Theater , Lincoln Center, 165 West 65th Street, 212-875-5601, filmlinc.com. (Eric Grode)\nMexico at Midnight  (Thursday through July 29) Even the most jaded film-noir buff should find plenty to delight and surprise in this eye-opening series dedicated to Mexico\u2019s robust noir industry in the 1940s and 1950s. The genre\u2019s shadowy tropes may not come as much of a shock, and some of the faces may be familiar, notably Dolores Del Rio, who returned to Mexico after being called box-office poison in Hollywood. But the Hays Code, which bedeviled filmmakers in the States, was nowhere to be found south of the border, and titles like \u201cNight Falls\u201d (July 24 and 26), which adds delightfully earthy insult to injury in its finale, demonstrate just how much Hollywood couldn\u2019t show at the time. Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 11 West 53rd Street, 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Grode)\nMovie Masks: The Roles of Masks in Cinema  (through Aug. 28) Leatherface, Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers, the revolving door of \u201cScream\u201d killers: Modern-day horror film murderers sure like to do their slaughtering incognito. Part of the Cabaret Cinema program, this weekly film series at the Rubin Museum of Art, which runs in conjunction with its \u201cBecoming Another: The Power of Masks\u201d exhibition, mostly steers clear of that genre. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, 212-620-5000, rubinmuseum.org. (Grode)\nOne-Film Wonders  (Friday through Sept. 3) Anthology Film Archives is managing to fit 17 complete career retrospectives into just 18 days. How? By programming the complete oeuvres of one-and-done directors who never got a second shot. Some of these films, most notably Charles Laughton\u2019s gorgeous and deeply disturbing \u201cThe Night of the Hunter\u201d (Aug. 13, 16 and 18), will make you wonder why on earth these men and women never got behind a camera again; others might make you wonder how they ever got there in the first place. And several are somewhere in the middle, like the revisionist sequel \u201cReturn to Oz\u201d (Saturday, Monday and Wednesday) by the revered editor Walter Murch, and Kenneth Macpherson\u2019s 1930 silent film \u201cBorderline\u201d (Saturday and Monday), which starred Paul Robeson and managed to be both behind and ahead of its time. (Screenings continue Aug. 13 through 19 and Sept. 1 through 3.) 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, 212-505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org. (Grode) \nOutdoor Cinema  (Wednesday) It\u2019s fitting that Queens, which has been called the world\u2019s most ethnically diverse place, should play host to the city\u2019s most international outdoor movie series, through Aug. 19. This week features a documentary about ship-breaking (\u201cIron Crows\u201d from Bangladesh), while coming dates include films from Saudi Arabia (\u201cWadjda\u201d) and the Czech Republic (\u201cAlice,\u201d Jan Svankmajer\u2019s decidedly family-unfriendly riff on Lewis Carroll). Each week begins at 7 p.m. with a pre-screening performance. 32-01 Vernon Boulevard, at Broadway, Long Island City, 718-956-1819, socratessculpturepark.org. (Grode)\nAndrei Tarkovsky, Sculpting in Time (Fridays through Aug. 28) What would Andrei Tarkovsky have thought about \u201cTerminator Genisys\u201d? The question isn\u2019t quite as ludicrous as it sounds: Tarkovsky, whose lapidary, visually sumptuous style earned raves from the likes of Ingmar Bergman, was a fan of the original \u201cTerminator\u201d despite what he called its \u201clow acting skills.\u201d The subtitle of this essential series at the Museum of Arts and Design refers to both Tarkovsky\u2019s 1986 book on film theory, which was published just before his death, and his often-expressed desire to warp the passage of time through his films. All seven of his full-length works \u2014 and \u201cfull length\u201d is a good way to describe his 205-minute masterpiece \u201cAndrei Rublev,\u201d which had been chopped up for years \u2014 will be screened, along with the recent documentary \u201cDirected by Andrei Tarkovsky.\u201d 2 Columbus Circle, Manhattan, 212-299-7777, madmuseum.org.\nTrue Crime  (through Aug. 5) The 50 stories you are about to see are true \u2014 more or less. This week\u2019s offerings include \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d and \u201cHeavenly Creatures,\u201d and from South Korea, \u201cMemories of Murder.\u201d Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, 212-727-8110, filmforum.org.

    "text": "Movie Listings for July 3-9\n2015-07-02T22:57:55.000Z\nRatings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.\n\u2018ABCD 2\u2019 (No rating, 2:27, in Hindi) This Bollywood sequel about a dance troupe (the title comes from \u201cAny Body Can Dance\u201d) heading to an international hip-hop competition in Las Vegas is a contrived affair with limp drama and a pummelingly loud soundtrack. It will leave you exhausted, and not in a good way. Where is Shah Rukh Khan when you need him? (Andy Webster)\n\u2018Avengers: Age of Ultron\u2019 (PG-13, 2:21) For Marvel agnostics, the single most interesting thing about this sequel is that you can sense that the director, Joss Whedon, having helped build a universal earnings machine with the first \u201cAvengers,\u201d has struggled mightily to invest this one with some life. He has and he hasn\u2019t. (Manohla Dargis)\n\u2018Batkid Begins\u2019 (PG, 1:29) Whipping up a heady brew of sickness, sentiment and superhero adulation, Dana Nachman\u2019s awe-struck documentary about the exaggerated response to a child\u2019s simple wish makes you wonder just who, exactly, is benefiting from the palaver. (Jeannette Catsoulis)\n\u2605 \u2018A Borrowed Identity\u2019 (No rating, 1:44, in Hebrew and Arabic) There is sublime literary pacing in Eran Riklis\u2019s well-observed adaptation of autobiographical novels by the author and journalist Sayed Kashua (who wrote the script). When a gifted Arab-Israeli tries to assimilate into a Jerusalem boarding school, he finds resentment and frustration at every turn. His ultimate solution to his troubles is seemingly unlikely and yet somehow inevitable. (Webster)\n\u2018Dope\u2019 (R, 1:45) A caper movie and a coming-of-age story, Rick Famuyiwa\u2019s exuberant, messy feature pays playful, critical tribute to the ghetto melodramas of the 1990s. Its hero, Malcolm (Shameik Moore) is a nerd navigating a world of drug dealers and racial stereotypes, which the movie both mocks and perpetuates. (A. O. Scott)\n\u2605 \u2018Eden\u2019 (R, 2:11, in French) Spanning two decades and many terrific tunes, Mia Hansen-Love\u2019s perceptive and compassionate tale of a driven D.J. (F\u00e9lix de Givry) during the rise of French garage music in the 1990s rides its techno-sonic wave with a restless intelligence. (Catsoulis)\n\u2018Entourage\u2019 (R, 1:44) Naw, bro. (Scott)\n\u2018Escobar: Paradise Lost\u2019 (R, 2:00) A wily conspiracy of hooded eyes, crooning voice and thrusting gut, Benicio Del Toro\u2019s drug kingpin Pablo Escobar is elbowed aside by this fact-studded fiction\u2019s near-ruinous focus on a gormless surfer played by the chronically inexpressive Josh Hutcherson. (Catsoulis)\n\u2605 \u2018Ex Machina\u2019 (R, 1:50) Alex Garland\u2019s slyly spooky futuristic shocker about old and new desires turns on the relationships that bind together a robot called Ava (a terrific Alicia Vikander); the software zillionaire who created her (Oscar Isaac, wonderful); and a visitor (Domhnall Gleeson) who\u2019s seriously out of his depth. (Dargis)\n\u2018Far From the Madding Crowd\u2019 (PG-13, 2:00) In this brisk adaptation of Thomas Hardy\u2019s novel, Carey Mulligan plays Bathsheba Everdene, whose efforts to manage the farm she has inherited are interrupted by the attention of three very different suitors: her stodgy neighbor (Michael Sheen), a dissolute soldier (Tom Sturridge) and a salt-of-the-earth shepherd (Matthias Schoenaerts). (Scott)\n\u2018Infinitely Polar Bear\u2019 (R, 1:30) In her sweet, somewhat nutty feature debut, the writer-director Maya Forbes looks back on her 1970s childhood and her father (played by the infinitely warm Mark Ruffalo), a down-and-out charmer with manic depression. Zoe Saldana co-stars as the infinitely patient wife and mom. (Dargis)\n\u2605 \u2018Inside Out\u2019 (PG, 1:42) Voiced by a cast of blue-chip comic performers (principally Amy Poehler, Bill Hader, Phyllis Smith, Lewis Black and Mindy Kaling), this Pixar gem works on one level as a workplace sitcom set in the mind of an 11-year-old girl. It\u2019s funny and visually inventive. But it also has a profound and powerful emotional resonance, as Pete Docter, the writer and director, conducts a tour of the mental life of a child on the verge of momentous changes. (Scott)\n\u2018Insidious: Chapter 3\u2019 (PG-13, 1:37) This highly profitable horror franchise \u2014 virtually devoid of gore, nudity and cursing \u2014 rolls on with this installment, which, like its antecedents, offers simple, cohesive plotting; tidy production values; effective \u201cBoo!\u201d moments; a sense of humor; and most important, the winning actress Lin Shaye as a ghost wrangler. (Webster)\n\u2605 \u2018Iris\u2019 (PG-13, 1:20) There are few better ways right now to spend your movie minutes than this delightful eye-opener about life, love, statement eyeglasses, bracelets the size of tricycle tires and the art of making the grandest of entrances. The movie was directed by Albert Maysles, one-half of the team behind \u201cGrey Gardens.\u201d (Dargis)\n\u2018I\u2019ll See You In My Dreams\u2019 (PG-13, 1:35) To the lengthening list of well-mannered films aimed at moviegoers who have reached an age when, to quote Shakespeare, \u201cthe heyday in the blood is tame,\u201d add \u201cI\u2019ll See You In My Dreams,\u201d a modest, quietly touching portrait of an older woman radiantly embodied by Blythe Danner. (Stephen Holden)\n\u2018Jurassic World\u2019 (PG-13, 2:04) There\u2019s more flab than muscle packed on this galumphing franchise reboot, which, as it lumbers from scene to scene, reminds you of what a great action god Steven Spielberg is. Too bad he didn\u2019t take the reins on this, which features Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard and digital dinos. (Dargis)\n\u2605 \u2018A Little Chaos\u2019 (R, 1:52) In the handsomely mounted period drama directed by Alan Rickman, Mr. Rickman stars as the wily French \u201cSun King\u201d Louis XIV who has just moved his court to Versailles. Here, his chief landscape architect (Matthias Schoenaerts) hires Sabine De Barra (Kate Winslet), a sturdy, guileless everyday woman, to design the Rockwork Grove, an outdoor arena-like ballroom whose completion is imperiled by court intrigue. (Holden)\n\u2605 \u2018Love & Mercy\u2019 (PG-13, 2:00) The life and music of Brian Wilson, the sonically gifted, emotionally troubled genius of the Beach Boys, is the subject of this unusually sensitive and astute biopic, directed by Bill Pohlad. Paul Dano and John Cusack give a remarkable composite performance as Wilson at two pivotal moments: in the mid-1960s, when he recorded \u201cPet Sounds,\u201d one of the great pop albums of the era; and 20 years later, when Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks), who would become his second wife, helped free him from the influence of his psychologist, Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti). (Scott)\n\u2605 \u2018Mad Max: Fury Road\u2019 (R, 2:00) George Miller, the Australian action maestro who directed the three earlier \u201cMad Max\u201d movies before moving on to the \u201cHappy Feet\u201d franchise, returns to roaring, squalling, high-octane form in this episode, which is both a relentless car-chase movie and a stirring feminist fable. Tom Hardy is excellent as the road-weary, haunted Max, but the movie belongs to Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa, a one-armed truck-driver turned liberator and avenger of oppressed women. (Scott)\n\u2605 \u2018Magic Mike XXL\u2019 (R, 1:55) Channing Tatum returns as Mike Lane, who temporarily steps away from his fledgling furniture business to join his stripper \u2014 sorry, \u201cmale entertainer\u201d \u2014 buddies on a mostly shirtless road trip from Tampa to Myrtle Beach. This sequel has less plot than the first \u201cMagic Mike,\u201d and a lot more skin, sex and movement. It advances a sophisticated theory of pleasure, and it\u2019s also a blast. (Scott)\n\u2018Mala Mala\u2019 (No rating, 1:29, in Spanish) This sensitive and thoughtful documentary, which interviews transgender prostitutes, drag queens, small-business owners and activists in Puerto Rico about their transitions and relationships, affirms the dignity of its subjects. But it also shows how hard those personal journeys are, and how little glamour attaches to the pursuit of selfhood. (Daniel M. Gold)\n\u2018Manglehorn\u2019 (PG-13, 1:37) Al Pacino brings his brand of soulful jive to the lonely Texas locksmith of the title, playing a courtly curmudgeon who\u2019s interested in a bank teller (Holly Hunter) but hooked on a long-lost lover. The director David Gordon Green tells a familiar story of self-realization that gets a bit more groove in its step thanks to Mr. Pacino. (Nicolas Rapold)\n\u2018Max\u2019 (PG, 1:50) The story of a military dog helping a boy get the better of some small-town Texas bad guys. Hokey and sometimes jarringly violent, but hard to resist. (Scott)\n\u2018Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\u2019 (PG-13, 1:45) This story of two movie-mad Pittsburgh teenage boys who befriend a classmate with cancer could have been an earnest wallow in maudlin self-pity, and it almost is that. But the director, Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, and the screenwriter, Jesse Andrews (adapting his own young-adult novel), keep the movie loose and humorous, and the three main actors (Thomas Mann, RJ Cyler and Olivia Cooke) are pleasant, sympathetic company. (Scott)\n\u2018The Overnight\u2019 (R, 1:20) Bland meets bold in Patrick Brice\u2019s comedy, which dips its toe in the new sexual revolution and comes across as a skittish redo of Paul Mazursky\u2019s 1969 sex comedy, \u201cBob & Carol & Ted & Alice.\u201d Adam Scott & Taylor Schilling & Jason Schwartzman & Judith Godr\u00e8che star. (Dargis)\n\u2605 \u2018A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence\u2019 (PG-13, 1:43) Sketch tragedy? Fatalistic slapstick? Self-hating humanism? Whatever you call it, Roy Andersson\u2019s latest assemblage of dark, impeccably framed vignettes reflects on the awful, funny condition of our species, and a few others as well. (Scott)\n\u2018Pitch Perfect 2\u2019 (PG-13, 1:50) Not perfect, but good fun all the same. The Barden Bellas return for more a cappella high jinks. Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) is in fine form, Beca (Anna Kendrick) is in good voice and there are a few new additions, notably Hailee Steinfeld. The too-busy plot is kind of beside the point, and not all of the jokes work, but it\u2019s almost impossible to see this movie without being at least a little bit tickled and uplifted. (Scott)\n\u2018A Poem Is A Naked Person\u2019 (No rating, 1:30) Les Blank\u2019s ruminative 1974 documentary about the American roots musician Leon Russell is a mellow, observant collaboration between two restless and eccentric artists \u2014 the filmmaker and his subject. (Scott)\n\u2018Runoff\u2019 (R, 1:30) Kimberly Levin\u2019s promising debut film is almost a horror movie with a social conscience about a rural farming family pressured by a heartless Monsanto-like corporation to sell their property. (Holden)\n\u2018The Salt of the Earth\u2019 (No rating, 1:50) Wim Wenders\u2019s documentary portrait of the photographer Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado is an admiring, generous introduction to a body of work that combines moral witness with visual beauty. (Scott)\n\u2018San Andreas\u2019 (PG-13, 1:54) California tumbles into the sea. Dwayne Johnson saves his family. (Scott)\n\u2018Spy\u2019 (R, 1:59) Melissa McCarthy plays Susan Cooper, a C.I.A. desk-jockey turned international super-espionage dynamo in this loose, buoyant, profane comedy, written and directed by Paul Feig. The supporting players include Jason Statham, Jude Law, Rose Byrne and Miranda Hart. They are all very funny, but Ms. McCarthy is her own best sidekick. She\u2019s a one-woman improv troupe. (Scott)\n\u2018Ted 2\u2019 (R, 1:59) In this comedy dead zone, the director Seth MacFarlane again gives voice to the title character, a foul-mouthed stuffed toy bear, while Mark Wahlberg plays the bear\u2019s dimwitted second banana. Seriously, you can do better. (Dargis)\n\u2018Terminator Genisys\u2019 (PG-13, 2:05) Yes, he is back, because while the series thrill is lamentably long gone, franchises now apparently last forever. Arnold Schwarzenegger stars alongside Emilia Clarke and Jason Clarke. (Dargis)\n\u2605 \u2018Testament of Youth\u2019 (PG-13, 2:09) James Kent\u2019s stately screen adaptation of the British author Vera Brittain\u2019s 1933 World War I memoir evokes the march of history with a balance and restraint exhibited by few movies with such grand ambitions. Alicia Vikander, who plays Brittain, gives her character a bracing edge of intelligence and a proto-feminist attitude. (Holden)\n\u2018Tomorrowland\u2019 (PG, 2:10) Brad Bird\u2019s live-action science-fiction adventure, starring George Clooney and Britt Robertson, is a sincere lecture on the importance of optimism and the perils of cynicism. Or at least it wants to be, but the futuristic idealism feels more like corporate propaganda. (Scott)\n\u2018The Tribe\u2019 (No rating, 2:12) Set in a Ukrainian boarding school for the deaf, Myroslav Slaboshpytskiy\u2019s film \u2014 in sign language, without subtitles \u2014 is a formal tour de force. It\u2019s also, less impressively, a punishing allegory of human awfulness. (Scott)\n\u2605 \u2018What Happened, Miss Simone?\u2019 (No rating, 1:41) Liz Garbus directed this electric, bracingly urgent documentary portrait, which traces the singer Nina Simone\u2019s life from her early childhood as a piano prodigy named Eunice Waymon to her troubled years \u2014 mentally, physically, spiritually \u2014 and finally her later return to glory. (Dargis)\n\u2018Wild Tales\u2019 (R, 1:54, in Spanish) As high-spirited as its title suggests, this anthology from the Argentine writer-director Dami\u00e1n Szifron offers up a scabrous, often unsettlingly funny look at human behavior in extremis. The best stories are as narratively stripped down as a Road Runner cartoon; they make worrying over ethics seem somehow self-indulgent. (Dargis)\n\u2605 \u2018The Wolfpack\u2019 (R, 1:24) A New York story beautifully told, Crystal Moselle\u2019s astonishing documentary tells the tale of the six Angulo brothers, who metaphorically escaped from their Lower East Side apartment through their fervent love for movies. It\u2019s an unfamiliar tale, one partly distinguished by its persuasive intimacy. (Dargis)\n\u2018Woman in Gold\u2019 (PG-13, 1:47) The movie rests heavily on the squared shoulders of Helen Mirren whose real-life character, Maria Altmann, is a proud, elderly Austrian Jewish woman struggling for the possession of a priceless Gustav Klimt painting stolen by the Nazis. Her performance salvages a film that without her, would be a laborious slog down a well-trodden path. (Holden)\n\u2605 \u2018The Yes Men are Revolting\u2019 (R, 1:32) The third and best movie about the mischievous media satirists who stage hoaxes that embarrass corporations opposed to global warming is very funny but a little wistful, because these cheeky activists aren\u2019t getting any younger, and the rewards are meager. (Holden)\nFilm Series\n3-D Summer  (throughSaturday) Three-dimensional films are typically associated with the 1950s, when some 50 different titles ran the gamut from unapologetically lowbrow (\u201cRobot Monster\u201d) to classy, except for the handful of comin\u2019-at-ya! gimmicks (\u201cDial M for Murder\u201d). But 3-D actually made its debut on June 10, 1915, making this a centennial tribute. The earliest existing example, a 1922 demonstration film called \u201cThru the Trees: Washington, D.C.,\u201d will be part of an evening of 3-D rarities (Saturday). The other two screenings are far more established titles with some seriously underutilized supporting talent: the 1953 John Wayne western \u201cHondo\u201d (Saturday), for which John Ford served as an uncredited second unit director, and the film version of \u201cKiss Me Kate\u201d (starting June 28), including the first filmed \u2014 and tiny \u2014 glimpse of Bob Fosse\u2019s choreography. At various times, Museum of Modern Art, Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Eric Grode)\nSean Baker x 3 (Thursday) Given the rhapsodic attention at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival paid to Mr. Baker\u2019s new film, \u201cTangerine\u201d (and not just because of its microbudget, having been shot entirely on three iPhones), it would be easy to assume that this writer-director was the hottest new name fresh out of film school. In fact, Mr. Baker has released three other hypernaturalistic films over the last decade. Film Society of Lincoln Center is showing two of them \u2014 the New York City immigration drama \u201cPrince of Broadway\u201d (2008), and \u201cStarlet\u201d (2012), about an unlikely friendship between an elderly widow and a porn star \u2014 along with \u201cTangerine,\u201d which officially opens next Friday. Mr. Baker will participate in a Q. and A. following \u201cTangerine\u201d and then introduce \u201cStarlet.\u201d At 5, 7 and 9:20 p.m., Walter Reade Theater, Lincoln Center, 165 West 65th Street, 212-875-5601, filmlinc.com. (Grode)\nJean-Claude Carri\u00e8re: Writing the Impossible  (Tuesdays) Any career that involves writing for Jacques Tati, Nicole Kidman and the romantic pairing of Charlotte Rampling and a chimpanzee would benefit from a taste for the surreal. Luckily, Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re has a gourmand\u2019s appetite for the odd, and with more than 50 years\u2019 worth of credits, there\u2019s plenty for the French Institute Alliance Fran\u00e7aise to choose from. (If only there were room for the five-hour adaptation of \u201cThe Mahabharata\u201d he did with Peter Brook.) This nine-week series continues this week with \u201cMax mon Amour\u201d (1986), starring Charlotte Rampling. (Through July 28.) At 4 and 7:30 p.m., Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, 800-982-2787, fiaf.org. (Grode)\nThe Essential John Ford  (Friday through Sunday) Even this 20-film retrospective is just a drop in the bucket for Ford, who directed 15 films in 1919 alone. But it\u2019s a wide enough representation to include such legendary Westerns as \u201cMy Darling Clementine,\u201d \u201cThe Searchers,\u201d \u201cThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\u201d and \u201cStagecoach\u201d \u2014 all from a man who was born and raised in Maine. Ford\u2019s World War II drama \u201cThey Were Expendable\u201d didn\u2019t make the cut, but \u201cThe Wings of Eagles,\u201d his biopic of the Navy commander who wrote the screenplay to that film, will air July 25. Perhaps the rarest offering, a 1927 backstage comedy called \u201cUpstream,\u201d was considered lost until the New Zealand Film Archive unearthed a print in 2009; it will screen July 26 with live piano accompaniment and vocals. All this, as well as Henry Fonda in \u201cThe Grapes of Wrath\u201d and, kicking things off on Friday at 7 p.m., \u201cYoung Mr. Lincoln.\u201d (Through Aug. 2.) Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 37th Street, Astoria, Queens, 718-784-0077, movingimage.us. (Grode)\nGlorious Technicolor: From George Eastman House and Beyond  (Friday through August 5) Technicolor really hit its stride in the 1930s, when its sinfully lush hues made it Hollywood\u2019s go-to color process. Although the company itself didn\u2019t turn out a film (the lost romance \u201cThe Gulf Between\u201d) until 1917, it was founded two years earlier, which has prompted this centennial tribute. This week\u2019s offerings include \u201cMogambo,\u201d with Clark Gable and Grace Kelly, directed by John Ford. (Saturday at 3:45 p.m.) Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Grode)\n\u2018Live-In Maid\u2019  (Wednesday) It\u2019s fitting that Queens, which has been called the world\u2019s most ethnically diverse place, should play host to the city\u2019s most international outdoor movie series. While Bryant Park screens \u201cThe Poseidon Adventure\u201d and Nitehawk Cinema presents \u201cBilly Madison\u201d this week, Film Forum and Rooftop Cinema team up to show this warmhearted 2005 Argentine comedy in Socrates Sculpture Park. Subsequent weeks will feature works from Bangladesh (\u201cIron Crows\u201d), Saudi Arabia (\u201cWadjda\u201d) and the Czech Republic (\u201cAlice,\u201d Jan Svankmajer\u2019s decidedly family-unfriendly riff on Lewis Carroll). Pre-screening performances begin each week begins at 7 p.m. 32-01 Vernon Boulevard, at Broadway, Long Island City, 718-956-1819, socratessculpturepark.org. (Grode)\nMovie Masks: The Roles of Masks in Cinema  (Friday through Aug. 28) Leatherface, Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers, the revolving door of \u201cScream\u201d killers: Modern-day horror film murderers sure like to do their slaughtering incognito. Part of the Cabaret Cinema program, this weekly film series at the Rubin Museum of Art, which runs in conjunction with its \u201cBecoming Another: The Power of Masks\u201d exhibition, mostly steers clear of that genre, focusing on masks that are rakish (\u201cThe Princess Bride,\u201d July 10) or sneaky (\u201cTo Catch a Thief,\u201d Aug. 28). 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, 212-620-5000, rubinmuseum.org. (Grode)\nNew York Asian Film Festival  (Friday through July 11) The endorsements from Jackie Chan and Fangoria magazine should signal that this festival, now in its 14th year, isn\u2019t likely to yield the next Ozu or Mizoguchi. To be fair, with more than 50 titles offered, audiences can find such contemplative fare as the unsentimental Chinese drama \u201cRiver Road.\u201d But genre tends to hold sway here, with mindblowers like the hip-hop action musical \u201cTokyo Tribe\u201d and the scandalous 2005 Korean comedy \u201cThe President\u2019s Last Bang.\u201d Special series within the festival pay tribute to the Korean company Myung Films, the Japanese director Daihachi Yoshida and \u201cThe Last Men in Japanese Film,\u201d a series honoring the legendary actors Ken Takakura and Bunta Sugawara. At various times; Walter Reade Theater, Lincoln Center, 165 West 65th Street, 212-875-5601; and SVA Theater, 333 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, 212-592-2980; subwaycinema.com/nyaff15. (Grode)\n\u2018The Third Man\u2019  (through Thursday) Most people cannot improve upon Graham Greene, but Orson Welles was not most people. His \u201ccuckoo clock\u201d speech, added by Welles on the set and delivered to a horrified Joseph Cotten in the Prater amusement park, would be the unquestioned highlight of just about every film ever made \u2014 and it barely cracks the Top 5 in Carol Reed\u2019s 1949 masterpiece, set in the rubble-strewn streets of post-World War II Vienna. This new digital restoration, the film\u2019s first major revamp, promises to make Anton Karas\u2019s (briefly chart-topping) zither score and Robert Krasker\u2019s iconic cinematography sound and look richer and more chilling than ever. At various times, Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, 212-727-8110, filmforum.org. (Grode)",

    "text": "Trudeau\u2019s Canada, Again\n2015-12-08T10:00:24.000Z\nOn Tuesday, Nov. 10, six days after Justin Trudeau, leader of the Liberal Party, was sworn in as prime minister of Canada, I was shown into his office on the third floor of the Parliament building in Ottawa. A dark oak-paneled room, it contained a jumble of outsize furniture chosen by the previous occupant, Stephen Harper, whose Conservative Party was in power for a decade. The office had the air of a recently abandoned bunker \u2014 shelves bare, curtains drawn, personal effects hastily removed. Trudeau\u2019s father, Pierre, occupied the same office for 16 years during the 1960s, \u201970s and \u201980s, and the new prime minister would shortly install his father\u2019s old desk, a symbol of restoration but also an emphatic rejection of his predecessor. The squat, bulldoglike bureau left by the departing prime minister, Trudeau implied, was a reflection of Harper\u2019s autocratic manner.\n\u2018\u2018We\u2019re going to move this place around,\u2019\u2019 Trudeau said. \u2018\u2018This is very much the last guy\u2019s style, not mine. I\u2019ll have a smaller desk in the corner and a bigger couch so we can sit down and actually have discussions. I\u2019ll put a reclining seat over there, for me to read.\u2019\u2019 He smiled as he mentally redecorated the space, the Canadian version of the Oval Office. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a different approach.\u2019\u2019\nThere is virtually no transition period in Canadian politics, and it was clear that the electoral win on Oct. 19 had caught Trudeau, his staff and the country by surprise. During his first days in office, his small, overworked campaign team tried to cope with the unexpected demands of governing. With so many positions to fill, they had issued a call for r\u00e9sum\u00e9s on social media and received 22,000.\nTrudeau, who is 43, was still working on getting his staff to call him \u2018\u2018Prime Minister.\u2019\u2019 For years, he was \u2018\u2018Justin,\u2019\u2019 and staff members often still referred to him that way. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s like your really smart friend suddenly became prime minister,\u2019\u2019 Kate Purchase, his communications director, told me.\n\u2018\u2018People in the street will either call me \u2018Prime Minister\u2019 or \u2018Justin,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Trudeau said. \u2018\u2018We\u2019ll see how that goes. But when I\u2019m working, when I\u2019m with my staff in public, I\u2019m \u2018Prime Minister.\u2019 I say that if we\u2019re drinking beer out of a bottle, and you can see my tattoos, you should be comfortable calling me \u2018Justin.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019\nIn person, Trudeau was as upbeat and friendly \u2014 as nice \u2014 as might be expected of a politician with a campaign mantra of \u2018\u2018Sunny Ways,\u2019\u2019 a reference to the optimistic adage of Wilfrid Laurier, a Liberal prime minister at the turn of the 20th century. Trudeau is 6-foot-2 and has an athletic build, his hair neatly trimmed after years experimenting with a variety of shaggy manes. There was little of the pomp of the powerful \u2014 just an aide named Tommy, who brought him half a tuna sandwich and a cup of chicken-noodle soup for lunch from the cafeteria downstairs. This was the first print interview Trudeau had granted since taking office, and in his presence there was a palpable sense that he was still figuring out exactly how to play this new role \u2014 how to talk, how to gesture, how to adopt the mien of a world leader. Despite his studied manner, he was prone to providing glimpses of his unguarded self.\n\u2018\u2018It\u2019s very, very cool to have the president call up, and I say, \u2018Hello, Mr. President.\u2019 I\u2019ve never met him,\u2019\u2019 Trudeau said. He dropped his voice an octave to imitate President Obama: \u2018\u2018Justin, I like to think of myself as a young politician. The gray hair caught up with me, and it\u2019ll catch up with you. But calling me \u2018Sir\u2019 makes me feel old. Call me \u2018Barack.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019\nTrudeau shook his head, amazed. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s going to take some getting used to.\u2019\u2019\nOne week later, a new geopolitical relationship between America and Canada would begin in a conference room in Manila at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting, when Trudeau and Obama sat down for the first time to talk. In an age of a rising China, Middle Eastern chaos and Russian belligerence, it may sound strange to say, but the United States has no relationship more important than the one with Canada. The country is one of America\u2019s largest trading partners (on par with China), a peaceful neighbor and a crucial ally in global affairs \u2014 when the relationship is functional, as it hasn\u2019t been in recent years. Harper\u2019s hawkish foreign policy put him at odds with Obama on the Iran nuclear treaty, Israeli-Palestinian relations and Syrian refugees. In domestic affairs, Harper was strongly in favor of the Keystone XL pipeline, which Obama resisted; the president killed the project two weeks after the Conservatives lost. The discord may largely have ended with Trudeau\u2019s election, though Canada will be less likely to participate in airstrikes against ISIS in the Middle East.\nThe 45-minute session in Manila was casual and friendly; two of Obama\u2019s campaign aides worked for Trudeau\u2019s campaign, and the president followed the Canadian race and knew of the excitement the victory had generated around the world \u2014 much as his own triumph had in 2008.\nIn a private conversation, the president advised Trudeau to be active early, but also to think about calibrating sky-high expectations with a long-term plan for governance. Obama shared his impressions of various world leaders, suggesting whom to build relationships with \u2014 and whom to steer clear of. Obama issued an invitation to Washington, and later to a state dinner to be held in the new year, the first honoring a Canadian prime minister in 19 years. The president went out of his way to make clear that he looked forward to spending personal time together, with their wives. \u2018\u2018There was an air of mentorship but not in a paternalistic way,\u2019\u2019 Ben Rhodes, Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser, said. \u2018\u2018Trudeau\u2019s going to be on the stage for a long time. He\u2019s got a ton of talent.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018\u2018It was nice to confirm in person how like-minded we are on so many issues,\u2019\u2019 Trudeau told me. \u2018\u2018He said that seeing my family on TV on election night reminded him of his election in 2008 with his family. I\u2019m looking forward to having a beer with him.\u2019\u2019\nThe election this fall was nothing less than an existential struggle over what it means to be Canadian. On one side, there was Harper\u2019s vision of a nation in an age of terror, in a world afire with conflict. On the other was Trudeau\u2019s moderate liberal belief that the world is not riven by an epic clash of civilizations, and that cultural and religious and linguistic differences and openness are Canada\u2019s strength.\nWhat the world knows as a progressive modern Canada was created largely under the rule of the Liberal leader Lester Pearson and then Pierre Trudeau in the \u201960s and \u201970s, when the country began to sever its ties with Britain and assert its own identity. The country created a new flag, replacing the Union Jack with the Maple Leaf, and adopted a national anthem. Quintessential Canadian characteristics \u2014 universal medical care, bilingualism, multiculturalism, a strong voice for peace and development at the United Nations \u2014 were born during that era. The earliest major political initiative of Pierre Trudeau in the late \u201960s was to decriminalize homosexuality. \u2018\u2018The state has no business in the bedrooms of the nation,\u2019\u2019 he said. In rapid succession, Trudeau legalized abortion, funded the arts and promoted a race-blind immigration policy, which over time would transform the great cities of the country into polyglot metropolises.\nDefeating the son of Pierre Trudeau would have been a metaphysical vindication for Harper. For the past decade, Harper did all he could to undo the legacy of the older Trudeau, internationally, domestically and symbolically. In defense of \u2018\u2018old stock\u2019\u2019 white Canada, Harper denigrated the United Nations, made the modest attire of Muslim women a political issue and recast Canada\u2019s role in the world as part of a grand alliance to defend Western civilization. Harper freely admitted to loathing the older Trudeau, despite an adolescent fascination, writing ungraciously after his death in 2000 about meeting him for the first time in the streets of Montreal. \u2018\u2018There I came face to face with a living legend, someone who had provoked both the loves and hatreds of my political passion, all in the form of a tired-out, little old man.\u2019\u2019 Harper\u2019s greatest ambition was to destroy Trudeau\u2019s vision of the country: \u2018\u2018He continues to define the myths that guide the Canadian psyche, but myths they are.\u2019\u2019\nPierre Trudeau at a party in Hull, Quebec, in 1968, the year he was first elected the leader of the Liberal Party.\nPierre Trudeau at a party in Hull, Quebec, in 1968, the year he was first elected the leader of the Liberal Party.\nPierre Trudeau in his office, February 1973.\nJustin Trudeau with his parents on the steps of Parliament in May 1974.\nJustin Trudeau (red trunks) versus the Conservative senator Patrick Brazeau in a charity\u00a0boxing match in 2012. Trudeau won by TKO.\nJustin Trudeau in a meeting with ministers and officials at his office in November.\nAs a Canadian expat living in America, I became acutely aware of the election\u2019s symbolic importance in September, when the body of a little Syrian refugee boy washed up on the shores of Turkey. The child had relations in Canada who tried to help the family immigrate, but Harper had maintained a hard line on Syrian refugees, claiming national secur\u00adity was more important than the humanitarian crisis, and the family was forced to try to escape the war by sea. After the boy\u2019s death, Harper\u2019s government continued to inveigh against Muslim \u2018\u2018jihadi\u2019\u2019 immigration in a way that struck me and many others as astoundingly un-Canadian, at least in a historical sense. But the nation\u2019s self-image was precisely what the Conservatives were determined to remake.\nFor a decade, Harper remained in office through a mix of artful politics, successful economic management and falling crime rates \u2014 as well as inept opposition. During that era\u2019s elections, the more progressive vote split between the Liberals and the New Democrats, a party to the left of the Liberals, allowing Harper to retain the prime ministry. During most of the recent campaign, Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party was running third behind the Conservative Party and the New Democratic Party. But after the death of the Syrian boy and Trudeau\u2019s strong performance in five contentious debates, voters began to abandon the New Democrats, coalescing around Trudeau in the hope of defeating the prime minister.\n\u2018\u2018People decided to line up behind whoever was going to beat Stephen Harper,\u2019\u2019 Trudeau told me. \u2018\u2018I was of the mind that even if there was uncertainty about my own personal ability to run the economy, there was the feeling that the party had a team and history that meant we\u2019d get the compromises and balances you have to make. So I could take much bigger risks to challenge the orthodoxy.\u2019\u2019\nWhile campaigning, Harper portrayed Trudeau as the feckless, high-taxing son of the former prime minister, a novice whose surname was his sole qualification for high office. One of many areas of confrontation during televised debates was a law Harper proposed that would have allowed the government to revoke citizenship for Canadians with dual nationality if they were found guilty of terrorism \u2014 in effect making Canadians born in another country a separate class of citizen.\n\u2018\u2018Why would we not revoke the citizenship of people convicted of terrorist offenses against this country?\u2019\u2019 Harper asked Trudeau incredulously.\n\u2018\u2018A Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian,\u2019\u2019 Trudeau replied defiantly. \u2018\u2018And you devalue the citizenship of every Canadian in this place and in this country when you break down and make it conditional for anyone.\u2019\u2019\nConservatives countered that Trudeau was na\u00efve, rejecting Canada\u2019s role in the war on terror and instead emphasizing soft-minded issues like global warming. \u2018\u2018The focus on climate change as the \u2018top threat,\u2019 while important, is also code for isolationism and an unwillingness to deal with the Islamic State and terrorism in general,\u2019\u2019 said Christopher Alexander, former minister for citizenship and immigration in the Harper government. Alexander remains convinced the country has made a large, potentially tragic mistake in electing Trudeau. \u2018\u2018There was a strong thread of nostalgia in the Liberal campaign for a simpler time, for a more peaceful world and the nostrums of Trudeau\u2019s father when Canada didn\u2019t have to deal with global terror threats,\u2019\u2019 he said.\nHarper\u2019s defeat at the hands of Pierre Trudeau\u2019s son had obvious dramatic dimensions of the classical Greek variety, redeeming not just the family name but also Pierre\u2019s view of the nation. The younger Trudeau has appointed a cabinet from a wide sweep of ethnic groups and made a point of choosing equal numbers of men and women. Virtually every Trudeau initiative, from tax policy to an embrace of the L.G.B.T.Q. community to relations with China, seemed a rebuke to the previous administration. Government scientists, who had been effectively prevented from talking to the press lest they contradict Harper\u2019s skeptical view of climate change, now shared their research with reporters in tones of relieved amazement. Even Trudeau\u2019s simple act of answering questions from journalists in Parliament\u2019s press theater \u2014 a space like the White House\u2019s briefing room \u2014 took on myriad meanings. Harper hadn\u2019t held such a news conference in six years.\n\u2018\u2018It\u2019s a whole new world,\u2019\u2019 a reporter muttered as Trudeau approached the lectern. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know what to do with myself.\u2019\u2019\nNo political figure provokes stronger feelings in Canada than Pierre Trudeau. Depending on whom you ask, he was either the personification of a sophisticated and ambitious Canada or a socialist wastrel libertine. Pierre\u2019s father made a fortune in gas stations, netting $1.2 million in 1932, which freed his son from the need to work \u2014 just as Justin never had to make a living. As a young man, Pierre traveled to Africa and Asia, studied at Harvard and the London School of Economics and socialized with Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir in Paris.\nDuring his time as prime minister from 1968 to 1979 and again from 1980 to 1984, the Montreal-born boulevardier was despised in western Canada for an energy policy that enriched the eastern provinces. He was also hated by separatists in Quebec, who saw him as a quisling for Anglo elitists. Yet in many ways he was a visionary. At the time, Canada\u2019s Constitution could be changed only with the approval of Britain\u2019s Parliament, a colonial vestige. In 1982, this provision was done away with, and Trudeau in effect became a Canadian founding father. An intellectual who approached issues with an analytical and a creative mind, he fashioned a constitutional legal landscape midway between America\u2019s rights-based rules and the unwritten and informal British approach.\nTrudeau gave his son a front seat to history. When he was a boy, Justin met Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan (who recited verses from the poem \u2018\u2018The Shooting of Dan McGrew\u2019\u2019); Richard Nixon toasted the toddler in Ottawa, predicting he would become prime minister someday. But the younger Trudeau told me he never discussed the subject with his father until the last year of his life. \u2018\u2018He was much more focused on having substantive conversations,\u2019\u2019 Trudeau said. \u2018\u2018Politics didn\u2019t fit into that for him.\u2019\u2019\nThe younger Trudeau has a bachelor\u2019s degree from McGill University and a teaching degree from the University of British Columbia, but despite his pedigree and inherited wealth, when he reached adulthood his life was remarkably unremarkable. He traveled the world and smoked marijuana and snowboarded and worked as a bouncer at bars, eventually ending up teaching high school in Vancouver.\nJustin Trudeau\u2019s lack of qualifications to be prime minister were obvious, as was his lack of his father\u2019s erudition \u2014 but he considers himself to have undergone his own peculiar kind of schooling. Trudeau points out that he has visited nearly 100 countries, many of them for international summit meetings with his father, which provided an intimate understanding of statecraft. Travel has also given him compassion for the less fortunate around the globe. In his memoir, \u2018\u2018Common Ground,\u2019\u2019 Trudeau described a moment from a boyhood trip to Bangladesh, recollecting it in the kind of mawkish language his opponents ridicule but that is plainly heartfelt. On state business with his father in Dhaka, the younger Trudeau saw a poor old man with a bicycle wait patiently while their motorcade swept by. He was suddenly seized with empathy for the man, realizing that there were billions of people on earth, each a unique individual, each with a story. \u2018\u2018I have never looked at my life and my circumstances in quite the same way since,\u2019\u2019 he wrote.\nThe drama of the Trudeau family has long played out in the Canadian imagination, much like that of the Kennedys in America. Justin Trudeau\u2019s mother, Margaret, was 22 in 1971 when she married Pierre, then 51. He was the prime minister and a famous eligible bachelor; he was also a workaholic and a notorious skinflint. After giving birth to three boys in quick succession, the beauty dubbed \u2018\u2018Maggie T.\u2019\u2019 by the press smoked marijuana while under the watch of Mounties, ate peyote before giving a speech in Venezuela and left her husband to party at Studio 54 in New York. The Trudeaus eventually divorced. According to Margaret\u2019s own account, she had affairs with Teddy Kennedy, Ryan O\u2019Neal and at least one Rolling Stone.\nDespite the glamorous trappings, a central part of the Trudeau family story is rooted in tragedy, in the death of Justin\u2019s younger brother Michel at the age of 23, in an avalanche on a backcountry ski trip in British Columbia in 1998. His death seemed to touch off a downward spiral in Pierre. A deeply religious man with a Jesuitical cast of mind, he began to doubt his faith. Michel\u2019s death was also devastating for Margaret, and Justin tended to her. It was only later, after Margaret was committed to a mental institution, that she learned she had an undiagnosed case of bipolar disorder; she has turned the cause of mental health into her life\u2019s work.\nThe death of Pierre Trudeau in 2000 marked the beginning of Justin Trudeau\u2019s public life. As the eldest son, then 29, he was asked to give the final eulogy for one of the towering figures in Canada\u2019s history. The state funeral in Montreal for the older Trudeau remains one of the most significant events in Canadian television history, and Justin was the unquestioned star, delivering an emotional remembrance with the touch of a natural orator. \u2018\u2018Je t\u2019aime, Papa,\u2019\u2019 he said, laying his head on the coffin in an instantly iconic gesture of national grief.\nJustin Trudeau entered politics eight years later, running for Parliament in Papineau, a working-class, multiethnic district in Montreal. Trudeau distinguished himself with hard work and an appetite for retail politics; Trudeau\u2019s father never loved pressing the flesh, but his son\u2019s greatest talent might well be his common touch. When Trudeau won that year, in an upset, it was news \u2014 but of the celebrity and nostalgia variety.\nThe younger Trudeau\u2019s road to victory as prime minister truly began on a Saturday night in 2012 in a boxing ring in Ottawa. At the time, the Liberal Party was leaderless and lost, after a devastating defeat in the election of 2011 reduced its seats in Parliament to only 34, roughly one-tenth of the total at the time. The sensible way forward seemed to be a merger with the larger New Democratic Party. Aiming to change the political dynamic, Trudeau literally picked a fight. In what looked like a publicity stunt, he challenged a 37-year-old Conservative senator named Patrick Brazeau, known as Brass Knuckles, to three rounds of boxing to raise money for cancer research.\nEveryone expected Trudeau to receive a royal beating, including his wife. Brazeau had a black belt in karate and a military background, and he grew up on hardscrabble First Nations reservations; his bar brawler\u2019s physique, tattoos and trash-talking bravado made him the three-to-one favorite by fight night.\nThat Saturday evening, the country tuned in to a conservative news channel to see Trudeau \u2014 \u2018\u2018the shiny pony,\u2019\u2019 according to the right-wing political commentator who was calling the fight \u2014 stunned by roundhouse rights and haymaker lefts from Brazeau. But then something unexpected happened: Trudeau found his feet and worked his jab. The tough-guy senator was punched out, too tired to raise his arms. His face alternated among outrage, fear and bloody-nosed confusion as Trudeau beat him senseless. The bout was stopped in the third round, saving Brazeau the indignity of hitting the canvas.\nThe commentator recognized the importance of the victory. \u2018\u2018I can hear it already,\u2019\u2019 he sighed. \u2018\u2018Trudeau for leader.\u2019\u2019\nSlipping through the streets of Ottawa on Nov. 10, six days after his swearing-in, I sat with Trudeau in a motorcade that was comically polite. His peloton of four black S.U.V.s stopped at lights, signaled respectfully, followed the speed limit and used no sirens or police escort. It was like a skit satirizing Canadian manners. We were headed to an arena packed with 16,000 youths gathered to celebrate a nonprofit called Free the Children. In a nice bit of political stagecraft, Trudeau had appointed himself minister of youth, inverting the significance of a post generally seen as marginal.\nI asked the prime minister if the fight with Brass Knuckles Brazeau had been part of a larger plan \u2014 a piece of agitprop aimed at turning around his political fortunes, and with them the nation\u2019s. Trudeau gazed out the window for a moment, contemplating, then turned to me and offered a clipped nod and a sly smile. He knew perfectly well the power of symbols and had intended to exploit that power.\n\u2018\u2018I saw it that way a little bit,\u2019\u2019 he said, his voice betraying a distinct note of guile. \u2018\u2018The fight was going to be a way of highlighting and surprising people with what I am. It wasn\u2019t about proving anything to myself \u2014 other than perhaps as a reminder that I\u2019m very good at sticking to and executing a plan. But it was a way of pointing out to people that you shouldn\u2019t underestimate me \u2014 which people have a tendency to do.\u2019\u2019\nRiding in a motorcade as he had as a boy, but never as the center of attention, Trudeau chose his words carefully. \u2018\u2018There was a perception that I\u2019d grown up with a silver spoon in my mouth,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019d boxed for 20 years on and off, so I knew that the worst-case scenario was that I was going to take a brutal beating but stay standing until at least near the end. I was confident I could take a punch. I knew I had the stamina to last three rounds. People were saying that maybe he was still smoking while he was training. I was absolutely focused on my training. One thing people are starting to realize is that I work incredibly hard at everything I set my mind to.\u2019\u2019\nOne year later, the Liberal Party elected him leader, and two years after that, the country elected him prime minister. The scale of Trudeau\u2019s underdog victory was stunning: With a comfortable majority of 184 seats in Parliament, and Liberals in seats spread across the country, he won an undeniable national mandate. As he has managed the transition from campaigning to governing, he has presented an ambitious agenda: funding infrastructure projects to stimulate the economy, supporting programs to reduce childhood poverty, investigating the disappearance and murder of more than 1,000 First Nations women, introducing a rigorous carbon-capture policy, legalizing marijuana. The Canadian system does not have the same checks and balances among branches that the American system does, so Trudeau can implement his policies without being stymied by right-wing opposition.\nAs an example of his thinking, Trudeau noted his decision to raise taxes on the top 1 percent of earners while lowering middle-class taxes, even as his government funds infrastructure improvements. He knew that Canada would run a deficit, which was unusual for a country known for fiscal probity, but he believed it was the way forward. \u2018\u2018Confident countries are willing to invest in the future,\u2019\u2019 Trudeau said, \u2018\u2018not always follow the conservative orthodoxy of balanced budgets at all costs.\u2019\u2019\nIn the face of the Syrian refugee crisis, Trudeau had pledged to bring 25,000 civilians fleeing war to Canada by the end of the year \u2014 a cry that rallied the nation in his honeymoon days. The shootings in Paris didn\u2019t change this policy, but he has decided to slow the process to ensure it is orderly and safe. (By Jan. 1, 10,000 will be admitted.) But if the Paris or San Bernardino attacks had happened in Montreal or Winnipeg before the election, he may well have lost, an illustration of the fragility of democratic institutions in the age of terror. Trudeau said he wants Canada to be free from the politics of fear and division.\n\u2018\u2018When a mosque was vandalized in a small rural community in Cold Lake, Alberta \u2014 which is as conservative as you can imagine in Canada, with the stereotypes around that \u2014 the entire town came out the next day to scrub the graffiti off the walls and help them fix the damage,\u2019\u2019 Trudeau told me. \u2018\u2018Countries with a strong national identity \u2014 linguistic, religious or cultural \u2014 are finding it a challenge to effectively integrate people from different backgrounds. In France, there is still a typical citizen and an atypical citizen. Canada doesn\u2019t have that dynamic.\u2019\u2019\nTerrorist groups have specifically said they are targeting Canada and Canadians. And on the subject of national security, Trudeau\u2019s critics say he\u2019s a lightweight and a dangerous one. Trudeau\u2019s most radical argument is that Canada is becoming a new kind of state, defined not by its European history but by the multiplicity of its identities from all over the world. His embrace of a pan-cultural heritage makes him an avatar of his father\u2019s vision. \u2018\u2018There is no core identity, no mainstream in Canada,\u2019\u2019 he claimed. \u2018\u2018There are shared values \u2014 openness, respect, compassion, willingness to work hard, to be there for each other, to search for equality and justice. Those qualities are what make us the first postnational state.\u2019\u2019\nStepping out of the S.U.V., eager to plunge into the crowd, Trudeau seemed like a man at the beginning of a very big, and very uncertain, journey. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m excited to be on the world stage,\u2019\u2019 he said, with peculiar Canadian understatement mixed with dynastic confidence. \u2018\u2018I think people are starting to see that I\u2019m actually reasonably fit for this office.\u2019\u2019",

A searchable guide to these and many other art shows is at nytimes.com/events.\nMuseums\nAmerican Folk Art Museum: \u2018A Shared Legacy: Folk Art in America\u2019  (through March 8) Drawn from a private collection, this beguiling show presents more than 60 choice objects including paintings, drawings, sculptures, furniture, painted chests and knickknacks made between 1800 and 1920. Altogether they embody a paradox for modern viewers: They evoke a world and a way of life that modernity has eclipsed, and yet they feel as vivid as anything you might desire in the art of today. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, 212-595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)\n\u2605 Brooklyn Museum: \u2018Judith Scott \u2014 Bound and Unbound\u2019  (through March 29) Judith Scott\u2019s mesmerizing sculptures sit like large, unopened bundles, contents mysterious, in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum. In a few, solid forms can be made out under wrappings of yarn, string and fabric strips; others suggest gift-wrapped boulders. You can call them abstract and stop there, or go further and connect them to art history, specifically the history of fiber art, or go further and consider them in the light of Ms. Scott\u2019s history: She was born in 1943 with Down syndrome, started making art only in her early 40s and kept making it until her death at 61. However approached, the work is complex and brilliant. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)\n\u2605 Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum (continuing) The stately doors of the 1902 Andrew Carnegie mansion, home to the Cooper Hewitt, are open again after an overhaul and expansion of the premises. Historic house and modern museum have always made an awkward fit, a standoff between preservation and innovation, and the problem remains, but the renovation has brought a wide-open new gallery space, a cafe and a raft of be-your-own-designer digital enhancements. Best of all, more of the museum\u2019s vast permanent collection is now on view, including an Op Art weaving, miniature spiral staircases, ballistic face masks and a dainty enameled 18th-century version of a Swiss knife. Like design itself, this institution is built on tumult and friction, and you feel it. 2 East 91st Street, at Fifth Avenue, 212-849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Cotter)\n\u2605 Guggenheim Museum: \u2018On Kawara \u2014 Silence\u2019  (through May 3) The first retrospective of this Conceptual Art giant turns the museum\u2019s spiral into a vortex suffused with the consciousness of time, life\u2019s supreme ruler, in all its quotidian daily unfoldings, historical events and almost incomprehensible grandeur. The presentation of date paintings, \u201cI Got Up\u201d postcards and \u201cI Am Still Alive\u201d telegrams echoes Mr. Kawara\u2019s exquisite sense of discipline and craft. This is an extraordinary tribute. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, 212-423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Roberta Smith)\n\u2605 Jewish Museum: \u2018Helena Rubinstein: Beauty Is Power\u2019 (through March 22) The first museum show devoted to the life and art collection of the cosmetics magnate Helena Rubinstein is a master class in modernism-as-marketing \u2014 one that comes with a strong female perspective on 20th-century visual culture. It shows us how Rubinstein adapted Cubism, Surrealism and other avant-garde art and design movements for her personal brand, highlighting new and different standards of beauty and exhorting women to control their own images through makeup and grooming. Mixing biography, business, art, fashion and d\u00e9cor, it recreates rooms from Rubinstein\u2019s salons and reassembles parts of her diverse collection, which included African, pre-Columbian and Oceanic artworks. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)\n\u2605 Metropolitan Museum of Art: \u2018Madame C\u00e9zanne\u2019 (through March 15) C\u00e9zanne\u2019s paintings of his wife, Hortense Fiquet, have long stonewalled would-be psychologists, offering few indications of intimacy or interior life. (The poet Rainer Maria Rilke, enthusing over \u201cMadame C\u00e9zanne in a Red Armchair,\u201d focused on the work\u2019s color scheme and called the chair \u201ca personality in its own right.\u201d) But assembled at the Met, and supported by more tender and informal graphite sketches, these portraits are more forthcoming. They suggest that numbing familiarity was actually, for C\u00e9zanne, a form of intimacy; that he could connect with portrait subjects only when they were as reliable a presence in his life as Mont Sainte-Victoire. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)\nMetropolitan Museum of Art: \u2018Making Pottery Art: The Robert A. Ellison Jr. Collection of French Ceramics (ca. 1880-1910)\u2019  (through March 15) Nearly all the 40 works in this show \u2014 from a collection recently donated to the museum \u2014 are in a traditional form of vases, bowls and platters. They represent a marvelous variety of styles and influences, including Art Nouveau, Arts and Crafts, classic Chinese traditions and European folk art. What they share is a love for processes and materials and a candid way with the human touch. Most intriguing of all is a curiously clunky small vase by Paul Gauguin, who might have been the George Ohr of European ceramics if he\u2019d stuck with it. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)\n\u2605 Metropolitan Museum of Art: \u2018Reimagining Modernism: 1900-1950\u2019 (continuing) One of the greatest encyclopedic museums in the world fulfills its mission a little more with an ambitious reinstallation of works of early European modernism with their American counterparts for the first time in nearly 30 years. Objects of design and paintings by a few self-taught artists further the integration. It is quite a sight, with interesting rotations and fine-tunings to come. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)\n\u2605 Metropolitan Museum of Art: \u2018Thomas Hart Benton\u2019s \u201cAmerica Today\u201d Mural Rediscovered\u2019 (through April 19) The prickly American Regionalist Thomas Hart Benton had his share of detractors. But even they would probably acknowledge that his early mural \u201cAmerica Today\u201d is the best of its kind, a raucous, cartwheeling, wide-angle look at 1920s America that set the standard for the Works Progress Administration\u2019s mural program and has remained a New York City treasure. Now installed at the Met in a reconstruction of its original setting (a boardroom at the New School for Social Research), it captivates with period details (from the cut of a flapper gown to the mechanics of a blast furnace) and timely signs of socioeconomic and environmental distress (exhausted coal miners and hands reaching for coffee and bread). 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)\n\u2605 Metropolitan Museum of Art: \u2018Warriors and Mothers: Epic Mbembe Art\u2019 (through Sept. 7) If a dozen masterpiece Renaissance sculptures, done in an unknown and wildly unorthodox style, suddenly turned up in the Italian countryside, the find would make the news. You\u2019ll encounter the equivalent of such a discovery in this show of spectacular weatherworn, wood-carved figures, some dating to before the 17th century, that were made by the Mbeme in southeastern Nigeria and taken to Paris by an African dealer in the early 1970s. They caused a sensation among collectors and scholars at the time, and you can see why. But the effort to find more of them proved fruitless. The examples at the Met, which include the original dozen, represent all the fully intact stand-alone Mbembe figures known to exist. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)\nMoMA PS1: \u2018Bob and Roberta Smith: Art Amnesty\u2019 (through March 23) Bob and Roberta Smith is the cognomen of a British artist who specializes in humorously mocking art institutions and the conventional attitudes they tend to promulgate. The ostensible idea of this show is to give people an opportunity to officially retire from making art and to ceremonially discard works of art they own but no longer want. Unloaded works are displayed along with jazzy signs painted by Mr. Smith on all kinds of surfaces. One proclaims, \u201cJoseph Beuys conclusive proof not everyone is an artist.\u201d 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, 718-784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)\nMoMA PS1: \u2018Samara Golden: The Flat Side of the Knife\u2019 (through Sept. 7) Standing at a railing where you look into the museum\u2019s two-story-tall Duplex Gallery, you behold a confoundingly complicated interior architecture with furniture, stairways, musical instruments, wheelchairs and many other domestic items rendered in silvery, foil-clad foam board. The gallery\u2019s floor is covered by a grid of large mirrors so that everything is doubled. What you think is up may really be down and what you take to be real might be a virtual reflection of the real. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, 718-784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)\n\u2605 Museum of Biblical Art: \u2018Sculpture in the Age of Donatello: Renaissance Masterpieces From Florence Cathedral\u2019 (through June 14) This terrific 23-piece show features three major works by the early Renaissance sculptor Donatello (1386-1466), including the life-size statue of a bald prophet known as \u201clo Zuccone\u201d or \u201cPumpkin Head,\u201d which is widely considered the sculptor\u2019s greatest work. Along with a half-dozen other works by or attributed to Donatello are sculptures by Nanni di Banco (circa 1386-1421), Donatello\u2019s main competitor, including his monumental representation in marble of St. Luke. With the addition of a series of octagonal marble reliefs by Luca della Robbia and wooden models of the Florence Cathedral\u2019s enormous dome attributed to its designer, Filippo Brunelleschi, the exhibition amounts to a tightly cropped snapshot of the birth of the Renaissance. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, 212-408-1500, mobia.org. (Johnson)\n\u2605 Museum of Modern Art: \u2018The Forever Now: Contemporary Painting in an Atemporal World\u2019 (through April 5) Despite being predictable and market-oriented in its choice of 17 artists, this museum\u2019s first painting survey in decades is well worth seeing. About half the artists are exceptional and the rest are represented by their best work. Based on the premise that all historical painting styles are equally available today, the exhibition has been smartly installed to juxtapose different approaches: figurative and abstract, digital and handmade, spare and opulent. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)\n\u2605 Museum of Modern Art: \u2018Jean Dubuffet: Soul of the Underground\u2019 (through April 5) \u201cLook at what lies at your feet!\u201d Jean Dubuffet wrote in a 1957 essay. \u201cA crack in the ground, sparkling gravel, a tuft of grass, some crushed debris, offer equally worthy subjects for your applause and admiration.\u201d In MoMA\u2019s stimulating show, drawn entirely from its collection, we can see how Dubuffet\u2019s earthbound gaze nourished his reinvention of the painted surface. On view are several canvases smeared with a mixture of oil, putty, sand and gravel, some of them with incised drawings that seem to equate painting with plowing. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)\n\u2605 Museum of Modern Art: \u2018Modern Photographs from the Thomas Walther Collection, 1909-1949\u2019 (through April 19) Overflowing with prints by Berenice Abbott, Andre Kertesz, Edward Weston and other luminaries from the first half of the 20th century, this exhibition would seem to be a straightforward look at photography\u2019s past. But the show, packaged with a book, a symposium and an engrossing interactive website, is really a bold attempt to visualize the future of photography inside the museum as it reckons with the unwieldy, image-saturated culture outside the galleries. With works by Aleksandr Rodchenko, Ms. Abbott, Alvin Langdon Coburn and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy that explore cities from unusual angles or abstract their infrastructure, the show\u2019s largest section, \u201cDynamics of the City,\u201d best encapsulates the Walther Collection\u2019s distinctly urban, peripatetic take on Modernism. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)\nMuseum of Modern Art: \u2018The Paris of Toulouse-Lautrec: Prints and Posters\u2019 (through March 22) In his printed works, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec chronicled and publicized the music halls, theaters, circuses, operas and cafes of Paris with terrific verve, sly wit and surprising subtlety. This enthralling show presents approximately 100 examples drawn from the museum\u2019s permanent collection. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)\n\u2605 Neue Galerie: \u2018Egon Schiele: Portraits\u2019 (through April 20) Of the approximately 125 items in this terrific show, there are only 11 oil paintings, which is a good thing. Except for a large picture of his wife, Edith, in a colorful striped dress, Schiele\u2019s works on canvas are dark and turgid. But his drawings are nimble and nuanced. Working on paper with pencil, charcoal, ink, gouache, watercolor and crayons, he portrayed himself and others with infectious avidity. There\u2019s hardly a single sheet here that doesn\u2019t warrant close looking for its virtuoso draftsmanship and psychological acuity. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, 212-628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Johnson)\n\u2605 New-York Historical Society: \u2018Freedom Journey 1965: Photographs of the Selma to Montgomery March by Stephen Somerstein\u2019 (through April 19) Almost 50 years ago, the picture editor of a campus newspaper at City College of New York assigned himself a breaking story: covering what promised to be a massive march in Alabama, led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., to demand free-and-clear voting rights for African-Americans. On short notice the editor, Stephen Somerstein, grabbed his cameras, climbed on a bus and headed south. The 55 pictures of black leaders and everyday people in this show, installed in a hallway and small gallery, are some that he shot that day. The image of Dr. King\u2019s head seen in monumental silhouette that has become a virtual logo of the film \u201cSelma\u201d is based on a Somerstein original. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Cotter)\n\u2605 Rubin Museum of Art: \u2018The All-Knowing Buddha: A Secret Guide\u2019 (through April 13) This show presents 54 paintings that illustrate step-by-step instructions for followers of Tibetan Buddhism. Delicately painted on 10-by-10-inch paper sheets, most of the pages depict a monk having fabulous visions in a verdant landscape. Thought to have been commissioned by a Mongolian patron and executed by unidentified artists in a Chinese workshop sometime in the 18th century, it is a fascinating and remarkably thorough manual for seekers of higher consciousness. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, 212-620-5000, rubinmuseum.org. (Johnson)\nSculpture Center: \u2018Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook\u2019  (through March 30) A pre-eminent artist in Southeast Asia, this Thai video maker addresses topics like death, the insane, East-West cultural differences, the disenfranchisement of women and the rights of animals, often in provocatively discomfiting ways. In a set of three videos, she gives professorial lectures about death to sets of real human corpses. Many of her most recent works have to do with dogs. In them, she protests the abuse of dogs and hints at a holistic vision of people in tune with nature and the cosmos. 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, 718-361-1750, sculpture-center.org. (Johnson)\nGalleries: Chelsea\n\u2018The New York School, 1969: Henry Geldzahler at the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019 (through March 14) This show revisits a large groundbreaking exhibition in 1969 organized by the Met\u2019s first curator of 20th-century art. Its radiant works evoke the big-name movers and shakers of Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art and Minimalism, while also representing art history as unquestioningly orderly, monolithic and male. Paul Kasmin, 293 10th Avenue, 212-563-4474, paulkasmingallery.com. (Smith)\nSaya Woolfalk: \u2018ChimaTEK: Hybridity Visualization System\u2019 (through March 7) This show\u2019s installation evokes the lobby of a futuristic, New Age boutique or spa. It includes paintings of psychedelically patterned kimonos, digital animations representing archetypal iconography, and exotic avatars and colorful mannequin heads decorated with bones and jewelry. Based on an imaginary cult, \u201cThe Empathics,\u201d Ms. Woolfalk\u2019s show adeptly extends the genre known as Afro-futurism, which includes the music of Sun Ra and George Clinton and the sci-fi novels by Samuel Delany and Octavia Butler. Leslie Tonkonow Artworks + Projects, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, 212-255-8450, tonkonow.com. (Johnson)\nGalleries: Other\nJames Benning and Peter Hutton (through March 8) Three slow, beautiful installations of moving images by James Benning and Peter Hutton include Mr. Benning\u2019s \u201cTulare Road\u201d (2010), which was shot digitally but includes repeating segments. Mr. Hutton\u2019s three-channel installations were shot on 16-millimeter film and transferred to video. Deep-hued and expertly composed, the films are also subtle commentaries on labor and globalization. There is footage of a ship being constructed in Korea, images taken from a ship at sea and film of workers demolishing freighters in Bangladesh \u2014 and at Orchard Street, three different forms of industry: salt miners in arid Ethiopia, farmers in the verdant Hudson Valley and repairmen in a familiarly bleak Detroit. All three exhibit a mastery of the moving picture that is arresting, instructive and impressive. Miguel Abreu Gallery, 36 Orchard Street, near Hester Street, and 88 Eldridge Street, near Grand Street, Lower East Side, miguelabreugallery.com. (Martha Schwendener)\n\u2018The Gee\u2019s Bend Tradition\u2019 (through April 24) A show of 14 quilts by seven artists, all made since 1990, and an accompanying exhibition of photographs, demonstrates what makes the Gee\u2019s Bend tradition so compelling. Unlike most quilts in the European-American tradition, which favored uniformity, harmony and precision, Gee\u2019s Bend quilts, made by generations of African-American women, include wild, improvisatory elements: broken patterns, high color contrasts, asymmetry and syncopation. They came into being alongside gospel, blues and jazz. The photographs document how the quilts are historically linked to slavery, Depression-era politics and the Civil Rights Movement, and the rich landscape in which they germinated and thrived. Lehman College Art Gallery, Lehman College, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, the Bronx, 718-960-8731, lehman.edu/gallery. (Schwendener)\nPublic Art\n\u2018Archeo\u2019 (through March) Shortening the word archaeology, this exhibition focuses on technology and obsolescence. Marianne Vitale\u2019s sculptures made from steel components of railroad switches known as frogs are one highlight; Jessica Jackson Hutchins\u2019s neo-hippie assemblages with found ceramics and a hand-woven hammock another. Across the bar from the Standard Hotel, Josh Kline takes the most activist stance, with smoothies made from prescription drugs and consumer products, while a mural by the veteran artist Ed Ruscha \u2014 a new commission separate from \u201cArcheo\u201d \u2014 announces \u201cHoney, I Twisted Through More Damn Traffic Today,\u201d perhaps capturing the ethos of the tourist-clogged High Line. At the High Line, enter at Washington and Gansevoort Streets, art.thehighline.org. (Schwendener)\nOut of Town\n\u2605 Dia:Beacon: \u2018Carl Andre: Sculpture as Place, 1958-2010\u2019 (through March 9) Minimalism was the late 20th century\u2019s great hope for a heroic American art on the Abstract Expressionism model. Carl Andre was one of Minimalism\u2019s founders. This career survey of his low-to-the-ground modular sculptures looks terrific in Dia\u2019s sonorous, sunlight-washed spaces. It also poses the question of how such monument-minded art can feel so modest, intimate \u2014 even delicate. The real treat here is the chance to see dozens of manuscript pages of Mr. Andre\u2019s 1960s poems, which he referred to as \u201ctypewriter drawings.\u201d Carefully shaped on the page in lines and blocks, they are evidence of a sculptor-to-be at work. 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., 845-440-0100, diaart.org. (Cotter)\n\u2605 National Museum of African Art: \u2018Conversations: African and African American Artists in Dialogue\u2019  (through early 2016) For its 50th anniversary, this museum has brilliantly thread together work from two sources: its own holdings in African material and the Camille O. and William H. Cosby Jr. collection of African-American art. The Cosby collection, weighted toward canonical figures like Romare Bearden and Charles White, will bring in the crowds, but it is the curators and museum itself, which is in a period of renaissance, that have made the show rise well above predictability. Smithsonian Institution, 950 Independence Avenue SW, Washington, 202-633-4600, africa.si.edu. (Cotter)\nPennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts: \u2018Peter Blume: Nature and Metamorphosis\u2019 (through April 5) Though not well-known today, Blume (1906-92) was a famous American artist during the 1930s and \u201940s. For many years his painting \u201cThe Eternal City\u201d (1934-37) was one of the most memorable artworks displayed in the permanent collection galleries of the Museum of Modern Art. A weird, technically dazzling mix of Magic and Social Realism that envisioned Rome under the Fascist reign of Mussolini, it\u2019s among the highlights of this exhibition of more than 150 works dating from 1924 to 1990. 128 North Broad Street, Philadelphia, 215-972-7600, pafa.org. (Johnson)\nLast Chance\n\u2605 Brooklyn Museum: \u2018Killer Heels: The Art of the High-Heeled Shoe\u2019 (closes on Sunday) Whether you view extra-high heels with lust or horror, as objects of empowerment or objectification, this in-depth survey of elevating footwear from past and present, East and West, is a model of the curatorial craft. It examines its subject from several fruitful angles, including unflattering ones, interspersed with excellent labels, relevant objects of art and especially design, clips from famous films and videos both didactic and artistic. Its main flaw: Dim lighting dictated by fragile materials means that some shoes are most visible in the catalog. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Smith)\n\u2018Call and Response\u2019 (closes on Saturday) The unruly state of contemporary, often youthful painting is summarized by this boisterous effort: a crowded display of 59 painters, all of whom chose which of their works would be shown. The totality resembles a juried exhibition that still needs some jurying, but subtracting what you dislike in your mind\u2019s eye still leaves quite a bit worth looking at. Gavin Brown, 620 Greenwich Street, at Leroy Street, West Village, 212-627-5258, gavinbrown.biz. (Smith)\nReuben Cox: \u2018Topical Songs\u2019 (closes on Sunday) Mr. Cox started off in the documentary mode, but in this show he turns the camera elsewhere or discards it entirely. A handful of works use the chemicals from the cyanotype process to create abstract images that look more like paintings. Mr. Cox occasionally slips back into quasi-documentary mode, however, in works like \u201ciPhone Slouch. Sunset Boulevard\u201d (2014), which updates the street-corner \u201cheroin slouch\u201d for the digital age and tracks his own move to Los Angeles from New York, and his entry into middle age. Blackston, 29C Ludlow Street, near Hester Street, Lower East Side, 212-695-8201, blackstongallery.com. (Schwendener)\nKatarzyna Kozyra: \u2018Looking for Jesus\u2019 (closes on Saturday) In \u201cLooking for Jesus,\u201d Katarzyna Kozyra\u2019s wonderful, 70-minute video, the camera follows Ms. Kozyra in Jerusalem where she finds and interviews men who believe they are Jesus. They are a fascinating bunch of eccentrics. Much of the fun is in the gentle, unthreatening way Ms. Kozyra introduces herself to her subjects, overcomes their suspicions and gets them to hold forth on how they suppose themselves to be imbued with the holy spirit. As a character in the movie, she has a subtly comical, deadpan presence. Postmasters, 54 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, 212-727-3323, postmastersart.com. (Johnson)\n\u2018Vis-\u00e0-vis\u2019  (closes on Saturday) Organized by the artist Michael Mahalchick, this exhibition staunchly ignores the boundary between outsider artists and those of the insider persuasion \u2014 among them Willem de Kooning. A very good time, full of useful parallels and connections, is had by all 16 artists. Andrew Edlin Gallery, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, 212-206-9723, edlingallery.com. (Smith)\nJim Woodring: \u2018You Drive!\u2019  (closes on Friday) Mr. Woodring is a giant in the world of comics and graphic novels. This show\u2019s assortment of recent drawings and paintings displays his extraordinary gifts as a draughtsman, storyteller and creator of hilarious characters, including Frank, a hapless, accident-prone innocent. It includes 15 original pages from \u201cFran,\u201d about a female version of Frank with whom he has a tempestuous love affair that ends badly early in the story. This propels him into a picaresque quest to retrieve his lost love in a psychedelic world populated by monsters, demons and bizarre objects and architecture.

    "text": "Jihad and Girl Power: How ISIS Lured 3 London Girls\n2015-08-17T09:00:42.000Z\nLONDON \u2014 The night before Khadiza Sultana left for Syria she was dancing in her teenage bedroom. It was a Monday during the February school vacation. Her niece and close friend, at 13 only three years younger than Khadiza, had come for a sleepover. The two girls wore matching pajamas and giggled as they gyrated in unison to the beat. \nKhadiza offered her niece her room that night and shared a bed with her mother. She was a devoted daughter, particularly since her father had died.\nThe scene in her bedroom, saved on the niece\u2019s cellphone on Feb. 16 and replayed dozens of times by Khadiza\u2019s relatives since, shows the girl they thought they knew: joyful, sociable, funny and kind.\nAs it turned out, it was also the carefully choreographed goodbye of a determined and exceptionally bright teenager who had spent months methodically planning to leave her childhood home in Bethnal Green, East London, with two schoolmates and follow the path of another friend who had already traveled to the territory controlled by the Islamic State.\nOn Tuesday morning, Khadiza got up early and put on the Lacoste perfume both she and her niece liked. She told her mother that she was going to school to pick up some workbooks and spend the day in the library. She grabbed a small day pack and promised to return by 4:30 p.m.\nIt was only that night that the family realized something was wrong. When Khadiza had not come back by 5:30, her mother asked her oldest sister, Halima Khanom, to message her, but there was no reply. Ms. Khanom drove to the library to look for her sister, but she was not there. She went to the school, but the staff said no student had come in that day.\nBy the time she came back home, her mother had checked Khadiza\u2019s wardrobe and found that besides some strategically arranged items it was empty. \u201cThat\u2019s when I started panicking,\u201d Ms. Khanom, 32, said in a recent interview at the family home. Two tote bags were missing from the house. \u201cShe must have taken her things gradually and packed a suitcase somewhere else.\u201d\nEarly the next morning her family reported Khadiza missing. An hour later, three officers from SO15, the counterterrorism squad of the Metropolitan Police, knocked on the door. \u201cWe believe your daughter has traveled to Turkey with two of her friends,\u201d one said.\nEven then, Ms. Khanom said, recalling the conversation, \u201cSyria didn\u2019t come into my mind.\u201d\nThe next time she saw her sister was on the news: Grainy security camera footage showed Khadiza and her two 15-year-old friends, Shamima Begum and Amira Abase, calmly passing through security at Gatwick Airport for Turkish Airlines Flight 1966 to Istanbul and later boarding a bus to the Syrian border.\n\u201cOnly when I saw that video I understood,\u201d Ms. Khanom said.\nThese images turned the three Bethnal Green girls, as they have become known, into the face of a new, troubling phenomenon: young women attracted to what experts like Sasha Havlicek, a co-founder and the chief executive of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, call a jihadi, girl-power subculture. \nAn estimated 4,000 Westerners have traveled to Syria and Iraq, more than 550 of them women and girls, to join the Islamic State, according to a recent report by the institute, which helps manage the largest database of female travelers to the region.\nThe men tend to become fighters much like previous generations of jihadists seeking out battlefields in Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq. But less is known about the Western women of the Islamic State. Barred from combat, they support the group\u2019s state-building efforts as wives, mothers, recruiters and sometimes online cheerleaders of violence.\nMany are single and young, typically in their teens or early 20s (the youngest known was 13). Their profiles differ in terms of socioeconomic background, ethnicity and nationality, but often they are more educated and studious than their male counterparts. Security officials now say they may present as much of a threat to the West as the men: Less likely to be killed and more likely to lose a spouse in combat, they may try to return home, indoctrinated and embittered.\nOne in four of the women in the Institute for Strategic Dialogue\u2019s database are already widowed. But if women are a strategic asset for the Islamic State, they are hardly ever considered in most aspects of Western counterterrorism.\nThe Bethnal Green girls, slender teenagers with ready smiles and London accents, were praised by teachers and admired by fellow students at Bethnal Green Academy.\nKhadiza, with straight chocolate-colored hair and thick-rimmed glasses, had been singled out as one of the most promising students of her academic year, according to a letter her mother received after mock exams only weeks before she left. In her bedroom, she kept a copy of a novel that a teacher had given to her with a handwritten dedication inside, dated January 2015: \u201cWell done for working hard and exceeding your target grade for English language.\u201d In her spare time she tutored less-gifted peers.\nHer bubbly friend Amira was a star athlete and a respected public speaker, once debating the rights of Muslim women to wear veils. She was a regular at the local library, where she read voraciously. (After her disappearance, when the police went to check the list of books she had borrowed, one title, \u201cInsurgent,\u201d briefly rang alarm bells \u2014 until the officer realized that it was part of a popular dystopian teenage trilogy set in Chicago.)\n\u201cThey were the girls you wanted to be like,\u201d said one 14-year-old from the grade below theirs.\nPerhaps that is why everyone failed to respond to the many signs that foreshadowed their dark turn. The families, who noticed the girls\u2019 behavior changing, attributed it to teenage whims; school staff members, who saw their homework deteriorate, failed to inform the parents or intervene; the police, who spoke to the girls twice about their friend who had traveled to Syria, also never notified the parents.\nThey were smart, popular girls from a world in which teenage rebellion is expressed through a radical religiosity that questions everything around them. In this world, the counterculture is conservative. Islam is punk rock. The head scarf is liberating. Beards are sexy.\nAsk young Muslim women in their neighborhood what kind of guys are popular at school these days and they start raving about \u201cthe brothers who pray.\u201d\n\u201cGirls used to want someone who is good-looking; nowadays, girls want Muslims who are practicing,\u201d said Zahra Qadir, 22, who does deradicalization work for the Active Change Foundation, her father\u2019s charity in East London. \u201cIt\u2019s a new thing over the last couple of years. A lot of girls want that, even some nonpracticing girls.\u201d\nThe rows of housing complexes behind Bethnal Green\u2019s main street are home to a deeply conservative Muslim community where the lines between religion and extremism can be blurred, including in at least one of the girls\u2019 families. In this community, the everyday challenges that girls face look very different from those of their male counterparts.\nThe Islamic State is making a determined play for these girls, tailoring its siren calls to their vulnerabilities, frustrations and dreams, and filling a void the West has so far failed to address.\nIn post-9/11 austerity Britain, a time when a deep crisis of identity and values has swept the country, fitting in can be harder for Muslim girls than for boys. Buffeted by a growing hostility toward Islam and deep spending cuts that have affected women and young people in working-class communities like their own, they have come to resent the Western freedoms and opportunities their parents sought out. They see Western fashions sexualizing girls from an early age, while Western feminists look at the hijab as a symbol of oppression.\nAsked by their families during sporadic phone calls and exchanges on social media platforms why they had run away, the girls spoke of leaving behind an immoral society to search for religious virtue and meaning. In one Twitter message, nine days before they left Britain, Amira wrote,\u201cI feel like I don\u2019t belong in this era.\u201d\nMuslim girls generally outperform the boys in school but are kept on a shorter leash at home. Many, like Khadiza, have sisters whose marriages were arranged when they were teenagers. Ms. Khanom, now 32, was 17 when she was wed, just a year older than Khadiza. And they wear head scarves, which identify them as Muslims in often-hostile streets.\nIn their world, going to Syria and joining the so-called caliphate is a way of \u201ctaking control of your destiny,\u201d said Tasnime Akunjee, a lawyer who represents the families of the three girls.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about choice \u2014 the most human thing,\u201d Mr. Akunjee said. \u201cThese girls are smart, they are A students. When you are smarter than everyone else, you think you can do anything.\u201d\nSince they left their homes, bits and pieces have emerged about the three friends revealing a blend of youthful na\u00efvet\u00e9 and determination.\nKhadiza\u2019s friend Amira \u201cfell in love with the idea of falling in love,\u201d a family acquaintance said. At one point, she posted the image of a Muslim couple with a caption: \u201cAnd he created you in pairs.\u201d\nKhadiza, by contrast, told her sister in one of the first Instagram conversations after her arrival in Syria, \u201cI\u2019m not here just to get married.\u201d\nThe Islamic State has proved adept at appealing to different female profiles, using girl-to-girl recruitment strategies, gendered imagery and iconic memes.\nAs Muslims, the girls would be treated very differently from women and girls of the Yazidi minority, who are taken by the Islamic State as slaves and raped with the justification that they are unbelievers.\nThe group runs a \u201cmarriage bureau\u201d for single Western women. This year, the media wing of Al Khanssaa Brigade, an all-female morality militia, published a manifesto stipulating that women complete their formal education at age 15 and that they can be married as young as 9, but also praising their existence in the Islamic State as \u201challowed.\u201d\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the self-proclaimed caliph of the Islamic State, took a young German woman of Iraqi descent as his third wife and put her in charge of women\u2019s issues in the caliphate, according to information circulating among Islamic State-affiliated social media accounts.\nSocial media has allowed the group\u2019s followers to directly target young women, reaching them in the privacy of their bedrooms with propaganda that borrows from Western pop culture \u2014 images of jihadists in the sunset and messages of empowerment. A recent post linked to an Islamic State account paraphrased a popular L\u2019Or\u00e9al makeup ad next to the image of a girl in a head scarf: \u201cCOVERed GIRL. Because I\u2019m worth it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a twisted version of feminism,\u201d said Ms. Havlicek of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, who testified about Western women under the jihadi group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on July 29.\n\u201cFor the girls, joining ISIS is a way to emancipate yourself from your parents and from the Western society that has let you down,\u201d Ms. Havlicek said. \u201cFor ISIS, it\u2019s great for troop morale because fighters want Western wives. And in the battle of ideas they can point to these girls and say, Look, they are choosing the caliphate over the West.\u201d\nA Friend\u2019s Departure\nIn January 2014, one of Khadiza\u2019s best friends, Sharmeena Begum, no relation to Shamima, lost her mother to cancer. Her father soon started courting a woman who would become his second wife.\nAn only child, Sharmeena was deeply shaken. Until then, she had not been very religious, friends say. \u201cShe was barely practicing before,\u201d according to one acquaintance of the family. After her mother died, she started praying regularly and spending more time at the mosque.\nBut there were signs she was not just turning toward religion for comfort. Bethnal Green Academy is a state-funded secondary school with just over 900 students, the majority of them Muslim. At one point last year, Sharmeena had a heated exchange with a teacher, defending the Islamic State. The teacher, also a Muslim, disagreed, and Sharmeena \u201cflipped out,\u201d a witness said.\nHer closest friends started changing, too.\nKhadiza stopped wearing trousers and began covering her hair after the summer vacation, at first only in school but gradually at home as well. It was a big change for a girl who \u201cloved\u201d her hair and styled the women in her family on festive occasions.\nOne day last fall, she asked her older brother Shuyab Alom, a science student who sometimes helped her with homework, what his thoughts were on Syria.\n\u201cShe asked a very general question as to what I thought about what\u2019s happening over there,\u201d Mr. Alom recalled. \u201cAnd I said how it was, the fact that it seems that the Syrian regime, you know, the majority of the people oppose the regime.\u201d\nAround the same time, other friends at school noticed the girls\u2019 lunchtime conversations changing. One friend, whose passport has since been seized because it was feared that she, too, might go to Syria (she denies this), reported a \u201cnoticeable\u201d change in attitude.\nWhen Sharmeena\u2019s father remarried in the fall, Khadiza accompanied her to the wedding. Soon after, on Saturday, Dec. 6, Sharmeena disappeared.\n\u201cShe was vulnerable; she had a trauma,\u201d said Mr. Akunjee, the lawyer, who does not represent Sharmeena\u2019s family but is familiar with her case. \u201cShe didn\u2019t get a body piercing or a drug-dealer boyfriend. She went to ISIS.\u201d\nKhadiza did not tell her family that Sharmeena had run away. When a school staff member called to inform the family that Khadiza\u2019s friend had \u201cgone missing,\u201d the official did not specify that she was believed to have traveled to Syria, Ms. Khanom, Khadiza\u2019s sister, recalled.\nHer mother asked Khadiza regularly whether she had received news of her friend. \u201cAnd she\u2019d be like, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know,\u2019\u201d Ms. Khanom said. \u201cAnd I thought that was weird.\u201d\nSharmeena\u2019s father, Mohammad Uddin, said he had been surprised that the other girls had not left with his daughter. He told The Daily Mail he had urged the police and the school to keep a close eye on them, though the police say the formal statement Mr. Uddin gave to them on Feb. 10 \u2014 a week before the three girls left \u2014 held no such warning.\nAt the time, one officer was charged with getting in touch with the girls, but they were \u201cuncooperative\u201d and did not return his calls and messages. He asked the school to set up meetings with them and four other friends. Two meetings took place, one in the presence of the deputy principal and one with a teacher. But even then, Ms. Khanom said, neither the school nor the police told the families exactly what was going on.\nAsked about failing to spot the signs of the girls\u2019 radicalization, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police maintained that there had been no indication in the interviews that any of them \u201cwere in any way vulnerable or indeed radicalized.\u201d\n\u201cThere was no indication that any of the girls were at risk of traveling to Syria,\u201d the spokesman said.\nOn Feb. 5, officers gave letters to the girls, seeking their parents\u2019 permission to take formal statements from them about Sharmeena\u2019s disappearance. But the girls never passed the letters on. Khadiza\u2019s was discovered by her sister hidden in textbooks in her bedroom after they had left.\nMs. Khanom was furious. \u201cI saw the guy who gave her the letter. He said the 15-year-olds were giving him a runaround. And I\u2019m like: \u2018You\u2019re supposed to be someone who\u2019s trained in counterterrorism, you know. We don\u2019t understand about 15-year-olds giving you a runaround. How does that work?\u2019 \u201d \nEventually the police issued an apology. The commissioner, Bernard Hogan-Howe, said he was sorry that the letters had never reached the parents. A spokesman added, \u201cWith the benefit of hindsight, we acknowledge that the letters could have been delivered direct to the parents.\u201d\nAs the police and the school were keeping Sharmeena\u2019s suspected travel to Syria quiet, Khadiza and her friends began planning to follow in her footsteps.\nGirls\u2019 Pact and Missed Signs\nIn messy handwriting on a page ripped out of a calendar, the girls made a detailed checklist for their trip: bras, a cellphone, an epilator, makeup and warm clothes, among other things. Next to each item, they noted cost, including just over 1,000 pounds for tickets to Turkey.\nDiscovered at the bottom of one of the girls\u2019 closets after their departure, the list also appears to contain the handwriting of a fourth girl who had apparently planned to travel but dropped out when her father had a stroke. Since then, a judge has confiscated the passports belonging to her, three other students at Bethnal Green Academy and a fifth girl from the neighborhood.\nLike other teenagers, the girls were sensitive to peer pressure. They were what Shiraz Maher, a senior fellow at the International Center for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence, called a textbook \u201ccluster,\u201d making the multiple oversights by the school and the police even more surprising.\nIf one member of a group of friends has gone to Syria, Mr. Maher said, that is a far more reliable predictor of the friends being at risk of going than variables like class or ethnicity. In clusters like the Bethnal Green group, doubts are drowned out and views quickly reinforced.\nMr. Akunjee, the lawyer, said, \u201cFrom December it is pretty clear that there is a pact between the girls.\u201d\nPlanning their trip appears to have occupied much of their time. Their homework, diligently completed before Sharmeena\u2019s departure, came back incomplete in the weeks after.\n\u201cI\u2019m amazed that the teachers and police missed that,\u201d said Mr. Akunjee, who reviewed the homework. \u201cThese are bright girls. Well above average clever. This was a year with exams coming up. Shouldn\u2019t the school have informed the parents?\u201d It is a question the police are asking the school, too.\nKhadiza and her friend Amira exchanged many messages on social media. In one post, Amira described the two of them as \u201ctwins.\u201d In a tweet dated Dec. 20, she posted a hadith on being in a group of three friends: \u201cIf you are three (in number), then let not two engage in private, excluding the third.\u201d \nWas Amira worried about her two friends speaking without her and questioning their pact to go to Syria? She was perhaps the most active of the three friends on social media, providing glimpses of the gradual radicalization the group underwent.\nIn her posts, under the name Umm Uthman Britaniya, typical teenage commentary about fashion, school and her favorite soccer club (Chelsea) increasingly mixed with posts inquiring about how to learn Arabic quickly and what behavior is or is not Islamic.\n\u201cAre nose piercings Haram or not?\u201d one of her posts asked on Dec. 30, meaning were they forbidden under Islam. \u201cConnnfuuuusseedddd.\u201d Two weeks later she wrote, \u201cThe Prophet (PBUH) cursed those who pluck their eyebrows.\u201d\nBut far from portraying an increasingly submissive girl, Amira\u2019s Twitter messages featured punchy fist emoticons and empowered language: \u201cOur abaya game\u201d she wrote under a photo of four girls proudly clad in Muslim garb, is \u201cstrong.\u201d In January, she wrote about rape: \u201cHearing these stories of sisters being raped makes me so close to being allergic to men, Wallah.\u201d\nAround the same time, Khadiza\u2019s family noticed that she became \u201cmore quiet.\u201d\n\u201cShe spent a lot of time on her iPod,\u201d her sister, Ms. Khanom, recalled. The iPod had been the subject of a dispute between Khadiza and her mother a year earlier. Khadiza had asked for one, but her mother had said no. It took Ms. Khanom to lobby on her behalf.\nOn her iPod she received a steady stream of images depicting atrocities against Muslim children, from Syria to Myanmar. Her friend Amira posted and reposted several. One of her posts, a photo of a 3-year-old boy, was captioned, \u201cThis always gets to me.\u201d\n\u201cAlmost every day, I go on Facebook and I\u2019m shown a horrible post somewhere,\u201d Khadiza\u2019s brother, Mr. Alom, said. \u201cOnline you have whole pages and groups and accounts dedicated to these sort of things, where they post pictures, they post videos.\u201d\nA lot of young Muslims, he said, feel that \u201cIslamophobia is a very prevalent thing.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then a group comes to them and says, like: \u2018This is where you come,\u2019 this is where they will be complete. \u2018It\u2019s a home for you.\u2019 That appeals to them.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cYeah, that\u2019s the main thing, because a lot of people feel that they are out of place to where they are.\u201d\nBethnal Green is only one subway stop from the moneyed towers of the City of London and stretches into the capital\u2019s trendy start-up district. Bearded hipsters are a common sight among the bustling market stalls selling everything from saris to spices.\nBut four in 10 residents, including Khadiza\u2019s and Shamima\u2019s families, have roots in Bangladesh. (Amira was born in Ethiopia and spent her early childhood in Germany before moving here when she was 11.) A literalist interpretation of Islam promoted by Saudi Arabia has become more mainstream and has combined with a widely shared sense that Muslims across the world suffer injustices in which the West is complicit.\nAfter the girls vanished, it emerged that Amira\u2019s father, Hussen Abase, had been filmed attending an Islamist rally in 2012 organized by a notorious hate preacher, Anjem Choudary, and also attended by Michael Adebowale, one of the two men who hacked a British soldier to death on a London Street in 2013. In the video Mr. Abase, who in March appeared on British television sobbing and cradling his daughter\u2019s teddy bear and begging her to come home, can be seen chanting \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d (\u201cGod is great\u201d) as an American flag is burned nearby.\nHe occasionally took Amira to marches, too. Among the people she followed on Twitter was Mohammed Mizanur Rahman, who has close links to Mr. Choudary. Both men were charged this month with supporting the Islamic State. Mr. Abase did not respond to an interview request.\n\u201cSome parents create the atmosphere for their children,\u201d said Haras Rafiq, the managing director of the Quilliam Foundation, an anti-extremism research center.\nAs Amira became more vocal on Twitter, Khadiza became more argumentative at home, on occasion scolding older siblings for acting \u201cun-Islamic\u201d or pressing her niece to disobey her mother.\nThe last time Ms. Khanom saw her sister was five days before she left. Her cousin Fahmida Abdul Aziz had come over, too. \u201cWe were fighting over a bag of Bombay mix,\u201d Ms. Khanom said, referring to a traditional Indian snack. \u201cShe loves that. I guess she gets that off my dad, because my dad used to love it, too.\u201d\nThey were sitting on the living room sofa. \u201cShe was in her PJs, you know like a T-shirt and a pajama bottom, and she just literally came, sat herself between the two of us and put her arms around us,\u201d the cousin, Ms. Aziz said, smiling at the memory. \u201cYou know, just looked at me and just gave me a cuddle.\u201d\nThe next day, Khadiza asked that her niece come to stay, but Ms. Khanom, the niece\u2019s mother, said no because it was a school night. Uncharacteristically, she said, Khadiza texted her niece, urging her to disobey: \u201cJust jump on the bus and come.\u201d\nThat same week, Amira implored her Twitter followers in capital letters: \u201cPRAY ALLAH GRANTS ME THE HIGHEST RANKS IN JANNAH, MAKES ME SINCERE IN MY WORSHIP AND KEEPS ME STEADFAST.\u201d She posted a photo of three girls in black head scarves and abayas in a local park with their backs to the camera, presumably her and her two friends. \u201cSisters,\u201d the caption reads.\nCall Home, Girls\nOn Feb. 15, just two days before the three girls left, Shamima sent a Twitter message to a prominent Islamic State recruiter from Glasgow, Aqsa Mahmood. The youngest of the three, Shamima is also the most elusive. Little is known about her apart from the fact that she loved to watch \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians\u201d and traveled to Turkey on the passport of her 17-year-old sister, Aklima.\nMs. Mahmood, who goes by the name Umm Layth (meaning Mother of the Lion) and provides advice on social media to would-be female migrants, has denied recruiting the girls. But her parents\u2019 lawyer expressed surprise that the security services, believed to be monitoring Ms. Mahmood\u2019s social media accounts, had not reacted to Shamima\u2019s approach.\nKhadiza\u2019s family members say it is unlikely that the girls could have raised an estimated 3,000 pounds, or about $4,700, to cover the cost of their trip on their own. The plane tickets alone, police confirmed, cost more than 1,000 pounds and were paid for in cash at a local travel agency.\nUnlike the friend who left earlier, Sharmeena, who had an inheritance from her mother, the three girls had no known source of money, raising questions about whether they were recruited and had outside help.\nA suggestion by the counterterrorism chief of the Metropolitan Police, Mark Rowley, that the girls might have stolen from the families did not go down well: \u201cI felt like punching them; that was a blatant lie,\u201d Khadiza\u2019s sister said.\n\u201cKhadiza took some of her jewelry but nothing expensive,\u201d Ms. Khanom said. She left behind the most precious item she owned, a Swarovski necklace she had gotten for her most recent birthday. She did not touch the money in her sister\u2019s bag in the hallway that morning and took nothing from her mother\u2019s kitty.\n\u201cNothing was missing,\u201d Ms. Khanom said.\nThe police are still trying to establish whether the girls had help online or from a local recruiter. The trouble, investigators say, is that traveling to a conflict zone is not a crime in Britain, nor is encouraging or facilitating travel to a conflict zone, unless a terrorist purpose can be proven.\n\u201cIf a local facilitator is identified, a likelier ground for prosecution might be child abduction,\u201d a senior officer said.\nThe families\u2019 lawyer is convinced the girls tapped into a shadowy recruitment network embedded in and protected by the community in East London and were then handled \u201cpoint to point.\u201d\nIn shaky footage, apparently filmed on a hidden camera near the Syrian border and broadcast on A Haber, a Turkish television network, the girls are seen alongside a man in a maroon hooded sweatshirt. Another man, bearded and bespectacled, takes bags out of the trunk of one car and helps load them into another.\n\u201cThis car,\u201d he seems to tell them in heavily accented English, then apparently directs them to take passports allowing them into Syria.\nThe girls, who arrived in Turkey on a Tuesday night and were reported missing by early Wednesday, waited 18 hours at a bus station in an Istanbul suburb and crossed into Syria only on Friday. Police in both Britain and Turkey have faced accusations of reacting too slowly.\nEventually the Turkish police arrested a man on allegations that he had helped the teenagers cross the border. The Turkish news agency Dogan said the man had helped several other Britons cross into Syria for a fee between $800 and $1,500.\n\u201cThis is not a package holiday,\u201d Mr. Akunjee said. \u201cIt is a complicated journey.\u201d\nHe knows this firsthand. One of the first things he did after the families hired him was to travel with relatives of all three girls to Turkey and make a public appeal to the girls to get in touch. The campaign, publicized with the hashtag #callhomegirls, was widely covered in the British press.\n\u201cEven I needed fixers to help me set it all up,\u201d said Mr. Akunjee, who knows Turkey well. (He recently negotiated the release of a British girl held hostage by the Nusra Front.) \u201cThere is no way the girls did this on their own.\u201d\nKhadiza\u2019s sister, Ms. Khanom, was among those who traveled to Turkey. \u201cIt was like we were retracing their steps,\u201d she said. When the appeal went out, the families learned that 53 other women and girls were believed to have left Britain for Syria.\n\u201cFifty-three,\u201d Ms. Khanom said. \u201cWhere are all these girls?\u201d\nFirst Contact\nThe morning after the families returned to London, a message popped up on Ms. Khanom\u2019s Instagram account. Her request to follow her sister, blocked since Khadiza had left for Syria, had been accepted.\nMs. Khanom said she sent Khadiza a private message, asking to let her know that she was safe. Her sister replied and later messaged again, asking about their mother.\n\u201cShe is on her prayer mat asking Allah to help her find you,\u201d Ms. Khanom wrote.\n\u201cI\u2019ll call soon okay,\u201d Khadiza replied.\n\u201cShe has not been sleeping or eating since you left,\u201d her sister wrote.\n\u201cTell her to eat.\u201d\n\u201cShe is asking do you not want to see her?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I do.\u201d\nBut Khadiza also seemed suspicious of the families\u2019 trip to Turkey, making Ms. Khanom wonder if it was really her sister messaging her. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way of asking questions about what happened in Turkey: Why did I go? Those kind of things. It just felt like, why would she be asking me these questions, you know.\u201d\nAt one point, Ms. Khanom tested her: \u201cWho is Big Toe?\u201d she asked. Khadiza sent back a \u201clol\u201d and replied: \u201cOur cousin.\u201d\nFor a moment it was as if they were back in the same city. \u201cI kind of forgot she\u2019s not here,\u201d Ms. Khanom said.\nShe asked her sister to keep in touch. Khadiza promised she would, but insisted that it would always be her initiating contact. \u201cI don\u2019t think she has full freedom,\u201d Ms. Khanom said.\nThe next day, Khadiza messaged again.\n\u201cI asked her, \u2018Are you married?\u2019 She goes: \u2018You know me too well. I\u2019m not here just to get married to someone,\u2019\u201d Ms. Khanom recalled. Khadiza said she was \u201cconsidering.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean by considering?\u201d Ms. Khanom recalled asking.\n\u201cLooking into getting married,\u201d the reply came.\n\u201cWhen?\u201d\n\u201cSoon.\u201d\nFrom these early conversations, and descriptions of the food they were eating \u2014 fried chicken, French fries and pizza \u2014 the families and authorities concluded that the three girls were in Raqqa, the de facto capital of the Islamic State, housed in one of several hostels for single women. Khadiza said she was living in a nice house \u201cwith chandeliers.\u201d\nMs. Khanom pleaded with her to come home, telling her that the police had assured the families that the girls would not face prosecution.\nKhadiza did not believe it. \u201cThey\u2019re lying,\u201d she told her sister.\nNo Way Back?\nAt Bethnal Green Academy, a school with a fine academic record, now notorious for having four of its students join the Islamic State, the departure of the girls is gingerly referred to as \u201cthe incident.\u201d\nIn the week after they ran away, the principal, Mark Keary, called an assembly. Students were upset, and some teachers cried. But it quickly became clear that this was not a place where the issue of the girls\u2019 departure would be openly discussed. As Mr. Keary put it that same week, it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for the school.\n\u201cHe brushed over it,\u201d said one girl who had attended the assembly. Teachers have been threatened with dismissal if they speak out publicly, people in the school said. Mr. Keary declined to comment.\nTwo weeks after the girls disappeared, the phone rang at the help line of the Active Change Foundation, the organization working on deradicalization and prevention.\nIt was the father of a student at Bethnal Green Academy. His daughter had overheard a group of girls at lunchtime talking about going to Syria. He said it appeared they were in contact with the girls already there and were planning to join them over the Easter holiday. Hanif Qadir, who runs the charity, informed the local council. On March 20, a judge took away the girls\u2019 passports.\nIt was an early indication that Khadiza, Amira and Shamima seemed to be settling into life in Raqqa.\nSince then, all three girls have married, their families\u2019 lawyer confirmed. They were given a choice among a number of Western men. One chose a Canadian, another a European. Amira married Abdullah Elmir, a former butcher from Australia, who has appeared in several ISIS recruitment videos and has been named \u201cginger jihadi\u201d for his reddish hair.\nAll three have moved out of the hostel and live with their husbands. They have sporadic contact with home. The conversations give the impression that the girls have few regrets about leaving their lives in London. But they also hint at hardships like frequent electricity cuts and shortages of Western goods. One recent chat came to an abrupt end because airstrikes were starting.\nKhadiza told her sister that she still wanted to become a doctor. There is a medical school in Raqqa, she said. The logo for the Islamic State Health Service mimics the blue-and-white logo of Britain\u2019s treasured National Health Service.\nIn a recent online exchange on Twitter and Kik with a British tabloid reporter posing as a schoolgirl interested in going to Syria, Amira gave instructions that appeared to track her own experience: She advised the \u201cgirl\u201d to tell her parents that she was going for review classes to escape the house, then fly to Turkey and take a bus to Gaziantep, where she could be smuggled across the border. She recommended a travel agent in Brick Lane, a short walk from Bethnal Green Academy, which would accept cash and ask no questions, and suggested taking along bras because \u201cthey have the worst bras here.\u201d\nShe also asked if the would-be recruit would consider becoming a second wife to a Lebanese-Australian, a description fitting her own husband, and appeared to mock a minute of silence for the mostly British victims of a recent shooting in Tunisia for which the Islamic State claimed responsibility, with \u201cLooooool,\u201d shorthand for \u201claugh out loud.\u201d\nIt is getting harder to know if it is the girls who are communicating. Increasingly their conversations are interspersed with stock propagandistic phrases.\n\u201cHave they adapted that language, or is there someone standing next to them?\u201d Mr. Akunjee asked. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. But they\u2019re not the people their families recognize. They\u2019re not them anymore. And how could they be?\u201d\nStanding in her sister\u2019s bedroom one recent afternoon Ms. Khanom recalled the girl who had watched \u201cThe Princess Diaries\u201d at least four times and loved Zumba dancing in the living room.\nHer room is unchanged; perfumes and teenage accessories remain on a small chest. Her exam schedule is still taped to the inside of her closet door: math, statistics, history, English. A checkered scarf, which Khadiza had dropped on the morning of her departure in the hallway outside, is neatly folded on a shelf. It still carries her scent.\nThere are frames filled with photos of her sisters and her nephew, as well as her niece, who has taken her departure particularly badly.\n\u201cShe\u2019s very affected by it, she misses her terribly, Khalummy \u2014 that\u2019s what she calls her, Khalummy,\u201d Ms. Khanom said, referring to a Bengali term of endearment for aunt. \u201cYou know, sometimes she shows anger, sometimes she thinks that, you know, she could have stopped her that morning. She saw her get ready.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say they\u2019re memories because. ...,\u201d Ms Khanom said, her eyes traveling across her sister\u2019s things. \u201cThey\u2019re memories, but not as if, like. ...,\u201d her voice trailing off again. \u201cI hope and I feel she\u2019s going to come back and things are going to go back to normal.\u201d",

    "text": "When Food Is Genetically Modified\n2015-05-04T07:21:19.000Z\nTo the Editor:\nRe \u201cHow I Got Converted to G.M.O. Food\u201d (Sunday Review, April 26):\nMark Lynas claims that there is a scientific consensus on the safety of consuming G.M.O. plants. There is nothing intrinsically safe or dangerous when genes from distant species are introduced into plants. Each genetically modified food is a separate entity that must be independently and rigorously tested to ensure its safety.\nUnfortunately, current United States regulations do not require such testing, and the majority of studies supporting the writer\u2019s claims have either been funded or produced by industry. To even speak of G.M.O.\u2019s as a single entity that can be called \u201csafe\u201d to consume or good for the environment is entirely unscientific.\nSHELDON KRIMSKY\nJEREMY GRUBER\nNew York\n \nThe writers are, respectively, chairman and president of the Council for Responsible Genetics. They are co-editors of the book \u201cThe G.M.O. Deception.\u201d \nTo the Editor:\nIt\u2019s hard to argue that, in the case of an impoverished Bangladeshi farmer, we should ban genetically modified eggplant that may markedly improve his livelihood. Here, science is being used in ways that improve farmers\u2019 lives and, we hope, can spread better nutrition, food security and other benefits to third-world people.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum sits Roundup Ready corn, which is genetically modified solely so that Roundup, an herbicide manufactured by the same company (Monsanto) as the seed, may be sprayed directly on the crop. This is a reprehensible, profit-driven concept.\nLet\u2019s clarify that G.M.O.s have their place, assuming there is a significant public benefit. But nobody benefits from Roundup Ready corn but Monsanto.\nJASON WALKER\nMinneapolis\n \nThe writer works for the Sustainable Farming Association.\nTo the Editor:\nMark Lynas\u2019s profile of one farmer in Bangladesh does not represent the facts on the ground about genetically engineered eggplant there. The trials of the new variety of eggplant have actually had very poor results: Genetic engineering did not protect plants from most pests and have led to crop loss and debt for farmers.\nOn the other hand, across Bangladesh and the broader region, farmers who are using agroecological principles, working with farmer-to-farmer networks like Navdanya in India, are achieving high yields with little to no use of chemical pesticides.\nIn my own reporting on food and agricultural issues, I\u2019ve met farmers in Bangladesh, India, Brazil, Poland, Kenya, Mali and other countries around the world who are reporting the powerful results of ecological farming, using conventional breeding and traditional seed saving and sharing. Farmers are seeing their yields go up, while learning a way of farming that doesn\u2019t lock them into dependency on seed and fertilizer companies half a world away or expose them to harmful chemicals in the fields.\nMr. Lynas\u2019s Bangladesh visit was organized by the new Cornell Alliance for Science, funded by a $5.6 million grant from the Gates Foundation, that is promoting biotechnology, not dispassionately reviewing the science.\nANNA LAPP\u00c9\nBerkeley, Calif.\n \nThe writer is a founding principal of the Small Planet Institute. \nTo the Editor: \nMark Lynas is pro-science, as are we, but he ignores some vexing problems. Asserting that biotech is safe is like saying that electricity is safe. Genetic engineering can be used safely or stupidly. Scientists, corporations and government agencies try to avoid the latter, and regulators need strong scientific data to evaluate risks.\nFor example, many claim that genes from transgenic eggplant can be confined. In India, however, we recently found that eggplant can cross-pollinate with its closest wild relative (Solanum insanum), a roadside weed with edible fruits. Pollinating bees, seed dispersal and human intervention could allow engineered genes from eggplant to proliferate in episodes of \u201cgene flow\u201d that cannot be controlled.\nMr. Lynas also makes no mention of the regulatory, political and economic headaches that would ensue if open-pollinated Bt eggplant from Bangladesh is transported across national boundaries. Nor does he show respect for people who simply want to know whether they are eating G.M. food.\nALLISON A.
