[{"text": "Studies Seek Flood Control In Bangladesh\n1989-07-06T05:00:00.000Z\nAs monsoon rains begin to fall again on Bangladesh, the World Bank is mobilizing an international force of scientists and aid officials to draft a comprehensive, long-term plan to save this vulnerable nation from perennial catastrophe.\nWith the height of the flood season still a few weeks away, 58 villages were destroyed in late June by rising water and erosion of banks along six rivers. At least 9,000 families lost their homes, the Government says.\nAfter record-breaking floods last September, in which three of the world's mightiest rivers inundated two-thirds of Bangladesh and left more than 2,000 people dead and millions homeless, four major flood prevention studies were begun.\nIn the last few weeks, all four reports - by the United States, France, Japan and the United Nations Development Program - were completed and turned over to the Government of President H. M. Ershad, diplomats and officials of international agencies said in interviews. Consideration at Summit\nSome proposals are so sweeping as to envisage a multibillion-dollar rebuilding of Bangladesh's river embankments, or the construction of huge dikes or polders to keep away both the rivers and the unpredictable sea.\nThe reports will now be discussed in international forums, including the group of seven leading industrialized nations at a summit meeting in Paris in mid-July.\nAt about the same time, the World Bank will convene a meeting in Washington of scientific experts and officials from donor nations, Francis van Gigch, chief of the World Bank's Bangladesh office, said in an interview.\nWhile Bangladesh waits for international action, the Government has been building embankments around low-lying areas of Dhaka to protect the capital and its airport. Last September, the airport was closed for nearly a week during the flood, delaying the arrival of relief supplies. A Fatal Convergence\nDiplomats and Bangladeshi officials say that last year's flood, caused by a fatal convergence of rising water in all three major river systems, the Brahmaputra, Ganges and Meghna, dealt a heavy blow to an already fragile development process.\nBangladesh, one of the world's poorest and most densely populated nations, suffered millions of dollars in losses to buildings, roads and other essential structures. Untold numbers of farm animals were lost.\nThe findings of the four studies are in agreement on several points, but differ in recommending courses of action. All agree, for example, that projects must be confined to Bangladesh, not the larger region.\nNations in South Asia say it is unrealistic to expect that India, which controls substantial river water, can be brought into a regional discussion. New Delhi has said repeatedly that it will discuss the issue only on a one-to-one basis with its neighbors.\nIn the case of Bangladesh, this has led to a stalemate over an Indian proposal to build a huge canal across Bangladeshi territory to link the Brahmaputra and Ganges Rivers. But the reports on the whole say that better coordination in issuing flood warnings should be possible. Disagreement on Embankments\nAll reports agree that some annual flooding is not only inevitable but beneficial to the agricultural lands of Bangladesh that feed 110 million people. They say that the damages of these ''normal'' floods could be minimized by better warning systems and emergency services inside the country.\nWhere the reports diverge, and enter into political territory, is on the question of embankments.\nThe United Nations Development Program and the French studies advocate the building of more and higher banks along the rivers, a course favored by President Ershad.\nThe American study - prepared for the United States Agency for International Development by the Irrigation Support Project for Asia and the Near East - questions the value of embankments designed for worst-case floods.\nIt puts emphasis on more effective utilization of ground water in dry seasons, lowering the aquifers by pumping through tube wells, and on drainage during rainy periods."}, {"text": "Slow Bangladesh Growth\n1989-03-03T05:00:00.000Z\nBangladesh will be even poorer next year as economic growth slows because of flooding and a trade imbalance, the World Bank reported this week. It said the economy would grow only 1.2 percent in the fiscal year that began last July 1."}, {"text": "High Cost of Deteriorating Environment Is Charted\n1989-02-12T05:00:00.000Z\nThe world can expect widespread economic decline and social disruption in the 1990's unless national leaders make a serious commitment to reverse the deterioration of the earth's environmental systems, a Washington-based research group said today.\nThe group, the Worldwatch Institute, said the major natural catastrophes of 1988 - further depletion of the ozone layer, the North American drought and the disastrous flooding in Bangladesh - provided a worrisome glimpse of a future in which environmental changes go unchecked. ''Unless the threats of climate change, ozone depletion, soil erosion, deforestation, and population growth are brought under control soon, economic decline may be inevitable,'' said Lester R. Brown, president of the institute and director of the study.\nThe report, ''State of the World 1989,'' recommends strategies for nations to reverse the most threatening trends. It focuses on four key areas: climate protection, reforestation, food production, and reducing population growth in the third world.\n''Time is not on our side,'' Mr. Brown said. ''We have years, not decades, to turn the situation around, and even then there is no guarantee that we will be able to reverse the trends that are undermining the human prospect, but if we do, it will be during the 90's. Beyond that it will be too late.''\nThe report recommended that national energy policies be directed to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels, the principal cause of the so-called greenhouse effect, or global warming. The burning of coal and other fuels such as oil and natural gas releases carbon dioxide that traps heat in the lower atmosphere, allowing temperatures to rise.\nMoreover, the large-scale clearing of tropical forests adds carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, hastening the greenhouse effect. ''If energy policymaking continues to be the domain of short-term thinking and narrow political considerations, there can be little hope,'' Mr. Brown said. The report suggested establishing international efficiency standards for automobiles, lighting systems, and electrical appliances. The report said that the world's 400 million cars currently average 20 miles per gallon of gasoline, emitting 547 million tons of carbon into the atmosphere each year. ''Setting a fuel standard for new cars of 50 miles per gallon by the year 2000 would be an important step toward climate stability,'' the report said.\nThe destruction of forests in many countries has caused several disasters, the report said. The dependency of millions on firewood for fuel has increased rainfall runoff and triggered widespread flooding in Bangladesh, India, the Sudan, Thailand and elsewhere. It has also speeded the extinction of plant and animal species.\nAs forests are cleared and burned, carbon is released into the atmosphere, speeding up the warming.\nThe report also found that the world's food production had dropped 14 percent per capita since 1984, and is now at the level of 1970. It named the North American drought, soil erosion, encroachment of desert in Africa, and scarce land and water as the main reasons for the slower growth.\nCopies of the report may be obtained from Worldwatch Institute, 1776 Massachusetts Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036.

Mr. Bush, who will have just visited Poland and Hungary, will press the leaders to make a strong statement supporting the moves toward democracy in those countries.\nOfficials planning the three-day talks say Mr. Bush, who today announced a six-part program of American aid to Poland, will call on his partners to provide more aid to Poland. But there is already some dispute among the meeting nations about how much of the aid should come from deficit-ridden Washington and how much from Eastern Europe's neighbors in Western Europe. The Group of Seven nations that will be meeting in Paris - the United States, France, Britain, West Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan - are expected to back President Bush's call for debt relief for Poland, including rescheduling its $39 billion in debt. 5,000 Journalists With 5,000 journalists converging on Paris, the summit conference could become, like some of the 14 previous meetings, a klieg-light-filled stage. With the world watching, the leaders seize the occasion to try to carve out the image they want.\nWhile some French politicians and newspapers have accused President Mitterrand of trying to turn the ''bicentennial'' summit meeting into a coronation, Mr. Mitterrand's aides say he his goal for the talks is to carry on the ideals of the French Revolution.\nFor his part, President Bush, some French commentators say, wants to show that he is leader of the West and that Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, has nothing on him in setting the world's agenda.\nWith the rise of the Green movement in many countries, the leaders are also jockeying to show they are friends of the earth. Thus the environment will be high on the agenda, with agreements in sight on protecting the ozone layer and oceans. There is a dispute, however, on the best approach to take on the problem of global warming.\nNonetheless, one senior official working on preparations for the talks said, ''The fact that this will be the first time the environment is looked at fully at a summit shows that this is a turning point.''\nWith the dollar sliding in recent days back into a range that finance ministers find comfortable, several officials said the dollar would not be a big issue. They said the Group of Seven would repeat past statements about the benefits of currency stability, fighting inflation and international economic cooperation. Often a Maverick\nMr. Mitterrand, often an unpredictable maverick at international gatherings, is under intense criticism at home for making the celebration of the French Revolution an event dominated by the rich - or at least the rich nations. Thus, Mr. Mitterrand's aides say, he will use the summit conference itself to show his critics he is the best friend the poor nations have in the industrial world.\nTo make sure the bicentennial celebrations are not an exclusive preserve of the rich nations, the French Government also plans to entertain leaders from two dozen developing nations, including India, Pakistan, Mexico, Brazil, the Philippines, Senegal and Zaire.\nThe visiting leaders from poor and rich nations alike will be treated by the French to dinner at the new Glass Pyramid at the Louvre, the opening of the new Bastille Opera House and good seats for the Bicentennial Parade on the Champs-Elysees on Friday. There will be 30,000 soldiers and police officers for security. Extending Hand to Poor\nThe summit conference itself will extend a hand to poor nations in several ways.\nFirst, the industrial world's leaders will seek to give some impetus to the four-month-old debt plan proposed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. This plan calls for commercial banks to reduce the annual debt service of middle-income countries.\nSeveral officials from several countries said they wanted to continue putting pressure on commercial banks to make concessions to the middle-income debtor nations like Brazil and Mexico. They said it was not yet time for the industrial nations to adopt a more generous debt strategy because that could reduce the pressure on the commercial banks.\nSeveral months ago French officials said they would push for a plan in which the International Monetary Fund would use $10 billion in special drawing rights to guarantee interest payments owed by debtor nations. This would give banks an incentive to forgive some debts or lend new money. Time Is Not Right\nFrench officials now say that the time is not right for a new plan and that the Brady plan should be given a chance to work. However, since President Mitterrand is under such pressure to show he is a friend of the poor, some officials believe he might begin arguing that the Brady plan is inadequate and a new plan is needed.\nIn another measure to help the poor, the seven leaders are expected to agree to pursue a $5 billion, 20-year program to protect Bangladesh against flooding. President Mitterrand is pushing for a program to build embankments and take other flood-prevention measures. In September, more than 2,000 people died in Bangladesh from flooding that left millions homeless.\n''This will prove to the world that we can provide concrete help to people in need,'' one aide said.\nFrance also hopes to win backing for a plan that would combine scientific studies and land-management programs to fight the expansion of the Sahara. Some 20 million acres are lost each year to desert, and the plan aims to help reverse the loss of grazing land.\nOn the issue of global warming, France is seeking an agreement to cut carbon dioxide emissions contingent upon scientific findings that global warming is, in fact, taking place. Many scientists say heat is trapped as carbon dioxide builds up in the atmosphere. Approach Called Hasty\nBut some officials say the French approach is too hasty because so many scientists are not convinced that global warming is occurring. ''The idea of reducing carbon dioxide emissions will hurt because it involves cars, power plants and factories,'' one aide said.\nSeveral officials foresee a compromise in which the leaders call for an international conference on global warming.\n''Environmental protection has to be based on sound science, but we also need to say on sound economics as well,'' one senior British official said.\nSeveral aides said the seven nations would affirm in strong language May's Helsinki agreement, in which 81 nations declared their intent to phase out the use of chlorofluorocarbons by 2000."}, {"text": "33 in Northern Bangladesh Are Reported Killed by Cold\n1989-12-29T05:00:00.000Z\nA cold wave in normally tropical northern Bangladesh has killed at least 33 people in the last week, a newspaper reported today.\nTemperatures in the region have hovered near 42 degrees Fahrenheit since Monday, and the newspaper New Nation said the victims were laborers and other poor people who were unable to protect themselves from the cold.\nAt least 18 people were reported killed in the Kurigram district, 150 miles north of Dhaka, in the last three days, the English-language daily said. Another 15 deaths were reported from the Pabna and Rangpur districts, also in the north.\nSuch low temperatures are rare in Bangladesh, which has a tropical climate for most of the year. Of its 110 million people, most people live in houses with mud floors and walls woven from straw and bamboo, which offer little protection from the cold."}, {"text": "IN THE NATION; Reality at the Summit\n1989-07-14T05:00:00.000Z\nThe earth's capacity to support a rapidly expanding population is declining ominously. So the $2.25 billion Japan is offering the third world for environmental purposes is too little and dangerously near too late.\nNevertheless, Japan's proposal might point the Paris economic summit meeting in the right direction -toward environmental and population dangers that threaten humanity's well-being more certainly than nuclear war.\nThe rest of the more than $40 billion Japan offers in grants and loans to aid economic development, for example, will be largely wasted if current population trends continue. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt made the point succinctly to Alan Riding of The New York Times:\n''We [ Egyptians ] increase by about one million and a half every year. It threatens to choke all our efforts in all fields and quashes all hope of growth, production and development.''\nEgypt's plight is an old but still shocking story in the third world. Mr. Riding detailed it: a 2.7 percent annual population growth rate, a declining death rate, 53 million people now dependent on the 4 percent of Egyptian land that's arable.\nIf Mr. Mubarak's projection is correct, that will be something like 70 million people by the end of this century (only 11 years from now); and the amount of Egyptian land available to produce food will have declined further as an expanding populace absorbs it for dwellings and businesses.\nEgypt's problem, except for its restricted strip of productive land along the Nile, is by no means the world's worst. Over all, the global population - which doubled from 2.5 to 5 billion between 1950 and 1987 - is expected to expand by another billion mouths to be fed by the year 2000.\nIt took more than a century for world population to double from 1.25 billion to 2.5 billion in 1950. So the extraordinary ''momentum of population growth'' achieved in recent decades ''ensures that human numbers cannot start to decline as a result of reduced fertility in less than half a century'' from now. That's the conclusion of ''Global Change and Carrying Capacity,'' a paper by Paul R. Ehrlich and associates of the Stanford University Institute for Population and Resource Studies.\nThe combination of continued population growth and the threatened ''global warming'' - an average worldwide temperature rise of 3 to 4 degrees Centigrade - is viewed in the institute study as drastically increasing the possibility of inadeqate food supplies in coming decades. A decrease in water availability for major grain-growing areas, limiting harvests, is one obvious consequence of changes in climate that are projected to occur more swiftly than ever in recorded history.\nShifting climate belts will require adjustments in irrigation and drainage systems, at a possible cost of $200 billion worldwide. Planting drought-resistant grains will result in reduced yields, in some cases less than half that of the usual yield of corn. Northward migration of favorable temperature/rainfall belts will shift grain production to areas of Canada and the Soviet Union where harvests will be constrained by thin and infertile soils.\nAlready, the world's arable land is declining each year by an area the size of Colorado - forcing those who once tilled it to move into urban slums or to use up other marginal or forested land. This process accelerates with population growth; and deforestation caused by growing numbers of people who cut down trees for fuel or building supplies, or to clear land for farming, in turn causes erosion, drought and higher temperatures.\nThe institute report quotes authorities who believe ''recent catastrophic flooding in Bangladesh can be attributed in part to massive deforestation in the Himalayas, a phenomenon closely tied to population growth.''\nThe current loss of food-producing areas will increase with global warming because of the consequent sea-level rise expected to reach 1.4 to 2.2 meters by the end of the next century. This will flood agricultural land and wetlands that support fisheries (much of the Florida Everglades will be lost), salinize water aquifers, and make large areas vulnerable to storm damage.\nThe food problems resulting from global warming are ''acute,'' the institute paper warns, ''since leaders in the rich nations have largely failed to realize the magnitude of the changes necessary if the warming is to be sufficiently slowed.''\nThose leaders are meeting in Paris. What else do they have to talk about that's half as threatening or immediate?"}, {"text": "Scientists Link '88 Drought to Natural Cycle in Tropical Pacific\n1989-01-03T05:00:00.000Z\nLAST year's killing drought in the United States was caused by massive, naturally occurring climatic forces in the tropical Pacific Ocean and had little to do with global warming caused by the greenhouse effect, according to new evidence.\nThe same complex forces, involving large-scale shifts in ocean temperatures and winds in the equatorial Pacific, affected not only North America. They also made themselves felt on the other side of the world, scientists say, causing the unusually heavy monsoon rains that in 1988 brought record floods, death and misery to Bangladesh.\nThese broad, intricately interconnected relationships between the ocean and the atmosphere have been only dimly understood in the past. But now climatologists are making major strides in understanding the ways in which such relationships in one part of the world drastically affect weather conditions, lives and fortunes in another.\nWhile most climate experts believe that the greenhouse effect, a global warming caused by pollutants in the atmosphere, will have a major impact in the decades ahead, even those who argue most strongly for that point of view agree that last year's drought was overwhelmingly a product of natural forces. Even if a warming trend is already under way, as some experts believe, on a year-to-year basis events such as last year's changes in the Pacific exert a far stronger influence on the weather, scientists say.\nThe tropical Pacific is emerging in some scientists' minds as perhaps the planet's most important source of short-term climatic changes.\nThis is the territory of El Nino, the massive strip of abnormally warm water that from time to time stretches westward along the Equator from South America and that sometimes plays havoc with the weather in various parts of the world. But El Nino is only part of the story.\nClimatologists now recognize that it is not just a random phenomenon. It appears periodically, alternating with what has only recently been identified as its opposite twin: an abnormally cold stretch of equatorial water.\nScientists disagree on what to call the cold cycle. It was first dubbed La Nina, Spanish for ''the girl,'' to distinguish it from El Nino, which means ''the boy,'' or Christ Child, so named because the warm cycle appears near Christmas. Some scientists objected to La Nina as sexist, however, and substituted El Viejo, ''the old man,'' as in Old Man Winter. Still others prefer to avoid all this by simply calling the cycles warm events and cold events.\nIt was this cold cycle in the eastern Pacific, some scientists now say, that played a major role in creating the great North American drought of 1988 and the devastating floods that indundated Bangladesh.\nEl Nino and its opposite are the two poles of a continuous back-and-forth action in which the surface waters around the Equator in the eastern Pacific go from one temperature extreme to another every 3 to 6 years. Scientists have named the grand atmospheric changes that accompany these swings, and that are tightly interwoven with them, the ''southern oscillation,'' and it is an object of intense study. More Disruption Predicted\nThe cold phase that affected last year's climate still persists. And if it continues to dominate that part of the Pacific into this spring (in the Northern Hemisphere), as some forecasters predict, scientists say it could disrupt the worldwide weather picture again. But at this point no one can say exactly what its impact would be.\nStill, the fact that scientists now know as much as they do about these mechanisms is a measure of how far they have come in the last decade in understanding short-term, global climatic change. Improved data collection and more advanced computer models of climatic processes have enabled climatologists to develop at least a rudimentary picture of these processes. Until recently, such a picture hardly existed.\n''What's exciting about it is that three years ago, none of us recognized the cold side of this southern oscillation,'' said Dr. James O'Brien, a meteorologist and oceanographer at Florida State University who this year will head the National Academy of Science's committee on the ocean's role in global climatic change.\nPrecisely what triggers a warm or cold phase is not yet perfectly understood, but scientists believe they know much about the general processes at work. A cold phase, such as now exists, develops when strong trade winds, blowing from the east, drive warm surface water to the western Pacific. At the same time, there is an increased upwelling of cold water from the ocean depths off South America.\nAcross the Pacific, the warm water driven westward by the trade winds literally piles up in the western Pacific. This warm water intensifies rainstorm activity in that region, producing unusually strong monsoon rains in South and Southeast Asia. This is a major reason why Bangladesh suffered so in 1988. 'Spring Is Transition Time'\nAt such a time, skies are relatively clear on the other side of the Pacific, near South America, and the sun begins re-heating the water there. The cycle starts to reverse. The reverse trend accelerates when trade winds are at their weakest, usually in the spring. ''Spring is transition time,'' says Mark A. Cane of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory. ''You have the sense that nature rolls its dice in April every year and once it does, the pattern is set for the next year.''\nAs the trade winds weaken, warm water from the western Pacific flows back toward the east, and with it, an area of atmospheric instability that generates thunderstorms and rain. This weakens the trade winds further, and the warm water reaches all the way back to South America.\nAt the same time, less cold water wells up from the ocean depths. The result of all this is an El Nino. The most severe El Nino of the 1980's, in 1982-83, brought heavy rains and flooding to the west coast of South America and severe drought to Australia and the Philippines.\nOn average, each warm and cold phase takes about two years to develop and play out, though some are longer or shorter. Each warm and cold phase also has its own profile -some are major and some are minor. The latest El Nino in 1986-87, for example, was mild, producing sea-surface temperatures of 4 degrees Fahrenheit above average; by contrast, the disastrous 1982-83 event was about 7 degress above average.\nThe present phase represents ''an unusually cold side of the coin,'' says Dr. Kevin Trenberth, who heads the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. Sea-surface temperatures along the Equator dropped 10 degrees from their 1986-87 El Nino high, to about 6 degrees below average. A more usual ''cold event'' brings temperatures of about 3 degrees below average. History of a Drought\nEnter the 1988 United States drought. According to a study by Dr. Trenberth and colleagues that appeared in a recent issue of the journal Science, it happened this way:\nThe cold water along the Equator caused a zone of unstable air just to the north, called the intertropical convergence zone, to move farther north. The convergence zone, where trade winds from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres collide, is a major area in which thunderstorms and rain develop. It tends to occupy the warmest water in the region.\nThis year, for unexplained reasons, a large, abnormally warm patch of water developed southeast of Hawaii, in effect pulling the convergence zone northward even as the cold water along the Equator pushed it. Eventually, the convergence zone overlapped somewhat with the warm patch to the north. The result was thunderstorm activity in an area where it normally does not occur.\nThis area impinged on the southern edge of the eastward-flowing river of air that includes the North American jet stream, which carries the low-pressure areas that bring spring and summer rain to America.\nIn this case, the intense thunderstorm activity disturbed the westerlies, like a rock in the middle of a stream, setting up ripples and swirls in the atmosphere. These developed into high- and low-pressure systems that moved the jet stream far to the north. This made way for a large, rainless high-pressure system, which moved into the gap from the south. It dominated the Midwest for weeks, bringing on the drought.\nOnce the drought began, Dr. Trenberth said, it fed on itself as evaporation at the Earth's surface decreased and surface temperatures thereby increased, ''so that even if a cloud wanted to form, it doesn't have enough moisture to produce rain.'' 'We Don't Understand'\nFor now, other climatologists are treating the Trenberth theory on the drought as they do any new scientific report: as something that must be subjected to further testing. ''It's a sound, useful idea, but it would be stretching it to take it as conclusive at this point,'' said Dr. Cane of Lamont-Doherty. There are probably a number of contributing factors to the drought that have not been identified, he said, adding: ''I don't think we have an understanding of how these droughts come about and why they persist. Which is not to say that we don't understand anything.'' Models of Forecasting\nDr. Cane and colleagues have developed the most ambitious of a number of models that predict the fluctuations of warm and cold cycles in the tropical Pacific. Based on the latest data, for November, Dr. Cane said that the present cold phase should ''bottom out'' about now and that it should start to ease in the summer.\nA forecast by Dr. O'Brien's group at Florida State, also based on November data, says that the cold phase will last another three or four months. ''That's about as far in the future as we tend to look at those things.''\nA third forecast by a group led by Dr. Tim Barnett at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at La Jolla, Calif., calls for the cold phase to persist into spring. ''We're looking for next summer and fall to be more or less normal,'' he said. After that, if scientists are right about the new pattern, another swing toward El Nino, the warm phase, should begin.\nDr. Trenberth said that while global warming from the greenhouse effect may have made the 1988 drought worse, it ''almost certainly'' was not the fundamental cause. Over a long span of time, he said, global warming might make droughts more likely in some parts of the world, and worse wherever they occur. But year-to-year variations in climate are affected more powerfully by ''natural'' climatic forces he said, pointing out that the short-term temperature swings in the southern oscillation are far larger than the short-term differences produced by global warming.\nDr. James E. Hansen of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, whose testimony on the greenhouse effect at the height of the 1988 drought focused attention on the problem, said in an interview that he agreed with this analysis. Dr. Hansen, on the basis of a mathematical model, holds that as the greenhouse effect gets stronger, the frequency of drought will increase significantly. But this change will not start to be noticed until the 1990's, he said.\nSome scientists believe that the warm and cold swings in the eastern Pacific, because they cover such vast stretches, have more effect on global atmospheric temperatures than the greenhouse effect. One, Dr. O'Brien, is predicting that the present cold phase will bring about a sharp drop in average global temperatures, reducing them to 1950's levels and slowing down planetary warming by 30 to 35 years. Others, while conceding the effect, say that estimate is too high.\nWhat long-term effect the greenhouse effect may have, in turn, on El Nino and its sibling is a matter for speculation at this point, one of a many unanswered questions that still challenge climatologists. Global Weather Connections New findings link last year's drought in the United States and floods in Asia to periodic shifts in winds and ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific. THE SOURCE: According to the theory, the drought originated with unusually cold water along the Equator (1), which pushed the intertropical convergence zone (2), where trade winds collide, farther north than usual. Abnormally warm water southeast of Hawaii also pulled the zone northward. The zone overlapped the warm patch (3), resulting in unusual thunderstorm activity (4). The storms disturbed the atmosphere, (5) setting up ripples and swirls that became high- and low-pressure systems. These pushed the jet stream far north (6), making way for a large, rainless high-pressure system (7), which brought weeks of drought."}, {"text": "Summit Debate: How to Help the Poorer Nations\n1989-07-15T05:00:00.000Z\nTo the presumed pleasure of the French host and the palpable discomfort of the Americans here, the conference of the seven mightiest democracies has opened with a political and philosophical struggle over helping the world's poorer countries.\nBy asking the presidents and prime ministers of poor nations - invited here to help mark the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution - to share the tables and reviewing stands with the leaders who are staying on for the seven-nation economic summit conference, President Francois Mitterrand has revived the North-South conflict of the 1960's and 70's.\nIt aligns those who would help the poor mostly in discussions behind the scenes against those, like Mr. Mitterrand and some of the prominent leaders of poorer nations, who see more to be gained in the glare of public debate at conferences monitored by the world press.\nTwo nations have become the vehicles of Mr. Mitterrand's special cause. Mexico, with its $100 billion of debt to foreign creditors, has become the symbol of the strategy of the rich, defined primarily by the Bush Administration, to help such countries reduce their debts and strengthen their economies. Bangladesh is a symbol of the poorest of the poor, a country that needs money from the rich to tame the rivers that overflow and wipe out whole villages, as they did in September. Bush Continues Policy\nEarly in this decade, conservative leaders - President Reagan, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany - confined these issues to the private deliberations of the multinational lending agencies in Washington that they control, primarily the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and to subsidiary agencies of the United Nations. And it is there that the Bush Administration would leave them.\nAsked about the call here Thursday by several of the poorer nations for a conference of the rich and the poor, the President's chief of staff, John H. Sununu, said today, ''The tendency would be not to move in that direction at this time.'' Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said, ''You don't get solutions to problems by bunching up areas and calling them North and South.''\nMost of the other industrial nations view the issue as the Americans do.\nA previous French President, the conservative Charles de Gaulle, would rattle his allies the same way, exerting influence that exceeded the relative position of France in world affairs. The resemblance of Mr. Mitterrand, however Socialist his orientation, to his predecessor was striking today as he greeted his guests and reviewed the parades. He stood ramrod straight, his eyes cast some miles ahead, barely bending in greeting, smiling while brooding.\nBy inviting leaders of the developing world here, he has forced attention on the American debt plan, Treasury Secretary Brady's approach to helping the countries reduce their debts. Since it was announced four months ago, not a single agreement had been reached between banks and debtors, inviting questions here of its utility and proposals from the poorer nations for a conference of debtors and creditors. Pressure on Mexican Banks\nFor that reason, the Bush team here has been exerting great pressure on Mexico's banks to get a deal sewn up. At the same time, Mr. Brady on Thursday and then the President today met privately with the President of Mexico, Carlos Salinas de Gortari.\nWhen Mr. Salinas emerged from his discussion with Mr. Bush, he was asked how close he was to an agreement. He held up a hand, with his thumb and index finger an inch apart.\nConcerned that Mr. Brady might not win a symbolic debt accord here, officials have begun emphasizing the importance of the content of the agreement over artificial deadlines. Reminded that the Administration has said it wanted a Mexican accord quickly, Mr. Sununu said today, ''Well, the only distinction I would make is that 'quickly' could mean by Sunday or 'quickly' could mean sometime next week, or sometime next month.'' He was the first official to pedal as far back as a month.\nBut the Administration has left little doubt that it will go to some lengths to get the agreement by Sunday, when the conference ends. On Thursday, officials reported, and Mr. Brady and Mr. Sununu today confirmed, that they were preparing a temporary ''bridge'' loan of $1 billion to $2 billion for Mexico once an agreement is reached with the banks. 'Mexico Is the Key'\n''Mexico is the key to deblock the Brady initiative,'' a senior official of the European Community said here. He said that without a creedible agreement, some Western nations would encourage Mr. Mitterrand to reintroduce a plan of his own that in deference to the Americans he has kept off the summit agenda. It requires new contributions for debt relief to the I.M.F., which adds up to a call on taxpayer funds of the developed countries.\nOf greater personal interest to Mr. Mitterrand, however, is Bangladesh. He proposes that the summit nations join in spending around $6 billion for dikes to contain the country's flood-prone rivers.\nAmerican and West German officials here said that however noble the proposal, it was not only expensive but probably environmentally foolhardy. In building up dikes along river banks, France would alter the alluvial plains that sustain agriculture in Bangladesh.\nThese officials said that for the present at least they expected to be able to reduce the proposal to something more modest. Rather than commit to spending any money, they said, the summit nations would ask that the World Bank prepare a technical study, an approach they have often used in the past to placate French presidents."}, {"text": "Nepal's Economy Is Gasping as India, a Huge Neighbor, Squeezes It Hard\n1989-04-11T05:00:00.000Z\nA dispute with India is forcing Nepal, one of the world's poorest and least accessible countries, to fight for its economic survival, a fight that is also testing its political stability.\nNew Delhi cut most of the landlocked kingdom's vital trade links to the outside world more than two weeks ago, and Nepal was shaken by student demonstrations on April 3 and 4. The protests became as anti-Government as they were anti-Indian. Universities in the Katmandu area were closed amid conflicting reports of casualties as the police suppressed the riots.\nLines at gas stations are long, straining tempers. The streets of Katmandu, the capital, are nearly devoid of cars, and travel around Nepal by air or bus is becoming more difficult. Forests are being stripped for cooking fuel.\nIn an interview Sunday, Nepal's Foreign Minister, Shailendra Kumar Upadhyaya, said Katmandu wanted to end its special relationship with India, which had become one of economic dependence.\n''It is in our interest to let interdependence grow,'' he said of ties with India. ''It is in our interest to see that our dependence on one country does not grow.'' Border Crossings Closed\nNepal, wedged between China and India, the world's two most populous nations, has only one reliable outlet to the sea, overland through the Indian port of Calcutta, more than 700 miles away.\nOn March 23, after a dispute over how to renegotiate lapsed trade and transit treaties, New Delhi suddenly closed 19 of 21 border crossings with this Himalayan nation, severing links not only to the port but also to northern Indian cities.\nThe Indians want a single pact. The Nepalese want two, as they have had since 1978, to separate their important transit rights from trade and commercial ties to India. The two accords were a concession made by a previous Government in New Delhi under Prime Minister Moraji Desai.\nForeign Minister Upadhyaya said Nepal had in the last few days proposed a new trade treaty that would include no special concessions but only most-favored-nation status, putting economic relations with New Delhi on a more equal footing. Indian officials have not responded.\nAt the end of March, two more agreements expired, covering Nepal's imports of petroleum products and coal through India. Almost immediately, there was a sharp drop in supplies of kerosene for cooking and gasoline for the buses and trucks that link remote villages to sources of food, medicine and other necessities. Trees Cut for Fuel\nRationing of petroleum products has been introduced. Prices of other commodities like sugar, salt and processed foods, many imported from India, have risen.\nEven protected trees have been cut to meet fuel shortages. Trucks arrive daily, bringing precious logs to be burned in cooking fires.\nChirin S. Thapa, a principal adviser to King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev, called the damage to forests ''an unfortunate part of this emergency.'' He said the emergency measures could endanger the survival of Nepal's 18 million people.\nDeforestation in Nepal, apart from eroding local hillsides, is contributing to flooding in India and Bangladesh as swollen Himalayan rivers rush down to the plains.\nInterviews with Nepalese and Indian officials here and in New Delhi, Nepalese businessmen and journalists, and Western diplomats in Katmandu reveal a complex interaction of causes and perceptions that led to what the Nepalese say was a completely unexpected blockade by India. Links With China a Factor\nIt is almost universally believed in Katmandu that the trade dispute was only a pretext for New Delhi to vent its displeasure with Nepal for an accumulation of grievances. Growing Nepalese-Chinese cooperation, culminating in Katmandu's purchase in August 1988 of Chinese antiaircraft guns, is a major factor.\nThe presence of Chinese contractors working on World Bank or Government aid projects in Nepal, especially near the border with India, has led to protests, Nepalese officials say.\nMany Chinese consumer goods are on sale in Nepalese bazaars. Some, like small appliances and crockery, have displaced Indian products, although Nepalese officials say the trade gap with India continues to widen.\nIn addition, the fast-developing Nepalese tourist industry - a vital hard-currency earner - has in recent years ceased to be an appendage of Indian tourism. With direct air links to Europe, Southeast Asia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burma and Hong Kong, Nepal is bypassing Indian travel agents, airports and airlines.\nPersonal relations between King Birendra and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi are reported to be frosty. The 43-year-old King, who inherited the throne from King Mahendra in 1972, saw India annex the neighboring kingdom of Sikkim in 1974, and later, in Nepal's view, reduce the King of Bhutan to an Indian vassal. A Martial Tradition\nDiplomats say that the royal family, which dominates a party-less Government, is sensitive to the fate of Sikkim and Bhutan and concerned about Katmandu's independence. Nepal is the oldest nation in South Asia, with its own architecture, language and distinctive forms of Hinduism and Buddhism.\n''They are proud of their martial tradition,'' a diplomat said. ''Beneath this placid, gentle exterior, there is a determination there.''\nIndian officials, who acknowledge their annoyance with Katmandu's Chinese arms purchases, say they are also perplexed by what they see as a new and inexplicably uncompromising attitude in Nepal, which has benefited from nearly 40 years of Indian aid and special trade concessions and an open- door policy for millions of Nepalese job seekers.\nIndians say Nepal, apart from resisting a combined trade and transit treaty, refuses to reverse decisions that New Delhi regards as violations of a 1950 treaty of friendship between the two capitals that has been the base of their relations ever since. These violations include the levying of tariffs on Indian goods and the introduction of work permits for Indian nationals in Nepal. Nepalese in India are not required to have them.\nA new trade treaty, initialed by Nepal and India last November, was rejected by New Delhi when the Nepalese would not withdraw tariffs, an Indian official said. Government Is Criticized\nIf the economic crisis in Nepal is prolonged, the King and his Government will have to rely on the willingness of the Nepalese to stand behind their decision to defy New Delhi, and to make adjustments to lives that are already borderline for many.\nMost Nepalese interviewed said they were strongly opposed to the large Indian presence in Nepal and to any attempts by New Delhi to dictate this country's policies.\nBut they were also critical of the Government, which they said has failed to develop the country or allow people effective democratic rights. Nepalese are limited to voting in party- less elections for local councils. Open criticism of the monarchy and the Government is rarely tolerated."}, {"text": "Nations Call for Action on Environment\n1989-07-16T05:00:00.000Z\nThe latest draft of the economic communique being worked out by the major industrial democracies known as the Group of Seven calls for ''decisive action'' to protect the global environment.\nThe document, described as all but final, notes ''with great concern the growing pollution of air, lakes, rivers, oceans and seas.''\nThe seven nations - the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada - have thus given the environment, an afterthought at previous summit meetings, a place at the top of their agenda for the world economy.\nThe meeting's ''economic declaration'' is to be published Sunday. Today's draft is considered complete except for a few finishing touches, described as minor, being worked out in discussions of finance ministers. Members of delegations confirmed various passages of the document but said changes in nuance were still possible. Nine Pages of Concern\nThe environment takes up nine pages of the 24-page, double-spaced document - far more than any other subject.\n''This is an idea whose time has come,'' a senior Bush Administration official said. ''When an idea comes in politics, it comes with a bang.''\nThe declarations at these annual gatherings of chiefs of state are more often statements of desire and determination than commitments to change policies. But they often lead to, or reinforce, changes in the countries' domestic economic policies.\nThe draft makes no explicit comment on the level of the dollar, usually a sensitive topic for meetings of the Group of Seven ministers. West German and Japanese officials said they did not intend to mention the currency, and the Americans had no wish to.\nInstead, the statement said the countries agreed to pursue, ''in a mutually reinforcing way,'' established policies that are aimed at keeping the dollar stable. In the ministers' most recent comment on the dollar, at a meeting in April, they said they wanted no further rise nor an excessive decline.\nAfter continuing to rise in May and June despite the ministers' wishes, the dollar has receded to the April levels, so the absence of comment implies that the April statement remains in effect.\nThe countries also give an unequivocal endorsement of the Bush Administration strategy for dealing with third world debt. That strategy involves banks and debtors working to reduce the debt burden with a minimum of taxpayer involvement. The draft flatly rejects approaches that would require infusions of more taxpayer money, a tack favored by the host of the summit meeting, President Francois Mitterrand of France. A Statement on Bangladesh\nBut in a concession to Mr. Mitterrand, the countries single out one impoverished country, Bangladesh, to receive help in controlling floods that last September wiped out whole villages, although they did not go so far as to propose any spending for the ambitious system of dikes that Mr. Mitterrand wants.\nOne developing country, Mexico, has weighed heavily on the deliberations here because it is seen as a test of the debt policy of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. The Administration has been hoping that a debt-reduction agreement between Mexico and its foreign bankers, in effect validating the Brady policy, will be reached in New York before the meetings here end.\nSo far no such agreements have been made with any debtor, and it is possible that none will be reached with Mexico.\n''I think we're very close,'' Mr. Brady said in an interview with a few reporters today. Mr. Brady, former chairman of the Dillon, Read investment banking firm, added: ''I've been doing deals for 35 years, and you can't tell exactly when a deal is going to close. But I think we're very close.'' Resolve on Drug Traffic\nAmerican officials said they were pleased with one result of their meetings, a strengthened commitment to stop world production of and traffic in illegal drugs.\nAmong other things, the draft says the Group of Seven will convene experts to ''consider means to prevent the utilization of the banking system and financial institutions for the purpose of money laundering.'' France would call the first meeting.\nCurtailing money laundering, the process by which drug traffickers disguise the origins of their money as it moves through the world banking system, ''is a very important way to attack the drug problem,'' the senior Administration official said. Optimism on World Inflation\nWith respect to economic performance, the summit countries note that inflation has been contained in many of the countries but requires vigilance where it is still rising.\nIn interviews, however, officials of several countries said that they were even more sanguine about inflation than the draft statement implies and that they were moving toward Mr. Brady's position that the worst of inflation is past and interest rates could start falling.\nThe West German Finance Minister, Theodor Waigel, said he expected inflation at home to fall to 2.5 percent next year from 3 percent now.\nThe United States incurred implicit criticism in the meetings, the statement shows, over its decision in April to single out Japan, Brazil and India for possible trade sanctions for domestic policies that obstruct American access to their markets. Other countries have called the step a violation of multilateral cooperation in resolving trade disputes.\nThe statement says the countries will ''avoid any discriminatory or autonomous actions'' (an implied criticism of countries that protect their markets), but it adds, ''We also are pledged to oppose the tendency toward unilateralism, bilateralism, sectoralism.'' Call for Environmental Research\nOn the environment, the countries called for more research on issues but added that ''the persisting uncertainty on some of these issues should not unduly delay our action.''\nSignificantly, the countries went beyond the multinational Helsinki accord of earlier this year. That agreement called for an end to production of chlorofluorocarbons, used in refrigerators and air-conditioners, which contribute to the depletion of the world's protective ozone layer.\nThe statement says attention should also be given to other substances that deplete the ozone layer, presumably including carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform.\nThe countries also support further use of nuclear power in energy production as an alternative to burning fossil fuels, which are thought to contribute to global warming.\nThey raise the possibility of establishing a ''framework'' or ''umbrella convention'' to set out guidelines for combatting climate change. The statement is a gesture toward establishing an international body to regulate the world environment.\nThe countries also accepted an Italian Government proposal to serve as the host of a forum on international law for the environment."}, {"text": "Land Is Losing to the Poor's Fight for Short-Term Survival\n1989-11-28T05:00:00.000Z\nACTING out of desperation, many of the poorest people in the world are cutting down forests, razing grasslands and slowly destroying fragile ecosystems to survive, environmental researchers say.\nPoor farmers in the Sudan clear trees at the headwaters of the Nile, and by destroying these valuable watersheds, cause floods up and down the river. Peasants in Brazil with no fields of their own hew down the Amazon rain forests and indirectly threaten the climate of the globe by reducing the production of oxygen.\n''For centuries, there has been moral outrage about disparities in standards of living,'' said Alan Durning, a staff member of the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental research organization. ''Today we find poverty is not just a moral issue, because we now have a situation where poor people endanger the well-being of the better-off.'' 'Landless People'\nThe poor in Costa Rica have dealt a heavy blow to the rain forests that once covered most of their country, said Sheldon Annis, a member of the Overseas Development Council, an organization that researches economic issues affecting developing countries.\nIn Costa Rica, as in most of Latin America, there are two types of poor, Mr. Annis said. Those in the first group have a small parcel of land or some community that helps sustain them. Though these people must fight daily for their food and livelihood, they are finding a political voice, he said. But those in the second category live in despair, he said. ''These are landless people, children, deculturated tribal people,'' he said. ''They are people whose lands have already been developed throughout the world. They are the ones who are moving up the sides of hills.''\nExcess in affluent communities drives most of the world's environmental problems, Mr. Durning said, but as the numbers of the impoverished have grown by more than 200 million people worldwide in the last decade, so has the detriment of starvation and homelessness to the environment.\nTo subsist, the poor must consume or shatter the very resources that give them life, he said. Mr. Durning is the author of a recent report ''Poverty and the Environment: Reversing the Downward Spiral.'' U.N. Efforts\nThe relationship between poverty and environment has been apparent to development workers at the United Nations for some time, said Paul Perry, director of the U.N.'s Development Program in Washington.\nFrom 1976 to 1986, the budget for such projects as developing underground water reserves in Mali, cleaning up the Ganges in Bangladesh and expanding small farms in Zambia has nearly tripled, from $42.5 million to $123 million.\n''We're not letting it drop,'' Mr. Perry said. But he added, ''There's a need for more concerted effort.''\nPeople in some countries have begun their own efforts to reverse the environmental damage, said Keith Oberg, a field representative for the Inter-American Foundation. The foundation is a Government agency that gives financial assistance to small development operations in the Caribbean and Latin America.\nRecently, it gave more than $40,000 to farmers in Costa Rica who are trying to turn back the erosion of their land by reforestation. The farmers themselves came up with the idea of reforestation, Mr. Oberg said, and the foundation provided money to pay for seeds, salaries, tools and vehicle costs.\n''I happen to believe there is some hope,'' Mr. Oberg said. ''In Costa Rica, we find a lot of people who are discovering they're shooting themselves in the foot.''\nBut Mr. Annis said: ''All this stuff about grass roots development is overstated. It's wishful thinking. Credit programs and education programs don't work unless states are basically competent and do what they're supposed to do.'' Economic Measures\nFinancial institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have to change their policies, Mr. Durning said. As the bank works with developing nations on ways for them to pay off their huge debts, he said, it should make sure that they do not try to come up with the money by cutting food subsidies indiscriminately or by taking money away from education and health care while leaving the military and other power structures intact.\nThe World Bank focuses on helping everyone in the developing world by giving blanket assistance to national economies, he said, but it needs to shift emphasis to helping the poorest people in those nations.\nBecause of its size and the size of its loans, the bank is not always able to reach the poorest of the poor, a staff member at the World Bank said.\nBut the bank has begun to look at ways to reduce poverty along lines suggested in Mr. Durning's report. The staff is discussing devoting more money to projects that will provide jobs for more people.\nThough Mr. Durning says much needs to be done, he is optimistic. ''It's extraordinary how things can change suddenly,'' Mr. Durning said. ''Look at Eastern Europe. Who could have predicted that? If we can make the case to people not only through humanitarian arguments but also with the threat to the environment that these problems have to be solved, then we may move in that direction much quicker.''"}, {"text": "With Iraqi Troops at the Truce Line: Where Legions Died, Deathly Quiet\n1989-04-04T05:00:00.000Z\nTwo United Nations officers stood in silence in the Iraqi observation post, peering through binoculars at Iranian positions across a no man's land and a waterway.\nThree red, white and black Iranian flags strained in the breeze above a mountain of sandbags. The two officers, part of the 350-member force monitoring the cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war, scanned the ground 500 yards away on the further shore.\nThey looked out beyond the remnants of a bridge crossing the Shatt al Arab waterway, which makes up southernmost stretch of the boundary between the two nations.\nThe only movement on the opposite banks came from the flags whipping in the warm wind. ''They are all asleep,'' the Iraqi officer said. ''Nothing is going on. Drink your tea peacefully.'' Agatha Christie's Haunt\nFor eight months, about 70 officers from 13 countries have been monitoring the cease-fire from their headquarters in the decaying Shatt al Arab Hotel. The hotel is in Basra, where Agatha Christie once wrote murder mysteries while her archeologist husband excavated nearby.\nThe Iraqis' Southern Bridge post is a forward observation station on the edge of the Shatt al Arab, on the outskirts of Fao, on the gulf. Established before the truce took effect last Aug. 20, the post is a concrete pillbox covered in sandbags with a terrace protected by a crenelated sandbag wall, like a medieval castle.\nAhead, rusty iron pylons sticking from the muddy water mark all that remains of the bridge that Iran built when it captured the Fao Peninsula in February 1986. The rusting hulk of a cargo ship sits 100 yards upstream. Tea on 'Chai Bridge'\n''We call it 'Chai Bridge,' because when the United Nations officers come, we always give them chai,'' the Iraqi officer said, using the word that means tea in the Middle East. He was speaking to the United Nations officers and to the first Western reporter to visit the Iraqi side of the cease-fire line since the truce was declared. As he spoke, the sweet, mint-flavored tea was served by a young soldier wearing a helmet several sizes too big. He carried a battered aluminum tray.\nThe officer told of how the Iraqi Army destroyed the bridge before retaking Fao last April. It was the first of a series of victories that led Iran to agree to peace, leading to the truce in the eight-year war.\n''They couldn't run away,'' he said of the Iranians. ''So they surrendered or jumped into the water.''\nIts business done, the United Nations team prepared to leave the post. A convoy of white vehicles bearing United Nations insignia drove slowly back across 300 yards of no man's land to the immense earth wall that the Iraqis have built along the Shatt al Arab. It marks the cease-fire line on this section of the front. A Rust-Choked Waterway\nThe Southern Bridge post is legitimately in Iraqi hands because it was established before the truce took effect. But under the truce, the strip of land running from the earth wall to the river bank, as well as the Shatt al Arab itself, is a no man's land. Only the United Nations observers may enter there.\nIn 1980, when the war started, President Saddam Hussein said one of his goals was to re-establish Iraqi sovereignty over the entire Shatt al Arab, which is now shared by the two nations. For at least 500 years the two countries have been fighting over the waterway, which is now clogged with sunken ships, silt and unexploded munitions.\nBy day and night, the United Nations soldiers, working in two-man teams, patrol 250 miles of the Iraqi Army's forward positions. ''Always of different nationalities,'' said Col. Ousman Goudiaby, a Senegalese who is second in command in the southern sector. ''It makes us more objective.''\nUnder the truce, the Iranian and Iraqi armies are supposed to maintain the forward positions they held on the day the cease-fire was delcared. No new trenches, no new gun placements, no new fortifications and no more firing.\nPeace talks have been under way since the truce was declared, but progress is slow. Iraq still controls some parcels of Iranian territory, and the two countries hold 100,000 war prisoners. A round of talks scheduled for late March was postponed, and Iraqi officials say they do not expect the two sides to meet before the end of April. Observers With Tied Hands\nSo every day, the observers on this side of the front inspect the Iraqi positions and note complaints about violations. On the other side, another United Nations team patrols Iran's defenses.\n''But all we can do is ask the local commander to correct a violation, and if he doesn't do so, report it to higher authority,'' Colonel Goudiaby said.\nUnited Nations and Iraqi officers say the cease-fire has become a way of life in the Fao area, with few violations reported by either side. But further north, just north of Basra, it is a different story, with the Iranian Army deliberately flooding a section of no man's land to force Iraq to abandon forward positions on Iranian territory.\nThe flooding has provoked artillery duels as the Iraqis try to knock out the pumps and the Iranians fire back. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar of the United Nations has called the flooding a ''serious violation'' of the cease-fire. The United Nations observers consider the big earth dams that the Iraqi Army is building to keep out the water no more than a technical cease-fire violation. 'The Cease-Fire Is Solid'\nThe Iraqi Army was cooperative as the observers inspected several miles of the earth wall. Military policemen in red berets and white belts snapped to attention and saluted as the convoy passed through check points. Soldiers on guard duty presented arms. Bayonets flashed in the sun.\nIraq's defensive wall is 15 to 20 feet high, with a cement-lined trench cut into the top where armed soldiers stand guard. The guards sleep in dugouts in the base of the wall. Every 100 yards or so is a heavy-gun emplacement.\nAs the United Nations team drove past, its members noticed an a few recoilless rifles mounted in emplacements, usually under a tarpaulin. But most of the time the emplacements were empty. ''The atmosphere is relaxed,'' said Maj. Huq Belal, a Bangladeshi operations officer. ''The cease-fire is solid.''\nAfter inspecting Southern Bridge, the United Nations team struck back inland across the devastated moonscape left by the Fao fighting. In the once-busy oil port of Fao itself, only the mosque stands. The Ziggurats of Babylon\nThe rest of the town is rubble. Scarcely a brick remains on a brick. The oil terminal is a jungle of twisted steel. Where the refinery once stood, the oil tanks have been crushed like empty soft drink cans.\nFrom time to time, the radio crackled to life inside the air-conditioned United Nations vehicles. An Iraqi unit that found Iranian bodies further north asked for help in returning them to Iran.\nA message went through to the United Nations headquarters on the Iranian side. Once both sides agree, a truck flying the United Nations flag will arrive to remove the remains.\nOutside Fao, the flat, marshy land appears empty of civilians. Villages are deserted ruins. Every mile or so, clusters of man-made hills stand topped with antiaircraft guns, reminiscent of the ziggurats built by the kings of Babylon. Forlorn Groves of Dates\nThe groves of date palms, once among the finest in the Middle East, have become a swampy jumble of blackened stumps, spent shell cases and rusting tank tracks. Telegraph poles lean drunkenly across the road, shot through with bullet holes.\n''When you are from a developing country, you know better what all this destruction means,'' Colonel Gudiaby said softly in French. ''You are happy to help stop it.''"}, {"text": "AS THE WORLD LEARNS; Geography Quiz\n1989-04-09T05:00:00.000Z\nTo be globally educated is to be globally aware, an elusive notion that suggests a sense of one's geographical place in the world.

The conflict the Indians came to end is not over. On the contrary, the seeds of even more bitter battles have been sown.\nAt first glance, the two years that have passed since Indian forces arrived to disarm Tamil rebels seem to have brought worse disaster to Sri Lanka. The presence of Indian troops, the historical enemy of Sri Lanka's Sinhalese majority, rekindled a revolt by a Sinhalese nationalist group, the leftist People's Liberation Front.\nBy conservative estimates, 5,000 people have died since July 1987, when the guerrilla terror that had once been confined to the island's Tamil north erupted with even greater ferocity in the Sinhala south. An anti-Indian tirade soon became a full-fledged anti-Government campaign, first against President J. R. Jayewardene, who signed the agreement with India allowing the troops in, and then against his successor, Ranasinghe Premadasa, despite the current leader's consistent opposition to the Indian Army presence.\nThe violence led to more violence. The Sinhalese-dominated military trained its guns on other Sinhalese. Mysterious death squads formed. Thousands of people in Buddhist towns have been massacred, victims of the People's Liberation Front, the police and armed forces and, increasingly, the death squads, some of which are believed to be linked to politicians in the ruling United National Party.\nThe Sri Lankan north and east, now merged in a single Tamil-dominated province, is also not at peace. The province is likely to disintegrate if a promised referendum is held there because areas dominated by Sinhalese or Muslims, who consider themselves an ethnic group, will probably opt out. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the toughest guerrilla group, still roam in areas that have become virtual zones of Indian Army occupation. Other Tamil groups armed by the Indian peacekeeping forces to counter the Tigers' influence are certain to be the targets of Tiger vengeance when the Indians leave. Many Indians and Sri Lankans expect bitter fighting among rival Tamil armies, which have long tried to annihilate one another.\nIndia's costs have been high. India has lost at least 1,000 soldiers in Sri Lanka, where troops say they do not understand the purpose of the war, or why they are so despised by the Tamil population they thought they had come to save.\nThe reputation of India's army, one of the world's largest and most disciplined fighting forces, has been tarnished by a well-documented human rights reports accusing Indian troops of torture and the killings of dozens of civilian Tamils, particularly in the Jaffna Peninsula, the center of Sri Lankan Tamil culture. Broken Consensus\nAs the Indian venture in Sri Lanka ''blew up in our faces,'' in the words of a former Indian diplomat, a debate began in India on the country's regional policy. Rajni Kothari, a political scientist and leader of the Indian human rights lobby, said last week in New Delhi that the treatment of smaller nations in South Asia - not only Sri Lanka but also Nepal, with which India has a trade dispute, and Bangladesh, where joint discussions on ways to prevent floods have largely stalled - by the Government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has broken a remarkable four decades of Indian consensus on foreign affairs.\nIndia's determination to withdraw from Sri Lanka on its own terms and not in July of this year as President Premadasa had demanded also attracted international criticism, even from Moscow, New Delhi's traditional friend in world forums. Soviet officials told Indian reporters accompanying Prime Minister Gandhi to Moscow in July that India could not count on Soviet backing if Sri Lanka decided to take its case to the United Nations.\nSumit Chakravartty, a journalist writing in the left-of-center Indian journal Mainstream, said that one Soviet official told him that Moscow was ''opposed to the Balkanization of Sri Lanka,'' a response to suggestions in pro-Government Indian newspapers that Sri Lanka be partitioned into Tamil and Sinhalese areas as Cyprus was between Greek and Turkish zones.\nThere had been speculation in South Asia since Mikhail S. Gorbachev's last visit to New Delhi a year ago that India had been relegated to a lesser category as the Soviet Union paid more attention to its own economy and to improving relations with the West. Few would have predicted that India's Sri Lankan imbroglio, and not some larger international issue, would make that shift public."}, {"text": "No Headline\n1989-07-06T05:00:00.000Z\nINTERNATIONAL A3-10 Negotiations with the Palestinians by Israel seem unlikely since Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir agreed to be bound by hard-line conditions for conducting peace talks.

'A Bad Investment'\nMore than 28 million acres of forest and other woodlands are lost annually around the world, and at the current rate of deforestation it is projected that several countries, including El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nigeria and the Ivory Coast, will have destroyed all their forests in 30 years.\n''The study indicates that deforestation is a bad investment,'' said Charles M. Peters of the Institute of Economic Botany at the New York Botanical Garden, who headed the three-year study.\n''People who have wanted to save the forest using environmental arguments have not been very persuasive because many of these nations have a large debt,'' he said. ''But these findings offer a very powerful argument for forest conservation.''\nBrazilian Embassy officials in Washington said that while the study was being reviewed by scientists, the Brazilian goverment ''does not find the information surprising.''\n''Along with other reports like this and with work being done by our government, the study is likely to have an impact,'' said Vera Machado, counselor for environmental issues in the Brazilian Embassy. ''We expect that the deforestation will be decreasing.''\nSouth American governments, along with timber companies, miners and cattle ranchers, have been criticized by environmentalists, who contend that they have pursued large-scale clearing of forests to create farmland or sell timber without regard for the environmental impact. Brazil, for example, offered economic incentives to private entrepreneurs from 1965 to 1983 to invest in cattle ranching, a policy environmentalists say promoted the destruction of thousands of acres of woodlands. Link to Disasters Seen\nAmazon forests are regarded as among the richest and most diverse in the world and the source of hundreds of varieties of edible fruits, oils, as well as virtually untapped medicinal products, The clearing of tropical forests contributes to the warming of the atmosphere, and ultimately to the greenhouse effect, because the giant trees contain large amounts of carbon that are released when they rot or burn.\nIn addition, the destruction of forests in many countries has led to several disasters, says World Watch Institute, an environmental research group in Washington. Rainfall runoff, accelerated by deforestation, has triggered widespead flooding in Bangladesh, India, the Sudan, Thailand and elsewhere.\nThe new study showed that 12 products, primarily edible fruits and latex, found in one hectare, about 2.5 acres, of forest at the village of Mishana, in northeastern Peru near the Brazilian border, are worth $6,330 if sold in local markets over 50 years, with the cost of harvesting deducted from the market price.\nThe study also showed that the same land if used as a timber plantation would produce $3,184 over the same period, and that if converted to cattle pastures, it would be worth $2,960. 'A Way of Life'\nDr. Peters said people who live in the region harvest and sell all of the products that were detailed in the study, and for many it is their main source of income. The study was also based on the work of Alwyn H. Gentry of the Missouri Botanical Garden and Robert O. Mendelsohn of Yale University.\nSome researchers, while agreeing that the study provides important new data, said the value of edible fruits and other produce arrived at by Dr. Peters's group might be artifically inflated due to market conditions.\nIf the forests were managed and large quantities of produce were gathered and sold, the market price could drop significantly, said Susana Hecht, who specializes in economic and environmental development of the Amazon at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. First Detailed Accounting\nWhile scientists have believed for many years that the harvest produced in certain regions of tropical rain forests is economically valuable, the study provides the first detailed accounting.\n''The problem is that we have never been able quantify those benefits to convince these nation's ministers of this,'' said Raymond Rowe, a forestry adviser at the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\nScientists and economists also said that as soil in regions of cleared forest has become fragile after short periods of use, farming has not produced the levels of economic success originally expected.\n''It apppears that keeping it as managed forests has greater economic value,'' said Lester B. Lave, an economist and environmental expert at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh.\n''Brazil has a rapidly growing population and must look to the forest to provide them with a place of employment,'' he said. ''Instead of cutting it and using it for farmland, they now might consider developing it as managed forests.''"}, {"text": "THEATER; Life and Death Are the Actors On Her Stage\n1989-04-23T05:00:00.000Z\nOn stage, a grieving old man paces, mutters, groans, finally exploding into words. It is a speech from ''Titus Andronicus,'' Shakespeare's early, rarely performed drama of revenge, pitting Romans against Goths, with unhappy endings for all.\nDeborah Warner, the director - wearing a white cable-knit sweater, black jeans and black loafers - sits quietly, smoking, in the front row of Peter Brook's Bouffes du Nord theater in Paris, watching her Titus, the Scottish actor Brian Cox, plot doom for his enemies. This run-through is largely for the benefit of the technical crew, who must orient themselves to the Bouffes before the March 22d opening.\n''Titus'' has sometimes been considered too histrionic for production: a young woman is flung down on her husband's dead body and raped by his killers, two brothers who then cut out her tongue and hack away her hands to render her incapable of communicating their identities. Her father's vengeance is equally terrifying.\nBut the Royal Shakespeare Company has been playing this violent, emotional piece for the last two years, infusing it with Ms. Warner's characteristic mixture of intensity and dark humor. During a recent six-week tour that took the production to Spain, France and Denmark, the play - which lasts almost four hours in this uncut version - got standing ovations. In Paris, the tiered scaffolding of the set, created at the Swan Theater in Stratford-on-Avon, looked right at home among the crumbling splendor of the Bouffes.\nMs. Warner, who turns 30 next month, grew up near Stratford in the Cotswolds and admits that Mr. Brook's productions have been an inspiration. ''I did not see his 'Titus' with Laurence Oliver and Vivien Leigh, because it was before I was born. But my older brother dragged me to Brook's 'Midsummer Night's Dream' when I was 10,'' she said, ''for which I thank him.''\nFor someone whose style has evolved from bare-bones minimalism on small stages, Ms. Warner's jump to prominence has been astonishing. She recently won the Laurence Olivier award as best director of 1988 for ''Titus'' and has been mentioned as a candidate to replace Terry Hands as the R.S.C.'s artistic director; he announced earlier this month that he will step down in 1991.\nMs. Warner, one of a new wave of women directors of classic plays at Stratford last summer, including Di Trevis and Garry Hynes, has, in the opinion of some critics, risen right to the crest. ''Of all the Englishwomen, Ms. Warner is the one who has made the greatest impact,'' wrote Mel Gussow of The New York Times. ''As demonstrated by both 'Titus Andronicus' and 'King John,' she has a visceral sense of theatricality. In her hands, plays draw an immediate responsiveness from the audience.'' It is Ms. Warner's goal in staging Shakespeare to pitch her public into the Elizabethan mood; in this sense, the audience plays a vital role in her productions, and so does every actor on stage: there is no star system, and even the smallest roles are personal creations.\nLast season, Ms. Warner tackled Sophocles' ''Electra'' at the Pit Theater of London's Barbican center. Writing in The International Herald Tribune, the critic Sheridan Morley called it ''an intense, almost religious experience on a bare stage through which runs a river turning slowly to blood.''\nAt the Paris rehearsal of ''Titus,'' Ms. Warner, with her modest, unruffled manner, seems distanced from all the blood and thunder. She finds it hard to express her vision in conversation, saying only, ''A love of the words and a very unacademic approach is what I have, and an absolute love of acting.''\nThere are no theater people in her family. ''But,'' she says with a laugh, ''I was raised by an English eccentric.'' She is the youngest of three children, and her father, a Quaker, was an antiques dealer. ''I grew up surrounded by the most wonderful Elizabethan objects; if I have any visual sense, it comes from that.''\nHer productions are characterized by bold approaches to stage design and an anachronistic mix of costumes. ''Minimalist design is complex, actually,'' she says. ''The space itself is the central inspiration. It should be like Elizabethan theater - Shakespeare could take you from the fields of France to the fields of England because there were bare boards.''\nIn the city of Oxford, where she completed her secondary schooling, Ms. Warner became involved in university productions, and later took a stage-management course in London. ''But the big thing was being on my own in London, going to the theater nightly,'' she recalls. ''It was a good time - the R.S.C. was doing the War of the Roses trilogy.''\nWhen she was 21, she founded the Kick Theater Company. It was aptly named, because the classics with a kick is what she delivered, putting on Brecht, Buchner and Shakespeare with no funds, no attempt at historical grounding, no sets - just odds and ends from the family antiques shop. The Kick's first production, in Oxford in the summer of 1980, was Brecht's ''Good Woman of Szechwan''; the company was in residence in Edinburgh from 1981 to 1985.\nHer 1985 ''King Lear'' attracted a sudden rush of publicity and brought her name to the attention of the R.S.C. Terry Hands had asked Mr. Cox - who starred with Glenda Jackson that year in a production of Eugene O'Neill's ''Strange Interlude'' seen in London and on Broadway -to play the lead in ''Titus Andronicus.''\n''I said, 'I'll do it, but I want to take risks,' '' recalls the 52-year-old Mr. Cox, who was also to win a Laurence Olivier award for ''Titus.''\n''I had heard about this girl, and I felt she would be a breath of fresh air in the English atmosphere of good, slightly tight-sphinctered theater,'' he says. ''Deborah's incredibly open; she doesn't go around wearing that director's badge. She never stood in my way with 'Titus.' She works like a gardener: prepares the bed, plants the seed, waters it and watches it grow.'' He adds, ''She has something modest, but she's tough, hard, cunning, believe me. Deborah's ageless - when she sprang out of the womb, she was already 40.''\nMr. Cox punctuates this rehearsal by rushing to adjust the tilt of a bucket of blood. Lumbering about, a chef's apron tucked around his ample body, he is preparing Titus's revenge scene - a feast for Tamora, Empress of the Goths, whose sons have raped and mutilated his daughter, Lavinia. First he kills the villainous pair, then grinds their bones and bakes a pie of them.\nTwo rows of waiters, at the command of Titus the master chef, carry the feast table onto the stage of the Bouffes. They are whistling an ominous work song that sounds strangely like the one from Walt Disney's movie of ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.''\n''Yes,'' Ms. Warner murmurs, alluding to the music. ''British critics raised brows, but we kept it in because I believed we could use some relief.''\nEstelle Kohler, who is playing the Goths' Empress, swoops on stage. ''Welcome, dread Queen,'' Titus greets her, making a flying leap onto the table.\nMs. Warner rarely interrupts the rehearsal; she believes in giving her actors leeway and feels that a lot of their inventiveness comes through play.\nAfter the run-through, Sonia Ritter, who plays the ravished Lavinia as a quivering, wounded bird, sits in the Bouffes restaurant having a cup of soup. This is not an easy part to shake off; she looks as if she will never warm up. To prepare for her role, she visited shock and trauma victims in hospital wards. ''Deborah is marvelous that way; she lets you try out your idea, and if it doesn't work, you find out soon enough,'' the actress says. ''She is always watchful and helpful; she sees the play every other night. When we were in Madrid, we started to slow down for the foreign audience, but it got so grim that Deborah said, 'Forget language differences - go for it!' ''\n''You cannot direct this play in the late 1980's,'' says Ms. Warner, ''without showing rape for what it is - a denial of the human being - and that's what Sonia has acted, very bravely.\n''Imagine writing a mute role into your play!'' the director exclaims. '' 'Titus' is a young man's play, no question of that; an experimental play that has its echoes in 'Lear,' 'Othello,' 'Macbeth.' Shakespeare did not write it just for the murders, mutilations and cannibalism, but to show the other side: why these things happen to people, how they develop, and what they learn.''\nMs. Warner's interspersing of black comedy with the gruesome goings-on sends her audiences reeling abruptly from stunned grief to hysterical laughter. ''And we've had a lot of fainting - five faints in a night once,'' she recalls. ''I'd rather have a conscious audience.''\nShe is happy, she says, to have done plays with such strong women's parts. In the title role of ''Electra,'' she cast the Irish-born actress Fiona Shaw, who will play the wife of the 19th-century explorer Sir Richard Burton in Bob Rafelson's new movie, ''Mountains of the Moon,'' now being filmed.\n''Once I chose 'Electra,' I spent weeks terrified of it,'' Ms. Warner says. ''The thing that frightened me is that I couldn't do what I could do with Shakespeare - I couldn't find any humor. Your support in Shakespeare is colossal; when you don't have those images and you don't have those metaphors, you're suddenly at sea. I believed there was a way of playing Greek tragedy that focused almost exclusively on the emotions. It needed an extraordinary actress, which we had in Fiona, but I wasn't able to help until she touched that intense emotion: then I could work, I could direct.''\nAn assistant comes over to show her one of the props for the run-through: the Parisian version of Titus's macabre pie, fresh from the oven: it is exquisitely fluted, topped by a small pastry rose. The director bursts out laughing. ''Why, it's very pretty,'' she exclaims. ''It's very French, isn't it? The trouble is, Titus could never have made that pie - it has to be 10 times bigger, and rough-hewn.''\nMs. Warner is used to dealing with the unexpected on tour. From the start, she has traveled widely with her productions, taking the Kick's ''King Lear,'' for example, to Yugoslavia, Egypt and Israel. Recently she was in Bucharest, where she saw a Rumanian version, which she says still haunts her, of ''King John'' - the play she mounted last summer at Stratford and that will soon move to London.\nTwo years ago, she was invited to go to Bangladesh by the British Council, a government-backed organization that promotes British culture abroad. ''The idea was to send a director to work with Bangladeshi actors on Shakespeare,'' she says. ''The play was 'The Tempest,' ill chosen in many ways, since it was the time of the floods. I had to convert them to the play, because they wanted to do a tragedy, and they expected to perform in cloaks and gowns, as they'd seen on television.\n''The idea people have of Shakespeare comes from BBC television movies, which have bred the most terrible cliches. Shakespeare hands you extraordinary circumstances, full of contradiction; those who try to iron out the contradictions make me very angry. They are great dramas because they are like life: wretched, awkward, confusing - let's honor them in that way.''\nTouring, she thinks, is a vital way of touching the present. ''I'm more in my times than anywhere else,'' she says. ''I've never approached any of these plays in their historical context; above all, I want to speak for now. There is a lot of Bangladesh in 'Electra' because of that trip. A great many actors and directors feed on that which they make, not that which happens to them - that's where they go wrong.''\nMs. Warner's next project will be to prepare ''The Good Woman of Szechwan'' for a November opening at the National Theater in London. ''It was the first play I ever directed,'' she recalls. ''I'm going to open at the Olivier, the National's biggest theater, and it couldn't be more different from the church hall in Oxford where I first directed it - but in a way, I've come full circle.''\nYet she admits that the Brecht, which will reunite her with Ms. Shaw, will call for fresh resources of her imagination. The huge Olivier stage contrasts sharply with the intimate, black-box theaters in which her past successes have been shaped. Ms. Warner sees this new production as ''completely challenging - which is the reason to do anything.''\nAnd then? ''A lot of people want me to do a new play,'' she says, ''but I will still concentrate on the classics because they are the bigger plays. I'm interested in an emotional depth; it has to be about life and death. I don't want to direct a play about social security.''"}, {"text": "Dozens Die in Cold Weather in South Asia\n1989-12-31T05:00:00.000Z\nAt least 75 people, many of them homeless, have died of exposure to the cold in northern India and Bangladesh during the last three days, news reports said today.\nTemperatures plummeted to near freezing, chilling people who have little in the way of clothing or shelter to cope with the brief winter in this normally hot, sunny region.\nForty-four people in Bangladesh have died since Wednesday, newspapers in Dhaka said.\nIn India during the same period, 20 people have died of the cold in Bihar state, 7 in Uttar Pradesh state and 4 in Gujarat, the Press Trust of India reported.\nAlthough midday temperatures have reached the low 60's, many people are not equipped to cope with temperatures dropping to around 40 at night, even those with shelter.\nMost of Bangladesh's people live in houses with mud floors and walls made of thin straw mats.

Their misgivings have been deepened by recent estimates of the cost of limiting emissions of carbon dioxide, which is the primary cause of the problem.\nEconomic analysts do not speak with one voice on the issue. But all recent studies, including those carried out by environmentalists, implicitly share one conclusion: unless it proves remarkably easy to adapt technologies that drastically cut the need for oil, natural gas and coal, the price of correcting the carbon dioxide problem will run to trillions of dollars through the next century.\nBy one pessimistic but not implausible estimate, the United States' annual cost of holding the line on carbon dioxide production could rival the current level of military spending. Obstacles to Consensus\nEconomists also agree that the benefits of reducing carbon dioxide are sure to vary greatly from place to place. That will make it difficult for countries to develop a consensus for a collective response to the problem.\nCarbon dioxide and other pollutants trap infrared radiation from the sun in the earth's atmosphere, in much the same way a greenhouse works.\nSome effort to curb carbon dioxide may eventually prove to be a cost-effective means of coping with the greenhouse effect. But in the near term, most economists conclude, a major effort to limit carbon effluent makes little economic sense unless it can be justified on grounds of energy security or tax revenue. Overwhelmed Natural Processes\nScientists have long understood that certain trace-gases in the atmosphere efficiently trap solar energy and heat the planet. Some are naturally produced. But many, notably carbon dioxide, methane and chlorofluorocarbons, are also byproducts of modern civilization, and are being spewed out faster than the biosphere can neutralize their effects. It is now generally if not universally believed that a resulting warming effect is overwhelming natural processes that tend to cool the atmosphere.\nHow fast the greenhouse gases are heating the air is not known. Neither the heating effect nor the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the air is thought to have direct effects on human health. But there is at least a chance that another century or perhaps less of unchecked accumulation would melt polar ice and alter weather patterns, leading to coastal flooding and radical changes in land fertility patterns.\nFor many environmental advocates, those who believe in the ethical obligation to pass on the biosphere intact to future generations, the policy message is clear and simple: move quickly to reduce the production of carbon dioxide, which accounts for about half the greenhouse effect. Using Fear to Get Action\nThe cause has drawn support from diverse interests who share what David Harrison of the National Economic Research Associates consulting firm, calls ''the Christmas tree view.'' These groups hope to use greenhouse worries as a lever for everything from promoting nuclear power to tightening automobile mileage regulations.\nThis month, all 68 nations taking part in a high-level conference in the Netherlands agreed that carbon dioxide emissions would have to be stabilized.\nOnly objections from the United States, the Soviet Union and Japan prevented the conference from endorsing a goal of cutting emissions to 1988 levels by the year 2000. But William Nitze, a State Department official coordinating Bush Administration policy, acknowledges there is now heavy diplomatic pressure for an accord next year. Simulations by Computer\nGreenhouse politics have yet to be influenced by sober economic analysis, however. And while environmental groups would generally be inclined to draw different lessons from a new utility-financed simulation by Alan Manne of Stanford University and Richard Richels of the Electric Power Research Institute, almost everyone agrees that the computer model does illustrate the potential cost dimensions of carbon-dioxide containment.\nThe Manne-Richels model compares a hypothetical future of unconstrained carbon dioxide output with one in which carbon emissions are limited to the 1990 rate through 2000 and then gradually cut by 20 percent.\nEven if no technological adaptation to break the link between energy production and fossil fuels proved possible, consumers could muddle through for a while by switching to natural gas, which delivers 70 percent more energy per pound of carbon effluent. But the carbon limit begins to bite deeply around the year 2010.\nWith cheap supplies of gas exhausted, the model estimates that a twentyfold increase in the price of coal would be needed to force sufficient changes toward energy conservation. Annual losses in output would reach about 5 percent of national income, or about $500 billion, in the year 2030.\nOptimists, including the economist Irving Mintzer of the World Resources Institute, argue that technological innovations might sharply cut these costs. And the computer model bears him out. Some reasonably priced way of trapping smokestack carbon would reduce the economic impact by one-tenth.\nA low-cost source of electricity from non-carbon fuels, providing solar, nuclear or geothermal energy, would trim it further. Technical change that increased the efficiency of energy use for the entire economy by 1 percent each year at low cost would do yet more. Drop in American Incomes\nBut even the happy circumstance of technological victories on every front would still permanently reduce American incomes by about 1 percent, according to the Manne-Richels model. And 1 percent in a $5 trillion economy is a whopping $50 billion a year.\nOther studies suggest that this most optimistic Manne-Richels scenario is too optimistic. William Nordhaus, an economist at Yale University, pegs the cost of containing carbon emissions to 1990 levels at 1 percent to 2 percent of national income by the middle of the next century. A study in progress by the Congressional Budget Office is reportedly yielding numbers in the same range.\nHigh cost alone need not rule out action, of course, if the alternative is catastrophe. The mere possibility that the greenhouse effect could lead to greater climatic changes in the next 100 years than those experienced in the previous 10,000 might be expected to give even the most detached bean-counters cause to lose sleep.\nBut according to Thomas Schelling, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, such projections can be misleading. While climate has not changed rapidly in the last century, both the will and technological ability to adapt to radically different weather obviously has. In 1860, he says, 2 percent of Americans lived outside temperate or subtropical zones. By 1980, the percentage had increased to 22 percent. Adjusting to Climate Changes\nWhile changes in rainfall, temperature and sea level could be dramatic, there is yet no reason to believe that the process would be completed too quickly to allow evolutionary responses - expanding irrigation, for example, or building dikes. The cost of growing food might conceivably rise by 20 percent, Mr. Schelling speculates. But this loss, he argues, is almost certain to be overwhelmed by a century's worth of improvements in seed strains and growing techniques.\nBy the same logic, Mr. Schelling says, the appealing idea of bequeathing the biosphere intact seems arbitrary. The quality of life in 100 years, he suspects, will depend as much or more on the endowment of technology and capital as on the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air. And if money to contain carbon emissions comes out of other investment, future civilizations could be the losers.\nThis hardly means that the greenhouse effect can be safely ignored. But it does imply that it should be viewed as a problem in balancing costs against benefits. And here, crude initial estimates suggest that for the next half-century or more it may be cheapest to deal with the effects of global warming rather than the causes.\nFor example, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the cost of protecting America's coastal cities against a three-foot rise in sea level would be $73 billion to $111 billion, a lot of money but not so much compared with the likely cost of prevention.\nA doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide, likely to occur by the middle of the next century if output is not constrained, would dramatically reduce yields for some crops in some regions. But according to a 1989 study by three Agriculture Department economists, the net losses would be less than one-tenth of 1 percent of income in industrial countries. Argentina and Australia would actually be economic winners, since the likely fall in yields would be smaller than the increases in world prices. Nations Most at Risk\nThis illustrates a looming problem in prevention strategies. The benefits from controlling greenhouse gases would be far greater in some countries than in others. Bangladesh, India and the Netherlands are at great risk from coastal flooding. But many countries would be able to expand farming into regions that are now too cold or too dry to support it. And a few, like Saudi Arabia, would lose much of their national income in a successful attempt to curb the use of fossil fuels.\nThe costs of carbon conservation would vary enormously. China, for example, is counting on its rich supplies of coal to develop with limited dependence on imported energy and capital.\nYet without a broad, enforceable agreement on containing carbon, expenditures by individual countries would not pay off. Lester Lave, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University, argues that an early commitment by the United States to tough carbon standards could lead to the worst of both worlds. ''We pay attention to treaties,'' he says. But big carbon emitters like China and the Soviet Union might ignore their obligations, undermining the whole logic of collective action.''\nSuch considerations lead many economists, including Mr. Lave, to counsel waiting until more is known before trying to devise preventative measures. Dan Dudek, an economist for the Environmental Defense Fund, draws a different conclusion. He wants to buy a modest amount of insurance against the small possibility of a true greenhouse effect disaster, some as yet undiscovered ecological effect that is impossible to reverse.\nThis is the time, he argues, to experiment with flexible ''emissions-trading'' systems that ''improve the menu of options'' for slowing global warming at minimum cost. Electric utilities might, for example, buy the right to emit carbon from existing emitters, or plant a sufficient number of trees to absorb an equivalent amount of carbon effluent.\nMr. Nordhaus offers a different rationale for action soon. The potential damage from the greenhouse effect has not been pinned down yet, he concludes; but some damage is almost certainly being done. And any sensible approach to balancing costs and benefits in the future will almost certainly involve a limited attempt to control greenhouse gas emissions, along with parallel efforts to sequestor carbon and mitigate the effects of global warming. A Financial Incentive\nA modest tax on greenhouse gases, one targeted at heavily damaging chlorofluorocarbons as well as carbon dioxide, would thus be very likely to increase economic efficiency; it would also give emitters a financial incentive to search for alternative carbon-free technologies. And it could provide billions in taxes to offset the Federal deficit.\nVirtually all economists seem to agree on the need to get beyond what Mr. Lave calls the ''Earth Day come back'' syndrome. The symbol of greenhouse effect, they argue, cannot be allowed to obscure the dimensions of the perplexing, high-stakes problem that lies beneath."}, {"text": "Governments Start Preparing for Global Warming Disasters\n1989-11-14T05:00:00.000Z\nIN the quickening international debate over global warming, the spotlight has played mostly on the question of how and whether to control the growing emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat in the atmosphere.\nNow another concern is starting to come to the fore as well. No matter what action is taken, some scientists say, there are already enough of these ''greenhouse'' gases in the atmosphere to cause a major warming, and more are certain to accumulate before the buildup can be halted.\nAs a result, climatologists, social scientists, planners and government officials are beginning to focus on how society might adapt to rising sea levels, shifting agricultural zones, changing climates and other problems that global warming would bring if it occurs on a significant scale.\nAlready, state and local governments along the coast of the United States are starting to plan for a possible long-term rise in the sea level, and a few have taken action to cope with it. In the Netherlands, planning is well advanced for an expansion of that country's system of dikes, dunes and other coastal defenses, and the Dutch are also offering their expertise to Indonesia and the Maldives.\nAgricultural researchers are stepping up efforts to develop heat-resistant and drought-resistant crops that might gradually replace traditional crops if the climate changes.\nAnd the electric power industry in America is planning how to meet the increase in the demand for power for air-conditioning that would surely result from global warming. In one of the first studies, the Electric Power Research Institute has calculated that for every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit in climatic warming, power demand in the summer would rise 2 to 3 percent in the New York metropolitan area - enough to have a sizable effect on the region's limited generating capacity.\nThese stirrings are somewhat tentative, both because of uncertainty about the whole question of global warming and because of a tendency on the part of some environmentalists and politicians to play down the question of adaptation for fear it will divert attention from what they see as an overriding need to limit production of the greenhouse gases.\nBut reining them in is bound to be difficult. The world economy runs on fossil fuels, and burning these fuels generates increasing amounts of carbon dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas. Weaning the world away from them is likely to be a long and costly business. For developing countries especially, fossil fuels are tightly linked to prospects for development and a better life for their peoples, leaving those countries reluctant to give up the fuels.\nAs the difficulty of reducing greenhouse emissions has come home, the focus has shifted somewhat ''from prevention to a focus on adaptation,'' said Michael H. Glantz of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. Dr. Glantz, a social scientist, heads a group that studies the impact of climatic change on societies. And while a number of environmentalists, scientists and officials continue to believe that the first priority should be a reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases, some are now saying that adaptation must be considered as well.\nIn a report to President Bush earlier this year, the National Academy of Sciences argued that adaptive measures should be assigned a high priority. ''We are already irrevocably committed to major global change in the years ahead,'' the report said, expressing the view prevalent among climatologists. ''The elevated concentrations of greenhouse gases produced to date by human activities will persist for many centuries and will slowly change the climate of the earth, regardless of our actions.''\nStill, although many scientists agree on the broad outlines of global climate change, the system is so complex they cannot predict exactly how great the change will be or when and how it will affect specific regions.\nThis uncertainty means that in planning for a broad range of long-term activities like coastal development, construction of ports, location of waste-disposal sites, water projects and agricultural enterprises, flexibility is crucial, the academy told Mr. Bush.\nIn studying and planning for the expected impact of global warming, the Environmental Protection Agency is emphasizing this need for flexibility. ''You've got to leave yourself leeway,'' said John Hoffman, the director of the agency's global change division.\nThe planning options for industrialized countries, with all their resources, are numerous, the academy's report said. But that is not the case for many developing countries. For instance, a one-meter rise in sea level, which some experts consider likely by the end of the next century, would cover broad areas of Bangladesh, Indonesia and Southeast Asia holding some of the world's largest populations and richest agricultural lands. Those countries, experts say, simply do not have the resources to deal with such a disaster.\nSome experts, moreover, express concern that the industrialized countries, following a well-documented human tendency, will not take adaptive action until disaster is near, when it may be too late. The Science Complexity Makes Prediction Chancy\nIn the greenhouse effect, energy from the sun is trapped in the earth's atmosphere by carbon dioxide, methane, chlorofluorocarbons and other trace gases. The more gases, the more heat is trapped.\nCarbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas, is emitted by the burning of fossil fuels. Scientists say atmospheric concentrations of all these gases combined have increased from about 280 parts per million of carbon dioxide at the start of the industrial age almost 200 years ago to the equivalent of 400 parts per million today. At the present rate of increase, scientists say that the level will grow to 570 parts per million, more than double the pre-industrial level, possibly as early as 2030.\nScientists calculating from mathematical models of the earth's atmosphere say this doubling could cause the atmosphere to warm by 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit. By comparison, the atmosphere has warmed by about 9 degrees since the end of the last ice age. But climatic and atmospheric change is so complex that there is great uncertainty about the predictive accuracy of the models.\nHow long it will take for maximum warming to be reached is uncertain because the oceans slow such warming. Most scientists expect the maximum warming to take place by the second half of the next century.\nIf change is slow enough, the Environmental Protection Agency said earlier this year in a report to Congress, adaptation may be manageable. But a sudden or rapid change, it said, might make it problematic. Sea-Level Rise Defending Coasts Is a Concern\nA rise in sea level is ''one of the most certain impacts of climate change,'' the agency said in its report to Congress. Higher global temperatures would probably cause glaciers to melt, as well as leading to an expansion of the oceans because warm water occupies a larger volume of space than cold water. If levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere double, sea levels will rise; estimates of the average rise are from 1.5 feet to 6.5 feet. Some leading experts regard a rise of 1 meter, a little more than three feet, as most likely. They expect it to occur gradually in the next century, affecting coastal areas where about a billion people, a quarter of the world's population, now live.\nIn adapting to global warming, ''the primary issue is coastal defense,'' said Michael Oppenheimer, a senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund. ''Planning for sea-level rise must be done decades in advance of the actual unfolding of the consequences. If you're going to protect such areas with seawalls, or carry out a careful retreat of populations, which will be inevitable in some cases, or protect houses, those are measures that must be planned many decades ahead of time.''\nGjerrit P. Hekstra, an ecologist in the environmental protection branch of the government of the Netherlands, said defending a settled coastline or coastal city from rising seas requires ''a complete restructuring of your hydrological infrastructure - ship channels, dikes, canals, rivers, everything.''\nDr. Hekstra's country has been doing that for many decades, and the experience of the Netherlands may prove instructional for much of the rest of the world. For the Dutch, adapting to a sea-level rise means simply an expansion of the elaborate, modern coastal defense system it has developed in the last 30 years. Government studies have shown that to protect the country from a sea-level rise of 1 meter will require an investment, over the long term, of up to $10 billion. The Netherlands has already spent $15 billion on coastal defense in the last three decades.\nCoastal defense means building dikes and piling up sand on the coast to strengthen dunes and sculpting rivers and canals to keep sea water from penetrating the soil and ruining both fresh water supplies and agricultural land. Dr. Hekstra said it is his opinion as a private ecologist that all this is well within existing technology and requires only money.\n''So I don't think your country and my country is the real problem,'' he said. That is not to minimize the problem, he said, since the United States would have to spend billions of dollars to defend coastal cities and developments against a one-meter rise in sea level and might well have to abandon some low-lying regions altogether.\n''We can cope,'' Dr. Hekstra said. ''But not Indonesia, not Bangladesh, not Vietnam. They don't have the resources to do it. Who's going to pay the bill for the developing countries?'' In the United States, the E.P.A. has made extensive studies of the effect of a rise in the sea level, and most coastal states are beginning to plan for it. Questions being examined include not only coastal defense but matters like beach erosion and the intrusion of salt water into rivers and bays where it would foul drinking-water supplies. Possible solutions to salt-water intrusion include the construction of barrier dams in estuaries and canals to divert the salt water from drinking water intakes. Close attention is also being paid to the control of hazardous-waste disposal sites in areas likely to flood.\nMost of the efforts are in early stages. But ''I haven't talked to a single coastal state that isn't doing some hard thinking about this and where the government is starting to put together some plans,'' said Thomas W. Curtis, the director of the natural resources group of the National Governors' Association.\nSouth Carolina, North Carolina, Maine and Florida, with sea-level rise in mind, have all enacted standards designed to control construction on their shorelines. Water Resources Shortages Likely For California\nSome predictions of climate change, admittedly chancy, forecast drier conditions for much of the American West, with serious consequences for a region where water scarcity is already a major factor of life and prosperity. The E.P.A. study for Congress, for instance, found that California's water demand could increase, even as water supplies decrease. The decrease would come about partly because more snow would melt in the winter and less in the summer. Since reservoirs do not have the capacity to store all the winter runoff, spring and summer water supplies would drop.\nExperts say that a number of adaptive measures could help in such a situation. These could be as simple as lining irrigation systems so that less water is wasted or expensive solutions like building larger reservoirs or even such a harsh measure, should water become scarce enough, as imposing high prices on it.\n''Despite a growing awareness of the problem, the institutions involved in managing our water resources are not really taking account of the greenhouse effect,'' said Peter H. Gleick, director of the global environment program of the Pacific Institute for Studies in Development, Environment and Security, a nonprofit research institute in Berkeley, Calif.\n''The difficulty is that we don't know how precipitation patterns are going to change,'' said Dr. Oppenheimer of the Environmental Defense Fund. This, he said, underscores the limitations of adaptation. Agriculture Crop Adaptation Seems Promising\nNo more critical activity stands to be profoundly affected by global warming than agriculture, but scientists also consider it one of the most adaptable.\nAlmost all the crops now grown in the United States, for example, originally came from some other part of the world and were adapted to this continent.\nBuilding on this tradition, the Federal Department of Agriculture is preparing to ease the way for whatever transplants might be required by global warming. Jim Duke, an economic botanist at the department's research center in Beltsville, Md., has been collecting data for some years on the temperature and rainfall conditions in which 1,000 agricultural plants flourish. He is now preparing to use this data in mathematical models of climate, which would tell what crops would adapt best if, for instance, New York's average temperature rose three degrees and its rainfall also increased.\nThe E.P.A. report to Congress said that warming might force abandonment of 10 to 50 percent of the Southeast's agricultural acreage.\n''We might lose the conventional crops'' in the Southeast, said Dr. Duke. ''But assuming we didn't go dry, we would bring in semitropical crops. It's just a matter of selecting variety. We could bring in a wealth of tropical fruits and vegetables.''\nAt the same time, agricultural researchers around the world have long been striving, through both genetic and cultivation techniques, to make many crops more adaptable to harsh environments. Gary Evans, a special assistant for global change issues at the Department of Agriculture, said, ''We are augmenting most of our current plant-stress programs with an eye to what would take place if temperature or moisture shifted.''\nResearchers are also striking out in new directions with important implications for adaptation to global warming. At the University of Arizona, for instance, researchers led by Carl N. Hodges are experimenting with getting plants to grow in sea water. If they succeed, the technique could save fresh water in arid areas near oceans.\nIn Israel's Negev Desert, a team led by Yosef Misrahi of Ben Gurion University of the Negev is growing fruits and nuts at temperatures higher than 115 degrees. In the same area, the Jewish National Fund, the Israeli agency in charge of forestry and land conservation, is experimenting with a genetically improved species of loblolly pine, using seedlings donated by the Georgia-Pacific Corporation. Much of this sort of research is directly related to the prospect of global warming. Prospects Seeds of Change In Hurricane\nEven before Hurricane Hugo, Charleston, S.C., was attuned to two of the major effects scientists expect from global warming: a rising sea level and more frequent and more potent hurricanes. It had already required new buildings near the shore to be built far enough off the ground to escape flooding, which they did in the hurricane. The city had also begun installing pumping stations to insure proper drainage, unlike the situation with sewers that work by gravity, which do not drain when rising water covers their outlets.\nBut the hurricane certainly made a difference. ''The hurricane deepened our resolve,'' Mayor Joseph P. Riley of Charleston said, ''and made us more confident that our decisions along those lines were wise ones, and it certainly deepened our commitment to new ways of thinking and acting.''\nThat, according to the conclusions of a study directed by Dr. Glantz of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, is how action to combat a long-term threat usually gets started. A number of case studies sponsored by the center found that a catalyst was usually necessary before governments would act. Once they did act, ad hoc responses were favored over longer-term, planned responses.\nThese responses, the study concluded, ''have often built into the existing social structures an additional degree of rigidity'' that make it more difficult to adapt flexibly.\nThose charcteristics illustrate the difficulties of adaptation, Dr. Glantz said, especially in a situation so fraught with uncertainty as global warming, where the threat, however serious it ultimately proves to be, may not become readily apparent for years or even decades."}, {"text": "PARIS GROUP URGES 'DECISIVE ACTION' FOR ENVIRONMENT\n1989-07-17T05:00:00.000Z\nThe leaders of the Group of Seven industrial democracies today signaled a shift to a new realm of concern by dedicating a third of their final communique to an appeal for ''decisive action'' to ''understand and protect the earth's ecological balance.''\nConcluding one of their most harmonious summit gatherings ever, the seven nations also endorsed Washington's strategy for encouraging banks and third world nations to negotiate the terms of debt reductions; expressed prudent confidence in the general state of the world economy, and agreed to set up a task force to combat the laundering of money earned through drug trafficking. United Nations Aid Sought\nAsserting that ''the drug problem has reached devastating proportions,'' the seven leaders called for enlisting the United Nations ''to counter drug production, to reduce demand and to carry forward the fight against drug trafficking itself and the laundering of its proceeds.'' [ Text, page A7. ] While expressing concern, and at times alarm, about the environment, the leaders from Western Europe and North America fell short of making any firm commitments to remedy the situation.\nThe shift toward a new global agenda was underscored, too, by the detailed attention given by the seven leaders over dinner last night to a letter from Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet President, offering to integrate the Soviet Union ''fully and completely into the world economy'' and to help resolve the issue of third world debt.\nSummarizing the summit's deliberations at a news conference at the gleaming Arche de la Defense on the western outskirts of Paris, President Francois Mitterrand said that the seven leaders did not consider it necessary to respond collectively to Mr. Gorbachev's missive but that they ''hoped for the success of the democratization under way in the Soviet Union.'' 'We Will Contribute'\n''We are not charged with assuring its success but, to the extent that we can do so, we will contribute,'' said Mr. Mitterrand, who was host to Mr. Gorbachev during an official visit to Paris this month.\nChancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany effusively welcomed the Gorbachev initiative, but President Bush echoed Mr. Mitterrand's caution, saying it would take greater ''manifestations of freedom'' before the Soviet Union could become a full-fledged economic interlocutor for the seven.''\n''I think it's very premature,'' President Bush told a news conference. ''There's an awful lot that has to transpire in the Soviet Union, it seems to me, before anything of that nature could be considered here. We're talking about free market economies here.''\nSpeaking on the lawn of the American embassy residence, Mr. Bush said that he did not think the time was yet right for a summit encounter with Mr. Gorbachev and pronounced the Paris gathering ''a clear success'' that had been ''a watershed on the environment.''\nThe exceptionally smooth three days of deliberations in Paris were helped by a moderately buoyant world economy and the sharp reduction of East-West tensions that has flowed from Mr. Gorbachev's reforming efforts at home. President Bush also facilitated the discussions in Paris, European officials said, by his non-confrontational manner and his willingness to see the European Community take the lead on shaping policy toward Eastern Europe.\nAlthough the seven leaders were in a self-congratulatory mood on the world economy, they did not openly address troubling issues like the large American budget deficit and its contribution to high interest rates and third world debt. Moreover, hopes that Mexico would reach agreement here with its bank creditors on lowering its debt, in line with conditions laid down by Washington, were dashed.\nIn a break with recent summit practice, the seven nations today said nothing specific about their objectives for the dollar. High-ranking American and European delegates explained privately that the summit partners wanted to avoid any possibility that financial markets might determine that the Paris gathering had taken a new initiative on the dollar. Committed to Earlier Policy\nRather, the officials said, the seven remained committed to the policy announced at a finance ministers' meeting in April. That policy stated that a rise in the value of the dollar or any ''excessive'' decline would be ''counterproductive'' to the health of the world economy.\nMr. Mitterrand and other leaders concurred in highlighting the imperiled environment as a compelling issue.\n''The interaction between man's activities and the global environment is such that if we are to pass on the heritage safe to our children's future, we must take action now,'' Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain told a news conference before leaving Paris. ''That is the imperative.'' After calling for ''decisive action,'' the seven nations also pledged ''to work together to achieve the common goals of preserving a healthy and balanced global environment in order to meet shared economic and social objectives and to carry out obligations to future generations.'' Several Environmental Issues\nThe communique touched on virtually every major environmental issue, but offered no commitments to the problems, which include reducing carbon dioxide emissions even though the United States, Japan, Britain, West Germany, France, Italy and Canada account for about 40 percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions generated by fossil fuel combustion.\nInstead, the seven said they ''strongly advocate common efforts to limit emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which threaten to induce climate change, endangering the environment and ultimately the economy.'' Third World Debt Stance\nDespite its cautious tone, the communique did endorse the innovative notion of forgiving in ''special cases'' some third world debt in exchange for commitments to protect the environment.\nThe communique also urged giving ''specific attention'' to moving beyond the landmark Montreal Protocol of 1987 to eliminate the production of ozone-depleting gasses like carbon tetrachloride, halons and meethylchloroform.\nSeveral senior European officials said that the importance of the lengthy environmental declaration was not in its specifics but rather in having the issue so solemnly enshrined in a summit communique for the first time. One European Community official observed that the leaders ''have raised public expectations, and at next year's summit in America people are going to ask them what they've done in the meantime.''\nOn the topic of drugs, the summit nations announced that they and ''other countries interested in these problems'' would set up a task force to tighten efforts to prevent banks and other financial institutions from being used for the laundering of drug money. Some estimates put drug revenues at $300 billion.\nThe task force will have the mandate to consider new measures ''including the adaptation of the legal and regulatory systems so as to enhance multilateral judicial assistance.''\nMr. Mitterrand, the sole Socialist leader among the seven, had sought to use the summit gathering to advance the cause of heavily indebted third world nations. Inviting several African, Asian and Latin American leaders to the bicentennial celebrations of the French Revolution - which overlapped with the economic summit - he sponsored the idea of another so-called North-South summit on the model of the Cancun gathering in Mexico in 1981. Proposal Rebuffed\nBut this proposal was quietly rebuffed by the summit partners. Mr. Mitterrand finally was left with little to show for his engagement aside from backing in the communique for World Bank studies on the flooding in Bangladesh - after France had pushed for a $5 billion embankment undertaking there - and verbal support for the establishment of observatories to monitor land erosion in Saharan nations.\nIn backing the debt-reduction plan outlined by United States Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady last March, the summit did not incorporate elements of a more generous proposal outlined by President Mitterrand that would have effectively used taxpayers' money to ease the debt burden weighing on the third world.\n''We stress that official creditors should not substitute for private lenders,'' declared the communique, embracing the spirit of the Brady approach."}, {"text": "Key Sections of the Paris Communique by the Group of Seven\n1989-07-17T05:00:00.000Z\nFollowing are key sections of the communique issued today by the Group of Seven major industrialized democracies:\n1. We, the heads of state or government of seven major industrial nations and the president of the Commission of the European Communities, have met in Paris for the 15th annual Economic Summit. The Summit of the Arch initiates a new round of summits to succeed those begun at Rambouillet in 1975 and at Versailles in 1982. The round beginning in 1982 has seen one of the longest periods of sustained growth since the Second World War. These summits have permitted effective consultations, offered the opportunity to launch initiatives and to strengthen international cooperation.\n2. This year's world economic situation presents three main challenges:\n* The choice and the implementation of measures needed to maintain balanced and sustained growth, counter inflation, create jobs and promote social justice. These measures should also facilitate the adjustment of external imbalances, promote international trade and investment, and improve the economic situation of developing countries.\n* The development and the further integration of developing countries into the world economy. Whilst there has been substantial progress in many developing countries, particularly those implementing sound economic policies, the debt burden and the persistence of poverty, often made worse by natural disasters affecting hundreds of millions of people, are problems of deep concern which we must continue to face in a spirit of solidarity.\n* The urgent need to safeguard the environment for future generations. Scientific studies have revealed the existence of serious threats to our environment such as the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer, excessive emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases which could lead to future climate changes. Protecting the environment calls for a determined and concerted international response and for the early adoption, worldwide, of policies based on sustainable development. International Economic Situation\n3. Growth has been sustained by focusing policies on improving the efficiency and flexibility of our economies and by strengthening our cooperative efforts and the coordination process. In the medium term, the current buoyant investment seen during this period should pave the way for an increased supply of goods and services and help reduce the dangers of inflation. The outlook is not, however, without risks.\n4. Until now, the threat of inflation in many countries has been contained, thanks to the concerted efforts of governments and monetary authorities. But continued vigilance is required and inflation, where it has increased, will continue to receive a firm policy response. . . .\n5. While some progress has been made in reducing external imbalances, the momentum of adjustment has recently weakened markedly; there needs to be further progress in adjusting external imbalances through cooperation.\n6. In countries with fiscal and current-account deficits, including the United States of America, Canada and Italy, further reductions in budget deficits are needed. Action will be taken to bring them down. This may help reduce the savings-investment gap and external imbalances, contribute to countering inflation and encourage greater exchange rate stability in a context of decreasing interest rates.\n7. Countries with external surpluses, including Japan and Germany, should continue to pursue appropriate macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that will encourage non-inflationary growth of domestic demand and facilitate external adjustment.\n8. All our countries share the responsibility for the sound development of the world economy. Over the medium term, deficit countries have to play a key role in global adjustment through their external adjustment and increased exports; surplus countries have to contribute to sustaining global expansion through policies providing favorable conditions for growth of domestic demand and imports.\n9. The emergence of the newly industrializing economies and the initiation of a dialogue with them are welcome. We call on those with substantial surpluses to contribute to the adjustment of external imbalances and the open trade and payments system. To that end, they should permit exchange rates to reflect their competitive position, implement GATT commitments and reduce trade barriers. International Monetary Developments and Coordination\n10. Under the Plaza and Louvre agreements, our countries agreed to pursue, in a mutually reinforcing way, policies of surveillance and coordination aimed at improving their economic fundamentals and at fostering stability of exchange rates consistent with those economic fundamentals.\nThere has been progress in the multilateral surveillance and coordination of economic policies with a view to ensuring internal consistency of domestic policies and their international compatibility. . . .\n11. The coordination process has made a positive contribution to world economic development and it has also contributed greatly to improving the functioning of the International Monetary System. There has also been continued cooperation in exchange markets.\nIt is important to continue and, where appropriate, to develop this cooperative and flexible approach to improve the functioning and the stability of the International Monetary System in a manner consistent with economic fundamentals. . . .\n12. We welcome the decision to complete the work on the ninth review of the International Monetary Fund quotas with a view to a decision on this matter before the end of the years.\n13. Within the European Community, the European Monetary System has contributed to a significant degree of economic policy convergence and monetary stability. Improving Economic Efficiency\n14. We will continue to promote measures in order to remove inefficiencies in our economies. . . . Tax reforms, modernization of financial markets, strengthening of competition policies and reducing rigidities in all sectors including energy, industry and agriculture are necessary. So are the improvement of education and vocational training, transportation and distribution systems and further policies aimed at giving more flexibility and mobility to the labor market and reducing unemployment.\nWithin the European Community, the steady progress toward completion by the end of 1992 of the program contained in the Single Act has already given a strong momentum to economic efficiency.\n15. The decline of saving in some of our countries in this decade is a cause of concern. This lower level of saving can contribute to high real interest rates and therefore hamper growth. Inadequate saving and large fiscal deficits are associated with large external deficits. We recommend . . . policies to encourage saving and remove hinderances. . . .\n16. Financial activities are being increasingly carried out with new techniques on a worldwide basis. As regards insider trading, which could hamper the credibility of financial markets, regulations vary greatly among our countries. These regulations have been recently, or are in the process of being strengthened. International cooperation should be pursued and enhanced. Trade Issues\n17. World trade developed rapidly last year. Yet protectionism remains a real threat. We strongly reaffirm our determination to fight it in all its forms.\nWe agree to make effective use of the improved GATT dispute settlement mechanism and to make progress in negotiations for further improvements. We will avoid any discriminatory or autonomous actions, which undermined the principles of the GATT. . . .\nWe also are pledged to oppose the tendency toward unilateralism, bilateralism, sectoralism and managed trade which threatens to undermine the multilateral system and Uruguay Round negotiations.\n18. The successful negotiation of the Trade Negotiations Committee of the Uruguay Round in Geneva last April, thereby completing the midterm review, is a very important achievement. It gives a clear framework for future work in all sectors including the pursuit of agricultural reform in the short term as well as in the long term. . . .\nWe express our full commitment to making further substantive progress in the Uruguay Round in order to complete it by the end of 1990.\n19. We note with satisfaction the entry into force of the Free Trade Agreement betwen Canada and the United States, as well as more recent initiatives to intensify the close economic relations between the European Community and E.F.T.A. countries. . . .\n20. It is the firm intention of the European Community that the trade aspects of the single market program should also be trade-creating and complementary to the multilateral liberalization process. 21. We note with satisfaction the progress that has been made in strengthening the multilateral disciplines on trade and aid distorting export credit subsidies. This effort must be pursued actively and completed in the competent bodies of the O.E.C.D. . . . at the earliest possible date. General Problems Of Development\n22. Development is a shared global challenge. We shall help developing countries by opening the world trading system and by supporting their structural adjustment. We shall encourage too, economic diversification in commodity-dependent countries and the creation of a favorable environment for transfers of technology and capital flows.\nWe underline the continuing importance of official development assistance and welcome the increased efforts of summit participants in this respect. . . .\n23. We urge developing countries to implement sound economic policies. A vital factor will be the adoption of financial and fiscal policies which attract inward investment and encourage growth and the return of flight capital.\n24. We note with satisfaction that there has been substantial progress in the multilateral aid initiative for the Philippines that was given special attention in the Toronto economic declaration. 25. Faced with the worrying economic situation of Yugoslavia, we encourage its Government to implement a strong economic reforms program that can command bilateral and multilateral support. The Situation In the Poorest Countries\n26. The enhancement of the International Monetary Fund Structural Adjustment Facility, the World Bank special program of assistance for the poorest and most indebted countries and the fifth replenishment of the African Development Fund are all important measures. . . . We stress the importance attached to a substantial replenishment of Intenational Development Association resources.\n27. As we urged last year in Toronto, the Paris Club reached a consensus in September 1988 on the conditions of implementation of significant reduction of debt-service payments for the poorest countries. Thirteen countries have already benefited by this decision.\n28. We welcome the increasing grant element in the development assistance as well as the steps taken to convert loans into grants and we urge further steps. . . . Flexibility in development aid as much as in debt rescheduling is required. 29. We attach great importance to the efficient and successful preparation of the next general conference of the United Nations on the least developed countries, which will take place in Paris in 1990. Strengthened Debt Strategy for the Heavily Indebted Countries\n30. Our approach to the debt problems has produced signficant results, but serious challenges remain: In many countries the ratio of debt service to exports remains high, financing for growth promoting investment is scarce, and capital flight is a key problem. An improvement in the investment climate must be a critical part of efforts to achieve a sustainable level of growth without excessive levels of debt. These improvements . . . depend above all on sustained and effective adjustment policies in the debtor countries.\n31. To address these challenges, we are strongly committed to the strengthened debt strategy. This will rely, on a case-by-case basis, on the following actions:\n* Borrowing countries should implement, with the assistance of the Fund and the Bank, sound economic policies, particularly designed to mobilize savings, stimulate investment and reverse capital flight;\n* Banks should increasingly focus on voluntary, market-based debt and debt-service reduction operations, as a complement to new lending;\n* The International Monetary Fund and World Bank will support significant debt reduction by setting aside a portion of policy-based loans;\n* Limited interest support will be provided, through additional financing by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, for transactions involving significant debt and debt service reduction. For that purpose the use of escrow accounts is agreed;\n* Continued Paris Club rescheduling and flexibility of export-credit agencies;\n* Strengthening of the international financial institutions capability for supporting medium-term macroeconomic and structural adjustment programs and for compensating the negative effects of export shortfalls and external shocks.\n32. In the framework of this strategy:\n* We welcome the recent decisions taken by the two institutions to encourage debt and debt service reduction which provide adequate resources for these purposes;\n* We urge debtor countries to move ahead promptly to develop strong economic reform programs that may lead to debt and debt service reductions in accordance with the guidelines defined by the two Bretton Woods institutions;\n* We urge banks to take realistic and constructive approaches in their negotiations with the debtor countries and to move promptly to conclude agreements on financial packages including debt reduction, debt service reduction and new money. We stress that official creditors should not substitute for private lenders. . . . Environment\n33. There is growing awareness throughout the world of the necessity to preserve better the global ecological balance. This includes serious threats to the atmosphere, which could lead to future climate changes. We note with great concern the growing pollution of air, lakes, rivers, oceans and seas; acid rain; dangerous substances; and the rapid desertification and deforestation. . . .\nDecisive action is urgently needed to understand and protect the Earth's ecological balance. We will work together to achieve the common goals of preserving a healthy and balanced global environment in order to meet shared economic and social objectives. . . .\n34. We urge all countries to give further impetus to scientific research on environmental issues, to develop necessary technologies and to make clear evaluations of the economic costs and benefits . . .\nIn this connection, we ask all countries to combine their efforts in order to improve observation and monitoring on a global scale.\n35. We believe that international cooperation also needs to be enhanced in the field of technology and technology transfer in order to reduce pollution. . . .\n36. We believe that industry has a crucial role in preventing pollution at source, in waste minimization, in energy conservation, and in the design and marketing of cost-effective clean technologies. The agricultural sector must also contribute to tackling problems such as water pollution, soil erosion and desertification.\n37. Environmental protection is integral to issues such as trade, development, energy, transport, agriculture and economic planning. Therefore, environmental considerations must be taken into account into economic decision-making. . . .\nIn order to achieve sustainable development, we shall ensure the compatibility of economic growth and development with the protection of the environment. Environmental protection and related investment should contribute to economic growth. . . .\nClear assessments of the costs, benefits and resource implications of environmental protection should help Governments take the necessary decisions on the mix of price signals (e.g. taxes or expenditures) and regulatory actions, reflecting where possible the full value of natural resources.\nWe encourage the World Bank and regional development banks to integrate environmental considerations into their activities. . . .\n38. To help developing countries deal with past damage and to encourage them to take environmentally desirable action, economic incentives may include the use of aid mechanisms and specific transfer of technology. . . .\nWe also emphasize the necessity to take into account the interests and needs of developing countries in sustaining the growth of their economies and the financial and technological requirements to meet environmental challenges.\n39. The depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer is alarming and calls for prompt action.\nWe welcome the Helsinki conclusions related, among other issues, to the complete abandonment of the production and consumption of chlorofluorocarbons covered by the Montreal protocol as soon as possible and not later than the end of the century. . . . We shall promote the development and use of suitable substitute substances and technologies. . . .\n40. We strongly advocate common efforts to limit emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which threaten to induce climate change, endangering the environment and the economy. . . .\n41. We agree that increasing energy efficiency could make a substantial contribution to these goals. We urge international organizations concerned to encourage measures, including economic measures, to improve energy conservation and, more broadly, efficiency in the use of energy. . . .\nWe are committed to maintaining the highest safety standards for nuclear power plants and to strengthening international cooperation in safe operation of power plants and waste management, and we recognize that nuclear power also plays an important role in limiting output of greenhouse gases.\n42. Deforestation also damages the atmosphere and must be reversed. We call for the adoption of sustainable forest management practices, with a view to preserving the scale of world forests. . . .\n43. Preserving the tropical forests is an urgent need for the world as a whole. While recognizing the sovereign rights of developing countries to make use of their natural resources, we encourage, through a sustainable use of tropical forests, the protection of all the species therein and the traditional rights to land and other resources of local communities. We welcome the German initiative in this field as a basis for progress.\nTo this end, we give strong support to rapid implementation of the Tropical Forest Action Plan which was adopted in 1986 in the framework of the Food and Agricultural Organization. . . .\n45. The increasing complexity of the issues related to the protection of the atmosphere calls for innovative solutions. New instruments may be contemplated. We believe that the conclusion of a framework or umbrella convention on climate change to set out general principles or guidelines is urgently required. . . .\nWe welcome the work under way by the United Nations Environment Program, in cooperation with the World Meteorological Organization, drawing on the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the results of other international meetings. . . .\n46. We condemn indiscriminate use of oceans as dumping grounds for polluting waste. . . .\n47. We are committed to insuring full implementation of existing rules for the environment. In this respect, we note with interest the initiative of the Italian Government to host in 1990 a forum on international law for the environment. . . .\n48. We advocate that existing environment institutions be strengthened within the United Nations system. In particular, the United Nations Environment Program urgently requires strengthening and increased financial support. . . .\n50. It is a matter of international concern that Bangladesh, one of the poorest and most densely populated countries in the world, is periodically devastated by catastrophic floods.\nWe stress the urgent need for effective, coordinated action by the international community, in support of the government of Bangladesh, in order to find solutions to this major problem which are technically, financially, economically and environmentally sound. In that spirit, and taking account of help already given, we take note of the different studies concerning flood alleviation, initiated by France, Japan, the U.S. and the United Nations Development Program, which have been reviewed by experts from all our countries. We welcome the World Bank's agreement, following those studies, to coordinate the efforts of the international community so that a sound basis for achieving a real improvement in alleviating the effects of flood can be established. . . .\n51. We give political support to projects such as the joint project to set up an observatory of the Saharan areas, which answers the need to monitor the development of that rapidly deteriorating, fragile, arid region. Drug Issues\n52. The drug problem has reached devastating proportions. We stress the urgent need for decisive action, both on a national and international basis. We urge all countries, especially those where drug production, trading and consumption are large, to join our efforts to counter drug production, to reduce demand, and to carry forward the fight against drug trafficking itself and the laundering of its proceeds.\n53. Accordingly, we resolve to take the following measures within relevant fora:\n* Give greater emphasis on bilateral and United Nations programs for the conversion of illicit cultivation in the producer countries. The United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control (UNFDAC), and other United Nations and multilateral organizations should be supported, strengthened and made more effective. These efforts could include particular support for the implementation of effective programs to stop drug cultivation and trading as well as developmental and technical assistance.\n* Support the efforts of producing countries who ask for assistance to counter illegal production or trafficking.\n* Strengthen the role of the United Nations through an increase in its resources and through reinforced effectiveness of its operation.\n* Intensify the exchange of information on the prevention of addiction, and rehabilitation of drug addicts.\n* Support the international conference planned for l990 on cocaine and drug demand reduction.\n* Strengthen the efficiency of the cooperative and mutual assistance on these issues, the first steps being a prompt adhesion to, ratification and implementation of the Vienna Convention on illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.\n* Conclude further bilateral or multilateral agreements and support initiatives and cooperation, where appropriate, which include measures to facilitate the identification, tracing, freezing, seizure and forfeiture of drug crime proceeds.\n* Convene a financial action task force from summit participants and other countries interested in these problems. Its mandate is to assess the results of cooperation already undertaken in order to prevent the utilization of the banking system and financial institutions for the purpose of money laundering, and to consider additional preventive efforts in this field. The first meeting will be called by France and its report will be completed by April 1990. International Cooperation Against AIDS\n54. We take note of the creation of an International Ethics Committee on AIDS which met in Paris in May 1989, as decided at the Summit of Venice (June 1987). It assembled the summit participants and the other members of the European Community, together with the World Health Organization.\n55. We take note of the representations that we received from various heads of state or government and organizations and we will study them with interest. Next Economic Summit\n56. We have accepted the invitation of the president of the United States to meet next year in the United States of America."}, {"text": "Long Island Q&A;: Robin Chandler Duke;\nSoldier in an Unpopular War: Population Control\n1989-02-05T05:00:00.000Z\nLEAD: FROM her Upper East Side apartment, Robin Chandler Duke may seem an unlikely soldier in what many consider a nasty battle: World population control and abortion rights.\nFROM her Upper East Side apartment, Robin Chandler Duke may seem an unlikely soldier in what many consider a nasty battle: World population control and abortion rights.\nBut for more than 40 years, Mrs. Duke, the wife of Angier Biddle Duke, former Ambassador to Morocco, Spain and Denmark and now president of Southampton College, has been fighting to make birth control an integral part of basic health care.\n''This is an issue that's not very popular,'' Mrs. Duke said in an interview in her Manhattan apartment (she and her husband also have a house in Southampton).\n''This isn't like fighting for the museum in your town or some great cultural endeavor that everybody wants to identify with. This is an issue that nobody much likes.''\nSince 1972, Mrs. Duke has been a national co-chairman of the Population Crisis Committee/Draper Fund, which finances the International Planned Parenthood Federation.\nMrs. Duke is also active in education, serving as vice chairman of the Institute of International Education, which processes student exchange programs in the United States, and is on the board of numerous organizations, including the Guggenheim Museum, International Flavors and Fragrances, the East River Savings Bank and the Rockwell International Corporation.\nOriginally a feature writer for The New York Journal-American, writing about what was then considered women's issues - fashion and society - Mrs. Duke, as a divorced mother of two, became one of the few female stockbrokers on Wall Street during the 50's, working for the firm of Orvic Brothers. Her subsequent years with Pepsi-Cola took her to Africa and the Soviet Union, where she met Angier Biddle Duke in 1959. \nQ. How did you become involved in family planning issues? \nA. I first became involved when I was a very young woman with two young children and lived in New York. I realized there were no girls' clubs, no facility for young girls to go off the streets of New York.\nI worked with another group of women to finance the first Girls Club, and became very interested in young girls and the aspects of their life in an urban area where they, even in those days, were from a one-parent family.\nI suddenly realized how these girls grow up in an environment where they are uneducated about fertility - ignorance is the bottom line. In those days, Margaret Sanger was alive and she was imprisoned on Rikers Island because she demonstrated, marched and was pushing family planning. Just think of it.\nIn my lifetime - I never thought of myself as being an antique, but I am 65 - this great lady, for the very fact that she prescribed artificial birth-control methods, was put in jail. It's amazing. \nQ. Do you think that things have changed much since the 40's in terms of the lack of education of poor women in matters of family planning? \nA. I'm ashamed to say that in the last eight years we've been set back quite critically. \nQ. You mean the Reagan Administration? \nA. Absolutely, and I hang a big black cloak around that Administration because of their fight against abortion rights. They supported this militant group who went out and demonstrated against Planned Parenthood and had people lying down in Planned Parenthood clinics where abortion services were offered. This kind of thing has set us back many decades.\nThey were against strong population policies within our Agency for International Development. That's where we provide foreign assistance money to inform, counsel and enlighten people about how to plan families. And these are in countries where they're overpopulated.\nThis whole movement was supported and abetted by the last eight years of a very, very poorly advised Administration as to what you should be doing in terms of foreign assistance and what you should be doing domestically for poor people. \nQ. Do you think things will improve under George Bush? \nA. Yes, I have high hopes. Mr. Bush is a man who has served in China as our representative and as a Congressman. During the days when he was in Congress, he was pro-choice on abortion. I don't know what turned him around. Maybe he felt he had to get that body of a minority to support him to get him elected, but he certainly wasn't anti-choice in the old days. \nQ. What areas of the globe face the greatest threat of overpopulation and, therefore, poverty? \nA. Africa is one of the more devastating continents in terms of hunger, environmental impact and overpopulation. Our very dear neighbors in Latin America have some of the highest incidence of illegal abortion in the world. That's because they can't get the access to family planning.\nThis is an ongoing battle with the church. If they can't get access to family planning, they resort to horrendous abortion techniques that very often render them ill and maimed and, very often, kill these women. \nQ. According to predictions, world population growth is going to be one of the big issues of the 90's. What are the implications for Americans? \nA. What we have to know in this sort of one-world concept is that, if the third world falls apart, it will have a direct impact on developed nations. The marketplace for all these great American corporations is ultimately that third world.\nIf that third-world element isn't going to develop, we have to bail them out. The third-world debt is monumental and this is a debt built out of enormous infusions of money, which they have had to borrow to keep going. Where, in fact, if they had basic education and health care, they would have the nucleus of the energy to get their economy rolling.\nYou have to have some other economic structures, and you have to get a hold on the numbers of people. If you don't, you are facing starvation, and the only people who are going to prop you up are the Western developed nations. \nQ. You mentioned that population is an environmental issue. How is that? \nA. Look at the great turtles of Indonesia. They're not coming back in such numbers along the shoreline to lay their eggs. Why?\nThe population of Indonesia has chopped down so much of the forest land in order to develop a little patch to grow their crops that they have practically killed off all the turtles and tigers that used to come there.\nThis is all a matter of too many people on a land base that can't support them. You could say the same thing for northern India and Bangladesh. They have chopped their forest lands down, and have created erosion and flooding, and then you don't have any agriculture because you've washed away your topsoil. \nQ. Even though much of your work has been focused on third world countries, how does America fare in terms of population control. Are we up to par? \nA. Our problem is not population control, it is education. Our problem is seeing that every child born has the fundamental rights, which are decent health care, to be nurtured and loved and to get an education.\nIn the United States, they have withheld important aspects of education because they won't Federally fund a system for sex education, which I think is vital. We keep hearing about the breakdown of the family in the United States, and there's no question that it's probably true.\nI think the schools have the responsibility, with Federal funding, to counsel young people about their sexuality in a constructive way. If they watch television and see salacious sex, then there must be something wrong with a society that isn't willing to deal with sex in an intelligent, normal way.\nContraception should be like toothpaste: it's basic to your health care. You brush your teeth and you use contraception. It ought to be in the medicine chest, and there shouldn't be any hiding under the rug and all this phony kind of nervousness about discussing sex. Sexuality is fundamental and it should be taught, starting with very young children. \nQ. Do you think it is the Federal Government's responsibility to step in and play a major role in family planning, or are birth-control and health issues up to the nonprofit, private sector? \nI think the private sector has a major role to play, and I think the Federal Government has a major role to play. We have a Surgeon General and we have a Department of Health and Human Services, and I think part of what you do for your people, when they cannot do it for themselves, is to have outreach from the Federal Government. \nQ. Do you believe in Federal funding for abortion? \nA. I certainly do. We have women who come in and can't afford anything, and it is my job as a private citizen to try to raise money so that those women will get those abortions if they can't afford it. \nQ. What do you think the future of legalized abortion is in this country? \nA. I think it's at a very high risk and we should be very worried about it. If it goes back to the states, it's going to be difficult to obtain an abortion. You're going to have some states that won't provide services at all.\nI've talked to a number of members of Congress who have told me, ''Well, you know I've been on your side, but basically it's too risky,'' and they don't want to get on this issue. And until people are courageous enough to be like Bob Packwood and others who have been our friends and supporters in the Senate, we lose out. \nQ. Are you planning to join the fight to keep abortion legal? \nA. We are mounting a very big campaign in the National Abortion Rights Action League about the ultimate effects of making abortion illegal, how it will impact on the poor and on the rights of women. These are fundamental rights we're talking about. I have people who are so angry with me about this, and they don't want to talk about it, and ''There goes Robin again - babble, babble, babble. I know what she's talking about. It's just distasteful, my dear.''\nIt's not distasteful. This whole subject matter should be part of health care. It is fundamental.

The 15 are Angola, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Haiti, Jamaica, Laos, Lebanon, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Peru, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sri Lanka, the Sudan and Vietnam.\nIn the Sudan, for example, the report predicts ''serious food supply difficulties.'' in the drought- and war-ravaged southern region unless emergency assistance ''is made available immediately.''\nImportant factors in declining grain production in the northern countries are the severe drought in North America last year as well as policy measures in the United States and Europe meant to curb surplus production. But in addition, many agricultural experts, citing the shortage of spare arable land in many parts of Asia and Africa, warn that some poor countries may be reaching limits of production.\nThe decline in production has meant a sharp fall in grain stocks, to about 16 percent of annual consumption, their lowest level since the early 1970's, and a rise of 40 to 50 percent in prices, Mr. Saouma said.\nA fall in global grain stocks below 17 percent of annual consumption leaves the world vulnerable to a food crisis if harvests fail again and invariably trigger a sharp rise in grain prices, the agriculture organization says. Higher world grain prices will mean better returns for the world's major grain-exporting countries, which include the United States, Canada, Western Europe and Australia.\nMr. Saouma stressed that while the richer industrialized countries can weather the current price rise, poor countries will need to raise spending on imported food from $12.3 billion in 1988 to $17.6 billion this year just to maintain the same, often indequate level of nutrition.\n''The increase in import costs will further worsen the balance of payments position of many of the low-income, food-deficit countries, which are already suffering from mounting external debt and adverse terms of trade,'' Mr. Saouma said. Less Famine Aid\nMoreover, the increase in the food costs for poor countries comes at a time when the quantity of free food that industrialized countries will provide for famine relief is expected to fall by about a quarter. This is because the donors generally budget cash sums for food assistance, and these buy less when grain prices rise.\nThe amount of free food Western industrialized countries will donate for famine relief in poor countries this year is likely to fall from the roughly 13.2 million tons they gave in 1988 to about 9.7 million tons, officials of the organization say.\nAs a result, officials say, some poor countries may be unable to maintain even last year's nutritional levels.\n''Over 500 million people are undernourished today and this is going to get worse,'' said James Ingram, head of the World Food Program, an agency affiliated with the agriculture organization that distributes food aid.\nIn a new effort to help the world's growing numbers of poor and hungry, agriculture ministers from 36 developed and developing countries, including the United States, will meet in Cairo on May 22 to consider a new action plan prepared by the World Food Council, a body set up within the organization in 1974 to review world agricultural policies.\nThe meeting will bring together ministers from countries representing 68 percent of the world's population and 75 percent of its wealth.\n''We've spent enough time analyzing hunger,'' said Gerald Trant, the World Food Council's director. ''The time has come to act.''\nIn its latest survey of world grain markets prepared for this week's meeting, the agriculture organization forecasts that total production of wheat and coarse grains like sorghum and corn will rise to 1.4 billion tons this year after dropping from 1.33 billion tons in 1987 to 1.25 billion tons last year.\nBut since the global rice harvest is unlikely to be much higher than last year's record, the organization believes that total world grain production will increase by about 150 million tons this year, or less than the 200 million tons it says is needed to rebuild stocks and bring output back into line with consumption trends."}, {"text": "Rushdie Is Still Planning to Visit U.S. Next Week\n1989-02-15T05:00:00.000Z\nA death sentence by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and other protests have not altered the plans of the novelist Salman Rushdie to come to the United States next week to promote ''The Satanic Verses,'' his American literary agent said yesterday.\n''As of now he will be here on schedule,'' said the agent, Andrew Wyley. ''I think some things will change, but his intention is to come to the United States to promote the book.'' The book has been on sale in American bookstores for several weeks.\nViking Penguin, which bought world rights to the novel, had scheduled an 11-city American tour for Mr. Rushdie, to include readings at four universities. That itinerary - scheduled to start next week, to coincide with the official American publication Feb. 22 - was largely completed before the book was banned in India last October.\nA Viking publicist suggested yesterday that in view of the recent violent protests, Mr. Rushdie might tape interviews to be broadcast.\nBoth Mr. Rushdie and Viking issued statements yesterday denying that the book was intended to defame or insult.\nIn a statement issued in Britain, Mr. Rushdie said: ''The novel is not an attack on Islam or any other religion, but an attempt to challenge preconceptions and to examine the conflict between the secular and religious views of the world. Ironically, it is precisely this conflict which has now engulfed the book.''\nHe added that many Muslim writers and readers had expressed support for the book and strong disapproval of the campaign against it.\nMr. Wylie said that two writers' groups, PEN and the Authors Guild, ''voiced their strong support for him.''\nAfter a meeting of Viking officials yesterday, the publisher released a statement deploring the violence and loss of life.\nThe book has now been banned in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt and South Africa.\nNoting the Khomeini threat and the violent protests over the book in Pakistan and India, the statement said: ''Neither we nor the author of this novel published this book with intent to offend. We very much regret the distress the book has caused.'' The statement added that publication of the novel ''rests upon the principle of freedom of expression, which is one of the cornerstones of all democracy.''\nIn December, Viking employees were forced to vacate their building on West 23d Street twice because of bomb scares over the book, but things appeared calm yesterday. The company has hired plainclothes security officers since those incidents, and they are posted at the front and rear entrances to the building. The Viking offices are on the fifth floor.\nThere were no demonstrators near the Viking office, and there were only a few phone calls all day protesting Viking's publishing ''The Satanic Verses.'' Asked if there has been any activity, a plainclothes security guard in the reception room replied, ''Not too much; it's been too quiet,'' emphasizing the word ''too.''"}, {"text": "About New York; A 'Mother' Waits With Open Arms At Ports of Call\n1989-05-13T05:00:00.000Z\nThe big man at the top of the gangplank wore lots of tattoos and a leer. ''Hiya, sister,'' he said. ''Welcome to the love boat.''\nThe Rev. Barbara C. Crafton, who has been called Sweetie, Cupcake, Honey Doll and more, was unabashed. The Episcopal priest, one of the first 50 women ordained in 1980, has visited some 4,000 ships and heard it all. Her ministry is to the 200,000 seafarers from 60 countries who call each year at ports in the area.\n''The job is real dirty and ugly,'' said Mother Crafton, as she prefers to be known, director of Seafarers' Services for the Seamen's Church Institute of New York and New Jersey. But the joy of comforting achingly lonely souls is immense. ''The smallest sort of thing you do is a big thing,'' she said.\nThings like distributing armloads of magazines, offering a lift to stores, arranging a phone call home, setting up a soccer game, counseling marriages split by half a planet and helping seafarers fight for what few rights they have. Mother Crafton has gone into lockers to administer last rites; in these days of refrigeration, bodies are shipped home rather than buried at sea. She has exorcised demons from unlucky vessels.\nIt is all some distance from Mora, Minn., the farm town where Mother Crafton grew up landlocked and driven by an ambition to go where not everyone was blond. Now 38 years old, she is sailing a voyage that has included study at Rutgers, Princeton and the General Theological Seminary; a marriage, two daughters and a divorce, and work from cabaret singer to parish priest.\nMother Crafton's love affair with the sea began when the seamen's institute - which is ecumenical but affiliated with the Episcopal Church - asked her to perform the Cole Porter songs she loves. She expected ''a swashbuckling bunch of beer-swillers.'' What she found were ''polite little Asian boys'' far, far from home.\n''I felt sorry for them,'' she said. Thus it was that\nMother Crafton left her New Jersey parish and went to work on the waterfront in 1983. It was a different waterfront from the wild and wooly one prevailing when the institute, in 1844, launched the first of three floating churches -steeples and all - that became East River landmarks. It was different, too, from the macho jungle Marlon Brando prowled in ''On the Waterfront.''\nFierce competition has changed the maritime industry. To raise productivity and slash costs, ships have become larger and more automated, carrying smaller crews and spending 12 hours rather than a week in port. Most now register under what are called flags of convenience - Panama's, say, or Liberia's - to avoid taxes and labor rules that American or European flags would mandate.\nToday's sailors come from the bargain basement, the villages of the third world. Mother Crafton tells of a Greek cruise ship in which 50 Bangladeshis in a crew of 600 were kept in despicable conditions: eight in rooms meant for two, no bedding, the toilet a smelly hole in the next room. Unlike sailors of other nationalities, the Bangladeshis were denied shore leave for fear they would bolt.\nMother Crafton knew she could not do much, but she attacked a particularly egregious insult - men who made 50 cents an hour having to pay 55 cents for a soda. She succeeded in forcing the price to 20 cents, but probably only for as long as the boat was berthed.\nShe has seen other bad things. A Filipino whose village scraped together $1,400 to pay his way to Miami so he could become an $800-a-month assistant chef. All that was available was a messboy's job at $200 a month.\nShe saw a Chinese seaman break his neck and slowly die on a cold December day. She tells of ships abandoned at New York docks and bewildered crews running out of food. Missing fingers are common. Some shipping companies keep such inadequate records that families aren't notified of a death. All they know is that the checks no longer come.\n''You don't have to treat people like dogs to make money,'' declared Mother Crafton, who admits the world labor market is sufficiently glutted that owners can make even more by doing precisely that.\nAnd there is the loneliness. Today's seamen are gone for a year at a stretch, missing children's births, parents' deaths. Mother Crafton fears the effects of the solace many seek from prostitutes. Seamen, she worries, could become Typhoid Mary's carrying AIDS far and wide. She has distributed 30,000 pamphlets warning of the dangers in six languages.\nMother Crafton doesn't force religion on people. But while chauffeuring three Colombian seamen from Red Hook Terminal in Brooklyn to the Fulton Street Mall, she did recall that some of Jesus's apostles were seamen.\n''This is neat work,'' she judged."}, {"text": "U.N. Critical of I.M.F. Austerity Plan\n1989-09-06T05:00:00.000Z\nAusterity measures imposed on the poorest countries by the International Monetary Fund as a condition for new loans, have produced no results, according to a United Nations report.\n''I guess you could say the sacrifices have been in vain,'' said Roger Lawrence, an official of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, referring to the reductions in social spending and the drop in living standards the austerity measures have caused.\nThat is one of the conclusions of the conference's annual report, scheduled for release Wednesday. The Geneva-based body is the main United Nations agency promoting the economic interests of the developing countries. The agency has often criticized the ways that industrialized countries have responded to economic conditions in poor nations. Foreign Debt\nThe report says there is a troubling split in world economic performance. While healthy growth has continued, both in the industrialized countries and in several developing countries - mainly in eastern Asia - the economies of the developing countries of Africa and Latin America have stagnated or worsened. The report attributed much of their plight to their large foreign debts.\nRecent initiatives, particularly by the United States and France, to forgive part of the debt are ''extremely welcome and positive,'' Mr. Lawrence said. However the conference argued that these measures would provide only about half the minimum debt reduction needed to spur economic growth.\nThe report examined the results of the adjustment programs adopted by the least developed countries to qualify for new I.M.F. loans. The United Nations has put 42 nations, with a combined population of more than 400 million, in this category. They all have very low per-capita income levels.\nThe report found that of the 12 least developed countries, which have applied such programs for most of the 1980's, the growth rates of only three - Bangladesh, Gambia and Mali -were above the average for all the least developed countries. ''The adjustment programs in the least developed countries have so far produced mixed results and achieved, at most, limited success,'' the report said. Detrimental Effects\nThe adjustment programs usually involve cutting public spending, devaluing the national currency to stimulate exports and reducing imports. By causing governments to reduce subsidies on food staples, such programs have provoked rioting, most recently in Venezuela.\nThe report said that often the main result of these programs had been a contraction of economic activity. Currency devaluation ''had little effect in stimulating exports in the least developed countries, but certainly created hardship, particularly to vulnerable groups,'' by raising prices, the report said.\nWhat is needed, it continued, is increased debt relief, more flexible adjustment programs and better access to industrialized countries' import markets."}, {"text": "THE WORLD; Why India Is Still Failing To Stop Its Population Surge\n1989-07-09T05:00:00.000Z\nWHEN India's Ministry of Health submitted its annual report to be considered in framing the country's 1989-90 budget, it included a cry for help. ''Population control can no longer be the responsibility of one ministry or department,'' it said. ''The entire planning process must be geared toward controlling population.''\nMore than four decades after independence, India, along with its neighbors Pakistan and Bangladesh, has not been able to control the relentless climb in the numbers of its people. Recent reports project that India, with at least 810 million people now, will pass one billion by the end of the century or soon after. If Beijing maintains its current population policies, India could overtake China as the most populous nation before the middle of the next century.\nIndia has brought its annual population growth rate down to about 2.1 percent, compared with 2.4 percent in Bangladesh and 3.2 percent or higher in Pakistan. But while improvements in agriculture have left Indians statistically able to feed themselves, population remains a source of grave concern in a country where food is not evenly distributed, forests are being razed for firewood or furniture, and good drinking water is scarce.\nIndian experts say large families are fostered by low literacy, high infant mortality, inadequate health care and a dearth of sustained information and follow-up services.\n''The illiterate peasant does not perceive the danger in numbers, in crossing the one billion mark,'' says India's leading demographer, Ashish Bose, who has done 30 years of field work in villages.\n''One of the major failures in India has been the lack of communication between our planners and policy makers and the masses,'' Mr. Bose, head of the Population Research Center of Delhi University's Institute of Economic Growth, said in an interview. ''We do not know how to communicate with illiterate people.'' Ads and Sterilization\nPopulation growth and fertility rates leveled off during the 1970's, and today Indian women still have on average of four to five children. Almost all efforts have been concentrated in the hands of the central Government working through local health authorities, an approach that some experts now question because the country is so culturally diverse.\nRadio and television advertising and information from community health centers bring to all India the message that small families are healthier and happier. But this apparently has not been enough. In Rajasthan, with India's fastest-growing population, a survey found that 97 percent of women who refuse birth control were well informed on family planning programs.\nSterilization accounts for at least 90 percent of the successes. Intrauterine devices are a distant second, and some pills and condoms are distributed. Many sterilizations are carried out in temporary ''camps'' where critics say unsanitary and impersonal conditions are a deterrent. Cash or other rewards are offered for being sterilized - up to $12.50 per person - but villagers say some people turn up several times to collect them, distorting the statistics.\nSuccessive Indian Governments have recognized the population problem since independence in 1947, when the population was 342 million. In 1966, family planning was given a department of its own within the Ministry of Health, a step some demographers say was a mistake, since it separated population control from the general Government overview of development. In the mid-1970's, the family-planning drive was endowed with coercive powers that were used by supporters of the late Sanjay Gandhi, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's son and adviser and the brother of Rajiv Gandhi, the present Prime Minister. After widespread reports of forced sterilizations, Indians rebelled.\nIn 1977, the country's four most populous states voted heavily against Indira Gandhi on this issue, and the Congress Party suffered its first election defeat. The next Government, under Moraji Desai, erased the words ''family planning'' from the books, renaming the program ''family welfare,'' a name still in use.\nBut Indian experts say it was not only the Sanjay Gandhi program that set back population control. In the 1950's and 60's, the country's priorities were on industrial development, and its limited resources went into huge energy projects, steel mills and the production of consumer goods to replace imports.\n''If we had concentrated more on the software, the human resources element - female literacy, education - in the 1950's and 60's,'' said Sam Pitroda, a science adviser to Rajiv Gandhi, ''we would have a population of about 600 million now.'' A Grave Mistake\nMr. Bose said India made a catastrophic mistake in the 1960's when it accepted Western advice about introducing birth-control technology but didn't put enough effort into education and cultural change. Hundreds of thousands of Lippes loops, an intrauterine device, were inserted and large-scale sterilization began. Dirty equipment and a lack of follow-up advice to women led to rampant infections.\nOver the years, offers of cash and other incentives were introduced for those willing to undergo sterilization, a tactic Mr. Bose calls ''madness.'' Today, 85 percent of sterilizations are done on women, many of whom already have three or four children.\nFinally, Mr. Bose said, bureaucrats were taught to set numerical targets, which over time proved of little use because official figures measuring performance are manipulated to meet the targets.\n''We must move away from cold calculations of aggregate numbers to people,'' Mr. Bose said, arguing for enforcement of a 1978 law prohibiting women below the age of 18 from marrying and a change in emphasis in family planning programs so they will aim more at young married couples as they begin having families.\n''Looking back,'' he said, ''high tech, money and the bureaucracy -all three have failed.''"}, {"text": "TALKING TWO MOTHER TONGUES\n1989-06-04T05:00:00.000Z\nLEAD: MEATLESS DAYS By Sara Suleri. 186 pp. Illinois: The University of Chicago Press. $17.95.\nMEATLESS DAYS By Sara Suleri. 186 pp. Illinois: The University of Chicago Press. $17.95. \nIn Pakistan, a common dinner-party conversation finds the guests fantasizing the deconstruction of the state. Ethnic tensions will send the province of Punjab back to India. The southernmost province, Sind, will become the independent Sindhudesh. The Pathans will join their tribesmen in Afghanistan to form Pukhtoonistan, and Pakistani and Iranian Baluchis will create Baluchistan. What's in a name? Pakistan, which in Urdu means ''land of the pure,'' is impure and troubled, a nation divided.\n''Meatless Days,'' Sara Suleri's first book, is a parallel exercise in postcolonial partition. Ms. Suleri's territory, though, is the self. In nine autobiographical tales that move easily back and forth among Pakistan, Britain and the United States, Ms. Suleri examines the names that describe her: Pakistani, sister, teacher (of English, at Yale), narrator with two mother tongues, Easterner in passage to the West. In the process she forays lightly into Pakistani history, and deeply into the history of her family and friends.\nAt the intersection of the two is the author's father, Z. A. Suleri, a prominent political journalist who lobbied hard for Pakistan's formation. His single-minded focus on the drafting of his country's history alienated him from successive Pakistani regimes (which jailed him) and successive children (who left him). The author's mother, Surraya, nee Mair Jones, was a Welsh teacher of English who chose to live with her husband in Pakistan but was never able to apprehend the country's customs; a ''guest in her own name,'' she bore four children and became an observer of almost saintly abstraction. ''Honestly,'' she probably would have murmured, had she seen her students beating up the driver of the motorcycle cab that struck and killed her.\nThe Suleri women at home in Pakistan, however, make this book sing. Grandmother Dadi's spine is bent, but her will is not. Scuttling about the house ''in the posture of a shrimp,'' she lectures her granddaughters on the evils of the opposite sex ('' 'For men,' said Dadi, shaking the name off her fingertips like some unwanted water, 'live as though they were unsuckled things' ''), and delivers denunciations of Satan while lying atop the dining room table. Ms. Suleri's beautiful sister Ifat sees two men brush their car against the author on a Lahore street - enraged, Ifat forces their car off the road with her own, then rams them repeatedly to the encouraging cheers of onlookers.\nHer half sister Nuz has a softer charm: reasoning correctly that ''no one will ever tow or touch anything that looks so forlorn,'' she parks her car by ''gaping'' it, pulling up anywhere she likes and opening trunk, hood and all four doors. Buying chicken for dinner, Nuz has the birds in her net bag before she remembers her housewifely duties: '' 'Are they fresh?' she squawked, clutching at them, 'Can you promise me they're fresh?' The chicken-monger looked at her with some perplexity. 'But Begum Sahib,' he said gently, 'they're alive.' ''\nBut maybe no good to eat. In ''Meatless Days,'' bad experiences with food often remind the Suleris to expect unpleasant surprises. Milk in the ''land of the pure'' turns out to be ''accidentally diluted'' with kerosene instead of water, and one week there's a dead crow in the drinking water. A bowlful of spicy tamarind sauce ends up on the author's lap rather than in her mouth, scorching ''passageways that as a rule I am only theoretically aware of owning.'' Dreaming that her dead mother is a vanload of frozen meat that must be fitted piece by piece into a coffin, Ms. Suleri steals a knuckle and hides it under her tongue. War with India sunders Bangladesh from Pakistan, Dadi is burned nearly to death in the kitchen, Ifat is killed by a hit-and-run driver and Ms. Suleri herself, working in the United States, finds that her boyfriend will share her bed but is too nervous to have a meal alone with her at home. Something is rotten in the state of nourishment.\nReaders looking for pat exoticism should look elsewhere. Like the novelist Anita Desai, whose mother was also European, Ms. Suleri is at home with cultural and linguistic differences, and well able to steer clear of subcontinental cliches. ''Meatless Days,'' like Ihab Hassan's earlier ''Out of Egypt,'' subjects Eastern autobiography to critical method, talking of discourse and context, calling attention to grammar and tense, taking one step back for analysis with every two it takes toward description. At its least compelling, Ms. Suleri's prose doubles back on itself until it collapses in a heap of cerebral metaphors: ''I try to lay the subject down and change its clothes, but before I know it, it has sprinted off evilly in the direction of ocular evidence.''\nMore often the writing is beautifully constructed and yet a little cold; Sara Suleri expertly paces out the boundaries of her subject without giving the reader the pleasure of getting inside. ''Remember,'' she tells one of her brothers, ''that I've lived many years as an otherness machine.'' It would be nice to see that sentence in the simple past tense. GOOD FOR HYGIENE, BAD FOR CONSERVATION \n The country was made in 1947, and shortly thereafter the government decided that two days out of each week would be designated as meatless days, in order to conserve the national supply of goats and cattle. Every Tuesday and Wednesday the butchers' shops would stay firmly closed, without a single carcass dangling from the huge metal hooks that lined the canopies under which the butchers squatted, selling meat, and without the open drains at the side of their narrow street ever running with a trace of blood. On days of normal trade, blood would briskly flow, carrying with it flotillas of chicken feathers, and little bits of sinew and entrail, or a bladder full and yellow that a butcher had just bounced deftly into the drain. On meatless days that world emptied into a skeletal remain: the hot sun came to scorch away all the odors and liquids of slaughter and shriveled on the chopping blocks the last curlicues of anything organic, making them look both vacant and precise.\nAs a principle of hygiene I suppose it was a good idea although it really had very little to do with conservation: the people who could afford to buy meat, after all, were those who could afford refrigeration.

Plans 1.3% Rise In Long-Distance Rates\n1989-11-17T05:00:00.000Z\nEight months after the Government approved a method for setting long-distance rates that was expected to lower consumers' telephone bills, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company said yesterday that it would raise prices on domestic long-distance service.\nA.T.&T. said it planned to raise its rates for night and weekend calling an average of 1.3 percent on Nov. 29. The increase will raise about $34 million a year, it said, and cost customers 3 cents a month on an average residential telephone bill. Night and weekend calls are made between 11 P.M. and 8 A.M. weekdays, all day Saturday and until 5 P.M. Sunday.\nAlthough the rate increase is relatively small, consumer advocates said it could spell an end to the trend toward declining long-distance rates and might also set a precedent for A.T.&T. to put sudden rate increases into effect. New Regulatory Format\nA.T.&T. said the rate increase is allowed under the regulatory change approved by the Federal Communications Commission in March. That permitted the company to set its own prices for long-distance services within certain ceilings and floors prescribed by the agency.\nThe new regulatory format allows A.T.&T. to change its rates on 14 days' notice, instead of the 45 days required under the commission's previous form of regulation, which was known as the rate-of-return approach and limited A.T.&T.'s profit from its long-distance business.\nThe price caps allow A.T.&T. unlimited earnings from long-distance and give the company incentives to cut costs, the F.C.C. said; the floors prevent it from undercutting competitors.\nThe No. 2 and No. 3 long-distance companies, the MCI Communications Corporation and the U S Sprint Communications Company, respectively, are not subject to F.C.C. regulation and have generally offered long-distance service at rates slightly below those of A.T.& T. Rates Rising to Ceiling A.T.&T. said the price increase announced yesterday would bring night and weekend rates for residential consumers up to the ceiling of allowable rates. It said current long-distance rates were sharply lower than they would be under rate-of-return regulation.\nA.T.&T. said yesterday that its rates for business customers were priced at about 95 percent of the maximum allowed by the commission.\nDavid Wagenhauser, a spokesman for the Telecommunications Research and Action Center, a Washington consumer group, said the rate increase showed that A.T.& T. planned to keep rates for residential customers ''at the maximum'' while it offered business customers discounts.\n''It's Wall Street and not Main Street U.S.A. that is seeing the benefits of price caps,'' Mr. Wagenhauser said. ''This is just a signal of who will bear the brunt of the new system.''\nWhen the change in regulation took effect in June, residential long-distance rates dropped $97 million. They later fell an additional $48.8 million when the regional phone companies reduced the rates they charge long-distance carriers for connecting to their networks. F.T.C. Statement\n''The commission is never happy to see a rate increase of any kind and we will review it and makes sure that it complies with the established rules of the price cap system,'' said Richard Firestone, chief of the F.C.C.'s common carrier bureau. ''People should understand that this rate increase is just part of the system, and we fully anticipate that there will be future decreases in rates over time.''\nThe F.C.C. has said the new price-cap system will reduce long-distance bills by $900 million in the next four years, with $700 million going to residential customers and $200 million to businesses.\nA.T.&T. also said it planned both to raise and lower its rates for international calling, depending on the country called. Calls to Rumania, Suriname and Macao would increase 20 percent; calls to India would drop to $4.20 from $4.50 for the first minute and to $2.04 from $2.77 for each additional minute, and calls to Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal would drop to $4.45 from $4.90 for the first minute. The new international rates become effective Dec. 30."}, {"text": "India's Bleakest Corner Is Where All Hope Ends\n1989-09-11T05:00:00.000Z\nIn an era when it is common to talk of Asian economic miracles and a Pacific century, the Indian state of Rajasthan is a reminder that there are, in reality, two Asias. There are the economic tigers and would-be tigers from Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Thailand, but also the struggling, crowded, volatile nations of South Asia, especially India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, where survival is difficult.\nIn many ways, Rajasthan reflects South Asia's problems.\nPopulation is a major contributor to the widening gap between the two Asias. India Today, the country's leading news magazine, has estimated, based on current population trends, that within decades India will be the world's poorest country. With a current population of 810 million and a growth rate of 2.1 percent a year, the magazine estimates that by early in the next century India will have well over a billion people, with the world's largest numbers of illiterates and homeless - 600 million in each category - and 400 million unemployed.\nRajasthan, a northwestern state on the Pakistan border, has the country's fastest-growing population with an annual increase of 2.8 percent. Land and vegetation are visibly running out. Urban areas, including Jaipur, the 18th-century ''pink city'' that was once a model of town planning, are overrun by the poor. Where India's Troubles Are Coming Together\nIn ecology, nutrition, culture and politics, Rajasthan is a demographer's laboratory, and some of India's most creative research into the complex problems of population growth, human development and adjustment to a changing environment is being done here.\nIn a region with a distinctive culture, art portrays the plight of the Rajasthani countryside and recently inspired a collection of short poems, ''Footprints in the Sand,'' by Amit Jayaram. One of the poems says: The animals' feet leave their print on the desert's face. Hunger is so real, so very real, that it can make you walk around a barren tree looking for nourishment. Not once. Not twice. Not thrice. . . .\nFormerly the domain of Hindu Rajput maharajahs whose courts and cultures had come under strong Islamic influence, Rajasthan, with 44 million people, is now statistically a part of the nation's largest demographic bloc: the Hindu, Hindi-speaking belt of northern states that also includes Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and parts of Haryana. The area dominates Indian politics, a source of irritation to parts of the country where social and economic advances have been greater.\nIn the Hindi belt, where 40 percent of Indians live, literacy and the status of women are lower than in other states. More and more Indians regard those factors as major causes of a national failure to curb population growth. Rajasthan Ranks Last In Almost Everything\nRajasthan has a literacy rate of 24 percent, the lowest of all the major states, according to the 1981 census (the next will be in 1991). Only 5 percent of rural Rajasthani women read or write, and fewer than 10 percent of girls from age 5 to 9 attend school. Between a ninth (in cities) and a third (in rural areas) of all Rajasthani workers are 14 years old or younger, often a reflection of their economic importance to families.\nChild marriage is the norm, in defiance of national laws that set the legal age for women at 18 and for men at 21. Many Rajasthanis see this practice as a social necessity. A girl married before or at puberty is considered safe from extramarital sex and the stigma of out-of-wedlock pregnancy, which could result in her murder at the hands of outraged relatives.\nThirty-year-old Kamla lives in the village of Kotri, northeast of Ajmer and a few miles from Sambhar Salt Lake. The land here is not as good as it is farther north, where irrigation projects have been started, or as bad as the deserts to the west. The soil is not unlike the rest of north India's scrub land.\nFarming on a self-sustaining scale is not possible in Kotri, and families depend on sheep and goats. The dirt roads are choked by herds being led in search of food. Camels are harnessed to plows where arable fields exist. A camel can look after itself, the local people say, letting the men of Kotri concentrate on their wool-and meat-producing flocks.\nMrs. Kamla, the daughter of a Brahman who allowed her to learn to read and write, thinks for a few minutes when asked how Rajasthan's growing population has affected Kotri, a town with a few hundred families living in small houses of concrete or stone. Lacking Land, Many Are Forced to Leave\n''There is less and less land,'' she says in Hindi, through an interpreter. ''Every year the water in the ground is more saline. Water is a big problem.\n''More people have to migrate, and migrate farther and farther, to find enough food for the animals,'' she says.\nThe lengthening winter and spring migrations, sometimes involving treks of hundreds of miles to the neighboring states of Madhya Pradesh or Gujarat, uproot entire families. Birth control can seem pointless when a father needs extra shepherds to patrol the edges of the wandering flocks, Mrs. Kamla says.\nThere are other migrations, too. From villages like these, thousands of Rajasthani men and women go to cities as far away as New Delhi or Bombay in search of manual work, often on construction sites.\nIn Kotri, Mrs. Kamla, is trying to make changes. She is working through the Social Work and Research Center, a nongovernmental development organization in Tilonia, 40 miles to the south. She is a woman in one of India's most male-dominated states, where village women, approached by outsiders, cover their faces with shawls or bright-colored saris. But Mrs. Kamla's high caste gives her standing, and village men acknowledge her as a leader. A Different Concept Of Population Control\nMrs. Kamla is trying to promote population control in Kotri by persuading women to use family planning services available at Government clinics. The mother of two girls, she seems skeptical of experts who say Indians will continue to have children until they have had enough boys, usually two, to guarantee support in old age and a son to light their funeral pyres.\n''The women here say they have so many children because there is no health care here,'' she says over tea, with guests sprawled on the floor in her small office. In India, family planning means sterilization, and in more than 90 percent of the cases, the operation is performed on women. Conditions are often unsanitary.\n''Women in this village say they do not want to be sterilized after two children, boys or girls, because the nearest doctor is far away and the services there are not very good,'' she says. ''So they ask: 'What happens if one of the babies falls sick and dies? Or what if I become ill after the operation? Who will look after me?' ''\nIn Naul, a village east of Tilonia, another high-caste woman, Ratan, is also trying to promote family planning. Married off at puberty to an older man, she was widowed while still in her teens. Her parents then took the bold step of allowing her to reject another marriage, and she began doing community work, using a knowledge of traditional medicine learned from her husband.\nTold about community work being done in rural Bangladesh, where villagers are trained in nutrition, Mrs. Ratan said most families here live on flat breads and lentils, and teaching them to prepare balanced diets would be meaningless, she explained, since there are almost no vegetables or fruits. In Jaipur, Fading Glory Of the Raj and Nature\nWhen the Rajasthani capital of Jaipur was built by the Maharajah Sawai Jai Singh of Amber in the mid-18th century, it was an Asian wonder. There were broad avenues drawn on a grid, shady colonnaded walkways along wide pavements, and a unity of architecture in private, public and commercial buildings. There was a drainage system.\nIn 250 years, Jaipur, a city built to serve 500,000 people, has become home to 1.5 or 2 million - no one really knows - and its glory has all but disappeared behind the huts of squatters and sidewalk vendors.\nAs the population continues to expand with the influx of people from the countryside, who erect small houses on the desert around the city's perimeter, its services have been severely strained. Roads are potholed; its once-famous drainage pipes clogged.\nThe destruction of Jaipur's natural environment has also been rapid and drastic, says Professor G. S. Nathawat of the Indira Gandhi Center for Ecological, Environmental and Population Studies at Rajasthan University. He takes a visitor to hills near the campus to see the latest phase in the city's deterioration.\nThere, forests are being razed and quarries dug to provide the booming construction industry with granite. The hills are protected woodlands and the quarrying illegal. But the business is so profitable that local officials can be bribed to make exceptions.\nOnly one small part of the forest backdrop remains, a section that university students have claimed and fenced. It is the last piece of recreation land left to them in Jaipur's once-wooded hills."}, {"text": "India Trade Dispute Brings Austerity to Nepal\n1989-05-25T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Nepalese Government, digging in for a long siege in a trade war with India that is being seen here as a test of Nepalese sovereignty, has introduced austerity measures and started reordering its development plans, officials here say.\nSince India closed all but two border crossings two months ago, ostentatious living has been forbidden in the Hindu kingdom, where most of the 18 million people are poor. Social gatherings, including wedding receptions, are being monitored, officials of the Government of King Birendra said in interviews.\nAt their most optimistic, Nepalese officials and business leaders say they will make the most of a cutoff of Indian consumer goods by encouraging local industries to fill the vacuum. New sources of imports and markets for exports are being sought. But some local business leaders and diplomats say serious problems are developing.\nIndia, through which most of landlocked Nepal's imports and exports pass, closed 19 of the 21 border crossings on March 23, and a week later allowed petroleum products agreements to lapse, depriving Nepal of fuel.\nAt the root of the dispute is Nepal's insistence on two treaties, one for trade and one for transit rights. India wants one, as it had before 1978. As the dispute drags on, diplomats here say, it becomes more apparent that Katmandu wants to review all its relations with New Delhi, embodied in a 1950 treaty now described as ''colonial.''\nTo the surprise of some diplomats, the Nepalese, most of whom cannot afford imported luxuries, appear to have closed ranks behind King Birendra's Government. Officials are reported to have concluded that the dispute with New Delhi will probably not be resolved until after India's elections, expected near the end of this year.\nA good harvest of wheat and mustard seed, from which edible oil is made, has reduced fears of a serious food shortage. Medicines are being flown in from Bangladesh, the Government spokesman, Radhe Shyam Bista, said. Black-market trading is also going on along the India-Nepal border.\nRoyal Nepal Airlines has been able to fly in enough fuel from Dhaka to restore all domestic air links and sustain international routes, Mr. Bista said. But taxis and private cars have been made idle by shortages, causing tourism's biggest problem, and a number of restautants have closed.\nOn the surface, daily life in the Katmandu Valley appears to be continuing without serious interruption, with limited diesel and gasoline supplies arriving from China or Singapore. India is allowing transit of essential goods.\nBut business leaders and diplomats suggest a ''hidden crisis'' is developing as Government and private projects wind down and the poorest day laborers lose jobs. Tourism has also been affected. May and June are traditionally the month when Indian tourists fill hotels vacated by Westerners.\nGovernment departments have been ordered to stop buying furniture, vehicles and land. Foreign visits and official receptions are being curtailed and the use of cars restricted.\nThe behavior of ''dignitaries and distinguished persons'' will be watched to determine whether they are obeying a recently enacted Social Reform Act forbidding lavish entertaining and other unneccessary expense.\nOfficials say a program for greater self-sufficiency in essential goods will be introduced. Large-scale development projects will also be reviewed."}, {"text": "Fast of Ramadan Ends With Feasts\n1989-05-03T05:00:00.000Z\nFast of Ramadan Is Soon to Be a Feast\nTOMORROW evening Muslims will search the night sky for the new moon. If they see the first sliver of light or hear of its official sighting in Mecca, they will end their monthlong fast at daybreak and eat heartily in celebration.\nSince April 6, the beginning of Ramadan, the holiest month of the Muslim calendar, millions of devout Muslims around the world have abstained from all foods and liquids from the first light of morning to sundown.\nThe morning after the new moon reappears - either Friday or Saturday - Muslims will begin the month of Shawwal and celebrate the id al-fitr, or festival of fast breaking. It is a day of thanksgiving, when they will dress up, exchange gifts, visit friends and eat.\nIn the observance of the fast, Ramadan is like the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur and the Christian period of Lent. Muslims believe that God revealed the Koran to Mohammed during this month in the seventh century.\nRamadan is more than a time of fasting. It is a time of restraint and reflection, of prayer and peace. It is a time of kindness and charity, of family and community.\nIt is also a time when food takes on a greater significance. ''That which we deny ourselves is more appreciated,'' said Ahmed Almontaser, a Muslim who owns the Moroccan Star Restaurant in downtown Brooklyn.\nAs the sun sets each evening during Ramadan, Muslims often join to break their fast with dates and water, as the prophet Mohammed is said to have done. Then facing Mecca and bowing on their knees with their heads to the ground, they make their sunset prayer.\nAfterward they have the iftar, or evening breakfast. The foods are simple and hearty: soups and stews made from lamb, chicken or beef to keep up strength during the fast.\nOn a recent Sunday about 400 Muslims - with backgrounds as diverse as Afghan, Egyptian, African-American, Palestinian, Pakistani, Spanish and Bangladeshi - gathered in Brooklyn for a community iftar at Masjid Al Farouq, a mosque on Atlantic Avenue between Fourth and Fifth Streets. They represented 17 Islamic centers in the New York region. Sneakers, work boots and oxfords were strewn in piles in the hallways, because Muslims must remove their footwear upon entering a mosque.\nThe men - some in business suits, others in loose tunics - covered their heads with turbans and woven caps. They prayed and broke their fast upstairs. The women, wearing ankle-length cloaks and scarfs concealing their hair, prayed and ate downstairs.\nShortly after a meal of lamb stew and Egyptian bread, they said their nighttime prayer, followed by a special prayer for forgiveness said only during Ramadan. Then they went home to sleep, where by custom they would rouse themselves at 3:30 or 4 A.M. to eat a light snack of fruit or yogurt, or even bagels and lox, to tide them over for more than 16 hours of fasting.\nFor Osama Younis, an Egyptian-born orthodontist, his wife, Mona, and their three children, each day of Ramadan begins with the predawn breakfast and a visit to their mosque in Mount Vernon, N.Y., for early prayers. Afterward, they return home to read a chapter of the Koran and then slip back into their beds for an hour's nap before beginning the workday or school day.\n''It is not difficult,'' Dr. Younis said. ''Allah gives us strength.''\nFasting during Ramadan is required of all adult Muslims, and children are encouraged to fast as much as they can. Pregnant women or those who are sick or engaged in hard labor may postpone their fast, fulfilling it when it is less a hardship.\n''Non-Muslims always ask why do we stay hungry all day,'' said Abdul-Salam Hamid, who came to New York from Pakistan 20 years ago. ''Half of the world is hungry. Many are dying of hunger. In this way we can feel their pain, understand their suffering and become more compassionate, more giving. Allah wants us to recognize this, to do good deeds and to learn how to control our temptations.''\nMr. Hamid, who owns Shaheem Sweets, a bakery and restaurant chain with four stores in Queens, Manhattan and Brooklyn, admitted that he sometimes absent-mindedly took a taste of his pastry. But according to Muslim law, an unintentional bite does not break the fast.\nDuring the last days of Ramadan, Muslims often sleep in the mosque, making intensive devotions. They await the Night of Power, which commemorates the first revelation of the Koran and a time when the faithful believe God will answer all prayers. Before feasting this week, each family must give food or money to help feed the poor.\nThere are more than five million Muslims in the United States, according to the Federation of Islamic Associations in Detroit. Because Islam brings together a multitude of traditions and cultures, there is no distinctive Islamic cuisine; there are no symbolic foods, except dates, that all Muslims eat in breaking their fast.\n''While Muslims who are from the Middle East eat baba gannouj - mashed eggplant in sesame butter - and falafel, we'll have fried chicken and potato salad,'' said Njeri Abdul-Mumit, an American-born Muslim who lives in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.\nBut there are some similarities among the foods that many Muslims eat. Alcohol and pork are forbidden. All meat must be halal (that is, from animals ritually slaughtered). Dried fruits are very common, and sweets of all types are savored.\nMuslims of Pakistani and Indian descent often make a special sweet pudding called sevian to begin their feast and to give to friends. Middle Easterners favor honey and nut-filled pastries like baklava and kinafa.\nSweets symbolize the joy Muslims feel after receiving God's blessings during Ramadan, Mr. Hamid said. And for him, the festival of fast breaking is a double celebration: ''It is my bakeries' busiest day.''

Moreover, the Soviets have promised to allow the author to read and approve the translation before its publication this year.\nThe book is ''Stalin in October: The Man Who Missed the Revolution,'' by Robert M. Slusser, a professor of history emeritus at Michigan State University. It describes Stalin's return from Siberian exile to Petrograd in March 1917 and his editorship of the party publication Pravda during the months leading up to the Bolshevik Revolution the following November. Professor Slusser writes that on the night of the revolution, Stalin stayed in the offices of Pravda rather than taking to the streets to join in the storming of the Winter Palace. Later, of course, Stalin had the history of the revolution rewritten in favor of a more laudatory version of his activities.\nJ. G. Goellner, director of the Johns Hopkins University Press, said Progress Publishers, the Soviet publishing house, was reluctant to buy Mr. Slusser's biography in 1987, because it did not think it could get clearance for the project. But after the policies of Mikhail S. Gorbachev encouraged more openness, Aleksandr Avelichev, the head of the publishing house, sent Johns Hopkins an offer. That contract was eventually signed in Boston.\nDuring the Frankfurt Book Fair last October, Mr. Avelichev asked to renegotiate the contract to increase the print run to as many as 200,000 copies. Mr. Goellner said that when he expressed surprise at so large an order, Mr. Avelichev replied: ''I don't think you understand what a big event this is going to be. We have nothing on Stalin in this country except what Stalin wanted written. This will open the door through which our own historians can now walk.'' Titles That Scan\nAlex Shoumatoff has written eight books of nonfiction, ranging from his search for his Russian roots to accounts of his travels in many lands. His most recent book, ''African Madness'' (Knopf), consists of four articles, revised from their original appearances in The New Yorker and Vanity Fair, on Madagascar, Dian Fossey, AIDS in Africa and the trial of Jean-Bedel Bokassa, the former ruler of the Central African Republic.\nWhile writing, Mr. Shoumatoff uses working titles that are often vastly different from the published titles, although he stayed with ''African Madness'' for this book.\n''It came to me as a sound more than as a meaning, although I thought there was enough meaning for a good title,'' Mr. Shoumatoff said. ''But from its cadence, you know it's probably by the same guy who wrote 'Russian Blood,' 'Florida Ramble' and 'The Rivers Amazon,' '' three of his previous books.\nThe working title for ''Russian Blood,'' Mr. Shoumatoff said, was -what else? - ''Rootski.'' For ''Westchester: Portrait of a County,'' he used ''Beyond the Bronx.'' And his book on the Amazon, published by Sierra Club Books, was ''The Big Amazon.'' When his editor suggested ''The Rivers Amazon,'' Mr. Shoumatoff was dubious. He said, ''I thought, sure, by the man who brought you 'The Brothers Karamazov.' ''\nYet even the most carefully considered titles are not always as distinctive as authors might like. Shortly after publication in 1986 of his book ''In Southern Light,'' based on his travels in Zaire and along the Amazon, Mr. Shoumatoff asked at a store in Manhattan whether it carried the book. The clerk said yes, and directed him to ''Southern Light,'' a fictional interpretation of the story of Genesis by J. R. Salamanca. When Mr. Shoumatoff tried again, he was directed to the travel section. ''I thought, that's more like it,'' he said, ''until I saw 'South Light,' by Michael Parfit, a book about the Antarctic.''\n''One of these days,'' Mr. Shoumatoff said, ''I'm going to invite those other two authors for a drink at the Algonquin and propose that we publish all three books in one bound edition.'' Profits to the Poor\nDominique Lapierre's book ''The City of Joy'' (Doubleday) is about the impoverished people of Calcutta, India, to whom the author promised 50 percent of the royalties. Since its publication three years ago, the book has sold about five million copies worldwide and Mr. Lapierre said it had earned the poor about $1 million - along with much more from the donations that accompanied many of the 70,000 letters from readers.\nThat money, Mr. Lapierre says, has been used to finance a number of projects in whole or in part: a home, schools and a training center for 150 children of lepers; three rehabilitation centers for lepers; three homes for 125 physically and mentally handicapped children from the slums; a medical dispensary in Bhangar, an area south of Calcutta in which as many as 700 patients are treated each day; a mobile medical dispensary in a remote area of the Ganges delta, and a home and school for 75 orphan children from an area near Bangladesh.\nMr. Lapierre and his wife, who also donated solar energy water pumps to 10 drought-afflicted villages in India, were recently made honorary citizens of Calcutta."}, {"text": "A Far-Flung Corporate Empire\n1989-07-12T05:00:00.000Z\nB.A.T. Industries, the target of Sir James Goldsmith's $21 billion takeover bid, is one of the most far-flung international corporations, selling insurance in Australia and the United States, producing paper pulp in India and Portugal, and processing tobacco in Zimbabwe and Zaire. Its shares, which are traded in New York as well as London, are widely held by individuals and institutions that specialize in assembling global portfolios.\nAlthough B.A.T. itself is not a household name in the United States, many of its subsidiaries and their products are. The company sells Kool and Barclay cigarettes, owns the Marshall Field's and Saks Fifth Avenue department store chains and offers insurance policies through the Farmers Group. It also produces NCR Paper and other carbonless paper products and has a 40 percent stake in Imasco, the Canadian consumer products company that owns the Hardee's fast-food chain and Peoples Drug Stores. Little Fat at Headquarters\nSuch diversity is what attracted the attention of Sir James and his partners, who describe the London-based company as a conglomerate whose parts are worth more than the whole. Analysts agree that the company has many highly independent operating units that could readily be sold to pay the debt Sir James would pile up in the proposed acquisition, but they also say that B.A.T. has a lean corporate structure from which little fat could be cut.\nThe company employs only 100 people at its London headquarters and another 100 at the Louisville, Ky., headquarters of Batus Inc., its holding company for United States subsidiaries. That might limit the profits to be gained in breaking up B.A.T.\n''B.A.T.'s managers are excellent, and it is unlikely that Sir James could find anyone better,'' said Roy D. Burry, who follows the company for Kidder, Peabody & Company in New York.\nMany analysts count the most likely casualty in any takeover, Patrick Sheehy, B.A.T.'s chairman, as one of the company's chief assets. A veteran of the British Army who fought his way up the corporate ladder through appointments in Nigeria, Ghana, Ethiopia and the Caribbean, Mr. Sheehy has a record that analysts say demonstrates both toughness and competence.\n''He has got his hands on the helm, and we think he knows where he wants to go,'' said Paul Himmelheber, vice president of Himelheber Investment Research, a Philadelphia stock research firm. Highly Decentralized Structure\nUnder Mr. Sheehy, B.A.T. has evolved a highly decentralized structure, emphasizing four main business lines: tobacco, insurance, paper and retailing. Operations within these businesses are run independently enough that dismemberment could be relatively easy. ''It's not just the big four pieces,'' Mr. Burry said. ''There are pieces within the pieces you can break off.''\nB.A.T. started out as the British-American Tobacco Company, which was created in 1902 by an agreement among international tobacco barons to divide the world market. James Buchanan Duke, founder of the American Trust Company, agreed with the Imperial Tobacco Company, which had a near monopoly in the British market, that each concern would sell tobacco products only in its home country. British-American Tobacco, with the Duke family as its majority shareholder, was created to sell cigarettes throughout Britain's colonies and protectorates.\nDespite aggressive diversification efforts, the cigarette business still accounts for two-fifths of B.A.T.'s sales and nearly half its profits. B.A.T. owns the Louisville-based Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, the nation's third-largest tobacco company and the maker of such cigarette brands as Capri, Kool, Barclay, Viceroy and Raleigh. B.A.T. also has full or majority ownership of tobacco companies in 38 countries, ranging from Switzerland and the Netherlands to Nicaragua, Suriname and Bangladesh. A Shade Smaller Than Texaco\nWith $31 billion in sales and $1.7 billion in pretax profits last year, B.A.T. is only a shade smaller than Texaco Inc. or the Du Pont Company. Only nine American industrial concerns are larger.\nThe company's diversification campaign began in earnest during the 1970's, when B.A.T. began using the huge cash flow from its tobacco operations to buy retailing and paper-making companies. The results from these acquisitions were decidedly mixed, analysts say.\nThe subsidiaries that have given B.A.T. the most trouble have been retailers. It sold three of its department store chains - Kohl's, Crescent and Frederick & Nelson - in 1986. The company also failed in its efforts to rebuild Gimbels, which was dismantled in a series of asset sales. About 5,000 employees were thrown out of work by the moves. Shift to Insurance in 1982\nMarshall Field's and Saks, which showed poor fashion judgment in the mid-1980's, were also disappointments. But with help from B.A.T. to invest in sprucing up their stores, both chains are now doing well, Mr. Burry said.\nMr. Sheehy shifted diversification targets after taking over in 1982, replacing retailers with insurance companies. B.A.T. paid $1.4 billion in January 1984 for Eagle Star Holdings P.L.C., a leading British company with strong sales of life insurance policies, after Eagle Star became the target of a hostile bid from Allianz Versicherungs A.G. Germany's largest insurer. Last December, Batus, which accounted for 30 percent of B.A.T.'s sales last year, completed a $5.2 billion hostile takeover of Farmers Group Inc., a Los Angeles-based company that is the third-largest home and auto insurer in the United States.\nBoth acquisitions have generally done well under B.A.T.'s management, analysts say, with B.A.T. successfully retaining the senior Farmers management that has made the company among the more profitable in the industry. Eagle Star has had poor results only in the United States. Loss on Eagle Star Unit\nB.A.T. disposed of Eagle Star of America in late 1986 for $34.5 million, after pouring in nearly $39 million to shore up the subsidiary's inadequate reserves.\nIn testimony last year at California Insurance Department hearings into the Farmers acquisition, a senior B.A.T. official blamed bad management in the early 1980's for Eagle Star of America's poor performance.\nThe spectacle of B.A.T. as a takeover target provoked comments yesterday that the poacher of companies was in danger of being poached itself. But with the exception of a bitter eight-month battle last year to take control of Farmers Group, B.A.T. has pursued almost exclusively friendly takeover bids."}, {"text": "FILM; Satyajit Ray Gives Ibsen A Bengali Spin\n1989-05-07T05:00:00.000Z\nSatyajit Ray, Sidelined for more than half a decade by heart disease, is about to return to the cinema world with his 26th feature film - and first screen adaptation of a play, Henrik Ibsen's ''Enemy of the People.''\nThe film will have its premiere at the Cannes Festival, which begins on Thursday. Called ''Ganashatru'' in Bengali, the picture has already been picked up by distributors in Britain and France.\nIt won't open here in Calcutta till next fall, however, because the 67-year-old Mr. Ray, always the perfectionist, doesn't want to subject it to the city's un-air-conditioned theaters during the suffocating summer. ''They keep the fans whirring all the time,'' he said. ''It ruins the soundtrack.''\n''Why I chose a play for the first time in my career,'' Mr. Ray explained, relaxing in his Calcutta apartment on a warm Bengali night, ''was that for five years I hadn't made a film because of illness. Then the doctors suggested that I could go back to making films provided I worked only in the studio, not on locations.\n''If it had to be confined within the studio, then I started thinking of a play,'' he said. ''I had read Ibsen as a young man in college, and 'Enemy of the People' I remembered. I read him again. It seems the play could be brought up to date, transplanted to Bengal and turned into a completely Indian story, relevant to modern times.\n''So I decided on Ibsen, and we got going,'' he said. ''I wrote a screenplay. I adapted it. Three or four writings, and there it was, ready to be filmed.''\n''An Enemy of the People,'' a five-act play Ibsen wrote in 1882, tells the story of Thomas Stockmann, a doctor in a Norwegian resort who falls afoul of vested interest when he tries to sound a warning that the town's mineral baths have been polluted by industrial wastes. Seeing their local prosperity threatened, even liberals turn against him, seeking to suppress his scientific report. He is hounded into isolation, a man of principle who has become an enemy of the people.\nThe play was thought to be Ibsen's sharp retort to Norwegian society's negative response to his previous play, ''Ghosts.'' ''An Enemy of the People'' portrays a hypocritical middle class, easily persuaded to trade in their idealism for security.\nMr. Ray, who casts the man he calls ''my favorite actor,'' Soumitra Chatterji, as his Dr. Gupta, the Bengali Stockmann, said the shooting of the film went very well and that his health seemed to improve in the process. The director comes close to being worshiped by Calcuttans, who save their highest regard for artists. In a city where people will pay for tape of Mr. Ray's voice, his health is a matter of great local concern.\nDressed in the white cotton shirt and trousers Bengalis call ''Punjabi pajamas,'' Mr. Ray said he feels very close to Calcuttans and would not want to work anywhere else. Sounds of the city drifted through the large open windows as he talked in his huge, high-ceilinged study piled with papers and books. The elegant old apartment, a virtual film set for intellectual Calcutta life, has had to make only one concession to modernization: an elevator has been installed outside in the hall to save Mr. Ray, who has had coronary bypass surgery, a climb up several flights of stairs.\n''Everything was made inside the studio in Calcutta,'' he said of ''Ganashatru,'' a film about 100 minutes long. ''We had a 45-day schedule; we finished in 28 days. We worked incredibly fast, particularly because I had a wonderful set of actors. It was O.K. on the first take much of the time, so I didn't even have to take a second take or third take.\n''I had an ambulance and a doctor in attendance,'' he said. ''My cardiologist would occasionally drop in. My family physican would come. You see, they were interested because it was the story of a doctor. Apart from taking my blood pressure and pulse, they were interested in what was going on and how the doctor was behaving in the circumstances.\n''Their verdict was that I kept better when I was shooting,'' he said with a low laugh. ''The adrenaline, or whatever, caused an improvement in my health. They said that I should certainly be making one film a year, and that in the next film, I could even include a few outdoor scenes.''\nMr. Ray calls his version of ''An Enemy of the People'' ''a free adaptation of Ibsen. ''People will recognize Ibsen,'' he said. ''The debt to Ibsen is there. The five-act structure is there. But apart from that, I've had to make changes. You inevitably have to make changes. People behave differently, you see.'' Mr. Ray says he dealt with the staginess inherent in a dramatic work by pulling it farther and farther out from under the proscenium as he went along. This attempt to give the story a cinematic feel has wrought additional alterations in the Ibsen work.\n''The first act has a lot of words, a lot of entrances and exits,'' he said. ''But it's as cinematic as I could make it.\n''Gradually, more and more, as the story develops, it departs more and more from Ibsen and becomes more and more cinematic,'' he said. ''Particularly, the public meeting that takes place in the film is very, very unlike the scene in the play. It's very mobile and free: lots of camera movements, cuts and this and that and not a plethora of dialogue.''\nMr. Ray said he knew that the Ibsen play would have contemporary appeal in India as well as abroad, apart from its novelty as an Indian's view of a Scandinavian theatrical work.\n''It deals with topical problems,'' he said. ''Pollution is still a problem, as much as it was a hundred years ago - more than that, much more than that.'' Mr. Ray is optimistic that this timeliness of topics, among other attractionss - not the least beings his reputation - will help India's National Film Development Corporation, the production's backers, to market the film in the United States.\n''There is considerable interest abroad, partly because it's Ibsen,'' he said. ''And then, Arthur Miller had an adaptation of the Ibsen play, which has been playing in London recently and is doing very well. So I'm sure there's an additional reason for interest in this film.''\nLike this film, Mr. Ray's previous work, ''Ghare Baire'' (''Home and the World''), based on a story by Rabindranath Tagore, was also shown abroad before being screened in Calcutta. But Mr. Ray, who has an international stature not shared by most of the rest of India's directors - Bengali or otherwise - dismisses brusquely the contention of some Indians critics that his films are made for foreign audiences.\n''I always make my films primarily for my own audience,'' he said. ''I've never known what kind of film will export well. I have never been able to fathom what goes down well with the Western audience.\n''You know, I made a film once called 'The Music Room,' which I thought was so Indian, because it had lots of Indian classical singing and dancing and music and whatnot,'' he recalled. ''It deals with problems which are totally Indian. I thought that film would never export. But it did very well abroad, and now in France, it's my most popular film. It's considered to be one of the great films of all time.'' He laughed heartily. ''I just don't understand.'' ''My first film was a success in Calcutta, a big success in Calcutta, even before it won a prize in Cannes,'' he said of ''Pather Panchali,'' released in 1955. ''It's wrong that people say that my success abroad eventually gave me a footing here. That's not true.\n''I've always made films with an Indian audience in mind,'' he said. ''In fact, I've often had great difficulties in translating the dialogues, because they were so Indian, and so Bengali. So if I had thought of the Western audience first, then I certainly would have thought of different films.''\nMr. Ray said his deep attachment to the state of Bengal has led him to reject foreign film-making offers all of his life.\n''I could have made films in Hollywood,'' he said.''I've had offers, many offers, which I turned down, because I don't have my roots there. I want my roots to be in the place where I work. I'm deeply rooted here, and I'm only interested in Indian subjects.''\nThe director acknowledges that with a relatively small - by Indian standards - Bengali market, and with a ban on Indian films in neighboring, Bengali-speaking Bangladesh, he has been grateful for his success abroad.\n''The international market helps me to survive as a film maker,'' he said. ''There's no question about it, because I have a small market in India. That is to say, it's a Bengali-speaking audience primarily. Now, of late, I have started putting in English subtitles for Bombay, Delhi and Madras, but that still is a small market.''\nSatyajit Ray has won dozens of prizes. This year, President Francois Mitterrand of France came to Calcutta to present him with the Medal of the Legion of Honor. But Mr. Ray has never won an Oscar.\n''I've won almost every other kind of prize, except the Oscar,'' he said, reflectively. ''But you see, my films have never been entered for the Academy Awards. I have no agents in America, and it's just not happened. But I'm quite happy with what I have.''"}, {"text": "Excerpts From the News Conference Given by Bush in Paris\n1989-07-17T05:00:00.000Z\nFollowing are excerpts from President Bush's news conference in Paris yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times: OPENING STATEMENT\nWell, we've just concluded two and a half days of intensive and productive meetings with the summit counterparts on economic and political issues.\nAnd let me take this opportunity first of all to thank President Mitterrand for his most gracious hospitality.\nThe summit, in my view, was a clear success. We met in a time of sustained economic growth and agreed that the prospects are good for the continued expansion without inflation of that growth. It was against this backdrop that we conducted a wide-ranging discussion on critical global issues, from East-West relations to the growing environmental challenge that we face.\nWe came to Paris at a truly remarkable moment. The winds of change are bringing hope to people all around the world. And who would have thought just a few short years ago that we would be witness to a freely elected Senate in Poland or political pluralism in Hungary.\nI was really touched by what I saw and heard in those two countries - people determined to keep their dreams alive, people determined to see a Europe whole and free. Backing Hungarians and Poles\nAnd that's why America brought to this summit our determination to support the reform movement in Hungary and Poland. People yearning for freedom and democracy deserve our support. And it's because of the community of values shared by these summit countries that we were able to agree to meet soon to discuss concerted action that'll help Poland and Hungary.\nDemocracy and economic growth go hand in hand, whether in Eastern Europe, the Summit Seven, or the developing world. And, therefore, much of our discussion here in Paris centered on economics. We reaffirmed our international economic cooperation and our whole policy coordination process.\nOur strength and debt strategy was firmly supported. We reaffirmed our determination to maintain and improve the multilateral trading system, calling for the completion of the Uruguay Round by the end of 1990 and extending the GATT to new areas, including agriculture.\nThis summit marked a watershed on the environment. And we agreed that decisive action is urgently needed to preserve the Earth. We committed to work together as well as with the developing world to meet our responsibility of global stewardship. 1990 Meeting in U.S.\nThe measures we've agreed to in Paris are timely and they lay the groundwork for further specific steps when we meet again next year in the United States.\nAnd, finally, I was especially pleased to find that my colleagues share our sense of urgency and sense of the importance of the worldwide fight against drugs. Among other steps, we agreed to establish a financial action task force to find new ways to track and prevent the laundering of drug money.\nI look forward to meeting my summit colleagues in the United States next year as we continue working on these and other priority issues, build on the progress that we made -genuine progress that I think was made here in Paris.\nAnd I might say that I was very pleased that this meeting coincided with the bicentennial here. It was a very moving experience for all of us. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Gorbachev's Offer Now I will be glad to take any questions. Helen.\nQ. Mr. President, . . . Mr. Gorbachev wants to play a part in the world economic discussions. Would he be welcome at the next economic summit table?\nA. Well, I think that's a little premature. But it was very interesting, I found, that a leader of the Soviet Union would address a letter to the French President as head of this year's summit. We talked about that letter a great deal. There's an awful lot that has to transpire in the Soviet Union, it seems to me, before anything of that nature would be considered.\nWe're talking about free market economies here. And, but - I found fascinating the very fact of the letter. But there was no -there certainly - I don't think any indication that the next - that he will be attending the next summit. He'll get a very courteous and very thoughtful reply from Mr. Mitterrand. Role of Small Nations\nQ. How about the . . . countries - Bangladesh - would they ever be welcome?\nA. Well, this is an economic summit of countries whose economies were drawn together by the free economies of the West. And so I don't think there's a question at this point of expanding the summit. There is concern about the economies in the world that aren't doing so well.\nNow Bangladesh is a country that does need aid and, indeed, the communique addressed itself to trying to help Bangladesh. Yeah. Wait a minute, excuse me, Terry, and then go.\nQ. Mr. President, you've consulted with the NATO allies on military matters in Brussels, and then you've had an economic summit here in Paris. What's left before you sit down with Mr. Gorbachev for a superpower summit?\nA. A little more time, I think.\nQ. Don't you have anything to discuss with him now that you've got all this groundwork laid?\nA. Oh sure. Let me explain to those who aren't familiar with the policy that Secretary Baker had met a couple of times with Mr. Shevardnadze. There will be another such meeting of that nature. And at an appropriate time, I will have a meeting with Mr. Gorbachev. But I don't think anything at the summit influences a bilateral - that bilateral meeting. Criticism on Environment\nQ. Mr. President, the summit calls for decisive action on the environment, but various environmental groups are saying that you did not take decisive action. Could you respond to that?\nA. Well, I did see some one or two groups. They didn't think I took decisive action when I sent up - or took proper action when I sent a very far-reaching clean air proposal up to the Congress. And so some have been critical.\nMany have been supportive on the broad -the very fact - I'll tell you where we got a lot of support is the very fact that the communique addressed itself with some specificity to various environmental goals. The whole concept of cooperation on research technology and transfer to the L.D.C.'s; the prevention of pollution; the idea of setting up monitoring stations so we can better predict and thus avoid environmental disaster.\nThere were - there was a lot of common ground - in fact, I would say that on that and perhaps anti-narcotic, there was most fervor. And so I think many environmental groups see the very fact that this matter was on the front burner as being very positive. And the summit did take - make strong enough statements to commit all of our members and hopefully others around the world to sound environmental practice. Poland and Hungary\nQ. Mr. President, you promised in Poland and Hungary that you would seek concerted action on the part of the countries meeting here to help those countries. Now there seems to have been a pledge that there would be concerted consideration of actions - no dollar figure attached and no specified action promised - and a meeting apparently planned. Do you feel you got what you wanted, sir?\nA. I think so. And you'll notice, Brit, that in both Poland and Hungary I stopped well short of setting dollar figures or challenging others to meet dollar figures. But on this one let there be no doubt there was unanimity that we should address ourselves to the problems of Poland and Hungary, and so I was not disappointed. I didn't go in there with a specific package of - with dollar figures on it. And I think an early meeting to do just that is good.\nIt called for food aid to Poland; that's specific. It doesn't have a figure on it, but - no, I think we got what we sought. And there was no rancor on that question, and no division on the question. But there was unanimity that we have to move on it. Yeah, Owen. Reaction to Gorbachev\nQ. . . .What is an appropriate response from the West to such an extraordinary request by Mr. Gorbachev to become part of the economy of the Western democracies?\nA. We would welcome any movement by the Soviet Union towards market-oriented or Western economies. There's no question about that. And there's nothing begrudging about our saying - in replying to Helen's comment - in my replying to Helen's that I don't expect Mr. Gorbachev to sit as a member of the - at next year's summit. But the discussion was - it started off by, What do you think he means by this? And a lot of discussion - we'll get the experts to analyze it. And all of that took place. And people concluded that it was just one more manifestation of the changing world we're living in. And that, I think, was the main message. And then where we go from here, his -some of that has been addressed in the communique, because we talked in there about help for the third world. And some of his letter, as you know, was on that very subject. So it was - when it came in, Mr. Mitterrand read it off to the group there and then said, Well, what will we do? And my suggestion was - which he had intended to adopt anyway - that he, as the man to whom the letter was addressed, would reply to it.\nSo that's the way it was. And the fact that it's happening, taking place. The President of the United States can go to Eastern Europe and witness the very kind of change we're talking about.\nI'll tell you - I want to get to the reply to Carl's question here - but the most, almost the most dramatic for me was when Mr. Nemeth, the Prime Minister of Hungary, handed me that piece of barbed wire, tearing down the Iron Curtain between Hungary and Austria. Now who would have thought that possible? And this letter, just one more manifestation of the exciting times we're in, of change. They're moving toward our open system, our free system, our system of free election. And that's the way I would look at the letter in that context. Carl. A Summit in Texas?\nQ. Mr. President, in connection with next year's summit, there's been some talk among some of your people about possibly having it in your own state of Texas, possibly in San Antonio. And I wondered whether you'd like to see that?\nA. Well, I'd have to run that by The Dallas Morning News and see how they felt about it. But that's a distinct possibility. However, it's too early; no decision has been made. The fact that Jim Baker's from Houston and I'm from Houston and Bob Mosbacher's from Texas should have nothing to do with where the next summit's going to be. And there has been no decision.\nQ. That wouldn't mean some discrimination against Dallas because of your roots?\nA. No, none whatsoever. Get that down: The fall elections are up in 199 - ummm. Charles. Style of the Summit\nQ. Let me follow on the question about the summit. These things have gotten a lot bigger than they were originally planned to be. Hundreds of your people, thousands of us. It's your first summit, but you've got to host the next one. Have you given any thought to how you want to do it in terms of style?\nA. No. But I'll tell you the part - and I'm the new boy, the new kid in school - but the part I found most interesting was the unstructured part, the part where you sit with these other leaders, tell them what you think, listen carefully to what they think. And that happened sometimes in the corridors or sometimes before a structured seminar, sometimes at a meal. And I would like to think that the more emphasis we placed on that kind of interaction, the better it would be.\nBut there was no discussion by the Soviet - the summit interlocutors on how to restructure it. Indeed, it went smoothly. And that - I will again say that Mr. Mitterrand handled the formal part very well. But for me, I'd like to see more just plain unstructured interaction between the leaders where you don't just have to talk on the agenda items. Yeah, yeah, John. Money for Space\nQ. It'll be 20 years ago next Thursday that man first landed on the Moon. . . . your Administration . . . to announce on Thursday we're going to go back to the Moon, possibly even to Mars. Can you and Dick Darman find that kind of money in the budget?\nA. Well, you put your finger, John, on some of the real problems - the major problem -on setting major goals for space, space exploration. And whether we will be ready by next week and - or later this week to make any momentous announcements, I'm not sure. I have not made a decision on what we will say on that historic day.\nQ. Wouldn't it be cheaper if you went in with the Soviets on it, though?\nA. Well, that has been suggested. But -and some, as you know, some discussions have gone on, not, I don't think, recently between us and the Soviets on this. But certainly the concept of international is not offensive to me. But we'll have to wait and see, because no decision - we're going to go right across and work our way back down here. Weakening of Economy\nQ. Mr. President, Friday's economic indicators showed some weakening of the U.S. economy. Apparently some of your summit partners expressed some concern about that. What assurance did you give them - and can you give us - that we're not headed for a recession?\nA. Well, you know, ironically, none did express to me their concern about the U.S. economy stalling out. We really didn't get into that discussion. I must say that from time to time it is a matter of concern to me, and thus I've tried to think through with our Secretary of the Treasury and others the concept of how the interest rate structure should be. But I've had no indication from home, nor have we picked up any here, that they felt that the U.S. economy was going to move towards a recession. And that's the thing, of course, that you'd want to guard against.\nOur growth has not been as robust as the growth in some other countries, but it -we're still moving. And when you have a several trillion dollar gross national product, you take a small percentage of growth and it makes for enormous dollar figures in growth. The Soviet Economy\nQ. Mr. President, how much change would the Soviet Union have to make before they could earn an invitation to next year's economic summit? And if you can't answer that specifically, at least could you give us some sense of scale?\nA. Well, one, as you know, I have welcomed the reforms that are taking place in the Soviet Union. But I don't - this concept of the Soviets coming to a G Seven summit has never been, to my knowledge, thought much about until this letter appeared, so there's no standards for entrance into the G Seven.\nThe Soviet economy needs a lot of work. And I say that not to be critical, but certainly that's an objective judgment. The economy is in bad, bad shape. Far worse shape than the, oh, Western economies. And so I think what we ought to do is to encourage the kinds of economic changes in Eastern Europe and, to the degree the Soviet would not consider that an intervention into their internal affairs, in the Soviet Union. And that - those should be the next steps. Welcome the - welcome the interest that was shown by this letter. This wasn't an application for admission to the G Seven; it was saying let's do something in a common way about solving problems around the world. Europe's Future\nQ. Mr. President, you've talked about a whole and united Europe, and Mr. Gorbachev has talked about a common European home. Are they the same concepts, or what is the difference? Is there a difference between the role of the U.S. in those two statements?\nA. Europe whole and free is our concept. His common European home is fine so long as, as I've said earlier, you can move from room to room. And that means a - coming along further on human rights; that means much more openness. It means support them when you see the move toward perestroika and glasnost.\nBut it means an evolution in the Soviet Union. And it means an evolution in Eastern Europe. And we've begun to see it. A Europe whole and free does not visualize a Europe where you still have barbed wire separating some people. Or you still have human rights abuses in one or two of the countries that are egregious.\nAnd so it is whole and free, and the common home theme is a good one. I mean that's a very good theme, and we should encourage it. But we want to see these countries continue to move towards what works, and what works is freedom, democracy, market economy, things of that nature.\nQ. Mr. President, in the meeting of the G Seven, is there room or does - did you sense that the countries want U.S. leadership or they want the U.S. to be a coequal partner?\nA. You mean with the Soviets?\nQ. Yes.\nA. No, I sense that they - that those colleagues feel that we have disproportionate responsibility. I think there's a keen interest in how I will work with the Soviets. There's no question about that. I felt that very clearly. Serious Change in East\nQ. Mr. President, going back to the other day in Poland, an elderly man said that when people talk to you folks about change, just remember that the Communists still have the bayonet. So my question to you is, do you believe that countries like Poland and Hungary are really going to have serious and permanent change, or is there a line that their leaders and that Moscow just won't go past?\nA. Well, no, I think that you've already seen serious change. I think you see the political situation in Hungary, for example, is absolutely amazing compared to the way we used to view Hungary. And if the Soviet Union, instead of taking their troops out of Hungary had tried to tighten down, I don't expect we'd see the kind of change in Hungary that we're seeing today.\nAnd so I'd say that we're a long way from what Gorbachev has spelled out as a common European home, but it's moving. So let's encourage the progress.\nQ. Mr. President,. . . there is a course that's going to lead to a permanent change or again the question is are the Soviets going to step in and pull the rug out from under it some day.\nA. Well, I would quote Mr. Gorbachev's words back to him on that when he told me in New York and what Jim Baker has heard from Shevardnadze and what everybody who interacts with the Soviets here. And that is that perestroika is for real; that you cannot set the clock back; it is going to go forward. And so I would see that as what guides now. However, I have said as long as there are enormous imbalances in conventional forces and in certain categories of strategic forces, the West should keep its eyes wide open. And indeed there was some reference to that in this communique. There was unanimity on the part of the NATO allies that we ought to be cautious and that we - and so to answer your question, it's not done - it's not a done deal. On the Cold War\nQ. As you put all of this together, what you said about Poland and Hungary and Gorbachev asking to join the world economy, as a matter of policy do you see the cold war as over, and do you think the West has won?\nA. I don't like to use, quote, cold war, unquote. That, that, that - there's a connotation, has a connotation of worse days in terms of East-West relationship. I think things have moved forward so that the connotation that those two words conjure up are - is entirely different now. And yet I don't want to stand here and seem euphoric that everything is hunky-dory between the East and the West on arms or on differences in economy or on how we look at regional problems. We have some big differences still.\nBut let's encourage the change, and then I can answer your question in a few more -maybe a few more years more definitively. Yes.\nQ. Mr. President, the summit seven leaders are celebrating a gathering that was so successful it went for two and a half days instead of three. Could you not find another half-day's worth of problems to discuss and maybe resolve, sir?\nA. We were kind of running out of gas. I'll tell, it's been a vigorous experience in physical fitness for me, and I try to stay in pretty good shape. But this one, when you couple the summit with the bicentennial and then tack on Poland and Hungary, I wasn't about to argue that we needed more time and - nor was anyone else. I think the fact that this rather complex agenda was completed in harmony is the fact that ought to really carry the spotlight, not the fact that we finished in advance. There's going to be plenty of opportunities to discuss a lot more problems that exist around the world. The Stealth Bomber\nQ. Mr. President, the Stealth bomber had a couple of setbacks this week. And Senator Nunn, as I understand it, indicated that he's not going to pay for a plane that just taxis. Do you have faith in this project or are you alarmed by the recent developments?\nA. Well, it's Senator Nunn and 250 million other Americans that pick up the bill for it. But if he's not going to pay for it, I mean, it's a, it's a decision that the Congress is going to have take collectively. If Senator decides it isn't a good idea, it's going to be a whale of a fight. But I think that legitimate questions have been raised about this - the bomber. And Secretary Cheney has addressed them very forcefully, giving the Administration's position.\nQ. Mr. President, you're giving away money to Poland and Hungary, and you're talking about spending more money on the environment and there are a lot of needs at home, and now you're in a new budget cycle. Is this the time - and you promised today to reduce the deficit, the U.S. budget deficit - is this the time to announce that it's necessary to raise taxes in the United States?\nA. No.\nQ. How are you going deal with that?\nA. Well, we've already got a proposal up on the Hill and look at it very carefully. And our director of the O.M.B. has done a very good job in sorting out priorities. He's worked -and our Cabinet has given him full cooperation. And the proposals that I have made can be and are included in our budget thinking, not just for this year but beyond. But you put your finger on something that does trouble me. When I come to countries like Poland and Hungary, I wish we did have more, more funds with which to help others, encourage private investment and public-private partnerships and privitization. I wish we had much more to do there or speedily apply to environmental concerns or anti-narcotics cooperation.\nSo I don't want to sound like we have it all made at all. We've had to sort through priorities in a very complicated way. But to answer your question, you have to go up to the question that was earlier asked about the economy itself. And I do not want to risk screeching growth, modest though it may be, to a halt by raising revenues in the way that some have suggested. Democracy and Economy\nQ. All through Eastern Europe you talked about two themes constantly. One, encouraging democracy and . . . market economy and, two, that you weren't there to try to raise tensions with the Soviet Union or challenge them in any way. But my question is, if what you want is carried out . . . democracy and market economy - aren't you really talking about the dissolution of the Soviet empire. And is that what you mean when you call for a Europe that's whole and free?\nA. The Soviet empire, if you mean the imposition of a Marxist system or socialism, in their definition, system on others, yes, I'd like to see Europe whole and free. And - but with the Soviet moving towards market - and they're not there - towards more freedom, towards more openness, they themselves have recognized that their system doesn't work. So you don't run the risks or have the same tensions that we might have had 10 years ago talking about the very same themes I talked about in Poland and Hungary. . . . And this is the last one. I've got to do it for the Houston guy.\nQ. Thank you. Is Mr. Mitterrand free to reply to the Gorbachev letter himself or will it be circulated or would you like to see the letter? How would you like to that to go -\nA. No. I think that he should reply to it himself. He has a good relationship with Mr. Gorbachev. Gorbachev was here; they've had some follow-up, I believe. And the letter was addressed to him, albeit as president of the summit.\nQ. Mr. President, did you, in this summit, achieve all your goals. Do you have the feeling of being the winner No. 1 of the summit?\nA. Well, I pointed out before we came over here that something of this nature ought not to be judged in terms of winners and losers.\nI am very satisfied that the summit achieved its goals. Every other summit leader tells me that it was the best summit they have attended. We're together as how we approach the East. We're together as how we approach the environmental question. I didn't take a question on third world debt, but there's a strong endorsement for the Brady plan. And there was dissension on that approach. So it came together, very, very well.\nMr. Brady - and I shouldn't say this; I know this is going to get me in real trouble -but if the Brady plan looks like it's going to be successful, we may call it the Bush plan. Thank you all very, very much."}, {"text": "SALMAN RUSHDIE: FICTION'S EMBATTLED INFIDEL\n1989-01-29T05:00:00.000Z\nBRICK LANE, IN LONDON'S EAST END, IS A neighborhood peopled by those whom the city never expected to accommodate. It is a neighborhood of Asians - as they are called by the English, who are comfortable still with the old colonial term that did not distinguish among the many peoples east of Europe. There are thought to be 40,000 Asians in Brick Lane, mostly Muslims from Bengal, a region cleaved in 1947 when India was partitioned and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) created. They have come for many reasons - exiles, refugees, schemers - and they have not always been welcomed. ''Asian'' suggests not only the distance the immigrants have traveled but also the distance at which they remain. And something more troubling, a sense of unease and estrangement, is suggested by newer, post-colonial terms: quotas, fourth world, National Front, Paki-bashing.\nI walked in Brick Lane one morning last November with the novelist Salman Rushdie. Rushdie, who is 41, was born in Bombay; he was sent to England to be schooled, and later chose to settle in London because London was where he could write the fiction he wanted to. In Bombay or in any other city in that part of the world, there wasn't the climate for the writer he wanted to be, not yet.\n''I wanted to write globe-swallowing, capacious books, ones with that sense of size, novels that expressed history, the public side of things as well as the private, the intimate,'' he had told me when I'd first met him, in New York, early last fall.\nAnd he did write such books. Two sweeping, stylistically dazzling novels - ''Midnight's Children'' and ''Shame'' - established his reputation in the early 1980's as one of the most important writers of his generation in England. Moreover, he is the only one among them - I am thinking of such writers as Martin Amis, Julian Barnes, Ian McEwan - whose books have traveled well. Rushdie, in the United States especially, is discussed in the company of our world storytellers: Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Milan Kundera, Gunter Grass.\nWhen I first met Rushdie, I had just finished reading his extraordinary new novel, ''The Satanic Verses,'' now making its way into American bookstores. (A review appears today in The Times Book Review.) The book may be understood as the third volume of an unintended trilogy, one in which a novelist named Salman Rushdie moves not only westward but inward, searching for yet another way to redescribe a world increasingly connected, but in no way whole.\nThe societal fissures that Rushdie examines in ''The Satanic Verses'' have been sharply, if strangely, mirrored in the book's reception. In England, it has attracted praise, award nominations (it won Britain's Whitbread prize as best novel), and many, many readers. In England, it has also been vilified and even burned at rallies by Islamic fundamentalists. The controversy - and it is not just England's controversy; the book has been banned in India, Egypt and Saudi Arabia - is about more than the book, of course. But like all controversies surrounding novels, it has reopened one of our great cultural questions: how and why does fiction mean so much?\nThe book's opening pages tell of an astonishing, fantastical immigration: Two middle-aged Indian actors, Gibreel Farishta and Saladin Chamcha, hurtle through cold thin air toward the English coast - singing, razzing each other, and already, like all immigrants, longing at once to remember and to forget. They have been blown out of a hijacked airliner, and miraculously, after a 29,000-foot free-fall, survive and make their ways to London. In episode after episode of the loose, shifting narrative that moves the novel forward and frames its many stories, they struggle to get a fix on London, and on themselves. They learn new ways of construing the world. They are mugged by ghosts - old lovers, old habits of mind and feeling. They return to the East, in jumbo jets and dreams, but never fully, never again. (An excerpt appears on page 48.)\nDeep, at times fathomless questions are plumbed: what is the nature of Good? Of Evil? Is Farishta an archangel? Chumcha Satan? Was their fall a contemporary version of The Fall? But the novel never strays too far or too long from London's streets: Rushdie's prose - the lustrous, alloyed English he's fused from street slang, Great Books, rock songs, ad jingles, immigrant patois, everything - has a way of keeping us in the crowded, gritty here and now, even in the book's most phantasmagoric pages. Farishta and Chumcha, and the Dickensian array of characters they encounter (or imagine), people what is ultimately the first major novel of the new England, an England with more than two million immigrants, one in which it is no longer clear, exactly, what ''English life'' comprises, what ''being English'' means.\nA good deal of the novel unfolds in a neighborhood called Brickhall - a neighborhood, Rushdie had told me, utilizing one of his favorite locutions, that ''is and is not'' Brick Lane. I had asked him when I'd met him in New York if he might show me around - Brick Lane is not a part of London a Western visitor sees - and he had agreed. But when I'd arrived in London and phoned him, I'd expected he would tell me he had changed his mind. In places like Brick Lane now, there were individuals vowing to kill him.\nEARLY IN OCTOBER, ''THE SATANIC Verses'' had been banned by the Indian Government under pressure from several Muslim leaders, who insisted that the novel - two hallucinatory chapters of which involve a prophet who is and is not Mohammed - was insulting to Islam, blasphemous. By the end of October, the controversy had surfaced elsewhere, and angrily - in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Egypt, South Africa, every country or city with a sizable Muslim population, including London, where the book had been published in late September and had quickly become a best seller.\nRushdie and his book were denounced in mosques around the city. Hundreds of protest letters (most of them form letters, a sign of an organized campaign) were arriving each day at the London offices of Viking, the book's publisher. Leaders of Islamic groups attending the annual Conservative Party convention in Brighton called on the Thatcher Government to ban the book; and it was reported that Britain's Attorney General had been asked to begin criminal proceedings against Rushdie under the archaic blasphemy laws. Rushdie received several phone threats. When, on the night of Oct. 25, he attended the awards dinner for Britain's most prestigious literary prize, the Booker -''The Satanic Verses,'' with its many good reviews, was among the six novels nominated, but did not win - he was accompanied by a bodyguard.\nIn the months that followed, the controversy would not abate. Two weeks ago, in the city of Bradford in northern England, 1,500 Muslims held a demonstration at which they burned copies of the novel. W.H. Smith, Britain's biggest bookseller (it has 430 shops), withdrew the book from display in its two Bradford outlets - this at a time when it remained high on the best-seller lists. Officials at Viking, which is believed to have paid an advance of about $800,000 for world hardbound and paperback rights to the book - a huge sum for a literary work - is bracing for similar protests here next month, when Rushdie arrives in the United States to give public readings from the book. Already, in New York, Viking has received protest letters and calls from thousands of American Muslims, and there have also been a number of bomb scares, which are being investigated by the F.B.I., at the company's offices.\nI had suggested to Rushdie, when I'd talked with him on the phone, that it might not be such a safe thing for him to walk around Brick Lane.\n''You cannot let something like this take over your life, or you have lost,'' he said. He sounded frustrated, beleaguered.\nWas he sure?\n''They're not going to know my face from the book jacket. They're not allowed to buy the book.''\nI took a taxi to Rushdie's home in a northern borough of London, and he greeted me at the door, smiling and shaking his head. ''So strange, all this, isn't it,'' he said. Rushdie's face was dominated last fall by a black, gray-flecked and somewhat pointy beard, which he has since shaved off - and a number of cartoonists in the English papers had been inspired by it, working him up for the review columns as Satan. But it didn't convince; his eyes, heavy-lidded behind thick glasses, are too soft. There is no hardness, either, to the way he holds himself and speaks. You see in his small gestures and phrasings a hint of formality once adhered to, but this has given way to gentlemanly casualness. The tautness, the sharp edges, are kept within somewhere, to emerge only in the writing.\nWe drove down to Brick Lane in Rushdie's Saab, and parked along a small, charmless side street of small factories and tenements. It was a cold, damp morning, the sky the color of fine ash, and the only ones on the block were three young men unloading heavy rolls of cloth from the back of a truck. Rushdie explained that this was still London's garment district. The garment business had once been owned by English Jews who employed other English Jews, but now it was dominated by the Bengalis. ''That is the mosque down on the corner,'' pointing down the block to what looked to me to be simply a large meeting hall. ''It used to be a synagogue.''\nWe walked down the block, and turned onto Brick Lane, the narrow shopping street from which the neighborhood derives its name. There was a Muslim butcher shop, and the Aladdin Sweet Center, and signs in Arabic script above all the storefronts, and in the air the smell of curry. ''The thing you have to understand about a neighborhood like this,'' Rushdie said now, ''is that when people board an Air India jet and come halfway across the planet, they don't just bring their suitcases. They bring everything. And even as they reinvent themselves in the new city - which is what they do - there remain these old selves, old traditions erased in part but not fully. So what you get are these fragmented, multifaceted, multicultural selves.\n''And this can lead to such strange things,'' he continued. ''You will find teen-age girls in this neighborhood who in so many ways are London kids: Levi 501's, Madonna T-shirts, spiky hair. They never think at all of going back to India or Pakistan, even for a visit. They might actually have been born here in London. And yet you may find among them a willingness, an eagerness in some cases, to have an arranged marriage. An arranged marriage.\n''Or this story: In this very neighborhood, it was early in the 1980's. A Pakistani father stabbed and murdered his daughter, his only child, because he heard she had made love to a white boy. Which turned out not to be true, but that is not my point: My point is that he had brought with him this idea of honor and shame. And when I wrote about this later, I said that although I was obviously appalled - I mean, what can be more awful than murdering your own child? - I understood what had motivated him. I am a first-generation immigrant from that part of the world. I know how you can be here, and, in a way, still there.''\nThe setting for ''Midnight's Children'' is Rushdie's boyhood Bombay, that for ''Shame'' a country he describes as ''not quite Pakistan'' - he had written here but about there. ''The Satanic Verses'' is his first novel to deal with London, with the city that has been his home for 20 years. I asked him why it had taken him so long to write about it.\n''I think I just had to do a lot of things first,'' he said. ''I had to make my reckonings with those other parts of the world I had come from. Before I had the platform from which to approach this country.''\nAs we walked down the street, he pointed out a video shop that rents tapes of Bombay-produced Hindi films, hundreds of different ones.\n''Watching these films is entertainment of course,'' he said, ''but this also nourishes, yes? And in a way, when I go back - inside me, when I've written, if you understand -this going back to the East nourishes me. More than anything else, I would say.''\nLater, as we got back into his car, I asked him if he thought those who wanted his book banned - if he thought they too were, inside themselves, ''going back,'' seeking some kind of nourishment in their religion, their orthodoxy.\n''If you are asking me if I understand them, well yes, I understand them. But in a way they are not 'going back' to something. Their extremism is actually something fairly new. I have written about Islamic culture in the novel - Islamic culture set against the background of the West. Basically, Islamic culture is the one in which I grew up - I know it well. Its narratives are my narratives.''\n''But their Islamic culture is something new and dangerous. You have a situation where a handful of extremists are defining Islam. And what makes it even sadder for me is that they are simply feeding the Western stereotype: the backward, cruel, rigid Muslim, burning books and threatening to kill the blasphemer.''\nTHE FOLLOWING morning, I walked up to the London Central Mosque in St. John's Wood -the city's largest mosque and, I was told, the organizational base for the protest against ''The Satanic Verses.''\nThe mosque is huge, with a glittering golden dome I could glimpse, despite the day's thick fog, as I walked toward it through Regent's Park. I wanted to see Dr. Ali Mugram al-Ghamdi, director general of the Islamic Cultural Center, which has its offices at the mosque. Dr. al-Ghamdi was leading the fight against ''The Satanic Verses'' in London - he had been quoted as calling the novel ''the most offensive, filthy and abusive book ever written by any hostile enemy of Islam.'' I had tried to phone him, and could not get through, and so I'd decided to simply present myself.\nIt was a Friday, prayer day, not the best day to talk, his secretary explained, but yes, Dr. al-Ghamdi would see me. He emerged from his office minutes later. He was a short and round man, elegantly dressed in a pin-stripe suit and fine silk tie. He extended his hand in greeting, invited me in, and pushed closely together two chairs, where we sat.\nI explained how I had spoken the day before with Rushdie about his novel, its spiritual themes. After our walk in Brick Lane, we had gone to a pub, and at one point, as we talked, he had said, ''I obviously did not set out to write a novel about Islam - and it is not a novel about Islam. The novel does deal with spiritual life, very much so - that's one aspect of the book. There is a hole inside me where God used to be - I am no longer an observant Muslim - and I wanted to explore this hole. And of course that's what novels do, isn't it? Explore.''\nAnd now, sitting with Dr. al-Ghamdi, I asked if he could understand the book in this way - as an inquiry.\n''The book is really very, very offensive,'' he said gently, with no bitterness. ''I cannot overstate this. And I cannot expect you - you who are not a Muslim - to feel this.'' Then, addressing my question more directly: ''This was something that the author deliberately did. This was not just a slip of the pen.''\nWe discussed the parts of ''The Satanic Verses'' that have caused most offense to fundamentalist Muslims. Gibreel Farishta, who back in Bombay had starred in popular religious films, suffers a breakdown, and we are made privy to his mad dreams, dreams in which he supposes himself to be the Archangel Gabriel. For many Muslims, the Koran is held to be the ''uncreated'' Word of God, dictated by the Archangel Gabriel through the Prophet Mohammed, and written down, perfect and unaltered, by the Prophet's scribes.\nIn the dreams of Rushdie's Gibreel, a certain Salman the Persian, in the employ of the Prophet Mahound, makes a deliberate mistake in his transcription - he wants to see just how divine the Prophet is - and when the Prophet reads over the text, the mistake goes unnoticed.\nRushdie also ''redreams'' (his word) the famous episode in Islam of the ''Satanic verses,'' from which the novel takes its title. Historians of Islam explain it this way: Mohammed was under pressure from the citizens of Mecca to moderate his staunch monotheism, to accommodate his new faith to the city's traditional polytheism, to make room in Islam for three local goddesses. He did; he had his scribes write down verses praising al-Lat, al-Uzza and Manat as the ''swans exalted, whose intercession is hoped for.'' But he soon revoked these verses. He'd had a true revelation from the Archangel Gabriel, who told him they had been dictated by Satan.\nMahound, too, is visited by Satan and tempted to do more than utter compromised verse to scribes. Mahound likes to eat what he forbids others to - ''those fabled and legendary unclean creatures, what's their name, prawns.'' He also likes the whores. Where, in the Koran, Mohammed has many wives, revered as the Mothers of the Believers, the fictional Mahound has a brothel.\nI said to Dr. al-Ghamdi that even though Christian fundamentalists might object to the use of Christian allegory and symbol in a novel like ''The Scarlet Letter,'' or to historical depictions of Christ in movies like ''The Last Temptation of Christ,'' they have come to see that in Western society, there is no way to enforce religious orthodoxy. Anyway, I said, most Western readers would understand Mahound as a religious hypocrite, a satiric creation, nothing more, nothing historical.\nDr. al-Ghamdi looked now to be practicing patience. ''For us,'' he said, ''this is not a matter of long ago. The Prophet Mohammed and his family are alive for us. They are here, with us, and we love them so much. I am prepared - and not only me - I am prepared to die one thousand deaths to assure that Mohammed and his family are not hurt. Such anguish this book has caused.''\nI asked him what the solution was.\nHe wanted the book banned, he said. He would like Viking to act on its own, to withdraw the book from the stores.\nI told him that Viking had issued statements saying it had not meant to offend anyone, that it regretted any distress the book may cause, but that it believed in Rushdie, his novel - and especially in freedom of expression. I said that freedom of expression was a very important Western concept.\n''Islam has never been accepted here all through history,'' Dr. al-Ghamdi said. ''Here, you can just trample on people's feelings. You call that freedom of expression? And then you are shocked when emotions run high.''\nI asked him about the threats made on Rushdie's life. What did he feel about these threats? Wasn't he, whether he realized it or not, inciting people with his talk?\nHis face tensed. ''We are trying to project a mature community here,'' he said. ''I am doing my best to keep the community in check.''\nHe got up from his chair, walked over to his desk, and lifted from it a manila folder thick with papers. ''These letters,'' he said, ''you should see what people say.'' I asked if I could read them. ''They are in Arabic,'' he said. ''You do not read Arabic.'' He picked one up himself, then another, then another. And now he giggled a little. What did it say? ''This is not for you,'' he said. Our meeting was over.\nTHAT EVENING, I was invited to a dinner party at Rushdie's home. It was to be a New England-style Thanksgiving feast, planned and cooked by Rushdie's wife, the American writer Marianne Wiggins. (Rushdie's first marriage ended in divorce several years ago. He has a 9-year-old son by the marriage, Zafar.) Their house is a four-story row house on what had not long ago been a working-class block, and Rushdie's studio is on the top floor; there, each morning at an electric typewriter, he tries to write 700 good words. He had yet to begin a new novel, that would take time, much thinking. He would travel first, write essays. Rushdie is a writer in the very English way of Orwell - he takes stands. He has written a slim, sympathetic book about Sandinista Nicaragua, and he has frequently spoken out - in the British papers, on television -on what he sees as Britain's two great problems: ''institutionalized'' racism (in employment practices and housing), and the domestic policies of the Thatcher Government.\nRushdie's politics do not sit well with many in English literary circles, and especially, it would seem, with the press. He is described as arrogant, self-righteous. Challenging Rushdie's thinking about racism in England, and his sincerity as well - and perhaps revealing the very tension he is seeking to deny - a reporter in The Sunday Times of London Magazine recently wrote: ''Certainly he is assimilated to the extent of being one of the 20 just persons summoned to the [ Harold ] Pinter dinner table in Campden Hill Square to discuss opposition to Thatcherism.''\nIn the front room on the parlor floor as I entered Rushdie's house that night, I saw two large tables: There were to be many guests. A number of them were already downstairs, clustered in the kitchen and in Wiggins's study: the critic Michael Ignatieff; the American writer Michael Herr, author of the Vietnam book ''Dispatches''; the poet Tess Gallagher, in town for a memorial held in honor of her husband, Raymond Carver. A literary crowd; Rushdie has many friends in literary circles, too. And Rushdie was in good spirits, truly at home (as most writers are) among writers he likes.\nUpstairs later, watching Rushdie propose a toast above the all-American turkey and stuffing and sweet potatoes, I recalled a passage from ''The Satanic Verses'': An Indian boy, at boarding school in England only a few days, comes down to breakfast to find a kipper on his plate. He has no idea how to eat it, and his fellow students have no intention of telling him.\n'' [ H ] e cut into it, and got a mouthful of tiny bones. And after extracting them all, another mouthful, more bones. It took him ninety minutes to eat the fish.'' Chewing, he has this revelation: ''England was a peculiar tasting smoked fish full of spikes and bones, and nobody would ever tell him how to eat it.'' He discovers he is tough and vengeful. ''I'll show them all,'' he swears. ''See if I don't.''\nAfter dinner, I asked Rushdie about the kipper: It seemed too painful, too sadly funny, to be anything but autobiographical. ''Yes, I'm afraid it's only slightly embellished,'' he said. ''And I've never eaten another one.''\nHe'd been sent from India to Rugby at age 13. His family was Bombay upper-middle-class; his grandfather had made the family money and his father, who died two years ago, had, in Rushdie's words, ''spent the rest of his life losing it.'' Salman, the only son (he has three sisters), had attended the British-style Cathedral School in Bombay before being sent abroad.\n''I was miserable at Rugby,'' he told me a couple of days later when we sat and talked again at his home. ''I think I had actually wanted to go - I was groomed for it. Very conventional. Bookish - I was the kind of boy who got books for presents. No good at games.\n''But at Rugby I was suddenly an Indian. There are no Indians in India. There are classes, of course, and regional identifications. Here in England, however, it is largely understood as a race - and at the school-boy level, back then, that was no fun.'' The boys at Rugby not only watched Rushdie struggle with his kipper, but scrawled racist graffiti. He has told friends of his that he never really made a friend there.\nHis father had attended King's College, Cambridge, and he expected his son to follow when he was graduated from Rugby. Rushdie refused, then pleaded, then enrolled for classes in the fall of 1964. He knew he wanted to be a writer, he told me - his hero, he said, was the acclaimed Urdu poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz. However, he chose to study not literature but history. (Most of the references to Islamic history in ''The Satanic Verses'' are drawn from one of his college papers.) Rushdie liked Cambridge. It was the 1960's: ''Everyone was rethinking things,'' he said. ''I was too.'' He became interested in the theater, got parts and worked backstage as well in a number of college productions.\nIn the spring of 1968, he graduated from Cambridge, and returned home - not to Bombay, but to Karachi. His parents had moved there several years before. ''I was so angry they had moved to Pakistan,'' he said. ''But in truth when I'd left England, I'd only purchased a one-way ticket.''\nHis stay in Pakistan turned out to be short, sour. Not long after arriving, he began putting together a production of Edward Albee's ''Zoo Story'' for the country's new government-operated television station.\n''Well,'' he said. ''it turned out one of the lines in the play includes the word 'pork.' A character is regularly attacked by his landlady's dog, and to keep the dog away he goes and buys these hamburgers, which he tosses to it. It doesn't work: The dog doesn't go for the hamburgers. And the character has to say something to the effect that he can't understand why the dog doesn't like the hamburgers. After all, there isn't enough pork in them to make them disgusting.\n''O.K. The play is censored. One can't say the word 'pork' on TV in Pakistan. So I appeal. I say, What more could you ask for? Here is a play in which an actor points up how disgusting pork is. I mean, this is very sophisticated antipork propaganda if you consider it. But no one saw it that way. Pork was simply a four-letter word.''\nAn article he wrote for a small magazine on his first impressions of Pakistan was also censored. Before the end of the year, he was back in England. He would return East in the future only to visit.\nIt was in 1970, after having worked for a time in experimental theater, when Rushdie turned his energies to writing fiction. ''I'd always imagined myself telling stories, and now I imagined I had stories to tell,'' he said.\nBeginning at that time as well, and then for 10 years, he worked to support himself as an advertising copywriter, first at Ogilvy and Mather, then at Charles Barker. Nights, weekends he devoted to his novels. Drafts came slowly (and still do; it took Rushdie five years to complete ''The Satanic Verses''). He abandoned one novel, about a Muslim holy man. Late in 1973, having taken time off from his advertising job, he completed what would be his first published novel, ''Grimus'' - a dystopian allegory set on an imaginary island, a novel quite remote from the kind of writing he would do later. (The book was poorly received.) However, the language, aural and eclectic, hints at things to come, as does this line from the book: ''It is the natural condition of the exile, putting down roots in memory.''\nThis process of using one's own stories and experiences began for Rushdie with ''Midnight's Children,'' which he completed in 1979. He had traveled to Bombay shortly after finishing ''Grimus,'' and the trip had been important to him. He decided at that time not only to write an autobiographical novel, but to write one that would encompass the biggest of India's cities, its people and history.\n''I think I saw the Bombay I had grown up in slipping away,'' he told me, ''and that made me get on with the writing. I felt I had to reclaim the city - and also my own memories of it. I wanted to tell India's story, or stories, as well as my own.'' ''Floating in the amniotic fluid of the past,'' as he writes in ''Midnight's Children,'' Rushdie not only found his own story, and that of the nation of India; he found a way of telling. He mixed the fabulous and the historic, he made room for anecdotes, tales, essayistic asides, political commentary, digressions, retracings, sidetracks - the draft of the novel ran to 900 pages.\n''Midnight's Children'' was a huge critical success. It won the 1981 Booker Prize, and along with the prestige came a check for $10,000. Rushdie was 34, but in a photo I have seen of him holding up the check, he could be a struggling graduate student, save for the grin that conveys: I guess I showed you.\nON MY LAST DAY IN London, I visited Rushdie again, and we talked more about his novel. But talk kept spilling beyond strictly literary matters. The Islamic fundamentalists came up again. ''I am most afraid that they will succeed in reducing the novel in people's minds to a pamphlet,'' he said.\nTwo weeks ago, after the Bradford book burning, I spoke with Rushdie on the phone, and he said: ''When they burned my book, in a way as if it were a pamphlet, I think they went too far. It is such a charged image. It got people concerned about me, sympathetic toward me, who had been content to sit on the sidelines. There were Labor Party M.P.'s - Asians representing Bradford - who attended that book burning; that's a horrible thought for many people. They get to thinking, 'If it's him today, it's me tomorrow.' ''\nIt struck me, his use of ''him,'' ''me,'' ''they.'' I remembered what he had told me just before I left his house that day in London:\n''In writing 'The Satanic Verses,' I think I was writing for the first time from the whole of myself. The English part, the Indian part. The part of me that loves London, and the part that longs for Bombay. And at my typewriter, alone, I could indulge this.\n''But most of the time, people will ask me - will ask anyone like me - are you Indian? Pakistani? English?\n''What is being expresssed is a discomfort with a plural identity. And what I am saying to you - and saying in the novel - is that we have got to come to terms with this. We are increasingly becoming a world of migrants, made up of bits and fragments from here, there. We are here. And we have never really left anywhere we have been.'' THE TROPICAL ISLE\nGibreel Farishta floating on his cloud formed the opinion that the moral fuzziness of the English was meteorologically induced. 'When the day is not warmer than the night,' he reasoned, 'when the light is not brighter than the dark, when the land is not drier than the sea, then clearly a people will lose the power to make distinctions, and commence to see everything -from political parties to sexual partners to religious beliefs - as much-the-same, nothing-to-chose, give-or-take. What folly! For truth is extreme, it is so and not thus, it is him and not her; a partisan matter, not a spectator sport. It is, in brief, heated. City,' he cried, and his voice rolled over the metropolis like thunder, 'I am going to tropicalize you.'\nGibreel enumerated the benefits of the proposed metamorphosis of London into a tropical city: increased moral definition, institution of a national siesta, development of vivid and expansive patterns of behaviour among the populace, higher-quality popular music, new birds in the trees (macaws, peacocks, cockatoos), new trees under the birds (coco-palms, tamarind, banyans with hanging beards). Improved street-life, outrageously coloured flowers (magenta, vermilion, neon-green), spider-monkeys in the oaks. A new mass market for domestic air-conditioning units, ceiling fans, anti-mosquito coils and sprays. A coir and copra industry. Increased appeal of London as a centre for conferences, etc.; better cricketers; higher emphasis on ball-control among professional footballers, the traditional and soulless English commitment to 'high workrate' having been rendered obsolete by the heat. Religious fervour, political ferment, renewal of interest in the intelligentsia. No more British reserve; hot-water bottles to be banished forever, replaced in the foetid nights by the making of slow and odorous love. Emergence of new social values: friends to commence dropping in on one another without making appointments, closure of old folks' homes, emphasis on the extended family. Spicier food; the use of water as well as paper in English toilets; the joy of running fully dressed through the first rains of the monsoon.\nDisadvantages: cholera, typhoid, legionnaires' disease, cockroaches, dust, noise, a culture of excess.\nStanding upon the horizon, spreading his arms to fill the sky, Gibreel cried: 'Let it be.'

According to international law, Nepal is entitled to one transit point. India has kept open four transit points on the India-Nepal border. No consignments are held up or awaiting clearance.\nYou write that Representative Durbin was ''disturbed'' after visiting the region and has asked Congress to urge India to reopen the border. We understand that Mr. Durbin visited Nepal, Bangladesh and India in January-February, almost two months before the treaties lapsed. Your report is to that extent not correct. The India-Nepal border is not closed. Only the transit trade crossings have been decreased in number.\nIt is highly unfair on your part to attribute the current trade and transit dispute between India and Nepal to Nepal's relations with third countries. When bilateral treaties lapse, they are renegotiated bilaterally. You may like to note that India has unilaterally offered to Nepal essential commodities for purchase - such as sugar, baby food, medicines, coal, etc. - which demonstrates a degree of magnanimity on the part of India, not the characteristics of a ''bully.'' Total availability of such products in Nepal will depend upon the volume and value for which contracts are signed by Nepal and the Nepalese parties, and not merely upon the number of transit points.
