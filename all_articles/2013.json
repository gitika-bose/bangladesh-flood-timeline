    "text": "Abercrombie & Fitch Signs Bangladesh Safety Plan\n2013-05-16T00:30:38.000Z\nAbercrombie & Fitch said on Wednesday that it had signed on to a landmark plan to improve factory safety in Bangladesh, becoming just the second American company to join an accord that more than two dozen European retailers and brands have embraced.\nThe only other American signatory is PVH Corporation, the parent company of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger.\nUnder the legally enforceable plan, retailers and apparel companies have committed to having rigorous, independent factory inspections, and to helping underwrite any fire safety and building repairs needed to correct violations.\n\u201cWe are committed to Bangladesh and support industrywide efforts to improve safety standards,\u201d said Kim Harr, director of sustainability at Abercrombie, which had $4.5 billion in revenue last year. \u201cWe believe this is the right thing to do to bring about sustainable, effective change.\u201d\nThis week, a flood of European retailers joined the plan, including H&M, Carrefour, Mango, Primark, Marks & Spencer and Inditex, the parent of Zara. Momentum to join the plan grew after a factory building in Bangladesh collapsed on April 24, killing more than 1,100 workers.\nWith so many European companies signing on, pressures have increased on American retailers to join, with much of that pressure focused on Gap, the world\u2019s third-largest apparel company, which is often viewed as an industry leader on social responsibility. The plan\u2019s supporters predicted that numerous other American retailers would follow suit if Gap signed on.\nLabor advocates and officials in Washington said there were intense internal discussions within Gap about whether to back the plan. In recent days, Gap has been the most vocal critic of the plan, saying it feared that joining would subject it to undue liability. \nGap sent a letter to employees at its headquarters on Wednesday, saying, \u201cWe take our commitment to improving working conditions in Bangladesh very seriously.\u201d The letter said Gap had hired a fire inspector to examine the 78 factories it uses in Bangladesh and had promised up to $22 million in loans for factories to make safety improvements. \nIndustriALL Global Union, a federation of unions from 140 countries that has negotiated with numerous retailers, urging them to join the plan, announced late Wednesday that a total of 31 companies had signed on.

    "text": "Bangladesh Needs Strong Unions, Not Outside Pressure\n2013-04-30T01:02:06.000Z\nBANGLADESH, my country, is again in tears. Last week in Savar, a suburb of Dhaka, the capital, a poorly constructed building that housed garment factories and other businesses collapsed. More than 300 have been confirmed dead, and the final death toll could well exceed 700. \nBangladesh is no stranger to disasters, both natural and man-made. Still, this is one of the saddest chapters since we won our independence in 1971, precisely because the tragedy could easily have been prevented. Structural weaknesses had been found but not fixed. The victims were among the most vulnerable in our society \u2014 hardworking people making an honest, but meager, living. Many died manufacturing clothing for Western brands. \nI appreciate the unease a Westerner might feel knowing that the clothes on his or her back were stitched together by people working long hours in dangerous conditions. It is natural that people in richer countries are now asking how they can put pressure on Bangladesh and its manufacturers to improve the country\u2019s dismal safety record. \nBut ceasing the purchase of Bangladeshi-manufactured goods, as some have suggested, would not be the compassionate course of action. Economic opportunities from the garment industry have played an important role in making social change possible in my country, with about three million women now working in the garment sector. I have dedicated my life to alleviating entrenched poverty, and I know that boycotting brands that do business in Bangladesh might only further impoverish those who most need to put food on their tables, since the foreign brands would simply take their manufacturing contracts to other countries. \nThe rise of manufacturing here has had good effects. In the past, for example, a poor family\u2019s vision for a newborn daughter\u2019s future was often to marry her off as young as possible, since the dowry paid to a husband\u2019s family grows as a daughter gets older. Even after the dowry was outlawed in 1980, the practice continued. A girl would often be married off as young as 13, and would never leave her village, never know a brighter future for herself or her children. \nPartly because many women and their daughters now take garment industry jobs \u2014 even in factories where workers\u2019 rights are virtually nonexistent \u2014 families living in poverty have changed their vision of the future. More have acquired long-term goals, like educating their sons and daughters, saving and taking microloans to start new businesses, and building and maintaining more sanitary living spaces. \nMany outsiders think only of calamity when they hear the word Bangladesh \u2014 of factory fires, cyclones, floods and poverty. But the true Bangladesh is also the birthplace of microfinance and home to a robust civil society. It has seen rapid gains in living standards: maternal mortality is one-quarter of what it was in 1990; early childhood mortality is one-fifth of what it was in 1980, and we have eliminated the gender gap in primary and secondary school enrollment.\nThese remarkable gains will mean little if we allow tragedies like the one at Savar to continue. The law must work for everyone, rich and poor, landless laborer and factory owner alike. We must not allow those who benefit from the exploitation of the vulnerable to continue to treat life so cheaply. \nWhat, then, is the solution? The changes must come first from Bangladesh itself. My country will require new political will to hold accountable those who willingly put human lives at such grave risk. It will also require the support of factory owners; civil society organizations, including my own; and the private sector, including Western buyers. \nThe solutions start with the workers themselves; they must be allowed by their employers to unionize, so they can engage in collective bargaining and hold their employers responsible for basic standards of pay and safety. Their organized power is the only thing that can stand up to the otherwise unaccountable nexus of business owners and politicians, who are often one and the same. \nWestern buyers, instead of squeezing factory owners on price, should finance better safety standards. The point needs to be made in the marketplace overseas that safety improvements are not so expensive that they can be used as an excuse for raising prices to the consumer. And consumers who are shocked by the working conditions need to realize that a playing field where the price tag is the only standard for a purchase is not a level one when workers\u2019 lives are at stake. \nAt the same time, the owners themselves cannot be let off the hook, for there is no excuse for criminal negligence. But they cannot be trusted to voluntarily do all that they might. In a country with 100,000 factories in and near the capital, and three million workers in its garment industry, an inspection force numbering 18 people only invites unconscionable lapses on the part of unscrupulous employers. The inspection force must be increased drastically, and it must vigorously enforce safety standards.\nThe government, finally, must stop neglecting worker safety issues, even as it steps up enforcement. But that will be extremely difficult to accomplish as long as there is an unholy web of employers and politicians colluding to avoid responsibility for criminal negligence; that, in the end, is what trapped thousands of workers in the flimsy factory building that collapsed on them in Savar. Those workers cannot be forgotten until these issues are resolved. \n\u201cMade in Bangladesh\u201d should be a mark of pride, not shame. Bangladeshi civil society stands ready to work with the authorities to make this so. In the 1970s, during the early years of my country\u2019s nationhood, Bangladesh was suffused with the energy of the struggle for independence, a yearning for freedom from exploitation. From this energy came microfinance, community health work, and other social innovations that, combined with new economic opportunities in export industries like textiles, have transformed the lives of tens of millions of poor people, particularly women. \nToday I grieve with my fellow countrymen, but I also raise my voice to say that this must not continue. As we mourn our losses, let us rekindle that spirit of liberation. ",

    "text": "Garment Trade Wields Power in Bangladesh\n2013-07-25T02:19:46.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 In the honking, congested heart of this overcrowded capital, one glass office tower stands uniquely alone, surrounded by water, accessible by a small bridge. It is a symbol of the power of Bangladesh\u2019s garment industry, the headquarters of the country\u2019s most powerful association of factory owners. It is also illegal.\nSo said the Bangladesh High Court, concluding that the land had been illegally obtained, the building had been erected without proper approvals and the location threatened a network of lakes that form the natural drainage system of the capital. The High Court called the building \u201ca scam of abysmal proportions\u201d and ordered it demolished within 90 days.\nThat was two years ago. The building still stands. The case is now in a legal limbo \u2014 more proof, according to critics, of the power of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. Members control the engine of the national economy \u2014 garment exports to the United States and Europe. Many serve in Parliament or own television stations and newspapers.\nFor two decades, as Bangladesh became a garment power, now trailing only China in global clothing exports, the trade group has often seemed more like a government ministry. Known as B.G.M.E.A., the organization helps regulate and administer exports and its leaders sit on high-level government committees on labor and security issues. Industry trade groups in the United States could only imagine such a role. \nBut the April collapse of the illegally constructed Rana Plaza factory building, which killed more than 1,100 people, has placed the entire global supply chain that delivers clothes from Bangladeshi factories to Western consumers under scrutiny. And the quasi-official garment group, in the eyes of its critics, presents a major conflict of interest at the center of Bangladesh\u2019s troubles and is a big part of the systemic problems that have made the country a dangerous place for garment workers.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t put the fox in charge of the chickens,\u201d said Rizwana Hasan, an environmental lawyer. \u201cB.G.M.E.A. has no regulatory authority under the laws of the country. It\u2019s a clubhouse of the garment industry.\u201d\nBangladesh is working to restore the garment industry\u2019s credibility after last month\u2019s decision by the Obama administration to suspend a special trade preference for the country. The European Union is also considering penalties. Bangladesh has responded by passing new labor laws and pledging to inspect the structural safety and legal compliance of the nation\u2019s 5,000 garment factories.\nIn both instances, the garment group\u2019s interests were well represented. It has hired a team of engineers and is helping oversee the post-Rana Plaza factory inspections \u2014 even as the High Court cited the group for a litany of violations on its own headquarters. Meanwhile, the trade group brought its influence to bear in a lobbying campaign as Parliament amended the labor laws this month.\nBangladeshi officials promised to overhaul their labor laws, which fall short of standards defined by the International Labor Organization and tend to suppress unions, contributing to safety problems, labor advocates say. But the results of the overhaul were less significant, especially for the garment industry. One amendment required that industries create profit-sharing programs for workers. But exporting industries, notably the garment sector, were exempted. \nRestrictions on labor organizing were eased, but far from fully lifted. The new law requires that 30 percent of factory workers must sign petitions to form a union, a telling obstacle given that many factories have thousands of employees and have few places to hold meetings and organize.\n\u201cBangladesh had a golden opportunity,\u201d said Roy Ramesh Chandra, a labor leader, who said that the political influence of factory owners diluted some of the amendments. \u201cThe employers have tremendous influence.\u201d\nBusiness interests dominate Bangladesh\u2019s Parliament. Of its 300 members, an estimated 60 percent are involved in industry or business. Analysts say 31 members, or 10 percent of the country\u2019s national legislators, directly own garment factories, while others have indirect financial interests in the industry.\nFactory owners say their political clout is vastly overstated and dismiss suggestions that they exert influence over top elected leaders, and some analysts agree their influence is sometimes overstated. But the trade group clearly is part of the process in ways that set Bangladesh apart.\nThree years ago, the prime minister created an industrial police force to maintain order in factory districts and act as an independent arbiter to solve disputes between workers and management. But many workers and labor organizers say the force almost always favors owners. The trade group is even supposed to buy patrol cars for officers.\n\u201cThis organization is extremely powerful,\u201d said one senior government official, who said much of its clout comes from political contributions. \u201cThe political parties are running after money.\u201d\nThe trade group was formed in 1983 as Bangladesh, then one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, was trying to build its economy by developing a garment industry. Initially, it had no headquarters and no bank account. \n\u201cWhen I first went out there, the B.G.M.E.A. was run out of a garage,\u201d said Don Brasher, who worked as a trade consultant to Bangladesh for more than a decade. \u201cIt was not institutionalized at all.\u201d\nThat quickly changed. Under the rules of global textiles, developing countries faced restrictions on garment exports and, in the case of the United States, were assigned trade quotas. Managing this quota system was critical and complicated. Bangladesh\u2019s government decided to delegate administrative tasks to the trade group \u2014 including the authority to regulate certain transactions and collect fees.\n\u201cThat was pretty extraordinary,\u201d said Mr. Brasher, who lived in Dhaka for two years and worked closely with the group on the quota system. \u201cOrdinarily, that is done by a government agency. There\u2019s nothing like that, anywhere. But it was done out of necessity.\u201d\nBangladesh\u2019s government is notoriously corrupt and has limited bureaucratic capacity to handle the intricate mechanics of global trade. Politics is ferociously contested and marred by regular nationwide strikes, known as hartals. In this environment, the group became a stabilizing force as global trade rapidly grew.\nEven after the quota system expired in 2005, the trade group steadily expanded its regulatory responsibilities. Today, it enjoys a near stranglehold on exports: only factories that are among its members are allowed to export woven garments, with some exceptions. The group regulates the importation of fabric and issues certificates of origin, the required proof that a garment is made in Bangladesh. It has arbitration committees to settle disputes and administers the often-complex practice of subcontracting.\nOn a recent evening, Atiqul Islam, the group\u2019s president, sat at his desk and signed applications from factory owners seeking duty-free status to import machinery. A half-hour earlier, he had presided over a news conference about a skills training program for workers that the group had organized with the United Nations Development Program, the British international development agency UK-AID and the International Labor Organization.\n\u201cZero power,\u201d he said while signing the tax waiver applications, flicking away a question about the group\u2019s influence. \u201cThe government decentralized a few things to us, so we are doing them. We can do it much faster.\u201d\nMany factory owners portray the industry as a public service, providing millions of jobs. The health of the garment sector is often seen as a national security issue, with the industry accounting for 80 percent of Bangladesh\u2019s manufacturing exports and providing critical foreign exchange. It is the trade group that maintains order in daily operations of the industry, owners say.\n\u201cOtherwise, there would be chaos,\u201d said Annisul Huq, a former president of the trade group. \u201cYes, we can criticize the B.G.M.E.A. But it has a very strong role. Somebody has to lead.\u201d\nFactory owners face many challenges in Bangladesh, including high interest rates on loans. But the heroic self-image of the sector is somewhat overstated. Garment factories enjoy subsidies and tax breaks not offered to other industries, and pay less tax. A recent study in a Bengali-language newspaper estimated that these subsidies and tax breaks exceeded tax revenues from the industry by roughly $17 million.\n\u201cThe doors of the treasury are open for them,\u201d said Badiul Alam Majumdar, secretary of the nonprofit group Citizens for Good Governance. \u201cThey extract all kinds of subsidies. They influence legislation. They influence the minimum wage. And because they are powerful, they can do, or undo, almost anything, with impunity.\u201d\nOne unlikely critic of the trade group is Rubana Huq, the wife of Mr. Huq, who is now the managing director of the family\u2019s garment conglomerate, Mohammadi Group. She said the garment industry in Bangladesh has matured and must be regulated by a transparent, independent arbiter, possibly a new government ministry.\n\u201cOf course, there is a conflict of interest,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no reason why a body like B.G.M.E.A. would be credible with the international players.\u201d\nMs. Huq and other critics point to the headquarters building as a symbol of its protected status. Environmentalists have long protested and argued that the building\u2019s location on a de facto island inside a city lake impedes the natural drainage network and contributes to flooding in the capital during the monsoon.\nIllegalities abounded, according to the High Court ruling: construction started before the group had won final approval on a building plan; the land transfer from a government agency violated national laws on usage of public land. Yet the group\u2019s leaders argue that the building\u2019s status has been validated at the highest level: two prime ministers led different inauguration ceremonies at the site.\n\u201cIt is not illegal,\u201d said Mr. Huq, his voice rising. \u201cWe have applied to the government for the land. The government has given us the land. Two prime ministers have opened it. What validation do you want?\u201d\nBut Iqbal Habib, an architect who designed the plan to renew the lake system, said the group could not be exempted from rules governing others. \u201cThey are always talking about their compliance with the buyers,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat about their compliance with the laws of the country?\u201d\nFor now, the case is stalled. The Supreme Court is supposed to hold a final hearing, but with elections coming, the government has shown little interest in confronting the country\u2019s most powerful industrial bloc. It is unclear if a hearing will take place.\n\u201cIt has gone to the Supreme Court,\u201d Mr. Huq said. \u201cThat could take forever. It is Bangladesh. We have full trust \u2014 as long as they give a verdict in our favor.\u201d\nHe is smiling, joking, to a degree.",

Sounds of her splashing punctuated the lesson, along with the din of mooing cows and bleating goats. A wooden boat full of passengers and bicycles chugged past. \nThe classroom was on a wooden boat moored to a riverbank near the village of Nasiar Kandi, Natore District, in northwestern Bangladesh. It is one of 20 free \u201cfloating schools\u201d run by Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha, a nonprofit organization that has reached almost 70,000 children. \nIn Bangladesh, annual flooding can disrupt school for hundreds of thousands of students. In some areas, roads are impassable during the rainy season from July to October, when rivers rise as much as 4 meters, or 12 feet. In 1998, the same year Shidhulai was founded, flooding inundated two-thirds of the country, killing 700 people and leaving 21 million homeless. \nBangladesh is a delta formed by the confluence of major rivers and is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. More than one million Bangladeshis could be displaced or affected by rising sea levels by 2050, according to the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,  and flooding is likely to worsen in what is one of the world\u2019s most densely populated countries, with 152 million people. \n\u201cThe school on land is closed in monsoon,\u201d said Eti Khatum, 9, a student on the boat school, with two long ponytails and a gold-colored shawl. \u201cThis school floats all year.\u201d \nPascal Villeneuve, the Unicef representative for Bangladesh, wrote in an e-mail, \u201cMaking sure that schools are resilient against natural disasters should be a priority for any disaster risk reduction preparedness and planning.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cWe know from experience, getting children back into a school environment as soon as possible is the best way to help them recover from the shock and destruction of a natural disaster.\u201d \nMohammed Rezwan, Shidhulai\u2019s founder and executive director, grew up in the country\u2019s northwest, where his organization operates. \nHis family owned a boat, which meant that he was one of the lucky ones who could attend classes year-round, but some of his childhood friends were prevented from going to school for months at a time because of flooding. \n\u201cMany friends and relatives were denied access to education,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, if the children cannot come to school because of floods, then the school should go to them by boat.\u201d \nHe founded Shidhulai with about $500 in 1998, the same year that he graduated with an architecture degree from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology in Dhaka. \nOnly 22 at the time, he had no experience in fund-raising. But he trawled the Internet for organizations that could help him and submitted proposals. His first boat school was introduced in 2002. \nIn 2003, Shidhulai received a $5,000 grant from the Global Fund for Children in the United States, and then $100,000 from the Levi\u2019s Foundation, part of the clothing company that has factories in Bangladesh. \nA $1 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2005 allowed Shidhulai to build more boats, buy computers, install solar power and create a central library. Last year, it added another boat after winning a $20,000 prize from the World Innovation Summit for Education, or WISE, created by the Qatar Foundation. \nMr. Rezwan designed the schools by modifying traditional Bangladeshi wooden boats called noka. They are about 15 meters long and 3 meters wide \u2014 or about 50 feet by 10 feet \u2014 with main cabins that can fit 30 children and a teacher. Weatherproof roofs can withstand heavy monsoon rains and are supported by arched metal beams instead of columns, which would obstruct the classroom. It takes three or four months, plus about $18,000, for local boat builders to refurbish an old vessel. An additional $6,500 a year is needed to pay for salaries, supplies, fuel and other costs. \nThe organization now has 20 schools \u2014 mostly for the young children of landless families \u2014 10 libraries and 7 adult education centers, all on boats. There are also five floating health clinics that help transport medical staff to remote areas. \nMr. Rezwan plans to add 100 more boats in the next five years to reach an additional 100,000 people.\n\u201cOur floating schools are combination of school bus and school house,\u201d he said.\nStudents board at rural pickup points and then attend classes for two or three hours, six days a week. In many cases, this will be all the education they get. \nFree adult classes, meanwhile, focus on practical issues. One afternoon, a room of women in brightly colored saris sat on a boat to watch a slide show by an agricultural expert, who taught them how to use organic insecticides made of neem tree leaves, among other tips. \nKhadiza Begum, 27, said that over the past four years, she had learned to grow cucumber and different types of gourds, increasing her crop yields. Without the boat schools, she added, \u201cthere is no other way to learn.\u201d \nShidhulai employs more than 200 staff members \u2014 including 61 teachers and 48 boat drivers \u2014 and 300 volunteers. \nThe boat schools are registered with the Education Ministry, which provides free materials for grades three and four. Shidhulai trains the teachers, who are from the local community and usually have a 12th-grade education. \nShidhulai also distributes solar lamps, provides training for growing flood-resistant crops and creates floating gardens and duck coops for landless people. \nIn a floating library down the river, students checked cricket scores on two computers and perused books from the 1,500 available volumes. The late afternoon light was fading, but solar-powered lights let them continue their work. \nSweetie Khatun, an 11-year-old reading a book called \u201cRhyme From the Lips of Birds,\u201d declared that she loved the library and said that it was \u201cbeautiful.\u201d",

    "text": "17 Days in Darkness, a Cry of \u2018Save Me,\u2019 and Joy\n2013-05-10T04:45:52.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Day after day, the grim drudgery of digging for bodies had progressed at Rana Plaza. Talk of rescuing survivors had faded. This was the recovery phase, and what was being recovered were corpses, the numbers spinning remorselessly forward: 700 dead became 800, then 900, with no end in sight.\nBy Friday morning, the number had pushed above 1,000. And then, late in the afternoon, a soldier from the Bangladeshi Army, standing atop the rubble of the wrecked building, noticed an iron rod that seemed to be moving. There was a noise, a voice. Rescuers hurriedly carved a hole through a concrete pillar. Television stations in Bangladesh cut to the scene: a woman, gasping, was alive in the wreckage, nearly 17 full days after Rana Plaza had collapsed.\nA new number was announced: One. A female garment worker named Reshma. A survivor. A miracle.\n\u201cSave me!\u201d rescuers heard her shout, before they pulled her into the afternoon light, her face powdered in dust as she was placed on a stretcher.\nThe Rana Plaza collapse is now considered the deadliest disaster in the history of the garment industry. Five factories were operating inside the building when the structure pancaked downward. The carnage was horrific and has focused global attention on unsafe conditions in Bangladeshi garment factories that make clothing for North American and European consumers \u2014 especially since there were advance warnings that the structure was unsafe.\nThe rescue of Reshma, as described by rescuers and government officials, has offered a temporary respite from the gloom and a startling tale of resilience: she survived in an opening maybe 10 feet by 8 feet in size, high enough for her to stand, within a penumbra of collapsed beams and pillars. Air trickled through the crevices. She found enough food and water to last until two days ago.\n\u201cI never dreamed I\u2019d see the daylight again,\u201d she told local Somoy TV from her hospital bed, according to news accounts.\nReaction in Bangladesh was euphoric. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina rushed to the military hospital where Reshma had been taken. Twelve days earlier, on April 28, rescuers had worked desperately to save another woman, Shaheena, who was then thought to be the last survivor. But she died after a fire broke out in the final hour of the rescue operation.\nReshma\u2019s rescue, if amazing, is not without precedent. More than two weeks after the catastrophic 2010 earthquake in Haiti, a 16-year-old girl was discovered inside a collapsed home, having survived by eating yogurt and vegetables, and a man was found in the rubble of Port-au-Prince many days after that. But experts say such incidents are extremely rare.\nAt Rana Plaza, recovery crews had little hope of finding a survivor when work began on Friday. A five-member army rescue team had begun using heavy machinery to crack into an area of the building\u2019s basement but found it flooded with water. As they worked from the first floor, searching for the source of water, they noticed a movement.\n\u201cSuddenly we saw the movement of a stick,\u201d Major M. M. Moazzem Hossain, a member of the team, said in an interview. \u201cSomeone from the second floor was trying to draw attention by inserting a stick through a narrow hole. When we reached there, we asked, \u2018Is there anyone inside?\u00a0\u201d\nA female voice shouted out, \u201cSave me!\u201d\nMajor Hossain said the woman had told him her name was Reshma.\n\u201cWe are with you,\u201d he said he had told her. \u201cWe will not move out from this place without rescuing you.\u201d\nNow the soldiers and a group of firefighters began cutting a hole, using a hand drill and hammers, to try to reach her. \u201cWe were aware of the tragic accident during the operation to rescue Shaheena,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we were very careful.\u201d\nFor an hour, they kept cutting, making a hole about a foot and a half in diameter. Major Hossain said he squeezed through the hole and helped bring Reshma out. Startled, gazing curiously into the sunlight, Reshma was placed on a stretcher and taken immediately to the military hospital.\nIt is unclear exactly where in the factory she had been trapped, especially since the floors were compressed together after the collapse. Some officials have said she was inside the basement, though Rezaul Karim, deputy director of the Bangladesh Fire Service, said it was more likely she had been on either the first or second floor.\n\n21 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\n\u201cWe found her in the middle of these two floors,\u201d he said.\nInitially, some officials said she had been discovered inside a Muslim prayer room but those accounts now appear to be wrong, Officer Karim said.\nInstead, she found refuge in an unusually large space created by falling beams and pillars. Many survivors had been trapped in crawl spaces barely two feet high. But Reshma was in a space large enough for her to stand, sleep and walk, Major Hossain said. She also had found water and food, though her food apparently became rotten and inedible two days ago. Garment workers usually bring their lunches and it is possible she was trapped in an area where lunches had been stored.\n\u201cReshma was quite strong, and there was adequate oxygen,\u201d he added. \u201cWe only gave her juice and water.\u201d\nThe Rana Plaza death toll, now at 1,053, has been rising quickly in recent days, and will probably keep climbing. Located in an industrial suburb of Dhaka, Rana Plaza exemplified many of safety problems plaguing the garment industry in Bangladesh, the world\u2019s second-leading garment exporter, trailing only China.\nThe authorities in Bangladesh now say the building was illegally constructed, with permits obtained through political influence. The owner, Sohel Rana, now in jail, was illegally adding upper floors to the structure at the time the building collapsed, officials said.\nThe accident has intensified pressure on global brands and retailers that buy clothing from factories in Bangladesh to improve worker safety. In November, at least 112 workers died in a fire at the Tazreen Fashions factory, which was producing clothing for Sears, Walmart and other global brands and retailers. Earlier this week, a smaller factory fire killed at least eight people.\nThe Rana Plaza disaster led to nationwide mourning in Bangladesh as well as outrage because it appears that the accident could have been averted. A day before the collapse, an engineer examined cracks in the structure and warned Mr. Rana, as well as owners of the garment factories, that the building was unsafe and should be closed. Instead, workers were told to come to their factories the next morning.\nFor now, though, a sliver of joy has been found in the wreckage, with the name of Reshma.",

    "text": "U.S. Retailers Announce New Factory Safety Plan\n2013-05-31T00:31:59.000Z\nFeeling pressure from consumer and labor groups for not doing more to ensure factory safety in Bangladesh, Wal-Mart, Gap and numerous other retailers along with the nation\u2019s main retail federations are seeking to forge a new plan to promote safety in that country\u2019s apparel industry.\nThis effort, to be spearheaded by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit group based in Washington, was announced on Thursday, two and a half weeks after dozens of retailers and apparel companies, almost all of them European, announced a far-reaching plan aimed at ensuring factory safety in Bangladesh.\nAs part of the new effort, the National Retail Federation, the American Apparel and Footwear Association as well as Gap, JCPenney, Sears, Target, Wal-Mart and other retailers, will seek to \u201cdevelop and implement a new program to improve fire and safety regulations in the garment factories of Bangladesh,\u201d according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.\nThis effort will be led by two prominent members of that group, former Senators George J. Mitchell, a Democrat, and Olympia J. Snowe, a Republican, both from Maine.\nBut some labor advocates called the effort divisive and a sham.\nAfter a factory building collapsed in Bangladesh on April 24, killing at least 1,127 workers, Western retailers faced more pressure than ever to take action to ensure factory safety in that country, the world\u2019s second-largest apparel exporter after China. In response, H&M, Carrefour, Marks & Spencer and more than two dozen other European companies backed a binding plan in which they agreed to rigorous independent inspections of the factories they use in Bangladesh and to help finance improvements for fire and building safety.\nOnly a few American retailers signed on, however. On Thursday, Sean John, the fashion company run by Sean Combs, announced that it would become the third United States company to join, following PVH, the parent company of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Abercrombie & Fitch. Loblaw, a Canadian retailer that produces the Joe Fresh clothing line, has also joined that plan.\nWith about 40 companies signed on to that plan, Gap, the Children\u2019s Place and several other American retailers have faced protests and a flood of Facebook posts, urging them to join.\nBill Chandler, a Gap spokesman, welcomed the new effort. \u201cWe see the American alliance as a powerful path forward,\u201d he said. Jessica Deede, a Target spokeswoman, said, \u201cWe have been engaged with the Bipartisan Policy Center\u2019s initiative as a potential solution.\u201d\nThe center said Mr. Mitchell, Ms. Snowe and the North American retailers would seek to release their plan by early July. The effort also includes the Retail Industry Leaders Association and the Retail Council of Canada.\nIn assessing the new plan by American retailers, Richard M. Locke, an expert on overseas manufacturing at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T., said, \u201cI think they must be feeling the heat because people are asking them, \u2018Why don\u2019t you join this other initiative?\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nProfessor Locke added: \u201cThe idea that you would bring all these people together in this new effort is a good first step. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good to have competing initiatives.\u201d\nPhilip J. Jennings, general secretary of Uni Global Union, a worldwide federation of 20 million retail and service workers that helped develop the initial Bangladesh factory safety plan, criticized the new effort.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sham,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no valid reason why they can\u2019t join the initiative we have launched. It has been well received,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cNow they seem to want to paddle their own canoe on their own terms.\u201d\nOfficials from several American retailers have voiced concern that their companies would face large legal liability if they were to join the European-dominated plan. But several backers of that accord say the Americans are shying away because they dislike the binding obligations and potential costs of the plan.\nOn Wednesday, officials from Wal-Mart, Gap and several other retailers met in New York to begin moving ahead with the plan. Kevin Gardner, a Wal-Mart spokesman, lauded the effort, saying, \u201cThere is a need to partner with other stakeholders to improve the standards for workers across the industry.\u201d\nScott Nova, executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a factory monitoring group, said the new effort would \u201ccontain no real obligation on the part of brands and retailers to pay for the building renovations necessary to convert deathtraps in Bangladesh into safe factories.\u201d",

    "text": "Clothed in Misery\n2013-04-30T01:03:50.000Z\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass.\nTHE collapse last Wednesday of a Bangladeshi factory complex \u2014 the latest, deadliest chapter in the story of miserable labor conditions in the international garment industry \u2014 must seem distant to many Americans. Their tragedy is not ours because their working conditions, and construction regulations, are not ours. \nBut the story of manufacturing half a world away is as close as the Lycra-cotton cloth that swaddles us. It is as intimate to our private interests as our boxers are, stitched in those bunkers by hands we never see and rarely consider.\nSimilar disasters happened here in the first phase of our national industrialization \u2014 the 1878 Washburn mill explosion in Minneapolis, the 1905 Grover Shoe Factory disaster in Brockton, Mass., the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in Manhattan \u2014 but back when New England textile mills were the beating heart of America\u2019s mass-production infancy, the most notorious was the 1860 collapse of the Pemberton Mill in Lawrence, Mass. \nThe upper floors of the Pemberton building were supported by cheap iron columns. Late on a Tuesday afternoon, Jan. 10, too many of the weaving machines fell into rhythm, everything began to shudder, and the building tore itself apart. The columns cracked, the floors splayed, the walls bulged and then burst outward, and a hideous cataract of timber, men, women, working children and iron machines collapsed into a heap of blood and crushing tonnage. \nSeveral hundred people were trapped or dead in the wreckage. Men and women staggered across the ruins, pulling bloodstained workers out of the tangle. As darkness fell, someone\u2019s lantern ignited the oil and cotton dust in the air, and the bones of the building became an inferno with women still pinned inside. \nThe writer Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, a child at the time, remembered that the women still trapped in the blaze tried to sing to keep up their courage. \n\u201cThey were used to singing at their looms \u2014 mill girls always are \u2014 and their young souls took courage from the familiar sound of one another\u2019s voices,\u201d she would recall. \u201cThey sang the hymns and songs which they had learned in the schools and churches: \u2018Heaven is my home,\u2019 \u2018Jesus, lover of my soul,\u2019 and \u2018Shall we gather at the river?\u2019 Voice after voice dropped. The fire raced on.\u201d \nIn the end, 88 people died and 116 were seriously injured. As in the recent Bangladeshi manufacturing disasters, including one last November in Dhaka that killed at least 117 people, the dangers to workers had been pointed out in a routine inspection long before the disaster. The Pemberton Mill\u2019s flimsy metal columns had been marked as unsafe for years. It had not been profitable to replace them. \nThese Bangladeshi disasters do not merely share a kinship with the Lawrence one, but a genealogy. They are part of a cyclical system that has governed the textile industry since it moved out of cottages and into mills.\nAgain and again we see the same pattern, which stretches back to the original hiring of rural New England girls to operate the first spinning and weaving machines. The girls were delighted, for the most part, to leave behind rural drudgery. After a few decades, management began various cost-cutting measures that eventually became untenable. Labor activism spread rapidly and was countered, sometimes brutally. To avoid increased expenses associated with labor reform, the mill managers essentially would flush their working population and pull in a new one. Protestants were flushed in favor of destitute Catholics. The Irish were hired in the same New England mills in the 1840s, and then, when they became too demanding, the French Canadians, the Italians \u2014 waves of immigrants, one after the other. \nIn this way, for the last 200 years, garment manufacturing has flowed from ethnicity to ethnicity, as well as from region to region, from New England to the Middle Atlantic states, from North to South. Each group, when it begins to demand more accountability and a living wage, is discarded. Manufacturing change flows quickly to stay ahead of legislative change. Like water, industrial management seeks a route of least resistance \u2014 eventually flowing out of our shores altogether in the 1990s and, finally, flooding (among many other places) the alluvial plains of Bangladesh. \nThis cycle has its positive elements, offering an alternative to rural poverty and producing cheap clothing, sometimes for those regions and ethnicities that once were the system\u2019s underclass. There are those manufacturers (most famously, Levi Strauss) who have made a solid effort to serve their workers as well as their investors. \nAnd yet, with unvarying historical predictability, the cycle also involves tremendous suffering: riots, like those in Dhaka last year; the persecution of labor organizers, like Aminul Islam, who was tortured and murdered last year; legislative dodges, like the perennial lagging of Bangladesh\u2019s minimum wage; child-labor infractions that leave whole populations reaching adulthood without money, education or hope; and the generations of workers who are laid off during downturns and end up with nothing to show for a life of toil. And then there are the catastrophic disasters arising from the interminable squeezing of expense. \nThe sad part is that the price of individual garments would not have to go up much \u2014 1 percent to 3 percent, various estimates say \u2014 to provide a living wage and safer conditions for all those cutting and stitching what we wear. The cycle could slow or even stop. But that 1 percent to 3 percent would have to wend all the way down that river of production \u2014 past the eddies and breakwaters of corporate boards and middlemen, subcontracting agents and compradors, to reach those who really need it. \nIt\u2019s well past time for all of us to reflect on this cycle and how cheap it would be to break out of it if only there were enough public pressure on the apparel industry. The cost for us is minimal; the cost for others is great. Bargain-hunters at Wal-Mart and haute couture customers on Fifth Avenue alike should shame those companies that pass the savings on to us as they pass the suffering on to others we never see. This is not a remote or distant problem. \nTake a look at the tag on your shirt. The problem is as close as your skin. ",

    "text": "Another Garment Factory Scare in Bangladesh\n2013-06-13T15:54:54.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 A fire erupted at a garment factory on the outskirts of Dhaka on Thursday morning, sending employees fleeing in terror and raising more questions about safety conditions in Bangladesh less than two months after the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory building claimed more than 1,100 lives.\nBangladesh is the world\u2019s second leading clothing exporter, after China, and Thursday\u2019s fire again exposed the dangers facing workers in many factories making clothes for consumers in the United States and Europe.\nThe blaze erupted in the Ashulia industrial district, on the northern tier of Dhaka, at about 9:30 a.m. on the ground floor of a company that labor activists and other witnesses identified as Arva Textile Limited, although some Bangladesh news agencies spelled the name as Arba. Black smoke poured out of the windows as some workers were injured while rushing to escape. No fatalities were reported and firefighters doused the flames within about two hours.\nLabor activists who rushed to the burning factory said they had found clothing labels for Dickies, the name brand of the Williamson-Dickie Manufacturing Company, a storied American business that describes itself as the world\u2019s largest work-wear manufacturer.\nWilliamson-Dickie said in an emailed statement that its European affiliate had halted business with Arva in February, and that its records indicated no association with the other company in the burned building, Hasmatullah Knitwear.\nThe statement did not explain why business with Arva had been stopped, but that Williamson-Dickie \u201cmaintains a strict Code of Conduct and social compliance program to which all business affiliates must adhere \u2014 including global Williamson-Dickie offices, distributors, contractors, sourcing offices and licensees.\u201d\nAbdul Hamid, a senior fire official, said the cause of the blaze was not yet determined. But it erupted in an enclosed, ground-floor room where fabric was stored in the six-story building. Arva Textile rented the first three floors of the building and Hasmatullah Knitwear rented the upper three floors.\n\u201cThe fire did not spread to other floors of the building as it was a locked warehouse,\u201d Officer Hamid said, noting that firefighters had to break through a wall in order to douse the flames in the storage area.\nThere were conflicting reports on whether Arva Textile had adequate firefighting equipment. Fire officials told Bangladeshi media outlets that the factory lacked proper fire extinguishers and other things. However, Officer Hamid said he thought the factory had an appropriate fire safety license.\nBrig. Gen. Ali Ahmed Khan, director general of Bangladesh\u2019s Fire Service, said both factories in the building had been recently granted conditional fire safety licenses through next month. He said inspectors had found shortcomings, notably a lack of on-site water resources in case of fire \u2013 a problem that had not been rectified by Thursday. Firefighters were forced to import water from other areas, causing delays in extinguishing the blaze.\n\u201cIf these factories do not improve their shortcomings within a month, we won\u2019t renew their fire licenses,\u201d he said.\nMohammed Obaidullah, owner of the upstairs knitwear factory, said his workers were able to escape by filing down two staircases that did not pass through the ground-floor storage area. He said his factory had been audited, passing compliance standards, and produces jackets for a European brand marketing in Germany, Turkey and Britain.\nInternational labor rights groups say that hundreds of workers have died in fires in Bangladeshi factories during the past decade. Last November, a fire erupted at the Tazreen Fashions factory, killing 112 people, as workers were making items for Walmart, Sears and other retailers. In that incident, the blaze also began on the ground floor, where the owners had illegally stored huge mounds of fabric without enclosing them in fireproof walls.\nAs was the case on Thursday, factories often share the same building. Five factories were inside the Rana Plaza building when it collapsed in April, killing 1,129 people, in what is considered the deadliest disaster in the history of the garment industry. Rana Plaza had been shoddily built, atop filled wetlands, yet workers had been ordered inside even after an engineer had examined cracks in the structure and warned the building was unsafe.",

Bangladesh is still reeling from the collapse two weeks ago of the Rana Plaza complex, a disaster that so far has claimed at least 892 lives \u2014 most of them workers at five garment factories operating in the building.\nFor years, fire safety has been a persistent problem in Bangladesh\u2019s garment factories.

Monzur Morshed, as well as the factory\u2019s managing director, Mahbubur Rahman. Mr. Rahman was also a director of the country\u2019s most powerful industry trade group, the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association.\nA factory security guard told bdnews24.com that repairs were under way on the factory\u2019s electrical system when the fire broke out.

    "text": "7 Die in Fire at Factory in Bangladesh\n2013-01-26T19:12:30.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 In the latest blow to Bangladesh\u2019s garment industry, seven workers died Saturday after a fire swept through a factory here not long after seamstresses had returned from a lunch break. Workers said supervisors had locked one of the factory exits, forcing some people to jump out of windows to save their lives.\nThe fatal fire comes roughly two months after the blaze at the Tazreen Fashions factory left 112 workers dead and focused global attention on unsafe conditions in Bangladesh\u2019s garment industry. Tazreen Fashions, located just outside Dhaka, the capital, had been making clothing for some of the world\u2019s biggest brands and retailers, including Walmart.\nIn the aftermath of the Tazreen Fashions fire, political and industrial leaders in Bangladesh pledged to quickly improve fire safety and even conducted high-profile, nationwide inspections of many of the country\u2019s 5,000 clothing factories. And global brands promised they would not buy clothes from unsafe factories.\nBut Saturday\u2019s fire in a densely populated section of Dhaka is a grim reminder that the problems remain. The blaze erupted about 2 p.m. at Smart Garment Export, a small factory that employed about 300 people, most of them young women who were making sweaters and jackets. All seven of the dead workers were women.\nMasudur Rahman Akand, a supervisor in the fire department, said the factory\u2019s workers were returning from lunch when the blaze erupted in a storage area. The factory was located on the second floor of a building, above a bakery, and it lacked proper exits and fire prevention equipment, Mr. Akand said.\n\u201cWe did not find fire extinguishers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did not find any safety measures.\u201d\nWith smoke filling the factory floor, workers apparently panicked. Mr. Akand said the seven workers who died either suffocated or were trampled by people trying to escape. \nEight other workers were hospitalized with injuries. Some of them told rescuers that many people could not quickly escape because one of the exits was blocked by a locked steel gate. Witnesses said people began jumping out of windows before the gate was unlocked.\nAzizul Hoque, a police supervisor, said the investigation was continuing. \u201cWe do not know the reason or the source or the origin of the fire,\u201d he said.\nIt was unclear whether the Smart Garment factory was making clothing for international brands or retailers. Dhaka\u2019s industrial areas are filled with factories, large and small, that produce clothing for much of the Western world. ",

    "text": "Western Firms Feel Pressure as Toll Rises in Bangladesh\n2013-04-25T06:10:26.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 As rescuers struggled on Thursday to reach survivors in one of the worst manufacturing disasters in history, pointed questions were being raised about why a Bangladesh factory building was not padlocked after terrified workers notified the police, government officials and a powerful garment industry group about cracks in the walls.\nAs the death toll neared 300, the owner of the collapsed building, the eight-story Rana Plaza, was in hiding, and the police and industry leaders were blaming him for offering false assurances to factory bosses that the structure was sound, leading to the decision to allow 3,000 workers return to work.\nPressure continued to build on Western companies that had promised after a deadly fire in November to take steps to ensure the safety of Bangladeshi factories that make the goods the companies sell. Activists combing through the rubble here have already discovered labels and documents linking the factories to major European and American brands, like the Children\u2019s Place, Benetton, Cato Fashions, Mango and others.\nPVH, the parent company of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Tchibo, a German retailer, have endorsed a plan in which Western retailers would finance fire safety efforts and structural upgrades in Bangladeshi factories \u2014 although they first want other companies to sign on.\nWalmart has refused to join that effort. But, in January, it announced that it would demand that factories quickly correct any safety violations and would dismiss any contractor that uses unapproved or unsafe factories. Two weeks ago, Walmart pledged $1.8 million to establish a health and safety institute in Bangladesh to train 2,000 factory managers about fire safety.\nOn Thursday, the Bangladeshi authorities opened an investigation into the collapse, while the police brought negligence charges against the building\u2019s owner, Sohel Rana, his father and the owners of four factories in the building. Bangladesh\u2019s High Court also issued a summons for Mr. Rana, who is involved in local politics for the country\u2019s ruling party, the Awami League. He has been ordered to appear in court next Tuesday.\nThe immediate question was why the garment factories on the upper floors of the Rana Plaza building in Savar, outside Dhaka, the capital, were operating when the structure collapsed Wednesday morning. Industry leaders continued to point to Mr. Rana and what they said were his false assertions that the structure was safe. \u201cBased on that, they ran the factories yesterday,\u201d said Mohammad Atiqul Islam, the president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, in a telephone interview. He said his staff had told factory owners on Tuesday to stay closed until the building was inspected. \u201cWe had very clearly told the owners not to open.\u201d\nBut analysts said that, based on past experience, there was likely to be plenty of blame to go around, with harried factory owners scrambling to fill orders under tight deadlines imposed by their Western customers.\n\u201cEven in a situation of grave threat, when they saw cracks in the walls, factory managers thought it was too risky not to work because of the pressure on them from U.S. and European retailers to deliver their goods on time,\u201d said Dara O\u2019Rourke, an expert on workplace monitoring at the University of California, Berkeley. He added that the prices Western companies pay \u201care so low that they are at the root of why these factories are cutting corners on fire safety and building safety.\u201d\nNumerous Western apparel companies issued statements acknowledging that they had used factories in the building and voicing their condolences.\nPrimark, a British retailer, confirmed it was using a factory on the building\u2019s second floor and said it was \u201cshocked and deeply saddened by this appalling incident.\u201d Primark said it has been engaged for several years with nongovernmental organizations and \u201cother retailers to review the Bangladeshi industry\u2019s approach to factory standards.\u201d\nLoblaw, a Canadian retailer that markets the apparel brand Joe Fresh, said one factory produced \u201ca small number\u201d of Joe Fresh garments. \u201cWe are extremely saddened\u201d by the building collapse, Loblaw said in a statement, adding that, \u201cwe will be working with our vendor to understand how we may be able to assist them during this time.\u201d\nBut a few Western companies, including Benetton, denied having garments made there, even though documents were found linking those companies to factories in Rana Plaza. Worker advocates said it was possible that subcontractors were using the factories without the companies\u2019 knowledge.\nWhat is increasingly clear is that the collapse should not have been a surprise. Factory fires have killed hundreds of garment workers in the past decade. At the same time, many factory buildings are substandard and unsafe. Bangladeshi fire officials say the upper floors of Rana Plaza were illegally constructed.\nOn Tuesday, the day before the collapse, news began spreading about cracks in the building. A local television journalist, Nazmul Huda, said he rushed to the scene but that local men employed by the building\u2019s owner had prevented him from entering the building and filming the damage.\n\n14 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nMr. Huda said that local police officers had also arrived at the building, but that they did not appear concerned and instead warned him not to run a story. (He said his station, ETV, did so anyway.) He said a local police supervisor later reassured him that an engineer had inspected the cracks and had found no problems.\n\u201cLocal police and the local administration did not give importance to this problem,\u201d Mr. Huda said. \u201cThey could have locked the building.\u201d\nAbdus Salam, the director general of the Industrial Police, a special law enforcement agency that oversees garment factories, said his district commander had also received a complaint about the building on Tuesday and had rushed to the scene.\n\u201cPeople were rushing out,\u201d Officer Salam said in a telephone interview. \u201cThey saw the cracks in the walls.\u201d\nHe said his district commander asked the factory owner to close the building until an inspection had been conducted. But when two of his officers returned Wednesday morning, Officer Salam said, the factories were operating. He said the two officers entered the building to investigate and are still missing after the accident.\nAt the scene, thousands of people gathered around the collapsed building, as family members of missing workers volunteered in the search. Blood collections were under way across Dhaka. Rescue teams comprising soldiers, paramilitary officers and firefighters were expected to keep searching on Friday, though officials refrained from using heavy machinery to clear debris.\n\u201cIf we use heavy equipment, the building might collapse again,\u201d said Brig. Gen. Ali Ahmed Khan, head of the National Fire Service. \u201cThe rest of the surviving workers might die if the building collapses further.\u201d\nBangladesh\u2019s government declared Thursday a national day of mourning, but anger and outrage spilled onto the streets. Hundreds surrounded an industrial building in the heart of Dhaka, upset that garment factories continued to operate inside, and tossed bricks at the windows, demanding that work be stopped. Thousands of garment workers also staged protests in industrial districts ringing the capital.\nBangladesh is the world\u2019s second-leading exporter of apparel, and the domestic garment industry depends on a low wage formula in which the minimum wage is about $37 a month. Garment exports are a critical driver of the Bangladeshi economy, which creates pressure to keep wages low and workers in line. Labor unions are almost nonexistent in the industry; one labor organizer, Aminul Islam, was brutally killed last year in a case that is still unsolved.",

M. Monzur Morshed, as well as the factory\u2019s managing director, Mahbubur Rahman. Mr. Rahman was also a director of the country\u2019s most powerful industry trade group, the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association.\nA factory security guard told bdnews24.com that repairs were under way on the factory\u2019s electrical system when the fire broke out. According to the company\u2019s Facebook page, the Tung Hai factory was filling orders for several European clothing brands and retailers.",

    "text": "Bangladeshis Burn Factories to Protest Unsafe Conditions\n2013-04-26T09:29:24.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Thousands of garment workers rampaged through industrial areas of the capital of Bangladesh on Friday, smashing vehicles with bamboo poles and setting fire to at least two factories in violent protests ignited by a deadly building collapse this week that killed at least 340 workers.\nThe protests, which continued into Saturday, came as rescue teams spent a third day searching for survivors in the rubble of the building, the Rana Plaza, in a suburb of the capital, Dhaka. Officials reported that 72 people were pulled out alive, a rare bit of good news in what is already considered the deadliest accident in the history of the garment industry \u2014 with a death toll expected to keep rising.\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina ordered the arrests of the owner of Rana Plaza, as well as the owners of four garment factories that were operating on the upper floors of the eight-story building. Pressure also mounted on Western clothing brands that rely heavily on Bangladesh to manufacture their products; labor activists have found labels inside the wreckage for clothes being made for J. C. Penney, Cato Fashions, the British retailer Primark and other clothing brands.\nTwo of the factory owners turned themselves in to the police early on Saturday, bdnews24.com, an online newspaper, reported.\nA special government committee has been appointed to investigate the accident, and questions are already arising about why more than 3,000 employees were working at Rana Plaza when it collapsed on Wednesday morning. Cracks had been discovered in the structure a day earlier, and police officials and industry leaders say they had asked the factory bosses to stop work until the building had been inspected.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it an accident,\u201d the government\u2019s information minister, Hasanul Haque Inu, told Bangladeshi journalists. \u201cI would say it\u2019s a murder.\u201d\nFriday\u2019s violent protests ricocheted among industrial sections of Dhaka as garment workers took to the streets to vent their fury. Many of the protesters demanded the death penalty for Sohel Rana, the owner of the building, as well as the owners of the garment factories on the upper floors. More than 150 vehicles were reported damaged, and some protesters burned two factories.\nIn Narayanganj, an industrial district near the capital, protesters vandalized at least five garment factories and clashed with the police, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas.\nTen people were injured and nearly two dozen workers were arrested on vandalism charges after demonstrations halted traffic on a major road.\nLabor groups in the United States on Friday distributed photos showing that they had discovered garments with labels from J. C. Penney and El Corte Ingl\u00e9s, the Spanish retailer, at the site of the collapse. Seeking to press American retailers to do more to assure factory safety in Bangladesh, dozens of worker advocates held protests on Thursday at the Gap\u2019s headquarters in San Francisco and at a Walmart store in Renton, Wash.\nA leading factory monitoring group, the Business Social Compliance Initiative, which is based in Brussels, said that two of the factories in the building \u2014 New Waves Style and Phantom Apparel \u2014 were inspected and had complied with the group\u2019s code of conduct.\nAnother factory in the building, Ether Tex, said on its Web site that it had passed an inspection by a monitoring group in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, the Service Organization for Compliance Audit Management. The Web site said Ether Tex was being evaluated by the Business Social Compliance Initiative.\n\n14 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nOfficials from such monitoring groups say they generally focus on internal matters, like smoke detectors and whether exit doors are locked, and not on matters like fire escapes or the soundness of a building\u2019s structure, which are normally the responsibility of government inspectors.\nLabor activists and human rights groups called on retailers and global brands to help pay for programs to improve factory safety and upgrade fire prevention equipment, a need underscored by a November fire that killed 112 workers. Activists say that spending about $600 million a year for five years could bankroll sweeping improvements to the country\u2019s 5,000 garment factories \u2014 noting that global brands could finance such a program by agreeing to pay an additional 10 cents per garment for the more than six billion articles of clothing exported each year.\nLeaders of two Bangladesh garment industry trade groups announced Friday that factories in their association would close for the weekend so that workers could aid in the rescue efforts at Rana Plaza. Atiqul Islam, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, called on the owner of Rana Plaza and the owners of the factories inside the building to surrender to the authorities.\nMr. Islam also said that the trade group would hire engineers to examine the structural stability of all the country\u2019s garment factories.\nThe Bangladeshi military has established a command center near Rana Plaza to coordinate rescue efforts. Teams of soldiers, paramilitary police officers and ordinary citizens were carefully digging through the rubble, sometimes with their bare hands.",

    "text": "After Bangladesh, Seeking New Sources\n2013-05-16T00:24:10.000Z\nSEMARANG, Indonesia \u2014 Bennett Model helped pioneer the exporting of garments from China in 1975, the year before Mao Zedong died, and ever since, his New York fashion company has searched for other countries, from Guatemala to Vietnam to Indonesia, capable of supplying top retailers like Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus.\nThe relentless search for new locations has taken on more urgency after the deadliest industrial accident in the global garment industry\u2019s history, a multistory factory collapse in Bangladesh that left 1,127 people dead. Buying from Bangladesh, said Mr. Model, \u201chas been politically incorrect ever since problems started there, so a lot of major players had already been looking for alternatives.\u201d\nWhen a senior executive from one of the largest American mass-market retailers called him last week with worries about suppliers in Bangladesh and plans for a trip to Vietnam and Cambodia to seek alternatives, Mr. Model was ready with advice: \u201cI told him to add a stop in Indonesia.\u201d\nMany Western executives are taking such trips this spring. A lethal factory fire in Bangladesh last November, 33 regional or national strikes there since January, hundreds of deaths in factional street fighting there since February, and the Rana Plaza collapse in late April have left multinational corporations scrambling for other options.\n\u201cRight now, the name of Bangladesh just gives a bad rep to a company,\u201d said Mr. Model, the dapper chief executive of Joseph Model Associates, which designs and distributes the Annabelle New York brand of high-end apparel and also makes private-label brands for various department store chains.\nWestern executives are checking on potential new suppliers in southern Vietnam, central Cambodia and the hinterlands of Java in Indonesia. Yet safety problems could exist anywhere. The ceiling of a small factory that makes shoes in central Cambodia collapsed on Thursday morning, killing at least two people and injuring nine, three of them severely.\nThe JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, a favorite of Western garment buyers, is nonetheless so full these days that it is hard to book a room on short notice. Indonesian garment executives say they have seen a steady procession of arrivals in recent weeks and months, always asking the same questions about political stability, labor laws, safety compliance and wages.\n\u201cAt first it was because of China getting too expensive, then came the Bangladesh fire tragedy, and then there have been so many steps in Bangladesh\u2019s troubles,\u201d said Ade Sudradjat, the chairman of the Indonesian Textile Association. \u201cSome buyers feel uncomfortable placing orders in Bangladesh.\u201d\nMany multinationals are exploring their options in case street clashes and politically motivated national strikes worsen in Bangladesh, which is the world\u2019s second-largest garment manufacturer after China. A new faction in the country\u2019s Islamist movement has staged more violent protests lately that have sometimes resulted in the temporary closure of factories.\nGarment manufacturing makes up a fifth of the economy in Bangladesh and four-fifths of its exports, which means that one of the world\u2019s poorest, most densely populated countries is desperately dependent on continued export orders to stave off soaring unemployment and possibly further political unrest. Some executives say that many multinationals will continue buying from Bangladesh, although some may diversify their orders to more countries.\n\u201cPeople are on the one hand looking at contingency plans in case the unrest gets worse,\u201d said Bruce Rockowitz, the group president and chief executive of Hong Kong-based Li & Fung, one of the world\u2019s largest sourcing companies. \u201cThere are some people who want to move completely away from Bangladesh, but there are only a few of them.\u201d\nTessel Pauli, a spokeswoman for the Clean Clothes Campaign, dismissed retailers\u2019 worries about civil unrest as a disingenuous excuse to avoid improving safety standards there. \u201cPolitical turmoil has been existing in Bangladesh over the last decade,\u201d she said, while adding, \u201cOf course, they should make it clear to the government that bloodily suppressing street demonstrations should stop immediately.\u201d\nDozens of impoverished countries make T-shirts and other very basic clothing. But only a few countries \u2014 really just China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Indonesia and to some extent Cambodia and Pakistan \u2014 have developed highly complex systems for producing and shipping tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of identical, high-quality shirts, blouses or trousers to a global retailer within several weeks of receiving an order.\nThe clothing needs to be labeled correctly so that it travels smoothly through a large retailer\u2019s distribution centers and arrives on schedule at each store around the world. The process requires formidable numbers of skilled workers who can oversee quality control as well as labeling and shipping of garments. Big retailers and fashion companies have repeatedly tried and failed to develop alternatives, experimenting in India, Africa and Latin America, only to run into infrastructure bottlenecks and shortages of skilled managers or workers.\nMr. Rockowitz said that all of the potential successors to Bangladesh for very large-scale garment exports were in Asia. Mr. Model said that India was not organized for large-scale, timely production, Africa did not have enough workers with the right skills for high-volume labeling and shipping, and Latin America did not have enough workers interested in operating sewing machines.\n\n8 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nTwo years ago, Mr. Model spoke enthusiastically about a factory that he had found in Guatemala, which he saw then as an alternative to China and Southeast Asia that was much closer to the United States, which could shorten delivery times.\nBut Mr. Model said in a telephone interview several days ago that he recently stopped buying from the factory in Guatemala and switched his orders to two factories in Vietnam instead; he also relies on production here in Semarang for knit dresses. In Guatemala, the quality was excellent, he said, but, \u201cThey can\u2019t handle big orders and they\u2019re slow on delivery.\u201d\nBy contrast, Mr. Model said that he had always refused to place orders in Bangladesh for his customers. He said that he and a couple of other suppliers of elite retail chains always worried about Bangladesh\u2019s reliance on high-rise factories, in which workers can be trapped on upper floors during a fire, instead of the single-story and two-story designs found in Southeast Asia.\nIndonesia, for example, has had an industry code since the early 1990s that garment factories may not be more than two stories high so evacuation will be easier during fires, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. Union leaders here say that only a few Indonesian garment factories are taller, because they predate the rule. Even factories with a second floor in Indonesia must make sure that the second floor is open to the first floor with a long balcony or courtyard for easy escape; although there are other labor abuses in Indonesia, local union leaders said that the rule was scrupulously followed.\nRubana Huq, the managing director of the Mohammadi Group, one of the largest garment makers in Bangladesh, said that the prevalence of high-rise factories in Bangladesh reflected the country\u2019s unusually high real estate prices combined with the difficulty of persuading utilities to install electricity and gas connections to larger sites.\nWhat may save Bangladesh from a sharp, immediate drop in export orders is simply that most Southeast Asian factories are already fully booked with orders from multinationals fleeing China\u2019s ever-rising costs. \u201cFor this year, it\u2019s impossible \u2014 we\u2019re already full,\u201d said Suryadi Sasmita, the president of the Indonesian subsidiary of Wacoal, a big Japanese garment manufacturer.\n\u201cThere are definitely customers who are looking for more capacity than we can offer them, because they want to move orders out of Bangladesh and out of China,\u201d said Sanjay Kumar Goyal, the chief financial officer of the Busana Apparel Group, a big Jakarta-based manufacturer.\nMr. Rockowitz estimated that even if political violence escalated sharply in Bangladesh, only 10 to 20 percent of its output, or $2 billion to $4 billion a year worth of goods, could be shifted in the next nine months or so to other countries.\nIndonesia\u2019s national training center for seamstresses \u2014 women make up 98 percent of the students \u2014 is here in Semarang, producing 12,000 graduates a year. But even that isn\u2019t enough. Four factories with a combined employment of 30,000 are to open in the next year in Semarang, and many more factories are being built nearby.\nAsked how these factories would find workers, Sumidi, the school\u2019s director, shook his head and said he hoped to send instructors to factories to train workers on sewing machines there. (Like many Javanese, he uses only one name.)\nNewly opened factories have started competing for scarce seamstresses by offering free meals and free health insurance, said Nurdin Makruf, the vice general secretary of the Semarang chapter of the national union that mainly represents garment workers. Construction companies here are struggling to find enough workers to build all the garment factories now being carved out of the forests of coconut palms, banana trees and conifers that carpet central Java.\nMr. Model predicted that Bangladesh\u2019s lock on mass retailers\u2019 orders would erode.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take time, but it\u2019s going to eventually filter out all over the place,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll take two or three years.\u201d",

    "text": "Bangladeshi Factory Owners Charged in Fire That Killed 112\n2013-12-22T19:37:27.000Z\nNEW DELHI \u2014 The police in Bangladesh charged the owners of a garment factory and 11 of their employees with culpable homicide in the deaths of 112 workers in a fire last year that came to symbolize the appalling working conditions in the country\u2019s dominant textile industry.\nThe case is the first time the authorities have sought to prosecute factory owners in Bangladesh\u2019s garment industry, so powerful that the state has long sought to protect owners from unionization efforts by workers and from international scrutiny of working conditions.\nThe fire at the Tazreen Fashions factory on Nov. 24, 2012, was later eclipsed by a building collapse in April that cost the lives of 1,100 workers and brought global attention to the unsafe working conditions and low wages at many garment factories in Bangladesh, the No. 2 exporter of apparel after China. The fire also revealed the poor controls that top retailers had throughout their supply chain, since retailers like Walmart said they were unaware that their apparel was being made in such factories.\nAmong those charged on Sunday were the factory\u2019s owners, Delowar Hossain and his wife, Mahmuda Akther, as well as M. Mahbubul Morshed, an engineer, and Abdur Razzaq, the factory manager, according to local news reports.\nBangladeshi officials have been under intense domestic and international pressure to file charges against those deemed responsible for last year\u2019s deaths. Fires have been a persistent problem in the country\u2019s garment industry for more than a decade, with hundreds of workers killed over the years.\nBangladesh has more than 4,500 garment factories, which employ over four million workers, many of them young women. The industry is crucial to the national economy as a source of employment and foreign currency. Garments constitute about four-fifths of the country\u2019s manufacturing exports, and the industry is expected to grow rapidly.\nOn the night of the fire, more than 1,150 people were inside the eight-story building, working overtime shifts to fill orders for various international brands. Fire officials say the blaze broke out in the open-air ground floor, where large mounds of fabric and yarn were illegally stored.\nBut on some floors, managers ordered the employees to ignore a fire alarm and continue to work. Precious minutes were lost. Then, as smoke and fire spread throughout the building, many workers were trapped, unable to descend the smoke-filled staircases, and they were blocked from escape by iron grilles on many windows. Desperate workers managed to break open some windows and leap to safety on the roof of a building nearby. Others simply jumped from upper floors to the ground.",

    "text": "Building Collapse in Bangladesh Leaves Scores Dead\n2013-04-24T08:33:02.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 A building housing several factories making clothing for European and American consumers collapsed into a deadly heap on Wednesday, only five months after a horrific fire at a similar facility prompted leading multinational brands to pledge to work to improve safety in the country\u2019s booming but poorly regulated garment industry.\nBy early Thursday, the Bangladeshi news media reported that at least 142 people died in the rubble of Rana Plaza, a building in Savar, an industrial suburb of Dhaka, the capital. Police officials put the death toll at 134, with more than 1,000 of 2,500 workers injured, many of them still trapped. Soldiers, paramilitary police officers, firefighters and other citizens clawed through the wreckage, searching for survivors and bodies.\nBrig. Gen. Ali Ahmed Khan, head of the National Fire Service, said that an initial investigation found that the Rana Plaza building violated codes, with the four upper floors having been constructed illegally without permits.\n\u201cThere was a structural fault as well,\u201d General Khan added, noting that the building\u2019s foundation was substandard.\nThe collapse followed a fire in November that killed 112 workers making shorts and sweaters for export and that led importers, including Walmart, to vow to do more to ensure the safety of factories where goods they sell are manufactured. The building collapse on Wednesday quickly revived questions about the commitment of local factory owners, Bangladeshi officials and global brands to provide safe working conditions.\nThe Bangladeshi news media reported that inspection teams had discovered cracks in the structure of Rana Plaza on Tuesday. Shops and a bank branch on the lower floors immediately closed. But the owners of the garment factories on the upper floors ordered employees to work on Wednesday, despite the safety risks.\nLabor activists combed the wreckage on Wednesday afternoon and discovered labels and production records suggesting that the factories were producing garments for major European and American brands. Labels were discovered for the Spanish brand Mango, and for the low-cost British chain Primark.\nActivists said the factories also had produced clothing for Walmart, the Dutch retailer C & A, Benetton and Cato Fashions, according to customs records, factory Web sites and documents discovered in the collapsed building.\nSurvivors described a sensation akin to being in an earthquake: hearing a loud and terrifying cracking sound; feeling the concrete factory floor roll beneath their feet; and watching concrete beams and pillars collapse as the eight-story building suddenly seemed to implode.\n\u201cI heard screams,\u201d said Mahmudul Hasan, a quality inspector at Ether Tex, a garment factory, who was hit by a falling ceiling. \u201cMy heart started pounding. I lay down near a pillar and started thinking that perhaps I was going to die.\u201d\nInternational attention was focused on labor conditions in Bangladesh five months ago, with the fatal fire at Tazreen Fashions, a garment factory near Dhaka. That fire brought pledges from government officials and many global companies to tighten safety standards.\nBut on Wednesday, many labor rights advocates said the collapse of Rana Plaza showed a continued failure to take meaningful action.\n\u201cThe front-line responsibility is the government\u2019s, but the real power lies with Western brands and retailers, beginning with the biggest players: Walmart, H & M, Inditex, Gap and others,\u201d said Scott Nova, executive director of Worker Rights Consortium, a labor rights organization. \u201cThe price pressure these buyers put on factories undermines any prospect that factories will undertake the costly repairs and renovations that are necessary to make these buildings safe.\u201d\nBangladesh is the world\u2019s second-leading garment exporter, trailing only China, but the industry has been plagued by concerns over safety and angry protests over rock-bottom wages. The industry has grown rapidly in the past decade, particularly as rising wages in China have pushed many global clothing companies to look for lower costs elsewhere. Bangladesh has the lowest labor costs in the world, with the minimum wage for garment workers set at roughly $37 a month.\nSuch low labor costs have attracted not just Walmart but almost every major global clothing company, including Sears, Gap, Tommy Hilfiger and many others. Bangladesh now has more than 5,000 garment factories, employing more than 3.2 million workers, many of them women, and advocates credit the industry for lifting people out of poverty, even with such low wages. Exports also provide a critical source of foreign exchange that helps the government offset the high costs of imported oil.\nBut critics have argued that the outsize importance of the industry has made the government reluctant to take steps that could increase costs or alienate foreign brands. Labor unions are almost nonexistent, and a labor organizer, Aminul Islam, was tortured and murdered last year. The case remains unsolved. Meanwhile, some factory owners say they cannot raise wages or invest in upgrading facilities because of the low prices paid by Western brands.\nPoorly constructed buildings have long been a problem in Bangladesh. In 2005, at least 64 workers at Spectrum Garments were killed in a building collapse. Alonzo Suson, who runs an A.F.L.-C.I.O. training center in Dhaka known as the Solidarity Center, said Wednesday\u2019s accident illustrated the repeated failure of government inspectors to ensure that safety standards and building codes are met.\n\u201cIt is substandard construction, shortcut construction,\u201d Mr. Suson said. \u201cThere was already a crack in the building.\u201d\n\n13 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nOn Wednesday, a spokesman for Walmart expressed sympathy for the victims and said the global retail giant was committed to promoting stronger safety measures. \u201cWe are investigating across our global supply chain to see if a factory in this building was currently producing for Walmart,\u201d said Kevin Gardner, the company spokesman.\nOne problem exposed in the Tazreen Fashions fire was the opacity of the global supply chain for clothing. The Tazreen factory was making apparel for Walmart and Sears, but after the fire both retailers said they had not known that and accused their suppliers of secretly subcontracting the jobs.\nInside Rana Plaza, labor activists discovered a document detailing cutting specifications for an order from Benetton. Yet Luca Biondolillo, a spokesman for the Benetton Group, denied any connection to the factories in the building. \u201cNone of the companies involved are currently suppliers of Benetton Group or any of its brands,\u201d Mr. Biondolillo said.\nThe Bangladeshi prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, announced that Thursday would be a national day of mourning. Ms. Hasina, leader of the governing Awami League, could face political fallout from the accident. Rana Plaza is owned by a political figure affiliated with the Awami League.\nMr. Hasan, the quality inspector who survived the collapse, recalled a chaotic scene in which the dust was so thick that he struggled to breathe.\n\u201cI found some other colleagues around me when they were using the light of their mobile phones,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were all trapped. So we had to crawl to look for space to escape.\n\u201cWe were screaming, shouting, saying, \u2018Save me! I am here!\u2019\u00a0\u201d",

    "text": "Conservation Pays Off for Bangladeshi Factories\n2013-03-21T17:06:27.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 At the factories of DBL Group, one of the largest Bangladeshi textile and garment makers, tons of fluffy imported cotton are spun into yarn every day, then transformed into fabric and clothes sold by companies like H&M, Puma and Esprit around the world.\nOne step in the process happens in the dye house, a hangar-like factory where cloth and dye are boiled in enormous metal vats for three to seven hours. Here, the natural, off-white color of cotton cloth is transformed into vibrant hues. One recent morning, a worker guided a winch extracting freshly dyed orange cloth from a vat as steaming water cascaded to the floor.\nThe textiles industry requires large amounts of water to dye and rinse cloth, as well as steam for printing and pressing fabric.\nTo produce 35 metric tons of cloth each day, DBL uses 3,400 cubic meters, or about 900,000 gallons, of water \u2014 about 1.5 times the volume of an Olympic-size swimming pool.\nIn 2011, DBL and 17 other Bangladeshi factories upgraded equipment as part of a program backed by the aid agencies of Britain and Norway and the International Finance Corp., the World Bank unit serving the private sector.\nThe 18 Bangladeshi textile makers together invested more than $1 million to upgrade their factories, while 10 apparel buyers, including the giant retailers H&M and Tesco, contributed a total of $35,000 to the program. Solidaridad, a Dutch non-governmental organization, provided technical advice and funding.\nDBL invested $80,000 to make simple but powerful upgrades to equipment like boilers and dyeing and rinsing machines, as well as implementing simple fixes like insulating steam pipes and fixing leaks. Before the changes, DBL used 120 liters, or 32 gallons, of water to produce a kilogram, or 2.2 pounds, of cloth; now it uses 60 liters.\nIn Bangladesh, many factories use as much as 170 liters of water to make one kilogram of cloth.\nThose measures save not only water but also the electricity and gas used to pump, filter, heat and treat water, which translates into total savings of $500,000 each year for DBL.\n\u201cWe use less resources for more production,\u201d said Mohammed Jabbar, managing director of DBL. \u201cThe program really opened our minds.\u201d\nIn one year, the factories in the program together saved 1.2 million cubic meters of water, 16 million cubic meters of gas and 10 million kilowatt hours of electricity, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 32,000 tons, according to the International Finance Corp., which estimated that if half of Bangladeshi textile factories adopted similar measures, they could save $75 million, along with 63 billion liters of water and 650 million cubic meters of gas.\nConserving water is critical for Bangladesh, where a booming textile and garment industry helped the economy grow 6 percent last year. Bangladesh is now the world\u2019s second largest exporter of garments, after China, and the industry\u2019s sales are projected to grow to as much as $42 billion by 2020 from $19 billion last fiscal year, according to a report by McKinsey, the management consulting firm.\nBut fast growth means dangerous depletion of water and other resources. Bangladesh is one of the world\u2019s most densely populated countries, with 160 million people living in a space smaller than Iowa. Although much of Bangladesh lies in the delta of the Brahmaputra River, groundwater is being rapidly depleted: The water table in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, drops two meters, or more than six feet, each year.\nDBL has a multimillion-dollar effluent treatment plant, but plenty of Bangladeshi textile factories \u2014 not to mention tanneries and other industries \u2014 do not. Water full of dyes and chemicals is often dumped directly into rivers, contaminating water and killing fish and other wildlife that millions of people depend on.\nIn Bangladesh, groundwater is virtually free, so industries have little incentive to conserve it \u2014 but they want to save energy, as fuel prices remain high.\nSaving water means using less energy to heat water in gigantic boilers and to clean wastewater in treatment plants, as well as using less dye imported from Europe.\nTo persuade factories to make changes, the program compiled a report that projected significant cost savings for water, energy, dye and chemicals, and operations time. At first, \u201cmany factories did not believe the data,\u201d said Syed Nayeem Emran, a project leader with the International Finance Corp. in Dhaka.\nBut the program secured support from global clothing buyers to get factories on board. Then textile makers agreed on upgrades.\nFor instance, DBL installed sensors on dyeing and rinsing machines that automatically stop the machines when cloth is saturated or rinsed enough. It also added a magnetic device to its huge boilers to reduce mineral buildup, which decreases the need to flush equipment with water and preserves the machinery.\nGigantic rollers were adjusted to wring out rinsed fabric thoroughly, so less energy was needed for drying. Yet sensors on dryers were programmed to retain 8 percent of moisture, which is the minimum needed for the next stage of production.\nSimple fixes like insulating steam pipes, installing water meters on dyeing and rinsing machines and using hoses with nozzles instead of free-flowing ones to wash equipment, all helped save water and energy. Changing to adjustable hoses alone reduced DBL\u2019s water consumption by about 5 percent.\nThere are now plans to expand the program to provide advice to another 200 textile makers on ways to upgrade their factories. For this next phase, the Dutch government has already contributed $5.6 million and apparel buyers have put in about $3 million.\nIdeally, rinse water could eventually be filtered and reused, for example. DBL is building a rainwater harvesting system to capture water during the monsoon and make use of groundwater unnecessary for four months. And it is trying to get European companies to make dyes that work at lower temperatures.\nMr. Jabbar\u2019s eyes lit up when describing how DBL has saved money, energy and water. \u201cWe are really into it now,\u201d he said of sustainable practices. \u201cNow we know how much we are affecting the environment.\u201d",

    "text": "Putting Bangladesh on the Arts Map\n2013-12-04T14:00:37.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Bangladesh, a country ravaged in recent years by mass protests, typhoons and factory fires that killed hundreds, may seem like an unusual place for a global arts event. But an ambitious initiative driven by a local entrepreneurial couple is looking to change that. \n\u201cThis is the time for South Asia, there is huge interest, the world is looking at us,\u201d said Rajeeb Samdani, 39, a self-made businessman in Dhaka whose interest in art developed seven years ago when he met his wife, Nadia, 31. \u201cWe wanted an event that would attract people from around the world to come and see and discover artists from the region.\u201d \nThe couple, and their Samdani Art Foundation, are behind the Dhaka Art Summit, which drew 50,000 people to its inaugural event last year. The next edition, scheduled for Feb. 7 to Feb. 9, will focus on artists from South Asia and seeks to increase the visibility of Bangladesh and the region on the global arts radar.\nArt from India, and to a lesser extent Pakistan, tends to attract the most attention in the region, but artists from other nations are also drawing notice. Global interest in Bangladeshi art is growing, Amin Jaffer, international director of Asian Art for Christie\u2019s said by email, and \u201cthe Samdanis have shown a huge commitment to fostering the arts in Bangladesh and raising its profile internationally.\u201d \nJessica Morgan, a curator of international art at the Tate Modern in London, agreed. \u201cThe summit is a remarkably swift and impressive development in Dhaka,\u201d she said by email, \u201cproviding a platform for key voices and creative minds in the region.\u201d \nThe event will include 250 artists, all from South Asia, and 32 local and foreign galleries. Fourteen solo art projects curated by Diana Campbell Betancourt, artistic director of the Samdani Art Foundation, will feature works by Rana Begum, Tayeba Begum Lipi, Runa Islam, Naeem Mohaiemen and Mahbubur Rahman, all of Bangladeshi origin. But Afghanistan is also represented in the series (Lida Abdul), as are Pakistan (Rashid Rana and Shahzia Sikander), Nepal (Ang Tsherin Sherpa) and India (Jitish Kallat, Shilpa Gupta, Asim Waqif, Rathin Barman and Mithu Sen).\nThe lineup also includes experimental films and performance art curated by Mahbubur Rahman, a public art initiative by the New Delhi-based Raqs Media Collective, and talks and panel discussions by art experts from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, the British Museum and Tate Modern in London, the Centre Pompidou in Paris and Khoj in New Delhi. An art award for young Bangladeshi artists will be judged by an international jury including Aaron Cezar of the Delfina Foundation in London and the Brazilian curator Adriano Pedrosa.\nAs global interest in South Asia deepens, Mr. Jaffer observed, events like the one in Dhaka are drawing an increasing number of international collectors, museums, galleries and auction houses to the region, including some notable names. At last year\u2019s event, the Guggenheim acquired Tayeba Begum Lipi\u2019s stainless steel and razor blade sculpture \u201cLove Bed,\u201d which the museum included in its \u201cNo Country: Contemporary Art for South and Southeast Asia\u201d exhibition this year.\nMr. Samdani, who runs Golden Harvest, a multimillion dollar conglomerate with interests in information technology, food, insurance and real estate, described the event as a \u201cfestival, not an art fair,\u201d because it does not have a commercial focus. \nMs. Betancourt concurred. Citing the example of Indian artists like Mithu Sen and Shilpa Gupta, she said that the artists commissioned to make works for the event were given resources and grants but were not expected to run their works by the Samdanis. \u201cTo find patrons who will fund an idea without having to see an end product is unique in this part of the world,\u201d she said. Artists commissioned to do the solo works will also retain ownership of those works. \nMs. Samdani estimates that she and her husband have more than 2,000 artworks, 70 percent of which are by Bangladeshi artists. (The collection is \u201cnot properly archived,\u201d she notes ruefully.) They began their personal collecting journey by buying local art, eventually branching out to modern and contemporary art from around the world, with pieces by Tracey Emin, Damien Hirst, Marc Quinn and Ai Weiwei. \u201cWhy should art have a nationality?\u201d Mr. Samdani asked.\nThat question might apply to individual artists themselves, including the 43-year-old Ms. Islam, a Dhaka-born, London-bred artist. The White Cube gallery will show in Dhaka a 2008 film, \u201cUntitled (After the Hunt)\u201d that touches on her fragmented relationship with Bangladesh.\nMs. Begum, 36, another Anglo-Bangladeshi artist, will show a solo project that draws on her experience of weaving baskets as a child and of reading the Quran in a small mosque in her native village. \u201cI am fascinated by architectural spaces, how they play with natural light and how it affects the viewer,\u201d Ms. Begum said by email. \u201cWith the use of unfinished baskets I am hoping to create a space that immerses the viewer in a play between light and shadow.\u201d\nMs. Sikander, a Pakistani-American artist whose 2013 audiovisual work \u201cParallax\u201d was shown at the Sharjah Biennial in the United Arab Emirates this year and will be on display at the Dhaka event, said that she appreciated having an opportunity to exhibit in the region. \n\u201cThe Samdanis\u2019 idea about supporting work from the region and not just from Bangladesh demonstrates an interest in breaking barriers between countries,\u201d she said by email. \u201cArt is one of the only platforms in South Asia where these divides are being dismantled.\u201d",

    "text": "Report on Deadly Factory Collapse in Bangladesh Finds Widespread Blame\n2013-05-22T19:52:15.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 A factory building that collapsed last month outside Dhaka, killing more than 1,000 workers in the deadliest disaster in the history of the garment industry, was constructed with substandard materials and in blatant disregard for building codes, a high-level government report issued Wednesday concluded.\nThe 400-page report on the collapse of the Rana Plaza building in Savar, an industrial suburb of Dhaka, the capital, found widespread fault for the April 24 disaster, which killed 1,127 people. It blamed the mayor for wrongly granting construction approvals and recommended charges against the building\u2019s owner, Sohel Rana, and the owners of the five garment factories in the building that could result in life sentences if they are convicted.\nThe factory owners urged workers to return to their jobs despite evidence that the building was unsafe, the report said. \u201cThey compelled them to start,\u201d said Main Uddin Khandaker, a high-ranking official in Bangladesh\u2019s Home Ministry, who led the investigation.\n\n21 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nThe Rana Plaza disaster has focused global attention on unsafe conditions in the garment industry in Bangladesh, which is the world\u2019s second-leading exporter of clothing, trailing only China. Bangladesh has more than 5,000 garment factories, handling orders for nearly all of the world\u2019s top brands and retailers. It has become an export powerhouse largely by delivering lower costs, in part by having the lowest wages in the world for garment workers.\nRana Plaza was a disaster waiting to happen, the government report suggested. Mr. Rana illegally constructed upper floors to house garment factories employing several thousand workers, it said. Large power generators placed on these upper floors, necessary because of regular power failures, would shake the poorly constructed building whenever they were switched on, according to the report.\nOn April 23, cracks appeared in the building, shaking the structure enough that many workers fled. An engineer who had been called to inspect the structure warned that it was unsafe. Yet Mr. Rana and the factory bosses discounted any concerns and ordered their workers into the building the next morning, the report concluded. A generator soon switched on, and the building buckled and collapsed.\nMr. Khandaker\u2019s report recommended that Mr. Rana and the factory owners be charged with culpable homicide. He also suggested that Mr. Rana had bribed local officials for construction approvals.",

    "text": "Death Toll in Bangladesh Building Collapse Tops 500\n2013-05-03T20:42:34.000Z\nSAVAR, Bangladesh \u2014 The death toll in the Rana Plaza disaster soared to 517 on Friday, as rescue crews spent a 10th day digging through the rubble and investigators continued to interrogate the building\u2019s owner and others arrested in the case.\nThe collapse of the Rana Plaza building, which housed five clothing factories, is the deadliest disaster in the history of the garment industry, with the death toll likely to keep rising as work crews now use heavy machinery to clear debris from some of the most devastated sections of the building.\nThousands of onlookers visit the wreckage daily, including some bearing small posters with photographs of loved ones still unaccounted for. On Friday, Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir, Bangladesh\u2019s home minister, said more arrests were possible in coming days.\n\u201cThis is a case of sheer negligence and sheer arrogance,\u201d Mr. Alamgir said in an interview. \u201cArrogance on the part of the owner and negligence by the engineers and the local government authorities.\u201d\nThe police have already arrested the building\u2019s owner, Sohel Rana, the owners of four of the factories and three engineers.\nThe mayor of Savar has been suspended for granting permits for the construction of the building.\nThe arrest on Thursday of one of the engineers, Abdur Razzaque Khan, was a surprise, because Mr. Khan had been praised for trying to persuade the owner to close the building a day before it collapsed, warning that it was unsafe.\nThe police initially said they arrested Mr. Khan because they wanted to interrogate him about accusations by Mr. Rana and the factory owners, who had blamed the engineer for reassuring them that the building was not at risk.\nBut on Friday, Mr. Alamgir said the engineer was accused of helping to plan and approve three upper floors of the building that had been added illegally in recent years.\nEven as work crews continue to look for bodies in the wreckage, Abul Maal Abdul Muhith, the country\u2019s finance minister, made ill-timed remarks during a visit to New Delhi, predicting that the disaster would not slow down the country\u2019s garment industry.\n\u201cThe present difficulties, well, I don\u2019t think it is really serious. It\u2019s an accident,\u201d he said, according to The Associated Press. \u201cAnd the steps that we have taken in order to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen, they are quite elaborate and I believe that it will be appreciated by all.\u201d",

    "text": "The Most Hated Bangladeshi, Toppled From a Shady Empire\n2013-05-01T01:47:03.000Z\nSAVAR, Bangladesh \u2014 Barely 20 miles from the national capital, this gritty suburb is now a dusty, chaotic industrial center littered with factories that produce clothes for leading Western brands. Building codes are often unenforced, regulatory oversight is flimsy and the men wielding power often travel with armed guards.\nAnd perhaps no one wielded power more brazenly than Sohel Rana. He traveled by motorcycle, as untouchable as a mafia don, trailed by his own biker gang. Local officials and the Bangladeshi news media say he was involved in illegal drugs and guns, but he also had a building, Rana Plaza, that housed five factories.\nUpstairs, workers earned as little as $40 a month making clothes for retailers like J. C. Penney. Downstairs, Mr. Rana hosted local politicians, playing pool, drinking and, the officials say, indulging in drugs.\nNow Mr. Rana, 35, is under arrest, the most reviled man in Bangladesh after the horrific collapse of Rana Plaza last week left nearly 400 people dead, with many others still missing. On Tuesday, a top Bangladeshi court seized his assets, as the public bayed for his execution, especially as it appears that the tragedy could have been averted if the frantic warnings of an engineer who examined the building the day before had been heeded.\nBut if Mr. Rana has been vilified, he is partly a creation of the garment era in Bangladesh, during which global businesses have arrived in search of cheap labor to keep profits high and costs low. Directly or indirectly, international brands are now sometimes interlinked with men like Mr. Rana, and placed at risk by them.\nGlobal apparel companies often depict their international supply chains as tightly scrutinized systems to ensure that clothing sold to American buyers is produced in safe, monitored factories. Yet their inspectors usually check safety factors and working conditions, but not the soundness of the buildings themselves, and the companies often have little control over the subcontractors who do much of the work.\nCriminality and politics have long intersected in Bangladesh, especially at the local level. But the garment industry has introduced what had mostly been the missing element: money. Savar land values soared as new factories hurriedly opened to meet the new Western demand.\nTo build Rana Plaza, Mr. Rana and his father bullied adjacent landowners, the landowners themselves say, and ultimately took their property by force. His political allies gave him a construction permit, despite his dubious claims of title to the land, and a second permit later to add upper floors that may have destabilized the building.\nMr. Rana existed largely above scrutiny. Many local people say his political clout was such that not even the police dared to confront him. Television stations reported the cracks in the building the night before it collapsed, but no local authority prevented Mr. Rana from opening the building the next morning.\n\u201cMoney is his power,\u201d said Ashraf Uddin Khan, a former mayor of Savar, who accused Mr. Rana of being deeply involved in the drug trade. \u201cIllegal money.\u201d\nBefore Rana Plaza collapsed, Bangladesh was already in turmoil, as opposition political parties were staging nationwide strikes, known as hartals, that paralyzed the country and placed huge pressure on factory owners to meet deadlines. Weeks earlier, the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association warned that the hartals had cost Bangladesh as much as $500 million in business.\nHartals were part of Mr. Rana\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9. He held what appeared to be an innocuous position as secretary of the local student wing for the Awami League, the country\u2019s majority political party. But that position translated into influence and helped him mobilize people. He developed a following that local people say he used as political muscle, sometimes to enforce strikes, sometimes to defy them.\n\u201cHe had a criminal gang,\u201d said Mohammed Khorshed Alam, an elected councilman in Savar and a member of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party. He said Mr. Rana and his men carried weapons and were part of a network involved in the local drug trade.\nPolitics are rough in Savar. Mr. Alam walks through the city with an entourage of eight men, including a bodyguard with a sawed-off shotgun. Local officials say drug sales are widespread, though the city\u2019s police chief says he has stamped out the problem. One of the busiest drug dens, he said, used to exist behind Rana Plaza.\nLand helped create Mr. Rana\u2019s power. His father had been a poor peasant who sold his plot in a village and bought a small parcel in Savar. As prices began to rise, the father sold a portion of that land and used his profits to start a small factory making mustard oil. He also became involved in politics with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, then in power, and slowly grew richer.\nBy 2000, land prices were rising, and Mr. Rana was helping his father. They could see other hurriedly constructed buildings rising in Savar, and they decided to build Rana Plaza \u2014 except they did not have clear title to all the land.\nRabindranath Sarkar, who had bought land in partnership with Mr. Rana\u2019s father, said the family sent thugs to seize part of his share of the land and then retaliated when he filed a complaint with the local police.\n\u201cRana chased me through Savar with weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cThe police wouldn\u2019t even dare to protect me. The police were always scared of them.\u201d\nAnother adjacent family said Mr. Rana sent representatives to try to persuade them to sell a plot, including a small pond, beside Mr. Rana\u2019s land. By 2005, a year before construction started on Rana Plaza, the family said Mr. Rana simply falsified a land deed to take possession of the pond.\nBangladesh initially sought to attract foreign investment by creating special Export Processing Zones, which had higher quality buildings and tighter regulations. But as demand from foreign buyers rose, factories began sprouting across the country, including quickly built structures to accommodate the small operators who did subcontract work on tight margins.\nBy 2011, Mr. Rana had rented out the existing five floors and gotten a permit from the local mayor, a political ally, to build additional floors. Mr. Khan, the former mayor, said this practice created serious risks, since officials were handing out permits, often for bribes, without insisting on the necessary safeguards.\n\u201cFor the garment industry, Savar grew quickly, and in an unplanned manner,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many buildings like Rana Plaza in Savar.\u201d\nMr. Rana found factory owners to rent his new upper floors and appeared to be gaining in influence. Then on April 23, a problem arose. Workers on the third floor were stitching clothing when they were startled by a noise that sounded like an explosion. Cracks had appeared in the building. Workers rushed outside in terror.\nBy late morning, Mr. Rana\u2019s representatives had brought in Abdur Razzaque Khan, an engineer. Taken to the third floor, Mr. Khan examined three support pillars, and became horrified at the cracks he found.\n\u201cI became scared,\u201d Mr. Khan said. \u201cIt was not safe to stay inside this building.\u201d\nHe rushed downstairs and told one of Mr. Rana\u2019s administrators that the building needed to be closed immediately. But Mr. Rana was apparently not impressed; he was holding court with about a dozen local journalists.\n\u201cThis is not a crack,\u201d he said, according to Shamim Hossain, a local newspaper reporter. \u201cThe plaster on the wall is broken, nothing more. It is not a problem.\u201d\nBut it was. The next morning, Rana Plaza collapsed. Mr. Rana managed to escape from his basement office, but was eventually discovered hiding near the Indian border. He was flown by helicopter to Dhaka and thrust before the news media, looking dazed and disheveled.\nNeither Mr. Rana nor a representative was available for comment. He has previously said it was the factory owners who insisted on opening for business the day of the collapse, and several of the owners have been arrested, as was Mr. Rana\u2019s father.\nEven now, many people in Savar remained unconvinced that Mr. Rana will be punished, or that his style of business will be cleaned up. \u201cRana is not the only one,\u201d said Mr. Sarkar, the man whose land was taken. \u201cNow, we have so many Ranas.\u201d",

    "text": "Justice Still Elusive \nin Factory Disasters \nin Bangladesh\n2013-06-29T23:10:36.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Inside Courtroom 21, the two judges peered down from high wooden chairs as lawyers in formal black robes presented their motions. Activists and victims watched from the back. And a few steps away, a portly man with a thick black beard remained silent. He was the suspect. He did not seem especially nervous.\nPerhaps that is because the man, Delowar Hossain, has not yet been charged with anything \u2014 and may never be. He has been a vilified figure since his garment factory, Tazreen Fashions, caught fire last November, killing 112 workers who were making clothes for retailers like Walmart and Sears. A high-level government investigation found fire safety violations and accused Mr. Hossain of \u201cunpardonable negligence.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you sleep at night?\u201d a woman screamed as Mr. Hossain left the courtroom after the hearing on June 19. The more pertinent question might be this: In Bangladesh, where the garment industry powers the economy and wields enormous political clout, is it possible to hold factory owners like Mr. Hossain accountable?\nNow is undeniably the test. The Tazreen Fashions fire was followed by the April collapse of the Rana Plaza factory building, in which 1,129 people were killed in the deadliest disaster in the history of the garment industry. A global supply chain that delivers low-cost clothes from Bangladeshi factories to stores in the West was suddenly redefined by images of mutilated bodies pulled from the rubble. The Obama administration responded last week by rescinding a special trade privilege for Bangladesh over concerns about safety problems and labor rights violations in its garment industry.\nBut Bangladeshi factories have always suffered fires and accidents, usually without attracting international attention. One study estimated that more than 1,000 workers died in hundreds of factory fires or accidents from 1990 to 2012. Not once was a factory owner charged with any crime, activists say.\n\u201cWe want to set a legal precedent that factory owners can\u2019t get away with this,\u201d said Saydia Gulrukh, an anthropologist and social activist.\nOne way to interpret the hearing for Mr. Hossain was as an act of exasperation. It was not a criminal trial. Instead, Ms. Gulrukh and a handful of other activists and lawyers had become so frustrated that they petitioned the Bangladesh High Court to overstep the stalled police investigation and decide whether criminal charges should be filed. The proceeding is already bogged down and could take months, or longer.\n\u201cThey are just delaying the process,\u201d said Jyotirmoy Barua, the lawyer handling the petition, speaking of Mr. Hossain\u2019s defense team. \u201cThey think we will lose the spirit of fighting. But they have miscalculated.\u201d\nBangladesh\u2019s legal system has rarely favored anyone confronting the power structure. Much of the legal code has remained intact since the British imperial era, when laws were devised to control the population and protect the colonialist power structure. Legal reformers continue to push to modernize the criminal code, but the pace of change has been slow. Moreover, the police and other security forces are deeply politicized, with a bloody legacy of carrying out extrajudicial killings.\nMany garment factory owners are now entrenched in the nation\u2019s power elite, some as members of Parliament. Garments represent 80 percent of the country\u2019s manufacturing exports, giving the industry vast economic power, while factory owners also finance campaigns during national elections, giving them broad political influence.\nThe April 24 collapse of Rana Plaza, located in Savar, an industrial suburb of Dhaka, seemed to shock a system often inured to factory accidents. On the morning of the collapse, factory workers had been ordered into the building, even though cracks had appeared a day earlier and an engineer had warned that the structure was unsafe. The building\u2019s owner, Sohel Rana, disappeared amid speculation that he would avoid prosecution because he was affiliated with the governing political coalition, the Awami League.\nBut incensed High Court judges ordered the police to arrest Mr. Rana, as well as the owners of the garment factories inside the building. Mr. Rana was hauled into the courthouse, along with the factory bosses, surprising some legal activists who could not remember a single case in which judges had taken such action against members of the garment industry.\n\u201cThat was very unusual,\u201d said Sara Hossain, a Supreme Court lawyer and legal activist, who is not related to Delowar Hossain. \u201cI think it was only possible because of the level of national and international outrage.\u201d\nMs. Hossain has fought the garment industry for years over the 2005 collapse of the Spectrum sweater factory in Savar, in which at least 64 workers died. Soon after the collapse, she and other lawyers petitioned the court and pressed for affidavits from different agencies to determine who was to blame, in hopes of stirring a prosecution.\nBut years passed without any action until, in 2009, government lawyers announced that the court file had been lost. Hearings kept getting postponed, she said, as court officials kept saying the file was lost. Then, after the Rana Plaza collapse, Ms. Hossain won another hearing. The judges suddenly seemed animated as she asked for a formal investigation into the missing file.\n\u201cThe next day, we went to court and the file reappeared,\u201d she said.\nInside the file were dusty affidavits, including one from the agency that regulated construction projects in Savar. It warned that Savar and other areas had many hazardous buildings and recommended forming a task force to investigate. It was dated 2006, the year construction began on Rana Plaza. \u201cIf that report had been acted upon and seen the light of day,\u201d she said, \u201csurely you could have avoided Rana Plaza.\u201d\nNow, the lawyers trying to bring charges against Mr. Hossain, the owner of Tazreen Fashions, are facing their own obstacles. First, they sought a copy of the government investigation that had blamed Mr. Hossain for negligence. Though reporters were briefed on the main findings last December, the investigation report was never publicly released. But at one hearing, government lawyers said the Home Ministry had not yet provided them with a copy.\nOn June 19, the two-judge panel seemed annoyed when the government lawyers again failed to properly file the report with the court. (They did so later in the day.) When one of the judges, Quazi Reza-ul Hoque, expressed interest in broadening the case, the main defense lawyer stepped to the lectern, agreeing that the failings of the government should also be explored, but also adding a reminder about the garment industry.\n\u201cThis is a very important economic factor in our country,\u201d said the lawyer, Fida M. Kamal. When he raised the same point a few moments later, one of the judges agreed.\n\u201cWe have to keep that always in mind,\u201d Judge Hoque said.\nIn the days after the Tazreen Fashions fire, evidence of negligence mounted: the factory did not have a current fire safety license; the blaze had started in an illegal ground floor storage area filled with flammable fabric; some managers had ordered workers to ignore a fire alarm while others had locked metal gates, blocking some of the staircases.\nThe police arrested a few factory managers but took no action against Mr. Hossain, even as families of victims called for murder charges. Investigators initially questioned whether the fire was caused by sabotage, though the country\u2019s home minister later discounted that claim, but he also said that arresting Mr. Hossain was not necessary.\nIn court this month, Mr. Hossain and his lawyer refused to comment. A few men stood silently near the owner in the rear of the small room. One of them, Motiqul Islam Matin, had lost his sister in the Tazreen Fashions fire. She had called him from the fourth floor, shrieking, saying she was trapped because her managers had locked the metal gates.\nLast month, Mr. Matin filed a court petition, seeking murder charges against Mr. Hossain. Soon after, he said he began getting telephone calls. \u201cThey wanted to know where I lived,\u201d he said. \u201cI was scared. I did not tell them. I went into hiding.\u201d\nAnother man in the courtroom, Mohammad Abdul Jabbar, carried a photograph of his wife and infant son. His wife had died on the fourth floor. He had tried in vain to seek compensation or government help and now said he only wanted to see Mr. Hossain convicted.\n\u201cI want justice,\u201d he said after the hearing. \u201cThe whole system favors men like Delowar. He is a rich man. He is getting protection from the people who are supposed to listen to our voices.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cWherever I go, officials tell me to go somewhere else.\u201d",

    "text": "Grim Task of Identifying Factories\u2019 Dead Overwhelms Bangladeshi Lab\n2013-05-31T00:50:33.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Inside a small government laboratory here, there are about 300 test tubes, each labeled with masking tape and containing an extracted tooth or a shard of bone. Day and night, dozens of these tubes rest on metal trays that vibrate with a motorized monotony. The shaking decalcifies the bone in a process that requires two weeks before material can be gleaned for a DNA profile.\nOutside the laboratory, people are waiting. There are at least 301 unidentified victims of last month\u2019s horrific collapse of the Rana Plaza factory building. Those test tubes represent the only chance of identifying them. More than 500 people have given blood samples in the hopes of finding a DNA match. On a recent morning, Hasibul Islam Reaz, 10, placed a spindly arm before a needle, his eyes widening as his blood drained through a thin tube into a syringe.\n\u201cIf I give them blood,\u201d the boy said softly, \u201cI will learn where my father is, which body is his.\u201d\nFirst came the frantic search for survivors after Rana Plaza collapsed on April 24. Then came the grueling recovery of victims, with a death toll now at 1,129, the deadliest disaster in the history of the garment industry. Now, with the wreckage cleared, the slow, painstaking process of identifying bodies has become a wrenching exercise, bringing accusations of cover-ups, even as many families struggle to find loved ones and qualify for government compensation.\nWith its venomous politics and blood-soaked history, Bangladesh is rife with conspiracy theories under normal circumstances. In the Rana Plaza collapse, opposition leaders have claimed \u2014 without substantiation \u2014 that the government has hidden bodies. Activists have accused the government and industry leaders of intentionally stalling promised compensation payments to survivors and families of the dead.\nThe anger and controversy have only intensified the pressure on the small staff of the country\u2019s National Forensic DNA Profiling Laboratory. Founded in 2006 with a grant from the Danish Embassy, the lab is now overwhelmed. Completing the DNA profiles could take months. New machines are needed to decalcify the bone samples. Approval is still pending for expensive software capable of sorting through the tens of thousands of possible DNA matches.\n\u201cTo handle normal situations, the lab is O.K.,\u201d said Sharif Akhteruzzaman, who oversees operations there. \u201cBut now a whole year\u2019s caseload has come up, all of a sudden.\u201d\nFrom the moment Rana Plaza collapsed, the scale of the disaster outstripped the capacities of the Bangladeshi government. In the initial days, as dozens of bodies were being pulled hourly from the wreckage, a nearby high school served as a staging area for thousands of people looking for missing relatives or just gawking. Bodies were placed in plank coffins and sprayed with disinfectant as lines of people walked slowly past.\nShaikh Yusuf Harun, deputy commissioner for the district of Dhaka, said the chaos of the moment inevitably led to confusion \u2014 and some mistakes. Initially, 291 bodies could not be identified. Officials have also since discovered that 10 bodies were mistakenly turned over to the wrong families and buried in distant villages. In three of those cases, families later discovered that their missing relatives were alive, while in the other seven, remains were simply handed over to the wrong people. There are plans to exhume the bodies and take bone or teeth samples.\nSome opportunists took advantage of the tumult. With the huge crowds and local reporters pressing forward, officials were sometimes reluctant to challenge someone who claimed a body. In at least two cases, officials handed over bodies as well as initial payments of 20,000 taka, or about $250, to people who pocketed the cash and dumped the corpses at the edge of the school grounds.\n\u201cIt was a crisis,\u201d Mr. Harun said. \u201cThere could have been a riot. Some officials had to hand over a body.\u201d\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina has announced a compensation package for families of those killed at Rana Plaza that could exceed $12,000, with the money coming from public and private sources. The amount is substantial, given that the minimum wage in the garment industry is $37 a month. Yet so far, only 150 families have received the first installment of about $1,100, according to Mr. Harun, prompting criticism that the government is purposely making it difficult for people to claim the money.\nSuch disputes over compensation are still dragging on from the fire in November that destroyed the Tazreen Fashions garment factory and killed 112 workers who had been making clothing for brands that included Walmart and Sears. One problem for families is merely proving that a relative worked in a factory: at Tazreen, just outside Dhaka, the flames that consumed many victims also destroyed their identification tags. And in the Rana Plaza collapse, rumors have swirled of bodies disappearing after being whisked away in trucks, prompting the leader of the political opposition to accuse the government of a cover-up.\n\u201cIn Rana Plaza, we suspect the death toll is much higher,\u201d said Jyotirmoy Barua, a lawyer who has been working with victims of the Tazreen Fashions and Rana Plaza disasters. \u201cThe only reason for lowering the number is to lower the compensation.\u201d\nBut such accusations have been sharply rebutted by the government, and many others note that any coordinated effort to hide bodies would have been difficult, given the thousands of people who had rushed to the disaster site, including dozens of journalists filming every development.\n\u201cIt was not possible,\u201d Mr. Harun said of the rumors. \u201cIt is totally baseless.\u201d\nOne reason for the slow distribution of compensation is that officials say they are struggling in some cases to determine who the rightful claimants are. Most garment workers migrated to the Dhaka region from rural villages. They often supported a spouse and children, and they also sent back money to help their parents.\nNow, with the deaths of so many breadwinners, some families are desperate and fighting over the compensation. Mr. Harun said one woman, three months pregnant, lost her husband in the Rana Plaza collapse. She was given his body and his official documents, only to see his parents snatch the documents and make a claim for compensation.\n\u201cThere are so many cases like this,\u201d Mr. Harun said. \u201cWe need to sort them out individually.\u201d\nAt the DNA laboratory, Mr. Akhteruzzaman said his staff needed two or three months to begin making matches. Ordinarily, scientists can collect tissue soon after a victim\u2019s death and produce a DNA profile within hours. But most of the bodies from Rana Plaza were recovered days or weeks after the building collapsed, too late to collect usable samples, so bone shards or teeth were taken instead.\nBone must be decalcified before any usable material can be collected, a process that takes two weeks per sample. Usually, the small shaking machines are equipped to handle 15 sample test tubes at a time; now, the test tubes are stacked in groups of 30. When that process is completed, Mr. Akhteruzzaman said, the lab must buy software similar to that used after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, with the capacity of sorting through so many possible combinations.\nEven then, some victims will probably never be identified. \u201cIn every disaster, that is the case,\u201d Mr. Akhteruzzaman said. \u201cYou cannot find all the people.\u201d\nHasibul, the boy looking for his father, lives in Magura, a village in the northern tier of the country. In 2011, his father, Asadur Zaman, started working as a security guard at Ether Tex, a fifth-floor garment factory in Rana Plaza. He visited Magura twice a year, and his wife and young son made occasional trips to see him. When the building collapsed, Mr. Zaman\u2019s family assumed he was inside: one of his responsibilities was to unlock the factory so that workers could enter.\nTo make a DNA match, officials suggested that either Mr. Zaman\u2019s mother or father provide a blood sample. But his mother had died recently, and his father had a breakdown after hearing about the building collapse. So Hasibul stepped forward, escorted by his uncle, who said the family\u2019s future depended on proving a DNA match.\n\u201cNow they have a terrible life,\u201d said the uncle, Tariqul Islam. \u201cThey have no other source of income. The prime minister announced she would give compensation to all the victims. But if we don\u2019t have any official proof, we will not get any compensation.\u201d",

    "text": "Under Pressure, Bangladesh Adopts New Labor Law\n2013-07-17T02:14:41.000Z\nFacing intense international pressure to improve conditions for garment workers, Bangladeshi lawmakers amended the country\u2019s labor law this week. But while the officials called the new law a landmark strengthening of workers\u2019 protections, rights groups said the law made only modest changes and took numerous steps backward that undercut unions.\nBangladeshi lawmakers adopted the new law three weeks after the United States suspended Bangladesh\u2019s trade preferences, saying that labor rights and safety violations were far too prevalent in that country\u2019s factories. Moreover, the European Union has threatened to revoke Bangladesh\u2019s trade privileges for similar reasons.\nSpeaking about the new law, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, the chairman of the parliamentary subcommittee on labor reforms, told Reuters: \u201cThe aim was to ensure workers\u2019 rights are strengthened, and we have done that. I am hoping this will assuage global fears around this issue.\u201d \nThe Bangladeshi government has faced fierce pressure to improve conditions for the nation\u2019s four million garment workers since the Rana Plaza factory building collapsed in April, killing 1,129 workers.\nUnder the new law, factories will be required to set aside 5 percent of profits for a welfare fund for employees, although the law exempts export-oriented factories. Apparel is Bangladesh\u2019s dominant industry, with $18 billion in annual exports, making it the world\u2019s second-largest garment exporter after China.\nAs under the old law, workers hoping to form a union must gather signatures of 30 percent of a company\u2019s workers \u2014 a level that was onerous, labor leaders said, because many apparel manufacturers have thousands of workers. To make unionizing easier, labor leaders were urging lawmakers to adopt a 10 percent threshold. In Bangladesh, several unions might represent employees in a single factory.\nBusiness leaders complain that Bangladeshi unions are highly political and sometimes stage disruptive strikes as a complementary tactic to political blocs\u2019 lobbying and infighting. \nIn a step that could help unionization, the new law bars the country\u2019s labor ministry from giving factory owners the list of the 30 percent of workers who want to form a union. Labor leaders said that after receiving those lists, owners often fired union supporters or pressed many to withdraw their names from the petition, bringing the number below the requisite 30 percent mark for a union to be recognized.\nSome labor leaders expressed concern that government officials would still give the names to factory owners, perhaps because of collusion or bribes.\n\u201cThe government says this will make it easier for workers to organize,\u201d said Babul Akhter, the president of the Bangladesh Garment and Industrial Workers Federation. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d\nMr. Akhter praised the legislation for adding some protections on fire and building safety: it strengthens requirements for permits when a factory adds floors. \nHuman Rights Watch said, however, that the new law would make unionizing harder. It criticized the legislation for adding more industrial sectors, including hospitals, where workers would not be permitted to form unions. The group noted that workers in Bangladesh\u2019s important export processing zones would remain legally unable to unionize.\nIn addition, the government would be empowered to stop a strike if it would cause \u201cserious hardship to the community\u201d or be \u201cprejudicial to the national interest.\u201d And workers at any factory owned by foreigners or established in collaboration with foreigners would be barred from striking during the operation\u2019s first three years.\n\u201cThe Bangladesh government desperately wants to move the spotlight away from the Rana Plaza disaster, so it\u2019s not surprising it is now trying to show that it belatedly cares about workers\u2019 rights,\u201d said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch. \u201cThis would be good news if the new law fully met international standards, but the sad reality is that the government has consciously limited basic workers\u2019 rights while exposing workers to continued risks and exploitation.\u201d \nUnder the new law, unions would need government approval before they could receive technical, health, safety or financial support from other countries.\nAn Obama administration official said various agencies were seeking to obtain the exact language of the new law in order to study it. \nRoy Ramesh Chandra, a powerful Bangladeshi labor leader, said the legislation might not have done enough to persuade Europe not to suspend trade preferences or to get Washington to reinstate such preferences.",

    "text": "Tears and Rage as Hope Fades in Bangladesh\n2013-04-29T00:27:00.000Z\nSAVAR, Bangladesh \u2014 The mother stood at the edge of the wreckage, pressing her lips to photos of her two children \u2014 Asma, who had worked in a garment factory on the fourth floor, and Sultan, who worked on the fifth.\nFor five days after the building collapsed, rescue teams had retrieved corpses and survivors, but not her son and daughter. Tears on her cheeks, she began to shout: at a soldier sweating beneath a hard hat, at the shattered building, at her god, and finally at her children, calling out their names, beckoning to them, \u201cToday, I\u2019m here! But you haven\u2019t come back!\u201d\nThousands of people surrounded the site on Sunday, watching the huge rescue operation, even as hopes faded that many more victims would be found alive. For nearly 12 hours, rescuers tried to save a trapped woman, lowering dry food and juice to her as they carefully cut through the wreckage trying to reach her. But then a fire broke out, apparently killing the woman, leaving many firefighters in tears.\nWith national outrage boiling over, Bangladeshi paramilitary officers tracked down and arrested Sohel Rana, the owner of the building, who was hiding near the Indian border, and returned him by helicopter to Dhaka. When loudspeakers at the rescue site announced his capture earlier in the day, local news reports said, the crowd broke out in cheers.\nThe collapse of the building, the Rana Plaza, is considered the deadliest accident in the history of the garment industry. It is known to have claimed at least 377 lives, and hundreds more workers are thought to be missing still, buried in the rubble.\nThe Rana Plaza building contained five garment factories, employing more than 3,000 workers, who were making clothing for European and American consumers. Labor activists, citing customs records, company Web sites or labels discovered in the wreckage, say that the factories produced clothing for JC Penney; Cato Fashions; Benetton; Primark, the low-cost British store chain; and other retailers.\nEverywhere near the building, the stench of death was overpowering. Men in surgical masks sprayed disinfectant in the air. Others sprayed air freshener. At one point, the police said, searches inside the structure were suspended because some rescuers were overcome by dust and the odor of decomposing bodies.\nSavar is a crowded industrial suburb of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, and the disaster has overwhelmed local institutions. A high school near Rana Plaza is now a staging ground for the identification of corpses. Nazma Begum, 25, stood beside a crude coffin that contained the remains of her sister, Shamima. She was standing guard over it until her father arrived to take the sister back to their home village to be buried. Sticks of burning incense had been wedged into the coffin to fight the awful smell.\n\u201cI had hoped that my sister was still alive,\u201d she said softly. \u201cBut that hope is now shattered.\u201d\nLike so many young women in the country, the two sisters had gotten work in garment factories to help support their families. Ms. Begum makes about $85 a month; her sister made $56. Now Ms. Begum wants to quit her job. She has heard rumors that the building where she works is unsafe.\nJust then a group of young men placed another coffin nearby, slid open the wooden lid and sprayed the body with disinfectant. A man on a megaphone made an announcement: \u201cWe have a new body,\u201d he said, as a crowd surged toward the coffin. \u201cYou can come and see the body to identify it.\u201d\nFor days, rescuers crawled though pancaked spaces on their hands and knees, afraid that using heavy machinery would collapse the building further. Lowered precariously into holes, they called out through the rubble and the darkness, listening for the voices of survivors. Many were saved in the painstaking process.\n\u201cWe were shouting, asking if anyone was alive,\u201d said Sharif ul-Islam, 35, a firefighter. \u201cWe would say, \u2018If anyone is alive, please make a sound! We will come to you!\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nFinding and identifying all the missing may take weeks or longer. Thousands of homemade posters for missing loved ones have been affixed to the walls outside the school, to nearby buildings, to the branches of trees, to the gate of Enam Medical College and Hospital, where so many victims are being treated.\nThe posters have a poignant similarity: One husband, Mohammed Siddique, is looking for his wife, Shahida Akter. She is smiling in her photograph, posing with a cellphone. Another husband is looking for Alpana Rani. She is smiling in her photograph, too, holding her daughter.\nIn his ground-floor office, the director of Enam Hospital, Dr. Mohammed Anawarul Quader Nazim, said that more than 650 survivors had been brought in since the Wednesday morning disaster. The scope of injuries was horrifying: fractured skulls, crushed rib cages, severed livers, ruptured spleens. One survivor lost both legs. So many people suffered crushed limbs that his hospital sent a medical team to the wreckage to help handle on-site amputations. He keeps a list of amputees on his desk: A teenage girl named Sania lost her right leg. Another teenager, Anna, lost her right hand.\nUpstairs in the Intensive Care Unit, Laboni Khanam, 22, lay in a bed, dazed. She was rescued after being trapped for 36 hours, but to save her life, rescuers had to amputate her left arm, which was pinned beneath a pillar. She begged them to save her arm but they told her they had no choice. They gave her an anesthetic but the agony was excruciating.\n\u201cI can\u2019t describe how painful it was,\u201d she recalled. \u201cMy life is ruined now.\u201d\nWith so many lives ruined or lost, public anger has largely focused on Mr. Rana, the building\u2019s owner. Garment industry leaders have blamed him for lying about the structural safety of the building; when cracks were discovered the day before the disaster, Mr. Rana is accused of assuring factory bosses that the building was safe to operate.\nAfter his arrest, Mr. Rana blamed the owners of the garment factories for insisting on operating the morning of the disaster.\n\u201cI did not force the owners,\u201d he said, according to bdnews24.com, an online news source in Bangladesh. \u201cIt was them who forced me, saying they would face huge losses, and shipments would be canceled if the factories were closed for even one day.\u201d\n\n14 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nThe Rana Plaza disaster, coming five months after 112 garment workers died in a fire at the Tazreen Fashions factory, has brought renewed criticism of the failure of Western brands to ensure safe working conditions in the factories they use in Bangladesh. In recent days, different Western brands have expressed sorrow over the accident but none, as yet, has endorsed proposals for tougher independent safety inspection programs.\nSoon, the rescue efforts at Rana Plaza will likely come to a close and the operation will shift toward clearing the rubble. Late on Sunday night, rescuers started using two cranes and other heavy machinery. Officials are suggesting that few, if any, are likely still alive.\nYet there are still thousands of people clinging to hope. A young wife who managed to escape the fourth floor was sitting on the ground, holding a photo of her husband, who had been working on the third floor. And another woman sat less than 50 yards from the building, crying, surrounded by invoices from garment orders that were scattered on the ground.\nWhen a soldier asked her to move somewhere safer and farther away from the wreckage, she wailed at him. She had two sons somewhere inside the building.\n\u201cIt would be better if you killed me,\u201d she said, \u201cthan if you asked me to go away.\u201d",

    "text": "Major Retailers Join Bangladesh Safety Plan\n2013-05-13T13:30:31.000Z\nThree weeks after a building collapse in Bangladesh that killed more than 1,100 workers, several of the world\u2019s largest apparel companies \u2013 including the retailing giant H&M and Inditex, owner of the Zara chain \u2014 agreed on Monday to sign a far-reaching and legally binding plan that requires retailers to help finance fire safety and building improvements in the factories they use in Bangladesh.\nConsumer and labor groups hailed the move by Sweden-based H&M \u2013 which is the largest purchaser of garments from Bangladesh \u2013 as an important step toward improving factory safety in Bangladesh, saying it would increase pressure on other Western retailers and apparel brands to do likewise.\nWithin hours of H&M's Monday statement, C&A of the Netherlands and two British retailers, Primark and Tesco, also joined in.\nThe factory safety agreement calls for independent, rigorous factory safety inspections with public reports and mandatory repairs and renovations underwritten by Western retailers. A legally enforceable contract, it also calls for retailers to stop doing business with any factory that refuses to make necessary safety improvements, and for workers and their unions to have a substantial voice in factory safety.\nPVH, the parent company of Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Izod, also said it would sign on, an expanded version of an earlier proposal that PVH was one of two companies to sign. The new plan lasts five years, the previous one two years.\nEver since the collapse of the Rana Plaza building on April 24 on the outskirts of Dhaka, Bangladesh\u2019s capital, H&M, Wal-Mart, Gap and other companies have faced intense pressure to sign the agreement. Until Monday, only PVH and Tchibo, a German retailer, had.\nIn announcing its move, H&M said that \u201cin order to make an impact and be sustainable,\u201d the agreement \u201cwould need a broad coalition of brands.\u201d A company statement said the agreement committed a company to the goal of a safe and sustainable garment industry in Bangladesh \u201cin which no worker needs to fear fires, building collapses or other accidents that could be prevented with reasonable health and safety measures.\u201d\n\u201cFire and building safety are extremely important issues for us and we put a lot of effort and resources within this area,\u201d said Helena Helmersson, head of sustainability at the retailer. \u201cWith this commitment we can now influence even more in this issue. We hope for a broad coalition of signatures in order for the agreement to work effectively on ground.\u201d\nH&M and Gap were the target of an online petition that obtained more than 900,000 signatures and was sponsored by Avaaz, a human rights group. The petition said, \u201cYour companies and other multinationals profit from cheap labor, and can do much more to reduce the dangers of the places where your products are made.\u201d\n\u201cH&M\u2019s decision to sign the accord is crucial,\u201d said Scott Nova, executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a Washington-based factory monitoring group backed by 175 American colleges and universities. \u201cThey are the single largest producer of apparel in Bangladesh, ahead even of Wal-Mart. This accord now has tremendous momentum.\u201d\nPVH also said on Monday that it would contribute $2.5 million to underwrite factory safety improvements as part of the new plan.\nGap has resisted signing on, objecting to its legally binding nature and saying it was already doing a lot on its own, having hired a fire inspector and promised $22 million in loans for factory improvements.\nBangladeshi labor groups that have sifted through the Rana Plaza rubble have not found any evidence that H&M or Gap had garments made at any of the five factories in the building.\nBut numerous investor, religious, consumer and labor groups are pressing other companies known to have obtained apparel from the factories there \u2013 Benetton, Cato Fashions, the Children\u2019s Place, el Corte Ingles, Loblaws and Primark \u2013 to sign on to the safety plan. Primark, which had acknowledged that one of its suppliers had occupied the second floor of the eight-story building, had already pledged to compensate victims who worked for its supplier and their families.\nBangladesh is the world\u2019s second-largest apparel exporter, after China, and also has the lowest minimum wage in the world \u2014 $37 a month. Its low wages and lack of regulation have helped it attract billions of dollars in orders from Western retailers and apparel brands.\nOn Sunday, the Bangladeshi textiles minister, Abdul Latif Siddiky, said the government planned to raise the minimum wage for the nation\u2019s more than three million garment workers.\nOver the last week, H&M was in intense negotiations on the plan with officials from IndustriALL Global Union, a federation of 50 million workers from 140 countries and from UNI Global Union, a federation of 20 million service sector workers.\nIn a meeting sponsored by the German government that H&M, Wal-Mart and other retailers held with IndustriALL and other labor and nongovernment organizations two weeks ago, IndustriALL set a deadline of this Wednesday for retailers to sign on to what has often been called the PVH-Tchibo plan.",

    "text": "152 Bangladeshi Border Guards Get Death Penalty Over Revolt \n2013-11-05T15:59:37.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 In an apparently unprecedented ruling, 152 former members of the Bangladesh Rifles, a paramilitary border security force, were sentenced to death on Tuesday in connection with a bloody 2009 mutiny in which several thousand troops took control of their headquarters, demanding better working conditions, and killed scores of people.\nSome of the border guards broke down in tears after hearing their sentence, pronounced by Judge Mohammad Akhtaruzzaman in a crowded Dhaka courtroom under heavy security, and others shouted at the judge, saying the verdict was unfair.\n\u201cAllah will deliver justice of this injustice,\u201d they said. \nJudge Akhtaruzzaman said the testimony of some witnesses who described the blood bath was hair-raising. \u201cThe slain people were not merely killed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe dead bodies did not get the respect they deserve according to the law.\u201d\nThe mutiny began suddenly, at an annual conference of the border force, as a number of guards took their commanders, officers of the Bangladeshi Army, hostage. As soldiers massed around the building, the border guards announced a list of demands, among them better pay, permission to participate in lucrative United Nations peacekeeping missions, and changes in the force\u2019s command and control structure.\nThe revolt sprang from the border guards\u2019 longstanding jealousy of regular army troops, who had better quarters and pay. After the mutiny, the force, which guards the 2,500-mile border with India and Myanmar, was renamed the Border Guard Bangladesh.\nThe revolt collapsed 33 hours later, after army tanks surrounded the border guards\u2019 headquarters in the heart of this crowded capital. As the uprising ended, many border guards reportedly shed their uniforms and fled the site, while security forces combed the area for fugitives.\nPolice officers entering the building found a mass grave containing the bodies of officers in combat fatigues who had been seized as hostages. Seventy-four people were killed in the uprising, including 57 top-ranking and midranking army officers. The rest were civilians.\nThe mutiny posed a stark test for the country\u2019s leadership, elected after two years of army-backed emergency rule.\nRights advocates said they could not recall a time when so many defendants were sentenced to the death penalty in one single court proceeding. They were particularly struck by both the severity and the scope of the punishment in a country that has an established legal system and is not in a state of war.\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that there\u2019s some civil war situation where this might have happened, but there\u2019s nobody who\u2019s thought of it,\u201d said Brad Adams, the executive director of Human Rights Watch\u2019s Asia division. \u201cWe can\u2019t think of anything like it.\u201d\nProsecutors originally brought charges against 850 people \u2014 827 men serving in the Bangladesh Rifles and 23 civilians \u2014 but 277 were acquitted on Tuesday in the mass trial, which began in August 2011. Of those convicted, 256 were given sentences of 20 years or less and 161, including Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu, a former opposition member of Parliament, were sentenced to life in prison. Four of the accused died during the course of the trial.\nDefense lawyers said they would appeal, but relatives of the commanders killed applauded the sentences.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be satisfied until the verdict is implemented,\u201d said Nehreen Ferdousi, the widow of one slain officer, Col. Mujibul Huq.\nBangladesh has been one of the least frequent users of the death penalty in countries that still have capital punishment, according to Amnesty International. If all the defendants sentenced to death on Tuesday are executed, Bangladesh would rocket to third place in Amnesty\u2019s annual ranking of death penalty countries, surpassing Iraq, but still below Iran and China.",

    "text": "After Disaster, Bangladesh Lags in Policing Its Maze of Factories\n2013-07-03T01:35:05.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Not even two months after the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory building claimed more than 1,100 lives, a team of engineers arrived to assess another factory in the center of the capital. It was named Al-Hamra Garments, and it was one of hundreds of factories undergoing post-disaster inspections as Bangladesh sought to prove that its critical apparel industry was safe.\nBut this inspection, conducted in mid-June, was startling. The two engineers discovered that the eight-story factory was partly propped up by temporary cast-iron pillars placed on the ground floor. Several original beams and columns were cracked or disintegrating. And the factory was open for business, with more than 1,000 workers producing clothing for a Bangladeshi apparel conglomerate whose customers include Walmart and Gap.\n\u201cConsidering the severity of the building condition it is recommended that the use of the building be discontinued immediately,\u201d the two inspectors, professors at the country\u2019s top engineering college, concluded in their preliminary assessment report.\nYet last Saturday, nearly two weeks after the inspection, Al-Hamra Garments was still open. \u201cThe factory is fine,\u201d said an administrator, Shafiul Azam Chowdhury, on Saturday afternoon. He said two other inspection teams had concluded that the temporary propping made the building safe enough to continue operations during structural repairs.\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d he added in a telephone interview.\nBangladesh\u2019s garment industry, now the world\u2019s second-leading clothing exporter, after China\u2019s, is still struggling to recover from the April 24 collapse of Rana Plaza, the deadliest disaster in the history of the industry. To address concerns about unsafe buildings, government officials and industry leaders called for inspections to ensure the structural integrity of the country\u2019s 5,000 garment factories.\nBut two months after the collapse, the inspections process is disorganized and haphazard, with unclear lines of authority. The Ministry of Textiles is overseeing some inspections. An industry trade group is organizing others. The local development authority in Dhaka is involved, and the country\u2019s top engineering school is playing a central role. Some global brands have also sent inspection teams.\nThe situation at Al-Hamra Garments underscores the confusion. On Saturday, after a reporter for The New York Times visited the ground floor of the factory and began making inquiries, factory officials and the building\u2019s owner initially defended the decision to remain open. But late that night, company officials reversed course. The next morning, they closed the factory.\n\u201cWe reviewed all the reports, and our managing director decided to close it,\u201d Mr. Chowdhury said in a later telephone interview. \u201cWe were in a dilemma about what was to be done.\u201d\nIt was unclear what clothing was being made inside Al-Hamra Garments, but the factory is owned by one of Bangladesh\u2019s leading apparel conglomerates, the Palmal Group. Palmal has at least 23 factories and has been praised by Gap and Walmart as a top supplier, according to the company\u2019s Web site.\nInspecting Bangladesh\u2019s garment factories is an acutely complicated task. No government agency is certain of precisely how many such factories operate in Bangladesh, or where they are. Some inspectors are discovering that building plans filed with government agencies do not always match the actual buildings. Many factories built during the 1980s and 1990s have no architectural drawings at all.\nCritics often blame this lack of regulation on Dhaka\u2019s development authority, known as Rajuk. Last week, the authority\u2019s director told members of Bangladesh\u2019s Parliament that roughly 8,000 buildings in Dhaka, the national capital, lacked required approvals or violated construction codes. In a later interview, the authority\u2019s chief engineer blamed part of the problem on manpower: Rajuk has only 40 inspectors to oversee a million structures in Dhaka.\n\u201cImpossible,\u201d said the chief engineer, Mohammed Emdadul Islam, noting that plans to expand to 240 inspectors are still not sufficient.\nAfter the Rana Plaza disaster, there was a rush to inspect factories. The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, a leading industry trade group, quickly hired a staff of 10 engineers and announced that 19 factories had been closed during inspections.\nBut the inspection process quickly took on an ad hoc quality. One factory executive complained of submitting to inspections from five different entities. Most factories have not yet been inspected at all. Some brands have sent their own inspection teams, including Tesco, the British retailer, which stopped placing orders at one local garment maker, Liberty Fashions, after the chain\u2019s inspectors found structural problems in the factory \u2014 a finding angrily disputed by the factory\u2019s Bangladeshi owner.\nMeanwhile, reports in the Bangladeshi media about cracks in various factories have fueled fear and anger among workers. Last week, hundreds of people demonstrated in the industrial suburb of Savar after local officials closed their building, Razzak Plaza, in response to a local television report about cracks in the structure\u2019s rooftop canteen\n\u201cThis is false news!\u201d shouted several shopkeepers, furious at losing business.\nThe crowd blocked the main road and grew increasingly agitated as a local official pleaded for patience. The scene was unfolding less than a mile from the site of Rana Plaza.\n\u201cDo we want another Rana Plaza disaster?\u201d the local official shouted.\nTo lead the inspections effort, the Bangladesh government, as well as industry leaders, are leaning on a small group of professors at the country\u2019s leading engineering program, the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. Yet the school has only 30 professors who are experts in structural and geophysical engineering, meaning the inspections process is moving slowly, especially since the professors must continue with their teaching loads.\nMohammed Mujibur Rahman, chairman of the civil engineering department, said the university\u2019s inspection teams had so far assessed about 100 buildings, including 66 containing one or more garment factories. Dhaka is estimated to have between 1,500 and 2,000 garment factories.\n\u201cIt is ultimately the government that should ensure the buildings are safe,\u201d Mr. Rahman said, noting that the university, \u201cas an institution, doesn\u2019t have that capacity.\u201d\nStill, Mr. Rahman said his staff considered the inspections its duty and was working around the clock. He declined to identify which factories his teams had inspected but said defects were widespread, ranging from superficial cracks to more serious damage to columns and beams.\nInspection teams recommended that two buildings be closed because of risk of collapse. The Times later confirmed that the Al-Hamra Garments building was one of them and obtained a copy of the inspection report from a third party.\nThe building, in the crowded center of Dhaka, went up about 20 years ago. It is divided into two sections: a five-story wing that contains two cinemas and an eight-story building that houses Al-Hamra and another factory, Amazan Garments, also owned by the Palmal Group.\nIn response to the Rana Plaza collapse, officials at Palmal say, the company hired a leading local engineering firm, Shaheedullah and New Associates Ltd., to inspect all its factories. When problems were discovered at the Al-Hamra site, the Shaheedullah firm determined that the columns supporting about a third of the factory needed reinforcement. The firm then installed the temporary iron props and commenced with repairs.\n\u201cNow the above garments factory is safe from immediate collapse under all vertical loads,\u201d the firm stated in a report provided to Al-Hamra officials.\nOn the same day, the Bangladesh garment trade group also sent an inspection team, which surveyed the temporary support beams and concluded that the building was \u201csafe for garment operations\u201d as the structural repairs continued.\nBut the two-person team from the engineering university made a visual inspection and drew a starkly different conclusion. It found a \u201clarge number\u201d of \u201cseverely disintegrated\u201d columns. Other columns or beams had serious cracks. It also found design problems, reporting that in some areas, \u201cframing with beams and columns were absent.\u201d\n\u201cThe structure of the building needs immediate measures to counter the possible total failure and total collapse of the building,\u201d the university inspection report stated.\nAsked about these findings, the building\u2019s owner, Shafi Bikrampuri, initially argued that the three inspection reports were consistent. \u201cThey said it was not dangerous,\u201d he said, indicating he was not aware of the details of the university report. \u201cNo danger, nothing.\u201d \nBy Saturday night, though, Mr. Bikrampuri and officials at Al-Hamra Garments had changed their minds. \u201cBecause of the conflicting reports and opinions from the multiple organizations involved,\u201d Mr. Chowdhury said in a statement, \u201cwe were at a dilemma to reach an educated decision.\u201d\nOn Sunday morning, the factory was closed, with a notice telling workers that wages would still be paid. The company has hired yet another inspection team to conduct a comprehensive assessment.",

    "text": "A Capricious River, an Indian Island\u2019s Lifeline, Now Eats Away at It\n2013-04-15T00:25:24.000Z\nMAJULI, India \u2014 Not too long ago, Ganesh Hazarika grew rice, vegetables and peas near the edge of the Brahmaputra River on a small plot that provided him a livelihood and a safety net. Then one day the river took it away. Steadily and mercilessly, it had chewed at the banks until his tiny farm fell into the water.\nLandlessness is a rising problem for farmers across India, but Mr. Hazarika\u2019s situation is unusual: his plot was located on Majuli, one of the world\u2019s largest \u201cinland\u201d islands, an ancient religious center that is home to about 170,000 people and dozens of monasteries. The same river that has encircled the island and sustained it for centuries is now methodically tearing it apart.\n\u201cThere is nothing permanent here,\u201d Mr. Hazarika said on a recent morning, as he stood near a small temple that villagers are planning to move this month as a precaution against erosion. \u201cIt changes every year.\u201d\nFor many environmentalists and scientists, the Brahmaputra is a critical laboratory in studying the impact of climate change, with much of the attention focused on the mouth of the river in Bangladesh, where rising waters are expected to radically reorient one of the world\u2019s most important estuaries and potentially displace millions of people in the coming decades.\nBut many miles upstream, the Brahmaputra is also proving difficult to predict or constrain. Seasonal flooding, always a problem, has intensified in recent years in the northeastern Indian state of Assam. Erosion is a concern across Assam, as the huge river regularly shifts course while carrying sand and other sediment from the Himalayas in a simultaneous process of construction and destruction: new sandbars appear even as old, inhabited places are battered by the currents of the river.\nClimate change is contributing to these upstream changes, some scientists say, though the Brahmaputra is naturally unstable because of seismic activity and the river\u2019s braided shape. The erosion of Majuli has become the most drastic example of the river\u2019s ruthless power, and local officials, trying to protect the monasteries and the island\u2019s growing population, have responded by building embankments and other protective measures.\n\u201cThe situation is worsening over time,\u201d said D. C. Goswami, a Brahmaputra expert and former head of the department of environmental sciences at Gauhati University. \u201cThe measures we are adopting are not able to cope with the problem. We need a more holistic and integrated approach.\u201d\nAlong the southern rim of Majuli, in an area known as Salmara, the Brahmaputra extends to the horizon, seemingly as endless as a churning sea. At its widest, the river can stretch more than 10 miles across. Here, the edge of the island is sheared into a cliff that falls 30 feet to the water, with banana trees floating below, having fallen over the side. Many villagers say they are planning to move deeper into the island this month because of erosion.\n\u201cMy house fell into the water,\u201d said Puna Bhuyan, a hunched farmer in his 70s who was picking mustard seeds recently. He said he had moved three times since 2000. \u201cWe are worried about our livelihoods. How can we provide for our families? That uncertainty is always there.\u201d\nAs a braided river \u2014 one that divides into a labyrinth of tributaries and channels \u2014 the Brahmaputra was essentially tossed off its tracks after a major earthquake in 1950. The quake raised the river\u2019s floor, increased its load of sediment from the Himalayas and shifted some of the deeper channels so that currents began pounding Majuli.\nArupjyoti Saikia, a historian and expert on the Brahmaputra who teaches at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, said that Majuli became an island in the 1760s, after a previous earthquake led to new river channels that severed the area from the mainland and, in doing so, isolated a major hub of Assamese culture and religion. Since the 15th century, Majuli has been a center of Vaishnavism, a monotheistic branch of Hinduism centered on the god Vishnu and his avatar Krishna.\nToday, there are 36 monasteries, known as satras, yet erosion has forced several of them to relocate within the island. Another 28 monasteries have been moved off the island altogether.\n\u201cWe believe that if we worship the Brahmaputra and make all the prayer offerings, then the river will not disturb us,\u201d said one Vaishnavite priest, Ajit Sharma, as he sat cross-legged in a satra.\nIn recent years, government officials nominated Majuli as a candidate for World Heritage status under Unesco, though the initial application was returned because of various problems. Laya Madduri, the island\u2019s highest ranking civil servant, said local leaders were now trying to organize preservation plans for the remaining satras and also draft a comprehensive conservation plan for the entire island.\nEstimating exactly how much erosion has occurred is a matter of debate. Data collected in 1901 suggested that the island was more than 463 square miles; but this figure may have included other surrounding islands and riverbeds. A 2004 academic study concluded that Majuli had eroded to 163 square miles in 2001 from 290 square miles in 1917. And where the island once had 49 named streams in 1917, the number had dropped to 7 by 1972.\n\u201cThere are other braided rivers in the world,\u201d Professor Saikia said. \u201cBut because of the earthquake, the river continues to suffer, and to fluctuate. The river is still very, very unstable.\u201d\nFor decades, Assam\u2019s state government was charged with protecting the island and responded, primarily, by building embankments. India\u2019s national government created a special Brahmaputra Board, which plugged breaches in existing embankments and other structures that are intended to enhance siltation or redirect the river\u2019s currents. D. J. Bargohain, the board\u2019s chief engineer, says these efforts have actually increased the size of the island by nearly eight square miles since 2004.\n\u201cIt is not possible to stop erosion completely,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have lost area in certain parts and gained in other parts.\u201d\nSome experts are skeptical about that claim, especially since much of the new land is often uninhabitable. Some sandbars have enough vegetation for cattle grazing or for growing mustard seeds, but usually the land that is lost is more productive than the land that is gained. Mr. Goswami, the environmental expert, said it was impossible to gauge the impact of climate change on the island, but he noted that environmental patterns did seem to be shifting in the region.\n\u201cWe have high floods during the flood times,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have dry conditions that are more intense now. The periods of drought and periods of flooding are changing, too.\u201d\nAlong the island\u2019s southern rim, people are preparing to move again and build thatch huts atop platforms provided by the local government. Binumai Kalita, 40, lives in a hut that is now less than 75 feet from the island\u2019s sheared cliff. Her pumpkin patch extends to the cliff, and five days earlier she watched as a stand of banana trees fell into the river.\n\u201cWe are afraid,\u201d Ms. Kalita said. \u201cWe see it in front of our eyes. Ten years ago, this land stretched out another two kilometers,\u201d or more than a mile.\nNow there is only water.",

    "text": "Bangladesh Sentences Islamist, 91, to 90 Years for Crimes in \u201971 War\n2013-07-15T12:46:01.000Z\nNEW DELHI \u2014 A Bangladeshi war crimes tribunal sentenced an aged but still powerful Islamist to 90 years in jail for crimes committed during the country\u2019s 1971 war for independence from Pakistan, drawing fury from those who found the punishment either too harsh or too weak.\nThe Islamist, Ghulam Azam, who is 91 and in ill health, was convicted on all five major counts against him, including murder, conspiracy, and incitement and complicity to genocide. The tribunal concluded that a death sentence would have been appropriate for the charges but instead handed down what is effectively life in prison. \nMr. Azam was part of a dedicated group of Islamists who were opposed to the Bangladeshi independence movement and actively collaborated with Pakistani military officials, the court found. Until 2000, he was the leader of Jamaat-e-Islami, a small but well-organized Islamist party.\nHe is the third Islamist leader to be convicted in recent months for collaborating with the Pakistani authorities during the 1971 war, in which as many as three million people were killed and more than 200,000 women raped, and when an estimated 10 million people fled to India. Several more such verdicts are expected in the coming months.\nThe trials and the verdicts, part of a long-delayed reckoning with Bangladesh\u2019s birth, have led to violent strikes and deep unrest in Bangladesh pitting members of Jamaat-e-Islami against youthful progressives who have demanded death sentences for the Islamist leaders.\nEach side in the fight has repeatedly called for strikes that have paralyzed the country and wounded its economy, which was already reeling from disasters in its all-important textile industry, including the collapse of the Rana Plaza building, which killed more than 1,100 people. Jamaat-e-Islami called for a strike on Monday in advance of the expected verdict, and at least one person was beaten to death by political activists for failing to heed the strike call, according to local media reports.\nDr. Atiq Rahman, executive director of the Bangladesh Center for Advanced Studies, said that while both sides in the dispute were dissatisfied with the verdict announced Monday, he did not expect the same level of violence that followed previous verdicts.\n\u201cNeither side got what they wanted,\u201d Dr. Rahman said.\nMr. Azam\u2019s lawyers have vowed to appeal.\nWhen Pakistan lost the war, Mr. Azam moved abroad and formed a government-in-exile in London called the East Pakistan Restoration Committee. Bangladesh canceled his citizenship in 1973, and for years he traveled on a Pakistani passport. He returned to Bangladesh in 1978.\nMr. Azam was charged with directing atrocities that resulted in deaths and torture, and the court cited news reports from the time to demonstrate that Mr. Azam had been intimately involved in suppressing the Bengali independence movement. Mr. Azam\u2019s lawyers responded that, as a politician, he had not been directly involved in killings or torture and that the procedures and documents used by the war crimes court were improper.\nSince his arrest in January 2012, Mr. Azam has been largely confined to a prison cell at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital, but allowed home-cooked food.

    "text": "Bangladesh Pollution, Told in Colors and Smells\n2013-07-15T01:34:36.000Z\nSAVAR, Bangladesh \u2014 On the worst days, the toxic stench wafting through the Genda Government Primary School is almost suffocating. Teachers struggle to concentrate, as if they were choking on air. Students often become lightheaded and dizzy. A few boys fainted in late April. Another retched in class.\nThe odor rises off the polluted canal \u2014 behind the schoolhouse \u2014 where nearby factories dump their wastewater. Most of the factories are garment operations, textile mills and dyeing plants in the supply chain that exports clothing to Europe and the United States. Students can see what colors are in fashion by looking at the canal.\n\u201cSometimes it is red,\u201d said Tamanna Afrous, the school\u2019s English teacher. \u201cOr gray. Sometimes it is blue. It depends on the colors they are using in the factories.\u201d\nNearly three months ago, the Rana Plaza factory building collapsed, killing more than 1,100 people, in a disaster that exposed the risks in the low-cost formula that has made Bangladesh the world\u2019s second-leading clothing exporter, after China, and a favorite of companies like Walmart, J. C. Penney and H & M. That formula depends on paying the lowest wages in the world and, at some factories, spending a minimum on work conditions and safety.\nBut it also often means ignoring costly environmental regulations. Bangladesh\u2019s garment and textile industries have contributed heavily to what experts describe as a water pollution disaster, especially in the large industrial areas of Dhaka, the capital. Many rice paddies are now inundated with toxic wastewater. Fish stocks are dying. And many smaller waterways are being filled with sand and garbage, as developers sell off plots for factories or housing.\nEnvironmental damage usually trails rapid industrialization in developing countries. But Bangladesh is already one of the world\u2019s most environmentally fragile places, densely populated yet braided by river systems, with a labyrinth of low-lying wetlands leading to the Bay of Bengal. Even as pollution threatens agriculture and public health, Bangladesh is acutely vulnerable to climate change, as rising sea levels and changing weather patterns could displace millions of people and sharply reduce crop yields.\nHere in Savar, an industrial suburb of Dhaka and the site of the collapsed Rana Plaza building, some factories treat their wastewater, but many do not have treatment plants or chose not to operate them to save on utility costs. Many of Savar\u2019s canals or wetlands are now effectively retention ponds of untreated industrial waste.\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s not only in Savar,\u201d said Mohammed Abdul Kader, who has been Savar\u2019s mayor since his predecessor was suspended in the wake of the Rana Plaza disaster. \u201cThe whole country is suffering from pollution. In Savar, we have lots of coconut trees, but they don\u2019t produce coconuts anymore. Industrial pollution is damaging our fish stocks, our fruit produce, our vegetables.\u201d\nBangladesh has laws to protect the environment, a national environment ministry and new special courts for environmental cases. Yet pollution is rising, not falling, experts say, largely because of the political and economic power of industry.\nTanneries and pharmaceutical plants are part of the problem, but textile and garment factories, a mainstay of the economy and a crucial source of employment, have the most clout. When the environment ministry appointed a tough-minded official who levied fines against textile and dyeing factories, complaining owners eventually forced his transfer.\n\u201cNobody in the country, at least at the government level, is thinking about sustainable development,\u201d said Rizwana Hasan, a prominent environmental lawyer. \u201cAll of the natural resources have been severely degraded and depleted.\u201d\nLess than two miles from the site of Rana Plaza, the Genda primary school has a student body made up mostly of the children of garment workers. Golam Rabbi, 11, who is the top-ranked student in the third grade there, lives with his mother and two younger brothers in a single room. The boys use price tags collected from factory floors as makeshift playing cards.\n\u201cThe school always smells,\u201d Golam said. \u201cSometimes we can\u2019t even eat there. It is making some kids sick. Sometimes my head spins. It is hard to concentrate.\u201d\nHis family is still struggling to recover from the Rana Plaza collapse. His father, a security guard, was killed in the disaster, and his mother is trying to support her sons and keep the two oldest in school. The father had left school for work \u2014 as had the mother \u2014 and both parents believed education could provide their sons a better life.\n\u201cHis main goal was to get his children educated,\u201d Golam\u2019s mother, Hasina Begum, said of her husband.\nBut the pollution has made it hard. Golam has fainted from the smell. \u201cHe has told me several times that he doesn\u2019t want to study at the school,\u201d his mother said. \u201cWhen it is very hot, and the breeze brings in the bad smell, he can\u2019t breathe properly. I tried to reassure him, saying that people are holding rallies. I don\u2019t know why the pollution is still continuing, why they can\u2019t stop it.\u201d\nFactories surround the school: within 300 yards are two garment factories, two dyeing operations, a textile mill, a brick factory and a pharmaceutical plant. At least 10 dyeing plants can be found in a slightly larger radius. An underground drainage channel dumps wastewater through a pipe into the canal behind the school.\nMohammed Abdul Ali, the school\u2019s headmaster, said he had approached local factory owners, as well as Savar officials, trying to get the drainage pipe moved. Mothers of children at the school, including Golam\u2019s mother, have held awareness workshops and rallies. Local environmentalists have also campaigned.\n\n9 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen the owners take our appeals seriously,\u201d Mr. Ali said. \u201cEverything is going on as usual. They have a good relationship with the politicians. That is why they don\u2019t care.\u201d\nOn a recent rainy afternoon, the smell was overpowering as the school\u2019s fifth graders gathered in a classroom. Asked how many had parents working in garment factories, 23 of the 34 students in the room raised their hands. \n\u201cSometimes my head is spinning,\u201d one student said of the smell. \u201cSometimes we feel like we need to vomit,\u201d another said.\nBarely 100 yards away, behind a battered metal gate, the Surma Garments factory was dyeing fabric in a shade of dark purple. Mahadi Hasan, a manager, offered a tour of the Effluent Treatment Plant, where wastewater is treated with chemicals in a series of concrete tubs. He called for a worker to bring beakers with \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d samples \u2014 only to be handed an \u201cafter\u201d sample in which the water was light purple.\nAsked about pollution at the nearby school, Mr. Hasan said his wastewater flowed in the opposite direction, though that would mean it flowed uphill. \u201cThere are some other factories around here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe water might be from them.\u201d\nIn February, environmental regulators fined Surma Garments and four other factories for illegally dumping pollution. Two years earlier, another factory near the school, Anlima Yarn Dyeing, was fined for dumping untreated waste, even though it had a functioning effluent treatment plant. Local news accounts said that Anlima Yarn had been operating without an environmental clearance certificate for 23 years.\nThe inspections were part of a highly publicized antipollution enforcement campaign led by Munir Chowdhury, a senior official in the environment ministry. Mr. Chowdhury raided factories, often at night, finding that many were saving money by dumping waste without treating it. He imposed repeated fines until he was transferred this year to run the state dairy operation.\nMr. Kader, the acting mayor of Savar, said there was only so much a single official could do. \u201cYou should understand the reality in Bangladesh,\u201d he said. \u201cThese people who are setting up industries and factories here are much more powerful than me. When a government minister calls me and tells me to give permission to someone to set up a factory in Savar, I can\u2019t refuse.\u201d\nFor global brands that buy clothing from Bangladeshi factories, pollution rarely gets the same attention as workplace conditions or fire safety. H &M has sponsored some environmental programs, but Bangladeshi environmentalists say global buyers have done far too little.\n\u201cThe buyers totally understand the conditions of Bangladesh and they take advantage of it,\u201d said Ms. Hasan, the environmental lawyer.",

    "text": "$40 Million in Aid Set for Bangladesh Garment Workers\n2013-12-24T01:57:54.000Z\nEight months after the Rana Plaza factory building collapsed in Bangladesh, killing more than 1,100 workers and leaving hundreds of families bereft and financially adrift, several prominent retailers and labor groups have joined with the Bangladesh government to create an estimated $40 million compensation fund to aid the victims\u2019 families.\nSo far, four retailers \u2014 Bonmarch\u00e9, El Corte Ingl\u00e9s, Loblaw and Primark \u2014 have pledged to contribute to the fund, which is intended to compensate the families of those who died last April 24 in what was the deadliest disaster in garment industry history. The new fund is considered a landmark in compensating families of garment industry victims, in terms of both the amount to be paid and the sophistication of the arrangements. No United States-based retailers have signed on.\nSeveral officials involved in negotiations to establish the fund said in interviews that the families of the dead would receive, on average, more than $25,000 each, while hundreds of workers who were injured or maimed would also receive compensation. Per capita income in Bangladesh is about $1,900 a year.\nThe fund\u2019s members said they hoped to begin making payments in February, although they have yet to decide how much each firm will contribute, which depends in part on whether governments donate. The money is to be paid in installments to ensure that the families have a steady source of income for years to come. \u201cWe think the agreement is a really good result,\u201d said Ineke Zeldenrust, international coordinator of the Clean Clothes Campaign, a European antisweatshop group that has pressed retailers to do far more to help the families of the disaster\u2019s victims. \u201cThe agreement will deliver to all the victims and the families of the Rana Plaza disaster full and fair compensation in a credible manner. What we need now is for other companies to agree to pay into the fund.\u201d\nFamilies of the victims have already received several months of short-term emergency aid from the Bangladesh government as well as from Primark, an Anglo-Irish retailer. But these families have been pressing for long-term compensation.\nIn some families, with the mother dead, children have quit school and gone to work. In other cases, workers who were seriously injured and cannot work are desperate for income.\nTalks to establish the fund, coordinated by the International Labor Organization, began in September but stalled over such issues as how to collect information on claims, how to determine which claims were legitimate and who should administer the fund. The amount to be paid will be based on the anticipated wage loss of each worker killed, tied to the number of children, or, if the beneficiary is a parent, to the life expectancy of an adult.\nWith 1,800 workers having died in garment industry disasters in Bangladesh over the last decade, Dan Rees, program director for the Better Work organization, an affiliate of the International Labor Organization, said: \u201cIf you look at the history of compensation efforts in the Bangladesh garment industry, it\u2019s not a good one. But this is a potential breakthrough.\u201d\nAmong the groups that signed the agreement to create the compensation were the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, IndustriAll Global Union, the Bangladesh Employers Federation and the main Bangladesh coalition of labor unions.\nSome retailers and labor rights groups have expressed dismay that no United States retailers have agreed to join the compensation effort.\n\u201cFollowing the collapse, we came very quickly to the conclusion that compensation was not only a necessity for the survivors and their families, but a responsibility for the many retailers sourcing from Rana Plaza,\u201d said Robert Chant, senior vice president for corporate affairs at Loblaw, a Canadian company. \u201cWe are still hopeful that other retailers will join us in meeting the obligation, but we\u2019ve already made public our disappointment in the failure of others to step forward.\u201d\nLoblaw owns the Joe Fresh apparel chain, with apparel from one of Rana Plaza\u2019s factories.\nAmid warnings that its columns were crumbling, the poorly constructed building collapsed, crushing hundreds of workers in tons of concrete and steel.\nLabor rights groups say they found documents and remnants of apparel tying 25 European and American retailers and brands to the five garment factories spread across Rana Plaza\u2019s eight floors. Several of the firms have since denied their apparel came from any of the factories. Mango, a Spanish apparel brand, said, for instance, that it only had a test order in a factory there.\n\n10 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nWalmart has been urged to help the Rana Plaza families because production documents found in the rubble indicated that a Canadian contractor was producing jeans for Walmart in 2012 at the Ether Tex factory inside the building. Walmart said an unauthorized contractor was producing garments there without its knowledge. It says it is focused on assuring that there are no such disasters in the future.\nThe Children\u2019s Place, which had obtained apparel from one of the factories inside Rana Plaza, said the factory was not supplying it at the time of the collapse.\nA Walmart official said the company had no comment about requests for it to contribute to the fund. The Children\u2019s Place did not respond to inquiries.\n\u201cThese brands produced at Rana Plaza, yet did nothing to protect the workers who made their clothes, despite a history of deadly building collapses in Bangladesh,\u201d said Scott Nova, executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a monitoring group based in Washington that is financed by American colleges and universities. \u201cIncredibly, some companies do not seem to feel the slightest responsibility to the families whose lives were destroyed as a result of this negligence.\u201d\nOfficials involved in the compensation fund say they have not yet worked out how much money each participant should contribute. That will depend, in part, on how many retailers ultimately agree to participate and whether various governments agree to give money.\nSome industry experts say the American companies are afraid to participate for fear of being exposed to legal liability or appearing hypocritical after denying that they knowingly did business at Rana Plaza at the time of the collapse.\nMr. Rees, the I.L.O. official, said contributions would not lead to liability. \u201cAt the moment, this effort needs support,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needs the backing of companies that were in Rana Plaza when it collapsed, that were there in the recent past before it collapsed and that weren\u2019t in there at all and want to show solidarity with the industry.\u201d",

    "text": "800,000 Evacuated as Powerful Cyclone Hits India\n2013-10-12T08:06:08.000Z\nNEW DELHI \u2014 A powerful cyclone whose spinning arms engulfed much of the Bay of Bengal weakened Sunday morning as it crashed into India\u2019s eastern coast, flooding homes and roads throughout the region and disrupting electricity and communications.\nThe authorities evacuated about 800,000 people, one of the largest such evacuations in India\u2019s history. The storm\u2019s maximum sustained winds, which were approximately 124 miles per hour when the storm made landfall about 9 p.m. Saturday, had dropped to less than half that strength nine hours later.\nAt least five people were killed in the coastal city of Gopalpur because of heavy rain and high winds before the storm made landfall, officials said. The storm was expected to drop up to 10 inches of rain over the next two days in some areas.\nThe Indian predictions before the storm hit were less alarming than those from the meteorological authorities in the United States. Late Friday, the United States Navy\u2019s Joint Typhoon Warning Center said the storm, then barreling across the Bay of Bengal, had maximum sustained winds of 161 m.p.h., with gusts reaching 196 m.p.h. \u2014 making it similar to a Category 5 hurricane, the most severe.\nBut once the storm arrived on land, its intensity was more modest, and Indian officials defended their more measured forecast as having been more accurate.\n\u201cWe are not trying to downplay the intensity of the cyclone,\u201d M. Shashidhar Reddy, the vice chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority, said at a news conference Saturday. \u201cIn fact, U.S. authorities are overplaying it.\u201d\nOn Saturday, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, in Hawaii, reduced its estimates, saying they showed maximum sustained winds of about 138 m.p.h. and gusts of up to 167 m.p.h.\nL. S. Rathore, director general of the India Meteorological Department, termed the storm, named Cyclone Phailin, a \u201cvery serious cyclonic storm.\u201d By Sunday, Mr. Reddy said, the storm is likely to be downgraded to a \u201cserious cyclonic storm.\u201d\nStill, the true scope of natural disasters in India is often not known for days, given its large population and fairly weak central government. And powerful cyclones in the Bay of Bengal have a history of being particularly deadly because the geography funnels the storms into some of the most densely populated and poorest regions in the world. About 12 million people were in the storm\u2019s path, according to Indian officials.\nMore than 10,000 people were killed 14 years ago when a powerful cyclone came ashore in roughly the same area, and more than 300,000 were killed in 1970 when a storm hit what is now Bangladesh. But disaster preparation arrangements are far better now, officials said.\nPrime Minister Manmohan Singh said in a statement Saturday that he had been briefed on preparations for the storm and had directed that the central government extend all needed assistance to state officials.\nIn the Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh State, many mud homes and farms were destroyed, and uprooted trees blocked roads, according to officials there. About 30,000 people were evacuated from coastal villages in Andhra Pradesh.\nK. Baliah, a district official involved in rescue efforts, said coastal residents had been reluctant to leave until they saw the sea rise. \u201cAt first they refused to leave their properties,\u201d he said. Then, \u201cwhen the water started to enter their communities around 2 p.m., the people decided themselves that they must leave.\u201d\nThe surge accompanying the storm was expected to reach nearly 10 feet, weather officials said, which would cause heavy flooding across Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, another coastal state.\nService members from the country\u2019s army, air force and navy were deployed to help in rescue and relief operations, said A. K. Antony, India\u2019s defense minister.\nThe air force deployed C-130 aircraft, recently purchased from the United States, to help in the efforts, and the navy had diving teams with inflatable rafts deployed at important locations, Mr. Antony said. Military helicopters were also available for rescues, he said.\nPentayya Chintakayala, 33, a fisherman from a village near the port city of Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, said the fishermen of his village had stopped fishing and moved their boats inland, but were concerned that they could lose everything if the storm was as severe as predicted.\n\u201cWhat they tell us on television and what we see in the waves have nothing to do with each other,\u201d he said. \u201cFishermen don\u2019t always listen to the warnings, and 90 percent of the time that\u2019s O.K., but 10 percent of the time the warnings are true, and we lose everything because we don\u2019t believe them. Fishermen are stubborn like that.\u201d\nMr. Chintakayala added that it was difficult to store fishing equipment very far inland, \u201cbecause the boats are heavy and there isn\u2019t much place to store them.\u201d\nOfficials in the Visakhapatnam district were able to evacuate 21,500 people to relief camps by Saturday evening, including 3,500 inhabitants of flood-prone slums in the city of Visakhapatnam. But they said that they had often resorted to force, and that 30,000 more might have to be evacuated if the worst predictions came to pass.\n\u201cBasically the people are not willing to come to the shelters, because they are worried that they will lose their belongings,\u201d said M. Venkateswarao, the district revenue officer. \u201cThey say that nothing bad will happen and that we are unnecessarily forcing them. But even if one person dies, it will look very bad for the district administration.\u201d",

    "text": "Two Indias\n2013-09-06T15:07:00.000Z\nIn late June, a television reporter named Narayan Pargaien spent three days in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand to cover the region\u2019s devastating monsoon floods, which have killed more than 5,700 people. Like most journalists covering the disaster, Pargaien dutifully described families who had lost everything, including their modest thatch-roofed homes. Unlike most journalists, Pargaien reported from the scene while perched on the shoulders of a flood victim in the middle of a swollen river. As the outrage poured in, Pargaien tried to explain himself. In an interview with the Indian Web site Newslaundry, he said the man who carried him had insisted upon it. \u201cHe was grateful to us and wanted to show me some respect,\u201d Pargaien said, \u201cas it was the first time someone of my level had visited his house.\u201d\nThe India captured in that image \u2014 a preening consumer economy built on the backs of the destitute \u2014 is the subject of \u201cAn Uncertain Glory,\u201d a new book by the economists Jean Dr\u00e8ze and Amartya Sen that aims to bring the poor to the center of public discussion about the country\u2019s future. It\u2019s an urgent, passionate, political work that makes the case that India cannot move forward without investing significantly \u2014 as every other major industrialized country has already done \u2014 in public services: \u201cThe lack of health care, tolerably good schools and other basic facilities important for human well-being and elementary freedoms, keeps a majority of Indians shackled to their deprived lives in a way quite rarely seen in other self-respecting countries that are trying to move ahead in the world.\u201d\nSen, who won the Nobel in economic science in 1998, and Dr\u00e8ze, his longtime collaborator, begin by retelling the story of India\u2019s recent economic boom. They show that, leaving aside per capita income, which has grown impressively, India is actually falling behind its neighbors in South Asia \u2014 never mind America, Europe and China \u2014 in every social indicator that matters, from literacy to child malnutrition to access to toilets. The chapter on the country\u2019s woeful schools is a welcome corrective to the idea of India as a nation of brilliant, job-stealing engineers. In fact, large numbers of Indian \u00adprimary-school students are unable to write a simple sentence or do basic arithmetic. In an alarming chapter on health, Dr\u00e8ze and Sen point out that while the Taliban\u2019s opposition to polio vaccines in Pakistan has rightly \u00adcreated an international furor, there is scant attention paid to India\u2019s dismal rates of child immunization, which are among the lowest in the world, \u201ceven without a \u00adTaliban.\u201d\nThese comparisons are rhetorical tools; the authors use them to show that India\u2019s problems can\u2019t be attributed to culture or democracy or a lack of tax revenue. Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka are all messy, multiparty democracies with deeply conservative religious traditions and legacies of colonial oppression. And yet, with fewer resources, they have made solid progress in improving health and education while India stagnates.\nSo what\u2019s the problem? According to Dr\u00e8ze and Sen, even though the poor constitute a vast majority of Indian voters, they have been shut out of public discourse. \u201cWhat a democratic system achieves depends largely on what issues are brought into political engagement,\u201d they write. That\u2019s why \u201cAn Uncertain Glory\u201d directs so much of its criticism toward the \u201ccelebratory media,\u201d the proliferation of satellite channels and newspapers dominated by breathless gossip about cricketers, billionaires and Bollywood stars and point-scoring among the political elite. The Indian media are not unique in their love of froth and scandal, but the stakes are higher when these news outlets set the agenda for a country with \u201cthe largest population of seriously undernourished people in the world.\u201d\nAs if to prove their point, coverage of the book in India, where it was published in July, has been dominated by the \u201cfeud\u201d between Dr\u00e8ze and Sen, champions of the poor, and the economists Jagdish Bhagwati and Arvind Panagariya, co-authors of \u201cWhy Growth Matters\u201d and champions of market deregulation, who argue that too much spending on social welfare programs might derail economic growth. But it would be a mistake to read \u201cAn Uncertain Glory\u201d as a screed against liberalization. This book is something bigger, a heartfelt plea to rethink what progress in a poor country ought to look like. What difference does it make, the authors ask, to lift millions above some notional poverty line if they still lack the basics of a decent life? That is the paradox at the heart of Katherine Boo\u2019s best seller \u201cBehind the Beautiful Forevers: Life, Death and Hope in a Mumbai Slum\u201d \u2014 it isn\u2019t simply want of money that makes the slum dwellers of Annawadi miserable; it\u2019s being trapped in a system that\u2019s rigged against them.\nWhile Dr\u00e8ze and Sen have called for investing in social welfare before, this book comes at a crucial time. Ineffectiveness and corruption plague India\u2019s public sector, but recent data show that when it comes to health and education, outcomes in the private sector are no better. \u201cThere is a real need for pragmatism here,\u201d they write, \u201cand to avoid both the crushing inefficiency of market denial . . . and the pathology of ideological marketization.\u201d\nIn the interest of pragmatism, Dr\u00e8ze and Sen might have devoted more thought to how to make India\u2019s existing social-\u00adwelfare initiatives work better. They describe successes in a few forward-thinking states, but it is not clear how to replicate those results on a national scale. The section on discrimination against girls \u2014 an issue on which Sen is an unquestioned expert \u2014 also cries out for a more prescriptive analysis. When even girls\u2019 education seems to have no effect on gender inequality, what\u2019s left?\nStill, the value of \u201cAn Uncertain Glory\u201d is its wide-angle view. In a sense, Dr\u00e8ze and Sen are playing a role similar to that of Narayan Pargaien\u2019s cameraman. The shot intended for broadcast was supposed to show only the reporter with flood as background \u2014 viewers were never meant to see the man beneath him. But the anonymous cameraman pulled back to reveal the big, unflattering picture. Such small acts of conscience can enrich public reasoning enormously; India, as this important book argues, needs many more of them. ",

    "text": "Bangladesh Factory, Site of Fire That Trapped and Killed 7, Made European Brands\n2013-01-28T00:33:04.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Clothing from many European brands, including at least two brands owned by the Spanish apparel giant Inditex, was discovered Sunday inside a charred factory where a deadly weekend fire killed seven female workers, including several who were teenagers. \nThe blaze at the Smart Export Garments factory, which erupted Saturday afternoon in a densely populated area of Dhaka, the capital, is the latest tragedy for a Bangladeshi garment industry that is now the world\u2019s second-biggest clothing exporter, trailing only China. Two months ago, a fire at the Tazreen Fashions factory killed 112 workers, where jeans, lingerie and sweaters were made for retailers like Walmart and Sears.\nInternational labor advocates, who have been pressing global brands and retailers to help pay to upgrade fire-safety measures in Bangladeshi factories, said the latest fire was a grim reminder of how conditions must be improved to ensure the safety of workers who are paid as little as $37 a month to make clothing for Western retailers and consumers. Just since November, advocates say, Bangladesh has also experienced 18 other nonfatal factory fires.\n\u201cAfter more than two decades of the apparel industry knowing about the risks to these workers, nothing substantial has changed,\u201d said Judy Gearhart, executive director of the International Labor Rights Forum, in a statement. \nOn Sunday, labels from several French brands, including Sol\u2019s, Scott and Fox and G Blog by Gemo could be seen in the burned second-floor Smart Export Garments factory. Two other labels manufactured for Inditex, the world\u2019s largest fashion group, were also visible \u2014 Leftie\u2019s and Bershka. Labor activists found labels for the German low-cost brand KIK and a purchase order by a New York firm, M. Hidary & Company, for Hawaiian Authentics swimwear. \nInditex, a conglomerate that operates more than 5,000 stores worldwide, is perhaps best known for the popular Spanish brand Zara. Company executives in Spain could not be reached for comment on Sunday. But a Bangladeshi newspaper, The Daily Star, quoted an unnamed local representative for the company as saying that Inditex was unaware that the Smart Export factory was making its goods.\n\u201cWe are now sifting through the purchase order documents to know who were given the work orders and how Smart Export Garment Ltd. got the orders under subcontract,\u201d the unnamed company official told The Daily Star. \u201cThe actual receivers of purchase orders have given the work orders to Smart Export Garment in a sneaky way without informing the buyer.\u201d\nGlobal brands have promised Western consumers that clothes are manufactured in safe factories that are inspected through regular audits, often conducted by third-party auditing firms. But the fire at the Smart Export Garments factory has again exposed loopholes in that system: the factory was filling many orders on subcontracts with other suppliers for global brands. It was unclear whether the factory had ever been audited.\nThe Bangladeshi authorities have confirmed that the building was illegally constructed and lacked proper fire-safety measures, including extinguishers and emergency exits. More than 300 workers were inside the factory when the fire erupted Saturday. Most of the workers were young seamstresses who panicked after discovering that one exit was blocked by a locked metal gate. Some jumped from windows to escape.\n\u201cWe are sure that this factory doesn\u2019t have a fire license, and they never applied for one,\u201d said Mamun Mahmud, a fire official who is part of a special committee investigating the blaze. He noted that a fire safety license was mandatory for all garment factories in Bangladesh.\nMoreover, the factory was apparently hiring teenagers. In Bangladesh, labor laws allow teenagers as young as 14 to work in nonhazardous jobs. The legal age to work in a garment factory is a bit unclear. Mr. Mahmud, the fire official, said garment factories were not supposed to hire anyone younger than 18; others say the age limit is 16. Several of the fire victims were 16 or 17, according to their families, while labor groups say one victim was only 15. \nMoyna Akter, 20, had worked in the factory for two months before quitting. But her younger sister, Kohinur, kept working, as a helper, earning as little as $30 a month. She died in the fire.\n\u201cI will not work anymore for any garment factory,\u201d Moyna Akter said.\nSeveral workers remain hospitalized with injuries from the fire, including at least one in critical condition. Yet local labor advocates say that the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, a powerful industry trade group, has refused to provide assistance to the injured, since the burned factory was not a member of the group.\nOne of the injured workers, Samsur Nahar, is said to be unconscious and suffering seizures at Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Family members say she is being kept in a ward so crowded that she does not have a bed.",

    "text": "U.S. Retailers Decline to Aid Factory Victims in Bangladesh\n2013-11-23T01:17:53.000Z\nOne year after the Tazreen factory fire in Bangladesh, many retailers that sold garments produced there or inside the Rana Plaza building that collapsed last spring are refusing to join an effort to compensate the families of the more than 1,200 workers who died in those disasters.\nThe International Labor Organization is working with Bangladeshi officials, labor groups and several retailers to create ambitious compensation funds to assist not just the families of the dead, but also more than 1,800 workers who were injured, some of them still hospitalized.\nA handful of retailers \u2014 led by Primark, an Anglo-Irish company, and C&A, a Dutch-German company \u2014 are deeply involved in getting long-term compensation funds off the ground, one for Rana Plaza\u2019s victims and one for the victims of the Tazreen fire, which killed 112 workers last Nov. 24.\nBut to the dismay of those pushing to create the compensation funds, neither Walmart, Sears, Children\u2019s Place nor any of the other American companies that were selling goods produced at Tazreen or Rana Plaza have agreed to contribute to the efforts.\nSupporters of compensation plans say they are needed to pay for medical care for those who are paralyzed or otherwise badly injured, to provide income after a vital breadwinner died and to give families enough income so that children are not forced to quit school and go to work.\n\u201cCompensation is so important because so many families are suffering \u2014 many families don\u2019t have anyone left to support them,\u201d said Kalpona Akter, executive director of the Bangladesh Center for Worker Solidarity. \u201cThere\u2019s been a good response from some European brands, but so far none of the U.S. retailers have agreed to pay a single penny for compensation.\u201d\nPaul Lister, Primark\u2019s general counsel, said that from the day Rana Plaza collapsed, his company recognized its responsibility. Primark, which says it has already spent more than $3.2 million for aid to the victims, first provided several weeks\u2019 emergency food assistance to 1,300 families, then short-term financial aid and now it is working to develop a compensation fund to help victims for years, even decades.\n\u201cWe knew we were having clothes made in Rana Plaza \u2014 we announced that on the first day,\u201d Mr. Lister said about the April 24 building collapse, which killed 1,129 workers. \u201cWhen you know where your clothes are made, then you take responsibility for the results of where your clothes are being made. We have said very clearly that we would work to support the workers \u2014 and the families of the workers \u2014 in our supply chain.\u201d\nPrimark, whose brands include Atmosphere and Denim Company, was a major customer of New Wave Bottoms, one of the five garment factories inside Rana Plaza. For the last six months, Primark has paid the salaries for not just that factory\u2019s 550 workers but for all 3,600 Bangladeshis who worked inside the building. After setting up a series of help desks for Rana Plaza workers and families to register, Primark paid the salaries to surviving workers or families of the dead.\nPrimark has also pledged to pay another three months\u2019 salary if no other company steps up, but Loblaw, a Canadian retailer that makes the Joe Fresh brand, has agreed to join that effort. Primark says it has paid somewhat more than the $38-a-month minimum wage for each worker, totaling at least $136,000 a month.\nBob Chant, Loblaw\u2019s senior vice president for corporate affairs, said, \u201cWe believe we have a moral obligation to support the workers who are producing our products. Our chairman has voiced disappointment that more brands haven\u2019t stepped up.\u201d\nPrimark, Benetton, Loblaw and El Corte Ingles are working closely with the International Labor Organization to set up what would be one of the largest industrial compensation funds in history \u2014 one with perhaps $70 million to help the long-term needs of the Rana Plaza survivors and families. Advocates are urging more than 20 European and American retailers to commit money for compensation.\nThere are precedents for such a fund \u2014 after 29 workers died in the Hameem garment factory in Bangladesh in December 2010, Gap, J. C. Penney and Target joined other retailers in paying into a modest compensation fund.\nEven as labor advocates single out Primark for praise, they single out Walmart for criticism \u2014 partly because production documents recovered after the Tazreen fire indicate that two months before that fire erupted, 55 percent of the factory\u2019s production was being made for Walmart contractors. Walmart has repeatedly been asked to contribute to the anticipated $6 million compensation program for Tazreen survivors and families.\n\u201cWalmart is the one company that is showing an astonishing lack of responsibility, considering that so much of their product was being made at the Tazreen factory,\u201d said Samantha Maher, a campaign coordinator for the British arm of the Clean Clothes Campaign, a European anti-sweatshop group.\nWalmart has also been asked to contribute to the planned Rana Plaza fund because production documents were found in the building rubble indicating that a Canadian contractor was producing jeans for Walmart in 2012 at the Ether Tex factory inside the building. Walmart said that unauthorized contractors were producing garments without the company\u2019s knowledge.\nAfter the International Labor Rights Forum, an advocacy group based in Washington, wrote to Walmart to urge its participation in the compensation efforts, Rajan Kamalanathan, Walmart\u2019s vice president for ethical sourcing, responded in an email that Walmart did not intend to participate. He wrote that \u201cthere was no production for Walmart in Rana Plaza at the time of the tragedy\u201d and that the Walmart-related production at Tazreen was unauthorized.\nIn that email, made available by the labor rights forum, Mr. Kamalanathan made clear that Walmart was looking to the future: \u201cOur focus is to positively impact global supply chain practices both by raising our own standards and by partnering with other stakeholders to improve the standards for workers across the industry. We will continue to invest our resources in proactive programs that will address fire and building safety in the garment and textile industry in Bangladesh to help prevent tragedies before they happen.\u201d\nAsked whether Walmart would contribute to a compensation fund, Kevin Gardner, a company spokesman, repeated part of Mr. Kamalanathan\u2019s statement verbatim.\nThe Children\u2019s Place, which had used one of the factories inside Rana Plaza, but said that factory was not supplying it when the building collapsed, declined to comment about contributing.\nAsked whether Sears would provide monetary aid for Tazreen victims, Howard Riefs, a company spokesman, did not indicate an intention to do so, but said his company \u201cremains committed to improving conditions in the factories we utilize for production of our merchandise.\u201d\nSears said an unauthorized contractor had been producing on its behalf at Tazreen. With Walmart and 24 other American and Canadian companies, Sears has joined an alliance to upgrade factory safety in Bangladesh.\nSome industry analysts say Walmart, Sears and other American retailers are reluctant to join the compensation efforts because they fear it could be seen as an admission of wrongdoing, perhaps leading to legal liability. Some also say the Americans fear they will look hypocritical if they contribute to a compensation fund after they asserted that any production done for them in those factories was unauthorized.\nAdvocates hope that the compensation plans will soon take effect, replacing the short-term financial aid from Primark and Loblaw. The Bangladeshi government and Bangladeshi manufacturers are also being asked to contribute, and the size of the funds would be based on a formula that takes into account the level of workers\u2019 wages, the extent of survivors\u2019 injuries and the number of years employees would have worked had they not been killed or injured.",

    "text": "Last Hope in Ruins: Bangladesh\u2019s Race to Save Shaheena\n2013-05-05T19:40:43.000Z\nSAVAR, Bangladesh \u2014 The rescuers discovered her by a faint, distant sound. They had spent four days crawling through the wreckage of Rana Plaza, tons of concrete and steel pressing down, saving hundreds of people. Now only the dead remained. Except for a lone woman, a garment worker.\nShe was trapped behind a fallen pillar, in a suffocating crevice maybe two feet high. First, the rescuers could see only her fingertips pressing through a tiny opening. After hours spent chipping a small hole, they could see her face. Her name was Shaheena. She was 32. She begged to see her young son.\nThe story of Shaheena, involving a heroic if ultimately doomed rescue operation, offered the last bit of hope of finding anyone alive in what is now considered the deadliest accident in the history of the garment industry. For hours on April 28, as television reporters broadcast updates, rescuing Shaheena became a national priority. She would be trapped for more than 100 hours.\nHer plight attracted so much attention because of the horror of the building collapse, with a death toll that by Sunday had exceeded 600; the drama of the long rescue effort; and the human desire to find a sliver of redemption in the tragedy. But the attention was also an anomaly: there are easily more than 2.5 million women working in the garment industry in Bangladesh whose lives usually attract scant notice, even though they are the workhorses of the national economy.\nFor women like Shaheena, the garment industry has been a source of empowerment as well as exploitation. Before, few rural women worked outside the fields in Bangladesh, a predominantly Muslim nation. Many, like Shaheena, are still not given a surname at birth. Now the industry has given many women a first step out of rural distress, with some becoming outspoken labor leaders or managers in their factories. \nBut more often, a factory job has meant a daily struggle to subsist on low wages consumed by rising rents and living expenses. The day before Rana Plaza collapsed on April 24, the five factories inside the building were temporarily closed when cracks were discovered in the structure. But relatives say Shaheena insisted on returning to work at her factory, Phantom Tec, even as her brother-in-law warned that the building might be unsafe.\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t go to work tomorrow, I\u2019ll be absent, and I will not get paid for the day,\u201d Shaheena said that afternoon, according to her sister, Jesmine Akhtar. \u201cThey may delay my month\u2019s wages. I need to pay the rent. I need to buy milk for my son.\u201d\nHer immediate concern was $25. She and her son had lived with her sister\u2019s family in an area called Mojidpur. They were seven people sharing two small rooms with a monthly rent of $56. Even that was too much, so the families found a place for $38 a month. Everyone had moved except Shaheena; she still needed to find $25 for her share of the advance.\nHer family said that her job had given Shaheena a sense of independence. She gave herself a surname, the same as her sister\u2019s. She left her husband when she was three months pregnant with her son, Robin, because, her family said, he mistreated her. Yet that meant that she was now the only breadwinner, despite earning barely $100 a month after a decade working in factories.\n\u201cThere were so many nights she worked even until midnight,\u201d her sister recalled. \u201cShe needed money.\u201d\nThe morning shift had barely started inside Rana Plaza on April 24 when the building buckled. A day earlier, an engineer had examined the cracks and warned that the building should stay closed, but the building\u2019s owner, Sohel Rana, and the factory bosses opened that morning, anyway. Then entire factory floors collapsed, raining down concrete beams. Some people died instantly. Others would lose hands or legs to amputation during their rescue or afterward. And hundreds of others were trapped alive, desperate for water in choking, triple-digit temperatures, and desperate to be saved.\nKhandoker A. Jalil, a senior station officer with the Bangladesh Fire Service, led one rescue team. To reach survivors, rescue crews cut holes in the fallen rooftop and began climbing down into the wreckage, establishing tunnels and slithering through tiny crawl spaces created by huge rolls of fabric that had blocked the collapsing beams.\nLate on April 26, the third day of searching, Officer Jalil\u2019s team discovered 13 survivors, as well as some haunting sounds. \u201cWe heard some people from the other side,\u201d he recalled.\nFor more than a day, they would search for those voices, sliding through narrow passages, cutting holes to lower floors. Finally, they reached a crawl space barely 18 inches high, and the sound of the voices was sharper.\n\u201cI asked, How many of you are there?\u201d recalled Abu Yusef, one of the firefighters. A woman answered: \u201cThere are four of us.\u201d\nAnother firefighter, Abdur Rob, shined his flashlight beneath small openings under the beam. Do you see a light? he asked. No, came the answer. Here? No. And then, finally, yes. They slipped a wire through the small crack below. Shaheena pulled back.\nIt was now early in the afternoon of April 27. Outside, officials were readying heavy machinery to clear debris and reach the rest of the bodies. But then word went to the rooftop: the last survivors had been found.\nShaheena\u2019s family had searched for her since the building had collapsed but found nothing for four days. Then neighbors heard something on television and contacted the family.\n\u201cWe heard that the rescuers were trying to save her,\u201d said her father, Abdul Motaleb Golder, 72. \u201cThey said Shaheena wants to survive.\u201d\nEventually, the three other trapped women would fall silent. But as rescuers worked for more than 20 hours, Shaheena kept talking. \u201cHer concern was that during the last four days she couldn\u2019t hold her baby,\u201d said Lt. Ashraful Alam Anik, one of the commandos involved in the rescue operation. \u201cShe wanted to see her child.\u201d\nRobin, who is now 20 months old, spent most of his time with his aunt, since his mother worked such long hours. On the night Robin was born, Shaheena worked until hours before giving birth and then returned to the sewing line two months later.\nShifts of rescuers changed, twice. The same firefighters who discovered her returned on April 28 to try to finish digging her out. The fallen pillar was embedded with iron rods, or rebar, that were difficult to cut in such a cramped space. So the rescuers decided to chip away at the bottom of the pillar, below the rods, and then try to cut a gap in the floor below.\nThey pushed an oxygen tube through the opening, and used another tube to give her saline, glucose and juice. When the hole expanded, they gave her hard biscuits. When the heat became oppressive, they cooled her with bursts from a high-pressure hose. At one point, she took a saw and hammer and began working, too, lying on her back, barely able to maneuver.\nFinally, by the evening of April 28, the hole was nearly big enough. Shaheena could slide her head through, rescuers said, but not her shoulders and chest. Only a few rods in the flooring needed to be cut to make room, a job that might take an hour. Outside, thousands of people had gathered at the site as television reporters relayed the progress.\n\u201cThe whole nation was looking for that lady,\u201d said Maj. Mostafa Arif, an army officer involved in the operation.\nInside the wreckage, a civil engineer who had joined the rescue team thought he could cut through the final iron rods with a small electric grinder. A mistake. In the narrow crawl space, sparks splattered against the rolls of fabric and the shirts strewn on the floor. Fire.\n\u201cThe tunnel is dark,\u201d recalled Capt. Mahmudul Hasan, another army officer at the scene. \u201cBut suddenly we saw light coming at us.\u201d\nThe rescuers scrambled up to the roof, some fainting from the smoke. The civil engineer suffered severe burns and has since died. When the rescuers later recovered her body, Shaheena was not burned; presumably she died from smoke inhalation.\n\u201cWe were so upset,\u201d said Abdur Rob, the firefighter. \u201cWe had only 1 percent of the work to finish. But at the end, everything was ruined. We broke into tears.\u201d\nOver the weekend, as work crews continued pulling out bodies, Jesmine Akhtar held tightly to her sister\u2019s only child. He is wide-eyed and giggling and does not yet know that his mother is dead. \u201cI will take care of Robin,\u201d his aunt declared. \u201cI had three children. Now I have four. He will be with me the rest of my life.\u201d",

    "text": "After Bangladesh Factory Collapse, Bleak Struggle for Survivors\n2013-12-19T02:53:07.000Z\nSAVAR, Bangladesh \u2014 Inside the single room he shares with his wife and young child, Hasan Mahmud Forkan does not sleep easily. Some nights he hears the screams of the garment workers he tried to rescue from the wreckage of the Rana Plaza factory building. Or he dreams the bed itself is collapsing, sucking him down into a bottomless void.\nA few miles away, at a rehabilitation center for the disabled, Rehana Khatun is learning to walk again. She lost both legs in the Rana Plaza collapse and worries that she is not improving because her prosthetic replacements are bulky and uncomfortable. She is only 20 and once hoped to save money so she could return to her village and pay for her own wedding.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t have that dream anymore,\u201d she said, with a cold pragmatism more than self-pity. \u201cHow can I take care of a family?\u201d\nEight months ago, the collapse of Rana Plaza became the deadliest disaster in the history of the garment industry, and many of the survivors still face an uncertain future. The shoddily constructed building pancaked down onto workers stitching clothes for global brands like Children\u2019s Place, Benetton, Primark and many others. Workers earning as little as $38 a month were crushed under tons of falling concrete and steel. More than 1,100 people died and many others were injured or maimed.\nBut while the Rana Plaza disaster stirred an international outcry \u2014 and shamed many international clothing companies into pledging to help finance safety improvements in other Bangladeshi factories \u2014 the people most directly affected are still living without any guarantees of help or financial compensation.\nFamilies who lost the wages of a son or daughter, husband or wife, are struggling.\nThose who lost limbs, like Ms. Khatun, are uncertain if they will ever walk or hold things again. And many volunteer rescuers like Mr. Forkan and survivors are struggling to deal with debilitating emotional scars.\nToday, Rana Plaza no longer exists. It is a gaping hole in a busy commercial street, mostly cleared of rubble, where rainwater has pooled into a small black lake. But the vacant space still exerts the potency of memory and loss. Banners demanding justice face the street. Sit-ins or small protests are sometimes held. Leftist parties have built a crude statue of a hammer and sickle.\nThere are also people, often hovering near the periphery, clutching official documents, proof of their loss, evidence of their claims for compensation. In a poor country like Bangladesh, a job in a garment factory, despite the low wages, is a financial toehold for many families. A daughter is sent to work to support her parents, or to pay to school her siblings.\nNow it is the parents or siblings who come to the Rana Plaza site, trying to get attention and, they hope, financial assistance.\n\u201cWe are a poor family,\u201d said Monju Ara, 40, whose daughter Smriti, 17, died while working on the third floor of Rana Plaza. \u201cThat is why my daughter had to start work. Her wages helped us educate our younger children. Now we had to stop educating them.\u201d\nMs. Monju Ara stood in a dirt alleyway beside the Rana Plaza site on a recent afternoon, as others soon appeared. One girl, Rahima, 9, was still carrying a \u201cmissing\u201d poster for her brother. Another child, Smriti Mahmuda, 7, had lost her father, and her 15-year-old brother had taken a job in an embroidery factory to support the family. A rickshaw driver with the single name of Alauddin, 43, is now struggling to support his young daughter after his wife died in Rana Plaza.\n\u201cThey always say I will get compensation,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they don\u2019t say when.\u201d\nCompensation remains a complicated and contested issue. Bangladesh\u2019s government has made some modest short-term compensation payments to some victims. Families were given a one-time payment of $257 when they collected the body of a relative in the days after the collapse, and the government has established annuities for survivors who lost limbs \u2014 Ms. Khatun gets about $206 a month in interest, more than most others.\nBut much of the money donated to the government for the survivors and the families of the dead has not been released. Many of these claimants have been told that full compensation packages will be provided after the process of identifying all the dead is completed. A special committee appointed by the Bangladesh High Court has suggested individual compensation packages of roughly $25,000; lobbyists for factory owners are proposing a far lower figure. The final decision is expected to rest with the high court.\nFor now, most of the short-term compensation has come from the British chain Primark, which has been paying salaries for survivors and families of those who died. More recently, Loblaw, a Canadian retailer, announced that it, too, would step in to help with compensation.\nThe Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, the powerful industry trade group, has also provided compensation, according to some survivors who received a few months\u2019 salary.\nBut the long-term picture remains muddled. Other companies have so far refused to participate in a long-term compensation package, including all of the American brands, but for many Rana Plaza survivors, the short-term compensation is already running out. Shukrani, who survived the collapse but lost a daughter, who was working on a different floor, is almost out of money.\n\u201cMy other daughter had appendicitis,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to spend part of my money for her operation. Now I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll survive.\u201d\nDown the road from Rana Plaza, at the Center for the Rehabilitation of the Paralyzed, Ms. Khatun and others spend their mornings trying to learn how to walk or hold a pen with prosthetics. The nonprofit organization has a long history of helping the disabled and is now helping several Rana Plaza survivors learn how to use the prosthetics provided by another donor.\nBut the prosthetics are a problem: One man, Saddam Hossain, 27, who was a salesman in a building adjacent to Rana Plaza, lost his right arm. He had been studying for a graduate degree in economics and, after his amputation, still took the test in June, with someone else writing his answers for him. Now he is trying to adjust to his mechanical prosthetic arm, which is clumsier than Western models.\n\u201cI\u2019m an educated man,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to do a job.\u201d\nMs. Khatun is grateful for her prosthetic legs but is also struggling with them. She has practiced for two months but finds them painful. Her legs were amputated above the knee, making it more difficult. She will need walking sticks, and she has decided to leave the chaos of the city and return to her village. There, though, the roads are muddy and difficult to traverse.\nShe had left the village after her mother tried to arrange her marriage. The cost of a wedding would have bankrupted her family, so she came to Savar and found work in Rana Plaza. She thought she could save up to pay for her own wedding and also educate her younger brothers.\n\u201cI dreamed that I could see my mother smiling,\u201d she said. \u201cNow it is meaningless to talk about what my dreams are. I cannot lead a life like normal people. I will have an unusual, different life.\u201d\nBefore the Rana Plaza disaster, many of the workers were already living on the margins. Few had much education and most struggled to get by on the low wages. They were not qualified to do much else but work in a sewing factory. But now, for many, merely stepping back into a factory incites anxiety.\nMohammad Ujjal Hossain, 30, spent three days trapped under a wall of fallen concrete. When rescuers found him, he handed them his cellphone and told them to call his mother to tell her he was alive.\n\u201cNow, I\u2019m not doing anything,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI went to a factory to work as a line chief. I worked for a day, but I was filled with fear when I was inside the building. I worried that this building would also collapse. I quit after that day.\u201d\nAnd of all those whose lives are now entwined with Rana Plaza, it is the volunteer rescuers, ordinary people who rushed forward in a crisis, who have received no financial help at all. Mr. Forkan, 37, spent three weeks helping firefighters and soldiers pull bodies out of the rubble. He crawled into the wreckage and freed one woman by cutting an iron rod that pierced deep into her leg.\nBut when it was over, Mr. Forkan found it difficult to return to his ordinary life.\nHe is an electrician and regularly works in dangerous situations. But he finds it difficult to concentrate. He deliberately avoids the Rana Plaza site, detouring around it, and his wife often has to wake him when he shouts in his sleep.\n\u201cWe need proper treatment to return to a normal life,\u201d he said, expressing concern about what would happen to his family if he could no longer work. \u201cThis is my only way to earn money.\u201d",

    "text": "Wal-Mart Toughens Fire Safety Rules for Suppliers After Bangladesh Blaze\n2013-01-23T02:30:00.000Z\nFacing criticism for selling garments made at a Bangladesh factory where 112 workers died in a fire last November, Wal-Mart Stores told its worldwide suppliers Tuesday that it was adopting tougher rules on fire safety at its contractors and would have \u201czero tolerance\u201d for suppliers that used unauthorized subcontractors. \nAt least two suppliers were using the Tazreen Fashions factory in Bangladesh to produce garments for Wal-Mart in the weeks before the fire there. After the fatal blaze, Wal-Mart said those suppliers had used the factory without its knowledge after it had stopped authorizing production there. It did not say why. Wal-Mart said it had ended its relationship with those two suppliers. \nIn a letter sent to its suppliers on Tuesday, Wal-Mart said they must \u201cfully and accurately disclose\u201d in advance any factories they or any of their subcontractors plan to use. Under the policy, suppliers will be subject to termination even if an undisclosed factory is used \u201cwithout the supplier\u2019s knowledge\u201d by anyone in the supplier\u2019s supply chain. David Schilling, a program director at the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility, praised the move, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s an important step toward increased transparency and accountability of suppliers.\u201d\nWal-Mart also announced tougher requirements on fire safety, saying \u201cfacilities found to have fire safety-related violations must initiate corrective actions immediately.\u201d The company said that the repairs must be completed no later than 30 days after the violations were identified.\nThree inspection reports that worker advocates found at the Tazreen factory after the fire showed that it had serious, continuing fire safety violations from May 2011 through April 2012.\nWal-Mart also told its suppliers that if they want to use additional factories, those factories will be required to \u201cprequalify,\u201d meaning they must first pass ethical sourcing standards on fire safety and other criteria. \nSome labor rights groups said Wal-Mart\u2019s new policy did not go nearly far enough.\nScott Nova, executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a monitoring group financed by American universities, said: \u201cThere are giant gaps. There is no commitment on covering the costs of the fire safety repairs and renovations that we all know are necessary.\u201d\n\u201cThere is also no real transparency,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way of knowing for two months, six months, a year, what the inspection reports find, and they won\u2019t tell the workers the results of the inspections at their factories.\u201d\nBrooke Buchanan, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, said the company would publicize the names of factories dropped for noncompliance. But she said there were no plans to list or publicize the names of all the factories that Wal-Mart and its suppliers use \u2014 something that worker rights groups have advocated to make it easier to monitor factories. \nTo help suppliers finance needed safety improvements, Wal-Mart is considering participating in a revolving fund that would provide loans to Bangladeshi factory owners, Ms. Buchanan said.\nThe letter to suppliers was first reported Tuesday by The Wall Street Journal.\nWal-Mart said all of its Bangladesh factories must have an \u201celectrical and building safety assessment\u201d by an independent, certified agency. Since 2005, factory fires in Bangladesh, many caused by electrical problems, have killed 600 workers. \nAfter the Tazreen fire, many surviving workers said the eight-story factory had barred windows that prevented workers from escaping. In its new rules, Wal-Mart said any barred windows must have an emergency mechanism to allow for escape. \nWal-Mart also told its suppliers, \u201cAll floors and buildings, including dormitories, must have a secondary exit, and preferably an external fire escape route.\u201d \nBut Mr. Nova voiced dismay that Wal-Mart\u2019s new policy did not explicitly require fireproof staircases or external fire escapes in multistory factories. \u201cThe failure to have such effective means to exit was an important reason so many workers died at Tazreen,\u201d he said. Ms. Buchanan said she expected inspectors to call for such measures when visiting multistory factories. \nDara O\u2019Rourke, a specialist on labor policy at the University of California, Berkeley, praised Wal-Mart\u2019s new requirement that fire safety violations be addressed immediately. \u201cThis is a critical step towards motivating factories to fix the problems they find in audits,\u201d he said.\nWal-Mart is also requiring factories to have proper access for fire trucks and firefighting equipment, and that suppliers have a worker in each country where they operate responsible for ensuring factory compliance.",

    "text": "The Impending Deluge\n2013-05-31T11:53:26.000Z\nFifty thousand drowned, steamships aground with their bows among trees, cattle rolled head over heels by gigantic waves \u2014 stories of great sea surges from past centuries abound. Many of them cascaded ashore when coastlines were relatively stable, killing everyone in their path. Today, we live in a warming world of rising sea levels, where tens of millions of us live a few meters above the ocean. The potential for sudden cataclysm is greater than ever.\nThe record of history is sobering. On Jan. 16, 1362, a severe southwesterly storm swept across the British Isles. The wooden spire of Norwich cathedral in eastern England collapsed. \nHours later, the Grote Mandrenke, \u201cThe Great Killing of Men,\u201d descended on the Low Countries at high tide. Huge waves carried everything before them. \u201cAn infinity of people perished,\u201d fishing fleets became matchwood, entire herds of cattle and sheep perished in the raging waters. Three centuries later, in 1634, another cataclysmic storm surge brought sea levels four meters above normal to the Strand Islands off northern Germany. As many as 15,000 people and 50,000 livestock drowned. \nThese were but two of the savage attacks on the low-lying coasts of the North Sea, this from a patch of ocean that was largely dry land less than 8,000 years ago. The geologists call it Doggerland, a sunken landscape that once formed the North Sea. It was a land of sluggish rivers, lakes and extensive wetlands. A few thousand hunters thrived there, living off fish and small game, using antler-tipped spears. \nWe know this because a trawler dredged one from the seabed in 1932. Doggerland slowly vanished in the face of sea level rise caused by thawing ice sheets, an ever-changing world for those who lived there. By 5,500 B.C., Doggerland had disappeared under the chilly waters of the North Sea. \nThe inhabitants of the Low Countries have been battling the ocean ever since. For over a thousand years, they have tried to wall off the ocean. Today, millions of people live in densely occupied coastal landscapes behind great barriers. The Dutch government\u2019s hideously expensive Delta Works was the culmination of centuries of defense work, but the authorities never relax in the face of a warming future with predictions of more extreme weather events. They are planning for at least 10,000-year storms in a world of rising sea levels. \nIt\u2019s hard for us to imagine what the world was like at the end of the Ice Age, when sea levels were about 220 meters lower and the North Sea was dry land.\nTake the Nile, which flowed into the Mediterranean through narrow gorges. As the ocean rose, the now silt-heavy Nile formed a fertile delta that became the granary of the pharaohs. All was well two thousand years ago, when Alexandria had only 300,000 inhabitants. Today, the Aswan Dam far upstream has drastically reduced silt flow. Nearly 10 million people live in Alexandria and Cairo. The delta is slowly vanishing under rising sea levels, its groundwater contaminated by saltwater, the soils depleted. The delta is no longer a balanced system. Perhaps 7 million people will suffer regularly from starvation by 2100. \nThe world\u2019s sea levels have risen since the 1860s, with no end in sight. Skeptics argue that this is a long-term problem, measured in centuries rather than generations, that there is plenty of time to adapt to changing shorelines. But they forget about the more frequent extreme-weather events with their sea surges predicted for the future. \nHurricane Katrina in 2005 and Superstorm Sandy in 2012 were both wake-up calls for Americans living near sea level. Katrina devastated New Orleans, leaving 80 percent of the city underwater. Levees broke, over 1,500 people died, and thousands were stranded, especially poorer people. Sandy\u2019s surge flooded Lower Manhattan and the New Jersey Shore. Subways flooded, thousands of houses became rubble. With $60 billion of damage, recovery will take years, while a debate over long-term solutions sputters along. Does one wall off New York, force people to build on higher ground, or restore protective mangrove swamps? The answers will be long in coming, but meanwhile, as cities like Miami grow, our vulnerability increases every year. \nThe threat is even more ominous elsewhere. Today, some 200 million people live within five meters of sea level, many of them in megacities like Shanghai. The Netherlands has the resources to wall off the sea, but what about other parts of the world? Small Pacific islands like Tuvalu, Alaska\u2019s barrier island communities, and the Maldives in the Indian Ocean are seriously endangered and may even cease to exist. \nBangladesh, most of which is river delta country, lies at the head of the Bay of Bengal, where intense cyclones and their fast-moving storm surges have the potential to kill thousands. And kill they do, in a country with an exploding population, chronic poverty and a long coastline. Cyclone Bhola in 1970 killed over half a million people, at a time when the population was much smaller than today. To its credit, the government has developed early warning systems, erected refuge buildings, and created evacuation strategies that have saved many lives. But these do not answer the longer-term problem of fast-growing urban populations, threats to rice crops, seawater contaminated groundwater, and nowhere to move millions of people forced from their homes by rising seas.\nTen millennia ago, the inhabitants of Doggerland could adjust effortlessly to a changing world. Today, we are catastrophically vulnerable to attacks from the rising ocean and its tempests. \nFor the first time, we may have to confront the problem of permanent environmental refugees. This will require unprecedented levels of international cooperation and funding, and so far unformulated policies to handle millions of involuntary fugitives from the ocean. We face a long-term challenge that will stress all of our deep reservoirs of innovation and ingenuity.\n  Brian Fagan is emeritus professor of anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and author of the forthcoming \u201cThe Attacking Ocean: The Past, Present and Future of Rising Sea Levels.\u201d ",

    "text": "Two Leaders\u2019 Enmity Stokes Concern Over Vote in Fragile Democracy\n2013-12-04T23:53:43.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 The two ladies, as they are often known, had not spoken in years when aides arranged a telephone call recently in hopes of resolving the mounting political crisis in Bangladesh. The caller was Sheikh Hasina, the prime minister. The recipient was Begum Khaleda Zia, the leader of the political opposition.\n\u201cI called you around noon \u2014 you didn\u2019t pick up,\u201d began Mrs. Hasina, leader of the governing Awami League, according to a transcript published in The Dhaka Tribune, an English-language newspaper.\n\u201cThis is not correct,\u201d said Mrs. Zia, leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party.\n\u201cI want to inform you that \u2014\u2014\u201d the prime minister resumed.\n\u201cYou have to listen to me first,\u201d snapped Mrs. Zia, herself a former prime minister. \u201cYou said you called me, but I didn\u2019t get any call around the time you mentioned.\u201d\nAnd so it went, in an acrimonious conversation that titillated Bangladeshi political circles but did nothing to resolve a crisis that is now bringing bloodshed and daily street violence across the country. The poisonous rivalry between the two leaders has created a dangerous impasse, eliciting growing international concern, as both women engage in a bitter game to become the next prime minister.\nThe issue is whether the two can agree on how the coming elections will be conducted. For nearly two years, Mrs. Zia and other opposition leaders have demanded that Mrs. Hasina and her government step down shortly before the parliamentary elections so that an impartial caretaker government can oversee the polling \u2014 as Bangladesh has done on several occasions. If not, Mrs. Zia says her party will not participate in the elections.\nBut Mrs. Hasina has refused, arguing that Bangladesh\u2019s institutions are stable enough to conduct elections and that she is merely abiding by the national Constitution. That is where things now stand, with neither leader willing to budge, even as the damage to the country rises.\n\u201cCommon sense decrees that the two ladies should work out a compromise,\u201d said a senior Bangladeshi diplomat and longtime political observer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of angering either of the two leaders. \u201cAt the moment, the country is paying a big price in law and order.\u201d\nWhen Bangladesh\u2019s chief election commissioner last week fixed Jan. 5 as the date for national elections, the response was grimly predictable. Men rushed into the streets to set cars on fire, and soon the wailing horns of police cruisers and fire trucks blared through the darkened capital. Since Nov. 26, at least two dozen people have died across the country as the Bangladesh Nationalist Party has staged nationwide strikes, blocking roads and train trestles, to protest the elections.\nThroughout the year, Mrs. Zia\u2019s opposition party has pressed its demands through these strikes, known as hartals, which have inflicted growing damage on the national economy. This sort of ritualized protest, leavened with violence, is common in Bangladesh: In 1996, the roles were reversed as Mrs. Hasina was in the opposition and Mrs. Zia was prime minister. Then it was workers in Mrs. Hasina\u2019s party who staged strikes to pressure Mrs. Zia to bring in a caretaker government for elections.\nBangladesh\u2019s democracy is already fragile, shadowed by a legacy of military rule, and analysts agree that it is imperative to hold fair, inclusive elections next month. The caretaker government system has been used several times in Bangladesh, including in 1991, when the country was emerging from a long period of military rule. But it was abused in 2007, when the military took control. Mrs. Hasina was elected in December 2008, and her party, following a court ruling, abolished the caretaker system three years later, infuriating the opposition.\nThis week, India, the United States and the United Nations are scheduled to send envoys to Dhaka in the hopes of mediating a solution to the crisis. The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has already tried to personally break the impasse, while the assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia affairs, Nisha Desai Biswal, used a visit to Dhaka last week to push for a compromise.\n\u201cWe think the time is nigh for an urgent dialogue to take place,\u201d Ms. Biswal said at a news conference. \u201cThere must be some means for parties to come together and discuss their differences, to discuss their expectations and to find the way forward.\u201d\nBut the mistrust traces back to Bangladesh\u2019s inception as an independent nation, after a bloody 1971 war of liberation from Pakistan. After the war, Mrs. Hasina\u2019s father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, became prime minister and president; he was assassinated in 1975, along with Mrs. Hasina\u2019s mother and 10-year-old brother. The next president was Ziaur Rahman, a military officer who founded the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. His wife, Mrs. Zia, became the party\u2019s leader after her husband was assassinated in 1981.\nIt is that interwoven history, stained with blood and recriminations, that still hangs over Bangladesh. Throughout the year, a special tribunal convened to prosecute war criminals from the 1971 conflict has inflamed tensions, as verdicts have been handed down against several leaders of Jamaat-e-Islami, the country\u2019s largest Islamic political party.\nInternational groups have criticized the war crimes tribunal for flouting due process, while Jamaat leaders have accused the government of politicizing the process. Jamaat, in turn, has unleashed violent protests and pledged to conduct a nationwide rampage if their convicted leaders are executed. Further stoking the anger, Bangladesh\u2019s High Court in August deregistered Jamaat as a political party, effectively banning it from participating in elections.\nIt is a potent and toxic political situation that could have worrisome results: If a compromise is not reached on the elections and Mrs. Zia refuses to participate, the Awami League is certain to sweep to victory. Far less certain is whether the public will regard the results as legitimate. Much will depend on turnout; if more than half the electorate participates, Mrs. Hasina will have more solid footing to claim public support.\nBut turnout could be far lower, which many analysts say could usher in a period of political instability, as opponents would most likely take to the streets to demand a new round of voting. That raises the possibility that the Bangladeshi military, in the name of national stability, might declare a state of emergency.\nIn a largely Muslim nation like Bangladesh, religion is a powerful subtext to elections. Mrs. Hasina and the Awami League promote a more secular vision for the country, while Mrs. Zia has spoken in the past of a need for a government that protects Islam. Bangladesh remains a poor country, but one that has achieved real progress. Health indexes have improved markedly, and income per capita has risen.\nBut the continuing political violence is damaging the economy and alienating the public. Last week, one person died and several were injured when opposition protesters set fire to a bus. Business leaders are calling for a political compromise, as the violence has shut down factories and other commerce. Leaders in the country\u2019s powerful garment industry say the strikes have caused delays in meeting deadlines and may deter foreign investors.\nYet, in the end, it will all come down to the \u201ctwo ladies,\u201d and whether they can look past their bitter history and find a way to hold an election on Jan. 5.",

    "text": "U.S. Retailers See Big Risk in Safety Plan for Factories in Bangladesh\n2013-05-23T01:09:31.000Z\nAmerican retailers remain sharply opposed to joining an international plan to improve safety conditions at garment factories in Bangladesh as their European counterparts and consumer and labor groups dismiss the companies\u2019 concerns about legal liability.\nA few shareholders at Gap\u2019s annual meeting this week questioned the company\u2019s refusal to sign on to a plan that commits retailers to help finance safety upgrades in Bangladesh, where 1,127 workers died when the Rana Plaza factory building collapsed on April 24.\n\u201cIn the United States, there\u2019s maybe a bigger legal risk than there is in Europe,\u201d Gap\u2019s chief executive, Glenn Murphy, responded. \u201cIf we were to sign onto something that had unlimited legal liability and risk, I think our shareholders should care about that.\u201d\nWhether the new accord would subject retailers to substantial legal risks has been debated since nearly three dozen European retailers embraced the plan last week while almost all major American companies shunned it. The plan, called the Accord on Factory and Building Safety in Bangladesh, was forged by retailers, union leaders and government officials overseas.\nLabor advocacy groups and other supporters of the plan pilloried the responses by Gap, Wal-Mart and other American retailers that have decided to rely on their own inspection systems rather than join the plan.\nJohan Lubbe, a legal adviser to the National Retail Federation, asserts that the Americans\u2019 worries about litigation are legitimate. \u201cThe liability issue is of great concern, at least on this side of the Atlantic,\u201d Mr. Lubbe said. \u201cFor U.S. corporations, there is a fear that someone will try to impose liability and responsibility if something goes awry in the global supply chain.\u201d\nFor example, if a Bangladesh factory burns and workers die, the victims\u2019 families, represented by zealous American lawyers, might seize on the legal commitments in the accord to file lawsuits in the United States against retailers that bought apparel from the factory.\nJohn C. Coffee Jr., a professor of corporate law at Columbia University, said American companies generally faced a higher risk of litigation than overseas competitors, largely because the court systems differ significantly. Unlike the system in the United States, courts in Europe generally prohibit class-action lawsuits, do not allow contingency fees for lawyers who win cases and require losing parties to pay legal fees for both sides. Those policies often discourage lawyers and plaintiffs from filing lawsuits.\nBut Professor Coffee also cited a Supreme Court decision last month that could greatly reduce the ability of overseas factory workers and their families to file lawsuits in United States courts.\n\u201cIt may be that those retailers who worry about legal liability are pointing to an outdated sense of what liability is for actions taken abroad,\u201d Professor Coffee said. He added that if an accident occurred abroad \u2014 for instance, at a factory in Bangladesh \u2014 \u201cthere is an increasing doubt that the American retailer could be sued in the United States,\u201d because the Supreme Court ruling, Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum, went far to curb such lawsuits under the Alien Tort Claims Act.\nLong before the Bangladesh safety plan was developed, overseas workers had sued American retailers over illegally low wages, 12-hour shifts and the use of guard dogs and barbed wire fences, said Scott Nova, executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a university-backed factory monitoring group. In 2003, Gap, Nordstrom, Target, Wal-Mart and 20 other retailers settled a lawsuit for $20 million on behalf of 30,000 garment workers on the Pacific island of Saipan who alleged those abuses.\nMr. Lubbe cited a more recent lawsuit as evidence that American retailers still faced risks. Last year, the University of Wisconsin sued Adidas, demanding that it pay $1.8 million in severance benefits to former workers at an Indonesian factory it used. The factory\u2019s owner had failed to comply with an order to pay those benefits to 2,800 workers who lost their jobs.\nMr. Nova said the University of Wisconsin lawsuit was based on a licensing agreement with more specific obligations than the Bangladesh accord. Adidas had pledged to comply with a labor code of conduct that said it must \u201censure that all manufacturers comply\u201d with the code and \u201cprovide legally mandated benefits,\u201d such as severance benefits.\nUnder the international agreement, a great number of Bangladesh\u2019s more than 5,000 apparel factories could be affected. Some workplace experts estimate that fixing safety problems could cost at least $500,000 on average per factory, meaning that the countrywide price tag could easily exceed $1 billion over several years. Some note, however, that the expense would be just a fraction of the $18 billion worth of apparel exported annually by Bangladesh, the second-largest garment exporter after China.\nGap\u2019s spokesman, Bill Chandler, said the accord contained numerous provisions that worried American retailers. He said the plan\u2019s binding, contractual nature could impose large legal obligations that were hard to estimate because of the plan\u2019s ambiguities.\nFor instance, it does not detail how much the Bangladeshi apparel manufacturer should pay toward needed safety upgrades \u2014 perhaps factories lack a fire escape \u2014 and how much the Western companies that use those factories should pay. Another ambiguity is how costs for safety improvements will be apportioned among the several Western companies that buy garments from a given factory in Bangladesh.\n\u201cThe language is vague and unclear and thus there can be too much legal liability for our company in Bangladesh,\u201d Mr. Chandler said. Such statements cause some supporters of the plan to assert that American retailers\u2019 real objection is the price of financing safety improvements.\nPaul Lister, director of legal services at Associated British Foods, the parent of Primark, a retailer that has signed the Bangladesh accord, acknowledged that the plan has ambiguities. He said the signatories planned to work with government and labor officials over the next 45 days to decide on the details.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a perfect document,\u201d Mr. Lister said. \u201cWe\u2019ll deal with the imperfections in the document, and we have to deal urgently with the underlying issue \u2014 the moral and ethical issues of fire safety and building integrity in Bangladesh.\u201d\nSounding far different from American retailers, Anna Gedda, manager for social sustainability at H&M, the Swedish company that is the biggest buyer of apparel from Bangladesh, voiced little concern about legal liability.\n\u201cThe fact that it was a legally binding accord was not a big issue,\u201d she said. \u201cI know it is for American brands but it isn\u2019t for us.\u201d The accord contains a clause that calls for settling disputes through independent arbitrators in an effort to keep disputes out of court.\n\u201cThis whole fear of lawsuits is a straw man,\u201d said Philip J. Jennings, general secretary of Uni Global Union, a worldwide federation of 20 million retail and service workers, who has negotiated with various retailers to develop the plan and persuaded them to join it. \u201cIf these American retailers get 20 lawyers in a room, they start hyperventilating about lawsuits and they\u2019ll have a communal anxiety attack.\u201d\nMatthew Shay, president of the National Retail Federation, gave another reason for opposing the Bangladesh plan, saying it \u201cseeks to advance a narrow agenda driven by special interests,\u201d a reference to the labor unions that helped shape the plan and then pressed retailers to sign on.\nJyrki Raina, general secretary of IndustriALL, a union federation with 50 million members from 140 countries, said that European retailers were receptive because they often deal with and negotiate with labor unions.\nIn rejecting the accord, Wal-Mart outlined its own proposals that it said would meet or exceed the accord\u2019s goals. The company, the world\u2019s largest retailer, predicted quicker results, saying it would inspect all of the 279 factories it uses in Bangladesh over the next six months.\nWhile Wal-Mart, voicing concern about potential liability, said the plan \u201cintroduces requirements, including governance and dispute resolution mechanisms, on supply chain matters that are appropriately left to retailers, suppliers and government.\u201d\nRepresentative Sander Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, who has urged the Obama administration to do more to improve factory safety in Bangladesh, criticized Wal-Mart\u2019s approach. \u201cIt\u2019s been left up to the retailers, suppliers and government all these years, and that hasn\u2019t worked,\u201d he said.",

    "text": "As Firms Line Up on Factories, Wal-Mart Plans Solo Effort\n2013-05-14T17:58:18.000Z\nAs American retailers face mounting pressure to join a landmark plan to improve factory safety in Bangladesh, newly found documents indicate that apparel had been produced for Wal-Mart at one of the operations in the factory building that collapsed last month, killing more than 1,100 workers.\nThe Bangladesh Center for Worker Solidarity has provided The New York Times with photos of several documents not disputed by Wal-Mart that were recovered in the building\u2019s rubble, showing that a Wal-Mart contractor from Canada had produced jeans last year at the Ether Tex factory, which had been situated on the fifth floor of the collapsed Rana Plaza building. \nWhile both the contractor and Wal-Mart denied any knowledge of the production orders there, Wal-Mart on Tuesday announced that it would put in place new safety measures at the factories it was using in Bangladesh. \nSaying it was unwilling to sign on to the broad safety plan embraced by more than a dozen European companies this week, Wal-Mart said its factory monitors would \u201cconduct in-depth safety inspections at 100 percent\u201d of the 279 factories it uses in Bangladesh and publicize the results on its Web site. \nWal-Mart promised to stop production immediately at factories if urgent safety problems were uncovered and to notify factory owners and government authorities of improvements. But the company, the world\u2019s largest retailer, stopped short of committing to help underwrite the improvements \u2014 one of the crucial aspects of the Bangladesh safety agreement adopted by European companies. \nOn Tuesday, Carrefour, the world\u2019s second largest retailer, Benetton, Marks & Spencer and El Corte Ingl\u00e9s, the Spanish department store chain, joined major retailers like H&M and Inditex, the parent of Zara, in signing on to the safety agreement. The plan requires companies to have rigorous independent inspections and to help pay for fire safety upgrades, like adding fire escapes, which many factories still lack. \nBut Wal-Mart and numerous other American retailers and apparel companies have sought to maintain a distance from the April 24 building collapse, and have balked at the worker safety agreement urged by consumer and labor groups. \nWal-Mart maintained on Tuesday that it had no involvement at the Rana Plaza building, playing down the newly discovered documents. \nOne document, dated May 12, 2012, that was found in the rubble detailed a purchase order by a Canadian company, Fame Jeans, for \u201cdark blue wash,\u201d \u201cskinny fit\u201d jeans to be delivered to Wal-Mart in the fall of 2012. Another document, dated April 27, 2012, discussed pricing for five styles of jeans, with the prices ranging from $3.41 to $4.50 a pair.\nBut Wal-Mart emphasized that the documents dated back a year. \u201cOur investigation of the Rana Plaza building site after the collapse revealed no evidence of authorized or unauthorized production at the time of the tragedy,\u201d said Kevin Gardner, a Wal-Mart spokesman. He declined to say on Tuesday whether the Ether Tex factory, as well as the Fame Jeans order there, were authorized. \nAfter The Times questioned Wal-Mart about the documents on Tuesday, Alen Brandman, chief executive of Fame Jeans, said in an interview, \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that Wal-Mart did not authorize me in any capacity to work within this factory.\u201d He blamed a \u201crogue employee\u201d for the order, who had decided to use the factory without Mr. Brandman\u2019s knowledge.\nHe said after that order \u201cno other product came out\u201d of that factory \u201cfor us or for Wal-Mart.\u201d\nAfter a fire last November at another Bangladesh garment factory that killed 112 workers, numerous documents showed that six suppliers had clothes made there for Wal-Mart in previous months. Wal-Mart said it had deauthorized the factory because of violations and had terminated its relationship with the suppliers that continued using the factory after it was deauthorized. \nJudy Gearhart, executive director of the International Labor Rights Forum, an advocacy group in Washington, faulted Wal-Mart for again trying to distance itself from the building collapse just as it sought to do after the November fire. \u201cIt\u2019s another example of Wal-Mart\u2019s lack of ability to track the specifics of its supply chain,\u201d she said.\nAt the time of the building collapse, Wal-Mart was listed as a customer on Ether Tex\u2019s Web site, another link that advocacy groups were using to try to pressure the retailer, Gap, Target and other American companies to sign onto the safety plan. The only non-European companies to sign are PVH, the parent company of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Loblaw of Canada.\nBy far, Gap has been the most vocal company opposed to the plan, expressing concerns that overzealous American lawyers could seize on the agreement to sue American companies on behalf of aggrieved factory workers in Bangladesh \u2014 perhaps in the event of a factory fire. Gap said it supported much of the plan, but it proposed changes that would greatly limit any legal liability for a company that violated the plan. \nUnder Gap\u2019s proposal, if a retailer were found to have violated the agreement, the only remedy would generally be public expulsion from the factory safety plan. \n\u201cThe U.S. is quite litigious,\u201d said Bill Chandler, a Gap spokesman. \u201cWe put forward specific proposals that we thought would bring other American retailers into the fold. We thought it would be a step forward and would turn it into a much more global agreement.\u201d \nConsumer and labor groups said Gap\u2019s concerns about litigation were overblown. They complained that Gap\u2019s stance against the agreement had helped to dissuade other American companies from signing. \n\u201cGap\u2019s demand is that the agreement be made unenforceable \u2014 and therefore meaningless,\u201d said Scott Nova, executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a group sponsored by 175 colleges and universities. \u201cWhat Gap wants is the right to renege on its commitments when it wishes.\u201d \nSome advocates say the European retailers signed the joint accord more readily than the Americans because Europe accounts for 60 percent of Bangladesh apparel exports and the United States one-fourth.\nWal-Mart also expressed concerns about the joint Bangladesh safety plan, saying it \u201cintroduces requirements, including governance and dispute resolution mechanisms, on supply chain matters that are appropriately left to retailers, suppliers and government, and are unnecessary to achieve fire and safety goals.\u201d \nWal-Mart added that its plan either meets or \u201cexceeds\u201d the group safety plan, and would get quicker results. \nThe retailer said its factory inspectors would examine electrical systems for any flaws \u2014 a major cause of factory fires in Bangladesh \u2014 and would review building design and permits to help avoid future collapses. Those inspections would include thermal circuit imaging of factories\u2019 electrical systems to analyze for problems. \n\u201cWal-Mart is committed to a global supply chain that first and foremost provides safe conditions for workers,\u201d said Rajan Kamalanathan, vice president of ethical sourcing for Wal-Mart. \u201cWal-Mart is focusing directly on the most urgent issue, and that\u2019s worker safety. We invite others to join us in this effort.\u201d \nWal-Mart praised the Bangladeshi government for closing 18 factories that had safety violations. The company said that based on its information none of those factories were making authorized apparel for Wal-Mart, although three of those factories were owned by the Nassa Group, which claims Wal-Mart and Sears as customers and is Bangladesh\u2019s largest exporter. \nMr. Nova voiced skepticism that Wal-Mart\u2019s initiative would significantly improve worker safety. \u201cIt is a unilateral initiative that\u2019s nonbinding and unenforceable, and it\u2019s unclear how much transparency there will be,\u201d he said. \u201cIf all of this stuff happens, there\u2019s substance, but there\u2019s no basis to believe it will all happen.\u201d",

    "text": "Rooting for Mother Teresa\n2013-07-12T23:36:10.000Z\nPOPE FRANCIS last week approved two of his predecessors for sainthood \u2014 John Paul II and John XXIII \u2014 fast-tracking the latter in spite of his having only one miracle to his credit rather than the usual two. Mother Teresa, who died in 1997, has not been given the same exemption (she also has just one miracle) and remains merely beatified. \nHaving volunteered for a time with Mother Teresa, I find myself rooting for her cause as if for the home team. And on principle I\u2019m disappointed by the message sent when two men with complex legacies outpace a woman who devoted herself completely to serving others.\nTo many Roman Catholics, Mother Teresa, who was born Agnes Bojaxhiu in 1910 of Albanian heritage, was the religion\u2019s best ambassador. \u201cShe was one of the only things we learned about in Catholic school that I thought made total sense,\u201d a friend of mine recently told me.\nTwo years before Mother Teresa died, I saw her work firsthand. I was 18, traveling around the world alone for the better part of a year. After spending time in Bangladesh, I entered India via what was then Calcutta (now Kolkata), staying at a dollar-a-night dormitory called the Hotel Maria. I slept on the roof, and there met some Australians who were volunteering for Mother Teresa. One day I joined them.\nAt dawn, we walked past the city\u2019s countless beggars and dead puppies and kittens and arrived at Mother House, the headquarters of her order, the Missionaries of Charity. I was sent to the mission for the elderly. There I spent the day washing older people and their clothes and dishes. I helped feed them rice and tucked them into bed.\nIn the week that followed, I watched as members of the order drove a makeshift fleet of rickshaws around Calcutta\u2019s streets, returning with ever more people in acute states of distress and neglect, some of them hours from death. The facilities were almost aggressively rickety \u2014 there was a hole in the bucket the nuns used to pull water from the well \u2014 but they were as good or better than what was otherwise widely available (as I learned myself when some weeks later I wound up at a free clinic in another part of India suffering from amebic dysentery).\nOn my last night in Calcutta, Mother Teresa blessed me, gave me a Virgin Mary medallion and told me to come back someday. Even though I\u2019m not Catholic, I was moved by her total commitment to the work at hand, which amounted to diverting a flash flood of sorrow, suffering and need directly into her front door.\nHer case for sainthood has always seemed to me like a slam-dunk. (I know being made a saint is a mystical process, not a qualifying exam, but as its recent announcement suggests, if the Vatican wants someone sainted, it can make it happen.) I wonder if the Vatican has been affected by the critiques of her work. The most famous, of course, is Christopher Hitchens\u2019s 1995 book, \u201cThe Missionary Position.\u201d He criticized her for, among other things, not offering higher-quality medical care to those in her clinics, and for taking money from the likes of Charles H. Keating Jr., the tarnished financier, and the Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier.\nShe has also been subjected to online screeds calling her a hypocrite for going to a modern hospital when she herself was sick, and for flying first class. Hemley Gonzalez of Miami, a disillusioned former Missionaries of Charity volunteer, maintains a Facebook page called \u201cSTOP the Missionaries of Charity.\u201d He and others insist that for a woman so admired for helping the poor, she showed too little interest in the systemic causes of poverty, viewing it as something to embrace, not eliminate: \u201cI think it is very beautiful for the poor to accept their lot,\u201d she once said, \u201cto share it with the passion of Christ.\u201d\nAmong her many defenders is an amiable Canadian-born priest, the Rev. Brian Kolodiejchuk. He runs the Mother Teresa Center, collaborated with her on many projects and is her official \u201cpostulator.\u201d That means he\u2019s in charge of investigating claims that her intervention with God on behalf of someone praying to her resulted in an instantaneous, complete and enduring miracle \u2014 like a medical cure. The Vatican then must validate it for canonization to move forward. He\u2019s still looking.\nMeanwhile, I\u2019m left to wonder if it\u2019s something about Mother Teresa herself that has caused her bid for sainthood to stall. In a book of letters published posthumously, \u201cCome Be My Light,\u201d she wrote: \u201cJesus has a very special love for you. As for me, the silence and the emptiness is so great that I look and do not see, listen and do not hear.\u201d Some atheists gleefully latched onto those remarks as a confession of doubt. But that book endeared her even more to others, including me. The fact that she felt doubt but continued to do so much (even if it wasn\u2019t everything imaginable by Western standards) was inspiring to those of us who struggle to muster basic human kindness when we haven\u2019t had enough coffee.\nMaybe it\u2019s that admitted fallibility that\u2019s delaying her cause. Maybe she\u2019s too human to be a saint.",

    "text": "Celebrities With Their Hands Out\n2013-09-14T19:33:14.000Z\nSince 2009 the crowdfunding Web site Kickstarter has matched artists and entrepreneurs struggling to finance creative projects with people on the Internet willing to contribute a little cash. The earliest adopters of the technology, on the pitching side, were small-time musicians, unestablished filmmakers and others with no clear access to capital.\nGradually, however, more prominent types have discovered the site. In March, Rob Thomas, creator of the TV series \u201cVeronica Mars,\u201d and Kristen Bell, the star of the show, used Kickstarter to finance \u201cVeronica Mars\u201d the movie. They set a target of $2 million and ultimately brought in $5.7 million from more than 90,000 donors. In April, the actor-director Zach Braff raised $3.1 million for a follow-up to his 2004 directorial debut, \u201cGarden State.\u201d\nOver the summer Spike Lee, the two-time Academy Award nominee, took in $1.4 million for an untitled film about \u201chuman beings who are addicted to blood.\u201d And two weeks ago Maria Pinto, who designed a dress Michelle Obama wore at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, launched a Kickstarter campaign with a goal of reaching $250,000 for a new line of women\u2019s clothing.\nKickstarter, once the domain of unknowns seeking their first big break, is now also a resource for big names intrigued by the potential of micropatronage. Not surprisingly, this cultural shift has spurred howls of protest, with critical essays on celebrity \u201cpanhandling\u201d washing over the media.\nThere are two main arguments against the celebrity invasion. First is that it\u2019s in poor taste for the rich-and-famous to solicit money from the public when they presumably have access to more traditional financing or might even be able to self-finance projects. The second is that, like affluent professionals descending on a cheap, hip neighborhood, celebrities are making Kickstarter less hospitable to aspiring artists. In May, the director Kevin Smith said he would never \u201csuck any loot out of the crowdfunding marketplace that might otherwise go to a first-timer who can really use it.\u201d\nThe aversion to deep-pocketed stars on Kickstarter is understandable. But a big name does not guarantee access to financing for creative projects. Even established artists may struggle to attract investment \u2014 a point Mr. Lee made about his own experience in defending his decision to try crowdfunding. Besides, anyone who feels uncomfortable is under no obligation to give.\nAnd contrary to what some believe, Kickstarter is not a zero-sum game. Instead of vacuuming up finite resources, celebrity campaigns seem to widen the donor pool. Forty-seven percent of Mr. Lee\u2019s backers had never before contributed on Kickstarter. Once drawn in by a celebrity, donors may patronize lesser-known artists. As the Kickstarter founders wrote on their blog in August, the \u201cVeronica Mars\u201d and Zach Braff bids \u201cbrought thousands of new people to Kickstarter who have since pledged more than $1 million to 6,000 other projects.\u201d\nThe gentrification of Kickstarter doesn\u2019t seem to be hurting its original inhabitants. It may even be helping them.",

    "text": "Looser Rules on Illegal Housing Sought\n2013-10-14T00:55:19.000Z\nRakha and Mahbub Sarkar spent more than $4,000 upgrading the cellar apartment of their Queens home. They put in new floors and kitchen cabinets, and in the borough\u2019s tight market for rentals under $1,000 a month, they had no problem finding new tenants. \nBut not long after the remodeling, city building inspectors swooped in. They made the tenants move out, they ordered the Sarkars to dismantle the rental unit and they imposed an initial penalty of $1,200. \nThe couple\u2019s offense: an illegal conversion. \nThe Sarkars are still removing debris after taking down the kitchen and the wall that used to divide the studio-size space. \u201cI had to wreck everything,\u201d said Ms. Sarkar, 34, a stay-at-home mother who lives with her husband, a limousine driver, and their two children in the two-story home in Richmond Hill. \nNew York City\u2019s Department of Buildings issues more than 4,400 violations a year for illegally converted basements, cellars and attics that cannot be occupied because of health and safety hazards, like poor ventilation or a lack of multiple exits.\nBut with the scarcity of affordable housing in the city and with many New Yorkers already living in makeshift apartments, some housing advocates are calling for a new approach. They want the city to legalize at least some of these units by waiving certain laws, as the Bloomberg administration did last year to test so-called micro-units. Smaller than the current 450-square-foot minimum for studios, such micro-units are planned for a Manhattan building scheduled to open in 2015 in a pilot project.\n\u201cMicro-units are the high-end version of the basement units,\u201d said City Councilman Brad Lander, who said he was drafting legislation to create a new category for \u201caccessory\u201d dwelling units and specific zoning and building code standards for them. \u201cThere are a lot of units that are perfectly safe that can\u2019t be made legal under current rules.\u201d\nThe push for more flexibility is coming from elected officials, community groups and building industry professionals who say unauthorized units continue to flourish despite enforcement crackdowns because they meet pressing needs: they house lower-income tenants, they help homeowners pay mortgages and they accommodate some of the city\u2019s growing population.\nRelaxing the rules, though, can be a tough sell among neighbors who see illegal units as a drain on schools, hospitals, parking and other resources.\nThis year, legalization has made it onto the advocacy agenda of housing groups and the platform of the Democratic mayoral nominee, Bill de Blasio, who has singled out illegal basements and \u201cgranny flats\u201d as possible additions to the city\u2019s rent-regulated housing stock. Mr. de Blasio lived in a basement apartment in Astoria, Queens, in the 1980s but \u201ccan\u2019t say for sure\u201d whether it was legal, his campaign spokesman, Dan Levitan, said.\nLargely written to prevent slum conditions and firetraps, New York\u2019s housing regulations have not kept up with changing cultural norms and increasing financial pressures, some housing experts said. It is, for example, illegal for more than three unrelated adults to live together in New York City. That law is widely broken and infrequently enforced.\nFor many students and new immigrants, sharing space has long been the most affordable housing option in the city. New economic challenges, the experts said, have spurred even more demand for such arrangements. \n\u201cThere are ways we can allow people to live in different kinds of configurations that would be cheaper for them,\u201d said Ingrid Gould Ellen, a co-director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University.\nA 2008 study by two nonprofit groups \u2014 the Pratt Center for Community Development and the Chhaya Community Development Corporation \u2014 found the city\u2019s illegal \u201caccessory\u201d units to be concentrated in immigrant neighborhoods of Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx, where they rented for as little as one-third below market rates. That study estimated the size of \u201cthe housing underground\u201d \u2014 illegal basements, rooming houses, commercial lofts and other such dwellings \u2014 at more than 114,000 units.\nAdvocates of legalizing some of these units \u2014 the ones that are safe or can be made safe by adding doors and windows and are not prone to flooding \u2014 are now focusing on those that could easily come into compliance if laws were more flexible or conversion rules and costs more manageable. \nAdditional housing stock could be created, for instance, by allowing conversions of cellars, which currently can never be rented or occupied. (Under the city\u2019s regulations, the lowest level of a structure is a cellar if more than half the height is below curb level; if at least half of its height is above curb level, then it is considered a basement.)\nFor a couple from Bangladesh living in Queens, the legal status of their cellar rental in Hollis is of great consequence, said the wife, speaking on the condition of anonymity so as not to draw the attention of the authorities. A 30-year-old bank teller, she said they pay $750 a month, including utilities and Internet, for the space, which allows them to save for a full-fledged apartment. But because they have no lease, her husband, a software engineer who is applying for citizenship, has no proof of residency.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any legal anything,\u201d she said. \nUnlike cellars, basements in homes can be rented out when zoning permits, as long as they have a second way out and meet minimum requirements for air, light and sanitation, city officials said. But such conversions can cost around $15,000, and securing the necessary permits can take a long time, said Seema Agnani, the executive director of Chhaya. \nThe group is lobbying city officials for a pilot program to test conversions of both cellars and basements. That would include financial incentives, like low-cost loans; a property tax abatement; and free engineering assistance to examine and improve conditions. It also seeks to have the units designated as rent-regulated to maintain them affordable.\nBuildings Department officials said they received 18,126 complaints about illegal units last year, and the Queens borough president, Helen M. Marshall, said she had not heard a lot of support for the legalization effort. \n\u201cWhat we do hear is complaints about excessive number of residents in illegal and unsafe dwellings, multiple electrical boxes that indicate the structure is not being used legally, excessive garbage buildup and the danger of fire,\u201d Ms. Marshall said.\nBut advocates of legalization say the point is to deal with an existing problem and allow better city planning. \u201cWe want a path to legalization,\u201d said Jerilyn Perine, executive director of the research group Citizens Housing and Planning Council and a former city housing commissioner. \u201cNot every unit should be legalized, but there are some that could.\u201d\nFor owners and tenants, the advantage is not having their lives upended.\nThe Sarkars bought their house eight years ago with tenants already in the cellar, and initially they thought the setup was legal. But after raiding the home, the Buildings Department told the couple their cellar was approved only for the boiler, storage or a recreation room.\nNow, the Sarkars are struggling without the $800 a month they formerly took in from tenants, the husband, Mahbub Sarkar, said.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get the rent, we can\u2019t pay the mortgage,\u201d he said. The couple has pondered selling the house, Ms. Sarkar said, \u201cbut we put everything new in this house.\u201d\n\u201cWe spent a lot of time talking about how to fix this house,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we were to leave, it\u2019d be really heartbreaking.\u201d",

    "text": "Nixon and Kissinger\u2019s Forgotten Shame\n2013-09-30T01:05:57.000Z\nPRINCETON, N.J. \u2014 BANGLADESH is in fresh turmoil. On Sept. 17, its Supreme Court decided that Abdul Quader Mollah, a leading Islamist politician, should be hanged for war crimes committed during the country\u2019s 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. When he was given a life sentence by a Bangladeshi war-crimes tribunal back in February, tens of thousands of Bangladeshis took to the streets demanding his execution. Since then, more than a hundred people have died in protests and counterprotests. \nThis may sound remote or irrelevant to Americans, but the unrest has much to do with the United States. Some of Bangladesh\u2019s current problems stem from its traumatic birth in 1971 \u2014 when President Richard M. Nixon and Henry A. Kissinger, his national security adviser, vigorously supported the killers and tormentors of a generation of Bangladeshis.\nFrom the partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947, Pakistan was created as a unified Muslim nation with a bizarrely divided geography: dominant West Pakistan (now simply Pakistan) was separated from downtrodden East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) by a thousand miles of hostile India. Pakistanis joked that their bifurcated country was united by Islam and Pakistan International Airlines. This strange arrangement held until 1970, when Bengali nationalists in East Pakistan triumphed in nationwide elections. The ruling military government, based in West Pakistan, feared losing its grip.\nSo on March 25, 1971, the Pakistani Army launched a devastating crackdown on the rebellious Bengalis in the east. Midway through the bloodshed, both the C.I.A. and the State Department conservatively estimated that about 200,000 people had died (the Bangladeshi government figure is much higher, at three million). As many as 10 million Bengali refugees fled across the border into India, where they died in droves in wretched refugee camps.\nAs recently declassified documents and White House tapes show, Nixon and Kissinger stood stoutly behind Pakistan\u2019s generals, supporting the murderous regime at many of the most crucial moments. This largely overlooked horror ranks among the darkest chapters in the entire cold war. \nOf course, no country, not even the United States, can prevent massacres everywhere in the world \u2014 but this was a close American ally, which prized its warm relationship with the United States and used American weapons and military supplies against its own people. \nNixon and Kissinger barely tried to exert leverage over Pakistan\u2019s military government. In the pivotal days before the crackdown began on March 25, they consciously decided not to warn the Pakistani generals against opening fire on their population. They did not press for respecting the election results, nor did they prod the military to cut a power-sharing deal with the Bengali leadership. They did not offer warnings or impose conditions that might have dissuaded the Pakistani junta from atrocities. Nor did they threaten the loss of American military or economic support after the slaughter began.\nNixon and Kissinger were not just motivated by dispassionate realpolitik, weighing Pakistan\u2019s help with the secret opening to China or India\u2019s pro-Soviet leanings. The White House tapes capture their emotional rage, going far beyond Nixon\u2019s habitual vulgarity. In the Oval Office, Nixon told Kissinger that the Indians needed \u201ca mass famine.\u201d Kissinger sneered at people who \u201cbleed\u201d for \u201cthe dying Bengalis.\u201d\nThey were unmoved by the suffering of Bengalis, despite detailed reporting about the killing from Archer K. Blood, the brave United States consul general in East Pakistan. Nor did Nixon and Kissinger waver when Kenneth B. Keating, a former Republican senator from New York then serving as the American ambassador to India, personally confronted them in the Oval Office about \u201ca matter of genocide\u201d that targeted the Hindu minority among the Bengalis. \nAfter Mr. Blood\u2019s consulate sent an extraordinary cable formally dissenting from American policy, decrying what it called genocide, Nixon and Kissinger ousted Mr. Blood from his post in East Pakistan. Kissinger privately scorned Mr. Blood as \u201cthis maniac\u201d; Nixon called Mr. Keating \u201ca traitor.\u201d\nIndia was secretly sponsoring a Bengali insurgency in East Pakistan, and the violence ended only after India and Pakistan went to war in December 1971, with the Indian Army swiftly securing an independent Bangladesh. Economic development and political progress were always going to be difficult there. But Bangladesh\u2019s situation was made tougher by the devastation: lost lives, wrecked infrastructure and radicalized politics.\nBangladesh, despite its recent economic growth, is a haunted country. Part of the tumult centers on the fate of defendants like Abdul Quader Mollah, who face judgment in a series of national war crimes trials for atrocities committed in 1971 by local collaborators with West Pakistan. These trials are popular, but the court has often failed to meet fair standards of due process. Its proceedings have ensnared members of the largest Islamist political party, Jamaat-e-Islami, which is aligned with the main political rival of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. \nIt will be up to Bangladeshis to fix their country\u2019s rancorous politics, but their task was made harder from the outset by Nixon and Kissinger\u2019s callousness. The legacy of 1971 still stains the reputation of the United States in India as well. If an apology from Kissinger is too much to expect, Americans ought at least to remember what he and Nixon did in those terrible days.",

    "text": "A 40-Year Quest for Justice\n2013-03-01T02:16:31.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh\nFOR the past month, tens of thousands of Bangladeshis have filled Shahbagh Square here, demanding justice for crimes committed in 1971, when Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan) attained its independence from Pakistan.\nOrdinary people \u2014 grandparents, people in wheelchairs, men with beards, women in hijab, teenagers in jeans \u2014 have come out in throngs, in anger, but also in joy. Children are decked out in their favorite clothes, sitting on the shoulders of parents chanting slogans they don\u2019t understand. Women have been able to participate safely, free from the harassment that often accompanies large crowds of angry men. \nThe year 1971 was seminal for Bangladesh. We had been denied our right to self-rule since the Indian subcontinent was partitioned in 1947. In March of \u201971, the Pakistani military, supported by China and the United States, initiated a bloody suppression of 75 million Bangladeshis. Millions fled the murderous onslaught and sought refuge in India. \nMilitias affiliated with the Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami collaborated with the Pakistani military. They informed on, hunted out, and participated in the rape, killing and torture of ordinary citizens. They targeted hundreds of intellectuals, who were killed in cold blood.\nAfter Bangladesh achieved independence, with help from India, in December 1971, the new government promised to punish the razakars, or collaborators. \nWe all knew who they were. But realpolitik in a young nation surrounded by powerful neighbors inevitably led to compromises. Bangladesh\u2019s founding leader, Sheik Mujibur Rahman, set up special tribunals to try the collaborators. Several thousand cases were filed, but the quest for justice was derailed in late 1973 when Sheik Mujibur declared a general amnesty for the collaborators against whom trials had not yet been initiated. Two years later, he was assassinated, and a series of military coups followed. \nBangladesh\u2019s original Constitution had four basic principles: nationalism, democracy, socialism and secularism. Military dictators replaced that with \u201cabsolute trust and faith in the Almighty Allah as the basis of all actions\u201d in 1977, and made another change in 1988 that led to our once-secular nation\u2019s being redefined as an Islamist one. Martial law, amnesty and political deals allowed the collaborators to go free and Jamaat-e-Islami to gradually rejoin the political mainstream.\n\n6 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nOnly in 2010 was a tribunal at last established to investigate the 1971 war crimes. It delivered its first verdict last month, sentencing a former Jamaat member, Abul Kalam Azad, to death. In a second decision, on Feb. 5, it sentenced a top current Jamaat leader, Abdul Quader Mollah, to life in prison \u2014 a sentence the protesters regard as far too lenient. \nThe demonstrators suspect that the life sentence is part of a secret deal the current prime minister, Sheikh Hasina Wazed (a daughter of the nation\u2019s assassinated founder) has made with Islamist leaders to preserve her power. \nJamaat belongs to an opposition coalition led by the Bangladesh National Party. There is widespread fear that if a new government comes to power in approaching parliamentary elections, it will pardon Mr. Mollah, Mr. Azad and other Jamaat members still facing trial \u2014 allowing the collaborators of 1971 go free once again. The current government has set a dangerous precedent: Since 2009, Ms. Hasina has pardoned some 20 death-row convicts, including hardened criminals charged with grisly murders. \nMost of the young protesters in Shahbagh Square never lived under occupation or experienced the terror of midnight raids or the fear of rape, torture and wanton killing. But they are furious over government duplicity. \nYears of kleptocratic rule, nepotism, corruption and abuse of power have eroded trust in government in Bangladesh. People feel that the system is so corrupt that change cannot possibly emerge in the electoral arena. That\u2019s why hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshis have gathered in the past month in a spontaneous movement that quickly spread across the country.\nOn Feb. 15, Ahmed Rajib Haider, a blogger and one of the organizers of the protest movement, was murdered. His throat was slit, his body mutilated \u2014 trademarks of Jamaat\u2019s student wing. The protests swelled with anger and grief, but Shahbagh did not erupt into a frenzy of revenge. There were those who felt we were being na\u00efve, that an eye for an eye was the only answer. But this was a gentle crowd \u2014 prepared to resist, but not to imitate. \nSince then, there has been more violence. On Thursday, the protesters in Shahbagh rejoiced after the tribunal announced a death sentence for another Jamaat leader, Delawar Hossain Sayedee. Jamaat members have retaliated violently, leading to bloody clashes across the country. \nYoung kids baying for blood will make many justifiably uncomfortable. And no court should be forced to alter a verdict because of popular pressure.\nBut the protests in Shahbagh must be seen as more than a demand for blanket death sentences. They are also a democratic outcry, demanding that justice finally be done \u2014 and an attempt by a nation to wrest control from failed leaders who have consistently put personal profit over national interest. The protests represent the spirit of 1971 \u2014 and a bigger war that is yet to be won. ",

    "text": "Link to African Ebola Found in Bats Suggests Virus Is More Widespread\n2013-01-28T22:24:45.000Z\nFor the first time, scientists have found evidence of the African Ebola virus in Asian fruit bats, suggesting that the virus is far more widespread around the world than had been previously known.\nThat does not mean that outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever are inevitable, said Kevin J. Olival, leader of the bat-hunting team at EcoHealth Alliance. But the possibility exists: bats are believed to drink out of jars attached to trees to collect tasty date palm sap, and fatal outbreaks in Bangladesh of Nipah virus, which is not related to Ebola, have been blamed on fresh sap contaminated with bat saliva, urine or feces.\nPalm sap gatherers should be encouraged to put bamboo covers on their collecting jars to keep bats out, Dr. Olival said.\nFor the study, published this month in Emerging Infectious Diseases, his team caught 276 bats in four Bangladesh districts.\n\u201cThese bats roost in caves, but there are very few caves in Bangladesh, so we put up mist nets outside old ruins that looked like something out of \u2018Indiana Jones,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cIn the evenings, they would come out to forage.\u201d The team would untangle the bats, draw blood and take saliva, urine and fecal samples, and release them.\nFive of them \u2014 all from the Rousettus leschenaultia species \u2014 reacted to tests for antibodies to Zaire Ebola virus. The researchers did not find any virus itself, so it was not possible to do genetic sequencing and see exactly how close the match to the African strain was.\nAlthough closely related species of fruit bats are found in Africa, India and China, their territories do not overlap and these bats don\u2019t migrate long distances, Dr. Olival said, so it was likely the virus had been in a bat ancestor species for millenniums. A related virus, Ebola Reston, which is not known to sicken humans, has been found in Philippines fruit bats, and an \u201cEbola-like\u201d virus has been found in insect-eating bats in Spain. But the match in Bangladesh was closest to Zaire Ebola.\nEbola was at first thought to be a gorilla virus, because human outbreaks began after people ate the bodies of dead gorillas. But scientists believe that bats are the natural reservoir and that primates may get infected by eating fruit that bats have drooled or defecated on. ",

    "text": "Counting the Cost of Fixing the Future\n2013-09-11T01:27:46.000Z\nWhat would you pay to protect the world in which your great-great-grandchildren will live from hurricanes, drought and the like?\nIn May, to little fanfare, the Obama administration published new estimates of the \u201csocial cost of carbon,\u201d a dollars-and-cents measure of the future damage \u2014 from floods, pandemics, depressed agricultural productivity \u2014 that releasing each additional ton of heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere would cost.\nThe new numbers are likely to be more important than the low-key announcement would imply. They suggest climate change could cause substantially more economic harm than the government previously believed. But they also suggest there is a legitimate debate to be had about the cost of preventing it from getting worse.\nPerhaps the most startling conclusion to be drawn from the new estimates is that the sacrifice demanded of our generation to prevent vast climate change down the road may turn out to be rather small.\nThe typical passenger car emits a ton of CO2 in about two and a half months of driving. Under one set of assumptions, the government\u2019s number-crunchers determined that the damage caused by an additional ton of CO2 spewed into the air in 2015 would amount to $65 in today\u2019s money. That\u2019s 50 percent more than was estimated just three years ago.\nThis could justify fairly aggressive policies to slow emissions of CO2. A tax of $65 per ton of CO2 to force polluters to pay for the damage would add $0.56 to a gallon of gas. Exxon, say, might have to shell out $8.1 billion to cover the 125 million tons of CO2 it spewed last year. Farms might have to pay $35 billion. \nUnder a different set of assumptions, though, the social cost of carbon came out to only $13.50 a ton. This would amount to a gas tax of less than $0.12. Considering the fierce debate over what to do about climate change, this does not seem like that much money at all.\nInterestingly, the main source of the vast discrepancy between the two figures is not a disagreement about the future damages of warming.\nA 2009 review of the dozen or so existing estimates, by Richard Tol, professor of the economics of climate change at Vrije University in Amsterdam, found that studies using very different methodologies still roughly agreed on the magnitude of the impact.\nMost cost estimates clustered between 1 and 2 percent of the world\u2019s gross domestic product (estimated at about $85 trillion today), if temperatures were to increase 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit) above the preindustrial era. A more recent estimate by William D. Nordhaus of Yale, the foremost American economist studying climate change, concluded that allowing uncontrolled carbon emissions would raise temperatures above the preindustrial era by 3.4 degrees Celsius (6.1 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century and cost the world 2.8 percent of G.D.P. in 2095.\nIf damages were higher than expected, the government said the social cost of carbon could rise sharply \u2014 to a whopping $123 per ton of CO2.\nThe discrepancy between the estimates of the value of climate damage stem from radically different views on how much weight the people of the present should give to damages caused by the climate in the distant future.\nThe estimate of $65 a ton is inspired by a moral stance: if warming will impose a cost of 1 percent of the world\u2019s income in the future, we should spend about 1 percent of our income to prevent it \u2014 or perhaps somewhat less to account for the trend that people 100 years from now are likely to be much richer than people today.\nBy contrast, $13.50 a ton comes from the business world. Essentially, it requires that spending to prevent climate change should yield at least the same rate of return, in terms of reduced damages from warming, as any other capital investment.\nThe two outlooks lead to entirely different decisions. The government\u2019s rendition of the moral approach implies that it is worth making every investment to reduce carbon emissions that has a rate of return of at least 2.5 percent, in terms of avoided damages. Businesss logic suggests that no investment should be made if the return \u2014 after taxes \u2014 is less than 5 percent.\nThe moralist would try to keep the atmosphere from warming more than 2 degrees above its temperature in the preindustrial era, the agreed-upon target at the United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen four years ago. The executive would not, noting that aiming for this goal would cost trillions more than it saved.\nThink of it this way: Demanding a 5 percent return means that a dollar invested today should become at least $1.05 next year after inflation, and a little more than $1.10 the year after that. In 200 years it should be worth at least $17,292.58. Turn the logic around and we should spend $1 today to prevent climate-related damage only if it prevents damages of at least $17,292.58 two centuries down the road.\nThe moralist\u2019s bar is much lower. At 2.5 percent, spending $1 today would be justified if it prevented merely $139.56 worth of damage in 200 years.\nThe debate over climate change has none of this subtlety. Senate Republicans railed against the new numbers in June, taking the opportunity to signal their skepticism about the \u201cclaims of catastrophic global warming.\u201d\nThe United States Chamber of Commerce threw its weight behind  an amendment to an energy bill that passed the Republican-controlled House barring the Environmental Protection Agency from using the numbers in cost-benefit analyses to justify new regulations.\nBut for all the fury of the response, the new estimates from the Obama administration suggest that the burden American citizens and businesses will be called on to shoulder is likely to be modest \u2014 because business logic is likely to prevail.\nMultiple challenges compete for the world\u2019s resources, from economic development and ending poverty to eradicating AIDS and malaria. The climate is not the world\u2019s only priority. Even if we were to agree that improving the well-being of future generations is worth an enormous investment, there might be better things to invest in than reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nMost of Bangladesh is less than 33 feet above sea level. Millions of poor farmers on its alluvial plains would welcome investments to prevent melting polar ice caps and rising sea levels. But many would also welcome investments that made them richer and better able to cope with climate change, including jobs outside of agriculture and homes somewhere dry.\nAs Professor Nordhaus wrote in his 2008 book, \u201cA Question of Balance\u201d: \u201cInvestments in reducing future climate damages to corn and trees and other areas should compete with investments in better seed, improved rotation and many other high-yield investments.\u201d If investments in CO2 abatement are not competitive, we would do better by investing elsewhere and using the proceeds to cover warming\u2019s damage. We would still have money left over.\nProfessor Nordhaus says he prefers a 4 percent discount rate. Using it in \u201cA Question of Balance,\u201d he calculates that the optimal carbon tax comes in at around $11 per ton of CO2 in 2010, which is exactly the low end of the administration\u2019s estimate of the social cost of carbon.\nUsing it wouldn\u2019t cure the planet. By the year 2100, according to his model, the earth\u2019s temperature rises to 3.45 degrees Celsius above its level in the year 1900, and climate-related damages amount to some $17 trillion. Still, compared with doing nothing it would yield a $3 trillion return. That, he says, is the best we can do.\nBut the most compelling argument that business logic will prevail has little to do with its merits. It\u2019s simply that the world\u2019s decision-makers are following it. Four years after committing to a 2-degree ceiling, the world\u2019s current policies will lead us, by the end of the century, to blow past 3.",

    "text": "Retailers Are Pressed on Safety at Factories\n2013-05-11T01:10:20.000Z\nA wide spectrum of government officials, investors and religious groups are warning major retailers like Walmart, Benetton and Gap that they could face financial repercussions from consumers, damage to their stock value or sustained public protests if they do not adopt stricter garment manufacturing standards.\nWith the death toll rising above 1,000 two weeks after an eight-story factory building collapsed in Bangladesh, organizations and officials say they have been growing impatient with American and European retailers and apparel brands because only two companies \u2014 PVH, the parent company of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger; and Tchibo, a German retailer \u2014 have signed onto a binding agreement on safety standards for factories. That agreement would commit companies to allow independent inspections of the apparel factories they use, to terminate business at factories that do not quickly correct violations and to underwrite needed safety improvements. For example, many garment factories in Bangladesh lack basic means for workers to flee in case of fire \u2014 specifically fire escapes and smokeproof enclosed staircases. \nAvaaz, a human rights group, has collected 875,000 signatures on a petition urging Gap and H&M to sign on to the plan to commit to fire safety improvements at Bangladesh factories. New York City\u2019s comptroller, John C. Liu, who oversees city pension funds owning more than five million Walmart shares, is warning the company that it risks damage to its public image unless it does more on factory safety in Bangladesh. \nAnd the Rev. Seamus P. Finn, representing shareholders from the Catholic organization Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, has been circulating a letter among religious organizations \u2014 groups that control more than $100 billion in assets \u2014 to express displeasure with the nation\u2019s retailers. He says the retailers have not done nearly enough to improve workplace safety for the more than three million garment workers in Bangladesh.\n\u201cWhat happened in Bangladesh is a game-changer because of the gravity of the situation and the tremendous loss of life,\u201d Father Finn said. \u201cPeople are really coming to life about this and saying, \u2018We need to do something.\u2019\u00a0\u201d \nNot just Western retailers are encountering more pressure after the April 24 collapse of the Rana Plaza building outside Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital. The nation\u2019s government \u2014 known for lax building code enforcement \u2014 has suddenly grown tougher, closing 18 factories for safety violations. Three of those factories were run by the Nassa Group, the country\u2019s largest clothing exporter, which counts Walmart and Sears among its customers. Last weekend, the government also announced it would hire hundreds of additional factory inspectors. \nThe United States government has also been pressing Bangladesh and the apparel manufacturers there over safety. In January \u2014 two months after the Tazreen factory fire in Bangladesh killed 112 workers \u2014 the United States trade representative notified Bangladesh that Washington might withdraw, suspend or limit that country\u2019s trading privileges. The trade representative was responding in part to a complaint that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. filed, asserting that the Bangladesh government had worked in concert with its apparel manufacturers to suppress labor unions.\n\u201cThere are serious concerns in Bangladesh related to freedom of association, worker safety and other issues,\u201d a senior official in the trade representative\u2019s office said on Friday. The trade representative\u2019s office says it will decide in June whether to take action against Bangladesh, although under esoteric trade rules, any penalties could not be directed against that country\u2019s apparel industry.\nThe most visible pressures that retailers have faced are street protests, including one in Barcelona, where demonstrators wore shirts with fake blood stains to protest Mango, Benetton and other retailers. In the United States, university chapters of United Students Against Sweatshops have helped organize a series of demonstrations this week against Gap in Boston, Los Angeles, New York and Washington to press it on factory safety.\nAlex Wilks, campaign director of Avaaz, which has 21 million members worldwide, said its online petition was aimed at the chief executives of Gap and H&M. The petition says, \u201cYour companies and other multinationals profit from cheap labor, and can do much more to reduce the dangers of the places where your products are made.\u201d Bangladesh, the world\u2019s second-largest apparel exporter after China, has the lowest minimum wage in the world \u2014 $37 a month \u2014 which has helped it attract billions of dollars in orders from the West.\n\u201cWe feel that H&M and Gap are well placed to turn what have become death traps into safe factories,\u201d Mr. Wilks said. \u201cWe\u2019re targeting these two companies because they\u2019ve made commitments to ethics, and we feel that this leadership makes them well placed to not only lead their own companies but also to lead the rest of the industry to sign up to these strong and enforceable agreements.\u201d\nTwo weeks ago, the German government sponsored a conference of retailers, apparel brands and antisweatshop groups that sought to push the companies to agree to take strong safety measures in Bangladesh. The antisweatshop groups have set Wednesday, May 15, as a deadline to persuade retailers to join the PVH-Tchibo plan, and they say that any retailers that do not sign will be the target of new protests.\nSaying that his company has a strong reputation on social responsibility, Bill Chandler, a Gap spokesman, insisted that the attacks against his company were misplaced. \u201cIt\u2019s perplexing that they\u2019re targeting us when we\u2019re a leader in taking action on the ground while many others are passively sitting on the sidelines,\u201d he said.\nGap has hired a respected fire safety expert to inspect the dozens of factories it uses in Bangladesh. Gap has also said it will spend $22 million for fire safety improvement there. \nH&M, in a statement, said that improving fire and building safety in Bangladesh was one of its priorities. \u201cWe are working at full speed to reach the best solution with other stakeholders,\u201d the company said.\nMr. Liu has been singling out Walmart in particular. \u201cThe tragedy in Bangladesh may finally bring home the lesson to Walmart and others that they are responsible for their suppliers,\u201d he said. Walmart, Gap and H&M did not use any of the five factories in the building that collapsed, but customs records show that two American companies \u2014 the Children\u2019s Place and Cato Fashions \u2014 bought significant amounts of apparel from factories there over the last year. \nJane Singer, a Children\u2019s Place spokeswoman, said the company was evaluating the PVH-Tchibo proposal. \u201cWe have not reached any decisions at this point, but are committed to supporting changes to improve safety and working conditions,\u201d she said.\nKevin Gardner, a Walmart spokesman, said the retailer was working to develop strong standards from its suppliers to create \u201ca truly innovative, ethical and sustainable supply chain.\u201d \nThe union-owned Amalgamated Bank and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility are circulating letters among shareholders to exert pressure on numerous retailers. \nFather Finn noted that Gap and other companies had adopted their own programs for Bangladesh. \u201cEvery company wants its own code of conduct and enforcement mechanism,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re sure their way of doing things is better than their competitors\u2019. But we believe we need a comprehensive plan that includes many companies.\u201d\nKellie A. McElhaney, an expert on corporate social responsibility at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, predicted that these pressures would hardly sway the companies. \u201cThey are feeling a lot of pressure, but it\u2019s not coming from consumers. It\u2019s coming from N.G.O.\u2019s,\u201d she said, referring to nongovernment organizations. \u201cThey\u2019re not feeling it in the marketplace. I believe they\u2019re going to do the bare minimum. The N.G.O.\u2019s need to make more consumers aware of this.\u201d",

    "text": "Gene Sleuths Find How Some Naturally Resist Cholera\n2013-07-03T18:04:12.000Z\nPeople living in the Ganges Delta, where cholera is an ancient, endemic and often lethal disease, have adapted genetically to the scourge through variations in about 300 genes, say researchers who have scanned their genomes for the fingerprints of evolution.\nThe researchers also found unexpected changes in genes that protect against arsenic, suggesting that arsenic exposure in Bangladesh is not just a modern problem associated with deep tube wells but may have ancient roots.\nThese instances of natural selection probably took place within the last 5,000 to 30,000 years, the researchers say, and show how evolution has continued to mold human populations through the relatively recent past.\nPinpointing the genes responsible for natural resistance to cholera will help the development of better vaccines, said Dr. Regina C. LaRocque, an infectious disease expert at the Massachusetts General Hospital and an author of the study, published Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine. Vaccines now in use do not stay effective for long and must constantly be readministered in regions where the disease is endemic.\nThe genes that showed fingerprints of natural selection were identified by two other authors of the study, Elinor K. Karlsson and Dr. Pardis C. Sabeti, computational biologists at Harvard, in the genomes of Bengalis, the majority population in Bangladesh.\nThe selected genes offer a road map to how the body defends itself against cholera. Toxin from the bacterium binds to cells in the victim\u2019s intestine, prizing open the channels through which chloride ions leave the cell and forcing the cells to excrete volumes of water and electrolytes \u2014 up to two liters an hour. The diarrhea benefits the organism, which can reach drinking water and spread further, but can be lethal for the host if unchecked.\nOne set of selected genes in the Bengalis affects control of the innate immune system, the body\u2019s first line of defense against microbes. Another set of genes affects the channels that control the flow of potassium ions in and out of cells. It is not yet known exactly how the variations in any of the selected genes affect the biology of resisting cholera. But variations in the potassium channel genes, for instance, could help reverse the outward flow of water caused by the cholera toxin\u2019s attack on the chloride channels.\nThese findings fit the expected biology of cholera but upset other predictions. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a mutation in a gene that controls the movement of chloride in and out of cells. Since the cholera toxin requires this gene to be in working order, the mutation might be protective against it. But the researchers found no evidence of selection on the cystic fibrosis gene in the Bengali population.\nPeople with blood group O are particularly susceptible to cholera, and indeed few Bengalis have blood group O. In scanning blood group genes, the researchers were not able to pick up any negative selection against the O group genes. But they unexpectedly found evidence of natural selection having favored a minor blood type known as the Kell blood group. The genes of this group have no known connection with cholera but seem to offer a defense against arsenic. The poison contaminates the groundwater of Bangladesh, having been released by the tube wells dug to secure clean water to protect against cholera. The presence of protective genes in the Bengali population, if verified, would suggest arsenic is not just a modern problem but has been unleashed by monsoons or other natural phenomena for thousands of years.\nAs a necessary preliminary to testing for natural selection, the researchers looked at the racial composition of the Bengali population and found that they are an Indian population with a 9 percent admixture of East Asian genes, probably Chinese. The admixture occurred almost exactly 52 generations ago, according to statistical calculation, or around A.D. 500, assuming 29 years per generation. The Gupta empire in India was in decline at this time, but it is unclear whether the intermarriage with East Asians took place through trade or conquest. \u201cWe can now go back to the historians and see what happened then,\u201d Dr. Karlsson said.\nJohn Mekalanos, a cholera expert at the Harvard Medical School, said the new finding was one of several that \u201care starting to give a strong impression that the human genome has been dramatically shaped by responses to microorganisms.\u201d The discovery that Bengalis enjoy special resistance to cholera may help explain why much stronger doses of vaccine are needed to immunize them than are required for North American populations, Dr. Mekalanos said. The difference is usually attributed to differences in gut bacteria, but genetics now offers an alternative explanation.",

    "text": "Ceiling Collapse at Shoe Factory in Cambodia Kills 2\n2013-05-16T04:43:35.000Z\nHONG KONG \u2014 A ceiling at a small factory making shoes on the outskirts of the capital of Cambodia collapsed on Thursday morning, killing at least two workers and underlining global worries about factory safety in poor countries.\nKen Loo, the secretary general of the Garment Manufacturers Association in Cambodia, said that steel beams holding up a concrete-floored storage area at mezzanine height between two building had given way. In addition to the two dead, nine workers were injured, three of them severely, by falling pieces of concrete, Mr. Loo said.\nThe collapse outside the capital, Phnom Penh, came 22 days after the collapse of a garment factory complex in Bangladesh killed at least 1,127 people and prompted an international outcry for multinational retailers to assume more responsibility for the safety of workers at their suppliers.\nMultinationals have been looking to Cambodia as one of several countries that could be alternatives to Bangladesh. Cambodia has some of the lowest pay in Asia, with workers earning $120 a month in salary and benefits before overtime. That compares with just $37 in Bangladesh.\nBruce Rockowitz, the group president and chief executive at Hong Kong-based Li & Fung, one of the world\u2019s largest sourcing companies, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday, before the Cambodian factory collapse, that the collapse of the factory in Dhaka had already taught multinationals that visual inspections of factories\u2019 structural stability was not enough.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWe visually always inspected them, but you need true engineers,\u201d he said.",

    "text": "Good Intent a Casualty of Factory Crash\n2013-06-17T11:23:12.000Z\nSAVAR, Bangladesh \u2014 When the Spanish garment maker David Mayor arrived in Bangladesh a decade ago, the fashion label he set up had the motto \u201cClothing with a heart.\u201d\nIn an industry notorious for harsh working conditions, he said he wanted to show that it was possible to run an ethical business in which workers were trained well and treated with respect.\nThe story of how that dream ended in the rubble of Rana Plaza, an eight-story factory complex that collapsed in April, killing 1,129 people in one of the world\u2019s worst industrial accidents, is a cautionary tale for global retailers now scrambling to prevent another fatal accident in Bangladesh.\nRana Plaza was built on swampy ground with substandard concrete. It was designed as a five-story shopping center, but the owner of the building, a local political leader, rented it out to factory owners and built three more floors.\n\u201cDavid tried to do something good, better than the locals, but finally he was overtaken,\u201d said Brother Massimo Cattaneo, a Roman Catholic missionary who runs a technical school in northern Bangladesh and worked with Mr. Mayor on a training program he funded there.\nDespite repeated attempts in Spain and Bangladesh, Reuters was unable to contact Mr. Mayor for comment. He has made no public statements since the accident and it was not possible to establish whether he had hired a lawyer.\nMr. Mayor had nothing to do with the construction of Rana Plaza. But as a part owner of a factory in the building, Mr. Mayor, who was not in Bangladesh at the time, is one of those named as under investigation in the police investigation opened after the disaster. He has not been arrested.\nAll the other factory owners named by the police, including Mr. Mayor\u2019s partner, are in custody while the investigation is completed. Although none have been charged, a government panel has recommended that they face charges of culpable homicide, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.\nInterviews with former employees, clients and associates of Mr. Mayor\u2019s show that he invested in workers and appears to have been popular with his staff. But some employees also said that conditions in the factory had gradually deteriorated as the company began to focus on winning larger orders.\nThe Bangladeshi garment industry employs four million people, mostly women. While the jobs give the women economic power and an independence they did not have before, many work long hours in poorly ventilated, fire-trap factories.\nAt first, Mr. Mayor thought he could change that, negotiating with buyers for longer deadlines to avoid excessive overtime, according to people who worked with him. He set up a fashion label, Tacsocial, that advertised its ethical credentials with the \u201cheart\u201d slogan and motif.\nIn 2007, at age 29, he started another clothing firm, Phantom TAC, a joint venture with a local partner, Aminul Islam, documents seen by Reuters show.\n\u201cWorkers\u2019 conditions are not bad, but we want to improve them further,\u201d Mr. Mayor told The Daily Star in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, in 2008. A few weeks later, Phantom TAC opened the factory at Rana Plaza, in an industrial suburb of Dhaka.\nBrother Cattaneo said the factory had seemed safe, and several workers interviewed by Reuters said that at the start, things had been better than in many other factories.\nOne of Mr. Mayor\u2019s steadiest clients was the Spanish catalogue-sales company Cristian Lay, which worked with Phantom TAC from 2007 to 2012 and helped fund Brother Cattaneo\u2019s training program for the poor, rural women who flock to Dhaka in search of work.\nDomingo Gonzalez, head of quality control for Cristian Lay, said he had visited the factory frequently and had been impressed.\nAt the beginning, Mr. Mayor lived in Dhaka\u2019s diplomatic zone and visited the factory most days, former employees said. He spoke a smattering of Bengali and called members of his staff \u201cbrother,\u201d which was well received.\nBut about a year after the Rana Plaza factory opened, he moved back to Spain to focus on marketing, traveling to Bangladesh every few weeks with new clients, several employees said.\nThat, some workers said, is when the problems began.\nThe reason for the change is not clear, but a deteriorating economy in Europe, his principal market, may have made it harder for Mr. Mayor to develop a dream of more ethical fashion. \nPhantom TAC began to focus on large export deals.\nIn the days before the disaster, it was working flat-out to complete a sample order for the Spanish retailer Mango in the hope that it would lead to a bigger, lucrative supply contract with the company, one of the world\u2019s top buyers.\nMango, which has more than 2,600 outlets in 107 countries, said it had not completed the order, which was found in the rubble. \nUnder pressure to meet mounting orders, line managers drove employees harder, sometimes making them work through the night, some workers said. Reuters was not able to speak to any line managers from the company.\nOn the morning of April 24, managers ordered employees into work at the five factories in Rana Plaza, even though it had been evacuated the day before after a crack had appeared in a pillar.\nMinutes after they sat down, the power went out in the building and heavy generators on the upper floors kicked in with a shudder. The building shook hard and crashed to the ground.\nAmarat Hossain, a merchandiser who had worked for Mr. Mayor since 2007 coordinating with buyers, said he had been late to work that day, and by the time he arrived, Rana Plaza had collapsed into a mound of broken concrete.\nAs he frantically tried to contact colleagues, his mobile phone rang. It was his boss, asking why he could not reach the Phantom TAC chairman, Mr. Islam.\nMr. Hossain said that when he had told him the news, Mr. Mayor broke down, screaming, \u201cOh, God \u2026 oh, God,\u201d into the phone and asking, \u201cAre they all dead?\u201d\nIndustry officials said 200 workers and managers had died at Phantom TAC, with dozens more severely injured. Reuters spoke to several survivors.\nAll the workers spoken to remembered Mr. Mayor as a benevolent figure, who always had a kind word and was opposed to forced overtime. \nBut the labor activist Babul Akhter said he believed that Mr. Mayor could have found out about the worsening conditions from factory log books that documented the hours being clocked.\nMr. Mayor was last seen in Bangladesh in March. Two people who know Mr. Mayor, and the Bangladeshi Consulate in Barcelona, said he was in Spain, but Reuters was unable to locate him.\nMainuddin Khandaker, a senior home ministry official, said a decision on whether to charge Mr. Mayor would be made on the basis of the evidence.\nMr. Hossain, the merchandiser, said he had spoken to Mr. Mayor \u201cthree or four times\u201d by telephone since the accident.\n\u201cHe said his next step is prove he was in no way involved in this whole process, because he didn\u2019t know anything about the crack. He was very upset,\u201d he said. ",

    "text": "Retailers Split on Contrition After Collapse of Factories\n2013-05-01T01:48:05.000Z\nThe building collapse in Bangladesh that caused at least 386 deaths has produced some jarringly different responses from Western apparel retailers and brands that obtained goods from factories inside the building.\nSeveral American and European retailers have sought to minimize any ties they had to factories inside the building, Rana Plaza, while some other companies have been quick to acknowledge their ties to those garment suppliers \u2014 and have pledged to contribute to a fund to help families of the victims. \nIn addition, representatives of two dozen retailers and apparel brands, including Walmart, Gap, H&M and Carrefour, met outside Frankfurt on Monday to discuss what can be done to improve factory safety in Bangladesh. Two labor advocates who attended the meeting \u2014 which the German government had arranged long before last Wednesday\u2019s factory collapse \u2014 said it remained unclear whether those companies would agree to the financial commitments needed to ensure safety at the more than 4,000 garment factories in Bangladesh. \nThe Children\u2019s Place, a retail chain based in Secaucus, N.J., that operates 1,100 stores, said that although a garment factory inside Rana Plaza had produced apparel for it, \u201cnone of our apparel was in production\u201d there \u201cat the time of this terrible tragedy.\u201d \nCustoms documents show that over the past eight months, the New Wave factory inside Rana Plaza had made more than 120,000 pounds of clothing that had been sent in 21 shipments to the Children\u2019s Place. A two-ton shipment arrived in Savannah, Ga., on April 5.\nThe Cato Corporation, a retailer of women\u2019s clothing that has more than 1,300 stores in 31 states, also played down any link to the building. In a statement, Cato said New Wave Bottoms, also located there, \u201cwas a factory of one of our vendors.\u201d \n\u201cHowever, we did not have any ongoing production at the time of the incident,\u201d the statement said.\nNew Wave Bottoms has shipped more than 90,000 pounds of apparel to Cato since November, customs documents show, with nine tons arriving at the Port of Charleston in South Carolina in February. \nAfter Bangladeshi labor groups said they had found labels of Benetton clothing in the rubble, Benetton initially denied using any factories in the building. But as more labels and documents showing Benetton orders were found and publicized, the company revised its response, saying it had placed only a one-time order there and had severed ties with that factory.\nIneke Zeldenrust, international coordinator of the Clean Clothes Campaign, an anti-sweatshop group based in Amsterdam, criticized Western companies that sought to distance themselves from the building that collapsed. \u201cIt is high time for Benetton to stop this senseless game of always trying to pretend they\u2019re not there,\u201d she said. \nPrimark, a low-price British retailer, quickly acknowledged that one of its suppliers had occupied the second floor of the eight-story building. Primark has pledged to compensate victims who worked for its supplier and their families, saying compensation would include long-term aid for children who lost parents, financial aid for the injured and payments to the families of the deceased. \n\u201cPrimark notes the fact that its supplier shared the building with those of other retailers,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe are fully aware of our responsibility. We urge these other retailers to come forward and offer assistance.\u201d\nLoblaw, a Canadian discount chain, and El Corte Ingl\u00e9s, a prominent Spanish retailer, have also pledged to participate in a compensation fund.\nMs. Zeldenrust called on all Western companies that had obtained garments from the five factories inside Rana Plaza to create a $30 million compensation fund, and praised those that had already agreed to contribute.\nOn Monday, she attended the meeting that the German Agency for International Cooperation had called to help upgrade factory safety in Bangladesh. Worker advocacy groups are urging Western companies to join a plan \u2014 embraced so far by just PVH, the parent company of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, and Tchibo, a German retailer \u2014 for independent inspections and for the Western companies to underwrite any needed building or fire safety improvements.\n\u201cIt was a productive meeting, but there was no concrete outcome,\u201d Ms. Zeldenrust said. She added that a deadline was set, and \u201cby May 15, we should know whether there will be a plan.\u201d",

    "text": "Clothing Brands Sidestep Blame for Safety Lapses\n2013-12-31T01:03:09.000Z\nPARETS DEL VALL\u00c8S, Spain \u2014 From a sleek gray distribution center near Barcelona, the global fashion brand Mango ships 60 million garments in a year. Automated conveyor belts whir through the building like subway lines, sorting and organizing blouses, sweaters and other items to be shipped around the world. Human hands barely touch the clothes.\nFive thousand miles away in Bangladesh, the Phantom Tac factory in the industrial suburb of Savar was a hive of human hands. Hundreds of men and women hunched over sewing machines to produce garments in an assembly line system unchanged for years. Speed was also essential, but that just meant people had to work faster.\nLast spring, as it pushed forward with global expansion plans, Mango turned to Phantom Tac to produce a sample order of polo shirts and other items. Then, on April 24, the Rana Plaza factory complex collapsed, killing more than 1,100 people in the deadliest disaster in garment industry history, and destroying Phantom Tac and other operations in the building.\nNow, eight months later, the question is what responsibility Mango and other brands should bear toward the victims of Rana Plaza, a disaster that exposed the murkiness and lack of accountability in the global supply chain for clothes. Under intense international pressure, four brands agreed last week to help finance a landmark $40 million compensation fund for the victims.\nBut many other brands, including Mango, have so far refused to contribute to the fund. Mango argues that it is not responsible because it had not \u201cformalized a commercial relationship\u201d with Phantom Tac. Company officials say that Mango was still conducting quality inspections and factory audits of Phantom Tac, and that the factory had not started producing samples for an order of 25,000 items.\nBut in interviews conducted over several months, supervisors and other employees from Phantom Tac said work to make samples for Mango had already begun when Rana Plaza collapsed. Fabric was being marked and cut, and some workers say some sample shirts were already being stitched.\n\u201cThere was an urgency among the bosses,\u201d said Mohammed Mosharuf Hossain, 28, who worked in a cutting section. \u201cThe managers told us to finish the Mango products urgently. They said if we could finish this work quickly, we might get more orders from Mango.\u201d\nFor global brands and retailers, Rana Plaza has forced a reckoning over how to reconcile the mismatched pieces in their supply chains. Technology and investment are transforming the upper end of the industry, enabling Mango and other brands to increase sales, manage global inventories with pinpoint precision and introduce new clothes faster than ever \u2014 all as consumers now expect to see new things every time they visit a store.\nBut these brands depend on factories in developing countries like Bangladesh, where wages are very low and the pressure to work faster and cheaper has spawned familiar problems: unsafe buildings, substandard work conditions and repeated wage and labor violations. Consumers know little about these factories, even as global brands promise that their clothes are made in safe environments.\nPhantom Tac could be regarded as an unlikely attempt to prove that a Bangladeshi factory could be socially responsible and make a profit. It was partly owned by a Spaniard, David Mayor, who had won orders from several Spanish brands. He had teamed up with a Vatican missionary in rural Bangladesh to offer a training program for female workers. And he had experimented with creating a website to allow consumers in the West to connect virtually with the workers sewing their clothes.\nBut the pressures on Phantom Tac to meet deadlines and make money made those social goals difficult to achieve. Employees said the factory was busy but had suffered setbacks: Inditex, the global clothing giant that owns Zara and Lefties, had canceled orders a year earlier after the factory failed a social compliance audit. And several employees said other problems had arisen after underage workers were discovered working as helpers.\nNow, Mr. Mayor has disappeared. He did not respond to email requests for interviews, and his family in Spain declined to reveal his whereabouts. His Bangladeshi business partner, Aminul Islam, is in jail in connection with the collapse.\nFactories like Phantom Tac in Bangladesh and the Mango operations in Spain are part of the same supply chains, but might as well be from different worlds.\nIn Spain, visitors to Mango\u2019s design center, a short drive from the distribution warehouse, are greeted in the lobby by an installation from the Spanish artist Jaume Plensa. A Picasso hangs in the office of Mango\u2019s chairman, Isak Andic. Employees eat in a light-filled cafeteria or can relax in an upstairs area filled with ferns called \u201cthe greenhouse.\u201d\nThese state-of-the-art facilities are just the beginning: Mango already operates other distribution centers in China, Hong Kong and Turkey, and it has broken ground for a massive new complex in Spain. Last year, Mango produced a total of 110 million garments and accessories; within a decade, company officials say, the company hopes to produce 300 million garments and roughly quintuple annual sales to 10 billion euros, or about $14 billion.\nThis growth strategy comes after Mango responded to the global recession by slashing prices, expanding offerings and opening stores in countries like China and Russia. This increased sales but has placed a premium on efficiency, cost and speed. In the past, Mango sent new items to stores every four to six weeks; now it is every 15 days. Technology has enabled Mango\u2019s distribution center in Spain to track global sales, down to a single item in a single store, and then ship out boxes of refill orders within eight hours.\n\u201cThe new facility will be faster, bigger and more efficient,\u201d said Jordi Torra Marin, a project manager.\nIn Bangladesh, the business environment presents a sharp contrast. Phantom Tac was on the fifth floor of Rana Plaza, which was named after the family of the building\u2019s owner, Sohel Rana. Mr. Rana, now in jail awaiting charges in the collapse, was a local political strongman, with close ties to elected officials in Savar and a reputation for criminal activities. Workers inside Rana Plaza say that when Mr. Rana needed people to stage a political march or a protest, he demanded that factory bosses release some workers from each factory to participate.\nMr. Rana also extracted profits: He controlled food services that served snacks to workers during overtime. Several workers complained about the foul taste of the food. Mr. Rana also claimed the leftover remnants of fabric produced by each factory and sold them into the lucrative local recycling market. And, workers say, he took any garments that did not meet quality standards and sold them in local markets.\n\u201cHe was so powerful,\u201d said Mohammad Liton, 25, a quality controller at Phantom Tac. \u201cHe had his own gang. They used to operate businesses.\u201d\nDavid Mayor was a buyer when he met Aminul Islam, who was operating a different factory in the center of Dhaka, the national capital. They started Phantom Tac together, which seemed like a good fit, since Mr. Mayor had connections with foreign brands, especially those in Spain. Soon, Mr. Mayor was bringing in orders, workers said, or leading foreign buyers on tours of the factory.\nMr. Mayor also had a social agenda. In 2007, Mr. Mayor joined with Brother Massimo Cattaneo, a Roman Catholic missionary, and financed a training program for young girls from rural Bangladesh. He eventually hired about a dozen of the graduates into his own factory.\nHe also wanted to give consumers a better understanding of how their clothes were made. Ashley Wheaton, who had worked for a nonprofit group in Dhaka, was hired to develop a website where consumers could type in a code taken from the sales tag of an item and then learn about the Bangladeshi women who made the garment they had bought. As an experiment, Mr. Mayor opened a shop in Dhaka where the clothes were marked with the codes.\n\u201cHe had this idea about what he wanted to accomplish,\u201d Ms. Wheaton said. \u201cHe really did want to change the way things are done. But he was pragmatic. He knew it had to make money and be sustainable.\u201d\nBut money became a problem. Ms. Wheaton left after about seven months, as the factory began tightening expenses. Eventually, Mr. Mayor also stopped funding the training program, which Brother Massimo has kept afloat through church money and donations.\nWorkers at Phantom Tac said deadline pressures were relentless. Margins were so tight that several workers say midlevel managers used two sets of accounting ledgers to hide excessive overtime or other wage violations. Workers also said a problem with child labor arose in 2012 after a buyer discovered several teenagers working as helpers, the lowest-level position in the factory.\nBy January 2013, Phantom Tac had corrected the child labor issue and was trying to win new business, including from Mango. Mango had sent buyers to the factory as well as inspectors to conduct an audit of working conditions, workers say.\n\u201cWe all knew about Mango\u2019s audit team,\u201d said Mr. Hossain, the man from the cutting section. \u201cThere was an announcement on the loudspeaker. They told everyone to work properly. They wanted to impress them.\u201d\nIt worked. Labor activists searching the rubble of Rana Plaza found order forms from Mango to Phantom Tac for adult polo shirts and some children\u2019s items. By April, but before the collapse, the fabric for the Mango order had already arrived, several employees say. Work was underway on samples to be sent to Mango for approval. One worker, Mohammed Sohel, said some sample shirts had already been sent for quality testing by Mango, only for Phantom Tac to be told of a flaw in the collar.\n\u201cDavid came to the factory and explained how to correct the collar,\u201d Mr. Sohel said.\nAnother employee, Mohammed Sumon Prodhan, who worked in quality control, said seamstresses had been making samples of green polo shirts for Mango the day before Rana Plaza collapsed.\nIn a recent interview at Mango\u2019s design center in Spain, Jose Gomez, vice president of international business development, cited Mango\u2019s involvement in a major consortium of brands that have agreed to help finance safety upgrades to Bangladeshi factories as evidence of the company\u2019s commitment to improve conditions.\nBut on the separate issue of compensation for victims, Mr. Gomez denied that Mango had started production at Phantom Tac because, he said, the company\u2019s auditing process was not complete. \nAsked if he was certain no work was underway, Mr. Gomez said, \u201cWhat I understand is what I told you.\u201d\nEva Kreisler, a coordinator for the anti-sweatshop group Clean Clothes Campaign in Spain, said that Mango\u2019s explanation was unconvincing and that the company had a moral obligation to help the victims of Rana Plaza.\nAnother Spanish retailer, El Corte Ingl\u00e9s, is one of four brands that have agreed to contribute to the $40 million fund. Officials say other brands must come forward if full funding is to be achieved.\n\u201cDefinitely, they should contribute to the fund,\u201d Ms. Kreisler said of Mango. \u201cIt is quite shameful that they still won\u2019t contribute to bring justice to the workers.\u201d\nOn the day before Rana Plaza collapsed, cracks appeared in the third floor of the building. It was temporarily closed, and an engineer, upon inspecting the cracks, said the building should remain closed. But Mr. Islam, the co-owner of Phantom Tac, called a longtime factory supervisor and implored him and others to return to work, citing pressing deadlines.\nMr. Islam even went to the building himself and made his ritual evening prayers.\n\u201cHe called me,\u201d said Mohammad Minhaj Uddin Nannu, the longtime supervisor. \u201cHe said, \u2018Why are you all scared? You shouldn\u2019t be. I\u2019m here.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nThe next morning, Rana Plaza collapsed, before Mr. Islam arrived at his office.",

    "text": "The Hidden Costs of Buying on the Cheap\n2013-05-17T13:22:24.000Z\nNEW YORK \u2014 The Children\u2019s Place, a clothing-store chain, has acknowledged sourcing from the Bangladeshi factory complex that collapsed last month and killed more than 1,100 people. But far from the rubble, on a slow day at a store in the Flatlands section of Brooklyn, the faraway deaths had yet to inspire a new awareness about the people who stitch the $4 \u201cRoyal Cutie\u201d T-shirts, $9 floral onesies and $10 blue plaid shorts.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t really let us know where the clothes are made,\u201d a Children\u2019s Place saleswoman said, handling wares whose labels disclose only countries \u2014 Vietnam, China, Bangladesh. \u201cI guess that\u2019s not really our business. We just sell them.\u201d\nMysterious origins are a hidden cost of cheap things. To spend a day in the diverse stores of New York \u2014 from the working-class area of Flatlands to the gentrifying Brooklyn neighborhood of Park Slope to the moneyed Upper East Side \u2014 is to encounter yet another line dividing the prosperous from the poor.\nTo have money today is often to acquire the right to know which person knitted your sweater or which farm bred the pigs in your chorizo. To be without money is to buy from a placeless netherworld and be told to take it or leave it, no questions asked.\nIt\u2019s a strange reversal. For most of history, the poor would have eaten the local pigs and known the origin of their socks, and the rich had better access to a global marketplace. But changing elite tastes and the relentless efficiency of supply chains have slowly inverted tastes: In many categories, the poor now buy from the exotic unknown, and the rich insist on what can be traced, from the pig next door to the locally sewn sock.\nAt the Payless Shoesource down the street from The Children\u2019s Place, origins are hidden \u2014 under the tongues of shoes, or inside where the ankles lurk. \u201cThey all say \u2018Made in China,\u201d\u2019 a saleswoman says, when asked about the shoes\u2019 manufacture. \u201cThat I know. But they don\u2019t tell us anything else.\u201d\nNow get on the No. 5 train and get off 17 stops later at 59th Street, on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side.\nWalk into The Art of Shaving on Madison Avenue, whose Fusion Engraved Nickel Plated Shaving Set costs $600. If, when the clerk offers help, you decline and say you\u2019re browsing, she might insist nonetheless. She offers an origin story about the husband and wife who sold their car for $12,000 and started this store \u2014 with this as their first location of dozens. Rich products, like rich people, have histories; poor products only have pasts.\nAt the Barneys department store nearby, walk up to the woman at the Delvaux counter, selling pricey leather accessories. She will volunteer that her brand is eight years older than Herm\u00e8s; that the goods are made in a factory in Brussels; that this one is lizard skin, and that one ostrich. In an alcove around the corner are the products of the Maison Goyard, a maker of bags and trunks. Like many products for the wealthy, Goyard announces its origins \u2014 Paris \u2014 on the logo of the product rather than hidden away. On some, Goyard includes an address: 233 rue Saint-Honor\u00e9.\nOver in Park Slope, at the fancy Bklyn Larder provisions shop, it is much the same. Because it caters to the moneyed classes now migrating to Brooklyn, everything must be from somewhere. It\u2019s not hidden in labels, but right out front: New Hampshire cider, Ithaca milk yogurt, cheese-and-pecan crackers in which the cheese is from Bravo Farms in California and the pecans are from New Mexico.\nFour blocks away, the Key Food supermarket, catering more to the neighborhood\u2019s less-affluent old guard than its newcomers, is less forthcoming with detail. The food is mostly from nowhere.\nIt often seems to be from somewhere. The label may say \u201cBolthouse Farms,\u201d without mentioning that it\u2019s not a farm so much as a vast business owned by the Campbell Soup Co. When places are cited, they are often no more specific than \u201cProduct of U.S.A.\u201d The sweet mixed pickles, less than half the price per unit of similar ones at Larder, offer no more history than to say that they are distributed by Key Food.\nWhen the buck stops at Key Food, it tends to stop no further back than the distributor.\nBack at The Children\u2019s Place, Marsha Toombs was browsing the racks. She is 30 and pregnant with her third child. Her daughter was cruising the clothes, full of requests: \u201cMommy, can I have a purse? Ooh, Mommy, can I have these shorts?\u201d\nMs. Toombs was disturbed by events in Bangladesh. \u201cMe personally, I don\u2019t agree with the outsourcing,\u201d she said. She blamed it for a dearth of jobs in America, and for giving low-income foreigners a devil\u2019s bargain \u2014 either don\u2019t eat, or labor in danger.\nWhy, then, was she buying these clothes? She struggled. \u201cThat\u2019s where it gets really tricky, because if the economy is bad and things are tight financially, you\u2019ve got to bargain,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess \u2014 man \u2014 that\u2019s where the dilemma comes into play.\u201d\nHow much extra would she pay \u2014 say, for the $15 jeans in her cart \u2014 to have them made closer to home, in better conditions?\n\u201cSee, I\u2019m a bargain queen,\u201d she said, hesitating. She settled on $5 extra and no more. And she wasn\u2019t convinced about the jeans, either: \u201cI\u2019m going to go to Target and see if I can get something cheaper.\u201d\nJoin an online conversation at http://anand.ly and follow on Twitter.com/anandwrites ",

    "text": "Some Retailers Say More About Their Clothing\u2019s Origins\n2013-05-08T16:56:25.000Z\nThe revolution that has swept the food industry is expanding to retail: origins matter. \nWith fair-trade coffee and organic fruit now standard on grocery shelves, consumers concerned with working conditions, environmental issues and outsourcing are increasingly demanding similar accountability for their T-shirts. The issue has been brought to the forefront by the garment factory collapse in Bangladesh, which killed more than 800 people. \nAnd some retailers are doing what was once unthinkable, handing over information about exactly how, and where, their products were made.\nEverlane, an online boutique, last week added paragraphs to its Web site describing the factories where its products are made. \nNordstrom says it is considering adding information about clothes produced in humane working conditions. \nAn online boutique breaks down the number of workers involved in making each item and the cost of every component, while a textiles company intends to trumpet the fair-trade origins of its robes when Bed Bath & Beyond starts selling them this month. \nAnd a group of major retailers and apparel companies, including some \u2014 like Nike and Walmart \u2014 with a history of controversial manufacturing practices overseas, says it is developing an index that will include labor, social and environmental measures. \nNew research indicates a growing consumer demand for information about how and where goods are produced. A study last year by professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard showed that some consumers \u2014 even those who were focused on discount prices \u2014 were not only willing to pay more, but actually did pay more, for clothes that carried signs about fair-labor practices. \n\u201cThere\u2019s real demand for sweat-free products,\u201d said Ian Robinson, a lecturer and research scientist at the University of Michigan who studies labor issues. Consumers \u201cdon\u2019t have the information they need, and they do care.\u201d \nThe garment factory collapse that killed more than 800 workers in Bangladesh last month has added urgency to the movement, as retailers have seen queries stream in from worried customers.\n\u201cIn the clothing industry, everybody wears it every day, but we have no idea where it comes from,\u201d said Michael Preysman, Everlane\u2019s chief executive and founder. \u201cPeople are starting to slowly clue in to this notion of where products are made.\u201d\nMajor retailers have long balked at disclosing the full trail, saying that sourcing is inherently complex \u2014 a sweater made in Italy may have thread, wool and dye from elsewhere. Another reason: Workplace protections are expensive, and cheap clothes, no matter where or how they are manufactured, still sell, as H&M, Zara and Joe Fresh show through their rapid expansion. \nBut labor advocates note that consumers\u2019 appetite for more information may put competitive pressure on retailers who are less than forthcoming. In recent weeks, government officials, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, and labor and consumer advocates have cited the Bangladesh collapse in calling for the adoption of fair-trade standards or labeling. In direct response to what happened in Bangladesh, Everlane added information to its Web site about the factories where its clothing is made. \u201cThis factory is located 10 minutes from our L.A. office,\u201d one description for a T-shirt reads . \u201cMr. Kim, the owner, has been in the L.A. garment business for over 30 years.\u201d\nEverlane says it will soon add cost breakdowns for all of its clothing, along with photographs of factories where that clothing is made and information about the production. \nMr. Preysman says Everlane has long received questions from customers \u201caround where the products are sourced from and how we can tell that the labor is good.\u201d It is an inexact science, he said. But he added that he looks for factories certified by independent outside organizations and has executives spend time with a factory\u2019s owner to see if he or she \u201cis a decent human being.\u201d \nHonest By, a high-fashion site introduced last year, includes even more specific information about its products. Take a cotton shirt that costs about $320: it took 33 minutes to cut, 145 minutes to assemble and 10 minutes to iron at a Belgian factory, then the trim took an additional 10 minutes at a Slovenian plant. The safety pin cost 4 cents, and transportation about $10.50. \nBruno Pieters, the site\u2019s founder, said by e-mail that \u201cas long as we keep paying companies to be unsustainable and unethical, they will be.\u201d But, he said, that may be changing. He cited a spike in sales that he asserted was in response to issues raised by recent overseas sourcing disasters. \nLush Cosmetics, a company based in Britain, has added video from its factories and photographs from buying trips to places like Kenya and Ghana to its Facebook page. Simon Constantine, head perfumer and ethical buyer, said he would like to add links to the factories Lush buys from, to encourage other cosmetics companies to support them. \nNordstrom said it had provided factory information in response to shoppers\u2019 calls, and was considering going a step further, said Tara Darrow, a spokeswoman. The Nordstrom Web site specifies eco-friendly products, \u201cso how can we do the same with people-friendly?\u201d Ms. Darrow asked. \u201cHearing from customers and knowing they care definitely compels us to want to do more.\u201d\nA variety of groups are working on new apparel industry labor standards.\nThe Sustainable Apparel Coalition, which includes big names like Nike, Walmart, Gap, J. C. Penney and Target, has been testing an index called the Higg Index. It started last year with environmental goals, but the new version due this fall will include social and labor measurements. \nThe coalition was formed in 2011 to create one industry standard for sustainability and labor practices, rather than a patchwork approach. Some of the companies supporting this index have had sourcing problems \u2014 Walmart subcontractors were using the Tazreen factory, the Bangladesh plant where a fire killed 112 workers last November. Gap, Target and Penney produced clothing at another Bangladesh factory, where a fire killed about 30 workers in 2010. Nike, which faced a global boycott over sweatshop conditions in its overseas factories, was among the first major apparel companies pressured to disclose the factories it uses. \nFor now, the index is just for companies\u2019 internal use. But Jason Kibbey, executive director of the coalition, said the goal was to give the information to shoppers, too, through a label or via the Web or apps. Labor advocates like Scott Nova, executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, however, say that self-regulation may be ineffective.\nAnother certification, Fair Trade USA, began in coffee and only recently moved into apparel. PrAna, a yoga company that is among the first American apparel firms to be fair-trade certified, said the process included tours of its cut-and-sew plant in Liberia and other factories, a review of factory books and systems, and an assessment of workers\u2019 pay relative to local salaries. PrAna sold one fair-trade T-shirt in 2011, and now sells nine such products.\nThose products are priced 10 percent more than a comparable item, said its chief executive, Scott Kerslake, and they have been selling well, but PrAna has to be careful not to \u201ccompletely chase away consumers on it\u201d given the more expensive process. Now, it is trying to do more to alert consumers to the certification: the logo is only on PrAna\u2019s tags, but it plans to put the certification logo on garments. \nFor some shoppers, the fair-trade pitch goes only so far. Marci Zaroff, founder of Under the Canopy, which is introducing a fair-trade certified bathrobe at Bed Bath & Beyond this month, said it could be hard to convey the message, and \u201cthat\u2019s why we sell on style, quality and price.\u201d\nNeeru Paharia, an assistant professor at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown, recently completed a study on consumers\u2019 attitudes toward sweatshop labor. She found that the complex supply chain in retailing made it easier for consumers to justify poor labor practices. \n\u201cMost people probably would not hire a child, lock them in their basement, and have them make their clothes,\u201d she said, \u201cbut this system is so abstracted.\u201d \nShe also found that consumers were concerned with labor practices \u2014 as long as they were not that interested in buying a product like shoes. But \u201cif the shoes are cute \u2014 if they like the shoes \u2014 they actually think sweatshop labor is less wrong,\u201d she said.\nThe collapse in Bangladesh may be changing that. One look at the Facebook site of Joe Fresh, which produced clothing at that factory, suggests that customers are upset, and Joe Fresh\u2019s parent, Loblaw Companies, has vowed to audit factories more aggressively and compensate the victims\u2019 families. Shoppers like Lauri Langton, 62, of Seattle, plan to push retailers for more information. \u201cYou should be able to tell, right away, where the product is produced, so that you can walk away from the product and not buy it if you do not believe it was produced in a humane way,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s where we have power as consumers.\u201d",

    "text": "Sport of Many Nations Finds a Home in the Bronx\n2013-05-06T02:38:06.000Z\nThe ball came flying. The batter, in crisp game whites, slammed it into the ground, then bounded across a clay strip and back again, bat still in hand. His teammates cheered. And there was not a stray soccer ball or an invading rugby player in sight.\nCricket was finally getting some respect in the Bronx.\nThe borough of the Yankees has become a mecca for the British bat sport favored by many of New York City\u2019s West Indian and South Asian immigrants and their children. On Sunday, more than 100 cricket players joined diplomats from countries including Jamaica and Britain to break in 10 new cricket fields in Van Cortlandt Park that city officials say make up the largest site in the United States for the sport.\n\u201cWhen you see fields like this, you want to play,\u201d said Dolip Dhanpat, 40, a delivery driver who was waiting with his team to take a turn. \u201cIt\u2019s a blessing.\u201d\nThe new cricket complex, designed as part of a $13 million renovation of a wide, grassy expanse of Van Cortlandt Park once used as a parade ground, reflects the growing diversity of New Yorkers and their pastimes. About 10 percent of the city\u2019 8.2 million residents are of South Asian or West Indian descent, including a fast-expanding Bangladeshi population in the Bronx, according to an analysis of census data by Queens College.\nWith the new complex, the Bronx has a total of 18 dedicated cricket fields, more than any other borough, according to city officials. (Brooklyn is next with 16 fields, followed by Queens, with 13.) \n\u201cNo other borough has promoted the game to the extent that the Bronx has,\u201d said Lesly Lowe, an immigrant from Guyana who is president of the Commonwealth Cricket League, which is based in Van Cortlandt Park. \n\u201cIt is the borough,\u201d he added, \u201cthat started the ball rolling, as they say.\u201d\nMr. Lowe\u2019s league, which started in 1982, is the city\u2019s largest, with 2,000 players on 100 teams. Twenty-one of those teams are new this year, including four that are all Pakistani and a Bangladeshi team that calls itself the Bronx Tigers. Another cricket league and several school teams also play in the park.\nYet while cricket has thrived in the Bronx, it has often been an afterthought to baseball or soccer. The old cricket fields in Van Cortlandt Park, if they could be called that, were too small for games and overlapped in places. The fields had to be shared with soccer, rugby and football teams, who, cricket players said, mucked up the grass and left holes everywhere. Soccer balls often came bouncing into cricket games.\nBy contrast, the new fields sitting side by side have been carefully measured to regulation size and declared off limits to other sports. There is a drainage system to minimize puddles, and a newly posted map to mark the fields, lest there be any confusion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s 100 percent better,\u201d said Everald Wellington, 59, a food handler who has also played in Queens and Brooklyn. \u201cI\u2019m home, I\u2019m right in my house. It\u2019s very special to me.\u201d\nThe cricket complex took three years to complete, one more than planned, city officials said, because the grass seed did not take and had to be replanted. \nMilford Lewis, president of the New York Cricket League, which plays only in Van Cortlandt Park and suspended its games during that time, said some players had grown impatient and decamped to leagues in Brooklyn and New Jersey. But Mr. Lewis said that he was pleased with the results. \n\u201cIt\u2019s bigger, wider, greener and more luscious,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a far cry from where it was before. I feel on top of the world.\u201d\nThe fields have already attracted one new player. Mark Daly, 44, a paralegal, stopped by on Sunday afternoon with a handmade cricket bat after hearing that there was cricket-playing in the park.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t played for years, but it\u2019s in my blood,\u201d he said as he watched 10 cricket games going on simultaneously. \n\u201cI think the sport is really going to take off in the Bronx.\u201d",

    "text": "Leishmaniasis: A Genetic Link Found in Far-Flung Victims of a Lethal Form of a Parasitic Disease\n2013-01-14T20:08:35.000Z\nWhether someone bitten by a sandfly goes on to develop the most lethal form of leishmaniasis is determined partly by the victim\u2019s own genes, a new study suggests.\nLeishmaniasis, caused by parasites injected by sandfly bites, has two forms: painful skin sores (known to American troops in Iraq as \u201cBaghdad boils\u201d) or, in less than 20 percent of cases, the visceral form, sometimes called \u201ckala azar,\u201d that attacks the organs and is fatal if untreated. About 400,000 visceral cases develop annually, 90 percent of them in three places far from one another and with different parasite subspecies: northeastern Brazil, the India-Bangladesh border and the Horn of Africa.\nBecause the disease hits some families harder, a genetic propensity to get it has been long suspected. The study, published in Nature Genetics last week, compared DNA in almost 6,000 blood samples from India and Brazil. Both Indians and Brazilians who got visceral leishmaniasis had similar DNA variations. \nResearchers are not sure what those mutations do, but the nearest stretch of DNA determines how white blood cells \u201cgrab\u201d invaders to trigger immune responses, said Peter J. Donnelly, an Oxford statistics professor who also heads the Wellcome Trust Center for Human Genetics and was one of the paper\u2019s authors.\nWhile it is widely known that immune-system genes influence susceptibility to cancer, learning that they may also control susceptibility to a parasitic disease was \u201cquite interesting,\u201d Dr. Donnelly said.

    "text": "Wal-Mart Sales Go Cold, and Its Shares Feel the Chill \n2013-05-16T12:18:41.000Z\nDespite several quarters of controversy over bribery allegations in Mexico, Wal-Mart Stores\u2019 profitable earnings and strong sales in recent quarters made it a Wall Street darling, and its stock price hit a record high on Wednesday.\nOn Thursday, though, the company\u2019s financial picture worsened as it reported quarterly results that missed analysts\u2019 expectations, citing factors like a cold spring season and late tax refunds, and the stock price began to decline. Shares fell $1.36 to close at $78.50. \n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have the first-quarter performance we wanted,\u201d Michael T. Duke, the chief executive, said in a statement. \nNet income rose 1.1 percent, to $3.8 billion, up 1.1 percent from the period a year earlier, while revenue rose 1 percent, to $114.2 billion; analysts expected revenue of $116.3 billion.\nUnited States same-store sales dropped for the first time since the summer of 2011, declining by 1.4 percent, versus Wal-Mart\u2019s projection of around flat. Visits to stores also fell, by 1.8 percent in the quarter.\nWhile consumers remained under pressure, nothing drastic had changed in their economic state in the quarter, said Charles M. Holley Jr., Wal-Mart\u2019s chief financial officer, in a call with reporters. Instead, the lower-than-expected sales in the United States were because of colder weather than last year, the payroll tax increase, tax refunds that came in later than usual and little inflation in food prices.\nInternationally, the company\u2019s sales grew 2.9 percent, to $33 billion, and Wal-Mart said it increased market share in several countries despite the weak sales. Mr. Duke said that the company was \u201cdisappointed in our expense control in International\u201d; Mr. Holley explained that Walmart International lacks many of the tools the domestic business does in terms of forecasting when employees need to be in stores or when customer traffic will spike.\nOn a per-share basis, earnings for the fiscal first quarter, which ended April 30, were up 4.6 percent to $1.14 a share, a penny below analysts\u2019 expectations. The company forecast lower second-quarter profit than the $1.29 a share analysts were expecting, giving a range of $1.22 to $1.27. Its shares closed down 1.7 percent.\nExpenses for the quarter shot up by 44.4 percent, or $200 million, mostly because of a larger-than-expected bill for the bribery allegations in Mexico Last year, The New York Times reported that Wal-Mart de Mexico officials had paid bribes to smooth expansion in the country, and executives at the company\u2019s Bentonville, Ark., headquarters had known of the bribes and declined to take action. After learning of The Times\u2019s investigation, Wal-Mart began an inquiry into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and also began a compliance review.\nThe company spent $73 million on expenses associated with those reviews, while it had expected to spend only $40 million to $45 million. Excluding that cost, Wal-Mart said its corporate expenses would have increased by just 14.6 percent. Mr. Holley said that Wal-Mart expects to spend $65 million to $70 million on those expenses in the second quarter.\nMore recently, labor and consumer groups have been pressuring Wal-Mart to take steps to ensure factory safety in Bangladesh, where it produces many of its goods and where a building collapse last month killed more than 1,000 workers. \nThis week, Wal-Mart announced it would not join a broad factory safety plan supported by H&M and other large retailers, but would pursue its own plan, including conducting inspections of the 279 Bangladeshi factories it uses.\nIt seems the working conditions in Bangladesh are not at the forefront for Walmart\u2019s shoppers. Mr. Holley said Thursday that \u201cwe really haven\u2019t had much feedback from that.\u201d",

    "text": "U.S. Flouts Its Own Advice in Procuring Overseas Clothing\n2013-12-23T03:54:13.000Z\nWASHINGTON \u2014 One of the world\u2019s biggest clothing buyers, the United States government spends more than $1.5 billion a year at factories overseas, acquiring everything from the royal blue shirts worn by airport security workers to the olive button-downs required for forest rangers and the camouflage pants sold to troops on military bases.\nBut even though the Obama administration has called on Western buyers to use their purchasing power to push for improved industry working conditions after several workplace disasters over the last 14 months, the American government has done little to adjust its own shopping habits.\nLabor Department officials say that federal agencies have \u201czero tolerance\u201d for using overseas plants that break local laws, but American government suppliers in countries including Bangladesh, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Mexico, Pakistan and Vietnam show a pattern of legal violations and harsh working conditions, according to audits and interviews at factories. Among them: padlocked fire exits, buildings at risk of collapse, falsified wage records and repeated hand punctures from sewing needles when workers were pushed to hurry up.\nIn Bangladesh, shirts with Marine Corps logos sold in military stores were made at DK Knitwear, where child laborers made up a third of the work force, according to a 2010 audit that led some vendors to cut ties with the plant. Managers punched workers for missed production quotas, and the plant had no functioning alarm system despite previous fires, auditors said. Many of the problems remain, according to another audit this year and recent interviews with workers.\nIn Chiang Mai, Thailand, employees at the Georgie & Lou factory, which makes clothing sold by the Smithsonian Institution, said they were illegally docked over 5 percent of their roughly $10-per-day wage for any clothing item with a mistake. They also described physical harassment by factory managers and cameras monitoring workers even in bathrooms.\nAt Zongtex Garment Manufacturing in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, which makes clothes sold by the Army and Air Force, an audit conducted this year found nearly two dozen under-age workers, some as young as 15. Several of them described in interviews with The New York Times how they were instructed to hide from inspectors.\n\u201cSometimes people soil themselves at their sewing machines,\u201d one worker said, because of restrictions on bathroom breaks.\nFederal agencies rarely know what factories make their clothes, much less require audits of them, according to interviews with procurement officials and industry experts. The agencies, they added, exert less oversight of foreign suppliers than many retailers do. And there is no law prohibiting the federal government from buying clothes produced overseas under unsafe or abusive conditions.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t exist for the exact same reason that American consumers still buy from sweatshops,\u201d said Daniel Gordon, a former top federal procurement official who now works at George Washington University Law School. \u201cThe government cares most about getting the best price.\u201d\nFrank Benenati, a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget, which oversees much of federal procurement policy, said the administration has made progress in improving oversight, including an executive order last year tightening rules against federal suppliers using factories that rely on debt bondage or other forms of forced labor.\n\u201cThe administration is committed to ensuring that our government is doing business only with contractors who place a premium on integrity and good business ethics,\u201d he said.\nLabor and State Department officials have encouraged retailers to participate in strengthening rules on factory conditions in Bangladesh \u2014 home to one of the largest and most dangerous garment industries. But defense officials this month helped kill a legislative measure that would have required military stores, which last year made more than $485 million in profit, to comply with such rules because they said the $500,000 annual cost was too expensive.\nFederal spending on garments overseas does not reach that of Walmart, the world\u2019s biggest merchandiser, which spends more than $1 billion a year just in Bangladesh, or Zara, the Spanish apparel seller, but it still is in a top tier that includes H & M, the trendy fashion business based in Sweden, Eddie Bauer and Lands\u2019 End, sellers of outerwear and other clothing.\nLike most retail brands, American agencies typically do not order clothes directly from factories. They rely on contractors. This makes it challenging for agencies to track their global supply chain, with layers of middlemen, lax oversight by other governments, few of their own inspectors overseas and little means of policing factories that farm out work to other plants without the clients\u2019 knowledge. When retailers, labor groups or others inspect these factories, the audits often understate problems because managers regularly coach workers and doctor records.\nThe United States government, though, faces special pressures. Its record on garment contracting demonstrates the tensions between its low-bid procurement practices and high-road policy objectives on labor and human rights issues.\nThe Obama administration, for example, has favored free-trade agreements to spur development in poor countries by cultivating low-skill, low-overhead jobs like those in the cut-and-sew industry. The removal of trade barriers has also driven prices down by making it easier for retailers to decamp from one country to the next in the hunt for cheap labor. Most economists say that these savings have directly benefited consumers, including institutional buyers like the American government. But free-trade zones often lack effective methods for ensuring compliance with local labor laws, and sometimes accelerate a race to the bottom in terms of wages.\nUnsafe and Repressive\nAlong a dirt road in Gazipur, about 25 miles north of the Bangladeshi capital, riot police fired tear gas shells, rubber bullets and sound grenades in a fierce clash with garment workers last month, sending scores to the hospital. The protesters demanding better conditions included some from a factory called V & R Fashions. In July, auditors rated that factory as \u201cneeds improvement\u201d because workers\u2019 pay was illegally docked for minor infractions and the building was unsafe, illegally constructed and not intended for industrial use.\nLike dozens of other factories in the area, V & R makes clothes for the American government, which is constantly prowling for the best deals. In interviews, workers at a half-dozen of these suppliers described the effect of such cost pressures.\nAt Manta Apparels, for example, which makes uniforms for the General Services Administration, employees said beatings are common and fire exits are kept chained except when auditors visit. The local press has described Manta as one of the most repressive factories in the country. A top labor advocate, Aminul Islam, was organizing there in 2010 when he was first arrested by the police and tortured. In April 2012, he was found dead, a hole drilled below his right knee and his ankles crushed.\nSeveral miles from Manta, 40 women from another supplier, Coast to Coast, gathered late one night to avoid being seen publicly talking to a reporter. Dressed in burqas, the women said that prices of the clothing they make for sale on American military bases are now so cheap that managers try to save money by pushing them to speed up production. In the rush, workers routinely burn themselves with irons, they said, often requiring hospitalizations.\nWork does not stop, they said, when rain pours through a six-foot crack in the ceiling of the top floor of the factory \u2014 a repurposed apartment building with two extra floors added illegally to increase capacity. Even after the manager swipes their timecards, they say, he orders them to keep sewing.\nWhile giving a tour of the plant, the manager described the building crack as inconsequential and too expensive to repair. He denied the workers\u2019 other allegations. The owner of Manta declined to comment.\nConditions like those are possible partly because American government agencies usually do not know which factories supply their goods or are reluctant to reveal them. Soon after a fire killed at least 112 people at the Tazreen Fashions factory in Bangladesh in November 2012, several members of Congress asked various agencies for factory addresses. Of the seven agencies her office contacted, Representative Carolyn Maloney, Democrat of New York, said only the Department of the Interior turned over its list.\nOver the summer, military officials told Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, that order forms for apparel with Marine Corps logos had been discovered in Tazreen\u2019s charred remains but that the corps had ties to no other Bangladeshi factories. Several weeks later, the officials said they were mistaken and had discovered a half-dozen or so other factories producing unauthorized Marine Corps apparel. On Sunday, the owners of Tazreen and 11 employees were charged with culpable homicide.\nPresident Obama has long pushed for more transparency in procurement. As a senator, he sponsored legislation in 2006 creating the website USASpending.gov, which open-government advocates say has made it far easier to track federal contracting. However, procurement experts fault the website for requiring agencies to name their contractors, but not identifying the specific factories doing the work. Some states and cities already require companies to disclose that information before awarding them public contracts, said Bjorn Skorpen Claeson, senior policy analyst at the International Labor Rights Forum.\nFederal officials still have to navigate a tangle of rules. Defense officials, for instance, who spend roughly $2 billion annually on military uniforms, are required by a World War II-era rule called the Berry Amendment to have most of them made in the United States. In recent years, Congress has pressured defense officials to cut costs on uniforms. Increasingly, the department has turned to federal prisons, where wages are under $2 per hour. Federal inmates this year stitched more than $100 million worth of military uniforms.\nNo sooner had the Transportation Security Administration, or T.S.A., signed a $50 million contract in February for new uniforms for its 50,000 airport security agents and other workers, than the agency was attacked from all sides.\nUnion officials, opposed to outsourcing work overseas, objected because the Mexican plant making the clothing, VF Imagewear Matamoros, was the same one that had treated uniforms with chemicals that caused rashes in hundreds of T.S.A. agents. Congress called an oversight hearing, where some lawmakers questioned why two-thirds of the uniforms would be made in foreign factories, saying the deal was a missed chance to stimulate domestic job growth. Other lawmakers faulted the agency for spending too much money on clothing, especially on the cusp of a federal budget crisis, no matter where the merchandise was made.\n\u201cBottom line,\u201d John W. Halinski, T.S.A. deputy administrator, told Congress, \u201cwe go for the lowest-cost uniform, sir.\u201d\nThe hunt for lower costs and the expansion of free-trade pacts have meant that more of this work is being done abroad, often in poor countries where the Obama administration is trying to spur competition and development.\nIn Haiti, for instance, trucks loaded with camouflage pants, shirts and jackets, some of them destined for American military bases, idle in front of a factory called BKI.\nNext year, BKI managers hope to double the amount of camouflage clothing made for the American government, part of a contract worth more than $30 million between a division of Propper International, a Missouri-based uniform company, and the General Services Administration, which outfits workers for more than a dozen federal agencies.\nThree years ago, much of this camouflage clothing was made in Puerto Rico, where workers earned the minimum wage of about $7.25 an hour. By 2011, many of these jobs moved to a factory in the Dominican Republic called Suprema. Wages there were about 80 cents per hour and unpaid overtime was routine, according to workers in recent interviews and a 2010 audit. Since then, most of these jobs have migrated again, this time to BKI in a Haitian free-trade zone called Codevi. Average hourly wages at BKI are about 8 cents less per hour than those at Suprema, according to workers.\nStanding near the factory entrance, several BKI workers said they were proud of the clothes they made for the American government. \u201cWe push hard because we know they expect better,\u201d said Rodley Charles, 29, a quality inspector at the factory.\nBut there is basic math: the average pay of 72 cents per hour (which is illegal and below Haiti\u2019s minimum wage) barely covers food and rent, said Mr. Charles, who has since quit, and two other BKI workers.\nThese wage pressures may soon intensify. Codevi will soon face new competition from another industrial park called Caracol, which is being built partly with money from the United States Agency for International Development as part of reconstruction efforts after the earthquake of 2010.\nAmerican officials predict that Caracol will eventually create 60,000 new jobs. Current wages there? About 57 cents per hour, or roughly 15 cents less than typical wages at Codevi.\nBig Business\nAt a military store in Bethesda, Md., Tori Novo smiled as she looked over a pair of $19.99 children\u2019s cargo pants made in Bangladesh that sell for $39 in most department stores. The best part of living on base, said Ms. Novo, a 31-year-old Navy recruiter, was \u201csavings like these.\u201d\nKnown as exchanges, these big-box stores on military bases around the world offer a guarantee: to beat or match any price from rivals. That promise puts the exchanges in direct competition with the deep discounts offered by stores like Gap and Target. It also adds to already intense pressure to lower costs by using the cheapest factories, industry analysts say.\nThese stores, run by the Defense Department, do big business, selling more than $1 billion a year in apparel alone. Exempt from the Berry Amendment, the exchanges get more than 90 percent of their clothes from factories outside the United States, according to industry estimates. The profits from these tax-free stores mostly go toward entertainment services like golf courses, gyms and bowling alleys on bases.\nThough the Government Accountability Office criticized the exchanges over a decade ago for exerting less oversight than private retailers and for failing to independently monitor their overseas suppliers, little has improved.\nThe Marine Corps and Navy still do not require audits of these factories. The Air Force and Army exchanges do, but the audits can come from retailers, and defense officials fail to do routine spot checks to confirm their accuracy.\nFor example, Citadel Apparels, a factory in a seven-story building in Gazipur, has cut, stitched and shipped more than 11 metric tons of cotton boys\u2019 T-shirts and other clothes for sale at exchanges on Army and Air Force bases in recent months. This summer, lawmakers in Congress asked the Defense Department for proof that Citadel was safe. Defense officials produced an audit conducted for Walmart, another client of the factory, showing that it had an \u201corange\u201d risk ranking in July 2012, the same high level of alarm that Walmart had given the Tazreen factory before the fatal fire there last year.\nWhile allowing the factory to stay open, the audit offered an alarming statistical snapshot.\nSixty-five percent: number of workers barefoot, some on the building\u2019s roof. Fifty percent: workers without legally required masks to protect against cotton dust. Sixteen percent: workers missing time-sheets, a common sign of forced overtime. Most serious infractions: cracks in the walls that could compromise the building, and partly blocked exit routes and stairwells.\nBy January, Citadel\u2019s auditors concluded that most of these dangers had been fixed. However, a half-dozen Citadel workers offered a starkly different picture. Virtually none of the original problems had ever been corrected, they said in interviews last month with The Times.\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t sewing machines,\u201d one worker said. \u201cOur lives are worth more.\u201d\nFor now, Bangladesh\u2019s garment sector continues to grow, as do purchases from one of its bulk buyers. In the year since Tazreen burned down, American military stores have shipped even more clothes from Bangladesh.",

    "text": "The Bay of Bengal, in Peril From Climate Change\n2013-10-14T01:06:19.000Z\nLONDON \u2014 NEARLY one in four people on earth live in the countries that border the Bay of Bengal. The region is strategically vital to Asia\u2019s rising powers. Its low-lying littoral \u2014 including coastal regions of eastern India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia and Sumatra \u2014 is home to over half a billion people who are now acutely vulnerable to rising sea levels. Storms are a constant threat; over the weekend, a cyclone, Phailin, swept in from the bay to strike the coastal Indian state of Odisha, leading to the evacuation of some 800,000 people. \nThe bay was once a maritime highway between India and China, and then was shaped by monsoons and migration as European powers exploited the region for its coffee, tea and rubber. Today the bay is being reshaped again by the forces of population growth and climate change.\nThe scale and pace of these challenges demand urgent, regional cooperation. But first the countries that ring the bay must rise above their political fault lines and embrace the interconnectedness of their history. \nThe Bay of Bengal\u2019s coasts are under assault in every dimension: by water conflicts in the Himalayas and by drilling for oil and gas in the deep sea. The bay is a sink of pollution borne by the great rivers that spill into it, including the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Salween. Dam construction in China and India threatens downstream communities in India, Bangladesh and mainland Southeast Asia. With sea level rising and deltaic lands subsiding, saltwater intrusion onto farmlands has accelerated, with serious consequences for food production.\nThe bay\u2019s turbulent climate has played an outsize role in the region\u2019s history. Sailors crossed its waters from the earliest times; their trading routes linked India, China and Southeast Asia for centuries. The bay\u2019s natural bounty attracted the European powers in the early modern era, making it an arena for imperial competition and economic vitality. But the monsoons and their rainfall have always been volatile: periodic droughts and dangerous storms have posed a recurrent threat and shaped the region.\nIn the second half of the 19th century, land-hungry investors in an expanding British Empire created tighter connections across the bay. Migration reached huge proportions in the age of the steamship. More than 25 million people crossed the bay between the 1870s and the 1930s; most of them were young men from southern and eastern India destined for the tea estates of Sri Lanka, the rubber plantations of Malaysia and the docks and rice mills of Myanmar. Combined with the concurrent movement of Chinese to Southeast Asia, this was one of the world\u2019s great migrations, though much of it was circular rather than permanent.\nThis surge in migration coincided with two of the worst cases in a millennium of the failure of monsoons to bring needed rains. Especially intensive episodes of the phenomenon known as El Ni\u00f1o \u2014 the periodic warming of surface waters in the equatorial Pacific \u2014 brought drought to large sections of Asia in the 1870s and again in the 1890s. In India, millions died in the famines that ensued. Thousands sought survival overseas; many more moved locally. The people became more interdependent.\nOnly families with access to credit and wide enough social networks could take advantage of opportunities overseas. Colonial law distinguished between groups who could migrate and those who could not. For those who could not, the price of leaving was often the servitude of indentured labor across the bay. Poverty was as likely as sudden disaster to propel people\u2019s journeys. Once patterns of migration were established, they outlasted particular climatic or economic conditions. \nThe global economic depression of the 1930s, followed by the Second World War, stemmed migration and trade. After winning independence from colonial rule in the 1940s, Asia\u2019s new states policed their contested borders and controlled migration. Like many leaders of his generation, India\u2019s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, believed that modern science had \u201ccurbed to a large extent the tyranny and the vagaries of nature.\u201d \nBut the tyranny and the vagaries of nature were not so easily subdued, and they have taken a dangerous turn. Climate change inaugurates an unpredictable new phase in the life of the Bay of Bengal. Scientists predict a rise in the frequency and intensity of the bay\u2019s notorious cyclones. Over the past decade, more than 18 million people have been affected directly by tropical cyclones in Bangladesh, Myanmar and Thailand alone. \nAt the same time, socially if not politically, the bay today resembles the 1890s more than the 1950s. Intraregional migration has resumed. Coastal trade is booming. Old ports that had fallen into decline have seen a revival: Sittwe in Myanmar; Chittagong in Bangladesh; the coastal towns of Tamil Nadu, with long memories of commerce with Southeast Asia. \nThe bay\u2019s history shows that spiritual traditions, language and migrant routes are as likely to track the course of coastlines or rivers as they are to cling to national borders. Migration will continue to be a source of resilience in the region, offering a lifeline to groups that cannot rely on state protection. While much of the movement will be internal within countries, some people affected by rising waters will seek safety farther from home. \nIn doing so, they provoke an anxiety about borders that is a legacy of the bay\u2019s political history.\nWhere local people see a fluid frontier, state officials see firm lines on a map. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that since 2012, more than 13,000 people have tried to cross the Bay of Bengal in smugglers\u2019 boats destined for Malaysia and Thailand. Hundreds have died in the attempts; those who survive the journey face a harsh reception. Most of the refugees are Rohingya from coastal Myanmar, escaping a toxic mix of communal violence, political disenfranchisement and environmental threats. They are the most recent in a long line of people who have risked their lives to cross the bay. \nThe Bay of Bengal urgently needs more effective cooperation for environmental protection \u2014 for instance, by regulating fishing, protecting mangrove forests and curbing persistent pollutants and carbon dioxide emissions. More coordinated and humane policies on migration must also be developed. Hope for a new regionalism lies in recognizing that the bay\u2019s history, as much as its ecology, transcends national frontiers.",

    "text": "Deadly Collapse in Cambodia Renews Safety Concerns\n2013-05-16T09:34:53.000Z\nTREAM TBAL, Cambodia \u2014 Survivors described a scene of panic Thursday after a raised storage area collapsed at a footwear factory in this Cambodian village, killing at least two workers, injuring a dozen more and underlining global worries about factory safety in poor countries.\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember anything at all,\u201d said Hey Sokheng, a 19-year-old factory worker who looked dazed in her hospital bed in Phnom Penh, the capital. \u201cWhen I woke up, I was being dragged out of the rubble by someone.\u201d\nMultinational clothing retailers have been considering Cambodia as one of several countries that could be alternatives to Bangladesh for manufacturing after the disaster three weeks ago at a garment factory complex there that killed at least 1,127 people. The collapse and the grueling search for survivors prompted an international outcry for retailers to assume more responsibility for the safety of workers at their suppliers.\nThe accident at the sneaker factory in Tream Tbal, which is about an hour\u2019s drive southwest of Phnom Penh, is a reminder that workplace accidents and shoddy construction are not confined to Bangladesh, worker advocates say.\n\u201cThe shoe and garment industry is built upon huge profits and little concern for the well-being of their workers,\u201d said Tessel Pauli, a spokeswoman for the Clean Clothes Campaign, an anti-sweatshop group based in Amsterdam. \u201cIt is inherently unsafe and dangerous to work in. As long as workers are marginalized and deprived of their basic rights, the situation will not improve.\u201d\nA report by Better Factories Cambodia, a program of the International Labor Organization, highlighted concerns about workplace safety last month, including \u201ca worrying increase in fire safety violations.\u201d\nBradley Gordon, an American lawyer based in Phnom Penh, said that Cambodia had strong laws on safety and other issues, drafted partly with help from international advisers, but that enforcement was often weak.\nThe cause of the ceiling collapse Thursday was not immediately known. Ken Loo, the secretary general of the Garment Manufacturers Association in Cambodia, said that steel beams holding up a concrete-floored storage area at mezzanine height between two buildings had given way.\nOne of the workers injured in the collapse, Jonh Sokpheak, 29, said the mezzanine was \u201coverloaded\u201d with materials for sneakers.\nMr. Sokpheak said he avoided more serious injury because when the ceiling collapsed he fell under a table.\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been reincarnated; I didn\u2019t think I would survive,\u201d he said from his hospital bed. \u201cI crawled and crawled and then made it outside.\u201d\nOther workers described a frantic rush to safety. \n\u201cPeople were screaming, \u2018Get out! Get out!\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Thinna Makara, a 40-year-old woman who sews fabrics for sneakers.\nWorkers at the factory, called Wing Star Shoes, were making shoes for Asics, an athletic shoe company based in Kobe, Japan, said a company spokesman, Naomichi Hatori. He could not immediately say which market the shoes were shipped to, or whether the plant also made shoes for other brands.\nMr. Hatori said that Asics \u201coffered its deepest sympathies\u201d to the victims and their families and that the company would consider measures to revamp safety at its overseas suppliers.\nPopular with runners, Asics has been particularly successful in the United States, where it emphasizes corporate responsibility.\nThe factory, which opened about 18 months ago and was built on top of former rice paddies, employs about 8,000 people, workers say.\nEmployees have been asked to report to work on Monday, according to Komean Keang, a seamstress who on Thursday night was attending the wake of one of the workers killed, Ream Sa Roeun.\nMr. Sa Roeun\u2019s mother was inconsolable and had not eaten all day, family members said. She was given compensation of $5,000 by the company.\nEntry-level workers at the factory are paid around $75 a month, Cambodia\u2019s minimum wage.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough, especially when your children get sick,\u201d Ms. Makara, the seamstress, said. Workers have gone on strike three times since September, she said, and each time factory managers agreed to a monthly raise of $5.\nMs. Makara\u2019s sister, Melia, a forewoman at the factory, said seamstresses sew about 450 pairs of sneakers in a typical day, including overtime.\nMelia Makara, 26, said she was not afraid to return to work because the collapse occurred in a part of the factory far from where she works. Thursday\u2019s collapse was the first fatal accident she had witnessed in four years in the shoe industry, she said.\nUntil asked about it, Ms. Makara was not aware of the factory collapse in Bangladesh.\nSome workers said they were eager to return to work.\n\u201cRice farming cannot support my family,\u201d Mr. Sokpheak said. \u201cI want to go back to work at the factory.\u201d",

    "text": "Wal-Mart Hires Former Bush Aide as Chief Image Maker\n2013-05-22T20:46:31.000Z\nTo continue burnishing its image, Wal-Mart has replaced a former Clinton White House aide with a former Bush White House staff member.\nThe company, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, announced on Wednesday that Dan Bartlett, an adviser to President George W. Bush, would be its new executive vice president for corporate affairs, starting in late June.\nThe vague-sounding role in fact has a wide mandate, overseeing corporate communications, government relations, sustainability and the Wal-Mart Foundation. It is in essence Wal-Mart\u2019s chief image maker.\nMr. Bartlett replaces Leslie Dach, who announced his resignation in March. Mr. Dach, an ex-Clinton aide, helped create Wal-Mart\u2019s sustainability effort, its $4 generic drug program and its healthy food program after years in which Wal-Mart had been battered by politicians and the media. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened over the last several years, clearly here in the United States and around the world, it\u2019s become easier to site a Walmart and we have become more accepted by the community,\u201d Mr. Dach said last year, describing the effects of those programs on Wal-Mart\u2019s business.\nUnder President Bush, Mr. Bartlett oversaw the White House press office and was an adviser on his campaigns for governor and president. More recently, Mr. Bartlett was chief executive of the United States division of Hill & Knowlton Strategies, a communications firm.\nNicolle Wallace, a Republican strategist who was White House communications director under Mr. Bartlett, described him as \u201clow-key, very unflappable, he\u2019s the ultimate team player.\u201d\n\u201cHe was just really excited about being part of a company that, while it has an image and an identity as just a giant corporate leader, it\u2019s also very important in all the communities in which it exists,\u201d she said. At the White House, \u201che operated at that intersection of public policy and communication and really confidential counsel to the executives.\u201d\nWhile his work in the White House, obviously, focused on a Republican agenda, \u201cin the private sector he\u2019s given advice to people of all political persuasions,\u201d she said.\nToday, Wal-Mart is facing several reputational issues. It was linked to garments produced at the building in Bangladesh that collapsed last month, killing more than 1,100 workers. Wal-Mart has declined to join other large retailers like H&M in a pact to improve safety standards in Bangladesh, instead saying it would pursue its own safety program.\nWal-Mart is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department on potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and is also conducting an internal inquiry and compliance review. The New York Times reported last year that executives at the company\u2019s Mexican subsidiary had bribed officials to smooth expansion, and that executives at the company\u2019s headquarters had known about the bribes and declined to take action. In the most recent quarter, Wal-Mart spent $73 million on costs related to those reviews, much higher than the $40 million to $45 million it had expected to spend.\nAnd Wal-Mart has faced issues in its stores, including slower-than-expected sales, problems in keeping shelves stocked and complaints from unions about how it treats workers.",

    "text": "Vibrant Market Is Heart of Multiethnic Capital\n2013-08-12T03:38:31.000Z\nROME \u2014 On a sweltering recent morning here, customers from around the world crowded the aisles of the food market in Piazza Vittorio Emanuele near Rome\u2019s central train station, shopping for everything from plump Italian tomatoes and peaches to Thai basil, basmati rice and halal meat.\n\u201cCiao, capo!\u201d a South Asian vendor shouted to a colleague in colloquial Italian, meaning \u201cHey, boss.\u201d Nearby, two Indian nuns, wearing white robes lined with blue, inspected some produce. An African woman chatted on her cellphone, carrying a small child in a colorful sling on her back.\nOnce an average neighborhood market catering to middle-class Italians, the emporium at Piazza Vittorio, formally known as the New Esquiline Market,  has evolved into the heart of multiethnic Rome. In a country still grappling with immigration \u2014 in recent weeks, Italy\u2019s first black government minister has faced racist taunts \u2014 the market presents a different vision, one of an aging country\u2019s future as a land of immigrants, marked by an easier coexistence through commerce.\n\u201cThe market has changed a lot with immigration,\u201d said Fausto Bonanni, 64, who has worked at his family\u2019s organic vegetable stall for 40 years. \u201cFirst, it was internal immigration, immigrants from the south, from Calabria, Puglia and Sicily. Then Poles came under Wojtyla,\u201d he said, referring to Pope John Paul II.\nIn the 1990s, Bangladeshis, Indians and South Americans arrived, as well as immigrants from China. The neighborhood has become a hub of wholesalers of Chinese-made souvenirs sold in tourist shops across Rome.\nIn 2001, the market moved from the piazza to an indoor space and in recent years, many of the Italian vendors have sold or leased their stalls to new arrivals and retired on the proceeds. But not Mr. Bonanni.\n\u201cMy father left it to me, and I\u2019ll leave it to my son,\u201d he said as he stood in front of an array of fresh summer produce that the family grows in a plot on the Appian Way, in potassium-rich soil that brings out the flavor of the vegetables. \u201cI told my children, \u2018Keep this business alive because it is the only thing that will make you a living,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he added.\nThe variety offered in the stalls of the market reflects the changing face of Italy. There are Chinese dried mushrooms, odd warty gourds, lemongrass, chili peppers, yams and spices. South American stalls sell mango juice and Inca cola in Technicolor hues. A Polish butcher carries a variety of sausages. In one stall, an advertisement for Nestl\u00e9 powdered milk reads, \u201cRamadan Mubarak,\u201d or Happy Ramadan.\nThe immigrants \u201cwant to work and aren\u2019t afraid of doing jobs others don\u2019t want to do,\u201d Mr. Bonanni said.\nAcross the aisle, Boshir Odin, 29, from Bangladesh, said that he had been working at the market for a year, selling produce that he said was grown in Sicily or in Latina, near Rome. \u201cI speak a little bit of Italian, English, Bengali,\u201d he said with a grin, before imitating Chinese.\nThe number of foreign-born residents residing legally in Italy has tripled in the last decade, to about 4.3 million out of a population of 59 million. The largest groups are from Romania, Albania, Morocco and China, but other ethnicities are on the rise. The number of Bangladeshis in Italy has risen to more than 82,000 in 2011, the last year for which data was available, from 20,000 in 2003.\nItaly is still grappling with racism. Soccer players of African descent have been taunted during matches. Since taking office this spring, Italy\u2019s first black government minister, C\u00e9cile Kyenge, has had bananas thrown at her. Last month, a former government minister from the anti-immigrant Northern League Party, Roberto Calderoli, said that Ms. Kyenge reminded him of an orangutan and that she should go back to work \u201cin her country.\u201d\nMs. Kyenge, who was born in what is now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo, chose not to attend a gathering of the Northern League after its president, Roberto Maroni, who is also president of the Lombardy Region, did not publicly apologize for his colleague\u2019s remark. Prime Minister Enrico Letta denounced the remark, and another Northern League politician extended an olive branch, but the antagonism lingers.\nItaly has trailed France and Germany in terms of immigration and integration. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to quantify, but I think 20 years behind is a reasonable estimate,\u201d said Riccardo Staglian\u00f2, the author of \u201cThanks: Why We\u2019d Be Lost Without Immigrants,\u201d which argues that immigrants have become essential in Italy in fields as diverse as construction and health care for Italy\u2019s growing elderly population.\n\u201cBut in neither of those two countries would it be thinkable that an ex-minister says to a current minister what Calderoli said to Kyenge,\u201d he added of France and Germany.\nBack at the market, quality trumped politics. \u201cPiazza Vittorio has become Chinatown, but I don\u2019t care,\u201d said Isabella Fontana, 65, a retired nurse who was shopping for fish. \u201cIf the stuff is good, Chinese, Japanese, French,\u201d it doesn\u2019t matter, she said.\nMostafa Abdel-Wahab, 52, a halal butcher, explained that he had studied political science in his native Egypt but learned to be a butcher in Rome after he arrived in 1982. Eventually, he bought his own stall.\n\u201cWhen I came, there were dishes I missed and I couldn\u2019t find,\u201d Mr. Abdel-Wahab said, singling out the Arab pastry kunafa, a spindly nest of spun filaments and sugar. Now, it is easier, he added, slicing meat with a huge knife as he spoke.\nThe novelist Jhumpa Lahiri, who is living in Rome, recently wrote in the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that in contrast to the Italian-Americans that she grew up with in Rhode Island, who climbed the social and economic ladder, the Bangladeshis she met in Rome often had the opposite experience.\n\u201cThey say that they find it difficult to create a new life here,\u201d Ms. Lahiri wrote. \u201cEven if they have been here for many years, they still feel they are on the margins, barely tolerated, disconnected from the rest of society. Their children, born and raised in Italy, are not Italian citizens.\u201d Under Italian law, children born in the country have the citizenship of their parents.\nAnother vendor, Jane Eke, 48, from Nigeria, who was selling yams and bags of rice from a stall at the market, said that she was disheartened by Italy and had never felt accepted here. \u201cI don\u2019t like this country,\u201d she said, fetching a bag of rice for a customer from the Philippines. \u201cBut because of my kids, I can\u2019t go back.\u201d\nMs. Eke said her husband had come to study at an Italian university. He got the market stall 20 years ago and the family stayed, raising their three children here. Their youngest child, Ugo, 17, a cellphone earpiece tucked into one ear, was helping out. He speaks Italian, but not Ms. Eke\u2019s native Igbo language.\nTheir oldest daughter was graduating from college in Rome. \u201cBut after they study they don\u2019t have jobs,\u201d Ms. Eke said, referring to a youth unemployment crisis in Italy. A generation later, she is not so sure her children have a future in Italy. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to shift them toward the U.K.,\u201d she said.",

    "text": "4 Germs Cause Most of Infants\u2019 Severe Diarrhea\n2013-05-20T16:49:59.000Z\nJust four germs are responsible for most of the severe and fatal diarrhea among the world\u2019s infants, according to a large new study.\nDiarrhea is a major killer of children, with an estimated 800,000 deaths each year; it has many causes, and doctors want to focus on the most common ones to bring death rates down.\nThe study, financed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and published by The Lancet, found that the most common causes were rotavirus; a protozoan called Cryptosporidium; and two bacteria, Shigella and a toxin-producing strain of E. coli. In some areas, other pathogens, including the bacteria that causes cholera, were also important.\nThe study followed more than 9,000 children with diarrhea seen at clinics in Bangladesh, Gambia, India, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique and Pakistan, and, for comparison, more than 13,000 children without the disease. The children with diarrhea were more likely to have stunted growth and eight times as likely to die during a two-month follow-up period.\nDiarrhea seemed to be linked to chronic malnutrition, which causes gut inflammation that can make it harder to digest food.\nThe prominent role of Cryptosporidium came as a surprise to the authors; it had been best known as a killer of adults whose immune systems were suppressed by AIDS.\nIn an editorial accompanying the study, other experts said rotavirus vaccine could save many lives. The GAVI Alliance, which helps delivers vaccines to poor countries, recently included rotavirus in the vaccines it would buy at $2.50 per dose, and an Indian company said it would soon make a version that would cost $1. Zinc and oral rehydration packets continue to be important in treatment.\nSimilar large studies should be done to find the underlying causes of other common infections, the editorial said. An obvious candidate would be pneumonia, another major killer of infants that has many causes.",

    "text": "A Colorful Food Lover\u2019s Feast for the Eyes, Starring Flavors of the Bronx\n2013-11-01T01:39:17.000Z\nThe man in the purple suit knocked insistently until the metal door finally swung open on a recent afternoon. He bounded down the steps to a basement pool hall in the Bronx, where a worn lunch counter served some of the tastiest pork-and-okra stews and braised goat outside of the Dominican Republic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the real deal,\u201d said the man, Justin Fornal, who is known as the wacky culinary explorer Baron Ambrosia, as he dug into a plate of pan-fried sticky rice with his fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s Baron-approved.\u201d \nIf New York City\u2019s fine dining establishments live by Michelin stars and Zagat ratings, the myriad homegrown restaurants and shops of the Bronx have their own roving critic. Those that please the Baron\u2019s palate are recommended to his fans and featured in his ever-expanding portfolio of media projects, which includes podcasts and two culinary-themed shows on the Cooking Channel and BronxNet, a local cable television network. \nNow Mr. Fornal has cast some of his favorite Bronx places in a movie, \u201cBaron Ambrosia Is Dead,\u201d which will be shown free on Saturday at the Andrew Freedman Home, a landmark site on the Grand Concourse. The movie, which was produced by BronxNet and Sony Creative Software, sends the Baron on a madcap escapade through congestion-free streets and charming ethnic enclaves with cameos by his real-life friends, including the hip-hop musician known as Grandmaster Melle Mel.\nNotably, there is not one shot of a burning building \u2014 and, unlike that other movie about the Bronx, no Fort Apache-like police station under siege, either.\nMr. Fornal is not a Bronx native, but his homage to his adopted borough has won him a following among its 1.4 million residents. The borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr., proclaimed him the Bronx\u2019s official culinary ambassador, and a giant photo of the Baron was splashed across a billboard near the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge (formerly the Triborough) last year as part of an advertising campaign for his show on the Cooking Channel.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve adopted him, too,\u201d said Marlene Cintron, who oversees economic development for the borough. \u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful ambassador not just for Bronx food, but for the Bronx experience.\u201d\nStill, Ms. Cintron added, \u201cThe first time I saw him, I had to blink a couple times.\u201d\nMr. Fornal, 35, was a pop of color on a recent gray, overcast afternoon as he strode down the street in a vintage purple suit, an oversize bow tie with the Baron\u2019s initials, matching shoes and an umbrella. Purple was his color, he said, because \u201cit\u2019s the color of celestial funkiness.\u201d In the movie, he drives a purple convertible, which he built with his father.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an act, it\u2019s not a character, it\u2019s what I like to do every day,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many people settle for what\u2019s safe and what doesn\u2019t raise eyebrows. They\u2019re living at a fraction of what they could be. Every time I step out of the house, I want to live 110 percent.\u201d\nMr. Fornal, who grew up in Killingworth, Conn., followed his then-girlfriend \u2014 now wife \u2014 to her family\u2019s home in the Bronx in 1999 after studying filmmaking and history at the University of Pittsburgh. Soon he was exploring every corner of the Bronx, \u201cblown away,\u201d he said, by \u201cthe diversity and all the ethnic enclaves that were still intact instead of being homogenized and watered down.\u201d \nIn 2006, Mr. Fornal invented the Baron Ambrosia persona and started capturing his adventures in a series of podcasts called \u201cUnderbelly.\u201d Two years later, he developed and starred in \u201cBronx Flavor,\u201d a show on BronxNet, in which the Baron fought villains and ate his way across the borough. \u201cHe makes it kind of comical and then you actually learn about the Bronx,\u201d Melle Mel said.\nMichael Max Knobbe, executive director of BronxNet, described Mr. Fornal as a gifted storyteller who is helping to define the present-day Bronx rather than dwelling on stereotypes of the past. \u201cMany leaders and organizations have worked to make the Bronx a symbol of urban renewal,\u201d he said. \u201cBaron illuminates that, and is a champion of small businesses and people striving and thriving.\u201d\nFood often has a central role. Mr. Fornal, a self-taught cook, said he did not see himself as a chef or a food critic but as a culinary anthropologist. And, he said, \u201cobviously, I have a very ravenous appetite.\u201d\nMax Falkowitz, the New York editor at Serious Eats, a food blog and website, said that while he was not familiar with all of Mr. Fornal\u2019s culinary picks, some, like the Bangladeshi restaurant Neerob in Parkchester, were highly regarded. He praised Mr. Fornal for drawing attention to a borough that is not known for its food. \u201cThe Bronx needs someone who can get really excited about the quality of the food there and who can share it with others in an accessible and engaging way,\u201d Mr. Falkowitz said.\n\u201cBaron Ambrosia Is Dead,\u201d which was shot over the past few years, follows the Baron as he breaks out of jail (where he landed in the last episode of \u201cBronx Flavor\u201d) and returns to old haunts like the kitchen at Neerob, and Frank Bee, a family-owned costume store in Throgs Neck.\nMr. Fornal also took his film crew to Nano Billiard Cafe. Regulars playing billiards and dominoes were pressed into service for a fight scene. The cook behind the lunch counter, Anita Romero, 53, is shown mixing huge pots with a long wooden spoon.\nUnder Ms. Romero\u2019s watchful gaze recently, Mr. Fornal cleaned his plate, then he headed upstairs to hit the Bronx streets. \u201cA lot of people ask me if I was born in the Bronx,\u201d he said. \u201cMy reply is, \u2018No, I chose the Bronx.\u2019 I want people to come here and appreciate our community for what it is.\u201d",

    "text": "The Feminization of Farming\n2013-03-04T01:55:21.000Z\nLOUVAIN, Belgium\nACROSS the developing world, millions of people are migrating from farms to cities in search of work. The migrants are mostly men. As a result, women are increasingly on the front lines of the fight to sustain family farms. But pervasive discrimination, gender stereotypes and women\u2019s low social standing have frustrated these women\u2019s rise out of poverty and hunger.\nDiscrimination denies small-scale female farmers the same access men have to fertilizer, seeds, credit, membership in cooperatives and unions, and technical assistance. That deters potential productivity gains. But the biggest barriers don\u2019t even have to do with farming \u2014 and yet they have a huge impact on food security.\nAs sole or principal caregivers, women and girls often face a heavy burden of unremunerated household chores like cooking, cleaning, fetching water, collecting firewood and caring for the very young and the elderly. These uncompensated activities are equivalent to as much as 63 percent of gross domestic product in India and Tanzania. But they result in lost opportunities for women, who don\u2019t have the time to attend classes, travel to markets to sell produce or do other activities to improve their economic prospects.\nTo be sure, some female-headed farm households get remittances from absent men, but that is often not enough to compensate for the economic pressures they face. And we know that when women get more education and improve their social and economic standing, household spending on nutrition increases, child health outcomes improve and small farms become more productive.\nA 2000 study of developing countries by the International Food Policy Research Institute found that as much as 55 percent of the reduction in hunger from 1970 to 1995 could be attributed to improvements in women\u2019s status in society. Progress in women\u2019s education alone (which explained 43 percent of gains in food security) was nearly as significant as increased food availability (26 percent) and health advances (19 percent) put together.\nMany governments have recognized the causes of the poverty trap but have not done enough to remove the obstacles facing women. For example, several Asian countries have introduced stipends to keep girls in school, but many schools lack adequate sanitation facilities; there is a paucity of female teachers, which discourages socially conservative parents who do not want their daughters to be taught by men; and not enough is done to prevent farmers from pulling their children \u2014 girls first, usually \u2014 out of school to till the fields.\nCountries like Indonesia have introduced microfinance programs to help women pursue small-business ideas instead of housework. But creditworthy women are sometimes used as intermediaries to obtain loans for businesses run by their male relatives.\nIn a report to the United Nations Human Rights Council that is being released today, I urge a comprehensive, rights-based approach focused on removing legal discrimination and on improving public services \u2014 child care, water supplies, sanitation and energy sources \u2014 to reduce the burden on women who farm. But such an approach must also systematically challenge the traditional gender roles that burden women with household chores in the first place. \nIn Bangladesh, a program begun in 2002 by a nonprofit group, Building Resources Across Communities, shows how this might be achieved. It provided women with poultry (easier to raise than pigs, cows, goats and sheep); subsidized legal and health services; clean water and sanitary latrines, and a temporary daily stipend to tide over extremely poor women who were working as maids for extra income, so that they could focus on farming. The program also secured support from local elites, who among other things could help ensure that the women\u2019s children were enrolled in school. \nIn the Philippines, a conditional cash-transfer program, started in 2008, covers 3 million households. Aiming to improve women\u2019s access to obstetric care, and to improve spending on children\u2019s health and education, the program includes a \u201cgender action plan\u201d that requires that bank accounts be set up in women\u2019s names (which protects their control of the money and prevents fraud); trains women on their rights with respect to domestic violence, child care, nutrition and other areas; and trains fathers to share responsibility as caregivers. \nIn Yunnan Province in western China, women\u2019s groups were enlisted for a rural road-maintenance program in 2009. The participants, mostly drawn from ethnic minorities, received an average payment of $686 for an average of 110 workdays, allowing them to rise above poverty. The women were able to work while maintaining other income-generating activities like raising pigs or selling vegetables. They also got training to improve their agricultural productivity. \nRecognizing the burden that the feminization of global farming places on women requires us to overturn longstanding gender norms that have kept women down even as they feed more and more of the world. The most effective strategies to empower women who tend farm and family \u2014 and to alleviate hunger in the process \u2014 are to remove the obstacles that hinder them from taking charge of their lives.",

    "text": "Microcredit for Americans\n2013-10-29T00:03:54.000Z\nOn a recent Thursday, dozens of Latina immigrants clustered in a small, noisy second-floor office in the Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens, waiting for one of a half-dozen loan officers to call their names and hand over a check. Children loitered in the stairwell or sprawled, calflike, over their mothers\u2019 laps.\nThe loans were recorded the old-fashioned way, with ink, in green passbooks that enumerated the borrowers\u2019 commitments to \u201cexercise responsible financial behavior,\u201d \u201cseek preventative health care\u201d and meet each week in a \u201ccomfortable and safe place.\u201d Aside from these words, little secured the loans in question, which ranged from $1,500 to $8,000.\nThis form of microcredit \u2014 the smallest of small loans, with no collateral and few questions asked \u2014 was pioneered by Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and has long aimed to ease poverty in the world\u2019s developing countries, where rural villagers use it to buy livestock, repair motorcycles or otherwise increase their income. Since the financial crisis, microcredit has taken off in the United States, attracting thousands of clients who do not qualify for credit cards or traditional bank loans.\nThe purpose of the loans, as conceived by Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Prize-winning founder of Grameen Bank, is to help countless millions of poor people unlock their inner entrepreneur, to \u201cuse money to make money,\u201d as he put it in a telephone interview. But its newfound popularity may say more about the increasingly unstable nature of American poverty, in which credit is hard to come by and sustenance is cobbled together from part-time jobs and threatened by unpredictable expenses.\n\u201cFamilies in rural Africa are more like U.S. families than everyone wants to believe,\u201d said Jonathan J. Morduch, the executive director of the Financial Access Initiative at New York University, who has studied microcredit and is taking a close look at the financial lives of low- and moderate-income Americans. \u201cThe hidden inequality in America is about fundamental security, the ability to plan.\u201d\nIn the United States, microcredit has generally been defined as loans of less than $50,000 to people \u2014 mostly entrepreneurs \u2014 who cannot, for various reasons, borrow from a bank. Most nonprofit microlenders include services like financial literacy training and business plan consultations, which contribute to the expense of providing such loans but also, those groups say, to the success of their borrowers.\nGrameen America dispenses with the advice and makes smaller, less formal loans at a lower cost. It hews closely to the model developed in Bangladesh: borrowers form groups of five, approve one another\u2019s loans and make weekly payments at 15 percent annual interest, a rate comparable to those charged by other nonprofit lenders. That is far less than the rates of payday lenders, which can charge 400 percent or more.\nIf everyone in the group repays on time, each member is entitled to a larger loan in the next cycle. Members are supposed to be below the federal poverty line when they join and use the money for entrepreneurial purposes. Grameen does not ask if they are legal residents.\nThe organization\u2019s formula has proved popular. Microlending in general has boomed, more than tripling the number of borrowers from 2008 to 2011, according to data collected by the Aspen Institute and Grameen America. Grameen was founded in 2008 and has rapidly become a leader in the field. \nIt has 18,000 borrowers and as of last month lent more than $100 million. There are six Grameen branches in New York and five in other cities, including Los Angeles, Omaha and Charlotte, N.C. Most borrowers, Grameen reports, repay their debt and become repeat customers. Borrowers are also given savings accounts and encouraged to save at least $2 a week.\nBut, with more than 45 million Americans living below the poverty line, Grameen has barely scratched the surface of the problem. And it is difficult to tell how well the program is achieving its aim of lifting people into the middle class.\nIn Jackson Heights, borrowers said they used the money to buy costume jewelry, Herbalife nutritional supplements or Mary Kay cosmetics for resale in home-based businesses or door to door, many supplementing income from another job like housecleaning. Some make cakes or empanadas; others tailor clothing or sell flowers. One woman buys designer clothes at closeouts and resells them from a tiny shop on the second floor of a commercial complex; another sends clothes home to the Dominican Republic, where her sister sells them on the street.\nEven those with established storefronts have turned to Grameen. Guadalupe Perez, 51, took a loan when business fell off during the recession. She and her husband were having trouble paying rent on the party decoration store they had started with their life savings. \u201cIt opened up a way for me to keep my business,\u201d she said through an interpreter, standing near a display of ribbons and wine glasses that she had embellished with glittery designs. \u201cI wanted to hear what the rules were for Grameen because I was afraid of going to a bank. It was a loan that I could pay little by little; I felt it was a good choice for me.\u201d\nMs. Perez has used subsequent loans to expand the size of her store and now plans to invest in enough tablecloths to decorate two parties at the same time. But the loans have not increased her enthusiasm for entrepreneurship. Asked whether, had she the chance to do it over, she would go into business for herself, her answer was short and simple: no.\nMs. Perez said she and her husband worked every day and earned $500 to $600 a week, or about $29,000 a year \u2014 a \u201cvery low\u201d income by federal standards for New York. They are not able to save.\nGood data on the benefits of microcredit are scarce, and the few randomized studies have not demonstrated that it substantially improves prosperity in developing countries. In the United States, data collected by the Field program of the Aspen Institute show that microloans yield significant increases in income and create jobs. Joyce Klein, the program\u2019s director, said the surveys had limitations but more rigorous studies that included randomized control groups would be prohibitively expensive.\nGrameen says that its loan recipients have increased their incomes by an average of $2,500 during each six-month loan cycle, and that one in five hires an additional worker. But Katherine Rosenberg, a senior vice president at Grameen, acknowledged that pinning down income data is the group\u2019s biggest challenge, because borrowers tend to think in terms of whether they have enough to cover their next bill, not how much they make over all. Ms. Rosenberg said many clients may not earn more but instead work less, dropping one of several low-wage jobs or taking advantage of the flexibility of self-employment to spend more time with their children.\nElizabeth de Jesus, 45, is a hairdresser who, with Grameen\u2019s help, achieved her dream of opening her own salon in Corona, Queens. But she is unable to estimate her annual income. \u201cI don\u2019t know because I don\u2019t keep it,\u201d she said. \u201cI spend it all on the payments, on the rent, on food. I spend it every week.\u201d\nGrameen helps its clients in another way that many experts say is more important than increasing income \u2014 it establishes good credit scores. Many poverty alleviation groups have shifted their focus from saving to credit building, because people with poor or no credit must leave large deposits for basic needs like utilities, have trouble renting decent housing, pay much higher interest rates and have a harder time finding jobs.\nNayrobi Gonzalez de Quiroz, 26, recently received her first Grameen loan but decided not to follow through with her plan to buy handbags for resale. After using about $200 to pay off a debt, she said, she decided it was safer to leave the money in the bank and make the payments from her earnings as a manicurist.\n\u201cHere, you have to have good credit,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a young son and I have to think about his future.\u201d",

When the driver answered yes, Mr. Enright yelled Muslim-based insults and lunged through the partition with a knife, stabbing and slashing away. \nThe attack shocked New York, drawing condemnations from Muslim groups and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who invited the cabby to visit him in City Hall.\nFor Mr. Enright, the vicious assault left only the prospect of a nine-and-a-half-year prison sentence, which he accepted on Tuesday as he offered his apologies. \n\u201cI failed in every aspect of my life during the active days of my alcoholism,\u201d Mr. Enright, a former college film student, said. \u201cMost importantly, on Aug. 24, 2010, the date of my last drink, I failed as a human being when I attacked an innocent man in an alcoholic blackout and nearly took his life.\u201d\nMr. Enright, 24, hailed a taxi that night on East 24th Street. It was driven by Ahmed H. Sharif, who suffered stab and slash wounds to the throat, face, arms and hands.\nMr. Sharif did not come to State Supreme Court in Manhattan for Mr. Enright\u2019s sentencing, but an assistant district attorney read a statement from him saying that he and his family were still shocked by what had happened. Mr. Sharif, a father of four who came to the city from Bangladesh nearly 30 years ago, wrote that he had tried to return to taxi driving, but memories of the attack caused a high blood pressure condition.\n\u201cIt was the end of being a taxi driver in my life,\u201d Mr. Sharif said in the statement. \u201cAnd a lot of things happened that made my life very hard, all because of this.\u201d\nMr. Enright pleaded guilty two weeks ago to attempted murder and assault, both as hate crimes. His lawyer, Lawrence M. Fisher, said outside of court that his client had a history of alcoholism since childhood, and had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder from an attack he witnessed while in Afghanistan working on a film about the Marines stationed there. \nMr. Enright, wearing khaki pants and a green sweater, said the attack was a horrible way to \u201chit rock bottom.\u201d He thanked Justice Richard D. Carruthers for allowing him to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings while he was out on bail.\n\u201cMy name is Michael Enright, and I\u2019m a grateful alcoholic,\u201d he said.",

    "text": "Subcontractor Servitude\n2013-09-02T01:00:49.000Z\nTHE words \u201cguest workers\u201d and \u201cstrike\u201d are not often seen together. Yet twice this summer, members of a group of more than 150 Jamaican guest workers who clean luxury Florida hotels and condos walked off the job. The workers came to the United States in April anticipating a summer of hard work and decent earnings to send home. Instead, they encountered the black hole of labor subcontracting. \nLabor-recruitment firms brought the workers from Jamaica to the Florida Panhandle. Cleaning contractors hired them and then leased them out to scrub toilets and sweep sand from floors for vacation property companies. \nBy the time the workers first went on strike, in June, they had much to protest. They had borrowed to pay recruitment fees of $2,000 to $2,500, counting on promises of full-time work and good housing. But in Florida, the cleaning company packed as many as 15 people into unfurnished two-bedroom apartments, for which it collected as much as $5,000 a month. Charges for rent and required extras like $70 for a T-shirt \u201cuniform\u201d reduced the workers\u2019 net pay to subminimum levels, sometimes even zero, and \u2014 the final insult \u2014 paychecks repeatedly bounced. Children back home waited for money that never came. \nThose problems typify the debt, fraud and coercion that plague guest-work programs in the United States. An estimated 700,000 to a million guest workers and their families enter the country each year, mostly to work in low-wage industries but also as nurses, teachers, computer programmers and the like. When guest workers are exploited, it lowers the floor for American workers, too.\nH-2B visas, the class of visas held by the Jamaicans, are reserved for temporary or seasonal work for which there are not enough \u201cable, willing, qualified and available\u201d Americans \u2014 but of course, availability depends on the wages and working conditions on offer. Florida\u2019s unemployment rate has been stuck at over 7 percent, so it seems unlikely that no local cleaners could be found. \nGuest workers, however, offer something hiring a local worker does not: subservience. They are tied by law to the employer who sponsored their visas, which means that if they are found too \u201cdifficult\u201d for any reason \u2014 including asking that their rights be respected \u2014 the employer can effectively deport them and blacklist them from receiving future work visas. \nWhen the Jamaican cleaners struck the first time, protesting their stolen wages and miserable living conditions, the cleaning company stapled a notice to their paycheck stating that immigration authorities and local law enforcement would escort anyone who didn\u2019t return the next day to the airport, to fly home. \nThe Jamaicans\u2019 situation is part of a broader phenomenon of subcontracting. The structure of work has shifted since the 1980s, for workers from Manhattan office cleaners to Bangladeshi garment stitchers. The National Employment Law Project reports that 58 percent of jobs added during the recovery have been in low-wage sectors, which have high levels of contingent and subcontracted jobs. Today, almost all production in global manufacturing involves subcontracting. It is central to the structure of employment in the American construction, warehousing and agricultural industries as well.\nSubcontractors compete on the price of labor. Where production can\u2019t travel, they move workers across borders, with recruiters\u2019 help. They also shield businesses from legal liability for the treatment of workers and from labor-organizing efforts. Three steps are essential to curbing the system\u2019s worst abuses. \nFirst is immigration reform that protects all workers: When guest workers can defend their rights, the millions who labor alongside them benefit as well. Immigration law must be amended to forbid employers from charging guest workers exorbitant fees directly or through recruiters and to protect those who report abuses from retaliation. The bill passed by the Senate this summer is far from perfect, but it restricts what recruiters can charge and would allow guest workers and other immigrants in a serious labor dispute to change jobs and stay in the country. In contrast, the guest-worker bill House Republicans are threatening to introduce lacks those protective features entirely and would bring in many more workers, on much worse terms. \nA second necessary reform is legal responsibility along the contracting chain. If workers in a subcontracting chain are abused, the firms at the top of the chain that benefit from their labor should not be insulated from financial responsibility. An innovative California law penalizes a firm for its subcontractor\u2019s workplace violations if the firm did not pay the subcontractor enough for it to comply with all applicable labor laws. In Britain, the quaintly named Gangmasters Licensing Authority can penalize a firm in the food sector if its labor contractor violates the law. In the Philippines, recruiters are held responsible if they place a worker into a job abroad that violates national laws on overseas employment. Such joint liability should be the standard in subcontracting arrangements.\nThird is reform of labor laws. Before their second strike, on Aug. 17, the Jamaicans sought help from the National Guestworker Alliance (a nonprofit advocacy group, but not a union) and filed a complaint with the Labor Department. Other subcontracted workers are members of traditional unions, but the National Labor Relations Act restricts their ability to protest against the employer who actually holds the purse strings in a subcontracting chain, or to bargain collectively with that employer. It is time to repeal this damaging restriction. \nThis Labor Day, a group of courageous workers in Florida remind us that the right to fair working conditions is one that no company should be able to subcontract its way out of.

    "text": "A Catalog for All the World\u2019s Viruses?\n2013-09-05T12:00:06.000Z\nViruses have a knack for ambush. Time and again, they have struck our species without warning, producing new diseases. H.I.V. burst on the scene in the early 1980s, and it took years for scientists to figure out that it had evolved from a chimpanzee virus in the early 1900s. In 2003, a previously unknown bat virus in China began to cause SARS in humans. Today we are in the midst of yet another ambush, as a new virus called MERS is infecting people, mostly in in Saudi Arabia. Scientists have yet to definitively pin down its origin, although preliminary evidence points to another species of bat.\nWe might be able to take away this element of surprise if we had a catalog of all the viruses lurking in mammals. As soon as a mysterious epidemic broke out, scientists could turn to the catalog to figure out where the virus came from, potentially gaining some crucial clues to the virus\u2019s biology. But few scientists have ventured to build such a catalog, perhaps because there seemed to be such a vast number of viruses to contend with.\n\u201cNo one\u2019s really been addressing this question, even though it seems like such a fundamental one,\u201d said Simon J. Anthony, an associate research scientist at Columbia University and a researcher at EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based scientific research organization.\nIn a new study published in the journal mBio, Dr. Anthony and his colleagues have taken an initial step toward such a catalog by exhaustively searching for all the viruses that infect a single species of mammal \u2014 a bat known as the Indian Flying Fox. They found 55 viruses, 50 of which are new to science.\nThat\u2019s a lot of viruses, but Dr. Anthony and his colleagues argue that it nonetheless should be possible to make a catalog of most viruses in mammals for about $1.4 billion.\nIndian Flying Foxes carry Nipah virus, which has been causing human outbreaks since 1999. In recent years, researchers from EcoHealth Alliance have traveled across Bangladesh to survey the bat population for the virus.\nThe scientists ended up with a huge collection of samples from the animals \u2014 both throat swabs and urine samples from more than 1,000 bats. Dr. Anthony and his colleagues decided to take advantage of this rare opportunity and search the samples for every possible mammal virus.\n\u201cWe said, \u2018let\u2019s focus on the viruses and not the diseases,\u2019 \u201d said Dr. Anthony.\nTo carry out this search, the scientists developed probes that could latch onto genetic material from all known families of mammal viruses. They then used the probes to fish out virus genes from the samples, which they could then decipher.\nThe more bats the scientists studied, the more viruses they found \u2014 but only up to a point. By the time they were on their 500th bat, they tended to find viruses that were already on their list. And after 1,000 bats, adding a new virus to the list became a rare event. The fact that their search slowed down so much meant that there probably weren\u2019t a vast number of other viruses waiting to be found.\nTheir catalog of 55 viruses makes for a sobering read. The vast majority of them have gone unknown till now. And 10 of the viruses belong to the same family as Nipah. \u201cWe have no idea if any of them are any threat to human health,\u201d said Dr. Anthony.\nBut the study is also encouraging for scientists who would like a virus catalog. If the other 5,485 known species of mammals have a similar level of virus diversity, Dr. Anthony and his colleagues estimate that they would have at least 320,000 viruses in total. They believe it would only take about 500 animals per species to identify 85 percent of all mammal viruses.\n\u201cThis is a very impressive piece of work,\u201d said Linfa Wang of Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School in Singapore, who was not involved in the work.\nBut Dr. Wang and other experts cautioned that it is only a rough approximation of virus diversity in mammals. A search for viruses in saliva or urine may miss some species of viruses that lurk elsewhere, like in the spleen or kidneys.\nVincent Racaniello of Columbia University also pointed out that the presence of a short genetic fragment of a virus is not proof that it actively infects an animal. That sort of certainty would require finding evidence that the viruses are replicating. \u201cIn such a broad survey of viruses in a bat, it\u2019s very hard to obtain this evidence,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s also not clear whether the Indian Flying Fox is a typical mammal when it comes to virus diversity. \u201cThe headline number of at least 320,000 viruses to be discovered should be taken with caution,\u201d said Andrew Rambaut, of the University of Edinburgh.\nDr. Anthony agreed. \u201cThe number is almost certainly wrong,\u201d he said.\nTo move toward the true number, he and his colleagues are expanding their search, looking now at a species of monkey in Bangladesh and another bat species in Mexico.\nThey\u2019re also investigating whether any of the viruses they\u2019ve found in Indian Flying Foxes has already spilled over into humans without anyone noticing.\nBut Pablo R. Murcia of the University of Glasgow points out that a virus catalog would be useful for more than just medicine. Viruses from wild animals can also wipe out livestock, potentially endangering food supplies.\n\u201cThis adds another layer of potential burden that we need to keep in mind,\u201d said Dr. Murcia.",

    "text": "Inside the List\n2013-12-27T16:07:47.000Z\nBest of the Best: The Book Review has had its say; a few weeks ago, we named our 10 Best Books of 2013. But in the interests of inclusiveness \u2014 and, O.K., advance planning before the holidays \u2014 I wondered what our 10 best authors would pick as their favorites. So I asked them. The rules were simple: Tell us the best book you read this year (whether it was published in 2013 or not) and, briefly, describe it. Not everybody responded \u2014 I wasn\u2019t the only one beleaguered by sugarplums \u2014 but enough did to devote the column this week, and next, to their replies: the best books as chosen by the authors of the best books, a sort of chain letter of terrific reading ideas. Here they are.\nChimamanda Ngozi Adichie (author of \u201cAmericanah\u201d): \u201cI discovered Barbara Pym\u2019s \u2018A Glass of Blessings\u2019 this year and could not believe I had never read Pym. I loved it. It does that ancient, wonderful thing literature is supposed to do: instruct and delight. Pym is brilliant at portraying middle-class England in the 1950s, and even more so at honestly engaging with the \u2018psychology of femaleness.\u2019 It is a \u2018slice of life\u2019 sort of novel, serious without trying to be, very witty and very funny and very insightful, and it somehow manages to be both prim and subversive.\u201d\nPeter Baker (\u201cDays of Fire: Bush and Cheney in the White House\u201d): \u201cIn \u2018The Blood Telegram: Nixon, Kissinger, and a Forgotten Genocide,\u2019 Gary J. Bass takes us inside the Oval Office to reveal the scandalous role America played in the 1971 slaughter in what is now Bangladesh. Largely unknown here, the story combines the human tragedy of Darfur, the superpower geopolitics of the Cuban missile crisis and the illegal shenanigans of Iran-contra. Full disclosure: Bass is a friend. But you don\u2019t have to know him to appreciate this harrowing tale. It turns out there\u2019s still more to learn from those Nixon tapes.\u201d\nGeorge Saunders (\u201cTenth of December\u201d): \u201cI often assume earlier historical eras to be simpler than ours: cruder, slower, less morally responsive. A good antidote to this condescension is Edmund Wilson\u2019s brilliant \u2018Patriotic Gore,\u2019 on the literature of the Civil War. The book portrays an America every bit as 3-D and complex as our own but more articulate, that nevertheless proved incapable of steering itself away from slaughter. Even the introduction is impassioned and radical, with timeless zingers like: \u2018Whenever we engage in a war or move in on some other country, it is always to liberate somebody.\u2019 \u201d\nAlan S. Blinder (\u201cAfter the Music Stopped: The Financial Crisis, the Response, and the Work Ahead\u201d): \u201cAmerica is shamefully inadequate at teaching statistics. A student can travel from kindergarten to a Ph.D. without ever encountering the subject. Yet statistics are ubiquitous in life, and so should be statistical reasoning. So my hat\u2019s off to Nate Silver\u2019s \u2018The Signal and the Noise,\u2019 which uses spoonful-of-sugar vehicles like elections, weather, basketball and more \u2014 all washed down by highly readable prose \u2014 to make the lessons not only painless but fun. Quite an achievement.\u201d",

    "text": "Fast and Flawed Inspections of Factories Abroad\n2013-09-01T22:28:31.000Z\nInspectors came and went from a Walmart-certified factory in Guangdong Province in China, approving its production of more than $2 million in specialty items that would land on Walmart\u2019s shelves in time for Christmas.\nBut unknown to the inspectors, none of the playful items, including reindeer suits and Mrs. Claus dresses for dogs, that were supplied to Walmart had been manufactured at the factory. Instead, Chinese workers sewed the goods \u2014 which had been ordered by the Quaker Pet Group, a company based in New Jersey \u2014 at a rogue factory that had not gone through the certification process set by Walmart for labor, worker safety or quality, according to documents and interviews with officials involved.\nTo receive approval for shipment to Walmart, a Quaker subcontractor just moved the items over to the approved factory, where they were presented to inspectors as though they had been stitched together there and never left the premises.\nSoon after the merchandise reached Walmart stores, it began falling apart.\nFifteen hundred miles to the west, the Rosita Knitwear factory in northwestern Bangladesh \u2014 which made sweaters for companies across Europe \u2014 passed an inspection audit with high grades. A team of four monitors gave the factory hundreds of approving check marks. In all 12 major categories, including working hours, compensation, management practices and health and safety, the factory received the top grade of \u201cgood.\u201d \u201cWorking Conditions \u2014 No complaints from the workers,\u201d the auditors wrote.\nIn February 2012, 10 months after that inspection, Rosita\u2019s workers rampaged through the factory, vandalizing its machinery and accusing management of reneging on promised raises, bonuses and overtime pay. Some claimed that they had been sexually harassed or beaten by guards. Not a hint of those grievances was reported in the audit.\nAs Western companies overwhelmingly turn to low-wage countries far away from corporate headquarters to produce cheap apparel, electronics and other goods, factory inspections have become a vital link in the supply chain of overseas production. \nAn extensive examination by The New York Times reveals how the inspection system intended to protect workers and ensure manufacturing quality is riddled with flaws. The inspections are often so superficial that they omit the most fundamental workplace safeguards like fire escapes. And even when inspectors are tough, factory managers find ways to trick them and hide serious violations, like child labor or locked exit doors. Dangerous conditions cited in the audits frequently take months to correct, often with little enforcement or follow-through to guarantee compliance.\nDara O\u2019Rourke, a global supply chain expert at the University of California, Berkeley, said little had improved in 20 years of factory monitoring, especially with increased use of the cheaper \u201ccheck the box\u201d inspections at thousands of factories. \u201cThe auditors are put under greater pressure on speed, and they\u2019re not able to keep up with what\u2019s really going on in the apparel industry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see factories and brands passing audits but failing the factories\u2019 workers.\u201d\nStill, major companies including Walmart, Apple, Gap and Nike turn to monitoring not just to check that production is on time and of adequate quality, but also to project a corporate image that aims to assure consumers that they do not use Dickensian sweatshops. Moreover, Western companies now depend on inspectors to uncover hazardous work conditions, like faulty electrical wiring or blocked stairways, that have exposed some corporations to charges of irresponsibility and exploitation after factory disasters that killed hundreds of workers.\nThe Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh, which killed 1,129 workers in April, intensified international scrutiny on factory monitoring, and pressured the world\u2019s biggest retailers to sign on to agreements to tighten inspection standards and upgrade safety measures. While many groups consider the accords a significant advance, some longtime auditors and labor groups voice skepticism that inspection systems alone can ensure a safe workplace. After all, they say, the number of audits at Bangladesh factories has steadily increased as the country has become one of the world\u2019s largest garment exporters, and still 1,800 workers there have died in workplace disasters in the last 10 years.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been auditing factories in Bangladesh for 20 years, and I wonder: \u2018Why aren\u2019t these things changing? Why aren\u2019t things getting better?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Rachelle Jackson, the director of sustainability and innovation at Arche Advisors, a monitoring group based in California.\nEven with American and European companies appointing executives this summer to put in place a stricter regimen of inspections and safeguards under the new agreements, these efforts are limited to Bangladesh. Other leading garment-producing nations, like China, Honduras, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam, are not getting such stepped-up attention or expanded inspections. Thousands of factories in those countries will no doubt continue to be reviewed through the perfunctory \u201ccheck the box\u201d audits.\n Trouble With Audits \nFactory monitoring companies have established a booming business in the two decades since Gap, Nike, Walmart and others were tarnished by disclosures that their overseas factories employed underage workers and engaged in other abusive workplace practices. Each year, these monitoring companies assess more than 50,000 factories worldwide that employ millions of workers. Walmart alone commissioned more than 11,500 inspections last year. Spurred by heightened demand for monitoring, the share prices of three of the biggest publicly traded monitoring companies, SGS, Intertek and Bureau Veritas, have all increased about 50 percent from two years ago.\nThe inspections carry enormous weight with factory owners, who stand to win or lose millions of dollars in orders depending on their ratings. With stakes so high, factory managers have been known to try to trick or cheat the auditors. Bribery offers are not unheard-of. Often notified beforehand about an inspector\u2019s visit, factory managers will unlock fire exit doors, unblock cluttered stairwells or tell underage child laborers not to show up at work that week.\nUnauthorized subcontracting, or farming work out, to an unapproved factory (as was the case for the Quaker Pet Group order in China), is \u201cvery, very common,\u201d according to Gary Peck, founder and managing director of the S Group, a design and sourcing company based in Portland, Ore.\nThough almost all retailers prohibit the practice in their contracts, suppliers still do it to save money, speed production and meet high-volume orders.\nAnd even inspections conducted at authorized factories can be deeply flawed. When NTD Apparel, a contractor for Walmart that is based in Montreal, hired a firm to inspect the Tazreen factory in Bangladesh before 112 workers died in a fire in November, the monitors\u2019 questionnaire asked whether the factory had the proper number of fire extinguishers and smoke detectors on each floor. But it did not call for checking whether the factory had fire escapes or enclosed, fireproof stairways, which safety experts say could have saved lives.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a check-the-box inspection, you better have the right boxes to look at,\u201d said Daniel Viederman, chief executive of Verit\u00e9, a nonprofit monitoring group.\nSajeev Jesudas, president of UL Verification Services, which conducted the Tazreen audit, said inspecting for fire escapes and fireproof stairways was \u201cthe responsibility of the local building inspectors.\u201d Bangladesh has been faulted for having far too few officials to inspect factories.\nGreg Gardner, the chief executive of Arche Advisors, said Western retailers and brands often seek different levels of audits. Some, like Levi\u2019s and Patagonia, want rigorous \u2014 and costly \u2014 audits, while others prefer limited, inexpensive audits that will not jeopardize relationships with favored suppliers.\nAudits can be very brief. A single inspector might visit a 1,000-employee factory for six to eight hours to review all types of manufacturing issues, like wages, child labor or toxic chemicals. Some auditors receive only five days of training, whereas the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires three years of training and experience assisting inspectors before employees can lead an inspection of a sizable factory in the United States. \nIn the Rosita case, after the workers went on their rampage, the Western companies that bought the factory\u2019s knitwear grew alarmed. So Rosita\u2019s owner, South Ocean, a conglomerate based in Hong Kong, commissioned a new inspection.\nThat inspection, conducted by Verit\u00e9, which is based in Massachusetts, was a scathing broadside. Verit\u00e9\u2019s monitors found \u201congoing physical abuse\u201d and \u201cverbal and psychological harassment,\u201d with managers compelling workers who arrived late to stand for \u201cmany hours without rest.\u201d\nVerit\u00e9\u2019s three-day inspection found errors in calculating wages, chemical containers labeled only in English and unreasonably high production quotas for which workers were disciplined or fired for not meeting. The inspectors noted that workers \u201coften face harsh treatment,\u201d including jeering from managers if they requested sick leave or annual leave. The monitors also found that managers had fired employees for missing work because of a death in the family and that security guards had beaten workers involved in union and protest activities.\nMr. Viederman of Verit\u00e9 said the earlier inspection, performed by a major monitoring firm, SGS, demonstrated the shortcomings of checklist audits. The SGS inspection involved a one-day visit, largely seeking yes-no answers, probably for a modest fee.\nHe noted that SGS had interviewed employees only inside the factory, where workers were often unlikely to speak candidly, and not outside \u2014 for instance, at bus stops or at home, where workers might open up.\nCharles Kernaghan, executive director of the Institute for Global Labor and Human Rights, was shocked when he read the SGS inspection report for Rosita. \u201cThe auditors were saying everything was in perfect order,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shows how ineffective these monitoring organizations can be.\u201d\nEffie Marinos, sustainability manager at SGS, defended her company\u2019s findings. She said SGS had followed the inspection protocol developed by the Business Social Compliance Initiative, a factory certification group for European businesses.\nMs. Marinos said the protocol for Rosita did not require interviewing workers outside the factory, a practice that she cautioned could undermine a relationship between a Western company and its suppliers.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to start the whole approach with a lack of trust, that they are trying to fool you, that they are behaving unethically,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can sour an entire relationship.\u201d\n Bypassing Inspection Rules \nThe Walmart purchase orders read \u201cEthical Standards Required.\u201d\nIn mid-2011, the Quaker Pet Group, whose biggest customer was Walmart, began looking for cheaper factories where its trendy dog clothes could be made, according to a former Quaker employee who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal from Quaker. The company has also sold its goods to Petco, PetSmart and smaller retailers.\nQuaker settled on a plant called Jiutai Bag and Gift Factory in Dongguan, Guangdong. After visiting the site, Quaker\u2019s president, Neil Werde, sent a note to a Jiutai representative in June 2011. \u201cI was pleased with your factory,\u201d Mr. Werde wrote, according to an e-mail shared by the former employee. \u201cGood luck on the Walmart inspection.\u201d\nThat inspection did not occur. Quaker officials became concerned that Jiutai would not be able to pass an inspection, the former employee said.\nBut there was a workaround. While Jiutai would make the garments, Quaker would fill out order forms to say that the items had been made by Ease Clever Plastic Manufactory, then an approved Walmart supplier. Ease Clever is an established manufacturer that ships products to Target and other large companies, according to the global trade database Panjiva. Jiutai, by contrast, had only one recent listing in the database, for a small shipment to Puerto Rico in 2011.\nThe stickiest issue was how to get the clothing made by Jiutai past Walmart inspectors. An inspection at Ease Clever was scheduled for September 2011, when the Walmart representatives would check that the dog outfits were being manufactured there, the former employee said.\nJiutai simply took the clothes to Ease Clever, according to the former employee. Those moves were outlined in a later e-mail from a Jiutai representative to Mr. Werde.\n\u201cThe Walmart inspectors showed up and said, \u2018Oh, they are being made here.\u2019 It\u2019s not as challenging as you would think,\u201d the former employee said. \u201cYou have your finished-goods area and just show them the cartons being packed out.\u201d\nIn an e-mail to Mr. Werde, the Jiutai representative, identified as Mr. Hu, detailed how the setup had worked as he pushed Quaker for payment.\nIn July, Mr. Hu wrote, a company based in Hong Kong called KYCE, apparently acting as a liaison, helped arrange an order for the Christmas dog clothes. \u201cJiuTai only make the clothes,\u201d Mr. Hu wrote.\nIn September, \u201cwe hang the clothes\u201d in display cases and \u201csend to Ease Clever warehouse for Walmart during inspection,\u201d Mr. Hu added, including photographs of the costumes. After the inspection, the clothes went back to Jiutai, and Jiutai, after making final adjustments, packed and delivered the clothes to the shipping terminal, Mr. Hu wrote. Mr. Hu and KYCE representatives did not respond to multiple e-mails seeking comment.\nThroughout September, according to Walmart purchase orders, Quaker shipped $2.1 million worth of pet outfits from Yantian, China, to various American ports. The purchase orders list Mrs. Claus dresses, Santa suits and reindeer suits \u2014 the exact outfits Mr. Hu of Jiutai said he had made at his factory and then photographed. But the purchase orders list Ease Clever as the supplier, not Jiutai.\nContacted by telephone last month about the inspection and shipment, Jay Xie, a sales manager for Ease Clever, said the company had allowed the use of its Walmart certification. \u201cHis factory had not yet been audited \u2014 he used my factory because it was already audited,\u201d Mr. Xie said of the Jiutai factory manager. Mr. Xie said this had happened only once, as a friendly act to help a fellow manufacturer.\nThe shipment, though, was late, according to the former employee and Mr. Hu\u2019s e-mail. And soon after Walmart started selling these items, Quaker began receiving complaints, according to the former employee. When Walmart conducted a quality test on the Mrs. Claus dress, it found holes, and the outfit failed the test. Walmart executives then summoned Quaker employees to its sourcing office in Shanghai for an explanation, but Quaker did not disclose the subcontracting to Walmart at that time, the former employee said. \nIn March 2013, Walmart received a tip, via its global ethics hot line, about the unauthorized subcontracting and looked into it. \nKevin Gardner, a spokesman for the company, confirmed that subcontracting in this case occurred in 2011, and that Walmart officials \u201cmet with the supplier after the investigation to go through the findings and reinforce what our expectations are pursuant to subcontracting.\u201d\nEven though Walmart was alerted to the case nearly two years after the products were made and only after a hot line tip, the retailer pointed to the episode as an example of how its investigation and compliance system was working, not faltering.\n\u201cWe investigated. We talked with the supplier. We think this does show the processes were in place,\u201d Mr. Gardner said.\nIn January of this year, Walmart established a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, saying it would drop suppliers who used subcontractors without the company\u2019s approval. Walmart adopted the policy after garments headed to the company were found in the fire debris at Tazreen, an unauthorized factory.\nQuaker and Mr. Werde declined to comment. The pet specialty company remains a Walmart supplier, Mr. Gardner said.\n Cat-and-Mouse Games \nThe question-and-answer sheet that the factory\u2019s managers distributed to all their employees was explicit: if an inspector ever asked, \u201cAre there injury records?\u201d they were to answer, \u201cHave not heard of any work-related injuries.\u201d\nAnd if an inspector asked, \u201cAny corporal punishment in the factory?\u201d the employees were to reply, \u201cNo.\u201d If monitors inquired about underage workers at the plant, employees were coached to respond, \u201cEmployment for those less than 16 years old is prohibited.\u201d\nThis sheet, prepared by managers at a Chinese factory and obtained by The Times, had one purpose: to trick inspectors.\nSupply chain experts and monitors say that far too often, factory managers play cat-and-mouse games with inspectors because they are desperate to avoid a failing grade and the loss of a lucrative stream of orders.\nThe experts provided real-life examples. To avoid appearing illegally overcrowded, one factory moved many machines into trucks parked outside during an inspection, a monitor said. Whenever inspectors showed up at certain plants in China, the loudspeakers began playing a certain song to signal that underage workers should run out the back door, according to several monitors. During inspections in India, some factories displayed elaborate charts detailing health and safety procedures that, like stage props, were transferred from one factory to another, another monitor said.\nFor monitoring companies with major retailing clients, the auditing regimen can be nonstop. The territory itself is daunting \u2014 5,000 factories produce garments in Bangladesh alone. A retailer that uses 1,000 factories worldwide might want to pay no more than $1,000 an inspection \u2014 that could mean a one-day, check-the-box audit \u2014 instead of $5,000 for thorough, five-day inspections. That would cost $1 million instead of $5 million.\n\u201cYou have this intense price pressure downward on these inspection firms, turning them into a commodity business,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Rourke of the University of California, Berkeley.\nAuret van Heerden, president and chief executive of the Fair Labor Association, a nonprofit group that Apple uses to monitor its Foxconn factories in China, said many inspectors were too rushed. \u201cMany are doing a factory a day, and many auditors, more than one factory a day,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re on a plane and going to a new city the next day. They don\u2019t have much time to think about it or dwell on it.\u201d\nDespite some improvements, many supply chain experts say monitoring has inherent shortcomings. Not long ago, Nike and other sporting goods companies were shaken by revelations that children, ages 5 to 14, toiled up to 11 hours a day making soccer balls for them in Sialkot, Pakistan.\nA study found that half of Pakistan\u2019s soccer ball workers were making less than the minimum wage, with many stitching the balls\u2019 panels together at home, making it hard for factory monitors to unearth such violations.\nNike responded by requiring its main contractor there, Silver Star, to consolidate production in one big factory. Knowing how skilled many contractors have become at gaming the monitoring system, Nike took an unusual step and ordered Silver Star to set up a system of elected worker representatives who would be charged with speaking up about safety problems, wage violations or other issues.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned that monitoring alone isn\u2019t enough,\u201d said Greg Rossiter, Nike\u2019s chief spokesman.\nMr. van Heerden said, \u201cYou can never visit facilities often enough to make sure they stay compliant \u2014 you\u2019ll never have enough inspectors to do that. What really keeps factories compliant is when workers have a voice and they can speak out when something isn\u2019t right.\u201d\nStill, after a string of fatal disasters and repeated failures in uncovering serious violations, many experts doubt that even a highly organized and supervised inspection industry can improve factory conditions in country after country. Heather White, a research fellow at Harvard and a longtime factory auditor, said, \u201cIt starts as a dream, then it becomes an organization, and it finally ends up as a racket.\u201d",

Kennedy spoke of ending world hunger, yet on the eve of World Food Day, Oct. 16, the situation remains dire. The question \u201cHow will we feed the world?\u201d implies that we have no choice but to intensify industrial agriculture, with more high-tech seeds, chemicals and collateral damage. Yet there are other, better options.\nSomething approaching a billion people are hungry, a number that\u2019s been fairly stable for more than 50 years, although it has declined as a percentage of the total population.\n\u201cFeeding the world\u201d might as well be a marketing slogan for Big Ag, a euphemism for \u201cLet\u2019s ramp up sales,\u201d as if producing more cars would guarantee that everyone had one. But if it worked that way, surely the rate of hunger in the United States would not be the highest percentage of any developed nation, a rate closer to that of Indonesia than of Britain.\nThe world has long produced enough calories, around 2,700 per day per human, more than enough to meet the United Nations projection of a population of nine billion in 2050, up from the current seven billion. There are hungry people not because food is lacking, but because not all of those calories go to feed humans (a third go to feed animals, nearly 5 percent are used to produce biofuels, and as much as a third is wasted, all along the food chain).\nThe current system is neither environmentally nor economically sustainable, dependent as it is on fossil fuels and routinely resulting in environmental damage. It\u2019s geared to letting the half of the planet with money eat well while everyone else scrambles to eat as cheaply as possible.\nWhile a billion people are hungry, about three billion people are not eating well, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, if you count obese and overweight people alongside those with micronutrient deficiencies. Paradoxically, as increasing numbers of people can afford to eat well, food for the poor will become scarcer, because demand for animal products will surge, and they require more resources like grain to produce. A global population growth of less than 30 percent is projected to double the demand for animal products. But there is not the land, water or fertilizer \u2014 let alone the health care funding \u2014 for the world to consume Western levels of meat.\nIf we want to ensure that poor people eat and also do a better job than \u201cmodern\u201d farming does at preserving the earth\u2019s health and productivity, we must stop assuming that the industrial model of food production and its accompanying disease-producing diet is both inevitable and desirable. I have dozens of friends and colleagues who say things like, \u201cI hate industrial ag, but how will we feed the poor?\u201d\nLet\u2019s at last recognize that there are two food systems, one industrial and one of small landholders, or peasants if you prefer. The peasant system is not only here for good, it\u2019s arguably more efficient than the industrial model. According to the ETC Group, a research and advocacy organization based in Ottawa, the industrial food chain uses 70 percent of agricultural resources to provide 30 percent of the world\u2019s food, whereas what ETC calls \u201cthe peasant food web\u201d produces the remaining 70 percent using only 30 percent of the resources.\nYes, it is true that high-yielding varieties of any major commercial monoculture crop will produce more per acre than peasant-bred varieties of the same crop. But by diversifying crops, mixing plants and animals, planting trees \u2014 which provide not only fruit but shelter for birds, shade, fertility through nutrient recycling, and more \u2014 small landholders can produce more food (and more kinds of food) with fewer resources and lower transportation costs (which means a lower carbon footprint), while providing greater food security, maintaining greater biodiversity, and even better withstanding the effects of climate change. (Not only that: their techniques have been demonstrated to be effective on larger-scale farms, even in the Corn Belt of the United States.) And all of this without the level of subsidies and other support that industrial agriculture has received in the last half-century, and despite the efforts of Big Ag to become even more dominant.\nIn fact if you define \u201cproductivity\u201d not as pounds per acre but as the number of people fed per that same area, you find that the United States ranks behind both China and India (and indeed the world average), and roughly the same as Bangladesh, because so much of what we grow goes to animals and biofuels. (Regardless of how food is produced, delivered and consumed, waste remains at about one third.) Thus, as the ETC\u2019s research director, Kathy Jo Wetter, says, \u201cIt would be lunacy to hold that the current production paradigm based on multinational agribusiness is the only credible starting point for achieving food security.\u201d This is especially true given all of its downsides.\nAs Raj Patel, a fellow at the Institute for Food and Development Policy, puts it, \u201cThe playing field has been tilted against peasants for centuries, and they\u2019ve still managed to feed more people than industrial agriculture. With the right kinds of agroecological training and the freedom to shape the food system on fair terms, it\u2019s a safe bet that they\u2019ll be able to feed themselves, and others as well.\u201d\nYet obviously not all poor people feed themselves well, because they lack the essentials: land, water, energy and nutrients. Often that\u2019s a result of cruel dictatorship (North Korea) or war, displacement and strife (the Horn of Africa, Haiti and many other places), or drought or other calamities. But it can also be an intentional and direct result of land and food speculation and land and water grabs, which make it impossible for peasants to remain in their home villages. (Governments of many developing countries may also act as agents for industrial agriculture, seeing peasant farming as \u201cinefficient.\u201d)\nThe result is forced flight to cities, where peasants become poorly paid laborers, enter the cash market for (increasingly mass produced) food, and eat worse. (They\u2019re no longer \u201cpeasants,\u201d at this point, but more akin to the working poor of the United States, who also often cannot afford to eat well, though not to the point of starvation.) It\u2019s a formula for making not only hunger but obesity: remove the ability to produce food, then remove the ability to pay for food, or replace it with only one choice: bad food.\nIt\u2019s not news that the poor need money and justice. If there\u2019s a bright side here, it\u2019s that the changes required to \u201cfix\u201d the problems created by \u201cindustrial agriculture\u201d are perhaps more tractable than those created by inequality.\nWe might begin by ditching the narrow focus on yields (as Jonathan Foley, director of the Institute on the Environment at the University of Minnesota, says, \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018grow baby grow\u2019 \u201d), which seem to be ebbing naturally as land quality deteriorates and chemicals become less effective (despite high-tech \u201cadvances\u201d like genetically engineered crops). Better, it would seem, would be to ask not how much food is produced, but how it\u2019s produced, for whom, at what price, cost and benefit.\nWe also need to see more investment in researching the benefits of traditional farming. Even though simple techniques like those mentioned above give measurably excellent results, because they\u2019re traditional \u2014 even ancient \u2014 \u201ctechnologies,\u201d and because their benefits in profiting multinationals or international trade are limited, they\u2019ve never received investment on the same scale as corporate agriculture. (It\u2019s impossible not to point out here that a similar situation exists between highly subsidized and damaging fossil fuels and oft-ignored yet environmentally friendly renewables.)\nInstead, the money and energy (of all kinds) focused on boosting supply cannot be overstated. If equal resources were put into reducing waste \u2014 which aside from its obvious merits would vastly prevent the corresponding greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 questioning the value of animal products, reducing overconsumption (where \u201cwaste\u201d becomes \u201cwaist\u201d), actively promoting saner, less energy-consuming alternatives, and granting that peasants have the right to farm their traditional landholdings, we could not only ensure that people could feed themselves but also reduce agriculture\u2019s contribution to greenhouse gases, chronic disease and energy depletion.\nThis isn\u2019t about \u201corganic\u201d versus \u201cmodern.\u201d It\u2019s about supporting the system in which small producers make decisions based on their knowledge and experience of their farms in the landscape, as opposed to buying standardized technological fixes in a bag. Some people call this knowledge-based rather than energy-based agriculture, but obviously it takes plenty of energy; as it happens, much of that energy is human, which can be a good thing. Frances Moore Lapp\u00e9, author of \u201cDiet for a Small Planet,\u201d calls it \u201crelational,\u201d and says, \u201cAgroecology is not just healthy sustainable food production but the seed of a different way of relating to one another, and to the earth.\u201d\nThat may sound new age-y, but so be it; all kinds of questions and all kinds of theories are needed if we\u2019re going to produce food sustainably. Supporting, or at least not obstructing, peasant farming is one key factor, but the other is reining in Western-style monoculture and the standard American diet it creates.\nSome experts are at least marginally optimistic about the second half of this: \u201cThe trick is to find the sweet spot,\u201d says Mr. Foley of the University of Minnesota, \u201cbetween better nutrition and eating too much meat and junk. The optimistic view is to hope that the conversation about what\u2019s wrong with our diet may deflect some of this. Eating more meat is voluntary, and how the Chinese middle class winds up eating will determine a great deal.\u201d Of course, at the moment, that middle class shows every indication that it\u2019s moving in the wrong direction; China is the world\u2019s leading consumer of meat, a trend that isn\u2019t slowing.\nBut if the standard American diet represents the low point of eating, a question is whether the developing world, as it hurtles toward that nutritional nadir \u2014 the polar opposite of hunger, but almost as deadly \u2014 can see its destructive nature and pull out of the dive before its diet crashes. Because \u201csolving\u201d hunger by driving people into cities to take low-paying jobs so they can buy burgers and fries is hardly a desirable outcome.\n Mark Bittman is a food journalist, author and contributing opinion writer for The New York Times.

    "text": "U.S. Pushes for Global Eye on South Sudan Conflict\n2013-07-29T14:26:19.000Z\nWASHINGTON \u2014 When the National Security Council, the most buttoned-up part of a buttoned-up Obama administration, is aggressively trying to get the word out about a violent, murky conflict in a distant land, it\u2019s worth listening to. It\u2019s also worth asking, why single out this crisis? \nSuch is the case with the ethnic and tribal clashes that are rippling through a remote, sprawling part of South Sudan known as Jonglei State. Administration officials say they are deeply concerned about the violence, all the more so because there is so little reliable information coming out of a region that is inaccessible in the best of times.\nRather than monitor events quietly from their offices in the Old Executive Office Building, as they do with more widely publicized conflicts like the one in Syria, senior N.S.C. officials have invited in humanitarian and advocacy groups for briefings. They have written blog items. And they have discussed their fears with American and foreign journalists.\n\u201cMore than 100,000 people have been displaced,\u201d said Grant T. Harris, senior director for African Affairs at the council. \u201cThe international community doesn\u2019t know where these people are.\u201d\nOfficials describe a desperate situation in which tens of thousands of people are hiding in swamps, without food, water or medicine \u2014 fearful of returning to their villages because of attacks by rival tribes or even soldiers who are supposed to be protecting them.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got all the ingredients for a conflict that could get much worse very quickly,\u201d said Gayle Smith, the senior director for global development and humanitarian issues at the N.S.C.\nTheir immediate goal, officials say, is to put an obscure conflict on the world\u2019s radar screen before it mutates into a humanitarian tragedy. But they are also working to preserve one of the Obama administration\u2019s few undisputed achievements in Africa: the 2011 referendum that split South Sudan off from Sudan and created a new nation.\nThe violence in Jonglei, South Sudan\u2019s largest and most populous state, threatens to destabilize the country and tatter the credibility of its fledgling, American-backed government. \nIn addition to the perennial feuding between two tribes, the Lou Nuer and the Murle, there are reports of attacks on civilians by troops from the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army, which began as a guerrilla force fighting for South Sudan\u2019s independence and is now the country\u2019s army.\nJonglei, Ms. Smith said, \u201chas all the characteristics of the rest of South Sudan. The problem now is you have tribal tension, a lot of history of bad blood, and a rebellion on top of it.\u201d\nThe United States and other Western nations have poured billions of dollars into South Sudan, before and after the referendum, to try to turn a destitute land, with oil reserves but a long history of violence and little in the way of institutions, into a viable country.\nThe administration has strongly supported the South Sudan government, which is led by Salva Kiir, a leader of the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army. But now President Kiir is himself a problem: last week, he dismissed his vice president, who had threatened to challenge him for his party\u2019s leadership before elections in 2015, and his entire cabinet.\nOn Friday, Secretary of State John Kerry telephoned Mr. Kiir to deliver what amounted to a rap on the knuckles. He warned the president that he should form a new government quickly, stop the ethnic clashes in Jonglei and crack down on soldiers in the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army who are found guilty of human rights abuses.\nNoting that he had traveled to Sudan to witness the referendum, Mr. Kerry said in a statement: \u201cToo much sacrifice has been made to see that effort go backward. The world is watching to see if South Sudan pursues the path of peace and prosperity, or the tragic path of violence and conflict that has characterized much of its past.\u201d\nThe National Security Council has held regular deputy-level meetings to determine how the United States should respond, both to the escalating violence in Jonglei and the governance problems. President Obama, they said, has been briefed about the crisis.\nIn the short term, officials are focused on trying to get relief supplies to the displaced people. Jonglei, which is the size of Bangladesh, has few roads and those are impassable after heavy rains. That means emergency aid must be airlifted into the region. The United Nations\u2019 World Food Program is seeking $20 million to lease helicopters.\nAnother major obstacle is that United Nations peacekeepers in South Sudan are reluctant to go to Jonglei because in April, five United Nations employees and five Indian peacekeepers were killed there in an ambush by armed men the South Sudanese described as antigovernment rebels. Five months before that, the South Sudanese military shot down a United Nations helicopter \u2014 by accident, according to local officials.\nAs a big provider of financial assistance, the United States has considerable leverage over the South Sudanese government. It also has sway over how the World Bank and International Monetary Fund treat the country. But having labored for years to nurture democracy in South Sudan, the White House is loath to turn against it.\n\u201cThey\u2019re very worried that they\u2019re going to have to do a major policy shift,\u201d said Sarah Margon, the acting Washington director of Human Rights Watch. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to figure out how to balance a very tricky situation in a way that doesn\u2019t end up being a major fail for them.\u201d",

    "text": "Living Through Terror, in Rawalpindi and Boston\n2013-04-16T15:17:07.000Z\nBOSTON\nI WAS in the middle of having Chinese food with my wife and friends yesterday afternoon when we heard the dull and deathly reverb. The water in our plastic cups rippled. We looked at one another, and someone made a joke about that famous scene in \u201cJurassic Park.\u201d We tried to drown the moment in humor. But then a rush of humanity descended upon us in the Prudential Center on Boylston Street, right across from where the second bomb blast had just occurred, near the marathon\u2019s finish line. \nPeople gushed across the hallway like fish in white water rapids. It was a blur of bright clothes and shiny sneakers, everyone dressed up for Patriot\u2019s Day weekend on what was moments ago a beautiful spring day. Instantly, images of the shootings in Aurora, Colo., Newtown, Conn., and Tucson came to mind. I felt my thoughts reduced to singular flashes. My life, all of it, was the first. My wife, sitting across me, was the second. I yelled out to her to run, and we did, not knowing what had happened, only that it had to be something terrible. \nWe ran out of the food court and onto the terrace overlooking Boylston Street. We could see people fleeing from the finish line even as, in the distance, other weary marathoners kept running unknowingly toward the devastation. What was left of the food court was a land frozen in an innocent time, forks still stuck in half-eaten pieces of steak, belongings littered unattended. I felt fear beyond words. \nThis was not my first experience with terror, having grown up in Pakistan. But for some reason, I didn\u2019t think back to those experiences. Looking onto to the smoked, chaotic Boylston Street, I forgot about cowering in my childhood bedroom as bombs and gunfire rained over the army headquarters in Rawalpindi, close to our house. My mind did not go back to when I stood on the roof of my dormitory in Karachi as the streets were overrun with burning buses and angry protesters after the assassination of Benazir Bhutto. None of the unfortunate experiences of growing up in the midst of thousands of victims of terror, personally knowing some of them, helped me in that moment. Nothing made it any easier. \nPerhaps, if I had been thinking more clearly and hadn\u2019t had my wife with me, I might have gone down to try to help the wounded. But at that moment all I could think about was getting us out of there. We lost our friends, then found them again. Our cellphones weren\u2019t working. And then, as we worked our way through the dazed throngs in Back Bay, I realized that not only was I a victim of terror, but I was also a potential suspect. \nAs a 20-something Pakistani male with dark stubble (an ode more to my hectic schedule as a resident in the intensive-care unit than to any aesthetic or ideology), would I not fit the bill? I know I look like Hollywood\u2019s favorite post-cold-war movie villain. I\u2019ve had plenty of experience getting intimately frisked at airports. Was it advisable to go back to pick up my friend\u2019s camera that he had forgotten in his child\u2019s stroller in the mall? I remember feeling grateful that I wasn\u2019t wearing a backpack, which I imagined might look suspicious. My mind wandered to when I would be working in the intensive care unit the next day, possibly taking care of victims of the blast. What would I tell them when they asked where I was from (a question I am often posed)? Wouldn\u2019t it be easier to just tell people I was from India or Bangladesh? \nAs I walked down Commonwealth Avenue, I started receiving calls from family back home. They informed me about what was unfolding on television screens across the world. I was acutely conscious of what I spoke over the phone, feeling that someone was breathing over my shoulder, listening to every word I said. Careful to avoid Urdu, speaking exclusively in English, I relayed that I was safe, and all that I had seen. I continued to na\u00efvely cling to the hope that it was a gas explosion, a subway accident, anything other than what it increasingly seemed to be: an act of brutality targeted at the highest density of both people and cameras. \nThe next step was to hope that the perpetrator was not a lunatic who would become the new face of a billion people. Not a murderer who would further fan the flames of Islamophobia. Not an animal who would obstruct the ability of thousands of students to complete their educations in the United States. Not an extremist who would maim and hurt the very people who were still recovering from the pain of Sept. 11. President Obama and Gov. Deval L. Patrick have shown great restraint in their words and have been careful not to accuse an entire people for what one madman may have done. But others might not be so kind.",

    "text": "In Myanmar, Flirtations by Investors Turn Into Commitments\n2013-06-07T16:52:23.000Z\nNAYPYIDAW, Myanmar \u2014 Foreign executives who flew into this dirt-poor country over the past year to tap into what is described as Asia\u2019s last major frontier market often came away skeptical, befuddled or outright disappointed.\n\u201cLook, listen, learn \u2014 and leave\u201d was the catch phrase that described trips here by executives who saw first-hand the lack of electricity, terrible roads, eager but very undereducated work force and overwhelmed government officials.\nNow, two years after Myanmar\u2019s civilian government came to power, the country appears to be moving into another stretch of its journey from military dictatorship to democratic market economy. Flirtations by foreign investors are turning into commitments, vague promises into dollars.\nSome of the world\u2019s most prominent multinational companies \u2014 Coca-Cola, Unilever, General Electric, Philips, Visa \u2014 have started doing business in the country.\n\u201cWe\u2019re prepared to be very patient,\u201d said John G. Rice, a vice chairman of General Electric, who attended a World Economic Forum conference of foreign executives in Naypyidaw that concluded Friday. G.E. has leased aircraft and sold medical machinery and turbines in Myanmar in recent months and announced it would donate $7 million worth of training to engineers and health care workers.\nThe overall scale of the company\u2019s investment remains small. G.E. opened an office earlier this year with considerable fanfare but it has only two employees in the country.\n\u201cThe world is getting used to the fact that Myanmar is no Shangri-La,\u201d said Peter Maher, the head of Southeast Asian operations for Visa. \u201cThis is frontier stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cWe take it on faith that there will be a market here.\u201d\nSince December, when automatic teller machines were reintroduced into the country, the number of A.T.M.'s accepting international credit cards has gone from zero to 160 and spending by foreign cardholders in the country has totaled about $7 million. But as a measure of the still tiny size of the market here, in neighboring Thailand, which has a similar population but a much more developed economy, foreign cardholders spent 400 times as much during the same time period \u2014 about $3 billion, Mr. Maher said.\nCompanies from China and other Asian countries have long had a strong presence in Myanmar, but with the lifting or suspension of European and American sanctions, Myanmar is increasingly turning to the West for assistance in building a country that was impoverished by five decades of military rule.\nOne of the biggest tests of the country\u2019s ability to attract investors is the auction for mobile phone licenses scheduled to be completed later this month. Fewer than 10 percent of the people in Myanmar have mobile phones, compared with 80 percent in neighboring Bangladesh.\nJaspal Bindra, the group executive director of Standard Chartered Bank, said the winners of the mobile phone licenses would need to invest billions of dollars.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where you will see investment dollars quicker than later,\u201d he said.\nCompanies selling food and other consumer goods are also moving quickly. For decades, packaged food and drinks have been imported \u2014 and smuggled \u2014 into the country from Thailand and China; companies are now seeking to move production here.\nDaniel Sjogren, managing director of Carlsberg Myanmar, is presiding over the construction of a brewery in Bago, a city an hour and a half outside the country\u2019s commercial capital, Yangon.\nWith annual consumption of beer in Myanmar about five liters, or little more than one gallon, per person, compared with 20 liters per person in a more developed territory like Hong Kong, the brewer anticipates years of growth.\nBut Carlsberg\u2019s investment plans also underline some of the challenges foreign companies face in setting up operations. Yangon, where Mr. Sjogren is moving with his family, is strained by the influx of foreigners. He had difficulty getting his two young children enrolled in an international school and the house he has rented in Yangon is only marginally less expensive than the apartment he is leaving in Hong Kong, one of the world\u2019s most expensive cities.\n\u201cIf you want a decent house in an area of Yangon with secure electricity, you\u2019re talking $10,000 a month,\u201d he said.\nElectricity supply is also an issue at the planned brewery in Bago \u2014 the company must install its own electricity supply.\nU Soe Thane, a minister and key aide to President Thein Sein, does not hesitate when asked the most frequent complaint by foreign investors: \u201cElectricity,\u201d he replies. Only 13 percent of households have access to electricity, according to a report released earlier this month by McKinsey, the international consulting firm.\n\u201cWithout electricity it\u2019s just talk,\u201d said Mr. Rice of G.E. \u201cJust about everything you do requires a plug.\u201d",

    "text": "In the War on Poverty, a Dogged Adversary\n2013-12-17T23:46:18.000Z\nWhen President Lyndon Johnson declared his war on poverty on Jan. 8, 1964, almost exactly 50 years ago, 19 percent of Americans were poor.\n\u201cThe richest nation on earth can afford to win it,\u201d he reasoned, as he proposed a clutch of initiatives from expanding food stamps to revamping unemployment insurance. \u201cWe cannot afford to lose it.\u201d\nA half-century later, our priorities have changed.\nIn November, food benefits were cut for approximately 48 million Americans by an average of 7 percent, costing the typical recipient about $9 a month, as the emergency expansion of the food stamp program enacted in the depths of the great recession was allowed to expire.\nNext month, 1.3 million jobless workers are scheduled to stop receiving an unemployment check, after Congress\u2019s refusal to prolong the extension of emergency jobless benefits to up to 73 weeks, from 26. Perhaps as many as five million people will lose their benefit over the next year.\nBut while politicians\u2019 attention has wandered, poverty remains uncomfortably close to where it was five decades ago.\nThe official poverty rate today is 15 percent. But by a newly deployed, more comprehensive Census Bureau definition, which provides a more realistic tab on people\u2019s needs and takes into account the effect of government benefits, 16 percent of Americans are poor.\nThis is just 3 percentage points less than in 1967, the earliest year for which the data is available. It amounts to 50 million people.\nWhy so many still? Did the United States wage a war on poverty, lose and move on?\nBy the coarsest understanding of poverty the answer is no. Even the poor have made progress since the \u201860s as the nation\u2019s living standards have risen. If poverty were defined based on what people bought in 1967, adjusted only for inflation, the poverty rate would have fallen to about 11 percent today, according to research by Jane Waldfogel and other researchers at Columbia University.\nBut poverty is best measured relative to the actual living standards of our own society. By the standards of the 19th century, for instance, practically no American is poor. In comparison with Bangladeshis, there are precious few poor in the United States.\nA more nuanced analysis of the evolution of poverty and America\u2019s efforts to combat it is not so consoling.\nRecent research on poverty suggests that government programs have done, in fact, a much better job than the headline statistics suggest. The reason the poverty rate has budged so little is that the job of fixing it has gotten harder.\n\u201cThe government is doing more to reduce poverty now than it did in the 1960s,\u201d Professor Waldfogel said.\nWithout the panoply of government benefits \u2014 like food stamps, subsidized school lunches and the earned-income tax credit, which provides extra money to household heads earning low wages \u2014 the nation\u2019s poverty rate last year would have reached almost 31 percent, up from 25 percent in 1967, according to the research at Columbia.\nIn 1967, government programs moved about 3 percent of children out of poverty. In 2012, they prevented 12 percent of children from dropping below the poverty line.\nHilary Hoynes of the University of California, Berkeley, explained why that has not made much of a dent in the numbers: \u201cA flat poverty trend is better than we would have expected from the structural changes in the labor market.\u201d\nThink of it this way: Despite a half-century worth of technological progress and some fairly robust economic growth for much of that time, the labor market does a worse job lifting people out of poverty today than it did before Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon.\nGovernment transfers in the United States are far more meager than antipoverty efforts in other advanced nations.\nIn 2010, government transfers reduced the Dutch poverty rate \u2014 defined as people with less than half the median income \u2014 from 25 percent to 7.5 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Government programs in the United States, on the equivalent measure, trimmed it to 17 percent from 28 percent.\nUnemployment insurance here \u2014 the main tool to shield workers from adverse turns of the economic cycle \u2014 is far stingier than it is elsewhere. At the same time, Washington offers very little for adults without children on the assumption that they can and should work. But during a recession and periods of slack demand, that is impossible for many otherwise employable people.\nWelfare reform in the mid-1990s, to a large extent, replaced cash payments with food stamps and an expanded earned-income tax credit. But the tax credit is of no use to those without jobs. \u201cIt is not well suited to provide traditional income insurance,\u201d Professor Hoynes said.\nImportantly, government benefits can make it tough for people to leave poverty behind. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of action at the very bottom,\u201d Professor Waldfogel said. \u201cBut once you hit the poverty line a lot goes away.\u201d\nFor a two-parent family with children and a breadwinner earning $25,000, it makes little financial sense for the other spouse to get a job. After subtracting taxes, lost government benefits and the added cost of child care, the family would take in only some 30 cents of each additional dollar, according to calculations by Melissa Kearney and Lesley Turner of the University of Maryland.\n\u201cThere are huge work disincentives here,\u201d said Professor Kearney, who also runs the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThey should be allowed to keep more disposable income. They are doing \u2014 quote, unquote \u2014 what they are supposed to and they are not much better off than they were before.\u201d\nAnd yet for all the shortcomings of the government\u2019s strategy, the main reason for America\u2019s persistent poverty is the disappearance of jobs with decent pay that can take workers above the poverty line without the government\u2019s help.\nThe war on poverty was not just about the poor. President Johnson saw it as a way to \u201cprove the success of our system; to disprove those cynics and critics at home and abroad who question our purpose and our competence.\u201d\nOur system provides extraordinary rewards for the successful. But as long as so many are left so far behind, the success of our system remains in doubt.\nAmerica has not stopped fighting the war on poverty. President Obama\u2019s health law should, when functioning properly, prevent medical expenses from dragging many families into bankruptcy.\nYet winning this war will require more than expanded government benefits. It will probably require a different sort of labor market that provides a better first line of defense. That is a much tougher war to win.",

    "text": "Children Toil in India\u2019s Mines, Despite Legal Ban\n2013-02-25T22:06:02.000Z\nKHLIEHRIAT, India \u2014 After descending 70 feet on a wobbly bamboo staircase into a dank pit, the teenage miners ducked into a black hole about two feet high and crawled 100 yards through mud before starting their day digging coal.\nThey wore T-shirts, pajama-like pants and short rubber boots \u2014 not a hard hat or steel-toed boot in sight. They tied rags on their heads to hold small flashlights and stuffed their ears with cloth. And they spent the whole day staring death in the face.\nJust two months before full implementation of a landmark 2010 law mandating that all Indian children between the ages of 6 and 14 be in school, some 28 million are working instead, according to Unicef. Child workers can be found everywhere \u2014 in shops, in kitchens, on farms, in factories and on construction sites. In the coming days Parliament may consider yet another law to ban child labor, but even activists say more laws, while welcome, may do little to solve one of India\u2019s most intractable problems.\n\u201cWe have very good laws in this country,\u201d said Vandhana Kandhari, a child protection specialist at Unicef. \u201cIt\u2019s our implementation that\u2019s the problem.\u201d\nPoverty, corruption, decrepit schools and absentee teachers are among the causes, and there is no better illustration of the problem than the Dickensian \u201crathole\u201d mines here in the state of Meghalaya.\nMeghalaya lies in India\u2019s isolated northeast, a stump of land squashed between China, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. Its people are largely tribal and Christian, and they have languages, food and facial features that seem as much Chinese as Indian.\nSuresh Thapa, 17, said that he has worked in the mines near his family\u2019s shack \u201csince he was a kid,\u201d and that he expects his four younger brothers to follow suit. He and his family live in a tiny tarp-and-stick shack near the mines. They have no running water, toilet or indoor heating. \nOn a recent day, Suresh was sitting outside his home sharpening his and his father\u2019s pickaxes \u2014 something he must do twice a day. His mother, Mina Thapa, sat nearby nursing an infant and said Suresh chose mining himself.\n\u201cHe works of his own free will,\u201d she said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t listen to me anyway, even when I tell him something,\u201d she added with a bittersweet laugh.\nMs. Thapa said that three of her younger sons go to a nearby government school and that they would go into the mines when they wanted to.\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t do this work, what other jobs are they going to get?\u201d she asked.\nIndia\u2019s Mines Act of 1952 prohibits anyone under the age of 18 from working in coal mines, but Ms. Thapa said enforcing that law would hurt her family. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary for us that they work. No one is going to give us money. We have to work and feed ourselves.\u201d\nThe presence of children in Meghalaya\u2019s mines is no secret. Suresh\u2019s boss, Kumar Subba, said children work in mines throughout the region.\n\u201cMostly the ones who come are orphans,\u201d said Mr. Subba, who supervises five mines and employs 130 people who collectively produce 30 tons of coal each day.\nHe conceded that working conditions inside his and other mines in the region were dangerous. His mines are owned by a state lawmaker, he said.\n\u201cPeople die all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have breakfast in the morning, go to work and never come back. Many have died this way.\u201d\nWhile the Indian government has laws banning child labor and unsafe working conditions, states are mostly charged with enforcing those laws. The country\u2019s police are highly politicized, so crackdowns on industries sanctioned by the politically powerful are rare. Police officers routinely extract bribes from coal truckers, making the industry a source of income for officers. \n\u201cChild labor is allowed to continue in Meghalaya by those in positions of power and authority, as it is across India,\u201d said Shantha Sinha, chairwoman of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights. \nIn 2010, Impulse, a nongovernmental organization based in Shillong, Meghalaya\u2019s capital, reported that it had found 200 children \u2014 some as young as 5 \u2014 working in 10 local mines. The group estimated that as many as 70,000 children worked in about 5,000 mines.\nIts findings led to images in the Indian news media of small children working in horrifying conditions. State officials angrily denied that there was any child labor problem.\nInvestigations soon followed by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, as well as the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, one of the nation\u2019s most respected independent research groups. Both confirmed the presence of child laborers.\nDespite visiting during the monsoon season, when many mines are closed or barely operational, the Tata group found 343 children age 15 or younger working in 401 mines and seven coal depots. The group had intended to conduct a more extensive investigation, but the \u201cresearchers had to stop data collection, as local interest groups threatened them with bodily harm if they continued with the study,\u201d the report noted. \n\n7 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\n\u201cThe mining industry is clearly aware of the issue of child labor and the illegality of the act, and yet children continue to be employed,\u201d the report concluded.\nBindo M. Lanong, Meghalaya\u2019s deputy chief minister for mining and geology, flatly denied the investigations\u2019 findings.\n\u201cThere is no child labor in Meghalaya,\u201d he said in a telephone interview this month. \u201cThese allegations are totally absurd. They are not based on facts.\u201d\nMr. Lanong also said that mines in Meghalaya follow national safety regulations.\nYet, several mines visited in Meghalaya had no ventilation and only one entrance; they followed no mining plan, did not use limestone to reduce explosion risks and had minimal roof supports, among other illegal and dangerous conditions. Their bamboo staircases were structurally unsound and required miners to walk sideways to avoid falling. Miners said those conditions were endemic.\nMr. Lanong responded: \u201cWhat should we do, stop mining? I ask those people if rathole mining is banned, you will be interfering with the liberty of the landowners.\u201d\nDespite offering high pay, mine managers nonetheless have trouble finding enough workers in this area, according to the Tata report. The local tribal population largely shuns the jobs, so children and other laborers are brought here from Nepal and Bangladesh in informal networks that advocates have decried as trafficking. Many are soon trapped in a classic swindle: although pay is high, mine operators charge huge premiums to deliver drinking water, food and other staples to mining camps. As a result, many child laborers are unable to send money home or earn enough to leave.\nThere are few schools near the mining camps, and those that are available teach in local dialects \u2014 languages that immigrant children generally do not speak. So even if they want to get educated, many children cannot.\nWildcat mining has become so endemic in the Jaintia Hills district of Meghalaya that much of the land resembles a moonscape, denuded of trees and brush. Roads are choked with coal trucks, and roadsides are covered with piles of black rocks. Mining has led \u201cto a host of issues such as subsidence, degradation of soil and water resources as well as air pollution,\u201d the Tata report stated.\nBut it has also brought money for those who are from the region. Suresh said he earns $37 to $74 a week, a healthy salary in a country where two-thirds of the population lives on less than $15 per week. He gives the money to his family, he said.\nAfter lunch, Suresh got ready to return underground. He said that he had seen people die, \u201cbut I haven\u2019t had an accident yet.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d he amended, \u201cI hurt my back once when the mud fell in, but we still had to work the next day.\u201d\n\u201cHow can we not work?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe have to eat.\u201d",

    "text": "Collateral Damage\n2013-09-27T15:19:36.000Z\nIn the 40-odd years that America and the Soviet Union faced off in the cold war, the people who presumed to run the world started with the knowledge that it was too dangerous, and possibly even suicidal, to attack one another. But the struggle was fierce, and what that meant in practice was that the competition played out in impoverished places like Cuba and Angola, where the great statesmen vied, eyed and subverted one another, and sometimes loosed their local proxies, all in the name of maintaining the slippery but all-important concept known as the balance of power. \nThe peace held, of course \u2014 that is, the larger peace. The United States and the Soviet Union never came to blows, and the nuclear-tipped missiles never left their silos. For the third world, where the competition unfolded, it was another matter entirely. The wreckage spread far and wide, in toppled governments, loathsome dictators, squalid little wars and, here and there, massacres so immense that entire populations were nearly destroyed.\nIn \u201cThe Blood Telegram: Nixon, Kissinger, and a Forgotten Genocide,\u201d Gary J. Bass, a professor of politics at Princeton, has revived the terrible and little-known story of the birth of Bangladesh in 1971, and of the sordid and disgraceful White House diplomacy that attended it. This is a dark and amazing tale, an essential reminder of the devastation wrought by the hardhearted policy and outright bigotry that typified much of the diplomacy of the cold war. It is not a tale without heroes, though; a number of American diplomats \u2014 most especially a man named Archer Blood \u2014 risked and even sacrificed their careers by refusing to knuckle under to the White House and telling the truth about what was happening on the ground.\nThe story begins, as do so many in our modern world, with the end of the British Empire. In 1947, when the British quit India, they lopped off its majority Muslim flanks in the east and west. At the time, the partition unfolded in a frenzy of murder and expulsion, leaving a million people dead. Pakistan emerged as one of the largest countries in the world, but improbably divided into two parts by more than a thousand miles of Indian territory. When you look at a map from that time, you have to wonder what on earth the cartographers were thinking. \nPakistan carried on for 23 years like that, with the more numerous Bengalis in the east feeling increasingly neglected by their Punjabi brethren in the west, where the capital was. Things came to a head in December 1970, when Sheik Mujib-ur-\u00adRahman, a pipe-smoking Bengali leader, and his party, the Awami League, won the elections on the promise of autonomy for East Pakistan. (Whatever he wanted privately, he did not call for independence.) Rahman never got a chance to form a government. Gen. Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan, egged on by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, the second-place finisher, arrested Rahman and ordered the army to crush the Bengalis. Dominated by Punjabis, the army moved brutally, shooting and detaining Bengali leaders, intellectuals and anyone who opposed them. \nEnter the United States. At the time of the elections, Pakistan, though ruled by a military dictator, was an American ally with an American-equipped military; India, the giant democracy, considered itself nonaligned \u2014 a neutral player in the Soviet-American standoff. Given what was happening on the ground \u2014 the Pakistani Army acting wantonly, ignoring the results of an election \u2014 you might expect the White House to restrain the Pakistani generals. So one arrives at the devastating heart of Bass\u2019s book. (Note: I have interviewed Bass and met him socially a couple of times.)\nAt the time of the crackdown in East Pakistan, President Nixon and his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, were trying to establish relations with the People\u2019s Republic of China, which was only then emerging from the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. Nixon wanted desperately to extract the United States from Vietnam in something less than a catastrophic way and, as focused as ever on the Soviet Union, he and Kissinger believed that opening a channel to China could help them with the war while, at the same time, delivering a blow to the Soviets by exploiting their rivalry with the Chinese. Pakistan and, in particular, Yahya, its military leader, became Nixon\u2019s secret liaison with the Chinese leader Zhou Enlai. Yahya helped lay the groundwork for the visits to China by Kissinger and then Nixon. It\u2019s hard to overstate just how earth-changing Nixon and Kissinger regarded their trips to China \u2014 and how important they thought they were for bringing them about. \nIn practice, this meant that Yahya \u2014 a vain, shallow mediocrity \u2014 was suddenly considered indispensable, free to do whatever he wished in East Pakistan. With the White House averting its eyes, the largely Muslim Pakistani Army killed at least 300,000 Bengalis, most of them Hindus, and forced 10 million to flee to India. Bass lays out his indictment of the White House: Nixon and Kissinger spurned the cables, written by their own diplomats in Dacca (the capital of East Pakistan), that said West Pakistan was guilty of carrying out widespread massacres. Archer Blood, the counsel general in Dacca, sent an angry cable that detailed the atrocities and used the word \u201cgenocide.\u201d The men in the White House, however, not only refused to condemn Yahya \u2014 in public or private \u2014 but they also declined to withhold American arms, ammunition and spare parts that kept Pakistan\u2019s military machine humming. Indeed, Nixon regarded the dictator with genuine affection. \u201cI understand the anguish you must have felt in making the difficult decisions you have faced,\u201d he told Yahya.\nThe voices of Kissinger and Nixon are the book\u2019s most shocking aspects. Bass has unearthed a series of conversations, most of them from the White House\u2019s secret tapes, that reveal Nixon and Kissinger as breathtakingly vulgar and hateful, especially in their attitudes toward the Indians, whom they regarded as repulsive, shifty and, anyway, pro-Soviet \u2014 and especially in their opinion of Indira Gandhi. \u201cThe old bitch,\u201d Nixon called her. \u201cI don\u2019t know why the hell anybody would reproduce in that damn country but they do,\u201d he said. \nThese sorts of statements will probably not surprise the experts, but what is most telling is what they reveal about Nixon\u2019s and Kissinger\u2019s strategic intelligence. At every step of the crisis, the two men appear to have been driven as much by their loathing of India \u2014 West Pakistan\u2019s rival \u2014 as by any cool calculations of power. By failing to restrain West Pakistan, they allowed a blood bath to unfold, and then a regional war, which began when Gandhi finally decided that the only way to stop the tide of refugees was to stop the killing across the border. That, in turn, prompted West Pakistan to attack India. \nAt this point, the recklessness of Nixon and Kissinger only got worse. They dispatched ships from the Seventh Fleet into the Bay of Bengal, and even encouraged China to move troops to the Indian border, possibly for an attack \u2014 a maneuver that could have provoked the Soviet Union. Fortunately, the leaders of the two Communist countries proved more sober than those in the White House. The war ended quickly, when India crushed the Pakistani Army and East Pakistan declared independence. \nNixon and Kissinger spent the decades after leaving office burnishing their images as great statesmen. This book goes a long way in showing just how undeserved those reputations are. ",

    "text": "Over 100 Die in Fire at Chinese Poultry Plant\n2013-06-03T06:44:35.000Z\nHONG KONG \u2014 Explosions and fire tore through parts of a poultry processing plant in northeast China on Monday, killing at least 120 people in one of the country\u2019s worst factory disasters in years.\nChinese news reports said many of the workers who had died had been hindered from leaving the factory, the Baoyuanfeng Poultry Plant, because the exits had been blocked or inadequate. The plant began operations four years ago and was considered a major domestic poultry supplier.\nSurvivors described panic inside the burning plant, as employees unfamiliar with the fire escapes jostled and trampled one another through smoke and flames to reach exits that turned out to be locked.\n\u201cInside and outside the workshop was glowing red, and the lighting and escape indicators were all out,\u201d one worker, Wang Xiaoyun, told the China News Service.\nInternational concern over factory safety in Asia has been growning after accidents that have taken more than a thousand lives. The worst was a collapse of a garment factory complex in Bangladesh on April 24 that killed more than 1,120 people.\nResidents near the poultry factory, in the Jilin Province town of Mishazi, heard explosions about 6 a.m. Parts of the plant were engulfed in flames, but it was unclear whether the fire had broken out before or after the blasts, according to television reports. The Chinese State Administration of Work Safety said 120 people were confirmed to have died, state television said.\nThe provincial government\u2019s microblog news site said that 120 people were confirmed to have died.\nBy late in the day, Xinhua, the official news agency, said \u201cpeople responsible\u201d in the company that operates the plant had been arrested, but it did not identify them. The precise cause of the fire and explosions remained unclear.\n\u201cWhen I woke up, there was smoke rising in the air and sirens, and you knew straight away that it was bad news,\u201d Dong Wenjun, a metal trader in Mishazi, said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t expect it to be this bad. They were all local people, I think.\u201d\nTelevision news showed rescuers picking their way through the blackened debris.\nThe police, fearing more explosions from gas stored at the plant, evacuated nearby residents, the China News Service reported. More than 50 people were taken to a hospital, mostly for breathing difficulties from inhaling toxic gases, reports said.\nGuo Yan, a plant employee, said she had heard a boom and then people shouting that there was a fire, Xinhua reported. One fire exit was blocked, and she had to escape through another, she told the news agency. \u201cPeople were all rushing, pressing and crushing each other,\u201d she said. \u201cI fell over and had to crawl forward using all my might.\u201d\nAnother report, from The Southern Metropolitan Daily, a newspaper in southern China, said only one exit had been open in the area where the fire started.\nChina\u2019s food-processing industry has grown rapidly to feed an increasingly prosperous population in the nation\u2019s cities, and the poultry plant appeared to be one beneficiary of that growth. Dehui City, which administers the area that includes the plant, has promoted itself as a base for commercial agriculture, animal feed production and food processing. By 2011, Dehui\u2019s poultry industry had the capacity to produce 250 million broiler chickens a year and slaughter 150 million of them, according to the Jilin Province Web site.\nJilin Baoyuanfeng Poultry, which owns the Mishazi plant, has more than 1,200 employees, the China News Service said. The company can produce 67,000 tons of chicken products every year, the Agriculture Ministry said on its Web site in 2010.\nChinese factories and mines have been troubled by work hazards during the country\u2019s rapid economic expansion. The frequent industrial accidents have drawn criticism that officials are putting economic growth before safety.\nIn what appeared to be a reflection of the problems, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and President Xi Jinping, who is traveling abroad, both promptly issued orders about the latest disaster. Mr. Xi told officials to \u201cget to the bottom of the causes of this accident, pursue culpability according to the law, sum up the profound lessons and adopt effective measures to resolutely prevent major accidents from occurring,\u201d Xinhua reported.\nThe government does not issue detailed figures for industrial accidents but has said safety is improving.\nOfficial data shows that the rate of deaths per 100,000 workers in industry, mining and business fell by 13 percent in 2012 from a year earlier. It did not release accident and death totals.\nChina\u2019s coal mines are notoriously unsafe. But Geoffrey Crothall, the communications director for China Labor Bulletin, an advocacy group in Hong Kong, said he could not recall a disaster of such magnitude at a factory or production plant. In 1993, a fire in a toy factory in far southern China killed 87 workers, he said. In late 2000, a fire at a shopping center in Luoyang in Henan Province killed 309 people. Mr. Li was the Henan governor at the time.\nMr. Crothall said it was too early to draw definitive conclusions about whether inadequate fire escapes, a longstanding problem in Chinese workplaces, had contributed to the number of deaths at the poultry plant.\n\u201cBut many factories are locked for what the owners or managers consider to be security reasons, and fire exits are not properly maintained or given the priority they should be,\u201d Mr. Crothall said.",

    "text": "Why Is Obama Caving on Tobacco?\n2013-08-22T23:34:16.000Z\nLAST year I endorsed President Obama for re-election largely because of his commitment to putting science and public health before politics. But now the Obama administration appears to be on the verge of bowing to pressure from a powerful special-interest group, the tobacco industry, in a move that would be a colossal public health mistake and potentially contribute to the deaths of tens of millions of people around the world. \nAlthough the president\u2019s signature domestic issue has been health-care reform, his legacy on public health will be severely tarnished \u2014 at a terrible cost to the poor in the developing world \u2014 unless his administration reverses course on this issue.\nToday in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei, representatives from the United States and 11 other nations begin the latest round of negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multinational trade agreement. The pact is intended to lower tariffs and other barriers to commerce, a vitally important economic goal. But if it is achieved at the expense of people\u2019s health, the United States and countries around the world will be worse off for it.\nThe early drafts of the agreement included a \u201csafe harbor\u201d provision protecting nations that have adopted regulations on tobacco \u2014 like package warnings and advertising and marketing restrictions \u2014 because of \u201cthe unique status of tobacco products from a health and regulatory perspective.\u201d This provision would have prevented the tobacco industry from interfering with governments\u2019 sovereign right to protect public health through tobacco control laws.\nCountries (and cities) that have adopted such regulations have had great success reducing smoking rates and saving lives. In New York City, where we have adopted some of the most comprehensive tobacco policies in the world, the smoking rate among adults has fallen by nearly one-third, and among high school students it has been cut in half. This progress helped to increase average life expectancy: in 2010, it was 80.9 years in the city, more than two years longer than in the country as a whole.\nThis week, however, the Obama administration bowed to pressure from the tobacco industry and dumped the safe harbor provision from the trade compact. The tobacco industry was joined by other business interest groups that were fearful that the safe harbor provision would lead to other products\u2019 being singled out in future trade accords. \nSo instead of the safe harbor, the Obama administration is now calling for a clause requiring that before a government can challenge another\u2019s tobacco regulation under the treaty, their health authorities must \u201cdiscuss the measure.\u201d The administration will also try to ensure that a general exception for matters to protect human life or health (typical in trade agreements) applies specifically to tobacco regulation.\nBut these are weak half-measures at best that will not protect American law \u2014 and the laws of other countries \u2014 from being usurped by the tobacco industry, which is increasingly using trade and investment agreements to challenge domestic tobacco control measures.\nIf the Obama administration\u2019s policy reversal is allowed to stand, not only will cigarettes be cheaper for the 800 million people in the countries affected by the trade pact, but multinational tobacco corporations will be able to challenge those governments \u2014 including America\u2019s \u2014 for implementing lifesaving public health policies. This would not only put our tobacco-control regulations in peril, but also create a chilling effect that would prevent further action, which is desperately needed.\nTobacco use causes more deaths around the world than HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined. If nothing is done, one billion people will die of tobacco use by the end of this century. Through my philanthropy, I have supported grass-roots efforts overseas to discourage tobacco use. Bangladesh, for instance, has enacted new rules that are a big step toward banning smoking in public places and on all modes of transportation. In Vietnam, we helped build public support for comprehensive new legislation that includes some of the most effective tobacco-control techniques, like advertising bans and graphic warning labels on packages.\nBut if the trade pact proceeds without the safe harbor provision, this progress will be jeopardized, a devastating setback for the global effort to reduce tobacco use, particularly because the signatories to the trade pact include nations \u2014 like the United States, Australia and Vietnam \u2014 that have some of the world\u2019s strongest tobacco control measures. If the Obama administration caves, the tobacco rules of its own Food and Drug Administration will be subject to challenge.\nI could not be more strongly in favor of trade agreements that expand economic opportunity here and around the globe. But a deal that sells out our national commitment to public health, and forfeits our sovereign authority over our tobacco laws, does not merit the support of Mr. Obama; of the Senate, which would have to ratify it; or of the American people.

    "text": "They\u2019re Old Cricket Hands, but Fresh Faces in The Ashes\n2013-11-19T10:54:20.000Z\nThe Ashes is back. \nAnd when cricket\u2019s most storied rivalry resumes Thursday, two players who will be both veterans and rookies at the same time figure to play prominent roles. \nAustralia\u2019s George Bailey and England\u2019s Michael Carberry are both in their 30s and veterans in their domestic competitions, but each is a novice at the top level of the sport. Bailey has yet to play in a five-day test for Australia. Carberry played once for England three years ago, but he is new to the Ashes.\nTheir call-ups at the start of a series of five five-day test matches reflect the demands of the 136-year-old rivalry. Ideally, selectors want experienced players who have proven themselves in tests, but failing that, they usually choose maturity over potential. \nAt 31, Bailey is the oldest specialist batsman to make his test debut for Australia since 1979, but he will most likely take the field alongside six teammates who will be even older than he is. \nCarberry, 33, is one of eight over-30s likely to play for England. The captain Alastair Cook, who turns 29 on Dec. 25, is one of England\u2019s younger players.\n\u201cThe pleasing thing from my point of view is he\u2019s quite calm,\u201d Australia Coach Darren Lehmann said after Bailey was chosen. \u201cIt is going to get heated at some stage during the summer, and hopefully he\u2019s going to hold us in good stead.\u201d\nCoping under pressure was what Australia did worst when these teams met in England earlier this year. England won 3-0 not because it had a huge advantage in talent, but because it played better in the crucial moments. \nBailey has a journeyman record in major league cricket, where his career average is below 40, hurt by a dip under 20 in his last full season for Tasmania.\nIan Chappell, a former captain of Australia, has questioned whether he has the technique for tests. But Michael Di Venuto, Australia\u2019s batting coach, argued on the ESPN Cricinfo website that \u201cGeorge has always been a player who finds a way.\u201d \nWhile new to tests, Bailey has excelled for Australia in the shorter forms of international cricket, scoring heavily in a recent series of rainy one-day internationals against India.\nHe already leads Australia in Twenty20 cricket and is the backup to Michael Clarke as captain in one-day internationals. And if he does well in the Ashes, it is not unimaginable that he could join the list the 44 players who have captained Australia in tests. \nCarberry will be looking for redemption. It looked as if his England career might have ended in 2010 with a single test match against Bangladesh after he fell ill with blood clots in his lungs. For a while, it kept him from taking long-distance flights, an inescapable part of international cricket.\nHe responded in the best possible way, scoring heaps of runs first for his county team, Hampshire. Carberry is now able to travel again, and he has excelled in England\u2019s three warmup matches since the team arrived in Australia. As a bonus, Carberry is a terrific fielder.\nHis job will be to help prevent the top-order collapses that England suffered in the last series. \u201cHe\u2019s a very experienced player, he\u2019s very relaxed, a calming influence and he knows his game really well,\u201d said Joe Root, the England player who will drop down the order to make way for Carberry.\nAt the other end of the scale of test experience is Kevin Pietersen, who will play his 100th test for England at Brisbane. Pietersen seems to have repaired his relationship with his teammates after a well-publicized blowup in 2012, but England\u2019s bigger worry could be about his knee after he needed a cortisone injection last week.\nLike the classic five-act play, a five-test series offers the potential for ebb, flow and fluctuations in fortune. With five five-day matches crammed into the next 48 days, a good start is important, particularly for Australia, the less settled and experienced of the two teams.\nIt could hardly start anywhere better than the Brisbane Cricket Ground in Woolloongabba, where it has not lost in 24 matches since 1988. Clarke has scored at least 100 four times in his nine tests at the \u201cGabba,\u201d where he averages 114.50 runs per dismissal.\nPerhaps even more important for Australia will be the brilliant but inconsistent paceman, Mitchell Johnson. His return will delight travelling England fans, who have a repertoire of songs deriding the wildness of his bowling, but it will also induce mixed feelings in the top-order batsmen who know how devastating he can be on good days.\nThis is a tough series to predict (other than sleep deprivation for fans in the United Kingdom), but a fair guess is that England will keep the Ashes, either by a single-win margin or under the rule that says the holder keeps the storied urn with a tie.

    "text": "Scores Feared Trapped in Collapse of Mumbai Building\n2013-09-27T07:43:52.000Z\nMUMBAI, India \u2014 Scores of people were feared trapped or dead after a five-story residential building collapsed early Friday morning, the fifth deadly collapse this year in and around Mumbai, a city with crumbling housing infrastructure and poor building standards. At least 11 people were confirmed dead.\nThe authorities said it was too early to determine the exact cause of the collapse or the number of people trapped or dead inside the structure, the Babu Genu Market building. Onlookers said the building had more than 100 residents, nearly all of whom were probably home when the structure fell. The building was about 30 years old, officials said.\nThe scene Friday was a chaotic pile of broken steel and concrete rubble, with more than two dozen fire trucks and at least 15 ambulances on the streets.\n\u201cThe building collapsed suddenly at 6 a.m. this morning,\u201d said Tanaji Ghodge, a deputy police commissioner. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how many people will come out of the rubble yet. The rescue operation is going on in full force.\u201d\nBabu Gupta, a sound engineer who lives next door, said the building had about 24 occupied one-room apartments, each with four to eight residents, underscoring the dangerous overcrowding in many buildings in Mumbai.\n\u201cThere were many people in that building whom I was friends with,\u201d Mr. Gupta said. \u201cWe often played cricket together on this street. There is Parmar, there is Jadhav, there are so many others. There must be at least 15 of my friends in that building. There is no news of them yet.\u201d\nMurli Khadpekar, a neighbor, said he heard a \u201cloud bang\u201d at 5:53 a.m. and came running out to see that the building\u2019s huge rooftop water tank had come crashing down, and that the building had collapsed. The building was mostly occupied by city trash collectors and laborers, he said.\nHundreds of police officers, firefighters, dockyard workers and neighbors crowded around the site of the collapse Friday in the kind of chaotic scramble that is routine after such disasters in India. Police officials tried to clear the area of bystanders. Neighbors watched from balconies and terraces overlooking the spot of the collapse.\nDr. Habbu Jadav, the superintendent of a nearby hospital, said that 25 people had been brought in with injuries as of 8 p.m. Friday and that there were 11 deaths. Family members surrounded hospital officials asking if their relatives were among the dead or injured. Among them was Akhilesh Shinghade, a Mumbai city official who was pacing the hospital waiting area hoping for news of his wife, who is eight months pregnant and had been staying in the collapsed building with her parents.\nHe said there had been five people in the house: his wife, Namita, and her grandmother, parents and sister. \u201cNone of them have been found as yet,\u201d he said.\nDeepteesh Kadam, 16, was admitted to the hospital with a fractured left clavicle after he shimmied out of the building through a small gap. He had been sleeping in his family\u2019s third-floor apartment when the building fell.\n\u201cI got out, but I could not find my brother,\u201d he said.\nIn April, an illegally constructed building in a Mumbai suburb collapsed and killed 74 people, the deadliest such episode in decades. Two more episodes followed in June, killing 19 people together. In July, the Bhiwandi garment factory collapsed, killing six people. Other collapses in India have included a hospital in Bhopal in April.\nThe collapses highlight problems with India\u2019s housing stock and construction standards. Many of the structures that dot Mumbai\u2019s skyline are crumbling and date from the country\u2019s independence in 1947, when they were hurriedly built as part of the city\u2019s emergence as a commercial hub.\nMumbai\u2019s buildings department is known for its corruption, and bribing inspectors and other government officials is considered part of the normal cost of doing business. One result is that many buildings are visibly crumbling. Another problem is rent-control rules that allow tenants to live in apartments for a few dollars a month and even pass those rights on to their descendants, giving landlords little incentive to invest in building maintenance. The city requires extensive approvals for even minor repairs, a process so cumbersome that repairs are often either delayed or done illegally and without consultation from engineers.\nIndia is one of the only countries in the world where buildings as tall as six stories are constructed using a small-batch process of mixing concrete by hand, rather than having trucks deliver premixed concrete. The quality of the concrete can vary considerably with hand-mixing, while premixed concrete is of more uniform quality.\nIn most of the world, structures more than two stories high require premixed concrete not only because of government rules but also because few other places can find workers willing to carry loads of concrete by hand up more than one or two flights of stairs. In India and Bangladesh, workers routinely carry such loads up five or more flights.\nSheetal Shinde stood at a nearby tea stall with tears in her eyes looking at the rescue operation. \u201cThere are five of my relatives in that building,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are still trapped inside.\u201d",

    "text": "No Species Is Safe From Burgeoning Wildlife Trade\n2013-03-12T09:46:45.000Z\nBANGKOK \u2014 A giant inflatable manta hovered over attendants at an event on the sidelines of a major international convention on wildlife trade in Bangkok last week. Bobbing slightly amid the bustle, it made for a startling change from the polar bears and pandas that have come to epitomize the plight of endangered wildlife in the public eye.\nWhile most attention tends to focus on animals like rhinos and elephants where endangered species are concerned, scientists and conservationists warn that, out of the public eye, many other plant and animal species are being severely depleted, in some cases to the point of near-extinction.\nMantas are a prime example of the rapid shifts taking place in the global demand for wildlife, say scientists who have been calling for them to be added to a list of species whose international trade is regulated or banned under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, or Cites, whose adherents are meeting in Bangkok this month.\nNever particularly in demand for their meat, mantas have come under pressure in recent years because of a newfound demand for their gill rakers \u2014 filaments that filter their food from the water.\n\u201cTwenty years ago, there was no market for mantas,\u201d said Guy Stevens, director of the Manta Trust, a research and conservation group. Now perhaps 3,000 to 4,000 of the animals, which are found in tropical waters around the globe, are killed every year. The gill rakers find their way to the dried-seafood markets of the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou. \nThere, they are hawked as an ingredient for a health tonic, selling for the equivalent of several hundred U.S. dollars per kilogram.\nGiven that manta populations are thought to number just a few hundred thousand, and that they produce just 10 to 16 young per lifetime, said Mr. Stevens, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that this will have a big impact on this population.\u201d In some places, he added, manta populations appear to have already disappeared, wiping out potential dive-tourism revenues that far outstrip the cash generated by the gill trade. \nThe plight of the mantas highlights a worrying increase in the global demand for wildlife \u2014 including for animals and plants that have historically faced little or no pressure. \nAnd the species is by no means unique. \nUnder Cites, which was signed 40 years ago, the international trade in more than 30,000 animal and plant species is regulated or banned. The status of several dozen more is being discussed at the Cites meeting in Bangkok, among them mantas and several kinds of turtles, sharks and timber trees. \nAt a vote on Monday, delegates approved tightening the trade in mantas, as well as in five shark species \u2014 the oceanic whitetip, the porbeagle and three types of hammerhead sharks. Conservationists welcomed the decisions, but they remain subject to final approval by a plenary meeting on Thursday, the last day of the conference.\nWhatever the final outcome of these and other votes at the meeting, conservationists warn that inclusion on the Cites list of threatened species \u2014 while important \u2014 is no cure-all. \nThe trade in many species often continues even after it is banned and is increasingly driven by highly organized syndicates, experts say.\nTrading in illegal wildlife ranks among the five most lucrative illicit markets globally, after counterfeiting and the illegal trafficking in drugs, people and oil, according to Global Financial Integrity, a research and advocacy organization based in Washington. \nThe sheer volume of the wildlife trade \u2014 whether legal or illegal \u2014 has left regulators, conservationists and biologists scrambling to update the regulations needed to keep it sustainable, and to assemble data on newly pressured and less well-known species. For many species, even reliable information on population sizes \u2014 let alone the level of trade \u2014 does not exist and can take years to research.\n\u201cWe\u2019re struggling to keep pace with the sheer scale of the problem,\u201d said Colman O\u2019Criodain, wildlife trade policy analyst at W.W.F. International. \nComplicating the picture is the fact that the nature of the demand has also changed. Within the past decade or two, it has shifted geographically from West to East and broadened across a wider range of species than ever before.\nIn the 1970s, when the Cites treaty was first signed, the issue of wildlife trade was largely one of niche demand for wealthy customers in the West. \nNow, Mr. O\u2019Criodain said, \u201cit\u2019s no longer about furs and skins for boots and coats to be sold in Europe or the United States,\u201d but driven predominantly by a swelling middle class in Asia \u2014 notably in populous and fast-growing China. \nJust as the spending power of Asian consumers has led to soaring purchases of refrigerators, cars and cellphones, so, too, has it caused demand for ivory, shark fins, sea slugs and rosewood furniture to soar. \nTurtles, said Peter Paul van Dijk, a tortoise and freshwater turtle expert at Conservation International in Arlington, Virginia, were among the first wildlife to feel the effect of China\u2019s move to open up to more trade in the 1990s. \n\u201cMassive quantities began to be extracted from one neighboring country after the other in the early 1990s,\u201d he said in an interview in Bangkok. \u201cIt went in concentric circles \u2014 Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Bangladesh, then, later, Malaysia and Indonesia.\u201d\nA burgeoning turtle farming industry began to supply the Chinese food market with large quantities of turtles in the 1990s, Mr. van Dijk said, and about half of the world\u2019s 315 turtle species are classified as endangered under Cites. (Several more have been accorded protection at the current Cites meeting.) \nBut this has done little to reduce the pressure on populations in the wild, where they perform important roles in local ecosystems. \nNonfarmed turtles, Mr. van Dijk said, are highly sought after and can command several hundred U.S. dollars each, largely because of a widespread perception in China, fanned by a string of high-profile food scandals in recent years, that wild-caught animals are of higher quality and safer to eat.\nIn addition, the high price of wild and rare turtles means that, much like shark fin soup, they are considered a status symbol, ordered by people who are eager to display their wealth. \nFor some species, supposed medicinal benefits have piled on the pressure. The golden coin turtle, which is native to northern Vietnam and southern China and is held to cure cancer \u2014 much like rhino horn \u2014 now exists only in very small numbers in the wild, Mr. van Dijk said. \nLikewise, demand for pangolins, scale-encrusted nocturnal creatures that feed on ants and termites, is in large part due to a belief \u2014 not substantiated by scientific research \u2014 that their ground-up scales can stimulate lactation (making it popular with breast-feeding mothers), or cure ailments like asthma or cancer, said Dan Challender, an expert in the species at the University of Kent in Britain.\n\u201cIn the \u201980s and \u201990s, pangolins were destined mainly for the United States and Mexico, where their skins were used in boots and shoes,\u201d Mr. Challender said. Since about 2000, that trade has largely been replaced by demand from China and Vietnam, where the creatures are also seen as a delicacy to be consumed, and can fetch the equivalent of several hundred dollars per kilogram.\nLike mantas, pangolins are slow breeders, and are very hard to breed in captivity. \nThe trade in them has been restricted under the Cites convention since 1975, but illegal trade has continued. At least three seizures weighing in at several tons \u2014 and accounting for thousands of animals \u2014 each have been reported in the past few years. \n\u201cThe magnitude of the trade,\u201d Mr. Challender said, suggests \u201cthat it is ultimately unsustainable.\u201d",

    "text": "That \u2018Made in U.S.A.\u2019 Premium\n2013-11-30T19:54:15.000Z\nThe designer Nanette Lepore is a cheerleader for New York City\u2019s garment district. Most of her contemporary women\u2019s clothing line, which sells at stores like Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale\u2019s, is made locally.\nHer company occupies six floors in a building on West 35th Street and uses, among other businesses, six nearby sewing factories, a cutting room and even a maker of fabric flowers in the neighborhood. She organizes \u201cSave the Garment Center\u201d rallies, writes about the danger of losing local production and lobbies lawmakers in Washington to support the American fashion industry.\n\u201cIf my only option as a young designer was to make my clothing overseas, I could not have started my business,\u201d she said.\nYet Ms. Lepore says that when she signed a deal with J. C. Penney for a low-cost clothing line for teenagers \u2014 clothing that sells for about one-tenth the price of her higher-end lines \u2014 Penney could not afford production in New York.\nOf the 150 or so items she now has featured on Penney\u2019s website, none are made in this country. \u201cThat price point can\u2019t be done here,\u201d Ms. Lepore said of lower-end garments.\nAs textile and apparel companies begin shifting more production to the United States, taking advantage of automation and other cost savings, a hard economic truth is emerging: \u00a0Production of cheaper goods, for which consumers are looking for low prices, is by and large staying overseas, where manufacturers can find less expensive manufacturing. Even when consumers are confronted with the human costs of cheap production, like the factory collapse in Bangladesh that killed more than 1,000 garment workers, garment makers say, they show little inclination to pay more for clothes.\nEssentially, to buy American is to pay a premium \u2014 a reality that is acting as a drag on the nascent manufacturing resurgence in textiles and apparel, while also forcing United States companies to focus their American-made efforts on higher-quality goods that fetch higher prices.\nLast year, Dillard\u2019s, the midtier department store, wanted to promote American-made clothing, according to Fessler USA, an apparel maker in eastern Pennsylvania. It turned to Fessler to produce tops. Theirs was a brief relationship. \u201cAlmost overnight, they called and said, \u2018Made in America just doesn\u2019t sell better than made in Asia, and you can\u2019t beat the price,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Walter Meck, Fessler\u2019s chief executive and principal owner.\nThe pattern repeats across retailers. Brooks Brothers\u2019 American-made cashmere sport coats sell for $1,395; comparable imported ones go for $1,098. At Lands\u2019 End, American-made sweatshirts cost $59, while the ones made in Vietnam cost $25. The label on an Abercrombie & Fitch American-made sweater, which sells for $150, screams about its American origins. But most of the sweaters for sale at Abercrombie are the cheaper ones priced at $68 and up, and made abroad.\nEric Schiffer, known as Ricky, and his business partner, Leonard Keff, last year opened Keff NYC, a knitting operation in New York\u2019s garment district. Business has been good, with contracts from higher-price retailers like Abercrombie, Anthropologie and Ralph Lauren. One afternoon earlier this year, Mr. Schiffer watched as a table full of women knotted loose threads on Ralph Lauren gloves destined for the American team in the Winter Olympics next year in Sochi, Russia. (Ralph Lauren chose American manufacturing only under pressure from consumers and government officials up in arms after it supplied Olympics uniforms made in China for the 2012 Summer Games.)\nThough labor costs about 40 percent more than in China, and retail prices end up 20 percent higher, Mr. Schiffer says Keff\u2019s clients \u2014 and, more important, their customers \u2014 can afford it.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t work with the Targets and the J. C. Penneys of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not for everyone. It\u2019s really just for the higher-end companies.\u201d\nPaying for Quality, or Not\nAmericans spend more than $340 billion a year on clothes and shoes, more than double what they spend on new cars, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association. And they say they want to buy American, even if it hits them harder in the pocketbook.\nTwo-thirds of Americans say they check labels when shopping to see if they are buying American goods, according to a New York Times poll taken early this year. Given the example of a $50 garment made overseas, almost half of respondents \u2014 46 percent \u2014 said they would be willing to pay from $5 to $20 more for a similar garment made in the United States.\nIt is a sentiment that advertisers have picked up on. In the first half of 2013, according to the most recent data available from the research firm Kantar Media, spending on advertising by companies like the Toyota Dealer Association, Chevron and New Balance that emphasized products\u2019 American-made status nearly tripled when compared with the first half of 2012.\nThe flurry of new promotions also has the Federal Trade Commission policing made-in-America claims. According to its rules, \u201call or virtually all\u201d of a product has to be both assembled and sourced in the United States in order to qualify.\nBut shoppers\u2019 statements that they are interested in American-made goods don\u2019t always square with how they actually spend their money, especially when they are on a budget.\n\u201cA while back, we thought we\u2019d stick little American flags on the products made in America,\u201d said Frank Blake, chairman and chief executive of Home Depot. He said he had figured, based on the prevailing marketing wisdom, that customers would flock to the items. \u201cBut whatever segment really cares about it doesn\u2019t make much difference from a retail perspective.\u201d\nSo retailers are focusing on the quality when trying to justify the higher cost of American goods. The exception to Mr. Blake\u2019s rule comes when buyers are willing to pay more for perceived quality. A majority of consumers, rich and poor, say they believe that American-made products have higher quality than imports, according to the Times survey. Fifty-six percent of those making more than $100,000 said so, as did 67 percent of those making less than $50,000.\nLands\u2019 End promotes its American manufacturers as \u201cthe highest-quality companies, working with vendors and artisans.\u201d New Balance says its American products are made by \u201chighly skilled craftsmen.\u201d At L. L. Bean, bags are \u201cstill made by us here in Maine from practically indestructible cotton canvas.\u201d\n\u201cWith higher-end fashion goods, where it\u2019s made is an identifying source of quality,\u201d said Anthony Dukes, an associate professor of marketing at the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California. \u201cBut at the lower end, I don\u2019t get a sense that people pay too much attention to where it\u2019s made.\u201d\nHe said, however, that attention to where items were manufactured \u201ccould catch on and is certainly catching on in food, so things can go in the other direction.\u201d\nGiving Up the Factory\nIt ended last year with a four-inch stack of paperwork from the bank. Fessler USA, an apparel maker in the Blue Mountain foothills of Pennsylvania, was being liquidated after 112 years.\nBy March this year, all except four of the 300 sewing machines had been sold off. The few administrative employees still left on the job had written their names on chairs so they wouldn\u2019t be sold just yet. And Fessler had made its final order, for Michael Stars T-shirts, five months earlier.\n\u201cIt\u2019s eerie,\u201d said Mr. Meck, its chief executive, whose grandfather started the company, then known as Meck & Company, in 1900. \u201cThe lights started to go out throughout the factory: that department\u2019s done, that department\u2019s done.\u201d\nAfter Mr. Meck and his four siblings bought back the company in 1994 \u2014 his father sold it while Mr. Meck was a child \u2014 Fessler met time after time with retailers interested in selling American-made goods and produced batches of American-made fashion T-shirts and knits. Business looked so good that just before the recession, it borrowed $4 million to buy a long, low brick factory with the idea of expanding.\nClients were already shifting work overseas in the 1990s, so Fessler\u2019s strategy was to focus on smaller companies that couldn\u2019t order the large volumes that most Chinese factories required. While Fessler\u2019s cost was double China\u2019s for finished goods, it had quicker turnaround. But as everyone scurried for customers of any size during the downturn, Chinese factories offered airfreight, making their turnaround almost as fast, at about half the cost.\n\u201cAll of a sudden we had competition from China and everyone else,\u201d Mr. Meck said.\nFessler watched one customer after another jump ship. Lucky Brand, which made up 20 percent of its business, discontinued the products it was making at Fessler. Urban Outfitters, its second-biggest customer, told the factory that it was moving work overseas. And as Michael Stars\u2019s business declined with the recession, so did its orders.\nThere seemed to be lifelines at times. J. C. Penney, under new management with Ron Johnson as chief executive, placed a priority on American-made clothing and talked with Fessler about producing there. But as Penney\u2019s revenue fell, its executives stopped returning Fessler\u2019s calls. Cost ruled. Eventually, Mr. Johnson himself was out.\n\u201cWe got a little bit of business \u2014 not enough to recover \u2014 and not many people were willing to pay what it costs to make it in the U.S.A.,\u201d Mr. Meck said. \u201cWe have had people who have walked away from us for a nickel.\u201d\nAs the recession hit in 2008, Fessler\u2019s revenue dropped in half from the previous year. By 2011, the banks started circling. Fessler laid off about half of its staff, stopped its 401(k) match and kept only three days of thread on hand rather than three weeks. Mr. Meck went from bank to bank and investor to investor looking for additional capital, while Fessler tried a bunch of one-off projects that didn\u2019t go anywhere, like fireproof clothing and a Pampers washable cloth diaper with a paper lining.\nMr. Meck still maintains a small office in the factory in Deer Lake, Pa.; much of the plant is being leased by a bottled-water distributor and a fitness training center. In the front of the building, there is a collection of dusty equipment and supplies that haven\u2019t sold: lights, scales, office chairs, wooden hangers, bins of flawed T-shirts. In the former factory, between stacks of bottled water, there\u2019s a dark line on the floor that signaled the end of the knitting room, gray lines where walls once were, yellow safety lines that encircled the sewing area, scratches and bolt holes in the floor where the cutting machines moved back and forth.\nThe old entrance is lined with logos, a who-was-who of clients like Pendleton and Nordstrom. Up on the roof is another sign of Fessler\u2019s once-grand ambitions: a spread of solar panels that Mr. Meck installed to try to modernize the factory.\nNow the hallways are dark and silent. The lights are on because of a motion sensor, but there isn\u2019t much motion these days.\n\u201cThis is what\u2019s left of our company,\u201d Mr. Meck said from his office. \u201cWe have one room.\u201d\nAn Uncertain Bet\nThere are some hopeful signs for retailers, even at the lower end.\nWalmart, which centers its business on inexpensive items, started a program this year to increase its purchasing of American-made goods by $50 billion over the next 10 years. The company says that more than 150 projects are under way, with products ranging from socks to flat-screen TVs.\nWalmart has an advantage that few other retailers can match: Because of its scale, it can push suppliers on cost. For example, it got the price on an American-made towel down to $9.47, or 50 cents less than a foreign-made towel previously for sale. (That $9.47 towel is a premium product at Walmart, where some towels sell for as little as $1.97.)\n\u201cWe do have research that says, yes, it is an attractive proposition, customers will buy more because of the \u2018Made in the U.S.,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Michelle Gloeckler, a Walmart executive who oversees the program. \u201cWe even have some research that says customers will pay more for made in the U.S., but we don\u2019t believe that they should have to.\u201d\nWalmart\u2019s efforts go only so far. Asked if it would push suppliers to provide more apparel made domestically, executives said probably not, because of the labor costs associated with cutting and sewing.\n\u201cThe wages in other countries are still lower than the absolute wages here, so products that lend themselves to more U.S. production are generally more highly automated,\u201d Ms. Gloeckler said.\nThat has drawn criticism from some suppliers. Price targets \u201cbarely cover the cost of the fabric required to make the garments, never mind the salaries and expenses of American workers,\u201d wrote Christopher Dal Piaz, president of the sportswear company SML Sport in New York, in a letter to the Walmart merchandising chief after a frustrating buying meeting. The machine-made products on which Walmart is focusing \u201cdo not build a new middle class,\u201d he wrote. (Walmart says the effort has drawn pledges from manufacturers to create more than 1,600 American jobs.)\nThe average price of a garment sold in the United States is $13.49, according to the NPD Group, an industry researcher. That low price is largely a result of sales at extremely low prices by huge retailers like Walmart, Target and H&M \u2014 sales that are made possible by efficient supply chains and purchases of products from low-cost countries like Bangladesh and Cambodia, said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at NPD.\nBut keeping costs low, which consumers now expect, can often mean lower quality.\n\u201cIn many cases the product that we buy today does not have the same, higher level of standards that we saw in earlier years,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cAre you buying a T-shirt that\u2019s lighter than it used to be? In many cases, absolutely, yes. They had to take things out to keep the price the same.\u201d\nAs some consumers look for higher quality, the door to American-made goods seems to be opening wider. But even at the higher end, companies like Keff NYC say the market is too new and uncertain to bet on the future. Mr. Schiffer, the company\u2019s chief executive, said a lot of companies were still just testing the appetite for American-made goods. After all, it is the shoppers who will make this movement succeed or fail.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not under any illusions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe take orders as we get them. If people come back to us with reorders, great.\u201d",

    "text": "Los Angeles: Goat-Stew City, U.S.A.\n2013-10-18T14:36:02.000Z\nEveryone with Internet access is a critic, but some forms of amateur criticism have higher standing than others. Amateur literary critics, like Dylan Lucia, an Amazon reviewer who gave one star to \u201cFahrenheit 451\u201d (\u201cBradbury is a good writer [I\u2019ll give him that], but I HATE his writing style\u201d), may lack a nuanced understanding of the English language; some amateur film critics, like the IMDB reviewer who gave 10 stars to \u201cWrath of the Titans\u201d (\u201ci never saw a movie this good before in my life\u201d), may have never seen another movie before in their lives. But all of us with a tongue and a functioning digestive tract are authorities on food. After all, we have a commanding range of experience to draw from: we eat, according to one study, an average of 4.9 times a day. When it comes to food, everyone is not just a critic \u2014 everyone is a connoisseur.\nIn such a competitive field, how does the amateur food critic distinguish himself? There are popular review sites like Urbanspoon and Yelp, but they can be egalitarian to a fault. In New Orleans, for instance, Urbanspoon ranks Caf\u00e9 du Monde as the city\u2019s top restaurant; it may have the best beignets and chicory coffee (many natives will scoff even at this), but it serves little else. Yelp lists Joe\u2019s Falafel in Studio City as Los Angeles\u2019s best restaurant. (\u201cPita bread and Gyro is the way to go!!! Well done Joe\u2019s\u201d \u2014 Calvin K. from Marina del Rey.) The true culinary obsessives go elsewhere. They go to Chowhound.\nChow.com is a swarming bazaar of a Web site, with videos, blogs, recipes and product reviews, but Chowhound, its discussion board, is its central square. Unlike its competitors, Chowhound is organized not by restaurant but by discussion topic. By default, the topics are listed chronologically, based on the most recent comment. If you go to the front page of Yelp or Urbanspoon, you will most likely see a listing of the top restaurants in your area. If you go to Chowhound, the headline instead might be \u201cBurmese in Boston?\u201d or \u201cDebrecen, Hungary \u2014 Regional Hajdu-Bihar specialties at Flaska Vendeglo.\u201d Casual readers will click away in confusion.\nBut the site\u2019s chaos, intentional or not, serves a purpose: it weeds out the dilettantes. Only the most dedicated zealots will bother to penetrate the thicket of random subjects and digressive comments. And they will be rewarded. Reading Chowhound is like attending an academic conference at which specialists deliver papers on subjects as arcane, and various, as the best place to eat dim sum in Memphis or how to find blue masa flour in Melbourne.\nAs I wrote this sentence, for instance, the Chowhound board included the following discussion topics:\n\u201cCentral N.J. spots for good Pernil? lets talk pig.\u201d\n\u201cCincinnati \u2014 Russian delis?\u201d\n\u201cWhere do L.A.P.D. officers take their lunch break?\u201d\n\u201cWisconsin Fish Boil Recommendations.\u201d\nInevitably commenters materialize who claim authoritatively that Marina\u2019s International Deli is the only Russian deli in Cincinnati, that the best pernil in central New Jersey can be found at Ada\u2019s Latin Flavor in Long Branch and that L.A.P.D. officers prefer Manuel\u2019s Original El Tepeyac Cafe, Palermo Ristorante and the Denny\u2019s on Wilshire. Responses begin appearing within minutes, and they keep coming for years, long after the original poster\u2019s query has been satisfied. The most recent response to the \u201cWisconsin Fish Boil \u201d thread, for instance, was written by a user named brketo:\n\u201cI grew up in Eau Claire, WI, and we did fish boils all the time. I moved to International Falls, MN, and live on the Canadian border, where I have continued to do the boils. We just did the 6th annual boil at the Sons of Norway Vinland Lodge last Sunday. . . . If you send me your e-mail I will send you pix of the boils and all details.\u201d\nBrketo was responding to comments written more than 10 years earlier. The quest for Wisconsin\u2019s best fish boil, like the pursuit of any kind of higher knowledge, never ends.\nRead Chowhound enough, and you realize that the most obsessive posters are not writing about food so much as they are writing about themselves. Eating is an intimate activity, and when people write passionately about food, they tend to reveal intimate details. The site is helpful as a reference, but mainly I read it in order to understand other people\u2019s obsessions. It\u2019s comforting \u2014 it distracts me from my own obsessions. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone. How else to explain the popularity of \u201cBest Doughnuts in Toronto?\u201d The thread was begun on Nov. 23, 2007, by morgasm, with this plaintive request:\n\u201cHi chowhounders, Can you please tell me where the best donuts in Toronto are? I\u2019m sick of driving to Krispy Kreme in Mississauga. And please don\u2019t say Coffee Time or Tim Hortons, YUCK. What is up with the junk some places in town sell??? Does nobody give a lick about quality?\u201d\nChowhound discussions have a way of rapidly escalating from food recommendations to heartbreaking expressions of loss. Six years later, the contributors to \u201cBest Doughnuts in Toronto\u201d are no longer simply debating doughnuts. They are writing nostalgic laments for a Toronto that no longer exists:\n\u201cThere used to be this little kosher bakery at the corner of Bathurst and Caribou that made THE most amazing homemade doughnuts with crunchy stuff on top. Honestly I\u2019ve not tasted anything like it since.\u201d\n\u201cWho remembers Margaret\u2019s cream filled donuts from their high school cafeteria days? Talk about a sweet treat! Are they still found anywhere?\u201d\n\u201cA Grandad\u2019s donut and a nice coffee chaser on a rainy day will make you weep for the Tim Hortons you remember from your childhood.\u201d\nEven more popular is \u201cWhat Discontinued Products Do You Miss?\u201d:\n\u201cMy father simply adored \u2014 and thus we kids loved it, too :-) \u2014 a kind of grapefruit soda called Wink.\u201d\n\u201cKoogle flavored peanut butter. . . . I think of it on occasion fondly as I remember the good parts of my \u201970s childhood.\u201d\n\u201cHostess Raspberry Chocodiles. A Twinkie with raspberry goo instead of the cream, covered in a chocolate crust (\u00e0 la Ding Dong), frozen. I\u2019m sad!\u201d\nThe most addicted Chowhounders tend to be the most melancholy ones. This makes sense, since the best criticism is motivated by love; dispraise reflects disappointment that the object of criticism fails to live up to the critic\u2019s idealized memory of the past. And nobody I\u2019ve encountered on Chowhound is routinely more disappointed than Dax.\nI discovered Dax when I had to spend two weeks at a motel in the suburbs of Birmingham, Ala. His avatar kept appearing when I scrolled the Central South regional discussion board in desperate hope of finding alternatives to the Chili\u2019s that the motel\u2019s clerk recommended. Dax moved to Birmingham in 2007, and his posts often referenced, in an elegiac tone, the more varied culinary offerings of Boston, his former city. Having landed in central Alabama, he was determined to recapture what he lost.\nDax seemed not only to have visited every restaurant in Birmingham but also to have tried every dish. From him I learned that Pho Que Huong made excellent ca phe sua da; that the salt-and-pepper squid was one of several masterpieces at Red Pearl Restaurant in Homewood; and that the best carnitas are found at the mercado on Green Springs Highway (but only on weekends).\nI recently spoke with Dax, who turns out to be Daxius Burroughs, a 38-year-old insurance executive born in Athens, Ga. He began posting on Chowhound\u2019s Boston board in 2002, when he became homesick for Athens and its barbecue. He read the Boston barbecue threads, sought out the restaurants and panned most of them. In 2007, when he moved to Birmingham for a new job, he became homesick for Boston and the ethnic diversity he encountered there. His first post on the Central South board was a lengthy plea for advice about where to find the best examples of Salvadoran cuisine, Brazilian (\u201cincluding rodizio and beyond\u201d), Indian (\u201call regions\u201d), Chinese (\u201cSichuan, Shanghai-ese, Taiwanese, etc.\u201d), Greek, etc. When answers weren\u2019t forthcoming, the thread deteriorated into group commiseration. Though there are few posters in the region, Dax continues to contribute in the hope of finding others who share his passions. Several years ago he organized a dinner for Chowhounders at the Red Pearl. Only two people showed up.\nWhile Dax is driven to obsession by the scarcity of his options in Birmingham, Los Angeles Hounders have been inflamed by overabundance. No metropolitan area is more ideally suited to Chowhound than Los Angeles, with its league of little nations \u2014 its Little Armenia, Little Bangladesh, Little Brazil, Little Ethiopia, Little Arabia, Little India, Little Russia, Little Persia, Little Phnom Penh, Little Saigon, Little Tokyo and Little Osaka; its Koreatown, Thai Town, Filipinotown and Chinatown \u2014 not to mention the nearly half of the population that traces its ancestry to Latin America. Each community has its own restaurant scene, with its own feuds, regionalisms and family recipes. Combine this diversity with the pseudopodal sprawl of Los Angeles, and the opportunities for obsession are limitless. It is a point of Angeleno pride to know the difference between the Chung King on San Gabriel and the Chung King on Garfield; the correct spellings of \u201ckasha varnishkes,\u201d \u201cseolleongtang\u201d and \u201chuitlacoche\u201d and where to find them; and that the city\u2019s best sushi bar is in a strip mall in Canoga Park, between a Papa John\u2019s and a massage parlor, identified only by a sign that reads \u201cSUSHI.\u201d\nChowhound encourages an insatiable desire for novelty, a tendency that in Los Angeles can be taken to wild extremes. When one Hounder recently raved about discovering sweet-corn ice cream at Brentwood\u2019s Sweet Rose Creamery, fellow Hounders responded with recommendations for garlic ice cream, jalape\u00f1o ice cream, oil-and-black-pepper gelato, chicken-and-waffles ice cream (with actual pieces of fried chicken) and squid-ink-and-black-licorice ice cream. Reading the Los Angeles board makes you understand the real service Chowhound offers. It\u2019s more than a discussion group. It\u2019s a support group.\nLos Angeles may be the last remaining American city in which the local newspaper\u2019s food critic, Jonathan Gold, is a household name. And Chowhound\u2019s Los Angeles board is where the city\u2019s many aspiring Jonathan Golds go to prove themselves. When The Los Angeles Times recently published a list of Gold\u2019s 101 favorite restaurants, a thread immediately appeared on Chowhound in which Hounders bragged about which they had visited, identifying the restaurants by their ranking. NYCnowLA, for instance, wrote:\n\u201c3,4,5,7,8,11,13,15,16,18,19,21,27,30,33,34,38,44,45,46,51,53,56,59,63,66,71,79,84,86,89, 99,101.\u201d\nThis was bested by the canny trvlcrzy, who responded: \u201cCool! My \u2018secret\u2019 hangouts are not on the list!\u201d\nWhen I was visiting Los Angeles this summer, I came across a Chowhound thread about birria, a savory goat stew especially beloved in the central Mexican states of Jalisco, Zacatecas, Michoac\u00e1n and Aguascalientes. Birria translates as \u201cgarbage,\u201d or \u201ca mess,\u201d and in a certain light this is what it resembles. In its most unadorned form, birria is a heap of goat bones floating in brown consomm\u00e9. There are variations, of course, depending on the family recipe. The broth can be reddish, or greasy orangish; the goat can be served with bones removed; mutton or lamb can be substituted for goat; it can be served in a bowl, like a soup, or in tacos, wrapped in tortillas or cactus leaves. Lime wedges, hot sauce and freshly chopped white onions and cilantro complete the picture. Birria is stewed overnight in caldrons, simmering until the cartilage is soft and the meat tender nearly to the point of liquefaction, yielding a consomm\u00e9 with a rich, musky, occasionally nutty flavor. Some Mexican restaurants will serve birria on weekends \u2014 like menudo, it is believed to be a hangover antidote \u2014 but the best examples tend to be prepared by birrierias, which, if they have a menu, often list no more than one item: birria.\nJonathan Gold knows about birria, of course; he has been writing expertly about it for decades. The dish has become a shibboleth of the local food culture; there are 342 discussions mentioning birria on the L.A. board, in which Hounders document their visits to newly opened birrierias, or birrias discovered in churches and at carwashes, and dispute whether Gold\u2019s favorite birrieria, El Parian, deserves that honor.\nThis summer, when a job in Los Angeles fell through, I decided to visit as many birrierias as possible and console myself with consomm\u00e9. I would finally understand, perhaps, what it was like to live like a Chowhounder. I began at Birrieria Chalio in East L.A. because a Hounder, revets2, had called it \u201cthe real deal,\u201d adding, \u201cThe lamb-head tacos are amazing too.\u201d\nChalio was nearly full when I arrived for a late breakfast. A guitarist was serenading a corner table with Mexican ballads. The men sang loudly. They were on the verge of tears. As for the birria \u2014 the consomm\u00e9 was tangy, red and full of bones in unusual shapes, including one in the shape of an arch and another like a woman\u2019s high-heel shoe. There were also bone flakes, sides of fat and gristle, thick black veins and stringy meat.\nI was stuffed, then, when I arrived at Flor Del Rio, about a mile away. Flor Del Rio is a small room, its walls painted with murals of Nochistl\u00e1n, the owners\u2019 hometown. My waitress explained that the birria was her grandfather\u2019s recipe. It was even better than Chalio\u2019s. The consomm\u00e9 was meatier and richer, like a bowl of pan drippings. I skipped dinner that night.\nEl Parian, perhaps having been visited by too many of Gold\u2019s acolytes, includes a helpful warning on its menu: \u201cBirria Meat May Contain Bone Fragments That May Lodge in Your Throat and Cause Choking.\u201d What can I say about El Parian\u2019s birria? I loved every birria I tried. I lost all perspective. Having eaten nothing but birria for two days, my insides were coated with piping hot goat broth. Everything tasted like the consomm\u00e9, even water. I felt bloated, dazed, as if I had been wrapped in gauze. I needed a hangover remedy for the hangover remedy.\nBut I had to make one more stop. A friend of mine who grew up in East L.A. had told me about her favorite birrieria, and I was saving it for last. (She also told me to skip the ones west of downtown: Mexican food on the Westside was not to be trusted.) Her family used to go to the birrieria on Sundays, she knew the family who ran it and she was certain it was better than El Parian, but she told me about it on the condition that I not mention it by name. She didn\u2019t want it to be overwhelmed by crusading Chowhounders. I searched for it on Chowhound. Incredibly, it appeared in none of the 342 birria threads. Perhaps because its name had changed. Even so, the omission seemed stunning. And cheering. It was a relief to know that one restaurant managed to escape Chowhound\u2019s ruthless dragnet.\nWhen I arrived for my second birria lunch of the day, the restaurant was filled with families; there was a 30-minute wait. The goat was easily the most delicious yet, lacking the faintly metallic aftertaste to which I\u2019d become inured. The meat, crisp and salty, was stewed overnight and browned in the oven right before it was served. The consomm\u00e9 had flavors of tomato, fat and smoke. My hands were shaking when I put down the bowl. I didn\u2019t know whether this was the best birria in Los Angeles, or even in East L.A. \u2014 nor, for that matter, whether the restaurant should rank higher or lower than Spago, Jitlada or Fatburger. Really, I couldn\u2019t care less. All I could think about was taking a nap, followed by a green salad and a glass of cold water.",

    "text": "Democracy as Chimera\n2013-09-10T13:48:05.000Z\nThe news from Egypt confirms Plato\u2019s dark forecast about democracy. Early this month the ruling junta in Cairo arrested a labor lawyer and a journalist, raising concerns that the regime\u2019s repression now targets not just Islamists but also secular critics.\nAs Plato warned, extreme freedom risks extreme slavery. He predicted that democracy \u2014 \u201cpeople rule\u201d \u2014 will quickly be dominated by demagogues. Chaos will ensue. To reestablish order, the people will welcome a tyrant. Tyranny will give birth to other evils.\nOne of America\u2019s leading specialists on the Arab world, the late Ambassador Hermann F. Eilts, agreed with Plato. Having helped mediate the Camp David accord between Egypt and Israel in 1978, Eilts became a professor at Boston University. Before his death in 2006, Eilts often shared with me his misgivings about official U.S. support for \u201cdemocracy.\u201d Serving in many posts throughout the Islamic world \u2014 in Iran and Bangladesh as well as in Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Libya (Muammar el-Qaddafi wanted to kill him) and Egypt, Eilts saw up close the pitfalls of authoritarian rule.\nHe disliked Washington\u2019s penchant for bribing dictators and for compelling recipients of \u201caid\u201d programs to buy food, tools and planes made in the United States. Still, Eilts foresaw that \u201cdemocracy\u201d without the rule of law and respect for minority rights could lead to troubles like those forecast by Plato.\nRepresentative government demands far more than formalities. Hermann Eilts\u2019s father left the German diplomatic corps and moved to Pennsylvania just a few years before 1933, when Germany\u2019s president, elected in a multiparty contest, appointed Adolf Hitler chancellor of Germany, expecting him to lead a short-term coalition government.\nHitler quickly changed everything. To gain power, he used and abused the country\u2019s Weimar Constitution, established in 1919 \u2014 \u201cthe most liberal and democratic document of its kind the twentieth century had seen,\u201d according to William Shirer\u2019s \u201cThe Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.\u201d\nWhy then did democracy collapse in Germany and prove short-lived in Egypt? Political malaise is often the product of the prevailing political culture, especially when a country is buffeted by cruel events. Weimar Germany, like Egypt today, was polarized. Left-wing parties fought both liberal and rightist forces. Their struggles, sharpened by worldwide Depression, produced a stalemate at the polls that helped Hitler to neuter democracy.\nEgypt too is deeply split. For decades the Muslim Brotherhood was the only organized force resisting authoritarian rule. Banned from formal political life, it nevertheless enlisted millions of supporters. When Tahrir Square protesters managed to oust Hosni Mubarak from the presidency in 2011, many Egyptians wanted a secular democracy. But the secular groups had no political machine ready for action like the Muslim Brotherhood, whose candidate, Mohamed Morsi, emerged as the new president.\nLike Hitler in 1933-1934, Morsi then acted to create a totalitarian dictatorship. Following weeks of protests, Morsi was unseated on July 3 by a council led by the defense minister, Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, the liberal leader Mohamed ElBaradei, the grand imam of Al-Azhar, Ahmed El-Tayeb, and the Coptic pope, Tawadros II. Soon, General Sisi directed a crackdown against all opponents.\nAs Plato might well have expected, politics in Egypt has gone from bad to worse \u2014 from a moderate dictatorship to an elected but ideologically driven dictatorship to a much more violent and intolerant dictatorship. U.S. officials have been torn between concerns for stability and for self-rule. Washington usually offered its official friendship (plus more than $1 billion in aid each year since 1979) to whoever ruled Egypt. But it has also applauded each move \u2014 real or apparent \u2014 toward democracy, with very little to show for it.\nWashington now faces similar dilemmas in Syria and other countries where authoritarian rule is challenged, not only by opponents of dictatorship but also by other forces seeking to establish their own tyrannies. Many Americans concur that U.S. experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan destroyed any hope that democracy can be engineered from outside.\nEasy answers are lacking. If the political culture is missing, a Weimar-type constitution will not guarantee real self-rule or stability. Cultivating a truly democratic culture takes time. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan left us this axiom: \u201cThe central conservative truth is that it is culture, not politics, that determines the success of a society. The central liberal truth is that politics can change a culture and save it from itself.\u201d\nBut this liberal dream has met more defeats than victories. Russia seemed to opt for democracy in the 1990s, but when Vladimir Putin altered the rules, most voters went along. Even in the United States, democracy remains a work-in-progress. To make it a major policy goal in countries with vastly different cultures is a chimera.\n Walter C.

    "text": "Man Who Helped Image of Wal-Mart Steps Down\n2013-03-09T02:27:02.000Z\nThe chief burnisher of Wal-Mart Stores\u2019 reputation is leaving the company as its image is under new strains.\nWal-Mart said on Friday that Leslie Dach, a former aide in the Clinton administration who is credited with polishing the company\u2019s image through energy conservation, environmentally friendly packaging and philanthropy, is resigning after almost seven years.\nHe is leaving as the company deals with international bribery investigations, questions about factory safety among its global suppliers and scattered protests at stores. Mr. Dach said that his decision was not related to the global giant\u2019s recent problems but that he believed he had accomplished many of the goals of making Wal-Mart palatable to a range of groups. \n\u201cWhen things are going really well, that\u2019s the right time to do it,\u201d said Mr. Dach, who will stay on until June. \nAs the executive vice president of corporate affairs, his duties included overseeing government and public relations and the Walmart Foundation. The president of the foundation, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, was nominated this month by President Obama to lead the Office and Management and Budget, potentially leaving another gap at the company.\nEven critics of Wal-Mart give Mr. Dach some credit. \u201cWal-Mart became much more adept at constructing a public image that would appeal to liberal audiences after he came on board,\u201d said Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, which encourages environmentally conscious development and frequently opposes Wal-Mart\u2019s policies.\nMr. Dach arrived at the company in August 2006 as public opinion soured with criticism of its pay and benefits and claims that its pressure on vendors to cut costs was sending jobs overseas.\nAccording to the YouGov BrandIndex Buzz index, which measures whether people have recently heard positive or negative things about a company, in mid-2007, the earliest data available, Wal-Mart\u2019s score was about a negative 5 on a scale of negative 100 to positive 100, but it rose to the 20s in 2009. After an article in The New York Times last April reported that executives had ignored evidence of bribery in Mexico, it sank to about 7. It recovered before falling again around the holidays, when unions threatened a Black Friday protest and another New York Times article about bribery in Mexico was published. Its score is now around 10, in line with discount retailers as a whole.\n\u00a0\u201cHe helped position them as being good \u2014 good for seniors, good for families, good for the community \u2014 and they really were perceived as bad,\u201d said Michael W. Robinson, executive vice president of Levick, a public relations firm based in Washington. Shares closed on Friday at $73.03, well above the $45 range when Mr. Dach was hired.\nMr. Dach was a Clinton aide who went on to run the Washington office of the public relations firm Edelman. At Edelman, he advised Wal-Mart executives on strategy, including a surprising speech in 2005 in which H. Lee Scott, then the chief executive, said Wal-Mart was going to become more environmentally friendly.\n\u00a0When Mr. Dach began working with Wal-Mart, he said in an interview on Friday, Wal-Mart wanted \u201cto open itself up to those who it might\u2019ve kept at arm\u2019s length before.\u201d Until then, the company largely closed ranks when it was criticized, and unions, environmentalists and other foes were creating ever-louder opposition to the company.\n\u00a0Mr. Dach steered Wal-Mart toward setting energy-reduction goals, pushed some of its vendors like Procter & Gamble to redesign products to make them more environmentally friendly, and added more sustainable products, like fluorescent bulbs and concentrated detergent. \nOn the environmental front, the company has not met all of its goals \u2014 Mr. Scott wanted 100 percent of store waste to be diverted from landfills, and 80 percent now is \u2014 but it has made progress. While critics say Wal-Mart is, by definition, environmentally unfriendly \u2014 as a brand-new big-box store selling disposable goods largely from overseas \u2014 others say its size can force real change.\n\u00a0And on other issues, like selling $4 generic prescriptions and healthier food, and donating to hunger prevention and veterans and women\u2019s causes, it has gained allies, including Michelle Obama and the World Wildlife Fund.\nLabor groups continue to criticize Wal-Mart for unfair wages and poor labor practices overseas, among other issues. The Mexico inquiry continues to loom over the company, and Wal-Mart was shown to be using suppliers in a Bangladesh factory where a fire killed more than 100 workers in November.\n\u00a0John Podesta, chairman of the Center for American Progress and a longtime friend, said Mr. Dach \u201chas had a career both on the civil-society side and in the business world, and I think he wants to do a little bit more of the former.\u201d\n\u00a0Mr. Dach, whose compensation is not disclosed, said he was looking forward to avoiding the commute from Washington to Bentonville, Ark., which he now makes weekly. He will continue consulting for Wal-Mart, its chief executive, Michael T. Duke, said in a note to employees.",

    "text": "The Bronx, Home for Me and Mom\n2013-09-25T17:32:59.000Z\nAs the years passed, Judy Sheridan\u2019s mother, Helen Stoltz, became less and less able to care for herself. \nNow 99, Mrs. Stoltz resided in an assisted living facility in the Bronx, where she had a one-bedroom \u2014 with meals and other services \u2014 for around $3,600 a month. \nMs. Sheridan, an interior designer (sheridaninteriorsinc.com), called her mother three times a day and visited once or twice a week, taking the subway from her combination home and office in Midtown. \nBut the services weren\u2019t quite right for someone with Mrs. Stoltz\u2019s condition, vascular dementia. She rarely went on the organized shopping trips and excursions. \u201cYou have to remember to get to the lobby and get on the bus,\u201d Ms. Sheridan said. \u201cThat\u2019s where my mother was really faltering.\u201d\nMrs. Stoltz had additional help at bedtime, but hiring an aide for daytime hours was expensive and still not ideal. \u201cThe two of them would be staring into space,\u201d Ms. Sheridan said. \u201cMy mother is not good at conversation these days.\u201d\nSo Ms. Sheridan resolved to find a two-bedroom house for herself and her mother. They needed a yard, because Mrs. Stoltz likes to be outdoors.\nThey also required an entrance with few steps. With a top price of around $400,000, Ms. Sheridan went on the hunt a little over a year ago for a two-family, intending to have an income-producing tenant. \nShe focused on the Bronx, where housing prices were comparatively low, and where her mother\u2019s doctors were. \nBut finding an easily accessible house and yard proved difficult. Most of the houses she saw were unsuitable in many ways. Ms. Sheridan assumed that two-family houses would be two side-by-side units, but what she came across was one unit atop another. The owner\u2019s apartment was typically upstairs, sometimes with an exterior spiral staircase to the yard. Ground-floor apartments were usually small studios or one-bedrooms. Many places were in bad shape.\nLast year Ms. Sheridan visited an upholstery shop she had heard about, Custom Design Studio, on Bruckner Boulevard in Mott Haven. The owners directed her to Allison Jaffe of Key Real Estate Services. \n\u201cI was concerned about what was available in their price range and about finding appropriate living space for them,\u201d Ms. Jaffe said. A lot of sellers were \u201coverreaching on their asking prices,\u201d and reluctant to negotiate. \nLast fall the women went to Throgs Neck to see a suitable place \u2014 a detached two-family Cape Cod, converted from a one-family. The listing price was $439,000. Ms. Sheridan offered $370,000, then $385,000. But, concerned about the lengthy bus-to-train or express-bus commute to Midtown, she declined to offer more. \nA house-over-a-store situation arose at a mixed-use brick building on East Tremont Avenue in Schuylerville. A steep staircase led to the three-bedroom residential unit, but the owner had installed a stair lift in front. What they were seeking for Mrs. Stolz was access to the backyard, but as Ms. Jaffe reasoned, \u201cIf you can put a lift in the front, you can put a lift in the back.\u201d\nThe asking price was $469,000. \u201cI absolutely wanted it,\u201d Ms. Sheridan said. She looked forward to updating the interior. As for the chair lift, \u201cMother enjoyed riding up and down in it.\u201d \nBut she would need a commercial loan, which required a larger down payment and had a higher interest rate than a conventional mortgage. The purchase wasn\u2019t financially feasible. \nAnother opportunity came in Allerton, where a semi-attached two-family house, in need of renovation, was listed for $449,000. The two-bedroom lower unit was larger than most and accessible through a door beneath the front stairs. Ms. Sheridan\u2019s offer of around $400,000 was declined. The seller took the house off the market. \n\u201cHe changed his mind and that was it,\u201d Ms. Sheridan said. \nAfter nearly a year, she decided to give up the hunt and leave her mother where she was. \u201cI said O.K., I\u2019m done,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI cannot go through this emotional-roller-coaster thing anymore.\u201d \nLate last winter, Ms. Jaffe contacted her about a place in Soundview, near Parkchester. This one was a bungalow, lacking a rental unit. Ms. Sheridan didn\u2019t want to bother looking, but she went, getting lost on the way.\nShe was amazed to find almost everything she wanted. The house had three bedrooms, a fenced yard and even a dishwasher, something oddly hard to find. \n\u201cJudy was hesitant because this house was listed at $325,000 and there was no income potential,\u201d Ms. Jaffe said. \u201cBut she walked in and said, \u2018This is it.\u2019\u00a0\u201d \nMs. Sheridan bought the place for $295,000. She and Mrs. Stoltz arrived in the summer. The early days were rough, while her mother got used to things. \nMs. Sheridan still works out of her Midtown home office a few days a week. Meanwhile, Mrs. Stoltz now has plenty to do. Even small chores, like emptying the dishwasher, \u201cgive her a sense of purpose and mission,\u201d Ms. Sheridan said.\nThe neighborhood, largely Bangladeshi, feels like the suburbs, Ms. Sheridan said, with welcoming neighbors and \u201cshopping malls instead of fruit vendors.\u201d \nShe added railings to the stairs outside, \u201cbut my mother is doing so well here and is getting stronger, so the stairs are not an issue at all.\n\u201cThere are days now when she doesn\u2019t even take a nap, and that is so phenomenal for me. She is walking better, and she really helps me in the kitchen, and it\u2019s a joyous thing to see.\u201d",

    "text": "Somalis Face a Snag in Lifelines From Abroad \n2013-08-03T15:34:22.000Z\nNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 Compared with the trillions of dollars flowing through the international financial system every day, the estimated $1.3 billion sent each year from small storefronts in Somali neighborhoods in places like London and Minneapolis to families back home in the Horn of Africa is a mere droplet.\nIn a country where 40 percent of the population depends on remittances from relatives abroad, however, these transactions are a lifeline. And because Somalia has little in the way of financial infrastructure, the money transfer companies that make them possible play a central role in keeping the financial ties to the diaspora open, a few hundred dollars at a time.\nBut in an echo of politically charged fights over aid that have vexed Somalia before, the same money transfer services that help keep children in school and elder relatives off the streets also can be used to send money to help finance dangerous groups like the Shabab, the feared Islamist militants who once controlled much of the country.\nHumanitarian groups, politicians and Somalis themselves are now sounding the alarm over plans by the British bank Barclays to suspend the accounts of a number of money transfer companies used to send money to developing countries \u2014 rather than risk a run-in with regulators over potentially abetting the financing of terrorists or money laundering.\n\u201cMillions of people depend on the remittances from outside,\u201d said Shukri Ismail, one of the founders of Candlelight, a nonprofit in the northern region of Somaliland. \u201cIf those remittances stop, it will be literally chaos.\u201d\nThe looming cutoff, expected to occur next Saturday, comes at a time when more and more Somalis have returned from abroad to invest in their home country, build new businesses and jump-start the nation\u2019s economy after years of chaos. In June, the International Monetary Fund established relations with Somalia for the first time in more than two decades.\nLast week in Mogadishu, the capital, Somalis lined up at a branch of Dahabshiil, the largest money transfer business in Somalia and one of those facing a shutdown by Barclays. It was busier than usual for the Ramadan holiday.\nA cutoff would be \u201ca disaster and result in a new phase of hunger and famine,\u201d said Abdinasir Jamal, who relies on money from his sister abroad to survive.\nActivists, academics and politicians in Somalia and abroad have asked the British government to intercede with Barclays. In June, the Somali president, Hassan Sheik Mohamud, appealed directly to the bank in a letter to keep the money transfer businesses\u2019 accounts open.\nMo Farah, the British Olympic gold medalist born in Somalia, has lent his celebrity to the cause, asking for a 12-month extension before the cutoff. \u201cEveryone following the issue understands that Barclays has a bank to run, but this decision could mean life or death to millions of Somalis,\u201d Mr. Farah said in a statement.\nThe move by Barclays would affect not just Somalia but also countries like Bangladesh, Nigeria and Haiti. But Somalia is uniquely exposed because decades of violence and chaos have left it without a functioning banking system. If the money transfer businesses are shut down, experts say, the transfers will not go through other official channels but will be driven underground instead, making it harder to track money going to militant groups.\n\u201cThe alternative is bulk cash smuggling, carrying suitcases of cash across the border from other places,\u201d said Jonathan Schanzer, the vice president for research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a former terrorism finance analyst at the United States Treasury.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to assist people on the ground in Somalia, you have to work with the same remittance houses that are committing violations and assisting groups like Al Shabab,\u201d Mr. Schanzer said.\nWhen the militant group\u2019s clandestine division needed money to pay for a planned wave of assassinations of government officials late last year, the Shabab turned to supporters in the Somali community in Qatar for donations. Shabab operatives used Dahabshiil to send the funds back to Somalia, according to a United Nations report.\nMany major American banks have already stopped working with Somali money transfer businesses. In May, a federal court in Minnesota sentenced two women to prison for sending money to the Shabab.\nThe problem of keeping resources out of the Shabab\u2019s hands has bedeviled Somalia and its donors before. In recent years the United States, concerned that some Somali contractors working for the United Nations were diverting food and money to the Shabab, suspended millions of dollars of food aid, prompting an outcry from United Nations officials who said the decision cut rations to starving people.\n\u201cLeakage to Al Shabab is the cost of doing business in Somalia,\u201d said a diplomat involved in Somalia issues.\nAnne-Marie Schryer-Roy, a spokeswoman for Adeso, a humanitarian and development organization active in Somalia that has used money transfer businesses, including Dahabshiil, to distribute money in the country, said, \u201cThere\u2019s no equivalent to Citibank that could receive those funds and distribute them.\u201d\nWestern Union has only one office in Somalia \u2014 in the relatively stable Somaliland. Elsewhere, Somalis turn to companies like Dahabshiil, which operates in 286 locations around the country.\nAbdirashid Duale, Dahabshiil\u2019s chief executive, said his company had worked with Barclays for 15 years without incident. \u201cWe\u2019re asking them to be fair and transparent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have never committed any violations or assisted any extremist groups.\u201d\nBarclays has come under pressure because it is one of the last banks in Britain providing services to the money transfer businesses. Efforts to find a new bank to work with have proved fruitless, Mr. Duale said, arguing that Dahabshiil follows compliance rules, requires identification and puts customer data through watch lists.\nBarclays defended the action as a necessary compliance step. \u201cIt is recognized that some money service businesses don\u2019t have the proper checks in place to spot criminal activity and could unwittingly be facilitating money laundering and terrorist financing,\u201d the bank said in a statement. \u201cThis is solely about the company\u2019s controls.\u201d\nLast December, the bank HSBC had to pay the American government a record fine of $1.9 billion to settle charges that it had worked with Saudi Arabian banks linked to terrorist organizations, enabled Mexican drug cartels to launder money and transferred money to nations under American sanctions. Last August, a New York regulator warned that he might revoke Standard Chartered Bank\u2019s license after accusing it of helping Iran avoid sanctions.\nBarclays has already been working to extricate itself from a series of scandals. Last year, the bank reached a $450 million settlement over the manipulation of benchmark interest rates, and it still faces an investigation into payments by Qatari investors in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis.\nThe British government is \u201clooking to really back the new government of Somalia with one hand, and the unintended consequences of these regulations is you could throw a lot more people into crisis,\u201d said Ed Pomfret, Oxfam\u2019s policy manager for Somalia. He said that while criticism had focused on Barclays, it was government regulators who needed to make changes to protect the businesses. \u201cThe regulations are basically defeating themselves,\u201d Mr. Pomfret said.\nKen Menkhaus, a professor of political science at Davidson College in North Carolina, said Somalis would find a way to get money back home eventually.\n\u201cThey have hundreds of creative ways of moving money, but it will be less efficient, it will be costlier,\u201d Mr. Menkhaus said. \u201cIf Somalis start doing everything under the table, that\u2019s bad for us, bad for them, bad for everybody.\u201d",

    "text": "Export Fair in China Loses Steam\n2013-10-15T10:57:01.000Z\nGUANGZHOU, China \u2014 With nearly as much floor space as five McCormick Places in Chicago, the sprawling Canton Fair, which opened in Guangzhou Tuesday morning, is a monument to China\u2019s industrial versatility and export prowess.\nBut although the 12 million square feet of exhibits still offer products as varied as wheelbarrows and Segway knockoffs, the autumn session of the fair hints at the broader malaise now afflicting exporters across China and other East Asian nations.\nFor the first time in recent record-keeping, the number of companies with exhibits has declined in both the spring and autumn sessions of the 56-year-old Canton Fair compared with a year earlier. Even during the global financial crisis in 2009, the number of exhibitors dropped in the spring but rebounded in the autumn.\nBuyers from all over the world still milled through the cavernous exhibition halls on Tuesday, but they appeared less numerous than during previous fairs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s slower than this time last year \u2014 today is opening day, and there are not many people here,\u201d said Ding Jiajun, the general manager of the Laizhou Toptool and Machinery Company, a 50-employee manufacturer of wrenches and vises in Yantian, in the eastern province of Shandong.\nChina announced on Saturday that its exports dropped 0.25 percent in September in dollar terms compared with a year ago, below economists\u2019 expectations of 6 percent growth and far below the double-digit growth that China enjoyed for most of the last decade. In terms of the Chinese renminbi, which is what counts for Chinese exporters and overall Chinese economic output, exports fell a startling 3.6 percent last month.\nNor is China alone in its difficulties. South Korea and Taiwan have already announced their export figures for September and fared even worse. South Korea fell 1.5 percent and Taiwan 7 percent in dollar terms from a year ago; Japan has not yet released its figures but has also been struggling, although recent weakness in the yen may have helped its exports.\n\u201cExports are what powered Asia to prosperity,\u201d Frederic Neumann, the co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC, wrote in a research note on Tuesday. \u201cBut the engine is showing signs of serious defects.\u201d\nThe export environment for Asian exporters may grow worse before it gets better. A growing concern for Asian exporters lies in what effect the fiscal crisis in Washington might have on the American economy, and therefore on demand for Asian goods.\n\u201cI am worried about what is going on in the United States right now with the looming debt crisis,\u201d said Li Shenggao, the sales manager at the Cangnan Keegao Arts and Crafts Factory, a manufacturer of gift bags and labels based in Wenzhou, China. \u201cIf no solution is found, sooner or later the U.S. economy will slow down, which will weaken the U.S. dollar and in turn reduce the competitiveness of our products.\u201d\nThe American difficulties occur just as a combination of strengthening currencies and spiraling costs is eroding the competitiveness of Asian manufacturers, particularly in China, the world\u2019s largest exporter.\nThe slow but steady rise of China\u2019s renminbi against the dollar, at about 3 percent a year, is another concern among Chinese exporters. Mr. Li said his costs for plastic and other raw materials were also rising 5 to 10 percent a year, while a shortage of blue-collar labor was driving up workers\u2019 wages 15 percent a year.\n\u201cSkilled workers with some technological know-how are still hard to come by,\u201d Mr. Li said.\nMr. Ding at Laizhou Toptool, who sat in a booth with walls covered with tools in a rainbow of hues, said the cost of steel for his products had finally dipped this year. But wages in his area are climbing more than 20 percent a year as more young people go to college instead of factories, and prefer white-collar jobs when they graduate.\nNicholas Kwan, the research director at the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, an advisory group created by the Hong Kong government that works closely with local chambers of commerce, said the Pearl River Delta region around Hong Kong and Guangzhou would continue to lose low-end manufacturers like garment producers to even lower-wage places like Bangladesh. But he predicted they would retain higher value-added manufacturers, like those in the electronics sector.\n\u201cThose who are constantly focused on the low end of the market will keep on moving,\u201d he said, noting that garment factories moved to China in the last three decades as wages in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan rose, and were now moving again.\nLouis Kuijs, an economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland, said Chinese exports in September had been slightly suppressed by a statistical quirk. China has cracked down in recent months on the practice among exporters of overstating invoices so as to bypass currency controls and bring additional money into China, speculating on further appreciation of the renminbi.\nIf the effects of excessive invoices are excluded, Chinese exports may have grown 1.7 percent in September from a year earlier, when measured in dollars, instead of shrinking 0.25 percent. But it still means exports shrank in renminbi terms.\nThe renminbi has climbed 2.4 percent against the dollar so far this year and 3.3 percent since the end of September last year. China is trying to foster increased consumer spending to offset slower exports; it has had some success, but not enough to keep overall growth from slowing.\nA bigger export problem for China and its neighbors these days is that demand is now drying up in emerging markets. Economic growth in these markets, increasingly important for China in particular as the United States and European economies have slowed, has weakened in recent months as investors shifted money to industrialized countries in anticipation of higher interest rates.\nChina\u2019s exports to the member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations rose 9.8 percent last month compared with a year earlier, an anemic pace versus the 30-plus percent growth rates in previous months.\nThe result has been even more ferocious competition among Chinese exporters.\n\u201cThe profits of the factory are very, very thin,\u201d said Mr. Ding of Laizhou Toptool, holding his left thumb and forefinger a hair\u2019s breadth apart.",

    "text": "Monuments of a Postindustrial Landscape\n2013-09-20T01:41:57.000Z\nThe first-floor galleries at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art were home until recently to the heart of the collection: 19th-century landscape paintings by Thomas Cole, Frederic Church and Albert Bierstadt, members of the Hudson River School, which were collected by and commissioned directly from the artists by the museum\u2019s founders and earliest patrons. Removed last fall for the installation of a new heating and cooling system, they have been replaced by an exhibition of contemporary photographs that show a very different version \u2014 and vision \u2014 of nature. \nInstead of forests eluding the creep of industrialization or mountains and sunsets full of Romantic-era symbolism, \u201cAn Artificial Wilderness: The Landscape in Contemporary Photography\u201d features monuments of the postindustrial landscape: gas stations, parking lots, and signs and buildings stamped with corporate logos.\nSome of the great analysts of early postwar urban sprawl are here, like Ed Ruscha, represented by a vitrine of self-published artist\u2019s books from the 1960s. One of them, \u201cEvery Building on the Sunset Strip\u201d (1966), is a deadpan representation of exactly what the title promises. Photographed in black and white, the buildings on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles are printed along the edges of a long piece of paper folded into an accordion configuration, with a strip of white running down the middle like a street. Two other books, \u201cTwenty-Six Gasoline Stations\u201d (1962) and \u201cThirty-Four Parking Lots\u201d (1967), function almost like works of contemporary urban archeology, with the parking lots, photographed from above, resembling ancient burial ruins and geoglyphs.\nBernd and Hilla Becher\u2019s mid-\u201960s photographs of cooling towers in Germany document obsolete industrial structures in Europe rather than urban sprawl. Lewis Baltz, who photographed early suburban development, is represented by a much later work, \u201cPiazza Sigmund Freud\u201d (1989), an eerie red-pink triptych of a parking lot near the central train station in Milan. A student of the Bechers, Frank Breuer, uses the tight-cropping techniques of his teachers to frame street-sign logos \u2014 photographed, like the Bechers\u2019 images, against a plain white sky \u2014 and rectilinear buildings that look like minimalist sculptures branded with corporate logos.\nClaire Beckett plays a similar game, photographing real buildings in such a manner that they end up looking unreal. The subject of \u201cAbove Medina Jabal Town, National Training Center, Fort Irwin, California\u201d (2008) is a military building in which storage containers have been painted to look like a town in the Middle East. With its muted desert hues and artificial subject, the photograph looks like a digital animation or a scene from a video game.\nThe works of Louise Lawler and James Welling are more conceptual in their approach, showing how highly constructed our versions of \u201cnature\u201d tend to be. For \u201cFragment/Frame/Text (#163)\u201d (1984), Ms. Lawler photographed a museum wall label next to a landscape painting by Claude Lorrain; only a fragment of the landscape appears in the photo. Mr. Welling\u2019s early-\u201980s images of tin foil, crumpled and then unfolded and photographed, have been compared to everything from night skies to the cosmos. Hung here alongside a dark photo of \u201cFoliage\u201d (1981), the foil photograph, \u201cUntitled (Foil)\u201d (1981), suggests a view into a forest as well.\nThat is not to say that there are no actual forests or mountains here; it\u2019s just that they are generally marked by human intervention. For \u201cgroundspeed (Rose Petal) #17\u201d (2001), the Australian artist Rosemary Laing installed a carpet in a forest in New South Wales, Australia. It has been carefully integrated with the landscape \u2014 tucked under branches and roots and with a few leaves scattered on top \u2014 so that the photograph looks like a digital construction. It is instead an imaginative marriage of \u201cartificial\u201d nature (the carpet with its English rose pattern) and the real thing \u2014 which ends up looking fake, too.\nAna Mendieta was well known for her performance-based photographs, like the fertility symbol in \u201cGuanaroca (First Woman)\u201d (1981), which she carved in a cave in Jaruco State Park outside her native Havana (after nearly two decades of exile in the United States). Also here are several photographs from her \u201cSilueta\u201d series from the \u201970s, in which she covered her body with mud or flowers or ash and stood near trees or lay down in gravelike trenches. \nAn artist who is more of a copyist than an originator is Andy Goldsworthy, whose 1996 photographs of a hole carved into a mound of snow built in the space below a low tree branch feels like a redux of works by earlier artists like Ms. Mendieta and Nancy Holt (who is not included here).\nThe photographs of Edward Burtynsky, although they look artificial, are perhaps the most \u201creal\u201d in the show \u2014 and the most sobering. The home page of Mr. Burtynsky\u2019s Web site includes a quotation by the artist that encourages us to have \u201ca certain reverence for what nature is because we are connected to it,\u201d and \u201cif we destroy nature, we destroy ourselves.\u201d\nMr. Burtynsky has traveled around the world photographing despoiled sites. A photograph of a vast concentration of discarded automobile tires (at its peak, 42 million tires) is captured in the relatively deadpan \u201cOxford Tire Pile #1, Westley, California\u201d (1999). But more often Mr. Burtynsky\u2019s documents of environmental disaster are photographed at times of day and in such a fashion that they look hauntingly beautiful \u2014 earning them a place in the art world\u2019s slightly unflattering category of \u201cruin pornography.\u201d Bangladeshi ship breakers, who undertake the dirty and dangerous work of tearing apart old freighters, are captured here in photographs that are as richly romantic as a painting by Thomas Cole or Caspar David Friedrich (and with the same compositional tricks of scale: tiny humans are dwarfed by the hulking wrecks of the freighters).\nBut in many ways, Mr. Burtynsky\u2019s photographs seem the most at home in these galleries at the Wadsworth, where the elegant rooms and careful lighting created a theatrical stage for 19th-century paintings that show nature in a majestic light. They do the same for the high drama of what Mr. Burtynsky photographs: a sadder, uglier side of humans\u2019 interaction with nature. ",

    "text": "Women Fuel Rise in Remittances From the Gulf\n2013-06-27T19:16:43.000Z\nDUBAI \u2014 For the past decade, Mary Molina Ramos has lived outside her native Philippines, working abroad to support her family back home. She has been employed as a live-in housemaid in Dubai for the past three years, sending her entire monthly salary of about $400 back to the Philippines. \n\u201cIt feels good to support my family; I miss them all the time, but I can do more for them here than if I am with them,\u201d said Ms. Ramos, 39, who works for a family of four in Dubai. \u201cI am so happy I will be able to send my daughter to university next year.\u201d \nThat is an opportunity Ms. Ramos never had. After finishing high school, she entered the work force right away to support her parents, and later her own family. Salaries for women who go abroad are typically much higher than in the Philippines, particularly in the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council, where Ms. Ramos now lives. Before moving to Dubai, she worked in Jordan for four years and in Hong Kong for two, each time as a live-in maid.\nMs. Ramos\u2019s salary is paying to put her daughter, 17, and son, 14, through school in the Philippines. It also provides living expenses for them and for her two ailing parents, who are the children\u2019s carers. Her estranged husband has not participated in family life since her second child was born, and she has been the sole provider for the household since then.\nMigrant workers in the Gulf Cooperation Council \u2014 Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 send more than $50 billion in remittances back to their home countries annually, with more than 100 percent year-to-year growth in remittances over the past decade, according to 2012 data from Western Union, a global money-transfer company. The rise in remittances from the Gulf reflects the significant presence of foreign workers in the region, with an increasing number of female migrant workers each year.\n\u201cThe G.C.C. is one of the highest remittance outflow areas globally, with Saudi Arabia coming in second in the world after the United States,\u201d said George Naufal, an assistant professor of economics at the American University of Sharjah, in the United Arab Emirates, who co-authored a report on the topic last month. Data from Western Union show that $27 billion in remittances were sent from Saudi Arabia in 2010, compared with $40 billion from the United States. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait had remittance outflows of $8.7 billion and $11.7 billion, respectively, that year, holding top-ten spots for global remittance levels.\n\u201cIn terms of migration, one of the main changes is the increased representation of women who are working abroad to support families at home,\u201d Dr. Naufal said. \u201cIn the early 80s, it was more common for men to leave home to make enough money to return, or in the hope of bringing families later to host countries. But women are now taking this role more often.\u201d \nHistorically, the oil and natural gas exporting states of the Gulf Cooperation Council relied on workers from less prosperous Arab countries, including Egypt and Syria, to meet their labor needs. Things shifted in the 1990s, when an increasing share of the labor market in the region was filled by women from countries including the Philippines, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Nepal and Bangladesh.\nThe rising number of women who are migrating abroad and sending their salaries back home represents the main change in international migration patterns in recent years, according to the new research by the American University of Sharjah that is based on figures and remittance patterns supplied by Western Union.\n\u201cWomen working in the G.C.C. and sending money home are not just putting food on the table and paying medical bills,\u201d said Sobia Rahman, Western Union\u2019s vice president for the Gulf, Pakistan and Afghanistan. \u201cThey are contributing heavily to the human capital buildup in their home countries by educating the next generation, which is one of the most effective means of economic development.\u201d \nThe growing economic role of women is also increasing their independence and influence over household decisions back home, according to the report by Dr. Naufal and Ismail Hakki Genc, a professor of economics at the American University of Sharjah. \nAn increase in education spending is the most consistent trend in countries where a larger share of resources lands in the hands of women, according to the report. \u201cWomen also spend less in their destination country, often remitting their entire monthly salaries back home,\u201d Dr. Naufal said. \u201cThey are very actively participating in the economic development of their hometowns.\u201d \nThe Dubai Remittance Survey Data, which collected data during the spring of 2008 from an undisclosed sample of foreigners taken from the 2008 national census, found that female workers sent home an annual mean of 16,473 dirhams, or $4,485, which is about 2,000 dirhams more than what male workers sent to their home countries in the same period.\n The latest figures available from that survey, taken in 2010 out of a sample of 1,409 men and 95 women from Asia, most of them working in the services industry, measured education levels. Although the sample size is skewed because it includes far more men than women, the data showed that 59 percent of women had university degrees, compared with 30 percent of men.\n \u201cHigher education doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into a skilled job,\u201d Dr. Naufal said. \u201cThese women typically work in retail, at restaurants, in salons and as housemaids, and have lower salaries than male counterparts.\u201d \nMs. Ramos hopes to continue working in Dubai until both of her children have completed a university education and found jobs. \n\u201cI would love if my daughter becomes a nurse,\u201d she said. \u201cShe can choose anything she wants. I will be happy that I helped her find any work she likes.\u201d",

    "text": "A Tennessee Clothing Factory Keeps Up the Old Ways\n2013-08-14T22:12:25.000Z\nNot long ago, I got an e-mail from a man thanking me for mentioning his label, Pointer Brand, in an article in 2006. This was no thank-you note. I read on: \u201cWith a lot of hard work and persistence, we recently celebrated 100 years of manufacturing in Bristol Tennessee.\u201d It was signed: \u201cJack King, fourth generation, L. C. King Manufacturing Company.\u201d\nBefore I took the bait and called him, I looked up the article. Pointer makes work clothes that are part of the rural South: a light canvas jacket worn into the field in the morning and removed as the sun rises, dungarees and overalls of various types depending on well-marked preferences: low-back in Kentucky, high-back in Georgia. But these details I learned later. My article merely stated that the designer Junya Watanabe had modified some Pointer jackets for his men\u2019s line. These changes, funnily, were not unlike the careful and ingenious improvements that farmers used to make on their old clothes, except the Watanabe deluxe versions started at $800.\nThe people at the Tennessee factory were oblivious of all this. Oh, they knew a Japanese firm had requested some items, but they never took the trouble to find out more. Not indifferent but perhaps numb is a better description of Jack King\u2019s response, because indeed he did crave a connection to high fashion.\nIt was hard not to be impressed by the position he was in: he owned a factory in the South that hadn\u2019t been modernized, which in the eyes of sophisticates made it a diamond in the rough, and yet, to him, in 2006, it often felt like a lump of iron strapped to his back. As I soon discovered, he came to the factory reluctantly, in 1999, when his father, Riley, became ill. Jack was in his dream job in Atlanta, at a food broker, he said, \u201cstudying the French fry market for the Pacific Rim.\u201d\nWhile looking up the article, I decided to punch \u201cL. C. King\u201d into the newspaper\u2019s archive. Up came dozens of citations for not only L. C. King but also the H. P. King department store and E. W. King, a dry goods wholesaler; all were in Bristol. They appeared in a column, Arrival of Buyers, that ran from the preflapper era to the dawn of designer ready-to-wear, in 1970. If you sold or made goods in the United States and you wanted it known that your buyer was in town, you telephoned a number to register. In 1930, you dialed LACkawanna 1000.\nThe lists astonished me. From Hecht\u2019s Reliable stores in Baltimore, to Kaufmann\u2019s in Pittsburgh, to Laskin & Bro. in El Paso, they were a virtual directory of American retailing in an age before Walmart. I saw the O\u2019Neil Co. of Akron. My mom bought her stockings \u2014 Hanes South Pacific, three pairs to a box; did a little wiggle walk when you lifted them out of the tissue \u2014 at the Coshocton, Ohio, branch.\nWhy I should be amazed at lists of defunct companies, when many closed for well-known reasons, I can\u2019t say. Certainly the global fashion industry doesn\u2019t need our dirty old factories. It has gotten along without them for 30 years, after all.\nOn the other hand, a drive to Tennessee might be interesting, I thought. It was May. In the back of my mind was the Rana Plaza building collapse in Bangladesh that killed 1,129 people, but my last thought, and still my last thought, was that a little factory in the Appalachians, near the Virginia line, was going to make a difference. It was David and Goliath; a campfire compared to the industrial Hades of south China.\nAnd you can\u2019t fault the Chinese for taking the lead in apparel and textile production in the \u201980s, for modernizing, when Western nations, including ours, wanted to be in new technology industries, though for many people that wound up meaning low-wage fast-food jobs instead of work in a clothing factory at twice the pay.\nNo, I was simply looking for something that felt feasible. A road trip, a different conversation from the ones I was having. I called Jack King, and a week later was 650 miles down I-81.\nOn the phone, I found out a little more about the company. L. C. King is the oldest cut-and-sew factory in the United States still owned by its founding family. In addition to Pointer, which Mr. King\u2019s great-grandfather, Landon Clayton King, a sportsman, created in 1913, the factory produces work and outdoor garments for other companies. At one time these included Sears, Bass Pro Shops and 700 Walmarts in the Southeast, he said, but Nafta, in the mid-\u201990s, took out that business \u2014 first a chunk, then all of it.\nMr. King spoke matter-of-factly, and was very polite. As he said, \u201cI\u2019m not here to dog anybody.\u201d Before Nafta, though, the factory employed 130 people, and now it\u2019s 28. Having Mr. Watanabe\u2019s endorsement made a big difference in terms of confidence, he said. \u201cIt really helped us know that we can sew stuff that people want as fashion.\u201d\nIn the last two years a number of new designers, a number of designers interested in American-made, have used the factory. \u201cWe\u2019ve got one label from Knoxville \u2014 Marc Nelson \u2014 his stuff is absolutely gorgeous,\u201d Mr. King said.\nHe then said he planned to travel to London soon to meet with an individual who had been involved with Nudie jeans, as he believed L. C. King could be developed as a brand. And Mr. Watanabe has been back in touch.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing some jeans for him right now,\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cHis office called and asked, \u2018Can you do 200 pairs?\u2019\u00a0\u201d That number falls short of minimums in Los Angeles jeans factories. \u201cMy attitude is, heck, I\u2019ll do anything.\u201d\nBefore we hung up, he said: \u201cWe start at 5:30 a.m. Yes, ma\u2019am, summer hours. There\u2019s no air-conditioning.\u201d\nI ARRIVED just after 8. The factory sits a block from Bristol\u2019s main drag, trim and plain, its red brick and slanted dusty windows newly washed with sunlight. In spite of the hour, the factory didn\u2019t seem busy. I waited on the sidewalk, thinking someone might see me, and then I entered and climbed the stairs to the factory floor.\nStraight ahead was a vast room with a cutting table, the length of a bowling alley, and at the end was a man \u2014 Will Holt, he is \u2014 pushing an electric knife through a stack of denim. The pine floor was a dark patina. There was hardly a noise except the purr of sewing machines or the slap of the pocket machine and a radio somewhere. The place was archaic, its rhythms from another time. It was beautiful.\nEventually I found Mr. King in the gym he had installed in a space once filled, pre-Nafta, with Bass Pro Shop gear. Several middle-aged employees were doing pull-ups with a trainer named Chad. \u201cI\u2019m an athlete, a competitive swimmer,\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the employees to think a workout would be on their time. It\u2019s an option.\u201d\nA medium-built man, 50, in jeans and a brown plaid shirt, with a tense air and a booming laugh, Mr. King introduced me to Ben Collins, hired about a year ago to handle social media and other types of communication. Then we went on a tour of the factory, starting in the stockroom, where wooden crates from the \u201930s serve as shelves for chore jackets and brand-new blue overalls.\nOver the next two days, and later on the phone, it was Mr. Collins who helped unravel the enigma of L. C. King \u2014 and of Jack King, as well. Perhaps it is because he is a sensitive observer, and an outsider, who recognizes what a valuable asset the factory is in Mr. King\u2019s world \u2014 maybe more than Mr. King does.\nThe other person who helped was Marinda Holt, who has worked at L. C. King for 26 years. Skilled at almost any job in the factory, with abundant hair and a sassy charm, she works most closely with the outside designers who come in. She\u2019s a remarkable woman.\nMr. Collins had owned an ad agency in town, and after selling it, considered joining a major firm. He said: \u201cThe agencies I was encountering just had no taste. It\u2019s like your end game is Chick-fil-A. I think coming to work here was a fantasy I was living. I walked by it all the time. My wife, Cam, built the back end of the Web site. I thought: \u2018Why not? This is going to be an unpredictable and rewarding experience.\u2019 I\u2019m so happy I\u2019ve done it.\u201d\nEarly on, he saw that Pointer was getting lots of traffic from Reddit, thanks to Japanese hipsters and West Coast workwear fans, and the company was ignoring it. Clearly Mr. Collins regards L .C. King as this delicate organism. \u201cAs someone who was burned out on fake marketing, I got here and I suddenly felt, \u2018Don\u2019t touch anything,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said, with a laugh. For instance, he found out that the founder was a Harley fan who owned custom guns and shoes.\n\u201cL. C. didn\u2019t wear overalls,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel he\u2019s one of the keys.\u201d\nJack King\u2019s actions are harder to figure. He surprised me when, as we were coming into the factory\u2019s original, sun-faded office, he said: \u201cI can\u2019t get Cone Denim to return my phone calls. I\u2019ve called their office, no lie, five times in the past year.\u201d Cone, in nearby Greensboro, N.C., is a renowned supplier of narrow selvage denim, made on \u201940s-era looms. It\u2019s hard to harbor serious fashion ambitions without it. Mr. King shrugged. \u201cBut that\u2019s O.K. People don\u2019t really know L. C. King Manufacturing exists. I am the secret of the South. I really am.\u201d\nYet, between 2004 and 2011, he did make connections with fashion folks in New York, including Lee Norwood, a senior executive at Ralph Lauren, who helped Mr. King develop a pattern for a $60 five-pocket jeans style, today one of L. C. King\u2019s best sellers.\n\n11 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\n\u201cHe\u2019s done a good job with very little help,\u201d Mr. Norwood said. \u201cBut he needs someone he can trust on the creative side. There\u2019s so much to be uncovered there, but it has to be done with vision. I told him, \u2018You\u2019ve got what every fashion brand doesn\u2019t have: purity.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nIn fact, initially, part of the problem was that Mr. King really didn\u2019t know what a factory did. As a boy, he wasn\u2019t allowed on the sewing floor. Also, he said, \u201cMy dad and I had this really torrid relationship.\u201d He didn\u2019t get full control of the factory until 2009.\nMs. Holt recalled: \u201cWhen Jack first got here, I couldn\u2019t stand him, to be honest with you. He thought it had to be his way or no way. \u2018We\u2019re going into fashion.\u2019 But we weren\u2019t into fashion then. We were in overalls and dungarees. I remember him and Riley getting into it so many times. He was so cocky. In his $200 pair of jeans, and here we are in our Walmart specials.\u201d She laughed. \u201cBut he\u2019s changed that, too \u2014 a whole lot. I love him like family now.\u201d\nMr. King said that and similar comments I heard were accurate. \u201cI basically swallowed my pride and sucked it up and said, \u2018Well, I\u2019m going to be like this now instead of who I used to be.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nAt the end of my first day in Bristol, Ms. Holt showed me some designers\u2019 jeans made in the factory \u2014 by Lumina, a casual men\u2019s line in Raleigh. N.C.; the beautiful Marc Nelson hand-distressed jeans; and a cool pair of Ruell and Ray by Ashley James, who left the factory after she and Mr. King tangled. Still, Ms. James said: \u201cThere\u2019s a gold mine \u2014 a gold mine. The skill set is there.\u201d\nIt is amazing to think that in eastern Tennessee there is a workwear factory that functions as an atelier where designers are free to work. Mr. King invites them in. It is not the refined quality of an Los Angeles factory or of, say, 3x1, Scott Morrison\u2019s SoHo facility. It is a different quality. After trying to make his Marc Nelson jeans in Los Angeles, Marcus Hall, a charismatic guy who used to be a contractor, came to L. C. King.\n\u201cLet me say this: in Los Angeles, it was very duplicated,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like, here in Bristol, it\u2019s done by hand, like the human touch is clear.\u201d Mr. Hall, who has produced 3,000 pairs of jeans in different styles at the factory, added, \u201cBy me coming here, it\u2019s helped them to learn and take them out of their box.\u201d\nIF YOU WANT to know what makes fashion truly different (and maybe, as well, our stores and our communities), the answer is not a designer or a marketer. It is a manufacturer.\n\u201cFactories don\u2019t just exist as factories,\u201d Robert Kidder, the owner of New England Shirt Company, in Fall River, Mass., said one afternoon. \u201cThey have to have a purpose and fulfill something special. American product has to be different.\u201d\nIn four years, Mr. Kidder, a former men\u2019s wear executive, has built a thriving business making private-label shirts for brands like Polo but also the nation\u2019s growing number of men\u2019s shops. No minimums. He recently cut an elbow-patched oxford shirt for a shop in Westerly, R.I., called Huxter. The owner, who got the idea on a whim, started the summer with 45 of the $132 shirts. So far, he\u2019s sold 300.\n\u201cIf you approach American-made with that attitude,\u201d Mr. Kidder said, \u201cit allows you to see how you can rebuild an industry in pieces.\u201d\nWhen I caught up with Mr. King after his London trip, he said the plan is now to bring the L. C. King brand more into the world. He said he had spoken to a group of investors about possibly adding $500,000 in new machines. And he\u2019s even reached Cone. Of course there are enormous challenges. One, as Tracy Doyle, the chief branding officer at Box Studios in New York, notes, is how to put a new spin on the craft story now that luxury brands have made it old hat.\nBut at least Mr. King is not such a secret anymore. The other day a major Nashville star contacted him about making some clothes.\n\u201cHis laugh echoed through the whole factory,\u201d Ben Collins said. \u201cHe just has pride in his people and the factory. He wants this company and this town to make out O.K.\u201d",

    "text": "Acquired Tastes of Asian Art\n2013-02-21T22:55:45.000Z\nRecently, and resoundingly, America\u2019s big museums have shifted their collecting habits. Not only are they buying new art like mad, but a lot of that art also comes from outside the Western Hemisphere, particularly from Asia. The Guggenheim Museum, now embarked on a single-mindedly non-Western shopping spree, leads the pack.\nAfter a decade or two of trying to colonize the planet with Guggenheim franchises the museum is now taking the easier route of bringing the world to New York through an acquisitions campaign supported by the Swiss bank UBS. Over the next five years, under the auspices of the Guggenheim UBS MAP Global Art Initiative, the museum will focus on buying art in three roughly defined geographic areas: South and Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East and North Africa.\nPurchases will be scouted out by curators hired on two-year residencies and the results put on view in three exhibitions, the first of which, \u201cNo Country: Contemporary Art for South and Southeast Asia,\u201d is up and running. Organized by June Yap, an independent curator from Singapore, with help from Helen Hsu and Alexandra Munroe of the Guggenheim, it\u2019s a smallish show of 22 artists and collectives, but it takes in an immense stretch of turf \u2014 the Indian subcontinent, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.\nThe title, adapted from a Yeats poem, is meant to warn us off seeing the art as either narrowly representative of various nations or as expressing the spirit of some exotic, never-never land Asia. Yet many of the strongest pieces speak quite specifically about the cultures from which they come, as, of course, does most \u201cWestern\u201d art, even if we\u2019re too close to it to see its determining contexts.\nA few of the artists in the Guggenheim show are internationally prominent and have been for some time. Two of them \u2014 Amar Kanwar, from India, and Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook, from Thailand \u2014 work primarily in video. Their contributions are being screened in the museum\u2019s New Media Theater and are absolutely worth seeking out.\nBest known for her 2005 Buddhist-inflected video called \u201cThe Class,\u201d in which she instructs six shroud-covered corpses in the art of dying, Ms. Rasdjarmrearnsook also appears in her new video here, this time sitting on a futon with some of her pet dogs watching television. The show on her TV looks like a high-gloss soap opera, but other images start leaking through: buildings burning, policemen swarming and protesters being bludgeoned. Soon similar images are flickering, large, across the walls of the room, immersing the artist and her pets in a sea of political chaos.\nMr. Kanwar has routinely worked on an epic scale; violence, active or latent, is a recurrent subject, as it is in the trilogy of videos here, which in different ways refer to the 1947 partition of India and its bloody, long-term consequences. The first film documents the daily changing of the guard at a checkpoint on the India-Pakistan border, a ritual of precisely choreographed provocation. The second revisits the assassination of Gandhi in 1948. A third piece, \u201cNight of Prophecy,\u201d is in effect a choral symphony of anguished chants and prayers.\nIn galleries on the second floor pride of place is given, by size alone, to a painting by Navin Rawanchaikul, who made a youthful New York debut at Asia Society in 1996, when a global market for contemporary Asian work could hardly be imagined. In the 2009 painting here, done in mock-heroic Bollywood billboard style, he reviews his own history as the son of Indian immigrants to Thailand and a globe-trotting art star.\nSeveral other artists similarly invest popular and traditional forms with new meaning. Vincent Leong, from Malaysia, produces witty, obviously impromptu versions of formal colonial-era family photographs. Khadim Ali, from Pakistan, uses the conventions of miniature painting to comment on the repression of an ethnic minority in Afghanistan from which he is descended. The Vietnamese artist Tuan Andrew Nguyen carves small wood images of the monk Thich Quanc Duc who in 1963 immolated himself in protest against the United States-supported Diem regime. The wood Mr. Nguyen uses for his carvings are American baseball bats.\nOther cultural heroes, huge in their homelands but barely known here, also get attention. Two artists from Myanmar, Tun Win Aung and Wah Nu, husband and wife, have assembled a multimedia tribute to the Burmese independence leader U Aung San (1915-47), father of the pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. What we see in the gallery \u2014 a painting, two videos, a group of plaster busts \u2014 is a merely the tip of an archival project consisting of thousands of objects and documents.\nThe writing of history is almost unavoidably partisan, political and personal, though in ways not necessarily easy to read. The messages are clear in a text painting by Norberto Roldan about the colonization of the Philippines, and in a lethal-looking sculpture of a marriage bed made of stainless steel razors by Tayeba Begum Lipi, an artist from Bangladesh. But other work, removed from where it was made, is less accessible.\nTo understand a video by the Vietnamese artist Tran Luong in which unseen hands snap red scarves against the artist\u2019s bare torso, you have to know the scarves were part of uniforms once worn by schoolchildren under communism. A 1990s oil painting by another Vietnamese artist, Truong Tan, of a nude male figure strapped horizontally to a cross makes full sense only when you know that it refers to trials undergone by the artist as an openly gay man in a homophobic society.\nAnd then there are pieces that give no clues as to their meaning but are enticing anyway. This is true of a group portrait photograph by the Filipino artist Poklong Anading in which all the sitters hold mirrors, reflective side turned toward the camera, producing a blinding explosion of light.\nIt\u2019s also true of an extraordinary video by an Indonesian artist, Reza Afisina, who literally slaps himself black-and-blue, as if under brutal interrogation, while reciting verses about truth telling and salvation from the New Testament. And it\u2019s true in another work, a video by Ho Tzu Nyen from Singapore. Called \u201cThe Cloud of Unknowing,\u201d it combines mysticism, madness and the mundanities of daily life with references to El Greco, Constable and Chinese painting. The piece makes no logical sense and is completely transporting.\nEven this intensely experiential film benefits from information provided by wall labels. Other work in the show requires such information to be understood in its new location. Inevitably this will be an irritant for viewers who demand that art should visually hand them everything they need to know. And it is partly that blinkered, slow-to-die attitude that has kept the New York art world narrow in its interests and short on global information.\nTo what extent we want to receive such information through a museum\u2019s alliance with a bank \u2014 especially one that features an Art Competence Center and offers its clients \u201cvaluable access to a global network of art experts\u201d \u2014 is a question too. The corporate character of the present art market is a vexing subject for many longtime art world insiders, who see it as antithetical to an old-time cottage-industry model of artistic creativity. As it is, the Guggenheim\u2019s South and Southeast Asian collection gathered so far has few out-of-market surprises. References to biennials and Documentas pepper these artists\u2019 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.\nTo most visitors, though, the only thing that matters is what\u2019s on the wall \u2014 or the floor, or the video monitor. And by those lights the inaugural acquisitions show has serious attractions. \nIt\u2019s also worth noting that for the next few months the New York Guggenheim will virtually be a pan-Asian museum, with a Gutai survey filling the rotunda, an exquisite solo show by the Indian-American artist Zarina in side galleries, and work by this year\u2019s Hugo Boss prizewinner, Danh Vo, who was born in Vietnam, arriving in March. \nBut loan shows like these are temporary. The permanent collection, theoretically at least, stays forever. The collection is the museum. In \u201cNo Country\u201d you\u2019re seeing part of an institutional future taking shape as you watch.",

    "text": "Rival Economists in Public Battle Over Cure for India\u2019s Poverty\n2013-08-22T01:14:17.000Z\nNEW DELHI \u2014 She is 7 years old, covered in dirt and spends her days asking for food from pedestrians and drivers in one of this city\u2019s central business districts.\nHer name is Rohini, and other than pleading for bread, she had little to say when asked about her life. Instead, she threaded her way through thick traffic to her mother, Kamlesh, who on a recent rainy day was carrying one of Rohini\u2019s sisters, a toddler with a cloudy eye and a disturbingly quiet demeanor.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the money to send the kids to school,\u201d Kamlesh said simply.\nIndia\u2019s inability to pull Kamlesh and hundreds of millions of others out of desperate poverty despite decades of robust economic growth has been one of history\u2019s great governance failures and economic mysteries.\nDoes India simply need more time for growth to work its magic, or is there something fundamentally wrong with its formula? Do improvements in health and literacy create growth or simply derive from it? And would India\u2019s people have better lives if the government focused on improving workers\u2019 skills or on bettering investors\u2019 opportunities?\nThose are some of the questions behind an unusually nasty fight between two of this nation\u2019s greatest economists. It is a fight that has echoes in poor countries across the globe.\nThe battle between Amartya Sen, a Nobel Prize winner and Harvard professor, and Jagdish Bhagwati, an eminent professor at Columbia University, has broken out just as India\u2019s economy seems to be coming undone. The rupee has plunged to historical lows against the dollar, and extraordinary efforts by the government to stem the slide, including limits on investments abroad by Indian companies, appear to be having little effect. Growth has fallen to 5 percent annually, and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh recently admitted that it was unlikely to snap back soon. Foreign investors are turning away, and the nation\u2019s stock market has recently swooned.\nInto this combustible mix came Mr. Sen and Mr. Bhagwati.\nA courtly man with a cackling laugh, Mr. Sen, 79, is one of India\u2019s greatest living intellectuals. His speeches are thronged, his pronouncements make news and college students give him the kind of rock-star adulation that economists in the United States may never know.\nMr. Sen returned to India this summer to promote his new book, \u201cAn Uncertain Glory,\u201d co-written with Jean Dr\u00e8ze. In an interview, he said that he had no idea that his book tour would make national political news or that he would be forced to defend himself against his old rival, Mr. Bhagwati.\nAfter Mr. Sen made critical comments about an opposition politician, he was denounced by Hindu nationalists. But in an interview, he said that those who view him as sympathetic to the governing Indian National Congress Party have probably not read his book, which is a searing indictment of India\u2019s present government and every previous one.\nIn the book, Mr. Sen argues that India, almost alone among emerging Asian nations, has failed to invest substantially in the health and welfare of its people. This failure could doom its economy and people, he says, because a country\u2019s future growth depends just as much on its social infrastructure as its physical state.\nIndia\u2019s economy grew nearly 8 percent annually in the past 10 years, second only to China among major economies. This improved incomes for hundreds of millions and created a growing middle class that in recent years has thronged Delhi\u2019s streets in protests about corruption and gang rapes. Meeting the growing expectations of this middle class has become a potent political issue.\nBut Mr. Sen argues that India\u2019s growth has failed to translate into substantially better lives for hundreds of millions of others. He points out that countries like Bangladesh, which have grown far more slowly and have much lower income levels, have performed better on key indicators like life expectancy.\n\u201cLiving conditions in the poorer half of India are not much better, if at all, than in the poorer half of Africa,\u201d Mr. Sen wrote.\nIndeed, nearly a third of all newborn deaths occur in India. One in three malnourished children are Indian, and rates of malnutrition are higher in India than in sub-Saharan Africa. Such facts serve as the core of Mr. Sen\u2019s book, and they are the kind of realities that much of India\u2019s elite have trouble even discussing, he wrote.\n\u201cRapid economic growth has not achieved much on its own during the last 20 years or so to reduce India\u2019s horrendous levels of child undernourishment or to enhance child immunization rates,\u201d he wrote.\nThese problems are hardly addressed \u2014 some say even worsened \u2014 by miserable government nutrition, education and health care systems, but Mr. Sen\u2019s prescription is to expand these compromised programs.\n\u201cThere has been a kind of write-off of public institutions by this administration, and they think the only thing that works is business, so they think the more we put in the hands of business the better,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a disastrous position to take.\u201d\nThis argument is one that Mr. Bhagwati and his co-author on \u201cWhy Growth Matters,\u201d Arvind Panagariya, denounce as not only mistaken but dangerous, since they view money spent on government programs as largely wasted.\nMr. Bhagwati, who is also 79, is one of the world\u2019s great trade economists, but he has lived in the shadow of Mr. Sen\u2019s Nobel for much of his professional life, and it clearly irks him. If his written criticism of Mr. Sen\u2019s work is shrill, his verbal criticism is downright nasty.\n\u201cMy impatience with him is that he is obfuscating things constantly,\u201d Mr. Bhagwati said in one of his less incendiary descriptions.\nTo Mr. Bhagwati, India\u2019s myriad problems have less to do with poor health and literacy than a poor investment climate. Give people jobs and money and they will invest in their own education and health, he said.\nMr. Bhagwati\u2019s embrace of the private sector is widely shared in India. Only the poorest send their children to government schools and hospitals, and the central government now promotes public-private partnerships.\nSome economists in India resolve the debate by saying that both have good ideas but go too far with them.\n\u201cBoth guys are at the extremes of the spectrum,\u201d said Ajay Shah, a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy in New Delhi. \u201cWe need to reinvest in some government programs and end others altogether.\u201d",

    "text": "A Wave of Sewing Jobs as Orders Pile Up at U.S. Factories\n2013-09-30T01:45:11.000Z\nMINNEAPOLIS \u2014 It was past quitting time at a new textile factory here, but that was not the only reason the work floor looked so desolate. Under the high ceilings, the fluorescent lights still bright, there were just 15 or so industrial sewing machines in a sprawling space meant for triple that amount.\nThe issue wasn\u2019t poor demand for the curtains, pillows and other textiles being produced at the factory. Quite the opposite. The owner, the Airtex Design Group, had shifted an increasing amount of its production here from China because customers had been asking for more American-made goods.\nThe issue was finding workers.\n\u201cThe sad truth is, we put ads in the paper and not many people show up,\u201d said Mike Miller, Airtex\u2019s chief executive.\nThe American textile and apparel industries, like manufacturing as a whole, are experiencing a nascent turnaround as apparel and textile companies demand higher quality, more reliable scheduling and fewer safety problems than they encounter overseas. Accidents like the factory collapse in Bangladesh earlier this year, which killed more than 1,000 workers, have reinforced the push for domestic production.\nBut because the industries were decimated over the last two decades \u2014 77 percent of the American work force has been lost since 1990 as companies moved jobs abroad \u2014 manufacturers are now scrambling to find workers to fill the specialized jobs that have not been taken over by machines.\nWages for cut-and-sew jobs, the core of the apparel industry\u2019s remaining work force, have been rising fast \u2014 increasing 13.2 percent on an inflation-adjusted basis from 2007 to 2012, while overall private sector pay rose just 1.4 percent. Companies here in Minnesota are so hungry for workers that they posted five job openings for every student in a new training program in industrial sewing, a full month before the training was even completed.\n\u201cIt withered away and nobody noticed,\u201d Jen Guarino, a former chief executive of the leather-goods maker J. W. Hulme, said of the skilled sewing work force. \u201cBusinesses stopped investing in training; they stopped investing in equipment.\u201d\nLike manufacturers in many parts of the country, those in Minnesota are wrestling with how to attract a new generation of factory workers while also protecting their bottom lines in an industry where pennies per garment can make or break a business. The backbone of the new wave of manufacturing in the United States has been automation, but some tasks still require human hands.\nNationally, manufacturers have created recruitment centers that use touch screens and other interactive technology to promote the benefits of textile and apparel work.\nHere, they are recruiting at high schools, papering churches and community centers with job postings, and running ads in Hmong, Somali and Spanish-language newspapers. And in a moment of near desperation last year \u2014 after several companies worried about turning down orders because they did not have the manpower to handle them \u2014 Minnesota manufacturers hatched their grandest rescue effort of all: a program to create a skilled work force from scratch.\nRun by a coalition of manufacturers, a nonprofit organization and a technical college, the program runs for six months, two or three nights a week, and teaches novices how to be industrial sewers, from handling a sewing machine to working with vinyl and canvas.\nEighteen students, ranging from a 22-year-old taking a break from college to a 60-year-old former janitor who had been out of work for three months, enrolled in the inaugural session that ended in June. The $3,695 tuition was covered by charities and the city of Minneapolis, though students will largely be expected to pay for future courses themselves.\nAfter the course, the companies, which pay to belong to the coalition, sponsored students for a three-week rotation on their factory floors and a two-week internship at minimum wage. Then the free-for-all began as the members competed to hire those graduates who decide to pursue a career in industrial sewing.\n\u201cWe need to think practically about getting skilled labor,\u201d said Ms. Guarino, a founder of the training effort, known as the Makers Coalition. \u201cThe growth is there but we\u2019re going to be in trouble if we don\u2019t have a pool to draw from.\u201d\nLast year, there were about 142,000 people employed as sewing machine operators in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area, which had almost 1.75 million workers last year \u2014 and where the unemployment rate as of July was 4.9 percent \u2014 only 860 were employed in 2012 as machine sewers..\nAirtex had room for 50 of them. \u201cWe are looking for new sewers every day,\u201d said Mr. Miller, the Airtex executive.\nWooing Immigrant Workers\nAirtex\u2019s roots in Minneapolis date to 1918, when Mr. Miller\u2019s grandfather started the Sam Miller Bag Company, specializing in potato and feed bags. In the 1980s, Susan Shields founded a baggage company, and the two combined in 2000 as the Airtex Design Group, producing home textiles for companies like Pottery Barn and Restoration Hardware.\nSoon after the merger, the company began producing in China, first in the Dongguan area, then Wuxi and Shanghai. Today, it still employs about 100 Chinese workers through a partner factory in Dongguan, but production there is no longer the bargain it once was, said Ms. Shields, Airtex\u2019s president.\nInitially Airtex paid $3 an hour on average for its Chinese workers; now, it pays about $11.80 an hour, including benefits and housing.\nIts American factory-floor workers make about $9 to $17 an hour, though Airtex estimates benefits add another 30 percent to those figures.\nAs costs were rising in China, Airtex was also getting a new message from some of its clients: They wanted more American-made products.\nHealth care clients wanted medical slings and other sensitive medical products made domestically to ensure quality. Retailers did not want to pay overseas freight costs to import bulky items like pillows, and they wanted more flexibility in turning around designs quickly. As Airtex considered production in Vietnam and elsewhere, it became concerned about safety and quality issues \u2014 and increasingly interested in the American alternative.\n\u201cThe opportunity for domestic business right now is unbelievable,\u201d Ms. Shields said. \u201cEither we start to bring it back here, more of it, or we start going to places that are marginally unsafe.\u201d\nBut the lack of workers here in Minnesota made shifting business back home frustrating.\nIt had gotten to the point where new business sometimes felt like a headache, not an opportunity. As Mr. Miller was headed to Chicago for a sales pitch in February, for instance, he was more worried than excited about landing a new contract.\n\u201cWhat concerns me is, if I get it,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere are we going to find the people?\u201d\nIn the various waves of American textile production, dating to the 1800s, the problem of an available and willing work force solved itself.\nLittle capital was required \u2014 the boss just needed sewing equipment and people willing to work. That made it an attractive business for newly arrived immigrants with a few dollars to their name and, often, some background in garment work. Typically, the mostly male factory owners would recruit female workers from their old countries for the grunt work.\nFrom the 1840s until the Civil War, it was new arrivals from Ireland and Germany. From the 1880s through the 1920s, it was Russian Jews and Italians, who would buy newly mass-produced Singer sewing machines and often set up shops in their tenement apartments with wives, daughters and tenants making up the initial work force, said Daniel Katz, provost of the National Labor College and author of a book about the garment industry.\nPuerto Ricans, who were given citizenship on the eve of American entry into World War I, and black migrants from the South rounded out the work force until the 1960s, when Chinese and Dominican laborers took over, Mr. Katz said.\nIn San Francisco and New York, a small number of Chinese women came to the United States despite the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 barring Chinese laborers, making up a base of garment workers. After 1965, when immigration restrictions eased and Chinese were allowed to join family members, greater numbers of women came and that pool of workers grew.\n\u201cIt was pretty well known that basically the day after you landed, you\u2019d be taken to a factory by a relative to learn how to use an industrial sewing machine,\u201d said Katie Quan, associate chair of the Labor Center at the University of California, Berkeley. In Los Angeles, Latinos made up much of the work force. And in the Carolinas, Hmong immigrants filled textile manufacturing jobs well into the 1990s, halting \u2014 or at least delaying \u2014 the migration of jobs overseas, said Rachel Willis, an American studies professor at the University of North Carolina.\nNow, here in Minnesota, immigrants are once again being seen as the new hope.\n Wanted: English and Math\nLast fall, Lifetrack, a nonprofit group in St. Paul that helps immigrants, people on welfare and those with disabilities, began screening clients for possible admission to the sewing training program. Inside a gray-green room in a building on the edge of a four-lane road, people gathered around three tables: Burmese women at one of them, Ethiopian men at another, and at the back of the room an African-American woman, then 61, and a white man, 60, both born in America.\nThe first task was for students to test their English and math proficiency. Language skills are essential so workers can communicate with their bosses, but math skills are just as important in textile work because sewing requires precise measurements. As the students worked on the proficiency tests, Tatjana Hutnyak, Lifetrack\u2019s director of business development, went over the basics.\nStarting wages: $12 and $16 an hour. Transportation: The college, Dunwoody College of Technology, is on a bus line, but if students interview with a company not on a bus line, Lifetrack will help them get there. After passing career-readiness tests, students could qualify for the course, which would give them a certificate in industrial sewing \u2014 and, ideally, a job.\n\u201cThey want to have a career rather than packaging, assembling, cleaning jobs,\u201d said a Lifetrack manager, Dagim Gemeda, explaining why clients were interested in the sewing certification.\nThe Burmese women had come to Minnesota after spending time in refugee camps in Thailand. Paw Done had done piece work, sewing at home while she watched her children. The others had little sewing experience.\nThe Ethiopian men, who ranged in age from 21 to 42, had been in this country several years. A couple were students, one was a former custodian who had moved from another state to be close to his college-bound son, and a fourth, Abdulhakim Tahiro, had been laid off from his job at an airport car rental kiosk.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good, for my level it\u2019s good,\u201d Mr. Tahiro said of the starting wages.\nMr. Tahiro and Ms. Done enrolled in the course that started last January, when about half of the class were immigrants. Another student in the course, Patricia Ramon, 56, was an entrepreneur in Mexico with sewing experience. Ms. Ramon already had a job as a sewer at J. W. Hulme, but quit to take the course with the goal of obtaining certification. She wanted proof, she said, that she had technical skills.\n\u201cI am not like an old-time seamstress,\u201d Ms. Ramon said. She expects to sew as a career, and said that making $16 an hour with health insurance would be enough to live on.\nThe students who were not immigrants often had difficult work histories or other problems. One of them was Lawrence Corbesia, the man sitting at the back table during the screening session. He was a former machine operator and custodial worker who had been looking for work for three months.\nAnother was Edward Johnson, 44, who was homeless when the course started. After food service and call-center jobs, he went to prison for felony assault, and had a tough time finding a job when he got out in 2009. He moved to Wisconsin to pick fruit, moved back to Minneapolis because he hated picking fruit, and was living on the streets and selling watercolor paintings when a homeless-center counselor hooked him up with the sewing program.\nUntil now, the only sewing experience Mr. Johnson had was sewing on buttons \u2014 a punishment meted out by his mother when he misbehaved. To save money, Mr. Johnson walked the 45 minutes to and from the college.\nThe program was overwhelming at first, he said, \u201cso frustrating that sometimes I\u2019d go home crying.\u201d But he spent days at the library, watching YouTube videos on sewing techniques and studying terms used by the industry. By the end, it had gotten easier, he said, making pajamas, tote bags and aprons.\nSo many people are on government assistance, he said. \u201cI\u2019d rather learn a trade and go to work \u2014 and work,\u201d he said.\n A Long-Term Solution\nManufacturers elsewhere are also trying to build a new labor pool.\nIn a former glove factory in Conover, N.C., the Manufacturing Solutions Center has touch screens showing the technologies that textile manufacturers use today, while new machines spool out printed fabric. In Pennsylvania, a work force investment board has started a program with plant tours, YouTube videos of workers and a Web site promising that \u201ccontrary to popular opinion, many good jobs in manufacturing are still available.\u201d\nOther industry groups have created a curriculum for high schools on manufacturing, including Manufacturing Day, with factory tours for school groups.\nStill the difficulty attracting young people frustrates Debra Kerrigan, a dean at Dunwoody overseeing the Minnesota program.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just the idea of, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m a sewer,\u2019 that doesn\u2019t thrill the average young individual today,\u201d she said. \u201cSkills for a lot of different industries are coming back now, machinists and automotive workers and sewers. I think if you have a skill when the economy gets bad, you\u2019re more likely to succeed than someone who doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nCompared with the other courses Dunwoody offers \u2014 graphic design, Web programming, robotics \u2014 sewing can seem a little old school, students say. But Elizabeth Huber, 22, who took a break from the University of Minnesota to take the sewing course, said that can also be a selling point.\n\u201cI like getting back to making things, to touching and manipulating materials rather than just pushing buttons or tweeting all day,\u201d she said.\nAs the sewing course drew to a close, members of the Makers Coalition were jostling for the 18 graduates. Don Boothroyd at Kell\u00e9, a firm that makes dance costumes, hoped to snag 10 of them. J. W. Hulme wanted five, and was considering covering a student\u2019s tuition for another course exchange for a contract promising that the student would work at Hulme for one year. Airtex hoped for five to 10 students.\nBut only nine students completed the course \u2014 many dropped out for personal reasons, or decided they just weren\u2019t interested in the work \u2014 and eight got jobs. The coalition is now revamping the curriculum to focus more on hands-on work and machine maintenance.\nAirtex decided it could not afford to wait for the coalition\u2019s training program to work out its kinks. So, as the course proceeded, Airtex redoubled its efforts to find people who had some background in sewing. Mr. Miller and Ms. Shields offered a bonus to existing employees who brought in friends. They hosted an open house for prospective workers, and tried to think of groups they had not approached before \u2014 like a nonprofit that works with people with disabilities.\n\u201cI had a guy driving me to the airport the other day,\u201d Mr. Miller said, \u201cand he mentioned he knows a lot of people in the Cambodian community and I should call his pastor.\u201d\nFinally, Airtex decided it had to pay for training itself, even if that meant the company was less profitable for a while. It trains workers for a few hours a week, with a technical-college instructor and existing employees instructing new ones on topics like ergonomics and handling tricky materials. Airtex has since made 10 new hires for floor jobs, none of whom were highly experienced.\n\u201cThe reality is, if we want good workers we know we have to train them and bring them in ourselves,\u201d Ms. Shields said.\nThe factory floor now seems less barren because there are 25 sewing stations (there is still room for another 25). And most significantly, the additional workers mean the company can take on new work: Airtex has tripled its capacity, and is now making about 70 percent of its products in the United States.",

    "text": "At Labor Group, a Sense of a Broader Movement\n2013-09-13T20:45:49.000Z\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 As soon as the delegates to the A.F.L.-C.I.O.\u2019s convention entered the hall, they encountered a booth where three 20-somethings were teaching labor leaders more than twice their age how to use Facebook and Twitter. Behind the booth was a sign saying, \u201cOnline Strategies that Rock the Movement.\u201d\nAt the center of the welcoming hall, brilliantly colored 10-foot-tall posters of workers and union slogans towered over the convention delegates. One giant orange-and-yellow poster resembled an oversize woodcut, showing a farmworker hunched over a wheat field with bold letters, saying, \u201cWorkers Are the Backbone, Not the Blame.\u201d\nAll this was a far cry from the dark, drab, lugubrious scenes found at many union gatherings of the past. After decades of decline, the energy and focus \u2014 and, yes, the artwork \u2014 at this week\u2019s A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention signaled, as one union president put it, \u201cour need to put some movement back in the labor movement.\u201d\nFor the delegates at the convention, which ended on Thursday, there was a burning realization that the status quo was not working for the nation\u2019s labor unions. Wages for union and nonunion workers alike have flatlined in recent years, while the percentage of private sector workers in unions has slipped to just 6.6 percent. That is less than one-fifth the level during organized labor\u2019s prime, when union leaders were confidants of presidents and the mighty Teamsters threatened strikes that could cripple much of the nation\u2019s commerce.\nDesperate to figure out how to stop labor\u2019s descent, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., a federation of 57 labor unions, invited scores of nonunion groups, including the National Organization for Women, United Students Against Sweatshops and Arts and Democracy, to the four-day convention to brainstorm. They debated how to shore up the sagging labor movement, how to raise wages and how to persuade Congress to pass legislation that would help 11 million undocumented immigrants gain citizenship.\nEven the use of art as an inspirational tool was discussed. The convention\u2019s motto \u2014 \u201cDream, Innovate, Act,\u201d festooned in multicolor signs around the hall \u2014 seemed like something one would expect from a dance troupe and not an often plodding movement lacking in imagination.\nAt times the convention seemed like a mass group therapy session, with a consensus reached that major changes were needed \u2014 and soon.\n\u201cEveryone has come to the realization that we need more partners, that we got to rebuild the movement, that we have faced all these vicious attacks,\u201d said Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which is still reeling from when Wisconsin curbed collective bargaining for most public employees in 2011. \u201cMaybe it takes a bat to your head, but people get it now. People are engaged.\u201d\nInside the convention hall, there was a sea change in rhetoric. Gone was talk about fighting for only the 11 percent of workers \u2014 bricklayers, steelworkers and seafarers \u2014 who still belong to labor unions. \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d said Richard Trumka, the A.F.L.-C.I.O\u2019s president, \u201cit\u2019s on us to build a movement not for the 99 percent but of the 99 percent. Not just the 11 percent we are right now.\u201d\nThe convention delegates also passed a resolution that sought to redefine the labor movement, showing that it is more than just union members. It stated: \u201cThe labor movement consists of all workers who want to take collective action to improve wages, hours and working conditions. Our unions must be open to all workers who want to join with us.\u201d\nThe election of Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, to the federation\u2019s executive council, was cited as another example of labor\u2019s efforts to broaden its base. She is the first official from a workers center, a nonunion group that battles for immigrant workers, to sit on the council.\nIn a move aimed at reaching out to immigrants, the delegates elected a refugee from Ethiopia, Tefere Gebre, as the labor federation\u2019s No. 3 official, its executive vice president.\nMr. Gebre, 45, who fled war in Ethiopia at the age of 14 and arrived in California the next year, won a track scholarship to college and ultimately became head of the Orange County Labor Federation. He transformed it into a political powerhouse that helped make a county famous for Richard Nixon far more Democratic.\nDozens of outside groups attended the convention, in part to lend the struggling labor movement a hand, in part to plug into the considerable power and reach that organized labor still has. There were leaders of more than a dozen immigrant worker centers, including ones from Louisiana, New York, Washington State and Texas. Numerous professors attended to share their insights, and union leaders from Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nigeria also visited.\nTerry O\u2019Neill, president of the National Organization for Women, voiced support for labor\u2019s efforts to reinvent and reinvigorate itself.\n\u201cWe have to stop telling women that they have to lean in as individuals,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to tell them there is a whole system here that you have to lean together with your brothers and sisters, we have a whole movement here to put the United States on the right track.\u201d\nSome antiunion groups were quick to criticize the A.F.L.-C.I.O.\u2019s push to reinvent itself and expand its base. J. Justin Wilson, managing director of the Center for Union Facts, a business-backed group, said labor\u2019s effort to partner with worker centers and progressive groups like the N.A.A.C.P. and the Sierra Club had \u201cmore to do with gaining national political clout than advancing the interests of individual members.\u201d\nDespite so much talk of unity here, divisions simmered close to the surface. Last month, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which represents West Coast dock workers, quit the A.F.L.-C.I.O., complaining that the federation was not paying enough attention to it and had not stopped another union from raiding it.\nTwo of the nation\u2019s largest unions \u2014 the Teamsters and the Service Employees International Union \u2014 did not attend because they quit the A.F.L.-C.I.O. eight years ago, although several other unions, including the laborers, Unite Here and the United Food and Commercial Workers, which had earlier severed ties, have rejoined.\nMany delegates said they felt inspired \u2014 but they acknowledged that spreading their energy and urgency to union officials and locals across the country might not be easy. \u201cThis is a new, energized and focused labor movement \u2014 it has a more youthful energy,\u201d said Ms. Desai of the taxi workers\u2019 alliance. \u201cBut my concern is, how are we going to translate that energy to work on the ground, to spread that energy through the locals?\u201d",

    "text": "Indentured Servitude in the Persian Gulf\n2013-04-12T19:35:49.000Z\nDOHA, Qatar\nLAST year, Theresa M. Dantes signed a contract with an employment agency in the Philippines to come here to work as a housemaid for $400 a month, plus room and board. But when she arrived, her employer said he would pay her only $250. She acquiesced; her family back in Quezon City depended on her earnings.\nOther surprises quickly followed. Ms. Dantes, 29, said she was fed one meal a day, leftovers from the family\u2019s lunch: \u201cIf no leftovers, I didn\u2019t eat.\u201d She worked seven days a week. When she finished work in her employer\u2019s house, she was forced to clean his mother-in-law\u2019s house, and then his sister\u2019s.\nAfter eight months, Ms. Dantes tried to leave. Her boss laughed. \u201cYou can\u2019t quit,\u201d he told her.\nUnder kafala, the system that governs the working lives of every foreigner employed in Qatar, Ms. Dantes could not resign without her employer\u2019s permission. She fled and joined 56 other women who had sought shelter at the Philippine Overseas Labor Office.\nSome 1.2 million foreign workers \u2014 mostly poor Asians from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Indonesia and the Philippines \u2014 make up 94 percent of the labor force in Qatar, an absolute monarchy roughly the size of Connecticut. \nDeveloped in the late 1950s in sparsely populated Persian Gulf states that needed workers for their oil and gas industries, the system has expanded to the point where there are nearly five foreign workers for each Qatari citizen. Perhaps a million foreign workers are expected to arrive in the next few years to help build nine new stadiums and $20 billion in roads needed by 2022, when Qatar will host the World Cup. \nMany of these workers will labor under near-feudal conditions that Human Rights Watch has likened to \u201cforced labor.\u201d Qatari employers assume legal responsibility for their employees in addition to providing them with a paid job, a work visa, housing and often food. In exchange, an employee agrees to work for an employer for a fixed length of time. \nBut a worker cannot change jobs, leave the country, get a driver\u2019s license, rent a home or open a checking account without the permission of his or her employer-sponsor, or kafeel. And a kafeel also can withdraw sponsorship at almost any time and send the employee home.\nIt\u2019s not just housemaids and other low-skilled workers who are the victims. An Arab-American businessman, Nasser Beydoun, said he spent 685 days as an \u201ceconomic hostage\u201d in Doha before he was released in October 2011. After he quit as chief executive of a local restaurant chain, his former employer denied him a permit to leave Qatar. \n\u201cForeign workers in Qatar are modern-day slaves to their local employers,\u201d Mr. Beydoun, who now lives in Detroit, told me. \u201cThe local Qatari owns you.\u201d\nOnly about half of foreign blue-collar workers sign formal work contracts before coming to Qatar, according to a poll by the Social and Economic Survey Research Institute at Qatar University. The rest come with nothing more than a verbal agreement.\nEven a formal contract offers inadequate protection. A quarter of the blue-collar workers who signed contracts said employers failed to fully honor the agreements, the poll found. That proportion increased to 42 percent among the third who made less than $275 a month. \nUnder pressure from human rights and labor advocates, the government has promised new protections. \u201cSeven, eight years ago we didn\u2019t have labor laws,\u201d said Hussein al-Mulla, under secretary of the Labor Ministry. \u201cIt is better now than before. It will be better in the future.\u201d\nThe \u00a0ministry has created a phone line for workers to anonymously report abuses, and a system of arbitrating labor disputes. Employers now must report paycheck details to the Labor Ministry. The country is finalizing a law setting occupational health and safety standards and a charter of workers\u2019 rights. \nBut new laws are not enough. \u201cThe challenge is enforcement of these laws and establishing a new work culture,\u201d\u00a0 Andrew Gardner, an anthropologist at the University of Puget Sound who studies gulf laborers, told me. \u201cThe scope of the problem is so large and the number of foreigners is growing so quickly.\u201d\nMost construction workers, security guards, household staffers and service workers come to Qatar through personnel agencies, which are hired by prospective employers and draw up the contracts. Officials in some sending countries are supposed to review the contract before they issue exit visas. \nThe average recruiting fee for a blue-collar worker, according to the poll, is almost $1,000 for a job that typically pays about $470 a month. Most workers have to borrow to pay the fee. Among workers earning $275 or less, 80 percent take at least three months just to earn back their recruiting fee; nearly a third take six months or longer. \nForeign workers in Qatar, which has no minimum-wage law, have little recourse if they are offered wages lower than they expected, and the high fees the personnel agencies charge give employers no incentive to free their employees from their obligations.\nRemarkably, some migrant workers help circumvent the very laws intended to protect them. Francisco Moceros, 50, a driver-for-hire here, said he signed a work contract for $340 a month \u2014 the Philippine government\u2019s minimum \u2014 at an employment agency in Manila, but is paid $220. The recruiter said the listed salary was a sham, Mr. Moceros said, but he signed anyway. \nQatar\u2019s 250,000 citizens are among the world\u2019s richest, with a gross national income (adjusted for relative purchasing power) of $87,478 last year \u2014 about double the figure in the United States.\nThe typical household is served by a staff of three. Some 95 percent of Qatari families employ a housemaid; more than half have two or more. A recent survey by the research institute found that nearly 9 in 10 Qataris did not want to see the kafala system weakened; if anything, 30 percent said they wanted to see employers\u2019 prerogatives strengthened.\nThis means that reform efforts \u201cmust go slowly,\u201d Mr. Mulla, of the Labor Ministry, told me. In 2009, neighboring Bahrain allowed foreign workers to freely change jobs. Mr. Mulla agrees that the Qatari system must change: \u00a0\u201cIt will be better \u2014 or it will be history.\u201d \nUntil it does get better, indentured servitude on the Persian Gulf will live on.",

    "text": "Myanmar\u2019s Muslim Minority Confronts Fear and Mistrust\n2013-07-03T01:19:46.000Z\nYANGON, Myanmar \u2014 Night can be very dark in Yangon, a city where street lamps, when there are any, flicker on and off with the uneven electricity supply. For a group of Muslim men guarding their neighborhood until dawn, it is never clear what is lurking down the potholed roads and alleyways.\n\u201cThe government cannot guarantee our safety,\u201d said U Nyi Nyi, a businessman who sat on a plastic chair with a half-dozen of the 130 men he has organized for an improvised Muslim neighborhood watch program.\nAfter decades of peaceful coexistence with the Buddhist majority in the country, Muslims say they now constantly fear the next attack. Over the past year, they say several violent episodes across the country led by rampaging Buddhist mobs have taught them that if violence comes to their neighborhood, they are on their own.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the police will protect us,\u201d Mr. Nyi Nyi said.\nThe neighborhood watch program, a motley corps of men who check for any suspicious outsiders and keep wooden clubs and metal rods stashed nearby, is a symbol of how much relations have deteriorated between Buddhists and Muslims in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma.\nAbout 90 percent of the country\u2019s population of 55 million is Buddhist, with Muslims making up 4 to 8 percent.\nSince British colonial days, Yangon, formerly Rangoon, has been a multicultural city where Buddhists live cheek by jowl with Muslims, Christians and Hindus. Mosques and Buddhist pagodas are literally in each other\u2019s shadows.\nNow fear and suspicion taint dealings between the two communities, Muslims say.\n\u201cWe are losing trust with each other,\u201d said U Aye, a Muslim used-car salesman. \u201cAny business transaction between a Buddhist and a Muslim can turn into an incident.\u201d\nThe root of the violence, which has left around 200 Muslims dead over the past year, appears partly a legacy of colonial years when Indians, many of them Muslims, arrived in the country as civil servants and soldiers, stirring resentment among Burmese Buddhists. In recent months radical monks have since built on those historic grievances, fanning fears that Muslims are having more children than Buddhists and could dilute the country\u2019s Buddhist character.\nSo far, Yangon, which is by far the country\u2019s largest city, has mainly escaped the violence. But there have been some minor clashes in the city that intensified worries here, fueling rumors about pending attacks in both the Buddhist and Muslim communities. \nDays after Buddhist mobs tore through the central city of Meiktila in March, two trucks filled with men showed up in Mr. Nyi Nyi\u2019s neighborhood and hurled stones at the night watchmen with slingshots. \nSome Muslims with means have fled to Malaysia or Singapore. Muslim-owned businesses are losing Buddhist customers. A growing Buddhist movement known as 969 that has the blessing of some of the country\u2019s leaders is campaigning for a boycott of Muslim products and businesses and a ban on interfaith marriages.\nThe movement says it is not involved in violence, but critics say that, at the least, hate-filled sermons are helping to inspire the killings.\n\u201cThis is the first time we experience this in our lifetime,\u201d said U Maung Maung Myint, who runs an import-export company and is one of the trustees of the Bengali mosque, which is only a few hundred paces from a Buddhist pagoda, a Christian church and a Hindu temple. He was referring specifically to the mistrust between communities.\nAfter a lifetime of feeling that he was Burmese, Mr. Maung Maung Myint said he felt \u201cbetrayed.\u201d At least twice during the decades of military rule, Muslims joined protesters calling for political change, he said. \u201cWe marched in front of the American Embassy and chanted, \u2018We want democracy!\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \n\u201cWe hoped our lives would be more peaceful \u2014 we didn\u2019t expect this,\u201d Mr. Maung Maung Myint said in an interview after Friday Prayer on the third floor of the mosque, which installed security cameras last year to guard against arson.\nMyanmar is now ruled by a nominally civilian government, but new freedoms have amplified old animosities.\nMuch of the violence has made headlines inside the country and beyond. But smaller incidents have gone largely unreported. In one such case, a grocery store owned by U Khin Maung Htay, 59, was attacked in February by a Buddhist mob in Hlaing Thaya Township, directly across the Hlaing River from Yangon.\nMr. Khin Maung Htay was the headman of the neighborhood, and some of his Buddhist friends had warned him that trouble was brewing.\n\u201cI called police, but they said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s no problem,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Khin Maung Htay said.\nWhen the Buddhist mob attacked, the police arrived, but left after failing to persuade the crowd to disperse, he said. Mr. Khin Maung Htay\u2019s shop was destroyed, and everything inside was looted.\nHe fled his home and is now a refugee in his own city, crammed in a two-bedroom apartment in central Yangon with 22 other relatives.\nHe tried to return to the neighborhood, he said, but angry residents, some of them former customers, shouted abuse and threatened him.\n\n8 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\n\u201cThey said: \u2018Go back to India! Go back to Bangladesh!\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Khin Maung Htay said.\nThe suggestion that Muslims leave the country has been a common refrain during the violence, which bewilders many Muslims who have always considered themselves Burmese. Mr. Khin Maung Htay, his father and his grandfather were all born in Myanmar.\nMyanmar\u2019s Muslims are a diverse collection of ethnicities and appearances. In some families, women wear head scarves and men grow out their beards. But many say they have made an effort to blend into Burmese society.\n\u201cWe have a Myanmar lifestyle,\u201d said U Maung Maung Myint, the owner of a desktop publishing business who is not related to the head of the import-export business. \u201cWe are Myanmar citizens. We went to Myanmar schools.\u201d\nNinety percent of his customers were Buddhists, but early this year many of them stopped coming. It was the first time he had felt discrimination, he said.\nBuddhists in Myanmar are often candid about their dislike for Muslims. \nU Soe Nyi Nyi, the owner of a successful restaurant business that includes the flagship brand Feel, a popular chain in Yangon, said he generally avoided hiring Muslims because \u201cthere are so many differences \u2014 their attitude, their manners, their behavior.\u201d\nAmong his 1,800 employees are only two Muslims, a parking attendant and a man who makes a type of Indian ice cream.\nIn real estate, Buddhist building owners do not want to sell apartments to Muslims, Mr. Soe Nyi Nyi said, adding, \u201cIf you sell one apartment to a Muslim family, all the prices in the building will go down. \u201d \nU Myint Thein, who owns a business selling cooking-gas stoves imported from India, said he found it difficult to explain the violence to his children.\n\u201cI did my best to make sure they didn\u2019t hear about these horrible things, but they heard,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought about leaving this country before. But I don\u2019t want my kids to live through more of this.\u201d",

    "text": "Czech Politician Faces Claims of Aiding Secret Police\n2013-11-13T00:41:01.000Z\nPARIS \u2014 Andrej Babis, a populist billionaire who handed out doughnuts to voters at subway stations, emerged as a surprise kingmaker in the recent Czech elections by fashioning himself as a self-made outsider who would stamp out corruption and sleaze.\nBut now Mr. Babis, 59, a blunt-spoken Slovak food, media and chemicals mogul with a Czech passport and properties in the French Riviera, is being forced to grapple with a murky past. Prague, the Czech capital, is buzzing with talk of secret files code-named \u201cSoldier\u201d and \u201cEye\u201d that purport to expose him as a Communist-era secret police agent, an allegation he denies.\nThe center-left Social Democrats scraped together a slim victory in parliamentary elections held last month after a spying and bribery scandal. But by many accounts, the real winners were Mr. Babis and his anti-establishment party, Ano, or Yes. The party\u2019s second-place showing, with about 19 percent of the vote \u2014 not far behind the Social Democrats, who had about 20.5 percent \u2014 makes it indispensable in creating a coalition government. Mr. Babis, who won a seat in Parliament himself, is being mentioned as a possible prime minister or finance minister.\nYet, in a region where history is close to the surface, Mr. Babis\u2019s dizzying rise has been clouded by allegations from the Nation\u2019s Memory Institute, based in Slovakia, that he worked in the 1980s for the reviled Czechoslovak secret police, the StB. Czechoslovakia split 20 years ago into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Today, Czechs who collaborated with the secret police can be barred from holding public office.\nIt is a reflection of many Czechs\u2019 ambivalence about their own collaboration with the Communist government that the details of Mr. Babis\u2019s files that emerged during the campaign did not stop his party from doing well. But if he is blocked from joining a future administration or decides to remain on the sidelines, the country could emerge with a minority government, worsening its political instability.\nAlready, the allegations are unsettling some in Ano\u2019s ranks. In a report published on Tuesday, Ivan Pilny, a senior party figure, threatened to resign if Mr. Babis turned out to have been a secret police agent. \u201cIf we are presented with proof that Mr. Babis collaborated with the StB, I would have to leave the party, as that would mean he lied to us,\u201d Mr. Pilny told Mlada Fronta Dnes, a leading Czech news outlet.\nAccording to previously classified documents released by the Nation\u2019s Memory Institute, Mr. Babis was registered as an informant in 1980 and became an agent two years later. His code name was Bures, a common Czechoslovak surname. The files describe how Mr. Babis, who then worked for a state foreign trade company dealing in chemicals, purportedly met with secret police handlers in 1982 at a bar in Bratislava, now the capital of Slovakia. Later, the \u201cSoldier\u201d file says, they met at least 17 times. The \u201cEye\u201d file lists two reports Mr. Babis is said to have sent to a colleague, without giving details.\nIn a telephone interview from Prague, Mr. Babis denied the accusations, saying he had been summoned to meet with the secret police at most three times and had never joined their ranks. He said the files were forgeries made by the StB to blackmail him, in part because some of his family members had affronted the government by emigrating.\nAt the time, he said, the state wanted to import phosphates from Syria and he refused because the materials posed a health hazard, making him a target of official ire. He has taken the Slovak institute to court and demanded that he be removed from the list of collaborators. A hearing is scheduled for January.\n\u201cIt is nonsense,\u201d Mr. Babis said. \u201cI never signed anything. I was a victim. I never did anything wrong to anyone.\u201d\nHe added that he was not proud of having been a member of the Communist Party, but that he had joined at his mother\u2019s urging, out of economic pragmatism. \u201cI was young; I did stupid things,\u201d he said, noting that only a minority of Czechoslovaks had the courage to be dissidents. \u201cTo get by, you had to cooperate.\u201d\nTomas Bursik, a historian at the archives of the security services in Prague, noted that a large portion of Mr. Babis\u2019s files had been destroyed, and that what remained did not contain any examples of his handwriting or signature. \u201cThis all reminds me of a witch hunt,\u201d Mr. Bursik said.\nBridling at comparisons to Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister of Italy, Mr. Babis said his role model of a billionaire-turned-politician was New York\u2019s departing mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg. \u201cI am happily with one woman, I combat corruption, I pay a lot of taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cAny comparisons with Berlusconi are a load of nonsense.\u201d\nEarlier this year, a few days after he acquired the Mafra publishing house, Mr. Babis came under fire for making an angry phone call to a reporter at Lidove Noviny, one of the company\u2019s newspapers, who had not written about his news conference. He has also been criticized for using his wealth to influence the election, pumping more than $1.6 million into his campaign, according to his party\u2019s website. (Czech law does not limit how much of their own money candidates may spend on their campaigns.)\nFed up by accusations of having undue influence, he said he planned to take Mafra and his future media acquisitions public and become a minority shareholder.\nJan Richter, a journalist at Radio Prague who covered Mr. Babis\u2019s campaign, praised his common touch but said he was now being forced to reckon with past compromises. \u201cMany Czechs voted for him out of desperation, trusting his promise that he would run the country like a company,\u201d Mr. Richter said. \u201cI think they overlooked his controversial past and also underestimated the risk of him pursuing his own business interests.\u201d\nBorn in present-day Slovakia to a diplomat father who worked in foreign trade, Mr. Babis grew up in Bratislava, Geneva and Paris. His net worth is estimated at $2 billion, and he was ranked 736th this year on Forbes\u2019s list of the world\u2019s billionaires.\nMr. Babis, who studied economics, recalled that he started making money at 9 years old, collecting tennis balls at a club in Bratislava. After Czechoslovakia split in 1993, he said, he used $5,400 to start Agrofert, a fertilizer firm. Today, Agrofert is a sprawling conglomerate.\nKnown as a tough negotiator, he attributed his success to a combination of financing and luck. But others said his past membership in the Communist elite had allowed him to gain experience and contacts abroad at a time when most Czechoslovaks could not leave the country.\nMr. Babis said his upbringing had advantages. \u201cI was neither Paris Hilton nor a poor kid in Bangladesh,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my mother spoke six languages, and my parents were outward-looking, and this was a huge advantage after Communism fell.\u201d\nIn a sign of disillusionment with the post-Communist order, the new power broker of Czech politics does not try to conceal his contempt for the political class.\n\u201cPoliticians are people who have not succeeded in life \u2014 they have never worked, they have never performed, they lie,\u201d he said. \u201cIn business, if you lie, you are finished.\u201d",

    "text": "Is It Crazy to Think We Can Eradicate Poverty?\n2013-04-30T09:00:08.000Z\nAt a news conference during the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in late April, Jim Yong Kim held up a piece of paper with the year \u201c2030\u201d scribbled on it in pen. \u201cThis is it,\u201d said Kim, the genial American physician who took over as president of the World Bank last summer. \u201cThis is the global target to end poverty.\u201d\nIt sounds like the sort of airy, ambitious goal that is greeted by standing ovations but is ultimately unlikely to ever materialize. Development experts don\u2019t see it that way, though. The end of extreme poverty might very well be within reach. \u201cIt\u2019s not by any means pie-in-the-sky,\u201d says Scott Morris, who formerly managed the Obama administration\u2019s relations with development institutions. When I asked Jeffrey Sachs, the development economist, if the target seemed feasible, he said, \u201cI absolutely believe so.\u201d And Nancy Birdsall, president of the Center for Global Development, the powerful Washington policy group, told me, \u201cIn many ways, it\u2019s a very modest goal.\u201d\nIn part, this is because the bar is set very low. The World Bank aims to raise just about everyone on Earth above the $1.25-a-day income threshold. In Zambia, an average person living in such dire poverty might be able to afford, on a given day, two or three plates of cornmeal porridge, a tomato, a mango, a spoonful each of oil and sugar, a bit of chicken or fish, maybe a handful of nuts. But he would have just pocket change to spend on transportation, housing, education and everything else. The 1.2 billion people living in such extreme poverty, according to researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, might own land, but they are not very likely to own durable goods or productive assets \u2014 things like bicycles \u2014 that might help them raise themselves out of poverty. In such families, about half or three-quarters of income goes toward food.\nFortunately, this deadly and cyclical form of poverty is already on its way toward obsolescence, and much faster than many development economists expected. The first Millennium Development Goal \u2014 to halve the proportion of the world population living in dire poverty by 2015 \u2014 was met five years early, as the rate fell to an estimated 21 percent in 2010, from 43 percent in 1990. Some economists had feared that the recession would arrest or even reverse the trend, given how interconnected the global economy is, but the improvement continued, unabated. Annual growth dipped for developing economies in 2009 but has since rebounded to about 5.3 percent a year, a figure dragged down by weaker peripheral European economies.\nFor much of the improvement, the world can thank one country: China, which alone accounts for about half of the decline in the extreme poverty rate worldwide. It has also driven significant gains across the region. In the early 1980s, East Asia had the highest extreme-poverty rate in the world, with more than three in four people living on less than $1.25 a day. By 2010, just one in eight were. But other middle-income countries, like Brazil, Nigeria and India, have experienced significant growth, too \u2014 in no small part because tens of millions of the very poor have moved from rural areas to cities, where they become richer, healthier and more productive for their economies.\nSince 1980, the proportion of the developing world living in urban areas has grown to about 50 percent, from 30 percent, and according to the World Bank, that migration of hundreds of millions has been instrumental in pulling down poverty rates \u2014 and will be for a broader set of countries going forward. Cities bolster access to health services and public resources; infant-mortality rates, for instance, are 40 percent lower in urban Cambodia than in rural Cambodia. And workers themselves become more productive, often by making the switch from labor-intensive work like farming to capital-intensive work like manufacturing. Urban poverty is hardly attractive \u2014 slums are cramped, unplanned, unhygienic places \u2014 but it is, in many cases, less deadly. (Except when it\u2019s not. A recent factory collapse in Bangladesh killed dozens of workers \u2014 a reminder of the sometimes-catastrophic human costs associated with rapid, unchecked urbanization and industrialization.)\nSocial assistance has also improved in many middle-income countries and a number of low-income ones as well. In the past decade, for instance, Brazil and Mexico have pushed down their poverty rates in part by simply giving money to the poor \u2014 making direct transfers, as economists call it \u2014 and India is trying the same. Lant Pritchett of Harvard Kennedy School, a former World Bank economist, notes that by this logic, the world could eliminate extreme poverty for about $45 billion a year, or roughly the amount spent on movie tickets annually worldwide.\nOf course, making it above the $1.25-a-day mark doesn\u2019t guarantee a white picket fence and a Caddy in the driveway \u2014 indeed it doesn\u2019t even guarantee a proper meal. For that reason, some economists have criticized the bank for setting its targets too low. \u201cIt\u2019s small,\u201d Pritchett says. \u201cIt\u2019s penurious. It\u2019s charity-like. It\u2019s not development.\u201d He says that the billions who live on a bit more than $1.25 a day are still deeply impoverished by any reasonable standard. \u201cWhy are we focused on a line, above which nothing happens, set by some technocrats in Washington?\u201d Another 1.2 billion live on between $1.25 and $2 a day, an only slightly less dire form of deprivation.\nFor the poor living in poor countries, particularly the profoundly unstable ones, gains have been harder-fought and slower, a trend that the World Bank\u2019s own economists describe as worrisome. But that is not to play down the successes so far. In 2008, for the first time since the bank started measuring the statistics, the number of people living in dire poverty and the dire-poverty rate fell in every region around the world. Extreme poverty in sub-Saharan Africa has at last dipped below the 50 percent mark. Still, many within the development world doubt the ability of NGOs to cure the world\u2019s most troubled nations of their woes. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have a recipe for fixing the Congo or South Sudan or Afghanistan,\u201d says Birdsall, of the Center for Global Development.\nIn an interview, Kim sounded energetic and optimistic about the prospect that the great brute force of growth would keep on lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty \u2014 and about the bank\u2019s role in nursing the process along. Given how big the world is, how big the goal is and how diverse economies are, it would take a multipronged approach, he said. For parts of sub-Saharan Africa, it would mean huge electrification projects. For China, it would mean smarter urbanization and clean energy. For India, it would mean enormous infrastructure investments that the World Bank could help finance. It also might mean replicating what has worked for those big, quick-growing emerging economies in poorer, poverty-stricken developing ones.\nMore slums \u2014 as horrible as they are \u2014 could be a good thing.\nBack in Washington, while Kim delivered a sunny forecast for the developing world based on the premise that growth would continue, his counterpart at the I.M.F., Christine Lagarde, seemed stuck talking about problems \u2014 in particular, the economic malaise of the richest countries on Earth. Would the Bank of Japan\u2019s plan to end deflation by bathing the economy in yen work? Would Congress delay some of the sequester cuts? Might Germany cool it with the austerity? Call them first-world problems if you like. They are, but they do tend to find their way into the streets of Hyderabad, Accra and Lima. \u201cThe developing world has gotten its act together,\u201d Birdsall says. But poverty reduction \u201cdepends on the advanced economies getting their act together, too.\u201d",

    "text": "Fashion Remains a Bellwether for Modernity\n2013-10-14T22:46:05.000Z\nWe have all read \u2014 often in excerpts from serious scientific journals \u2014 about revolutionary clothing concepts: the \u201cwellness\u201d jacket impregnated with herbal treatments; the outfit that changes color with body heat as a hazard warning; the boots that adapt to any foot size.\nYet fashionable shop windows and online offerings look suspiciously familiar: new, perhaps, in the mix of colors, especially with digitized patterns, or in ever-lighter stretch fabrics, but so far nothing to project fashion into a futuristic era.\nBehind the apparent \u201csameness\u201d of what was once defined by \u201cnew-ness,\u201d however, fashion is changing drastically. Where once the products were designed for an elite, \u201cfashion\u201d is now out there for everyone, at every price.\nYou want shorts (for either sex), and there they are, in reptile skin with a designer label and an eye-watering price tag, or in denim (of course) for next to nothing. They also come in cotton, silk, linen, in a variety of lengths, patterned or plain. Yours for the picking.\n\u201cThere is such a thing as fashion today,\u201d says Tom Ford, \u201cbut it is everywhere and everything. Every kind of shoe with a high heel, flat, platform. So much, too much!\u201d\nIf fashion is for everyone and about everything in every possible shape and at every conceivable price, from Moscow to Shanghai, what does it mean to be fashionable?\nWell, we live in an era of \u201cpeople\u2019s choice.\u201d With a billion selfies being pinged via Instagram or other means across cities and continents, there is a group mentality operating. The constantly changing \u201cleaders\u201d in the blogosphere set rules, with followers then absorbing, rejecting or reformulating their endorsements or harsh judgements.\nWith fashion shows live-streamed, viewers can talk about them via social media before any reviews by fashion critics or other institutional commentators have appeared.\nGeoffroy de la Bourdonnaye, the chief executive of the Paris-based Chlo\u00e9, part of the Richemont group, says that the idea of an outfit or even a brand being \u201cin\u201d or \u201cout\u201d according to the whims of bloggers is tough to swallow for fashion companies, especially those with a long heritage, well-orchestrated publicity campaigns and stores around the world.\nFor an established brand, this switch in fashion influence to a form of \u201ccrowd critique\u201d is more striking than a dramatic change of style, like a return of the floor-sweeping maxi.\n\u201cYou know instantly\u201d if something is a hit or a flop, Mr. de la Bourdonnaye says. \u201cThe online response is very quick. These are spontaneous reactions from people who are not fashion experts. But people are becoming more and more educated. And everyone is everywhere.\u201d\nHe might have added that an \u201cit\u201d bag can be turned into a \u201chit\u201d bag by the judicious placing of products with bloggers (just as magazine editors have traditionally been showered with gifts from the fashion companies). Since the bloggers proudly present themselves online with the new trophy, this is hardly a secret.\nKen Downing, the fashion director at Neiman Marcus, believes he has seen the beginning of a negative reaction to the blogosphere, citing the greed of some newly arrived bloggers. Yet the sheer amount of fashion words and images out there has had one definite effect for fashion companies: the need to constantly press the refresh button.\nStella McCartney says it is impossible to send out a collection based on a single look, because each woman has many facets.\nAlber Elbaz, the creative director of Lanvin, says he marvels that fashion icons of the past, like Coco Chanel with her tweeds and pearls or Madame Gr\u00e8s and her draped cloth, followed the same path all their fashion lives.\nNot only does Mr. Elbaz present shows with markedly different offerings \u2014 mannish tailoring and floaty dresses, discreet colors and bold glamour \u2014 but, like all designers, he also has to produce a constant stream of new ideas outside the main runway shows.\nWhy does there have to be so much fashion in the 21st century, at a time when people pay lip service to ideas of sustainability and recycling, to \u201cgreen\u201d fashion backed by celebrities like Livia Firth?\nAnd despite the wide media coverage and the shocking images of building collapses and fires in Bangladesh garment factories, where workers are paid a pittance to produce the latest fashions in hazardous conditions, nothing seems to have reduced consumer demand for cheap clothes that instantly imitate designer looks.\nMr. Elbaz is concerned that fast fashion, the fading of multibrand stores and the rise of luxury conglomerates are affecting the very essence of fashion.\n\u201cFashion is changing; power is taking over from strength,\u201d he says. \u201cFashion used to be a family, and family is about being strong. Money is about being powerful, and I think there is too much power. People go to stores and they have been brainwashed about what to buy, not necessarily because they love the product. There are too many collections, too many seasons. Maybe that is where we need change.\u201d\nWhile the luxury groups have all moved into retailing over the past 20 years, department stores have also taken up the challenge of high-end competition and the fast-fashion offerings on Main Street.\nMarigay McKee, who is poised to become the next president of Saks Fifth Avenue after 15 years as chief merchant, or fashion director, at Harrods in London, has lived through the change of speed.\n\u201cWhen thinking about a new brand, you have to think about brand equity, not just today but tomorrow and in the next year or five years,\u201d she says, citing the need to project growth areas for clothing or accessories and attempt to spot winners, like C\u00e9line and the Tom Ford label, two brands that grew spectacularly at Harrods over three years.\n\u201cWe are also looking at social media as an opportunity,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd how do we do fusion between bricks-and-mortar and online? How do you stay relevant? I think relevance is the key.\u201d\nOne of the overall reasons for the growth of fashion sales in shops and online has simply been the increasingly large range of products from the major brands. Thirty years ago, Mr. de la Bourdonnaye points out, some designers made only clothes while others specialized in shoes, bags or hats.\nSince the 1990s, however, the boot has been on the other foot, metaphorically and literally, with Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Prada stretching their expertise from accessories to clothes.\nThe need to constantly refresh also applies to young designers, who are no longer tapped just to divvy up existing brands, like Alexander Wang at Balenciaga or J.W. Anderson\u2019s one-season-only collection for Versace\u2019s Versus line.\nInvestment from the luxury conglomerates to back some of those young designers is part of the trend. For example, Kering (formerly PPR) backs Joseph Altuzarra, based in the United States, and Christopher Kane of Britain, while LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton is circling the former Balenciaga designer Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re.\nWhy does the future of fashion remain a guessing game? Perhaps because the effects of today\u2019s rapidly evolving technology, like the transformations brought by the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, are simply unfathomable.\nWill the next decade produce an internationally known designer crowdsourced over the Internet? Will Asian designers come into full flower in their own countries and no longer be scattered across the fashion world, like the \u201cABC\u2019s,\u201d as American-born Chinese are known?\nEven more difficult to predict is whether science and technology will play an active role in creating fashion rather than just creating instant reaction.\nMost designers remain skeptical about whether computers can actually \u201ccreate\u201d fabric patterns as opposed to the way they can help weave knitwear, for example.\nThe plastics fantastic that seduced the legendary magazine editor Diana Vreeland in the 1930s \u2014 but literally vanished into thin air at the dry cleaner \u2014 have left a shadow on the psyche.\nIs the future of fashion design in the laboratory? In some kind of production cyberspace? In traditional stores or yet-undiscovered venues? Whatever the answers, fashion will remain a bellwether for modernity and a mirror of its (future) time.",

    "text": "Manufacture New York Provides Production Facilities to Independent Designers\n2013-10-09T20:29:03.000Z\nAlmost a year to the day since she began pitching the idea for Manufacture New York, a work hive for independent designers with outposts in Brooklyn and Manhattan, Bob Bland was on the verge of opening the doors to the first iteration of her vision. \u201cWe gut-renovated this space with our bare hands,\u201d she said one afternoon last month, casting her gaze over a 2,000-square-foot space at 23 West 36th Street that she is branding the Garment Center Pilot Program. \u201cAlthough now I hear they\u2019re rebranding as the garment district, which means we\u2019ll have to redo all our branding.\u201d \nThis represents a minor hiccup for Ms. Bland, 30, who has been rallying support and financing for an idea she said, \u201ccame to me fully formed, almost as a dream.\u201d The garment district space will be dwarfed by the 160,000-square-foot clothing design and production center she is planning to open in 2014, in an industrial lot, Industry City, in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, that also houses artists\u2019 studios, a microbrewery and the fashion label Rag & Bone (one of whose investors, the Theory chief executive Andrew Rosen, has also been of late carrying out plans to encourage local manufacturing with the Council of Fashion Designers of America).\nMs. Bland pointed out that New York\u2019s garment manufacturing industry has seen a 90 percent decrease in jobs since the early 1990s and said the main motivation behind Manufacture New York \u201cis to provide talented, hard-working designers with the resources they need to make a living doing what they love.\u201d She said both facilities were \u201ca culmination of my entire career in fashion, both as a corporate and an independent designer.\u201d\n\u201cI was sick of hearing about small labels going bust,\u201d she said, \u201cand also very aware of the difficulties in keeping an ethical global supply chain.\u201d\nJessica Lapidos of Tilly and William, a unisex label, was one of the first of some 40-odd designers who have already signed up, pleased by the promise of technology \u201ctypically accessible solely to big businesses,\u201d she said, like pattern-making software, photo-studio space and sales representation. \u201cThey\u2019re responding to the challenges of being a designer from every angle,\" she said. \nMs. Bland said she would be able to accommodate up to 70 designers, charging them a monthly membership fee of $275 for access to design space alongside high-quality production facilities. \u201cWe want to unite the two,\u201d she said, adding with a note of sarcasm, \u201cHow radical!\u201d\nMs. Bland, who has worked on the design floor at labels including Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren, indeed sounds like a woman radicalized. \u201cOutsourcing production overseas used to seem like a magic solution when it came to producing affordable product for a thrifty, trend-driven consumer,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what are the actual costs?\u201d \nShe described a Chinese factory she visited while working for Triple Five Soul, a streetwear label. \u201cIt was by no means a sweatshop, and was compliant with all the regulations on working conditions,\u201d Ms. Bland said; still, teenage laborers lived in barrack-like dormitory accommodations and regularly worked 12-hour shifts. \nThe collapse of Rana Plaza in Bangladesh last April, causing more than 1,000 deaths, made addressing the issue seem even more urgent.\nThe daughter of two public schoolteachers, Ms. Bland was born in Washington. She attended the Savannah College of Art and Design and moved to Manhattan in 2003 to pursue a design career, before settling in Williamsburg two years later. She was quickly inspired by the flourishing creative entrepreneurialism there to set up her own label, Brooklyn Royalty, in 2006. \u201cI had already grown tired of designing quality merchandise extolling the virtues of New York City, only to have it produced overseas,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the reality is, it\u2019s become almost impossible to produce a line here.\u201d \nStill, in what was then her day job at Ralph Lauren, \u201cit seemed crazy to me that the only way to see the end product of my designs was to go into the store and buy it,\u201d Ms. Bland said, adding that while there aren\u2019t enough corporate jobs available to design-school graduates, \u201cthe vast majority of what we\u2019re taught is geared toward us working for somebody else.\u201d (She conceded that she had drawn many of her ideas from powerful conglomerates like Jones Group and LVMH, \u201cwho share vast resources among many brands, from marketing to sales, sourcing and production.\u201d)\nBusiness mentoring (\u201call the stuff you should have learned in fashion school and didn\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Bland said) will also be available to designers in the Manufacture New York stable, and she is planning to help arrange paid apprenticeships with designers like Nanette Lepore and Ralph Rucci who have expressed their support for the program. \nHeather Blond, another designer who has joined Manufacture New York, said she had done so as much out of practicality as principle. \u201cAs an \u2018emerging designer,\u2019 my quantities are still very low, so I don\u2019t get to take advantage of the low overseas prices,\u201d she said. \u201cAdd on the freight and duty costs and producing in China isn\u2019t cost-saving anymore.\u201d\nMs. Bland said design talent was being vetted on experience over aesthetic. \u201cThey need to have at least established a brand, with some sales and a proven customer base,\u201d she said. \u201cThat way they\u2019ll have a strong enough foundation for us to build on and help them take it to the next level.\u201d \nBut unlike the CFDA\u2019s recently established incubator fund, which seems to be aimed at more established names, Manufacture New York is committed to providing support at a grass-roots level, she said, adding: \u201cAnd if a more built-out designer comes to me wanting to reshore their product, I\u2019m happy to help with that, too.\u201d\nHer staff of eight includes a chief operating officer and chief financial officer, Nelis Parts, a former\u00a0adviser on mergers and acquisitions in the investment banking division of Goldman Sachs; and a director of designer relations, Seth Friedermann, previously the managing editor of ModaCycle, an online fashion magazine.\nTheir first crowd-financing effort was put on hold when Ms. Bland downed tools on the project to focus on helping Restore Red Hook after Hurricane Sandy (\u201cI raised $5,000 making T-shirts,\u201d she said), but an Indiegogo.com campaign has since netted more than $40,000.\nA further $20,000 came from the fiscal sponsor Fractured Atlas, through which they are accepting tax-deductible donations, while the majority of these funds have been spent leasing and building out the space at Industry City. \u201cWe have been soliciting offers for donated production equipment since October last year,\u201d Ms. Bland said. \u201cAs beautiful as shiny new equipment is, we also want to show that with proper maintenance, good industrial equipment lasts for decades.\u201d\nMore recently, Ms. Bland has been soliciting grants from city officials. \u201cWe\u2019re working closely with people like Congresswoman Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of what we\u2019re pursuing right now is 2014 money, but there\u2019s a lot available for incubators and domestic manufacturing.\u201d \nA newly forged partnership with Johnny\u2019s Fashion Studio on 38th Street, a sample development and apparel-manufacturing firm with a client list that includes Helmut Lang, Theory and Alexander Wang, was another coup. \u201cJohnny Kim has been in business in the garment center for 30 years, and shares our vision for educating independent designers and reshoring production in the United States,\u201d she said. (Johnny\u2019s currently outsources larger production runs to China, Vietnam and Korea.) \nAnd two blocks south at the Pilot Program, business is bustling, if not yet exactly booming. \u201cWe staged a full runway show during Fashion Week, have been running classes and producing samples in-house,\u201d Ms. Bland said proudly. And where there may still be a way to go before the project is complete, she said, \u201cwe\u2019re used to working from the ground up, helping people as much as we can with the resources we\u2019ve got.\u201d",

    "text": "12 Minutes of Freedom in 460 Days of Captivity\n2013-08-28T09:00:19.000Z\nWhen I describe what happened to me on Aug. 23, 2008, I say that I was taken. On an empty stretch of road outside of Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, out of the back seat of a four-wheel-drive Mitsubishi by a dozen or so men whose faces were swaddled in checkered scarves. Each one of them carried an AK-47.\nThe truth of it dawned slowly on me, as the men seemed to rise up out of the sand, circling the car with their guns hefted, as they shouted a few words at our driver, as someone tugged open a door. We \u2014 me, my traveling companion Nigel Brennan and the three Somali men helping us with our work \u2014 were headed that day to a sprawling settlement just outside the city to do some reporting. We were waved out from our air-conditioned vehicle into the sweltering equatorial heat. I remember in that instant a narrow-shouldered woman dressed in a flowing hijab hurrying past on foot. She pointedly looked away, as if a couple of white Westerners getting pulled from a car and being forced to lie spread-eagle in the ditch at the side of the road were an everyday occurrence or, in any event, something she had no power to stop.\nIt was clear to me then that nobody was going to call for help. Nobody was going to punch some sort of reverse button so that we would be pulled to our feet, put back into our car and sent spinning down the road to where we had started. No, with every second that passed, the way back was becoming more obscure. It was hot, the air tasting like cinder. We were lying on some sort of edge. I pressed my forehead into the dirt, closed my eyes and waited for whatever was coming.\nThis is how one life ends and another one begins. In the eyes of my family and friends, in the eyes of the cheerful young waiter who served me coffee and an omelet that morning at our mostly empty hotel in Mogadishu, and from the point of view of anyone who would next try to piece together the story, I vanished. And so did Nigel, who was a photographer from Australia and an ex-boyfriend of mine \u2014 who decided at the last minute to come with me on the trip and who may well spend the rest of his life regretting that he did.\nI was 27 years old. I had spent most of the last seven years traveling the world, often by myself, as a backpacker, financing extended low-budget trips with stints working as a waitress in a couple of fancy cocktail lounges at home in Canada, in the oil-rich city of Calgary. With my saved-up tip money, I went through Venezuela, then Burma, then Bangladesh. I saw Pakistan and Syria, Ethiopia and Sudan. Each trip bolstered my confidence, convincing me that even while strife and terror hogged the international headlines, there was always something more hopeful and humane to be found on the ground.\nBefore going to Somalia, I spent the last year or so trying to transition to more serious work, learning photography and teaching myself how to produce a television report, locating myself \u2014 as many aspiring journalists did \u2014 strategically in the world\u2019s hot spots. I did a six-month stint in Kabul, followed by seven months in Baghdad. As a freelancer, I filed stories for a couple of English-language cable networks, taking whatever work I could get, and was writing a regular column for my small hometown paper in Alberta. I was getting by, but just barely. My plan was to spend a week in Somalia, which, with its civil war and what seemed to be an impending famine, had no shortage of potential stories to cover. Knowing it was risky, I took what felt like the necessary precautions \u2014 hiring a local fixer to arrange our logistics, paying for a pair of armed government guards to escort us around Mogadishu. For me, going to Somalia felt like a steppingstone, though I recognized it was a dangerous one.\nLater, our captors would tell us they had been watching our hotel. What happened was planned, to the extent anything like this can be planned. Guns were marshaled; a place to take us afterward was secured. As we headed northwest out of the city that day, they somehow knew Westerners were coming. Maybe it was a cousin\u2019s cousin who tipped them off. Maybe it was the sight of our freshly washed S.U.V. rental ripping around the battle-worn Old City, with its collapsed buildings and bullet-pocked walls. Most assuredly, there had been cash promised to somebody \u2014 a driver, a hotel employee, a guard \u2014 in exchange for information about where the foreigners were headed. We were ambushed just outside the city limits, at a precisely vulnerable moment, right after our government guards climbed out at a checkpoint and just before we were to meet two replacement guards a few kilometers down the road. Somebody \u2014 we don\u2019t know who \u2014 sold us out.\nAfter our car was searched that day, we were pulled from the ditch and then driven about 45 minutes through the desert, swerving off the paved road and into a brushy wilderness. My heart pounded loudly in my ears. The car \u2014 piloted by one of the masked men \u2014 dodged thorn trees and ran right over bushes, not following any sort of path. With every passing minute, I knew we were moving farther off the grid.\nOne of the three men sitting in the front seat was unmasked. He turned back, smiling in a way that gave me some hope.\n\u201cSister,\u201d he said, \u201cdon\u2019t worry, nothing will happen to you. There is no problem here. Inshallah.\u201d God willing, it meant. He added: \u201cOur commander would like to ask you some questions. We are taking you to our base. We think maybe you are spies.\u201d\nI could feel the fear spike in my throat. I tried to keep talking. I started babbling, listing off every Islamic country I had been to, as if that made me more of an insider.\nThe man ignored me. We drove on. Eventually, we pulled into a walled compound and were put in a darkened room inside a low, tin-roofed building. The Somali men with whom we were traveling \u2014 our cameraman, driver and a representative from the displaced-persons camp we were hoping to visit \u2014 arrived in a different vehicle and were installed in a nearby room.\nNigel and I sat glumly on two foul-smelling foam mattresses on the floor, our shoulders pressed against the dirty walls. We whispered in low voices, wondering what was happening: Was this a robbery? Did they really think we were spies? Some part of me believed that we had just overstepped our boundaries as foreigners, that we would receive some sort of militiaman reprimand and be sent back down the road. Outside, I could see a cooking area underneath a lean-to made from scrap wood and a thick tree whose branches hung heavily over the yard. In front of the house was a small outhouse. The sun radiated across the metal roof above, heating the room like an oven. Beyond our door, men were murmuring.\nA man who had earlier told us his name was Ali came into the room and demanded our money. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d he screamed. I fumbled with my backpack and produced $211 \u2014 U.S. dollars being the currency of choice in Somalia. It was all I brought for the day, having left the rest of my cash under lock and key at the Shamo Hotel (sometimes spelled Shamow), where we were staying in Mogadishu. Nigel was carrying a few coins and a folded-up hundred-dollar bill he had stashed in his front pocket.\nThe men had already confiscated our cellphones, and now Ali grabbed my bag and dumped out its contents. He inspected everything disdainfully. My camera, my notebook, my water bottle. He took the cap off my lip balm. He examined both sides of my hairbrush. He handled each item delicately, as if it might explode.\nIt wasn\u2019t until later that day, when a new man arrived, introducing himself as Adam, that it became clear they were after more money than we had in our pockets. Adam looked to be in his mid-20s, thin and serene. He wore an orange-striped polo shirt and Ben Franklin eyeglasses. He asked for the phone numbers for our families and told us that he no longer believed we were spies. \u201cAllah,\u201d he said, \u201chas put it into my heart to ask for a ransom.\u201d\nThe thought was crushing. My parents were divorced. My father had chronic health issues and lived on disability checks. My mother had a low-paying job in a bakery. My bank account was just about empty. I\u2019m not sure anybody I knew back home could even find Somalia on a map.\nNigel and I were allowed out of the room that evening, to use the bathroom and to get some air. Ali ushered us to a straw mat laid out alongside one of the compound\u2019s walls. He handed us two tins of tuna fish and a flask of tea. As darkness fell, the air cooled off somewhat. The sky became a screen, shot through with pinpricked stars. Beneath it, I felt small and lost.\nOver near the lean-to, I could see the soldier boys lolling around. They were listening to a silver battery-operated boom box that was tuned to the BBC Somali Service. A male newscaster\u2019s voice blared, speaking Somali, delivering what I assumed was news of the war. Then, with bizarre clarity, I heard him say the words \u201cShamo Hotel.\u201d\nThe words caused a stir. The soldiers were sitting up and beginning to talk. Ali waved at us excitedly, pointing toward the radio. The newscaster said \u201cCanadian\u201d and then \u201cAustralian.\u201d My eyes met Nigel\u2019s. The story was about us. The feeling was devastating. It was confirmation that our troubles were both real and deep.\nI know now that kidnappings for ransom happen more frequently than most of us would think. They happen in Mexico, Nigeria and Iraq. They happen in India, Pakistan, Algeria, China, Colombia and plenty of other places. Sometimes the motivation is political or personal, but most often it\u2019s about money. Hostage-taking is a business, a speculative one, fueled by people like me \u2014 the wandering targets, the fish out of water, the comparatively rich moving against a backdrop of poor. The stories pop up in the news and then often disappear: an American traveler is grabbed in Benin. A Dutch consultant is held for ransom in Johannesburg. A British tourist is dragged from a bus in Turkey.\nFamilies are phoned; governments are contacted. A certain machinery quietly goes into gear. Nobody would ever call these situations common, but they happen enough that there are procedures in place, a standard way things go.\nThe first call to my family from Somalia came on Aug. 24, a day after we were taken. A rumbly voice surfaced on my father\u2019s voice mail, the man named Adam saying, \u201cHello, we have your daughter.\u201d He said he would call again to talk about money and then hung up.\nBy nightfall, three agents from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (R.C.M.P.) arrived at my father\u2019s home in Sylvan Lake, several hours\u2019 drive north of Calgary, and were sitting around the dining-room table, along with my mother, who had arrived from her home in British Columbia. The agents listened several times to Adam\u2019s message. They requested permission to tap my parents\u2019 phones and offered talking points for what to say when Adam called again. When it came to money, they were to tell the truth: They had none, and the government wouldn\u2019t pay a ransom, either.\nKidnappings happened, my parents were told, but they also ended. The R.C.M.P. agents then offered a bit of hard comfort: Nigel and I were now commodities. We were worth money. If our captors killed us, it would be their loss, too.\nIn Somalia, of course, we knew none of this. The hours crawled. Our hopes sagged. A day became a week and then a month. The kidnappers moved us several times, hiding us in vacant buildings surrounded by high walls and in tucked-away desert villages, where all of us \u2014 Nigel, me, the three Somali captives, plus the eight young men and one middle-aged captain who guarded us \u2014 remained invisible. When they moved us, it was anxiously and usually in the quietest hours of night. Riding in the back seat of a Suzuki station wagon belonging to one of the group\u2019s leaders, I saw mosques and night markets strung with lights and men leading camels and groups of boisterous teenagers, some of them holding machine guns, clustered around bonfires along the road.\nEach time we arrived at a new place, the captain shuffled through his set of keys. The boys, as we called our young guards, rushed in with their guns and found a room to shut us inside. Then they staked out their places to rest, to pray, to eat. Sometimes they went outside and wrestled with one another in the yard. The leaders of the group \u2014 Adam and three other men who wore expensive clothes and spoke a polished English \u2014 all lived off-site, visiting us once or twice a week, sometimes bringing supplies.\nOur captors practiced a fundamentalist form of Islam, interpreting the words of the Koran in the most literal way possible. Most of the boys, we learned, had gone to insurgent training camps in rural areas. They were part of a loosely organized movement that was fighting their country\u2019s own faltering transitional government and Ethiopian troops, who were sent over the border in 2006 to support Somalia\u2019s attempts at democracy. They described this fight as their jihad. Nigel and I came from what they termed \u201cbad countries.\u201d We belonged to the Western world, which to them was inscrutable and immodest and ruled over by Satan. Presumably, some portion of any ransom money they got for us would go to support the larger cause.\nEvery day I worked to make myself \u2014 to make us \u2014 harder to kill, by being friendly and remaining neutral on politics. If we could bore our captors without frustrating them, I figured, maybe they would deliver us back to the Shamo, like two boxes that spent a month uselessly collecting dust in a warehouse.\nWhen the leaders weren\u2019t around, the boys often loitered nearby. The air around us hummed with what I can only describe as male energy, a buzzy mix of repression and young strength. I felt it when they came to deliver food, when their eyes fell on me and then quickly moved away, as if the sight of me, or whatever thought that followed, was shameful. A number of them seemed curious about us, though, and eager to practice what little English they knew. We spoke most often with a guard named Jamal. He sat on the floor of our room, cross-legged, in a T-shirt and a pair of tan dress slacks with cuffs that rode high over his skinny dark ankles. He was 18, a clear work in progress, with long spindly legs and narrow shoulders that sloped forward, as if he were trying to shed some of his considerable height. On his chin, he had a few sprouting hairs, the very beginnings of a beard. He told us that his father had been killed by Ethiopian soldiers. The memory of it was fresh enough that it caused his eyes to water. \u201cFor me, this was start of jihad,\u201d he said.\nBefore jihad, we learned, Adam worked as a teacher. The captain was a farmer. Before jihad, some of the younger boys went to school. Now they were paid to guard us, though it wasn\u2019t much.\nJamal was openly interested in me and Nigel, asking questions and smiling at the ground as he heard our answers. Where did we live? What did we think of Somalia? Did we own cars? He brimmed with plans for his life after the kidnapping. He was engaged to marry a girl named Hamdi. He also wanted to study information technology in India, because he had heard there were many universities there.\nHis closest friend in the house was a young man his age named Abdullah, who was more heavily built and somber. Abdullah sometimes carried in our twice-daily meals \u2014 a couple of tins of tuna, several buns, a flask of sweet tea and a mango or a few soft bananas. Unlike Jamal, he seemed stuck on the war. One day I asked him what he was going to do later in life. He gave me a fierce look, mimed the act of putting on a jacket and made the sound of an explosion.\nIt took me a second. \u201cSuicide bomber?\u201d\nAbdullah nodded. He believed that at the gates to paradise, soldiers in God\u2019s army got to enter through a special doorway.\nJamal, sitting nearby, shook his head as if to say no, no, no. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to die,\u201d he explained. \u201cHe is my friend.\u201d\nIn early October \u2014 roughly six weeks after we were taken \u2014 they moved us into a concrete building where we sometimes heard gunfire between warring militias outside our windows and sometimes a mother singing nearby to her child, her voice low and sweet. The sound of it filled me with longing. The three Somali men who were kidnapped with us were put into a room down the hallway, their shoes lined up outside the door. Abdi, the freelance cameraman, occasionally sat in the threshold, reading the Koran in the light from the hall. A few times I peered out and flashed him the hand sign for \u201cO.K.,\u201d as in \u201cYou O.K.?\u201d Each time he shook his head, looking forlorn.\nOur room was large and unfurnished. Nigel and I lived like a two-person family, doing what we could to fight off depression, to distract ourselves from the gnawing hunger. I poured the tea, and Nigel washed our clothes. Our captors had given us basic supplies \u2014 two tubes of toothpaste, some Q-tips, nail clippers, a packet of acetaminophen tablets as large as horse pills. I received a cloaklike dress and head scarf, both made from red polyester. Nigel was given a couple of collared shirts. Between us, we had two tin plates and a single spoon. With what little food we were given, we made menus, eating our meals on a table-size square of brown linoleum the boys had tossed in our room. Some days we ate the buns followed by the tuna; other days it was tuna followed by the buns.\nTo pass the time we tracked insects as they climbed the iron window grates. Once, looking outside, we saw a fat brown snake, maybe eight feet long, rippling through the sand in the alleyway behind the house. Otherwise, there was little to see.\nNigel fashioned a small backgammon game, crafting playing pieces from our Q-tips \u2014 one of us using the cotton nubs, the other using pieces of the plastic handles, which he clipped with a pair of beard-trimming scissors. On a sheet from a notebook we received, he drew two rows of triangles and then, using a couple of acetaminophen tablets and the scissors, carved a set of dice, itty-bitty white cubes with tiny numbers written on the sides in pen.\nWe played for hours. We played for days. He won. I won. We played rapid-fire and without much conversation or commentary, like two monkeys in some sort of deprivation experiment. If we heard footsteps in the hallway, we quickly slid everything under my mattress. Games, like so many other things that might divert us from religion, were forbidden, haram.\nEarly on, Nigel and I told our captors that we wanted to convert to Islam. It was a survival move and not a spiritual one, made in the hope that it might garner us better treatment. Five times a day now, prodded by the craggy voice of a muezzin calling from a nearby mosque, we went through the motions of prayer. We each received English translations of the Koran. A few of the boys spent time teaching us how to memorize verses in Arabic, so we could gain favor with Allah. In the evenings, the group of them sat on the patio, chanting Koranic verses.\nBack at home, my mother had become the de facto negotiator for both my family and Nigel\u2019s. I was allowed to speak with her a handful of times. Our phone calls were quick, conducted over faulty cellphone connections, and wrenching every time. It felt as if the two of us were swimming between enormous ocean waves, shouting into walls of water. She told me that she loved me, that people at home were praying for us. Our captors were demanding $3 million for the two of us. She told me they were trying to get some money together. Those were the words she used, \u201cget some money together.\u201d What that meant, given their financial circumstances, I couldn\u2019t imagine.\nAnytime I thought of my parents, I was overcome with guilt. My one hope was that our captors would simply get tired of waiting and let us go. Each night, as we were getting ready to sleep, I would turn and say to Nigel, \u201cNow we are one day closer to being free.\u201d\nThen one morning late in October, several of the boys stormed our room, surprising us as we sat eating breakfast on the floor. They dragged away Nigel\u2019s foam mat and unhooked his mosquito netting from the wall. A few minutes later, they returned for Nigel, guns leveled at his chest, motioning him toward the door. There was no explanation, no dialogue. I watched the back of his shirt as it moved away from me. There was no goodbye or anything. He was just gone.\nThey put him in a small, bare room right next to the one we had shared. We\u2019d peeked into it plenty of times before, as we came and went from the bathroom down the hall. We were worried from the start that they would separate us, because in traditional Islam, unmarried men and women were not supposed to consort. I couldn\u2019t guess why they chose that particular day to finally do it. Perhaps it had something to do with the fact that it had been eight weeks since we were taken from the road, and there was no sign of a ransom payment.\nThe boys\u2019 anger seemed to be percolating. There were days when nobody spoke to me at all \u2014 when Jamal said nothing as he delivered food, when Abdullah, the would-be suicide bomber, hovered menacingly in my doorway. The isolation put me in a cistern, dark and deep. The leaders of the group holding us mostly stayed away, though every so often one would arrive at the house and pose a question sent from home, breaking my solitude with a query flung over continents, evoking something both intimate and concrete.\n\u201cWhat award did Dad win recently?\u201d Communities in Bloom, for his gardening.\n\u201cWhere does Oma keep her candy?\u201d In a pumpkin-shaped jar.\nMy answers were to furnish proof to my family that I was alive. To me, the questions also felt like gifts, an invitation to pass an afternoon conjuring my grandmother\u2019s tidy house or the quivering dahlias in my father\u2019s backyard.\nSometimes I was despairing, but other times I felt my mind beginning to carry me. I didn\u2019t know if it was a survival tool or the first flutter of lunacy, but I began to feel as if my thoughts held new power. One morning I ate a tin of tuna and then sat for an hour holding the spoon in front of me, trying to see if I could bend it with my mind. I couldn\u2019t, not even a little, but still, the idea seemed less crazy, more possible, than it once had.\nDuring the hottest hours of the day, the boys dozed in the shade of the veranda outside, while one of them stayed awake for guard duty. Usually in the afternoons, it was Abdullah on patrol. He often opened my door without warning. He didn\u2019t say anything, clutching his gun, keeping his gaze on me for several full minutes without moving. Sometimes, he searched my room, noisily rooting through my belongings, throwing things against the wall. I realized later that he was just testing the waters \u2014 seeing what he could get away with as the others slept outside.\nOne day he showed up and closed the door behind him. He leaned his gun against the wall. I knew right away what was happening. It didn\u2019t matter that I had worried about this. It didn\u2019t matter that I tried desperately to fight him off as he forced himself on me. In less than three minutes it was over, three impossibly long minutes.\nI felt as if I had been evicted from my body, as if I no longer fit in my own skin. My mind ticked through every mistake I ever made. Why had I come to Somalia? What had I done? Every fear I ever had came back to me \u2014 darkness was scary, noises were scary. I felt like a child. I hated facing the uncertainty of every afternoon, not knowing whether Abdullah was coming or not.\nEventually, to ease my own agony, I began to walk circles. I did one lap around the room and then another. Soon, I was walking six or seven hours a day in my bare feet. A dirty pathway took shape on the floor, a miniature one-lane track. In motion, I told myself things, the words resonating right down through my legs: I will get out of here. I will be O.K.\nWhen I wasn\u2019t walking, I spent time standing at one of the two windows in my room, feeling the outside air float through the grilles that covered it. One afternoon, a light rain began to dapple the concrete wall across the alleyway from my window. The sky darkened to a powdery gray. A wind gusted, rushing through trees I couldn\u2019t see, causing the rain to spray sideways on the wall.\n\u201cGod, it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d a voice said, clear as day, articulating my exact thought at the exact moment I had it.\nThe voice wasn\u2019t mine. But it was a voice I knew. \u201cNige?\u201d\nThe voice said, \u201cTrout?\u201d Trout was a nickname I had since high school.\nFor a shocked second, we were both silent. He was maybe 10 feet away from me at the window in his room. Because the alleyway was narrow and the tin roof of our house overlapped slightly with that of the house behind it, the acoustics were perfect. Our voices carried clearly, sheltered by the rooftops. It was a little miracle of physics. We had gone weeks without figuring this out, but now we had.\nStanding at our windows, Nigel and I spoke each day for hours on end, keeping our voices low and our Korans open on our sills in case anyone walked in. We ran through old stories, adding new details every time. We discussed our nighttime dreams, our interactions with the boys. I started one day to tell him about Abdullah, but then stopped myself: It didn\u2019t seem fair to involve him in something he could do nothing about. Instead, we made guesses about what was happening with ransom negotiations. We talked about the future as if it were arriving at any minute. When Christmas came, marking the end of our fourth month as hostages, we quietly sang carols together.\nOn Jan. 14, a Wednesday, I stepped into the hallway, headed toward the shower, and noticed a new stillness in the house. The shoes belonging to our Somali colleagues \u2014 Abdi, Mahad and Marwali \u2014 had disappeared, all three pairs. A while later, I was able to ask Abdullah where they went. He didn\u2019t hesitate. Seeming pleased with himself, he lifted a finger and made an emphatic throat-slitting gesture. My stomach churned. Before we were captured, Abdi had proudly shown me pictures of his children \u2014 two boys and a girl, smiling little kids in school uniforms, who it now seemed, thanks to me, had no father. If our captors had killed their fellow Somalis, Muslim brothers all three, it didn\u2019t bode well for me and Nigel.\nWas there some way out? There had to be. Nigel told me he had been studying the window in the bathroom we shared and thought we could climb through it. I, too, had looked at that window plenty of times, seeing no option there. About eight feet off the bathroom floor, recessed far back in the thick wall up near the ceiling, was a ledge maybe two feet deep, almost like an alcove. But what was at the end of it hardly counted as a window. It was rather a screen made of decorative bricks with a few gaps, serving as ventilation holes for the bathroom. The bricks were cemented together. And then, as if that weren\u2019t enough, laid horizontally in front of the bricks was a series of five metal bars anchored into the window frame.\n\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d I said to Nigel. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible. How would we get out?\u201d\n\u201cYou should crawl up there,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking at the bricks. The mortar is crumbling. We could dig it out.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but the bars. . . .\u201d\n\u201cI think I could pull them loose. They\u2019re not that secure. I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, sounding not entirely confident, \u201cbut I think it could work.\u201d\nIt took some effort to pull myself up to the window in the bathroom. I had to stand with one foot planted on either side of the toilet seat, reaching up past my shoulders to boost myself up, as if levering my way out of a swimming pool.\nWith my face up close to the window, I could see that Nigel was right. The bricks covering the opening were only loosely cemented. The mortar between them crumbled at my touch, coming away in small cascades of white dust. I had brought my nail clippers, and using them, I was able to reach between the metal bars and poke into the cement between the bricks. With some diligent chipping, it seemed possible that we could remove a few rows of bricks.\nThe metal bars were another matter. They were about three feet long and appeared to be sunk deep into the walls on either side of the window, though Nigel had already managed to loosen one of them from its anchor points. He swore to me earlier that he could muscle at least one more out of its hold. Feeling elated, I dropped back to the bathroom floor, covered in grit and cobwebs. I hurried to my room, for the first time in months not thinking about danger or hunger or worry, consumed instead by the idea that we could make a hole to the outside, a body-size hole, and slip through it.\nStanding at our windows, we began to work on a plan. What time of day would we go? What would we bring? Which direction would we run? Who would we seek out, and what would we say? The considerations were enormous.\nAll the while, we traded shifts in the bathroom, hauling ourselves onto the ledge with fingernail clippers in hand, chiseling at the mortar in hurried 5- and 10-minute bursts. The work was gratifying, like digging for gold. Sometimes I got dust; other times, with some careful prying, I managed to extract a nice little slab of fully intact cement.\nBecause my door was in easy sight of the veranda where the boys spent their time, I had to be cautious \u2014 knocking for permission to leave my room, never staying too long in the bathroom. I was also frail. The muscles in my arms had become wasted and wobbly, my elbows often buckling when I tried to pull myself up to the window ledge.\nGiven where his room was located, Nigel was in a better position than I to make undetected trips to the bathroom and to stay there longer. He worked methodically, but there was no hiding the mess we made, the skewed bricks and mounds of loose mortar sitting on the sill. I tried to take solace in the knowledge that the boys walked into our bathroom only once or twice a week \u2014 mainly to take the oversize bucket we used for water and refill it at a tap outside. The risk still felt huge.\nOn the start of the third day, Nigel announced that he had carved out the final brick. He then had to contend with the metal bars, but the first one was already loose, and he said it would take only one more to create enough space to pass through.\nWe decided that we should make our break that same night, slipping out the window around 8 p.m., just after the evening\u2019s final prayer. We were banking on that night being like every other night in the house, governed by the mind-numbing clockwork routine \u2014 prayer followed by dinner, followed by prayer, followed by bedtime for everyone but the two boys on guard duty, who would sit outside, talking idly in the darkness.\nI was startled, then, when Jamal arrived in my room with dinner a full hour ahead of when the meal usually came.\n\u201cAsalaamu Alikum,\u201d he said with a slow smile. Peace be upon you.\nMy thoughts spun. Did they suspect something? What was happening?\nJamal waved for me to pull out my tin plate and lay it on the floor. He then opened a plastic bag and slid something onto it \u2014 a slender piece of deep-fried fish, golden brown and glistening with oil. From his pocket, he pulled out two small limes and set them next to the fish.\nIt was protein, a gift. It seemed that he was worried about my diet. \u201cYou like?\u201d Jamal said, pointing at the fish.\nWe stood for a few seconds, regarding each other. I gave myself an internal kick. Snap out of it. \u201cOh, Jamal,\u201d I said, lifting the plate, \u201cthis is so nice of you.\u201d I smiled at him, feeling a touch of guilt. I hoped the leaders wouldn\u2019t punish him too badly after I was gone.\nFollowing the day\u2019s last prayer, I rapped on my door and pushed it open slightly to see who responded. It was Abdullah who peered down the hallway, which meant that he was on nighttime guard duty. My heart sank. Abdullah liked to roam.\n\u201cMukuusha,\u201d I said in Somali, pointing at my stomach. Bathroom. \u201cI am feeling sick. Very sick.\u201d\nAbdullah snapped his fingers to indicate that I could go.\nSlowly and coolly, I left my room and walked down the hallway in the direction of the bathroom. Earlier in the evening, I smuggled my backpack to the bathroom and left it on the window ledge. Inside it, I had put a head scarf and the heavy black abaya I wore the day we were kidnapped, so that once outside, I could better blend in. Nigel stood waiting for me at his doorway. He had done some advance work in the bathroom, wrenching two bars out of the walls, then putting them back in place, propped up precariously with chunks of loose cement.\nUp in the alcove, Nigel removed the two bars and next began gingerly unstacking the bricks from the window frame. I could hear him panting. One brick came away, then two, then three, then four. When they were all out, he jumped back to the floor and motioned that we were ready. After I put on my abaya, Nigel lifted me toward the window and the 18-inch gap that was now there.\nI looked through that hole for no longer than two seconds, but it was enough to see everything. I could see the alleyway beneath, and the darkness of a village with no lights and everything uncertain beyond. We had worried about breaking our ankles in the drop. We had worried about so many things, and as I stared at the gap in the window, every one of those things felt there, right on the other side, along with our freedom. I turned around and started to back my way through the remaining window bars, sliding both feet through the gap \u2014 with two of the remaining bars above me and one bar beneath \u2014 lowering myself slowly into the air outside. I could feel a breeze on my ankles. It worked until it didn\u2019t: I pushed myself back and felt my rear end jam up against one of the bars still in the window. The gap was too small. If I couldn\u2019t fit, Nigel never would.\n\u201cGo, go, come on,\u201d Nigel whispered from below.\n\u201cI can\u2019t. It\u2019s not working.\u201d I thrust again at the bar to show him my predicament. He looked distraught, his forehead slick with sweat. I said, \u201cCan you take out another bar?\u201d\n\u201cNot now,\u201d he said, almost hissing. \u201cIt makes too much noise.\u201d\nNigel waved a hand, telling me to climb down. \u201cGet back to your room,\u201d he said. \u201cQuickly. I\u2019ll try to fix this up.\u201d\nI walked to my room as casually as I could and closed the door noisily, to let Abdullah know I had returned. I lay on my mattress in the dark, trying to muster one calm thought. I knew it was only a matter of time before our plan was discovered \u2014 before one of our captors spotted the jury-rigged pile of bricks and bent bars that comprised the bathroom window or just read the whole stupid plotline in my eyes.\nAfter dawn broke and the boy named Hassam came to open our window shutters before prayer, Nigel and I stood at our sills, deciding that we had to leave immediately. Quickly, we redrew the outline of our plan. We knew from the calls of the muezzin that there was a mosque somewhere close by. It seemed like the one good option, a place to find a crowd. We waited for the midday prayer, for the heat to arrive and the boys to start nodding off. I knocked for the bathroom, and Nigel met me there, holding my backpack. Early that morning, he pulled out a third window bar. I waited while he quickly unstacked the bricks again. This time, I didn\u2019t hesitate. I got one leg out the window and then the second. I slid a few inches on my stomach to lessen the distance to the ground, holding on to one of the remaining window bars for support, and then I let myself drop.\nWe hit the ground one right after the other, me and then Nigel, two soft thumps in the sand. My heart lifted and crashed with the impact.\nThings were bad. I knew it the instant I touched the soil. Nothing appeared the way I had imagined it. To the left was a sideways-leaning fence made of patchwork pieces of colored tin and old, flattened oil cans. To the right was a row of shanties, built from more tin and pieces of loose burlap. There wasn\u2019t a bit of vegetation in sight, beyond a few brambly thorn bushes, low and leafless in the sand. More alarming was the emaciated child, a boy of maybe 7, standing only a few feet away from me, naked but for a pair of shorts, swaybacked and wide-eyed and looking like he might scream.\nThe boy took off at a sprint \u2014 heading, I was sure, toward the first adult he could find.\nIt was as if a starting gun had been shot, as if a seismic disturbance had unsettled the air, rippling over the rooftops to the patio where our captors lay in repose. Everything became instinctual then. Nigel and I didn\u2019t even look at each other. We just started, madly, to run.\nEvery strategy we plotted at our windowsills flew out of our heads. Every bit of reason lifted away as we dashed down the alleyway.\nAt the end of the alley was a rutted sand road, and on the road there were shacks and some market stalls and the land beyond was a flat brown. Nigel was yelling at nobody and everyone, screaming \u2018\u2018I caawi, I caawi,\u201d the Somali words for \u201chelp me.\u201d\nI saw it all in a high-speed panic, which is to say I barely saw it, or caught it only in flashes \u2014 a half-collapsed wall, a few nervous goats, a donkey lashed to a cart by two thin poles. We ran through it and past it, this landscape we had spent hours imagining, this place to which we were colossally mismatched, me behind Nigel, Nigel shouting, the heat warping the air around us, all of it with the unreality of a bad dream. People on the street spotted us and fled. Later, I would look back on it and realize that if you are running in a place like Somalia, everyone understands that you are running from danger. Which means that they, too, should run.\nThe mosque was tall and wide, painted green and white with a crescent moon on top and a short set of wooden steps leading to a wooden platform and an entrance. The platform was heaped with shoes, signaling that the place was full of people. Moving up the stairs behind Nigel, I felt the first trickle of relief, a feeling so unfamiliar that I almost couldn\u2019t identify it.\nJust then, a lone person came skidding around the street corner. It was Hassam, one of the younger guards. His expression was one of disbelief and selfish terror. I saw Abdullah run up, just behind him.\nI bolted forward into the mosque, forgetting to remove my shoes. What I saw first was a field of men \u2014 kneeling, sitting, milling about in small groups. There were prayer mats spread in lines across the floor. Heads turned. A few people stood up. The interior of the mosque was vast, a single room with a vaulted ceiling. I heard myself calling out Somali words and English words and also some Arabic, my brain blurry with distress. I shouted, \u201cHelp!\u201d and \u201cMay the blessings of Allah be upon you!\u201d and \u201cI am Muslim!\u201d Nigel, too, was yelling.\nA crowd magnetized around us, men with puzzled faces, some showing alarm. And then Abdullah was upon me, having blasted through the door with Jamal right behind, both of them holding guns.\nAbdullah lunged and I dodged, feeling his grasp slip off my shoulder. I ran to a far corner of the room, where another group of men sat on the floor. I said every Arabic word I could think of as they lifted their bearded faces toward me, dumbstruck. Off to the side, Jamal had corralled Nigel against a wall and was hitting him repeatedly in the head, pounding on him with a closed fist, beating him with every ounce of strength he had. Nigel, I could see, was trying to hit him back, all the while shouting, \u201cJamal! Jamal!\u201d as if to remind him that, in a weird way, they were once friends.\nMy fear organized itself into speed. I ducked through a doorway leading out into the air. With Abdullah two paces behind me, I leapt over the three stairs that descended from the side door of the mosque, landing in heavy sand, shedding my flip-flops as I ran. A gunshot ripped overhead, hollowing out the air. I looked back to see Abdullah, who had stopped running long enough to fire at me. My mind circled back toward the mosque. Nigel was inside. Inside was safer than outside. Keeping my shoulders low, I did a high-speed 20-yard end run around Abdullah, throwing myself back up the stairs and into the mosque.\nThe scene inside was oddly calm. Nigel had managed to shed Jamal and was sitting, not quite placidly but pretend placidly, at the front of the mosque, in the semicircular area that served as the imam\u2019s pulpit, surrounded by a loose cluster of maybe 15 bearded men, most of them standing. I dropped to my knees next to Nigel, who was speaking English with some of the men, sounding like he was answering to some skepticism that he was Muslim.\nThrough a large, low window to one side of the pulpit, I could see a woman, sheathed entirely in black, peeking in at us, until one of the men strode to the window and slammed its metal shutters closed.\nAbdullah had re-entered the mosque. He was creeping his way into the group of bystanders, his gun canted loosely in my direction, sweat dripping through his hair and shining his cheeks. Nigel, meanwhile, was loudly reciting verses of the Koran like a schoolboy.\nOne of the men explained to us that someone was phoning the local imam, who was in the next village but would come to hear our story and give his judgment. \u201cInshallah, everything will be fine,\u201d he said, indicating that we should remain seated on the floor. \u201cInshallah, maybe 15 minutes.\u201d\nI felt relieved by this. An imam, I figured, would want to help us. I could hear Abdullah and Jamal arguing \u2014 politely \u2014 with some of the men.\nAbruptly, a woman parted the quarreling crowd, elbowing her way past the men with the guns. I recognized her as the woman who had been looking through the window. She wore a black abaya and full hijab, including a niqab draped over her nose and mouth, covering everything but her eyes. Every man in the place was staring at her. The woman noticed no one. She came right over to me, kneeling down at my side without a word. Automatically, I reached for her hand. Her fingers wrapped around mine. I felt, for a second, safer than I\u2019d felt in ages.\nHer eyes were brown and somehow so familiar that it was as if I knew them from somewhere. The tops of her hands were painted with delicate, tendril patterns of rust-colored henna, the sort of ornament that one woman draws painstakingly on another. She was speaking in Somali to the men around us. I watched her, my nerves firing. I couldn\u2019t understand what she was saying. I knew she was helping me somehow. I heard distress in her voice. When she looked at me, her eyes swam with emotion.\nWithout thinking, I reached out and brushed my fingers over her face, feeling the warmth of her cheek beneath the fabric.\nI said, \u201cDo you speak English?\u201d\n\u201cA little,\u201d she said, moving closer. \u201cYou are a Muslim?\u201d\n\u201cYes, from Canada.\u201d\n\u201cYou are my sister,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom Canada.\u201d\nShe reached out both arms, and I let myself fall. I sank my face into the pillows of her body. Her arms fit snugly around me. I felt the edges of my vigilance soften, the domino fall of my defenses. I began to cry. As men jabbered around us, the woman tightened her hold on me. She was the first woman I interacted with in five months. Lifting my head to find her eyes again, I told her I had been a prisoner, that I wanted to go home. My voice rose and fell unevenly. Uttering the word \u201chome\u201d caused me to sob. I pointed toward Abdullah, who was scowling at us, probably 10 feet away. \u201cHe is abusing me,\u201d I said, suddenly desperate. To be sure she understood, I used my fingers to mimic the mechanics of sex.\nI watched the woman\u2019s eyes get wide. \u201cOh, haram,\u201d she said. \u201cHaram, haram.\u201d She looked up to the crowd, her expression ferocious, and shouted a few agitated Somali words.\nBut before anyone could respond, the dynamic in the room changed suddenly. Two of the leaders of the kidnappers had marched into the mosque, looking disheveled and furious, with the captain next to them, waving a pistol.\nOne of them \u2014 a man called Ahmed \u2014 located me and pointed a finger. \u201cYou!\u201d he shouted. \u201cYou have made a big problem!\u201d The air in the mosque had grown stuffy and uncertain, filled with noise. Then came a loud, concussive crack, a gun going off somewhere inside the room.\nThe sound of it broke the spell, the holding pattern. I saw Abdullah pushing through the crowd in my direction, his head lowered like a bull\u2019s. I screamed as he dove at me. He caught my feet with his hands and began dragging me in the direction of the side door. I clawed at the ground as he pulled. I don\u2019t remember any of the onlookers trying to stop him.\nIt was only the woman who tried.\nShe clamped on to my arms and pulled me back, using her weight for leverage, letting loose a torrent of Somali. For a few minutes, my body was strung between them, with Abdullah yanking my legs while the Somali woman proved herself a stubborn anchor. We were being towed along \u2014 the two of us, linked like train cars \u2014 inch by inch across the floor of the mosque. My shoulder sockets ached to the point where I thought they would pop.\nFinally, she could hang on no longer. I managed to lift my head and look back to see her sprawled on the floor and weeping openly. Her head scarf and niqab had been torn off in the struggle, leaving her exposed. I could see that she was my mother\u2019s age, in her early 50s, with a gentle plump face and high forehead. Her hair had been braided in tiny cornrows over her head. She still had one arm outstretched in my direction. Three men with guns now surrounded her.\nSomeone lifted my shoulders, maneuvering me roughly over the stairs outside the mosque and into a courtyard. My abaya had ridden up over my waist. My jeans, which were already baggy because I had lost so much weight, were slipping toward my ankles as Abdullah jerked me forward, holding my legs on either side of his chest as if pulling a cart. As we moved over the courtyard, my body skimming the dirt, I felt my frayed underwear sliding off as well. I was naked, basically, stomach to knees.\nI felt something wet hit my stomach and realized I had been spat on. We were moving through a crowd, past a metal gatepost marking the edge of the courtyard and the entry to the road. I reached out and caught the post, latching on to it with both hands.\nAbdullah turned to see what had stopped his progress. Beyond him and through the gate, I could see a blue truck waiting with its engine running. Another gunshot echoed from inside the mosque. Nigel, I thought. They\u2019ve killed Nigel. The thought was like a suck hole, a thing that could kill me. I spotted a woman\u2019s narrow face looking down at me from the crowd, her expression unreadable. I screamed at her in English: \u201cWhy won\u2019t you help me?\u201d\nShe looked stricken. \u201cI don\u2019t speak English,\u201d she said in perfect English.\nSuddenly, the knuckles on one of my hands exploded in pain. Someone had kicked it to loosen my grip on the pole. I howled and let go. Then I was being pushed to my feet and toward the truck. I saw two other men hauling Nigel through the door of the mosque and in our direction. The sight of him brought a wash of solace and a hammer blow of anxiety. It had been all of 45 minutes since we slipped through the window. We made it out but not truly out. We crossed the river only halfway. Things would get worse from here. Everything that followed would be aftermath, punishment.\nNigel and I would remain hostages for another 10 months. We were freed, finally, on Nov. 25, 2009, 460 days after we were taken, and only after our families managed to raise just over $1 million for a ransom and the services of a private security company. They held fund-raisers, accepted other donations and borrowed where they could. (Later, we learned, to our relief, that the three Somali men who were kidnapped with us had not been killed, but rather released unharmed.)\nFor a while, I kept track of my freedom, counting the days and the weeks and eventually the months that separated me from my captivity, sliding them like beads on an abacus, hoping that at some point one thing would feel stronger, more significant, than the other. But it doesn\u2019t work that way, exactly. What I\u2019ve learned is that freedom can\u2019t fully overtake its absence. Once lost, a part stays lost forever.\nI live with what happened. Memories leap the border between then and now. One sensation abruptly rivets itself to another \u2014 hot sand, the smell of an overripe banana, the rattling of a diesel truck \u2014 and tosses me, with a pounding heart, into the past. But that day, in particular, stays with me. The sweaty paranoia of slipping through the window, the frenzied dash into the mosque, the confusion that followed. All of it sits locked in my mind, surreal and forever vivid. I don\u2019t know what happened to the woman in the mosque, the stranger whose name I never knew, who fought until I was dragged out of her arms. But I recall the elemental comfort of her embrace and all the terror and sadness she seemed to be beating back with it.\nDuring the rest of my captivity, the memory of the escape became a sustaining one. It held an electrical charge, a force. We had been hopeful for how long? Ten minutes? Twelve? Whatever it was, in the context of the dark months to come, the feeling turned out to be vital. I craved it, just one hit of lung-clearing, odds-stacked-against-us, nearly impossible possibility. And when I most needed it, I found I could summon it \u2014 that mad, dim hope. It was like bending a spoon with my mind.",

    "text": "U.S. Textile Plants Return, With Floors Largely Empty of People\n2013-09-19T23:11:10.000Z\nGAFFNEY, S.C. \u2014 The old textile mills here are mostly gone now. Gaffney Manufacturing, National Textiles, Cherokee \u2014 clangorous, dusty, productive engines of the Carolinas fabric trade \u2014 fell one by one to the forces of globalization.\nJust as the Carolinas benefited when manufacturing migrated first from the Cottonopolises of England to the mill towns of New England and then to here, where labor was even cheaper, they suffered in the 1990s when the textile industry mostly left the United States.\nIt headed to China, India, Mexico \u2014 wherever people would spool, spin and sew for a few dollars or less a day. Which is why what is happening at the old Wellstone spinning plant is so remarkable.\nDrive out to the interstate, with the big peach-shaped water tower just down the highway, and you\u2019ll find the mill up and running again. Parkdale Mills, the country\u2019s largest buyer of raw cotton, reopened it in 2010.\nBayard Winthrop, the founder of the sweatshirt and clothing company American Giant, was at the mill one morning earlier this year to meet with his Parkdale sales representative. Just last year, Mr. Winthrop was buying fabric from a factory in India. Now, he says, it is cheaper to shop in the United States. Mr. Winthrop uses Parkdale yarn from one of its 25 American factories, and has that yarn spun into fabric about four miles from Parkdale\u2019s Gaffney plant, at Carolina Cotton Works.\nMr. Winthrop says American manufacturing has several advantages over outsourcing. Transportation costs are a fraction of what they are overseas. Turnaround time is quicker. Most striking, labor costs \u2014 the reason all these companies fled in the first place \u2014 aren\u2019t that much higher than overseas because the factories that survived the outsourcing wave have largely turned to automation and are employing far fewer workers.\nAnd while Mr. Winthrop did not run into such problems, monitoring worker safety in places like Bangladesh, where hundreds of textile workers have died in recent years in fires and other disasters, has become a huge challenge. \u201cWhen I framed the business, I wasn\u2019t saying, \u2018From the cotton in the ground to the finished product, this is going to be all American-made,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t some patriotic quest.\u201d\nInstead, he said, the road to Gaffney was all about protecting his bottom line.\nThat simple, if counterintuitive, example is changing both Gaffney and the American textile and apparel industries.\nIn 2012, textile and apparel exports were $22.7 billion, up 37 percent from just three years earlier. While the size of operations remain behind those of overseas powers like China, the fact that these industries are thriving again after almost being left for dead is indicative of a broader reassessment by American companies about manufacturing in the United States.\nIn 2012, the M.I.T. Forum for Supply Chain Innovation and the publication Supply Chain Digest conducted a joint survey of 340 of their members. The survey found that one-third of American companies with manufacturing overseas said they were considering moving some production to the United States, and about 15 percent of the respondents said they had already decided to do so.\n\u201cThis is a completely different manufacturing paradigm than what we saw 10 years ago,\u201d said David Simchi-Levi, a professor at M.I.T. who conducted the survey.\nBeyond the cost and time benefits, companies often get a boost with consumers by promoting American-made products, according to a survey conducted in January by The New York Times.\nThe survey found that 68 percent of respondents preferred products made in the United States, even if they cost more, and 63 percent believed they were of higher quality. Retailers from Walmart to Abercrombie & Fitch are starting to respond to those sentiments, creating sections for American-made items and sourcing goods domestically.\nBut as manufacturers find that American-made products are not only appealing but affordable, they are also finding the business landscape has changed. Two decades of overseas production has decimated factories here. Between 2000 and 2011, on average, 17 manufacturers closed up shop every day across the country, according to research from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.\nNow, companies that want to make things here often have trouble finding qualified workers for specialized jobs and American-made components for their products. And politicians\u2019 promises that American manufacturing means an abundance of new jobs is complicated \u2014 yes, it means jobs, but on nowhere near the scale there was before, because machines have replaced humans at almost every point in the production process.\nTake Parkdale: The mill here produces 2.5 million pounds of yarn a week with about 140 workers. In 1980, that production level would have required more than 2,000 people.\nCurse of Long Distance\nWhen Bayard Winthrop founded American Giant, he knew precisely what he wanted to make: thick sweatshirts like the one from the Navy that his father used to wear.\nThey required a dry \u201chand feel,\u201d so the fabric would not seem greasy to the touch, and a soft, heavily plucked underside. Mr. Winthrop had already produced sportswear overseas, so he looked there for the advanced techniques and affordable pricing he needed.\nHe wanted to sell his hooded sweatshirt for around $80, between the $10 Walmart version, made in China, and the $125 Polo Ralph Lauren version, made in Peru. He was insistent on cutting and sewing the sweatshirts in the United States \u2014 a company called American Giant couldn\u2019t do that part overseas, he felt \u2014 but wasn\u2019t picky about where the fabric came from.\nWith the help of a consultant, he settled on a mill in Haryana, India, that could make the desired fabric. After several months of back-and-forth, Mr. Winthrop was ready to ship his first sweatshirts in February 2012.\nBut he was frustrated with the quality, and the lengthy process. By October of last year, Mr. Winthrop had moved production to South Carolina. Now it takes just a month or so, start to finish, to get a sweatshirt to a customer.\n\u201cWe just avoid so many big and small stumbles that invariably happen when you try to do things from far away,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would never be where we are today if we were overseas. Nowhere close.\u201d\nThe problems in India were cultural, bureaucratic and practical.\nTime was foremost among them. The Indian mill needed too much time \u2014 three to five months \u2014 to perfect its designs, send samples, schedule production, ship the fabric to the United States and get it through customs. Mr. Winthrop was hesitant to predict demand that far in advance.\nThere were also communication issues. Mr. Winthrop would send the Indian factory so-called tech packs that detailed exactly what kind of fabric he wanted and what variations he would allow. But even with photos and drawings, the roll-to-roll variance was big. And he couldn\u2019t afford to fly to India regularly, or hire someone to monitor production there.\nHe also found that suppliers deferred to his wishes, rather than being frank about some of his choices, which weren\u2019t, he conceded, always good ones.\n\u201cI\u2019m a supporter of outsourcing when it makes sense,\u201d he said. But it had stopped making sense.\nNow that production has shifted to the United States, Mr. Winthrop says those problems have disappeared. Mr. Winthrop and his team visit Carolina Cotton Works and Parkdale whenever they want, check on quality and toss ideas around with the managers. And, he says, the cost is less than in India.\nWhere Mr. Winthrop relies on labor \u2014 the cutting and sewing of the sweatshirts, which he does in five factories in California and North Carolina \u2014 is where the costs jump up. That costs his company around $17 for a given sweatshirt; overseas, he says, it would cost $5.50.\nBut truth be told, labor is not a big ingredient in the manufacturing uptick in the United States, textiles or otherwise. Indeed, the absence of high-paid American workers in the new factories has made the revival possible.\n\u201cMost of our costs are power-related,\u201d said Dan Nation, a senior Parkdale executive.\nMarch of the Machines\nStep inside Parkdale Mills, and prepare to be overwhelmed by machines.\nThe ceilings are high and the machines stretch city block after city block \u2014 this one tossing around bits of cotton to clean them, that one taking four-millimeter layers from different bales to blend them.\nOnly infrequently does a person interrupt the automation, mainly because certain tasks are still cheaper if performed by hand \u2014 like moving half-finished yarn between machines on forklifts. Beyond that, there is little that resembles the mills of just a few decades ago.\nTell people about a textile plant and \u201ctheir image is \u2018Norma Rae,\u2019 and everyone\u2019s sick and dirty and coughing and it\u2019s terrible,\u201d said Mike Hubbard, vice president of the National Council of Textile Organizations.\nNot here. The air-cleaning room, where air is washed 6.5 times an hour to get contaminants out, could be a modern-art installation, with liquid raining into pools of water. Along the ceiling, moving racks like those at a dry cleaner snake throughout the factory, carrying the finished yarn to a machine for packaging and shipping. That machine has enough lights and outlets on it that it resembles a music studio soundboard.\nFor Parkdale, the new technology has been its salvation.\nFounded in 1916, Parkdale is the largest buyer of raw cotton in the United States. In the 1960s, when its current chairman, Duke Kimbrell, took over, it was a single plant with a couple of hundred workers.\nSeeing that other plants in the area were streamlining their businesses and ceasing to make their own yarn, Parkdale supplied yarn to nearby manufacturers like Hanesbrands. Business flourished, and Parkdale acquired competitors and soared until the 1990s.\nThat\u2019s when its clients started fleeing the United States.\nThe North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994 was the first blow, erasing import duties on much of the apparel produced in Mexico. The Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, when currencies collapsed, added a 30 to 40 percent discount to already cheaper overseas products, textile executives said. China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 and quickly became an apparel powerhouse, and as of 2005, the W.T.O. eliminated textile quotas.\nIn 1991, American-made apparel accounted for 56.2 percent of all the clothing bought domestically, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association. By 2012, it accounted for 2.5 percent. Over all, the American manufacturing sector lost 32 percent of its jobs, 5.8 million of them, between 1990 and 2012, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The textile and apparel subsectors were hit even harder, losing 76.5 percent of their jobs, or 1.2 million.\n\u201cWith all the challenges that we\u2019ve had with cheap imports, we knew in order to survive we\u2019d have to take technology as far as we could,\u201d said Anderson Warlick, Parkdale\u2019s chief executive.\nThe company began meeting with machine manufacturers, doing trial runs of equipment and offering feedback and debugging, so it got dibs on the newest technology. It looked for business opportunities in the countries where its customers were heading, those in Central America in particular, and now 75 percent of its business is in exports.\nOver all, the company employs 4,000 people, its biggest work force ever, but it is technology that has made it competitive.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to be effective here because we invested in our manufacturing to the point that labor is not as big of an issue as far as total cost as it once was,\u201d Mr. Warlick said. \u201cIt\u2019s allowed us to be able to compete more effectively with foreign countries that pay, you know, a fraction of what we pay in wages. We compete with them on technology and productivity.\u201d\nBack From the Dead\nAll that automation has made working in the mill \u2014 which once meant mostly dead-end jobs for people with no other options \u2014 desirable for many people.\nHoward Taggert, 86, got his first mill job in 1948 after high school. \u201cBy being a color, yeah, you\u2019ve got the worst jobs there was in textile,\u201d said Mr. Taggert, who is African-American. \u201cIt was rough, but it was a living. We made a living.\u201d\nHe started by opening cotton bales, which involved striking an ax onto a metal tie around the bales \u2014 a dangerous job, given that a spark from metal striking metal could ignite a room full of cotton. The dust was so thick that he couldn\u2019t see to the next aisle, he said. He was paid 87 cents an hour.\n\u201cI had to. I didn\u2019t have no other choice,\u201d he said of working in the mills.\nThe work was so bad that Mr. Taggert refused to let his children go into mill work. He might be surprised to hear about Donna McKoy, who went back to work in a mill even after earning an associate degree in criminal justice.\nMs. McKoy, 47, lost her job at Continental Fabrics in North Carolina in the early 2000s, \u201cwhen everything was downsizing and going over to China.\u201d In 2001 alone, textile plants in the Carolinas eliminated 15,000 jobs. The sense of desperation was palpable, Ms. McKoy said.\n\u201cNow what?\u201d she remembers asking herself before she decided to go to college.\nAfter a headhunter contacted her in 2007, she became a supervisor at Parkdale, overseeing a night shift of 11 workers. The work \u2014 and the workplace \u2014 are barely recognizable compared with her job a decade ago. A couple of things struck her right away. First, the mill was clean. \u201cMost open-end spinning plants that have the older model spinning frames in them are really dirty and dusty and not fun to be around,\u201d she said. Thanks to the new technology, \u201cmy plant is always clean.\u201d\nSecond, Ms. McKoy got training. For her first eight months, Parkdale paid for hotels, food, dry-cleaning and gas for trips home as she rotated around different factories and learned all of the jobs. And there were fewer people. Ms. McKoy now works at a plant in Walnut Cove, N.C., which she described as a smaller version of the Gaffney plant. On a typical 12-hour shift, Ms. McKoy said, two of the 11 people on her team fix the spinning machines about 4,000 times, with robots\u2019 help.\nShe earns $47,000 a year and says the perks are good, like health care, an in-house nurse and monthly management classes for supervisors. She recently bought a three-bedroom house and owns a car.\n\u201cI have a comfortable life,\u201d she said. \u201cWith this recession that we just had, I didn\u2019t feel it.\u201d\nStill, some Parkdale employees worry about the future. They\u2019ve seen too much hardship in the textile industry to be overly hopeful about a real turnaround.\nScott Symmonds, 40, of Galax, Va., works as a technician for two plants in the area. He never planned on manufacturing work, but after time in the National Guard in Iraq, his home went into foreclosure and he had trouble getting work because of his low credit score and lack of a college degree. As a teenager in rural Iowa, he knew people who worked in manufacturing and watched two plants go out of business.\n\u201cI saw how they would come home dirty, smelly and often injured,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want that.\u201d\nBut he needed a job, and Parkdale was hiring. Mr. Symmonds started as a spinner, then got a job on the packing line, and then snagged a technician\u2019s job after a technical-aptitude test. He earns $15 an hour, which he says is better than what competitors pay. He fears, though, that his higher pay could become a liability.\n\u201cWe are making far more money than our counterparts in China or other nations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to take a big enough cut in pay to be on an even level with those places.\u201d",

Adding historic weight and stylistic texture to the eclectic season are Michel Fokine\u2019s whimsical \u201cLes Sylphides\u201d from 1909 and Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n\u2019s 1949 classic, \u201cThe Moor\u2019s Pavane,\u201d a dramatic retelling of \u201cOthello.\u201d Friday and Tuesday through Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., David H. Koch Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 496-0600, davidhkochtheater.com; $20 to $150. (Brian Schaefer)\nPieter Ampe and Guilherme Garrido (Saturday and Sunday) Brothers, lovers, friends or enemies? So many possibilities when two guys go at it onstage. Pieter Ampe, from Belgium, and Guilherme Garrido, from Portugal, play with the many faces of male relationships, sliding from bonding to beating and back again. Their work \u201cStill Standing You,\u201d part of the Performa 13 festival, is a tender, violent, funny, poignant unpacking of the phenomenon of bromance. Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 5 p.m., Martha Graham Dance Studios, 55 Bethune Street, at Washington Street, West Village, (212) 366-5700, performa-arts.org; $20. (Schaefer)\n\u2018B. Madonna\u2019 (Friday through Sunday) Like her previous evening-length effort, \u201cAfter Eros,\u201d Maureen Fleming\u2019s \u201cB. Madonna\u201d uses text by David Henry Hwang and music by Philip Glass. This new work also features Ms. Fleming twirling nude. Ms. Fleming\u2019s familiar formula will this time be applied to the retelling of the Persephone myth. Friday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 2:30 p.m., La MaMa Ellen Stewart Theater, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org; $10 to $25. (Schaefer)\nBallet Preljocaj (Thursday through Nov. 9) Angelin Preljocaj\u2019s recent work for the New York City Ballet wasn\u2019t exactly a hit with critics, but New York audiences now have a second chance to see his singular, unconventional vision with his own company. Mr. Preljocaj comes to the Brooklyn Academy of Music\u2019s Next Wave festival with \u201cAnd Then, One Thousand Years of Peace,\u201d which examines the nature of truth in an apocalyptic world and the search for redemption. At 7:30 p.m., Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $16 to $50. (Schaefer)\n\u2605 Big Dance Theater (Friday through Nov. 9) Forget hay rides and trick-or-treating. The best way to observe Halloween is with an outing to \u201cIch, K\u00fcrbisgeist,\u201d Big Dance Theater\u2019s autumnally decked-out play about a reclusive peasant clan and its supernatural pumpkin harvest. Paul Lazar directs, Annie-B Parson choreographs and Sibyl Kempson provides the delightfully unintelligible text, written in an invented language. The work had its premiere at the Chocolate Factory last year, and now New York Live Arts has resurrected it as part of the Replay Series. Can this please happen every year? At 7:30 p.m., with 10 p.m. shows on Fridays and Saturdays, New York Live Arts, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, newyorklivearts.org; $15 to $30. (Siobhan Burke)\nMatthew Bourne\u2019s \u2018Sleeping Beauty\u2019  (Friday through Sunday) Though best known for his all-male version of \u201cSwan Lake,\u201d Matthew Bourne has been reinventing the classics for years. Now \u201cSleeping Beauty,\u201d set to the beloved Tchaikovsky score, has been given a new Bourne identity: cheeky humor, cartoonish sets and the occasionally goofy movement. But the man knows how to put on an entertaining show. Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; $30 to $130. (Schaefer)\nCompagnie Marie Chouinard (Wednesday through Nov. 10) Erik Satie\u2019s Gymnop\u00e9dies, a gentle, minimalist musical revolution at the end of the 19th century, is an energetic opposite to the choreographer Marie Chouinard\u2019s often brash and abrasive style. Which makes her interpretation of his work \u2014 with 11 dancers taking turns at a piano \u2014 all the more intriguing. \u201cGymnop\u00e9dies,\u201d which also contains nudity, shares a bill with \u201cHenri Michaux: Mouvements,\u201d inspired by the India ink drawings and poetry of the Belgian artist Henri Michaux. Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday through Nov. 9 at 8 p.m., Nov. 10 at 2 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $10 to $49. (Schaefer)\nDance Heginbotham (Friday and Saturday) Since starting this company just a couple of years ago, John Heginbotham has gained an enthusiastic following, thanks in part to his madcap humor and clever musicality. No stranger to the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where he performed as a longtime member of the Mark Morris Dance Group, he makes his choreographic debut there with \u201cDark Theater,\u201d a work for six dancers based on Francis Picabia\u2019s Dadaist ballet, \u201cRel\u00e2che.\u201d If all goes according to plan, nonsense and non sequiturs will reign. At 7:30 p.m., Fishman Space, Fisher Building, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 321 Ashland Place, near Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20. (Burke)\nMaria Hassabi (Wednesday through Nov. 9) The premiere of a work carries heightened expectations, for both artist and audience. In the aptly titled \u201cPremiere,\u201d presented as part of the Performa 13 festival, Maria Hassabi examines this baggage, an inevitable component of any performing art. Five simultaneous solos zoom in on the minute details of movement, evoking the kind of scrutiny that accompanies the debut of new work. At 8 p.m., the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, thekitchen.org; $15, $12 for students and 65+. (Schaefer)\n\u2605 Kate Weare Company (Wednesday through Nov. 9) As the first artist-in-residence at the BAM Fisher, Kate Weare sets a provocative standard with \u201cDark Lark,\u201d which explores the interplay of sexual fantasy and creative expression. Ms. Weare, known for her visceral take on relationships and intimacy, draws out the idiosyncrasies in each of her dancers to tap into the personal tug of war between boldness and vulnerability and offers a glimpse into uninhibited inner worlds. Chris Lancaster provides an original cello score to set the mood. At 7:30 p.m., Fishman Space, Fisher Building, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 321 Ashland Place, near Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20. (Schaefer)\nKeigwin & Company (Friday through Sunday) For Larry Keigwin, having fun (or making sure his audience does) is a top priority. His dances can border on too cute, but more often than not, he succeeds in his efforts to please. His company rings in its 10th anniversary with two New York premieres (\u201cCanvas,\u201d with music by Adam Crystal, and \u201cGirls,\u201d a female trio to Frank Sinatra), alongside two previous hits, \u201cNatural Selection\u201d and \u201cMattress Suite.\u201d Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $10 to $59. (Burke)\n\u2605 Akram Khan (Wednesday and Thursday) Akram Khan, a choreographer born and based in London, creates powerful, fluid work fusing classical Indian Kathak dance with contemporary dance. \u201cDesh,\u201d Bengali for \u201chomeland,\u201d is a 2011 solo that explores Mr. Khan\u2019s Bangladeshi heritage and his search for identity, making use of clever theatrical devices and impressive animation (beware of elephants). Usually his company performs his work, so a chance to watch the conversation of cultures and dance styles on Mr. Khan\u2019s own body is a treat. At 7:30 p.m., Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, whitelightfestival.org; $25 to $90. (Schaefer)\n\u2605 \u2018Mus\u00e9e de la danse\u2019  (Friday through Sunday) Dance and museums have had a romance for years. One such affair is now at the Museum of Modern Art, where \u201cMus\u00e9e de la Danse: Three Collective Gestures\u201d concludes a three-week run. Conceived by the French choreographer Boris Charmatz, the series ends this weekend with \u201cFlip Book.\u201d Inspired by David Vaughan\u2019s 1997 book, \u201cFifty Years,\u201d which traced a half-century of Merce Cunningham choreography, the performances will be preceded by public warm-ups, rehearsals and discussions with Valda Setterfield, a former Cunningham dancer, beginning at noon. Full performances will take place on Friday and Sunday at 3 and 4 p.m., and on Saturday the 3 p.m. performance will be followed, at 4 p.m., by a panel discussion with Mr. Charmatz, Ms. Setterfield and others. (212) 708-9400, moma.org; museum admission: $25, $18 for 65+, $14 for students, free for members. (Schaefer)\nNew York Theater Ballet (Friday and Saturday) For 35 years, the New York Theater Ballet has been committed to bringing small-scale classics and intimate contemporary work to diverse geographic communities, with special emphasis on attracting young children. In this iteration of \u201cDance on a Shoestring,\u201d the company\u2019s studio series focusing on works from emerging artists, audiences get a \u201cNutcracker\u201d sneak-peak and an excerpt from \u201cThree Shades of Blue,\u201d inspired by early-20th-century American popular dances, among other offerings. Saturday\u2019s performance is followed by a Halloween party with a meet-and-greet with the dancers. Friday at 7 p.m., Saturday at 3:30 p.m., the Dance Gallery, 30 East 31st Street, fifth floor, Manhattan, (212) 679-0401, nytb.org; $15 on Friday; limited availability on Saturday. (Schaefer)\nQueer New York International Arts Festival  (Friday through Sunday) The second edition of this festival picks up where the first left off, proposing an expanded definition of \u201cqueer performance.\u201d The interdisciplinary offerings move beyond issues of gender and sexuality (what the news release calls \u201cexpected queer issues\u201d) to deal with a range of social and aesthetic concerns. Most performances are at Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (866) 811-4111; $10 suggested donation for most events. A full schedule is at abronsartscenter.org or queerny.org. (Burke)\nLegacy Russell and Clifford Owens (Friday) A night out at a bar or club is always something of a dance between two strangers and their respective body language. In a one-night stand of their new work, \u201cThe Kiss,\u201d the performance artists Legacy Russell and Clifford Owens explore this familiar terrain and create verisimilitude by inviting audience members to share the space, mingle, raise a glass and post it all on social media. Within this environment, Ms. Russell and Mr. Owens flirt with the meaning and significance of the titular deed. At 8 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark\u2019s Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, danspaceproject.org; $10 suggested donation, reservations recommended. (Schaefer)\nTina Satter (Friday through Sunday and Thursday through Nov. 9) The scene: a small town dance studio. The story: four characters getting ready for a tap dance competition. In \u201cHouse of Dance,\u201d the experimental theater artist Tina Satter uses this setup to dissect how personal demons and insecurities play out within a group. Piano accompaniment, song breaks and increasingly frantic dancing help further the plot and delve into the work\u2019s psychology. At 8 p.m., Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101, abronsartscenter.org; $18. (Schaefer)\n\u2605 Tatyana Tenenbaum (Friday and Saturday) Before she began choreographing, Ms. Tenenbaum trained as a composer. The complexities of sound \u2014 of the human voice especially \u2014 continue to intrigue her. In \u201cPrivate Country,\u201d she mines the history of American musical theater, combining physical and vocal expression into what she calls \u201can embodiment of longing that smells like the great green grass of our pastoral dreams.\u201d At 8 p.m., Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (866) 811-4111, chocolatefactorytheater.org; $15. (Burke)\n\u2605 Vuyani Dance Theater (Friday and Saturday) The work of Gregory Maqoma, who was born in Soweto, South Africa, and trained under Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker in Belgium, embodies African tradition and European contemporary dance. He founded Vuyani Dance Theater in 1999 as a vehicle to develop his own brand of contemporary African culture, combining storytelling, live music and spirited, rigorous movement. In the solo journey \u201cExit/Exist,\u201d Mr. Maqoma examines his ancestral past and the effects of colonialism. At 7:30 p.m., Kumble Theater for the Performing Arts, Long Island University, Brooklyn campus, Flatbush and DeKalb Avenues, Downtown Brooklyn, (718) 488-1624, 651arts.org; $20 to $25. (Schaefer)",

    "text": "Sunday Dialogue: More Regulation, or Less?\n2013-06-01T17:18:13.000Z\nReaders discuss government\u2019s proper role in the marketplace.\n\u00a0\nTo the Editor:\nIn a recent and bewildering article, The Times reported that Texans remain wary of government regulation even after a fertilizer explosion killed 14, one of the worst industrial disasters in decades. Even though Texas has the nation\u2019s worst record on workplace fatalities, businesses can \u201cdo pretty much what they want to,\u201d as one Texan observed.\nOur regulatory system is a flash point for many. Simply stated (and admittedly oversimplified), the anti-regulatory faction posits that the free market\u2019s \u201cinvisible hand\u201d takes care of itself and \u201cbad actors\u201d are eventually eliminated from the marketplace. Regulations, it contends, stifle business and innovation.\nOn the other side, proponents of regulation contend that unbridled capitalism inevitably leads to excess, fraud and harm. They trace a line from the Triangle shirtwaist fire to thalidomide-related birth defects to the 2008 financial crisis to the Bangladesh factory collapse. Effective regulations might have prevented those unfortunate events.\nRegulation \u2014 like beauty \u2014 is in the eyes of the beholder. There is no dispute that regulations carry increased costs and are sometimes excessive. Nonetheless, most believe that effective regulation is required and beneficial in a complex society.\nI recently attended the annual shareholders\u2019 meeting for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett\u2019s company. Mr. Buffett said, \u201cIt is in our self-interest to conduct our operations in a manner that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they represent.\u201d He understands, presumably, that such scrutiny is a legitimate price to pay to live in a society where legal rights are respected and enforced. Moreover, he understands that compliance is profitable.\nWhat is needed is more regulation and tighter enforcement. Moreover, businesses that do not comply should bear the economic consequences of their misdeeds. There should not be any caps on damages recoverable because only then will business do the right thing.\nThe laissez-faire doctrine developed in the 18th century is a relic not appropriate for the 21st century. Mr. Buffett understands that perfectly. Why don\u2019t others?\nMARC CHAFETZ Washington, May 27, 2013\nThe writer is a lawyer.\n\nReaders React\nTo steal from Winston Churchill, government regulation is the worst form of oversight, except for all others. In its absence we return to the days of robber barons, badly polluted water and air, unbridled corruption and greed on Wall Street, banks vulnerable to collapse, contaminated food, tainted drugs, unsafe air travel and deathtrap automobiles.\nRegulation is costly, inefficient and frustrating, and much better than the alternative. History proves conclusively that unregulated free markets are incapable of reining in the excesses of capitalism, which must be tempered through government meddling. It is ugly, but it works.\nJEFF SCHWEITZER Spicewood, Tex., May 30, 2013\n\u00a0\nThe United States has had a regulatory structure since its founding. History reveals that there are alternating cycles in which government is seen as a valuable and active partner in our social and economic lives, or as a serious problem to be avoided.\nWhat our research demonstrates, however, is that government regulation, of both the economy and the civic sphere, has enriched the lives of Americans throughout history. To be sure, we can point to an array of government failures, and those failures must be corrected either through reform or, when appropriate, deregulation.\nOver the last three decades, antigovernment rhetoric that extols markets and demonizes government has captured the public conversation. That rhetoric, however, is deeply flawed. Markets cannot exist without government support, whether it is to enforce a contract, protect the civil rights and civil liberties of the weakest among us, or establish and sustain competitive markets.\nThe real issue is not about the size of government or the amount of regulation; rather, the challenging issue is to find the right mix of government and markets in the name of the common good.\nJOSEPH P. TOMAIN SIDNEY A. SHAPIRO Cincinnati, May 29, 2013\nThe writers are professors at the University of Cincinnati College of Law and Wake Forest School of Law, respectively, and the authors of the forthcoming book \u201cAchieving Democracy.\u201d \n\u00a0\nMr. Chafetz overstates his case. The choice is not necessarily between more and less regulation. The choice should be between effective regulations, well enforced, and the confusing and poorly enforced system of regulations we have now (such as the tax code).\nHe states that \u201cwhat is needed is more regulation and tighter enforcement.\u201d Why is that? Is there no end to the number of regulations we need? There should be a cost-benefit analysis before enacting any new regulations. Advocates of endless regulations are attempting to achieve the impossible: perfection of society.\nAn example is my own profession of medicine. New regulations pour out of Congress like a flood, often with no provision to pay for them. Many are rooted in initially worthy goals, but ultimately, in an attempt at perfection, lead to diminishing returns for escalating costs in time, money and morale.\nJEFFREY A. RAPP Healdsburg, Calif., May 29, 2013\n\u00a0\nHistorically, regulation was perceived by advocates of small government as problematic for two main reasons. From a political perspective, it was seen as beyond the purview of what government should be doing, which ideally was nothing more than ensuring public order and stable money. From an economic perspective, it was seen as inefficient.\nIf regulation was intended to prevent the public from harm (for example, pollution, unsafe working conditions or hazardous products), litigation was construed as a more efficient way to ensure that outcome. The threat of having to pay damages to an injured party was to provide sufficient disincentive to industry to engage in unsafe practices.\nWhat is so disturbing about the tort reform movement, supported by industries and legislators that also rail against regulation, is that it leaves the public with no recourse against corporate excess. Not only are we subject to harm from unregulated industry, but awards for the damages we suffer are limited as well.\nCalls for tort reform and against regulation are not ideological, despite what right- and libertarian-leaning legislators affirm. They are cynical and antisocial.\nSHARI JACOBSON Selinsgrove, Pa., May 29, 2013\nThe writer is an associate professor of anthropology at Susquehanna University.\n\u00a0\nEven if markets discipline \u201cbad actors,\u201d we suffer severe repeat offenders, about whom the regulatory system fails. Think of BP\u2019s record of violations even before the Gulf of Mexico spill, or charter bus operators singled out by the secretary of transportation, or food producers that repeatedly jeopardize our health.\nMore than \u201cdamages recoverable\u201d is needed. Severe repeat offenders should be subject to receivership, replacing their boards or other management.\nROY A. SCHOTLAND Washington, May 29, 2013\nThe writer is professor emeritus at Georgetown Law Center.\n\u00a0\nAs Mr. Chafetz points out: \u201cThe anti-regulatory faction posits that the free market\u2019s \u2018invisible hand\u2019 takes care of itself and \u2018bad actors\u2019 are eventually eliminated from the marketplace. Regulations, it contends, stifle business and innovation.\u201d A self-serving argument if there ever was one.\nIf only the \u201cbad actors\u201d were harmed when conducting their business loosely, perhaps there would be some element of natural justice involved. But too often the irresponsible actions of \u201cbad actors\u201d hurt innocents, people with no opportunity to ensure that the business was conducted responsibly. Those are the people whom regulations are intended to protect. And they should be protected.\nDAVID M. BEHRMAN Houston, May 29, 2013\n\u00a0\nBusinesses pay for their misdeeds by losing customers and profits. Businesses should be held legally liable for damages they cause, but beyond that there is no need to involve the government in the process.\nIn general, there is no need for the government to be involved in any transactions that are entered into voluntarily; these transactions can be regulated by the buyer and the seller. The proper role of the government is to regulate where buyers and sellers do not. For example, residents of a town who may be exposed to danger by the building of a factory have a legitimate basis to involve themselves by means of government safety regulations. The same argument is the basis for environmental regulations that protect air and water from pollution.\nThe problem with the current state of government involvement in our daily lives is that the overwhelming majority of it \u2014 from employment regulations to \u201cconsumer protection\u201d laws to the Americans With Disabilities Act \u2014 is not regulation but interference, and we are drowning in it. There are legitimate areas for government regulation; if the government would focus on these and let the rest alone, it would do a better job of regulating, and we would all be better off.\nDENNIS CANFIELD Western Springs, Ill., May 29, 2013\n\u00a0\nMr. Chafetz wonders why so many people oppose lifesaving regulations. Since words powerfully shape our emotional responses, what if we substitute the word \u201cstandards\u201d for \u201cregulations\u201d?\n\u201cRegulation\u201d evokes feelings of constriction, constraint, holding back; so it is little wonder that many see regulation as a barrier to progress. The word \u201cstandards\u201d carries many positive associations as what most people aspire to uphold.\nThe term \u201cfuel efficiency standards,\u201d for example, carries a positive connotation to many, perhaps easing their upgrade passed last year. Might \u201cfuel efficiency regulations\u201d have suffered a different fate? Words have tremendous power.\nFRANCES MOORE LAPP\u00c9\nCambridge, Mass., May 29, 2013\nThe writer is the author of \u201cDiet for a Small Planet\u201d and other books.\n\u00a0\nRegulation is a reactive mechanism. It usually attempts to fix a problem that has already happened so that it doesn\u2019t happen again. It cannot predict the future, however, and therefore, cannot fix new problems before they happen.\nCivilization does advance, however, when regulation pushes society in new directions. Regulators pushed utilities to bury cables underground rather than hang them from poles, exposing them to the vicissitudes of the weather. Regulators pushed factories to clean up their smokestack emissions, leading to cleaner air. Regulators broke up the telephone monopoly, leading to competition and diversification in telecommunications.\nSo the problem, right now, is that the message about regulation is steeped in pessimism, and the optimists have been drowned out. When we acknowledge regulation\u2019s flaws, but adopt its hopeful guidance for the future, we will feel better about it as a nation.\nSTEVEN A. GLAZER Bowie, Md., May 29, 2013\nThe writer is an administrative law judge.\n\nThe Writer Responds\nMr. Schweitzer makes the case for regulation better than I did: Regulations can be ugly, but are nonetheless necessary to curb the inexorable excesses of the marketplace.\nProfessor Jacobson addresses the importance of litigation and business\u2019s risk of paying damages as a disincentive for unsafe practices. One problem, however, is that certain types of lawsuits have been eliminated by the Supreme Court (such as failure-to-warn suits against generic drug makers). This means that seriously injured people have no recourse.\nMr. Canfield\u2019s position \u2014 that buyers and sellers can regulate themselves reasonably \u2014 comes from a different planet than mine. I do not agree that we are drowning in regulations, especially employment regulations, consumer protection and the Americans With Disabilities Act. Many Americans from all political spectrums would agree that such laws and regulations have immeasurably improved this country.\nProfessor Schotland raises an intriguing idea for severe repeat offenders: that the company be placed in receivership and current management and board fired. Does anyone doubt that under such an approach unsafe conditions would plummet? This is also why there should not be any cap on damage awards.\nDr. Rapp makes a point that I had hoped was implicit in my letter \u2014 that there should be better regulations that are effectively enforced. The tax code would be a prime example for overhaul. Regarding his point about cost-benefit analysis, that is already the case under several statutes. Frankly, a danger is the likelihood that business would hire economists to \u201cdemonstrate\u201d why any new regulation was harmful.\nFor some time there has been an active campaign against government that is no doubt promoted and financed by business. Professors Tomain and Shapiro indicate that their research demonstrates the effectiveness of regulations for improving Americans\u2019 lives. They also point out that the success of American business is to a large extent attributable to the government\u2019s support.\nMARC CHAFETZ Washington, May 31, 2013",

    "text": "Sunday Dialogue: How Goods Are Produced\n2013-05-11T17:24:08.000Z\nUnsafe factory conditions overseas: who is culpable?\n\u00a0\nTo the Editor:\nThe building collapse in Bangladesh last month was the latest in a long series of preventable tragedies in the garment industry. Blame quickly extended from the owners of the building and the factories it contained, to the government of Bangladesh, to the retailers who sold the clothing. But the culpability extends all the way down the supply chain \u2014 to us.\nOur willingness to buy garments sewn under dangerous conditions, chocolate made from cocoa picked by captive children, or cellphones and laptops containing \u201cconflict minerals\u201d from Congo create the demand that underwrites these tragedies.\nAfter a generation of outsourcing and globalization, corporations in many industries are often merely the last step in a long chain of suppliers and assemblers. As a result, the companies whose brands are on the product often have little idea of what might have occurred two steps back.\nEven the biggest electronics companies have had to mobilize substantial effort to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s requirement to report their use of conflict minerals. The tech giant Hewlett-Packard is four steps upstream from the smelters that buy and refine the minerals that ultimately end up in its products. By locating and publicizing the identity of these smelters, H.P. intends to enable its suppliers to verify that their parts are conflict-free.\nShareholder pressures are unlikely to reduce unsafe practices in the supply chain. In the seven months after The Times published an expos\u00e9 about safety problems in the iPad\u2019s supply chain, Apple\u2019s stock market value increased by over $200 billion, making it the most valuable corporation in history. Investors apparently had little reason to question Apple\u2019s supplier practices.\nIf we want to see fewer tragedies like the one in Bangladesh, we as consumers need to reward the companies that make the effort to verify their supply chains and shun those that do not. Make it unprofitable to be unsafe.\nJERRY DAVIS Ann Arbor, Mich., May 6, 2013\nThe writer is a professor of management at the Ross School of Business, University of Michigan.\n\nReaders React\nI appreciate Mr. Davis\u2019s putting pressure on consumers to put pressure on corporations that turn a blind eye toward abuse of people and the planet in the interest of profit-making. Yes, in our quest for cheap disposable items from clothing to cellphones, we care not how these items were made \u2014 although we shriek (momentarily) when the next factory collapses.\nHowever, the problem is bigger than this. For one thing, consumers face limitations in their ability to respond. It\u2019s hard to gain information about the conditions in a factory where one\u2019s product is made, and even if we had this info, where can most consumers purchase fairly made items?\nThe larger system \u2014 with its pressure to reward shareholders and failure to penalize companies that exploit others or the environment \u2014 has few incentives to reward good corporate behavior.\nFor myself, I have divested from the stock market; reduced purchases to the minimum while seeking out previously owned and/or fairly made items whenever possible; spread the word in schools and other settings about these abuses; and taken groups abroad to visit our struggling neighbors and ecosystems and to consider the connections between our lives and theirs. The nonprofit organization that I head supports the empowerment of girls and women in other countries to be successful within their own economies, as the global system always tends toward exploitation.\nDAVID RADCLIFF Director, New Community Project Peoria, Ariz., May 8, 2013\n\u00a0\nNo, Mr. Davis, the culprit in the Bangladesh collapse is not \u201cus.\u201d And it certainly is not me, in particular.\nThirty years ago, I spent several years working in consumer products marketing and realized even back then \u2014 before \u201cfree trade,\u201d before \u201coffshoring,\u201d before \u201cglobalization\u201d \u2014 that profits come through exploiting whatever assets, human or otherwise, can be exploited; slapping disclaimers on any contract, products or actions that can result in liabilities; shifting responsibility when things go wrong; and simultaneously pumping out marketing and press materials that gloss over these cynical practices.\nSo, no, Mr. Davis, speaking for \u201cus,\u201d I resent being held responsible for Bangladesh. The fault lies squarely with executives much higher up the chain, the honchos in government, the regulatory agencies, industry, and the financial and legal sectors. They knew what they were doing, or at the very least, they have no excuse for not knowing.\nBARBARA E. GOODMAN Ottawa Hills, Ohio, May 8, 2013\n\u00a0\nProfessor Davis is right to say that consumers need to reward companies that take responsibility for conditions in factories producing their products. But he sets the bar too low. He proposes that consumers should reward companies merely because they \u201cmake the effort to verify their supply chains.\u201d This is not enough, and simply monitoring individual factory conditions is only a first step.\nInstead, consumers should reward those global companies that make a long-term commitment to stay in poor countries like Bangladesh, to work with their competitors to develop and implement practical industry standards on worker safety and other human rights, and then to make a collective commitment to press but also assist local governments as they struggle to uphold these minimum standards.\nMICHAEL POSNER New York, May 8, 2013\nThe writer is a professor at the New York University Stern School of Business.\n\u00a0\nMr. Davis suggests that we use our power as consumers to change labor practices. But in a world of Walmart wages, Walmart prices are actually all most people can afford. Those in low-wage jobs themselves don\u2019t have the luxury of paying more for clothing made under decent working conditions. It\u2019s a race to the bottom, here and there.\nIf the blatant repression of labor organizing in Bangladesh were to stop, workers would have the power to represent their own interests. And similarly, in this country, if employers like Walmart were to be penalized for their anti-union repression, American workers could afford to make purchasing decisions based on human rights.\nELIZABETH ORAM New York, May 8, 2013\n\u00a0\nI remember not eating grapes for many months during the farm workers\u2019 boycott led by Cesar Chavez in the late 1960s. After five years the national boycott worked to improve the conditions and hourly wages of those who toiled in the fields.\nConsumers need to reduce demand by only 10 to 15 percent to ultimately effect meaningful change. Just as consumers need to \u201cmake it unprofitable to be unsafe,\u201d we must demand that multinationals do the same by rewarding suppliers that abide by prescribed guidelines and shunning those that do not.\nBARBARA ALLEN KENNEY Santa Fe, N.M., May 8, 2013\n\u00a0\nStudies show that American consumers will pay more for clothing and toys if they can be assured they are made under decent conditions. Today, however, over 95 percent of the clothing and most toys sold in the United States are made overseas, primarily in Asian sweatshops. Companies like Walmart, Disney and The Gap demand that their overseas subcontractors produce goods at minimal cost, guaranteeing dangerous working conditions and below-poverty wages.\nIf these hugely profitable global companies required suppliers to double wages and provide safe factories, and passed on these costs to consumers, price increases would be negligible. For example, the Worker Rights Consortium estimates a total cost of $3 billion to improve Bangladesh\u2019s 5,000 factories to Western safety standards, adding less than 10 cents to the factory price of the garments made for global brands.\nThe Obama administration should call a summit meeting of American apparel companies, unions, and consumer and human rights group to demand that the companies raise pay and workplace standards, allow employees to unionize, and submit to regular monitoring by a neutral nonprofit organization that would issue a \u201creport card\u201d on each company\u2019s behavior for consumers to use in deciding what to purchase.\nPETER DREIER Los Angeles, May 9, 2013\nThe writer is chairman of the urban and environmental policy department at Occidental College. \n\u00a0\nThe public discourse relating to the recent building collapse in Bangladesh killing hundreds of factory workers has been devoid of one essential component: the state.\u00a0Instead, nearly all that has been discussed involves either the extent to which a parent corporation should be responsible for the acts and omissions of subsidiary corporations, or the responsibilities of Western consumers.\u00a0\nUnder international human rights law, each state has the responsibility not to commit human rights violations itself, but it also has the responsibility \u2014 a legal responsibility \u2014 to ensure that private entities, including corporations, do not violate human rights standards.\u00a0What is evident from the tragedy in Bangladesh and many of the other workplace violations such as those involving Apple is that the state has utterly failed to meet these international obligations.\nBut the most vexing question is which states bear responsibility for this protection.\u00a0Under the traditional approach, such responsibility would lie exclusively with the territorial state \u2014 in this case Bangladesh.\u00a0However, there has been a growing recognition that in the absence of human rights protection by the \u201chost\u201d state, a multinational corporation\u2019s \u201chome\u201d state must act to ensure that one of its entities does not violate human rights standards in other lands.\u00a0 Thus, not only has Bangladesh failed to meet its human rights obligations, but so too have a number of \u201chome\u201d countries, including the United States.\nMARK GIBNEY Asheville, N.C., May 8, 2013\nThe writer is a professor at the University of North Carolina-Asheville and a founding member of the Extraterritorial Obligations Human Rights Consortium.\n\u00a0\nI confess \u2014 I own Apple products. Through innovative design and marketing, Apple has convinced me that I need its products, and thus the controversies over its overseas manufacturers, like Foxconn, weigh less heavily in mind. Also, as a prudent consumer, I buy regular apples from a chain grocery store instead of fair-trade, organic apples from a local food cooperative.\nAs consumers, we do what psychologists call \u201cmoral disengagement.\u201d We continue to buy things we like because we convince ourselves that it is not our responsibility to deal with supply chain problems or that the consequences of such problems are not severe. Recent research found that if consumers desire a product, they are motivated to justify sweatshop labor as less immoral. Because I love Apple products and regular apples, I morally disengage from supply chain ethics.\nWhile consumers certainly have a role in forcing companies\u2019 accountability, it is unwise to place the entire burden on us.\nMADELINE ONG Ann Arbor, Mich., May 8, 2013\n\u00a0\nHaving invested a 40-year career in the retail and wholesale industry, I support Mr. Davis\u2019s comments. The retail competition in the United States has fostered an environment of constant pressure on suppliers to reduce wholesale pricing. If a wholesaler refuses, his future is sealed. The pressure moves up the supply chain, and the result, as we have witnessed in India and Bangladesh, can be tragic.\nRetailers\u2019 vows to take the steps needed to ensure worker safety take money. Wholesalers cannot enforce safety practices unless their customers (the retailers) are willing to pay for more for the product. Ultimately, this translates to higher retail prices.\nThe responsibility for worker safety worldwide rests with the consumer worldwide. If we think it does not, we are electing to ignore our own complicity in these tragedies.\nDARYL DAVIS Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., May 8, 2013\n\u00a0\nEven if workable, Mr. Davis\u2019s proposal would have limited impact. It does nothing to address the millions of workers in the developing world who toil in factories that produce goods for local markets or agricultural laborers who handle pesticide-infused products.\nThe root cause of the tragedy in Bangladesh is poverty and corruption. Petty corruption allows building inspectors to look the other way and labor officials to let preteens work in unsafe conditions. Poverty forces laborers to work in appalling conditions.\nAlas, addressing the multiple causes of poverty is a long-term project, but one that must be pursued nonetheless.\nMICHAEL A. RUGH Lake in the Hills, Ill., May 8, 2013\n\u00a0\nIn 1911, after the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire, the New York State Legislature appointed a Factory Investigating Commission, whose chairman was State Senator Robert F. Wagner. He saw firsthand the results of a one-sided industrial relations regime that uniformly favored factory owners at the expense of workers\u2019 rights, workers\u2019 safety \u2014 and, in too many cases, their very lives.\nTwenty-four years later, as a United States senator, Mr. Wagner successfully sponsored the National Labor Relations Act, which codifies the right of workers to organize unions of their own choosing.\nMr. Wagner\u2019s central insight is as true now as it was then: You can never hire enough inspectors to inspect every workplace at every time something might go wrong. But workers are already there and know quite well where the hazards are and how to prevent them.\nWhether in Bangladesh or the boroughs of New York, self-government in the workplace remains the surest way to balance the awesome power of employers \u2014 and the best safety program ever invented.\nROGER KERSON Ann Arbor, Mich., May 8, 2013\nThe writer is a media consultant for labor, environmental and nonprofit organizations.\u00a0\n\nThe Writer Responds\nShould consumers feel any responsibility for how the goods they buy are produced? Ms. Goodman says no \u2014 that executives and officials higher up the chain are responsible, not us. But why should the buck stop with a retailer that buys from a wholesaler that buys from a brand licensee that sources from Bangladesh? The retailer is three steps removed from factory conditions; we are four.\nWe can choose to ignore distant tragedies, but our purchases keep the machinery in motion. In a Web-enabled world, ignorance is a feeble excuse: if you can use a search engine, you can quickly research which brands oversee safe practices and make the long-term commitment that Professor Posner describes, and which do not.\nCan consumers do anything to promote changed business practices? Ms. Kenney mentions the grape boycott that ultimately changed the working conditions of farm laborers in California. Consumers today have the capacity to change the landscape for nearly every product they buy \u2014 particularly the affluent demographic that reads The Times. There are free apps on the Web that allow us to identify responsible products (such as GoodGuide), and some grocers post the provenance of their fresh foods.\nIf enough of us commit to following such ratings, it will shape business behavior \u2014 particularly among the branded products that depend on their reputation.\nIs this enough to change the dynamics of the global economy and alleviate poverty around the world? Not without vast structural changes. Scrupulous governments and empowered labor have always been essential for ensuring worker rights and safety. But consumer choices are the motive force, and we control what we buy. Some brands and retailers are already taking the lead here. Organics moved from high-end niche product to Walmart staple; why not products made under just conditions?\nJERRY DAVIS Ann Arbor, Mich., May 9, 2013",
