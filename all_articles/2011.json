    "text": "Working in the Himalayas to Prevent Disastrous Flooding\n2011-11-27T13:21:07.000Z\nNEW DELHI \u2014 With its massive chalk-white face of ice and snow, Thorthormi glacier in northern Bhutan looms high against a bright blue sky, nearly 4,450 meters above sea level. At the glacier\u2019s base, a wide lake of murky water completes the dramatic scene at the rooftop of the world. \nBut the beauty of the majestic landscape hides a threat. Thorthormi\u2019s swelling glacial lake is expanding at an alarming rate as the surrounding ice bed melts 30 to 35 meters, or 100 to 165 feet, a year. \nBecause of warmer temperatures attributed to climate change, Thorthormi lake has nearly tripled in size since 2001, to 3.42 square kilometers, or 1.32 square miles, while the natural moraine dam of rocks containing it has shrunk to half its height, according to the environmental group W.W.F.\nIf the moraine around Thorthormi lake collapses, as many as 14 million gallons, or 53 million liters, of water, rocks and debris would gush through nearby valleys, affecting tens of thousands of people and destroying their livelihoods. The surrounding area is home to 10 percent of Bhutan\u2019s 700,000 people and constitutes about 8 percent of its arable land, in a country that relies heavily on agriculture. \nIn a worse case, Thorthormi lake would breach a narrow moraine and merge with Rapshteng, an enormous adjacent glacial lake, and unleash a catastrophic torrent of water through Bhutan. \nA glacial lake outburst flood, or GLOF, of Thorthormi lake would devastate not only Bhutan but also communities downstream, with flooding very likely in neighboring India and Bangladesh. \nGLOFs are just one of the big threats from climate change in the Himalayas. There are also grave long-term consequences of melting glaciers. Himalayan glaciers, the world\u2019s second-largest source of fresh water, after the polar ice caps, are shrinking at a rate of 30 to 60 meters a decade, the United Nations Development Program estimates. Yet these \u201cwater towers\u201d of Asia feed seven of the continent\u2019s major rivers, including the Yangtze, Ganges, Indus and Mekong, upon which 1.3 billion people depend. \nReduced flow of fresh water from shrinking Himalayan glaciers across Pakistan, China, Nepal, India and Bhutan could create water shortages in the world\u2019s most populous region. \nTo address multiple threats from climate change, Bhutan hosted a summit meeting of Himalayan countries on Nov. 19 in Thimphu, its capital. Government officials from India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan attended the meeting, along with aid agencies, donors, NGOs and environmentalists, to discuss ways to mitigate risks to food security, water, energy and biodiversity. \nThey sought to create a collective 10-year blueprint to cope with the reality of climate change in the region. While Bangladesh is far from the snowcaps of the Himalayas, its low-lying position as a basin for 56 major rivers makes it especially vulnerable to changes among its mountainous neighbors. \n\u201cClimate change is a shared problem, and regions bound by common issues and geographical boundaries should coordinate efforts to deal with its impact,\u201d said Dr. Lyonpo Pema Gyamtsho, Bhutan\u2019s minister for agriculture and forests. \nSo-called least developed countries like Bhutan and Bangladesh account for a tiny fraction of the greenhouse gas emissions responsible for global warming. But poor countries like them will bear the brunt of climate change because of their geography and lack of money and technology to protect themselves. \nAs delegates gathered at the U.N. summit meeting in Durban, the far smaller Himalayan climate summit served as a proactive way to address pressing issues in the region. Bhutan \u201ccannot wait for a global agreement to reduce emissions,\u201d said Jorgen Thomsen, director of conservation at the Chicago-based MacArthur Foundation, one of the meeting\u2019s partners. \u201cThey need to act now, and are doing so. They are setting an example for how the global community must work together. \u201d \nThe forward-thinking approach is in keeping with Bhutan\u2019s emphasis on protecting its environment and culture during its recent modernization. The former kingdom was closed to the outside world until the 1970s; it lifted a ban on television and the Internet only in 1999. \nIt has modernized politically, too. Bhutan willingly abandoned its centuries-old monarchic rule in 2008. It has pledged to conserve 60 percent of its territory as forest, and 40 percent as national parks and protected areas. \nWhile it could have flung open its doors to lucrative foreign tourism like Nepal, Bhutan aims to cap tourists and protect its environment by requiring visitors to spend a minimum of $200 a day (including hotel and other expenses). Conserving the environment is part of Bhutan\u2019s \u201cgross happiness index,\u201d a holistic measure of quality of life there. \nSince Bhutan has no power to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, it must mitigate the ill effects of climate change. Herculean efforts to shrink Thorthormi lake are one example. \nEach year since 2009, more than 300 Bhutanese have trekked 10 days to reach the remote Thorthormi glacier to drain its lake. Heavy equipment cannot be carried to the avalanche-prone site so horses and yaks haul supplies. There, male and female workers use ropes, shovels and sheer muscle to move boulders and dig a channel to drain the lake. \nThe high-altitude conditions at Thorthormi claimed several lives last year. But so far the three expeditions, backed by government support and international financing from the U.N.D.P., W.W.F. and other agencies, have lowered water levels in the lake by 3.63 meters, staving off what seemed like an imminent GLOF in 2010. Project leaders hope to reduce water levels by a total of 5 meters in 2012. \nIn another example of climate change mitigation, an early warning system has been established near Thorthormi lake to alert locals of floods. If water levels rise, sensors activate and trip an alarm at a control station. Sirens blare to warn locals to relocate to evacuation sites. The station would communicate updates to government officials, including Bhutan\u2019s Department of Disaster Management. Officials, in turn, would convey information to locals via pre-distributed mobile phones. \nThe early warning system is equipped with 17 sirens, four automatic water level stations, three automatic weather stations and a control station manned 24 hours a day. It shares water level information with the neighboring Indian states of Assam and West Bengal, which are prone to downstream flooding. \nThe Himalayan summit meeting sought to forge more regional cooperation of this kind. But the challenges remain immense. There are 2,600 glacial lakes in Bhutan; Thorthormi is the largest and most dangerous, but another 82 are deemed to be growing risks. \nIn addition to glacial floods, Himalayan countries have to battle other severe consequences of climate change. unpredictable rains; rising temperatures that affect crops and promote pests; and expanding or receding forests that endanger animal habitats. \nIn the far reaches of Bhutan, it is not enough for locals to move mountain lakes. Vulnerable Himalayan countries need more resources to tackle climate change, said Dr. Gyamtsho, Bhutan\u2019s minister of agriculture and forests. Otherwise \u201cBhutan may yet be fighting a losing war to save the planet and humanity, despite winning some minor battles locally.\u201d ",

    "text": "Flood of Fleeing Migrants Eases at Tunisian Border Crossing\n2011-03-05T02:02:09.000Z\nRAS AJDIR BORDER CROSSING, Tunisia \u0097 The flow of migrant workers fleeing Libya into Tunisia slowed drastically on Thursday and Friday, but aid workers said they worried the decline could mean that Libyan officials were harassing or blocking workers who wanted to leave the country.\nAbout 1,800 migrants crossed from Libya into Tunisia on Thursday, down from as many as 15,000 daily arrivals earlier in the week, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. A similar number crossed Friday, many of them immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa.\nRefugees who made it to Tunisia said they had to cross military checkpoints, where they endured searches and often the confiscation of telephones, cameras and electronic memory cards before being allowed to leave Libya. More than a million foreign workers are thought to remain in Libya, and many are presumed to be seeking to escape, given the country\u2019s continuing turmoil.\n\u201cWe find it very odd that the numbers have fallen so dramatically in the last couple of days,\u201d said Melissa Fleming, a spokeswoman for the refugee agency. She noted that phone calls to the agency from foreigners seeking help had not declined despite the drop in numbers of those making it to Tunisia.\nInside Libya, \u201ceverything is shut down,\u201d she said, adding that without work migrants had little reason to stay.\nAt the border crossing here, migrants said dozens of military checkpoints lined the roads west of Tripoli, all of them operated by pro-government forces who have been systematically confiscating electronic devices.\n\u201cFrom what people have told us,\u201d said Ms. Fleming, those forces \u201cdon\u2019t want any pictures getting out, and they want a certain picture of what\u2019s going on inside.\u201d \nSome migrants have told aid workers with the International Organization for Migration that \u201ccertain people have been retained\u201d at checkpoints, said Jean-Philippe Chauzy, an agency spokesman. \n\u201cI still don\u2019t understand why certain people are being stopped and others not,\u201d Mr. Chauzy added.\nHe said he worried about the tens of thousands of sub-Saharan Africans thought to remain in Libya, where they have long been treated as an underclass.\n\u201cThe vast majority of them are still there, inside,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause they can\u2019t leave their homes, because they\u2019re scared.\u201d\nMany of the refugees in Tunisia were reluctant to recount specific episodes of violence, but described Libya as descending into lawless chaos.\n\u201cI lost the life I had, so I came here,\u201d said El Sedik Yahya Mohammed, 26, a tall Sudanese man in a black leather jacket, bleached jeans and dusty white loafers. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what our future would have been.\u201d\nHe and a dozen other Sudanese fled from Zawiyah, the northwestern city where soldiers loyal to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi fought to wrest control from rebel forces on Friday. Pro-government forces at several checkpoints outside the city confiscated the migrant workers\u2019 cellphone memory cards and erased telephone messages, Mr. Yahya Mohammed said.\n\u201cThose are their orders,\u201d he said. But the soldiers had made no attempt to block them from leaving, he said. \nWhile pressure eased at the border crossing on Friday, the situation grew more difficult at the transit camp four miles up the road as migrants arrived there in droves from the border station. Nearly 10,000 Bangladeshi workers, their bulging suitcases dragging behind them or balancing on their heads, made the trek in the dusty gravel along the roadside on Friday.\nWhile food, water and tents were plentiful at the camp, and more supplies continued to be shipped in by governments and international aid organizations, sanitation was posing a growing problem as trash and human waste piled up; the site had only about a dozen latrines. Unicef was to ship in several dozen toilets in the coming days, and other groups were seeking to provide more for the 12,500 migrants thought to be at the camp or the border crossing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting worse and worse,\u201d said Fay\u00e7al Dchicha, a worker with the International Organization for Migration and the head of a local Tunisian development organization. \u201cAnd we have to expect more arrivals.\u201d\nAbout 210,000 people have fled Libya since protests set off violent repression there last month, according to estimates from the United Nations. More than 95,000 have passed into Tunisia, and slightly fewer into Egypt. About 4,500 have fled to the south and west, crossing the borders with Algeria and Niger.\nAirlift operations coordinated by European governments and international aid groups continued Friday, repatriating thousands as the United States sent two planes loaded with aid, including blankets, plastic sheeting and water containers, according to the State Department.",

    "text": "Bangladesh Bans Sale of Palm Sap After an Unusually Lethal Oubreak\n2011-03-21T22:30:53.000Z\nBangladesh is suffering an outbreak of deadly Nipah virus, causing the government to adopt an unusual prevention tactic: a ban on the sale of fresh palm sap.\nThe virus, carried by bats, was identified\u00a0only in 1999.\u00a0 It causes dangerous brain inflammation in humans and is infectious.\u00a0The Bangladeshi outbreak is unusually lethal, killing 35 of the 40 people known to have been infected.\nThe first known outbreak of Nipah virus was in Malaysia, where most victims raised or butchered pigs that were the source of infection. The pigs are believed to have rooted beneath bat colonies in trees, eating food contaminated by droppings. But the Bangladesh outbreak happened without a swine vector.\nBangladeshis like drinking date palm sap, which is gathered \u201cin a way similar to maple syrup collection,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan\u00a0H. Epstein, a veterinarian with the EcoHealth Alliance, which is helping Bangladesh track the virus.\u00a0\nGatherers called gachis climb high into the trees, shave the bark with machetes and hang clay pots on the trunks to collect the sap at night. Large fruit bats called Indian flying foxes are attracted and lap up the running sap, sometimes fouling the pots with their saliva, urine or feces.\nMany people in the tropics leave palm sap to ferment into wine \u2014 and fermentation might kill the virus.\u00a0 But most Bangladeshis are Muslim, and do not drink alcohol, Dr. Epstein said.\nThe government health agency\u00a0is also trying to persuade the gachis to put what he called \u201cbamboo skirts\u201d over the mouths of their\u00a0collecting jars.\n\u201cThe gachis like them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey keep the stuff pure, so they can sell it for more.\u201d",

    "text": "Microcredit Pioneer Faces an Inquiry in Bangladesh\n2011-01-29T15:41:53.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u0097 Any other year Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and a pioneer of microcredit, would be in Davos, Switzerland, this week. For years he has been celebrated at global gatherings like the World Economic Forum there for helping move millions of impoverished women toward a better life through tiny but transformational loans. \nInstead, he was in court again on Thursday, facing accusations, considered frivolous by most accounts, that one of his nonprofit companies adulterated vitamin-fortified yogurt. On Jan. 18, he was summoned to a rural courtroom to face charges of defamation lodged by a local politician.\nMicrocredit, the idea that Mr. Yunus popularized as a path out of penury for those long excluded from the banking system, has increasingly come under scrutiny. Scholars have cast doubt on its effectiveness in fighting poverty, and politicians and other critics accuse microfinanciers, many of whom, unlike Mr. Yunus, profit from the loans, of getting rich off the poor. \nNow, the government of Bangladesh has ordered a wide-ranging inquiry into the microfinance institution he founded 34 years ago, Grameen Bank, after a Norwegian documentary accused him of mishandling donors\u2019 money. Norway\u2019s government has said no money was misused. Still, Mr. Yunus\u2019s troubles will deepen what has become a global crisis in microfinance that threatens to undermine the very concept \u0097 small loans to poor people without collateral \u0097 on which his reputation rests. \nLong accustomed to adulation at home and abroad, suddenly, at 70, Mr. Yunus, Bangladesh\u2019s best-known citizen, finds himself very much on the defensive. In an interview at his office here, Mr. Yunus seemed stunned and deeply stung. \n\u201cThere is some kind of misinformation,\u201d he said, his voice trailing off. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t say more.\u201d \nA pause. \n\u201cEvery word I say will be held against me,\u201d he said finally. \nOn one level, his troubles seem to be largely political. Mr. Yunus, who leads a spartan life, has for decades floated well above the muck of Bangladeshi politics. Then in 2007, while a caretaker government backed by the military ruled Bangladesh, he waded in, egged on by supporters who argued that his leadership was needed in a time of crisis. \nHe declared in an interview that Bangladeshi politics were riddled with corruption. He floated a short-lived political party. Bangladesh\u2019s political class did not take kindly to being lectured by the Nobel laureate. The steely leader of one of the main political parties, Sheikh Hasina Wazed, took umbrage, analysts say. \nIn the 2008 election that restored democracy after a two-year interregnum, Ms. Hasina led her party, the Awami League, back power with a vast majority. Her critics say that in lashing out at Mr. Yunus she is simply trying to eliminate a political rival. \nBut lost in the talk of politics is a more complex question: how to ensure that Grameen Bank, which has 8.3 million borrowers, has loaned $10 billion and has become an indispensable part of Bangladesh\u2019s social and economic fabric, outlives its charismatic founder? Mr. Yunus is now a decade beyond the bank\u2019s mandatory retirement age, and apparently there is no successor in sight. \nLong-serving internal candidates that might have replaced Mr. Yunus as the bank\u2019s managing director after his retirement have departed acrimoniously. \nThe government recently appointed one of his former deputies, Muzammel Huq, as chairman of the board. Mr. Huq has been a vocal critic of Mr. Yunus, and the promotion of a former underling has been taken as a sure sign that the government seeks to oust the bank\u2019s founder. \n\u201cI think he is a good man with a small heart,\u201d Mr. Huq said of Mr. Yunus. \u201cHe cannot give credit to anyone but himself,\u201d he added, with a wan smile at his pun.\nMicrofinance experts worry that a government takeover of Grameen Bank may turn it into a tool of political patronage and destroy it. Mr. Yunus said that he was eager to step down, but that the transition must be handled carefully to avoid panic among borrowers and the bank\u2019s employees. \n\u201cI am riding the tiger,\u201d Mr. Yunus said. \u201cI cannot just get off the tiger without drawing the attention of that tiger. So I have to very quietly do it.\u201d\nThe Norwegian documentary accuses him of improperly moving $100 million that has been donated by Norway for microcredit to another Grameen nonprofit organization. The Norwegian government later confirmed that the money had been improperly moved, but it cleared Grameen of any wrongdoing. \n\u201cThere is no indication that Norwegian funds have been used for unintended purposes, or that Grameen Bank has engaged in corrupt practices or embezzled funds,\u201d Erik Solheim, the Norwegian minister for environment and international development, said in a statement. \nBangladeshi government officials say they are worried that the handling of the Norwegian money may point to broader problems at Grameen. Mahbubul Mokaddem Akash, an economist at the University of Dhaka who has been critical of Grameen Bank, said that while Mr. Yunus might be personally incorruptible, the bank needed strong governing practices and transparency if it was to thrive once its charismatic founder departed. \n\u201cThe main focus should not be on personal corruption but on prudential management of the institution,\u201d Mr. Akash said. \n Grameen Bank is different from private microfinance companies that have come into disrepute in recent years, accused of charging exorbitant interest rates and being too aggressive in making loans and collecting payments. Grameen is owned largely by its borrowers, who share its profits. The Bangladeshi government owns 25 percent of the bank and appoints two board members and the chairman of the board. \nThe board is largely made up of poor, uneducated women who are Grameen borrowers. They lack the skills and experience to oversee its complex operations, critics say. Mr. Yunus has tried, unsuccessfully, to get himself appointed as chairman of the board so that he could continue to oversee the bank after retiring from running it. The government has refused.\nBut questions about how Grameen Bank operates have been drowned out in the acrimonious, deeply personal politics of Bangladesh. Ms. Hasina, who had been a supporter of Grameen and microcredit, accused microfinance lenders in December of \u201csucking blood from the poor.\u201d \nMs. Hasina has long resented Mr. Yunus\u2019s success, analysts here say, worried that he will emerge as a political rival. As early as 1996, when Ms. Hasina became prime minister for the first time, she wanted to reduce the independence of Grameen Bank and its founder, according to a senior bureaucrat who worked for her at that time. \n\u201cShe wanted a shuffle of the bank\u2019s leadership,\u201d the bureaucrat said, speaking anonymously for fear of retribution. \nIt got worse when Mr. Yunus received his Nobel Peace Prize in 2006. With the main opposition party, the Bangladesh National Party, divided and weakened, Ms. Hasina had come to see him as a major political threat. \n\u201cShe is afraid that another military government will come and try to use Yunus as its face,\u201d said a retired senior government official who worked closely with Ms. Hasina but who feared being punished if identified. \u201cShe wants to tarnish his image so that he becomes less of a threat.\u201d \nBut Mr. Yunus\u2019s supporters are upset that his legacy, so carefully built over decades of serving the poor, has been so swiftly called into question. \n\u201cThis man has done so much for the country,\u201d said Mahfuz Anam, editor of The Daily Star, a leading English-language newspaper. \u201cHe does not deserve to be treated this way because of dirty politics.\u201d ",

    "text": "Grandmotherly Bangladesh Leader Unfazed by Problems at Home\n2011-09-24T02:03:07.000Z\nWhile Bangladesh\u2019s prime minister has been attending the United Nations this week, stock market investors back home rioted over steep losses, the police arrested hundreds of Islamist protesters and the main political opposition party threatened a general strike for Saturday, when it is her turn to speak at the annual General Assembly.\nThe prime minister, Sheikh Hasina Wazed, appeared unfazed.\nA stern grandmother figure with a calm voice and cool gray eyes, Mrs. Hasina, who turns 64 this month, has survived far worse in her rollercoaster political career in Bangladesh, one of the world\u2019s most impoverished countries, with a history of political chaos and military interventions over much of the 40 years since it won independence from Pakistan. \nHer father was Bangladesh\u2019s most important independence leader. He, her mother and three brothers were assassinated at home by gunmen in 1975. Mrs. Hasina, a career politician herself, has been the target of multiple assassination attempts. She suffered hearing damage because of an explosion from a grenade meant to kill her in 2004. She is no stranger to house arrest, prison and conspiracy plots. In 2009, two months into her current term as prime minister, she faced a bloody revolt by border guards in her own military.\nToday, she says, Bangladesh, a Muslim-majority nation of 150 million, is far more stable, and support for secular democracy has taken hold. \u201cWe are doing well,\u201d she said in an interview at her hotel, dressed in the customary Bengali sari that covers her head, with a portrait of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, on the wall behind her. \nIn December 2008, after the last military emergency was lifted, Mrs. Hasina\u2019s political party, the Awami League, swept to power in parliamentary elections, with a large majority over the rival Bangladesh Nationalist Party. \u201cWe had a great victory,\u201d she said.\nHer government has been criticized, however, for failing to curb abuses by the police and the military, in particular an elite anticrime force known as the Rapid Action Battalion. Last May, Human Rights Watch said the force had killed nearly 200 people since January 2009. \nMrs. Hasina has also been criticized for government intimidation of Bangladeshi journalists who report unfavorable news. \u201cPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina\u2019s government has a record of not tolerating criticism from the media,\u201d Bob Dietz, the Asia program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, said when a Dhaka news editor was arrested this summer after reporting on government corruption.\nAt the same time, Bangladesh under Mrs. Hasina has achieved one of the strongest economic growth rates, 6 percent annually, despite the global recession. She has sought to nurture friendly relations with Pakistan and India, her mutually suspicious, nuclear-armed neighbors. She has promoted education, health care and political empowerment for women. And she has enforced a zero-tolerance policy toward the type of violent religious extremism that, she says, was permitted by the BNP when it was in power.\n\u201cOur position is very clear \u2014 we will not allow terrorist activities in our country,\u201d she said. \u201cOur people are against this. That is why they voted for us.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, when President Obama greeted Mrs. Hasina at a General Assembly reception, he said, \u201cYou and your government are doing an excellent job in empowering women and countering terrorism,\u201d according to members of the Bangladesh delegation who were present. Mr. Obama also accepted her invitation to visit Bangladesh. \nIn a speech earlier in the week at the Asia Society in New York, Mrs. Hasina extolled the advantages of investing in Bangladesh, enumerating its rising-star status in appraisals by Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan. \u201cWe are pleased that our efforts to become an investment-friendly country are slowly being recognized,\u201d she said.\nIn the interview, she showed little concern about a stock-market riot in Dhaka, the capital, a few days earlier, when investors unhappy over sharp price drops smashed cars and torched tires near the stock exchange. Nor did she seem concerned about the BNP\u2019s latest general strike threat, nor about a police crackdown on protesters angered over the prosecution of senior officials of Jamaat-e-Islami, the country\u2019s largest Islamist religious party, by a tribunal investigating atrocities carried out in the country\u2019s independence struggle in 1971.\n\u201cThe police had to take action,\u201d she said, not seeming to give it a further thought.\nHer demeanor turned a bit testier, however, when asked about her relationship with Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and the founder of Grameen Bank, a pioneer of microfinance \u2014 the granting of tiny loans to the poor.\nShe and Mr. Yunus, once close colleagues, had a falling out in 2010 after negative publicity from a Norwegian documentary that accused Mr. Yunus of improperly moving a $100 million donation from Norway to an affiliate. The money was re-transferred afterward and Mr. Yunus was never accused of wrongdoing. \nBut scrutiny of him and of Grameen in the Bangladeshi media intensified as a result. Mrs. Hasina said Mr. Yunus had violated other banking rules, and that many Grameen loan recipients, meanwhile, were unable to pay off loans. She has accused him of \u201csucking blood from the poor in the name of poverty alleviation,\u201d which he denies.\nLast April, Mr. Yunus lost a legal battle in the Bangladesh courts to retain his job as managing director of the bank, and has criticized Mrs. Hasina and other Bangladeshi politicians. \nMrs. Hasina was unapologetic and said the law had taken its course. \n\u201cThe courts went against him,\u201d Mrs. Hasina said. \u201cWhy he\u2019s blaming me, I don\u2019t know.\u201d ",

    "text": "Bangladesh Faces Atrocities of Its Independence Era\n2011-03-05T22:08:10.000Z\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 In the last days of the bloody war that created this nation out of the eastern half of Pakistan in 1971, a gang of men abducted Dr. Alim Chowdhury, an eye surgeon and independence activist, from his home. Three days later, his battered body was found in a mass grave, his eyes gouged from his head.\nHis killers, members of a pro-Pakistan militia, were never punished. Moulana Abdul Mannan, the man who confessed to orchestrating the killing, according to a government investigation, went on to become a cabinet minister and member of the Bangladesh Parliament. He died in 2006.\nNow, 40 years after Bangladesh\u2019s independence struggle \u2014 one of the last century\u2019s most wrenching conflicts, whose death toll may have exceeded one million people \u2014 the government here is seeking to prosecute individuals accused of atrocities like the one against Dr. Chowdhury.\nThe effort has touched a raw political nerve here and illustrates a conundrum of international law: Can a country, particularly a young and poor one, fairly try its own citizens for crimes against humanity?\nMany of those accused of atrocities are not only still alive, but are also among the leading members of two of the main opposition political parties and have enjoyed long stints in power.\nSix men have been arrested in connection with various crimes of the era, all of them major political figures. The government hopes to try them in a tribunal of its own creation in the coming months.\nThe Bangladesh tribunal is being closely watched, and its outcome could have wide implications.\nDeveloping countries whose governments have been accused of atrocities, from Sudan to Sri Lanka, have argued that international tribunals are selectively applied to poor nations and represent a new form of imperialism. A successful, fair and transparent trial in Bangladesh could be an important model, international justice experts say.\nBut it will not be easy. Indeed, the whole concept of international justice rests in part on the reality that in the aftermath of a horrendous conflict, national courts are likely to be too politicized to deliver impartial justice.\n\u201cFrom a human rights perspective, you want the national authorities whose job it is to punish these crimes to be able to do it,\u201d said Richard Dicker, an expert in international justice at Human Rights Watch. \u201cBut that exists in tension with the overarching political imperatives.\u201d\nThe quest for justice is particularly problematic in Bangladesh, where politics is a deeply personalized, polarizing business, and almost all of the accused are political enemies of the current government, led by Sheik Hasina Wazed of the Awami League Party.\nGovernment officials argue that the trials are necessary and long overdue.\n\u201cThe victims expect that in a civilized democratic country that there must be justice for them,\u201d said Shafique Ahmed, Bangladesh\u2019s law minister.\nAfter decades of being derided as a basket case, in Henry Kissinger\u2019s infamous assessment, Bangladesh is enjoying a season of stability and relative prosperity. Its current government was elected in a landslide in 2008, bringing back democracy after a spell of military-backed rule. Its economy has sprung to life, growing at about 6 percent last year. Healing the wounds of the independence era is a crucial next step, government officials say.\nBangladesh\u2019s government has pledged to hold fair trials and has sought the help of Western governments and international officials, including Stephen Rapp, the United States ambassador at large for war crimes. Speaking to reporters here in January, Mr. Rapp said that Bangladesh could become a model for how to handle international crimes in a local setting.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that these cases happen at a national level, close to the communities that were affected, close to the victims,\u201d he said, \u201cclose to the families of the people who are accused, who can visit and watch and judge for themselves.\u201d\nSome Latin American countries have held successful trials for war crimes, Mr. Dicker said, but the perils of a local tribunal were evident in the trials of Saddam Hussein and his associates in Iraq. A cellphone video that emerged of Hussein\u2019s hanging, and the pro-Shiite taunts that accompanied it, underscored the appearance of victors\u2019 justice.\nSuch an outcome would only worsen the deep divisions here, opposition politicians argue.\n\u201cWe are now convinced that it would not be possible for this government to deliver justice impartially and fairly,\u201d said Khaleda Zia, the leader of the Bangladesh National Party and Sheik Hasina\u2019s archrival.\nOne senior member of her party is among the accused. The rest are members of Jamaat-e-Islami, a party that supported union with Pakistan during the war of independence and created several militias that were accused of killing tens of thousands of people.\nBangladesh was born in blood, and in many ways the cleavages opened by the war persist to this day. When Britain partitioned India, the mostly Muslim eastern part of Bengal Province was assigned to Pakistan. Other than a shared Islamic faith, the two halves of Pakistan had little in common, and more than 1,000 miles separated them.\nIn 1970, the Awami League, East Pakistan\u2019s biggest political party, won a majority of seats in Pakistan\u2019s Parliament. But leaders in West Pakistan balked at letting a Bengali-led party form a government.\nThe crisis gave way to war in 1971. The military unleashed a brutal assault on the independence movement. The death toll remains unknown, but hundreds of thousands of civilians died, untold numbers of women were raped and millions fled to India.\nBangladesh won its independence in December of that year, and resolved to try those who had helped the Pakistanis. But the troubled new nation soon fell into chaos and autocracy.\nIn 1975, the military overthrew the government, and the prime minister, Sheik Mujibur Rahman, was assassinated with most of his family. Deeply impoverished and repeatedly hit by natural disasters, Bangladesh seesawed between military and civilian rule and was too busy trying to survive to delve into the past.\nAs a result, Bangladesh has never fully reconciled the split between Pakistan loyalists and those who fought for independence. Abdur Razzaq, a senior member of Jamaat-e-Islami and a lawyer, said that it was not a crime to oppose independence.\n\u201cIt is 100 percent correct that they were in favor of Pakistan, that they prayed to God for a united Pakistan,\u201d he said of the members of his party who had been accused of atrocities. \u201cBut it is 100 percent incorrect that these people were involved in war crimes.\u201d\nLike many opposition leaders, he argued that the poisonous political atmosphere in Bangladesh made fair trails impossible, and he said that a process of reconciliation like the one in South Africa at the end of apartheid would be more appropriate for Bangladesh. But victims and their advocates scoff at that notion.\n\u201cA decade after Nelson Mandela\u2019s death, let\u2019s get together and discuss whether South Africans are happy with the justice they got,\u201d said Mizanur Rahman, who lost two uncles in the war and is now chairman of the Bangladesh Human Rights Commission. \u201cUntil and unless you put to rest this long history of impunity it will go on. It pinches your heart every moment of your existence.\u201d\nAnother complicating factor is the death penalty. International courts have always avoided it, and most Western countries do not permit it, which will make it tough to win support for the tribunal from the European Union and others. The war\u2019s victims say it is necessary to execute the guilty to ensure that they are not released by future governments.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know when Khaleda Zia is in power next time, will she let them all out of prison?\u201d Shahriar Kabir, who has fought for the war crimes trials for decades, said, referring to a former prime minister. \u201cAll this time they are crying for the human rights of the perpetrators. What about the rights of the victims?\u201d\nNuzhat Chowdhury, the daughter of Dr. Chowdhury, said that even if her father\u2019s killer is dead, someone should be punished for the crimes of 1971.\n\u201cI saw my father\u2019s killer become a minister in this country,\u201d said Dr. Chowdhury, who like her father is an eye surgeon. \u201cWe were afraid to call ourselves the children of Alim Chowdhury. We need justice to heal.\u201d",

    "text": "Microcredit Pioneer Ousted, Head of Bangladeshi Bank Says\n2011-03-02T11:28:04.000Z\nNEW DELHI \u2014 Muhammad Yunus, the Bangladeshi economist and Nobel Peace Prize winner who pioneered tiny loans for village entrepreneurs as a way to fight poverty, has been forced out of the bank he founded, the government-appointed chairman of the bank said Wednesday.\nBut Grameen Bank disputed that assertion by the chairman, Muzammel Huq, saying in a statement that Mr. Yunus was \u201ccontinuing his office\u201d while it sought legal advice.\nMr. Huq said that Mr. Yunus had been terminated as managing director by the central bank, Bangladesh Bank, because of a technical violation of the law that had created Grameen. His appointment should have been approved by the central bank, Mr. Huq said, but it was not.\n\u201cHe was relieved of his duties for noncompliance,\u201d Mr. Huq said.\nBangladesh Bank sent a letter to Grameen outlining what it said were violations of the law that governed the bank and stating that Mr. Yunus had been relieved of his duties. The bank insisted that the board had not acted on the letter.\nThe letter is the latest skirmish in a protracted battle to diminish the influence of Mr. Yunus, 70, a celebrated figure on the global stage who has come under harsh scrutiny at home.\nGovernment officials have been examining Grameen\u2019s books for months, saying that it lacked proper oversight and governance. But Mr. Yunus\u2019s allies have argued that the government is simply trying to discredit a critic. Mr. Yunus, who was awarded the Nobel in 2006, briefly floated a political party in 2007 and had criticized Bangladesh\u2019s politicians as corrupt.\nA Norwegian documentary alleged that the bank had improperly transferred $100 million donated by the Norwegian government for housing loans to another nonprofit affiliate of Grameen. A government investigation in Norway confirmed that the money had been improperly moved but said that it was returned to its rightful place and that no money had been stolen or misused.\nBangladesh\u2019s prime minister, Sheik Hasina Wazed, seized on the accusations and in December accused microlenders of \u201csucking blood from the poor in the name of poverty alleviation.\u201d\nA senior financial regulator in Bangladesh, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Bangladesh Bank had notified Grameen and the government that they had to seek the central bank\u2019s permission for Mr. Yunus to remain as managing director. But those notifications were routinely ignored by both Grameen and the government, he said.\n\u201cSomeone like him should have been mindful of the legal pitfalls,\u201d the regulator said. \u201cI feel very sorry about it.\u201d\nThe dispute is all but certain to plunge Grameen into a period of turmoil. In an interview in January, Mr. Yunus said that he wanted to step aside but that his presence was necessary to ensure the bank\u2019s stability. His sudden departure could prompt a run on the bank, he said.\nWith its 8.3 million borrowers, almost all of them poor women, and $10 billion in loans, Grameen plays an outsize role in Bangladesh\u2019s economic and political life. Its borrowers own more than 95 percent of the bank, and the government owns the rest. Foreign allies of Mr. Yunus have pressed the Bangladeshi government to stop what many see as harassment of a selfless figure who devoted his life to the poor.\nFellow Nobel laureates, former world leaders and global celebrities have spoken out in support of Mr. Yunus. Mindful of the international attention, a Finance Ministry official said that the government planned to meet on Thursday with representatives of the major foreign embassies and the World Bank in Dhaka to discuss the decision.\n\u201cIf people perceive this as politically motivated, it would be a step back for the country in terms of investment policy,\u201d said Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak, an assistant professor of economics at Yale.\nHe added that it could also empower politicians to attack microfinance more broadly by encouraging borrowers to default on their debts.\nThe move against Mr. Yunus comes as microcredit, the idea he helped popularize, has come under increasing scrutiny. Some economists have argued that its effectiveness as a tool to fight poverty is overstated.\nIn Latin America, lenders have been accused of charging usurious rates, prompting repayment strikes.\nIn India, government regulators in the state of Andhra Pradesh cracked down on the industry after a spate of suicides that they claimed had been caused by strong-arm collection tactics and overindebtedness by microfinance customers.\n\u201cIt is certainly a sign of the bad times for the microfinance sector as a whole,\u201d said Vijay Mahajan, who heads Basix, an Indian lender. \u201cIn country after country, what was considered a very useful and hopeful thing for poor people \u2014 and indeed financially sustainable \u2014 is now being reviled as something that is either exploitative or worse.\u201d\nWhatever happens to Mr. Yunus, his legacy seems secure, his allies say.\n\u201cHis contribution to humanity is huge,\u201d Mr. Mahajan said. \u201cHe single-handedly proved the veracity of one sentence: The poor are creditworthy.\u201d",

    "text": "Perceptions of Migration Clash With Reality, Report Finds\n2011-12-05T23:33:00.000Z\nPARIS \u2014 Perceptions of the impact of migration in some countries are so distorted that their citizens estimate that there are as many as three times the number of immigrants living there than is actually the case, a global migration body says in a report being released on Tuesday.\nIn \u201cWorld Migration Report for 2011,\u201d the International Organization for Migration, a 132-member intergovernmental body based in Geneva, warns that misinformation about migration fans \u201charmful stereotypes, discrimination and xenophobia.\u201d \nWilliam Lacy Swing, director general of the organization, said that accurately informing the public about migration might be \u201cthe single most important policy tool in all societies faced with increasing diversity.\u201d \nThis, he added, is particularly important in times of economic stress, when negative perceptions tend to surface.\n\u201cMigration is often the catch-all issue that masks public fears and uncertainties relating to unemployment, housing and social cohesion in host countries,\u201d Mr. Swing said.\nPeople in destination countries tended to significantly overstate the size of the migrant population, the organization said, based on polling from an annual survey, \u201cTrans-Atlantic Trends.\u201d\nThe actual percentage of migrants in Italy in 2010 was around 7 percent, the report said, \u201cyet polls showed that the population perceived this percentage to be around a staggering 25 percent.\u201d \nSome surveys in the United States showed that the public believed that immigrants made up 39 percent of the population in 2010. That estimate, the report said, was \u201ca far cry\u201d from the actual 14 percent. \u201cEstimates tend to be even higher for irregular migrants,\u201d Mr. Swing said, referring to refugees, people who have entered a country illegally and those who overstayed their visas. \nPerceptions about the availability of employment and a belief that migrants take jobs away from citizens were commonly found in the polls. But the organization said that the news media rarely followed up the issue with employers.\n\u201cWhile there is growing recognition that migrants can build cross-border social capital, that increasing cultural diversity can provide impetus for the stimulation of entrepreneurship, or that culturally diverse work forces are among the most profitable, the overall perception of migrants in many societies tends to be negative,\u201d the report said. \nMr. Swing said migration was \u201chighly desirable\u201d if managed intelligently and humanely, calling it \u201cboth a reality and a necessity.\u201d \nThe report also reviewed migration trends and major policy developments in the 2010-11 period.\nDespite a common perception in the news media that Europe \u201crisked being swamped by a flood of migrants from Africa,\u201d it said that the percentage of Africans migrating abroad remained relatively modest in 2010, when 64 percent of sub-Saharan African migration took place within the region itself. \nIn all, about 30 million Africans, or 3 percent of the population, live abroad, according to the World Bank.\nMeanwhile, foreign workers in Europe suffered higher unemployment in 2010 than their counterparts in the citizenry. While Spaniards suffered 18.1 percent unemployment in 2010, the rate for foreigners in Spain was 30.2 percent, the organization\u2019s data show. In Germany, migrants were nearly twice as likely as locals to be jobless (12.4 percent versus 6.5 percent) during the summer of 2010. Europe, for its part, was the generator of new outflows, with net emigration from Ireland reaching 60,000 people at the end of 2010, after 7,800 in 2009.\nThe United States was host to about 43 million foreigners in 2010, representing 13.5 percent of the total population, according to the World Bank. About 11.6 million came from Mexico, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. The estimated number of irregular migrants in the United States was steady, at 11.2 million in 2010, after a two-year decline from a peak of 12 million in 2007, the report quoted the Pew Hispanic Center as saying.\nFive of the world\u2019s top 10 emigration countries in 2010 were in Asia: Bangladesh, China, India, Pakistan and the Philippines. Most were temporary labor migrants who headed to the Middle East and the Gulf states.\nHigher oil prices helped the Middle East and North Africa recover from the global economic downturn in 2010, with foreign workers attracted to the Gulf region by rising salaries. \nStill, the organization said, \u201cthe humanitarian crisis in Libya and the unsettled conditions in some neighboring countries are likely to have the greatest impact on remittance-receiving countries in South Asia, which have an estimated 11 million expatriate workers living in the region.\u201d\nOceania was host to six million international migrants in 2010. Although accounting for less than 3 percent of the total number of migrants worldwide, this number represented 16.8 percent of the region\u2019s total population, about 35 million. For Australia and New Zealand, the percentages were higher still \u2014 migrants represented 21.9 percent and 22.4 percent, respectively, of their total 2009 population, according to U.N. figures.",

    "text": "Removal of Microfinancing Bank Founder Upheld\n2011-03-08T11:41:00.000Z\nMUMBAI, India \u0097 A court in Bangladesh has upheld the dismissal of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus from the microfinance bank he founded and has run for three decades.\nOn Tuesday, the Bangladesh High Court rejected an appeal by Mr. Yunus challenging the central bank, Bangladesh Bank, which removed him last week as managing director of Grameen Bank. Lawyers said that Mr. Yunus, who shared the peace prize with Grameen Bank in 2006, would appeal to the Bangladesh Supreme Court.\nThe ruling is the most recent development in months of battle over the control of Grameen Bank between the government and Mr. Yunus, an economist celebrated around the world for popularizing microfinance who has fallen out of favor with the leaders of his country.\nIn a letter sent to Grameen\u2019s board last week, Bangladesh Bank said it was removing Mr. Yunus because in 1999, Grameen Bank reappointed him without obtaining permission from the regulator, as required by law. \nA two-judge panel of the High Court agreed with the central bank. In its ruling on Tuesday, it specified that Mr. Yunus\u2019s term in office had expired in 1999, the year before he turned 60. That is normally the mandatory age of retirement for bankers. \nIn a statement issued late Monday, Mr. Yunus questioned Bangladesh Bank\u2019s sudden campaign against him, and noted that it had conducted annual audits of Grameen and that it had not raised the lack of the regulator\u2019s permission before. He also noted that Bangladesh Bank had raised the issue of his age only in 1999.\nHe said that he had been named managing director by the board with the permission of the central bank and that the board, which includes government appointees, had unanimously decided that there should be no age limit for the position.\nMr. Yunus also said that he was willing to step down as managing director but that there must be \u201ca smooth transition of management leadership from me to the next managing director in a congenial environment.\u201d\nThe push to remove Mr. Yunus started late last year after a  documentary accused him and Grameen Bank of improperly transferring to an affiliate $100 million that had been donated to the bank by Norway. The money was re-transferred after Norwegian officials complained about the transaction. In a statement last year, Norway cleared Grameen and Mr. Yunus of wrongdoing.\nAfter the documentary\u2019s accusations came to light, the prime minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, said Mr. Yunus and other microfinance firms were \u201csucking blood from the poor in the name of poverty alleviation.\u201d And the government stepped up its oversight and supervision of the bank, arguing that it was poorly governed.\nMs. Hasina and Mr. Yunus, who has been critical of politicians, were once close, but their relationship soured when Mr. Yunus briefly floated a political party in 2007.\nWith its 8.3 million borrowers, almost all of them poor women, and $10 billion in loans, Grameen plays an outsize role in Bangladesh\u2019s economic and political life. Foreign governments, including the United States, have spoken in support of Mr. Yunus and called on officials to treat him \u201cfairly.\u201d \nEmployees and supporters of Grameen Bank protested the ruling near the bank\u2019s headquarters in the capital, Dhaka, on Tuesday. \nSecretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was scheduled to speak with him later on Tuesday. \nThough almost wholly owned by its customers, Grameen has a special, quasi-public status. The bank was created in 1983 by an act of the government, which initially owned 25 percent of its shares. The government, which now owns less than 4 percent of the bank, also has the right to appoint 3 of the 12 directors on its boards. The others are elected by the customer-owners of the bank.\nThe government-appointed chairman of Grameen\u2019s board, Muzammel Huq, said after the Tuesday ruling that the board would meet soon to pick a new managing director. The meeting could be contentious, given that the nine directors appointed by Grameen\u2019s customers had also appealed Mr. Yunus\u2019s removal.\n\u201cThe majority decision will prevail; everything will be recorded,\u201d said Mr. Huq, a former Grameen official who has been critical of Mr. Yunus. The board has traditionally operated \u201cthrough consensus, and we will try to keep that consensus.\u201d",

    "text": "3 Bangladeshis Die During Evacuation From Libya\n2011-03-06T21:13:06.000Z\nATHENS \u2014 At least three Bangladeshi evacuees from Libya died Sunday after trying to swim from a Greek ferry onto the island of Crete, the authorities there said. It was one of the worst single incidents to stem from the vast outward flow of migrants from Libya, and affected a country, Greece, deeply involved in the evacuations.\nThe deaths came as the ferry was preparing to dock at Souda Bay, transporting about 1,200 evacuees. The local coast guard chief, Antonis Daskalakis, confirmed the deaths and said in a telephone interview that 11 other people were missing.\nUnder cover of darkness, a group of 49 passengers had used a rope to clamber down the side of the Cypriot-flagged Ionian King, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs said in a statement. Ten coast guard vessels and a rescue helicopter were deployed to search for other passengers after someone at a nearby navy base spotted people in the sea and on the beach.\nMr. Daskalakis said that the 49 were all Bangladeshi employees of the Korean conglomerate Daewoo in Libya.\nIt appeared that the Bangladeshis feared being sent to their homeland, meaning an expensive trip back if they were to resume working abroad. \u201cThey clearly didn\u2019t want to return home,\u201d Mr. Daskalakis said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any other reason for such behavior.\u201d\nThose rescued were being treated for symptoms of hypothermia and dehydration.\nThe remaining passengers aboard the Ionian King were mostly Koreans, Filipinos and Sudanese.\nGreece has been active in evacuating foreign nationals from Libya, transporting hundreds of Filipinos and Europeans, and more than 10,000 Chinese workers to Crete for flights home.\nIn Tunisia, where more than 100,000 evacuees have arrived for processing near the border with Libya, the authorities were still puzzling over the sharply lower outflow of refugees, which most attributed to a combination of fear by the migrants and intervention by the Libyan government. One British official called it \u201ca matter of some anxiety.\u201d\n\u201cTwo days ago there were 10,000 or 11,000 people coming across,\u201d said the official, Andrew Mitchell, the international development secretary, who had visited the border area on Friday. \u201cYesterday there were only 1,863 people who came across.\u201d\n\u201cSomething has happened,\u201d Mr. Mitchell told Reuters.\nAid agencies remained barred from areas of Libya under government control, and Mr. Mitchell called on the authorities in Tripoli \u201cimmediately to reopen unfettered international humanitarian access.\u201d\nWhile some foreign governments, including those of India and China, have mounted relatively efficient evacuation operations for their nationals, workers from poorer countries, like Bangladesh and Egypt, have often had to find their own way home.\nBut the British government said Sunday that it would provide emergency flights to repatriate 500 stranded Bangladeshis, on charter planes from Djerba airport in Tunisia. British planes have already repatriated more than 6,000 Egyptians.\nAt the Ras Jdir transit camp in Tunisia, officials said Sunday that they were seeking satellite imagery of Libya to explain the sudden drop in the flow of migrants.\nIn all, a little more than half of the workers who have fled Libya have crossed into Tunisia. About 45,000 Egyptians took that westward route amid difficulties in traveling to the east. Ten flights from the airport on the small Tunisian island of Djerba were due Sunday, and the authorities said they would take most of the remaining Egyptians to Cairo.\nFollowing an order last week from President Barack Obama, U.S. military aircraft have joined those of some European countries in staging the airlift. A U.S. Air Force C-130 cargo plane from Ramstein Air Base in Germany joined a Marine Corps KC-130 aircraft on Sunday, with other planes to follow.\nRas Jdir camp is capable of accommodating up to 20,000 migrants for short periods. Despite a steady arrival of food and water, mainly from Tunisian charity and aid organizations, the camp is strewn with litter from the constant arrivals and departures, and tempers on Sunday were beginning to fray.\nBut for 400 Egyptian laborers, who had been robbed by Libyan soldiers and then spent days huddling at the Tunisian transit camp, the weekend brought a strange but welcome conclusion \u2014 a ride home in three German warships.\nThe workers had lined up Saturday along a dock in the Tunisian port of Gabes, a three-hour bus ride from the transit camp, for the trip to Alexandria, The Associated Press reported.\nThe German Navy had set up an airport-style check-in.\nThe refugees registered their passports, were assigned numbers and matching luggage tags, opened their bags for inspection, had their temperature taken by a doctor and then climbed up the gangway.\nThe vessels brought along an Arabic translator, leaflets in Arabic explaining the rules on a warship and traditional Arabic food for the three-day journey.\nThe Egyptians will sleep in huge hangars in the belly of the frigates where helicopters normally are stowed. Each hangar has a large television offering Egyptian fare.\n\u201cI am very pleased with them,\u201d said one traveler, Abdel Hamid Mutajalli, 23, of his hosts.\n\u201cThey have a good system,\u201d said Mr. Mutajalli, who had worked as a house painter in the city of Tarablus. \u201cThere is no chaos here.\u201d",

    "text": "Poisoning the Well\n2011-02-04T17:04:32.000Z\nI \u2007haven\u2019t had the talk yet with my kids: my 11-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter. I mean the one about global warming, about what\u2019s coming. But then, we grown-ups haven\u2019t had the talk yet among ourselves. Not really. We don\u2019t seem to know how: the topic is apparently too big and scary. Or perhaps, for the uninformed (or misinformed), not scary enough. \nWe might take a cue from Mark Hertsgaard\u2019s \u201cHot,\u201d which raises the emotional stakes while keeping a clear head. This was the first book on climate change that not only frightened me \u2014 plenty have done that \u2014 but also broke my heart. It happened first on the dedication page, where he writes, \u201cFor my daughter, Chiara, who has to live through this.\u201d And again, as I read his epilogue: a letter addressed to Chiara on her 15th birthday, in 2020 \u2014 a \u201ccardinal date,\u201d Hertsgaard rightly calls it. \u201cAccording to the scientists I interviewed,\u201d he tells her, \u201cmany, many things have to happen by 2020 if this planet is to remain a livable place.\u201d That is, if the storms, droughts, rising sea levels and mass extinctions of species are to remain within \u201cmanageable\u201d limits.\nHertsgaard, to his credit, refuses to sugarcoat these facts. For all the justifiable fears about flooded coastlines, he writes, the \u201coverriding danger\u201d in the coming years is drought. \u201cFloods kill thousands, drought can kill millions,\u201d one expert told him. Within two decades, the number of people in \u201cwater-stressed countries\u201d will rise to three billion from 800 million. \nAnd yet Hertsgaard also knows that we cannot allow fear or despair, or even anger, to be our only response. To face this challenge, we need reasons to believe the task is doable. Hertsgaard makes a valiant effort to provide them. He presents a strong case that there is still time to make an enormous difference. We know what to do, and much of the technology already exists. But we must act now.\nHertsgaard, a veteran journalist, had his awakening in October 2005. Interviewing David King, at the time Britain\u2019s chief climate scientist, he realized that human-caused climate change is not a distant threat but already upon us. \u201cScientists had actually underestimated the danger,\u201d he writes. \u201cClimate change had arrived a century sooner than expected.\u201d What\u2019s more, given our current trajectory \u2014 economic, cultural and, most important, political \u2014 it\u2019s guaranteed to get a lot worse before it gets any better. (Significant impacts like sea-level rise are now \u201clocked in.\u201d) And it won\u2019t get any better \u2014 indeed, it will become truly unmanageable \u2014 if we don\u2019t make the necessary cuts in global greenhouse emissions.\nThis leads Hertsgaard to what he calls the new \u201cdouble imperative\u201d of the climate fight. \u201cWe have to live through global warming,\u201d he writes, \u201ceven as we halt and reverse it.\u201d In other words, while deep emissions cuts (what experts call \u201cmitigation\u201d) remain the top priority, that alone is no longer enough. We also have to do everything we can to prepare for the effects of climate change. \nAdaptation \u2014 strengthening levees and sea defenses, safeguarding water and food supplies, preparing for more intense heat waves \u2014 has long been a touchy subject among advocates, who warn that it signals resignation, or a false sense of security (that we can continue adapting indefinitely), and that it steals resources from the all-important focus on mitigation. But the debate is shifting, and climate adaptation is starting to get the attention it deserves. \nThere\u2019s not much new in what Hertsgaard advocates on the mitigation front \u2014 a \u201cGreen Apollo\u201d program with an economy-wide price on carbon, vastly increased energy efficiency, huge investments in clean-energy technology, and other mainstream ideas. His significant contribution is his ground-level reporting on adaptation efforts around the world, from American cities to Bangladesh to the Sahel. All the stories are sobering, but many are also surprisingly hopeful: the Netherlands\u2019 bold 200-year plan to save the country from a devastating sea-level rise; the utterly unexpected success of farmers in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso in reclaiming huge areas of arable land from desertification; China\u2019s research on large-scale ecological agriculture.\nBut most important, what Hertsgaard finds is that the ability to adapt to climate change depends as much on \u201csocial context\u201d \u2014 defined as \u201cthe mix of public attitudes, cultural habits, political tendencies, economic interests and civic procedures\u201d \u2014 as on wealth and technological sophistication. Wealth and technology clearly matter, but politics and culture may trump them. Take Louisiana: efforts to prepare for future hurricanes, Hertsgaard writes, \u201chave been crippled by the state\u2019s history of poor government\u201d along with \u201cits continuing reluctance \u2014 even after Katrina \u2014 to acknowledge the reality of global warming for fear that might harm oil and gas production, and an abhorrence of taxes and public planning as somehow socialistic.\u201d \nIn fact, Hertsgaard\u2019s reporting makes me wonder if there isn\u2019t more hope for the Sahel than for the vulnerable South and Southwest of the United States. After all, why prepare for something \u2014 much less try to halt it \u2014 if you refuse to believe it\u2019s happening? \nThe American social context too often remains the largest obstacle, Hertsgaard observes, not only to adaptation at home but to cutting emissions globally. It\u2019s not clear how to change this, but an honest, urgent, grown-up national conversation \u2014 beginning in Washington \u2014 would be a start. ",

    "text": "Venice Biennale Thrives Despite Tough Economic Times\n2011-06-06T12:30:24.000Z\nVENICE \u2014 While the arts may be struggling in many parts of the world in the face of reduced resources, the Venice Biennale seems immune to the economic downturn.\nAt the 54th edition, scheduled to continue through Nov. 27, there are a record number of national pavilions \u2014 89 in all, including new participants from nations rich and poor, including Saudi Arabia, Andorra, Bangladesh and Haiti \u2014 nearly a third more than the total in 1999. There are 37 official collateral shows and dozens of parallel events. There also seem to be a record number of outsized yachts lining Venice quays and moored off the Customs Point, and end-to-end parties and receptions during the press and private view days.\nThe curator of this year\u2019s Biennale show \u201cILLUMInations,\u201d at the Central Pavilion in the Castello Gardens and at the Corderie (Rope Walk) in the Arsenale, is the Swiss art historian and critic Bice Curiger. She has chosen 83 artists for her spaces, a third of whom are under the age of 35, although she has by no means overlooked older artists, including Luigi Ghirri and Jack Goldstein, who are no longer alive.\nThe oldest artist on display is Jacopo Tintoretto (1518-1594). Ms. Curiger has borrowed three large canvases by the Venetian painter, whom she sees as \u201ca painter of light\u201d and a bit of rebel in his times, as relevant to her theme.\nHanging in the Central Pavilion in the Gardens, they share a cavernous room with several dozen verminous-looking stuffed pigeons that were provided by the Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan and have been glued to the air-conditioning pipes overhead.\nOne of the Tintoretto\u2019s works, \u201cThe Last Supper,\u201d has been temporarily removed from the island church of San Giorgio Maggiore. This painting is closely related to the church\u2019s architecture, designed by Andrea Palladio, and is a \u201csite-specific installation\u201d in today\u2019s art lingo, making its translation to the Gardens seems somewhat perverse. (The other two Tintorettto canvases normally hang at the Accademia, which is undergoing restoration.)\nMeanwhile, Anish Kapoor has visited upon the San Giorgio church his own \u201csite-specific installation\u201d called \u201cAscension.\u201d This consists of a tenuous shaft of vapor rising from the floor of the basilica into the dome.\nThe massive stainless steel tubing that runs up the side of the building and then half fills the interior of the dome is frankly hideous to behold and does violence to this timelessly magnificent building.\nAmong the photographers Ms. Curiger has chosen for her show, Luigi Ghirri and David Goldblatt are particularly striking. Ghirri, who died in 1992, had an exquisite sense of light and composition and his studies of everyday scenes in provincial Italy are miniature masterpieces.\nThe veteran David Goldblatt, now in his eighties, is represented by two sequences of photographs of Johannesburg, which he has been chronicling for decades: one of housing seen from the air and the other of \u201cex-offenders,\u201d criminals he has brought back to the scenes of their often violent crimes to take their portraits. But it is difficult to appreciate fully these absorbing images because of the head-bangingly loud electronic noises emitted by the London-born Haroon Mirza\u2019s installation, insensitively placed next to them. Called \u201cSick,\u201d this installation contributed to Mirza\u2019s Silver Lion for a promising young artist.\nAmong the most memorable pieces at the Corderie in Ms. Curiger\u2019s Arsenale show \u2014 and they will be just memories by the end of it \u2014 are Urs Fischer\u2019s life-sized wax statues. For this occasion he has created a full-scale copy of the 16th-century sculptor Giambologna\u2019s \u201cRape of the Sabine Women,\u201d placing before it a portrait statue of his friend the artist Rudolf Stingel. They have wicks in strategic places and will gradually burn down in the coming weeks.\nThe last work in the Corderie was an inspired choice: \u201cThe Clock\u201d (2010) by the Swiss-American Christian Marclay, which won him the Golden Lion for best artist. Composed of clips from 2,000 to 3,000 films (by the artist\u2019s own estimate) linked by his amazingly adept editing and a skillful musical score, it is a 24-hour experience. All the sequences have verbal, visual or aural references to the time, with shots of watches and clocks, and chiming bells for instance, corresponding exactly to the viewer\u2019s real time. Hugely enjoyable, \u201cThe Clock\u201d also provokes thought about time in our own lives and about the suspension of time that we seek in cinema.\nThe installation at the British Pavilion by Mike Nelson is a reprise of the recreation of a squalid interior of workshops in a neglected old Istanbul caravanserai, first done for the Istanbul Biennale in 2003. The cost of this latest stunt, which involved removing part of the roof of the historic pavilion, must have accounted for the best part of the British Council\u2019s Venice budget of \u00a3300,000, or about $490,000, at a time when many arts organizations in Britain have lost public funding. For safety reasons, only a very small number of visitors are allowed into this cramped and dusty warren at any one time.\nThe Venezuela pavilion was enlivened by actual performances by Clemencia Labin and two films about her exuberantly colorful, creative and inclusive arts festival, founded in 2000. A huge success, it has since been held annually in the poor central neighborhood of Santa Luc\u00eda in her home city of Maracaibo, with 44 of the local houses opening their doors as temporary galleries, and dozens of young artists and the community at large taking part.\nWith future global conflicts as likely to revolve around water as oil and gas, several works took the subject as a theme.\nSigalit Landau\u2019s multifaceted show at the Israel pavilion includes an installation of water pipes, pumps and meters, and an intriguing project for a symbolic bridge built of salt, linking the Israeli and Jordanian sides of the ecologically and politically threatened Dead Sea.\nWatery images play a key role in the artist Tabaimo\u2019s latest work at the Japan pavilion. She brings together the worlds of old woodblock prints and contemporary Japanese society in lyrical animations composed of thousands of hand-drawn images scanned into her computer and used to construct mysterious, vibrant narratives.\nLee Yongbaek\u2019s exhibition at the Korea pavilion packs several surprises.\nHis larger-than-life sculptures, like \u201cPiet\u00e0: Self-death,\u201d use both the mold itself and the figure made from it to create two related figures. And his \u201cBroken Mirror\u201d installation, employing a high-speed camera and complex electronics, presents a series of looking glasses shattered by flying bullets at regular intervals and miraculously recomposing themselves over and over again.\nThe artist Diohandi has boxed up the neo-Byzantine Greek Pavilion like a giant packing case, as if the entire building were ready for shipment to some foreign shore to help pay off the country\u2019s crippling debts. The water-flooded interior has been reduced to an austere d\u00e9cor of black and white, lit by a single floor-to-ceiling strip of sunlight \u2014 an eery refuge from the turbulence of the times.\nThe Hellenic Institute, by the San Giorgio dei Greci church, in \u201cIlluminated Shadows\u201d is hosting two artists through July 15 from the Sotiris Felios Collection: Christos Bokoros and Chronis Botsoglou. Both painters make remarkable use of light, and visitors will find this atmospheric exhibition as illuminating as anything currently in Venice.",

    "text": "Love and Real Estate in South Asia\n2011-06-24T16:26:19.000Z\nAnuradha Roy\u2019s first novel opens with the image of a house, \u201ca Roman-\u00adlooking affair with tapering pillars\u201d that seems to float down a river in flood. First its veranda goes under and then its windows, until the rooms look drowned and the building itself appears to leave its moorings. The imagination of disaster is never far from these pages, and though this house will finally stay on its foundation, it does get swamped by a monsoon-swelled river, and with consequences that are bitter indeed. That waterfront property is only one of the three houses in which Roy\u2019s narrative is played out \u2014 each of them bedraggled, each living on after its time, and none of them a proper home.\nIn the early years of the 20th century, the Calcutta-born Amul\u00adya Babu moves his family to a small town called Songarh, where he builds a house not far from the forest and starts a business manufacturing herbal medicines and perfumes. He loves the isolation and the chance for a flower-filled garden, but his wife doesn\u2019t, and eventually she begins to spout a series of sweet-tempered obscenities, words nobody can quite believe she knows. In one of her many delicate touches, Roy never gives this problem a name. Amul\u00adya\u2019s wife doesn\u2019t suffer from Tourette\u2019s syndrome, but rather from something none of the characters understand. Eventually Amulya feels he has to lock her in her room; she is a hidden though not forgotten wife, mother and, in time, grandmother.\nThen people begin to die. An Englishman is murdered across the road, a daughter-\u00adin-law goes in childbirth and Amulya himself is felled. So we move on to the next generation, when the house fills with what isn\u2019t quite a family. Amulya\u2019s oldest son still lives there, but he and his wife are childless and ever jealous of their motherless niece, Bakul, a girl whose own father can hardly bear to look at her, so powerfully does she recall his dead wife. And there is also Mukunda, a boy the family has taken in, a bright child plucked from an orphanage. He and Bakul share everything, but the rest of the household isn\u2019t certain about him. They don\u2019t know his parentage and hence his caste, and make him eat from a special plate lest he pollute their food.\nRoy has a keen sense of the statements people make with their houses. For Amulya, his home in Songarh stands as both a declaration of independence and an attempt to establish a family. For his widowed son\u2019s father-in-law, Bikash, the house on the river with which the novel begins is above all a mark of taste. Yet to those who come later such buildings seem, above all, a burden: offering shelter, but also a reminder of what hasn\u2019t worked out.\nIt\u2019s hard to miss the symbolic weight in this, and of course houses have played such parts in novels before. In English fiction, they often give their names to the book itself \u2014 \u201cMansfield Park\u201d \u2014 and imply an ideal social order. In the American South, they may suggest the ghosts of the past, and in Ireland the \u201cbig house\u201d tells of a sundered and unworkable relationship between different populations. The house has filled all those roles and more in Indian fiction in English, from the old family mansion of Anita Desai\u2019s \u201cClear Light of Day\u201d to the apartment building in Manil Suri\u2019s \u201cDeath of Vishnu.\u201d It is family and nation, order and chaos, and its thematic importance remains impossible to overstate.\nThe refreshing thing about \u201cAn Atlas of Impossible Longing\u201d is that Roy never forgets that a house is also a bit of real estate \u2014 which becomes clear toward the end of the book. She begins her narrative in the third person but concludes it in the first-person voice of the orphan Mukunda. Banished to a Calcutta boarding school when he and Bakul hit puberty, he finds himself living in the city in the mid-1940s, in the rambling house of a Muslim schoolteacher. As independence and partition approach, the teacher asks Mukunda to take care of the place while he himself moves to the safety of what will become East Pakistan and later Bangladesh. At first, Mukun\u00adda proves a good steward, but then he goes to work for an unscrupulous property developer who specializes in such abandoned households. At this point, Mukunda\u2019s temptations and the novel\u2019s coincidences begin to multiply.\nNo reader will be surprised when the young man\u2019s job brings him first to that riverfront house and then to Songarh and the ad hoc family he thought he had lost. The complications will prove disastrous \u2014 and maybe wonderful too, which is precisely the problem with this otherwise likable book. Mukunda narrates these pages as if from long afterward, and the opening paragraphs make it clear that he\u2019s a successful and satisfied man, telegraphing the happy finish that awaits. But that conclusion seems a bit of wish fulfillment that goes against the logic of both Roy\u2019s plot and the society in which her people move. She defines her characters quickly and skillfully, she has a keen eye for landscape, and she knows how private lives can suggest the larger shape of the public world. But her ending borders on the trite. Some longings really do remain impossible, and on its best pages, though not its final ones, this book knows it.",

    "text": "Rescued by Design\n2011-10-21T17:24:26.000Z\nI\u2002JOINED the line to get into the United Nations the other day, fiddling with my iPhone before shuffling through security. The couple in back (he was toting an iPad) mused about what a design guru Steve Jobs had been. They headed toward the information desk and I toward \u201cDesign With the Other 90 Percent: Cities,\u201d an infelicitously titled but inspired show organized by the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum and now installed (since the museum is closed for renovations) in the United Nations visitors\u2019 lobby. \nDesign shows may conjure up fizzy displays of Van Cleef & Arpels or stylish tributes to Helvetica and classic automobiles. Design implies for most people the beautiful things an affluent society makes for itself.\nThis show is not about that kind of design. The objects here tend to look rugged and sometimes embarrassingly simple, as in \u201cWhy hadn\u2019t anyone come up with that idea before?\u201d Their beauty lies elsewhere: in providing economical, smart solutions to address the problems of millions of the world\u2019s poorest people. \nIf the genius of Mr. Jobs was giving us sleek and effortless products that answered questions consumers hadn\u2019t thought to ask yet (can my mobile phone feature a speech-recognition system that reminds me to pick up my dry cleaning?), the designs in this case wrestle with what have long seemed intractable crises. I left stirred by how designers have tackled global pandemics like the proliferation of slums and the spread of infectious disease. \nThis is a design show about remaking the world, in other words. And that\u2019s thrilling, whether it\u2019s happening in Cupertino, Calif., or Uganda, where H.I.V. infects hundreds of people a day, and the latest news cellphone-wise has been the design and distribution of a text-messaging system that spreads health care information. \nText to Change, as the project is called, entails a collaboration by a pair of Dutch communication and technology specialists with local phone service providers and health care organizations. In Kibera, an area of Nairobi, Kenya, and one of the densest slums in Africa, the challenge was different. Traditional wood and charcoal fires cause rampant respiratory disease there. Refuse fills the streets. So a Nairobian architect designed a community cooker, fueled by refuse residents collect in return for time using the ovens.\nFrom cellphones and cookers to cities: in Thailand, a public program called Baan Mankong Community Upgrading has, for the last eight years, been improving conditions in hundreds of that country\u2019s 5,500 slums, bringing residents together with government and nongovernment agencies to design safer, cleaner places to live. \nAlong the Bang Bua Canal in Bangkok, where thousands of families have long squatted in rickety stilt houses linked by flimsy walkways, all teetering above polluted floodwater, architects from nearby Sripatum University were enlisted to devise row houses, detached houses and semidetached houses, along the lines of what residents said they wanted. Hundreds of decrepit stilt structures were demolished, new homes built in their stead, often from recycled doors and timber, on solid ground and near the former stilt houses, so that communities would not be broken up and families uprooted. \nMore than just upgrading housing and infrastructure, the strategy in Bang Bua included low-interest loans and renewable 30-year leases for slum residents, making them, for the first time, legal stakeholders in their properties. This helped to end the old cycle of evictions (in many slums around the world evictions are used to clear space for shopping malls and expressways) that left the poor in Bangkok perennially helpless and hopeless. With money from the loans, the residents of Bang Bua also decided to build a center for the elderly and disabled, and to set aside a fund for libraries, child care and school fees for the poorest families.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to build a house, much harder to build a community,\u201d as Cynthia E. Smith, the show\u2019s curator, told me. \u201cCities are very complex, and what the best designers illustrate is how to give form to sometimes very simple ideas. Good design involves bringing not just a fresh eye to problems but, most of all, listening to the people who live in those communities. We\u2019re talking about a billion people living in informal settlements today,\u201d she added. \u201cYou can see them as a billion problems or a billion solutions.\u201d \nThis show follows a smaller one Ms. Smith organized in 2007 at the Cooper-Hewitt. That exhibition included among its 34 objects a filtered drinking straw that prevents the spread of typhoid and cholera; a bamboo treadle pump that helps poor farmers in Cambodia and India extract groundwater during the dry seasons; and the Q Drum, a doughnut-shaped plastic container, easily rolled, even long distances by children, which is used to transport up to 13 gallons of water. \nThe 2007 exhibition set the stage for this larger undertaking about whole cities, which couldn\u2019t be timelier. We live in an era of unprecedented urban migration. Ms. Smith mentioned the billion people living in informal settlements, or slums. That number is projected to double by 2030, triple by 2050, according to the United Nations Human Settlements Program. By then one of three people on the planet will supposedly be living in favelas in Brazil, barrios in Ecuador, shack settlements in South Africa, bidonvilles in Tunisia or chapros in Nepal \u2014 the names are nearly as endless as the number of these sprawling, unplanned, impoverished places. \nMs. Smith spent a couple of years seeing what designers have been doing to improve living conditions in them. As at Bang Bua, one lesson seems strikingly obvious: the need to solicit the people living in poverty to come up with their own solutions. In so many slums \u2014 Dharavi in Mumbai, India; Corail in Bangladesh; Cape Town, South Africa; and in American cities too \u2014 the poor are left out of the process. But urban-renewal projects always work best when they\u2019re ground up, not top down. \n\u201cThe poor,\u201d Somsook Boonyabancha, founding director of the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights, puts it in the show\u2019s catalog, \u201care the creators and implementers of the most comprehensive and far-reaching systems for solving problems of poverty, housing and basic services.\u201d \nSo in Diadema, a huge industrial city outside S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, 30 percent of the population used to live in favelas during the 1980s, when the homicide rate was shooting into the stratosphere. The government turned to residents for advice, asking them to help set priorities for the city budget, suggest upgrades for neighborhoods and approve construction projects, which employed workers who lived in the communities.\nA land-tenure program awarded residents the right to stay on their property for 90 years, encouraging them to maintain their homes and invest in the neighborhoods. Residents helped to widen and pave streets, install clean-water and sanitation systems. Today, according to Ms. Smith, three percent of Diadema\u2019s residents live in favelas, and the annual homicide rate, a standard measure of civic order and public health, has dropped to 14.3 per 100,000 from its high of 140 during the 1990s.\nMs. Smith also includes in the exhibition the by-now textbook case of Medell\u00edn, Colombia, once the world capital of drug cartels, murder and despair. Progressive political leaders there, starting roughly a decade ago, decided somewhat counterintuitively to invest most heavily in the worst slums, building a cable car system to link the city\u2019s center with the isolated, crime-ridden areas that blanketed the surrounding hills. New libraries and parks, public schools and pedestrian walkways were built around the pylons of the transport system so that the most beautiful and ambitious public architecture in the city went into the poorest neighborhoods. Medell\u00edn became a changed place. \nIn Dakar, Senegal, designers working with community organizers developed an irrigation system to recycle wastewater in the crowded slum of Yoff. And in La Vega, one of the settlements lining the steep slopes around Caracas, Venezuela, a team of architects, engineers working with a geologist, again taking cues from residents, devised a series of new stairs and plazas, so impassable climbs became manageable, neighborhoods were linked and nobody was forced to move out of their homes.\nI was struck by a map in the show that located 238 schools in Kibera, that dense settlement in Nairobi, which occupies a territory smaller than Central Park. I recall discovering a similarly astonishing number of schools and universities on trips to Gaza. Ms. Smith points out the case of Pune, one of India\u2019s many booming cities, where laborers constantly move from one informal settlement to another, following construction projects and taking their families with them. As a consequence their children often aren\u2019t enrolled in school. \nIn response a team of designers decided a decade ago to bring the schools to them, via buses equipped with classrooms for 25 that pick the students up where they live. Students receive old-fashioned handbooks that keep track of academic progress and list phone numbers for education centers around Pune (a second bus network is under way in Mumbai) so that when the children move, their parents can find schools in the new neighborhoods and teachers can pick up where the students left off.\nSimplicity itself. \nOne last example, from Bangladesh: Mohammed Rezwan, a local architect, has designed \u201ccommunity lifeboats\u201d that serve as floating schools, libraries and health clinics. With sea levels rising, nearly 20 percent of the land there is predicted to be under water by 2050. The low-lying Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta, the most densely populated area in the world, will flood. Working with native boat builders Mr. Rezwan adapted the traditional flat-bottom bamboo riverboat to create his Noah\u2019s Arks. He outfitted the boats with waterproof roofs and solar panels, installed computers, high-speed Internet and portable solar lamps made from recycled kerosene lanterns. Traditional materials, local building techniques and renewable energy sources produced a model of contextual design. \nI\u2019m hoping to check out this fleet and also a few of the cities the show celebrates, to see how they\u2019re doing, firsthand. Meanwhile I gather there are now 54 of Mr. Rezwan\u2019s boats in operation in Bangladesh, serving 90,000 families. \nThat\u2019s design guru stuff too. ",

    "text": "Chief of 2012 Olympic Games Undaunted\n2011-08-30T12:09:14.000Z\nDAEGU, SOUTH KOREA \u2014 Looting and mayhem were taking place in his soon-to-be Olympic city earlier this month, and Sebastian Coe had plenty of visitors: athletes who were in London to take part in test events and more than 200 Olympic team leaders who were there to survey the landscape before the 2012 Games.\n\u201cPeople rang me up and said, \u2018You must be really sorry that they\u2019re there,\u201d\u2019 said Coe, the chairman of the organizing committee. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Actually, no. I\u2019m rather pleased they are here, because 24-hour television tends to show the same building burning 10 times every 20 minutes.\u201d\u2019 \nThe point being that the London on the world\u2019s television and computer screens during the riots was not the same London that Coe was seeing and certainly not the London he expects to see from July 27 to Aug. 12 next year.\n\u201cThis was not the London I recognized,\u201d Coe said. \u201cIt was not the London I was born in, not the London I was brought up in. It\u2019s not the London I live in. I actually genuinely believe that was quite an aberration.\u201d\nCoe, in Daegu for the world championships in his role as vice president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, took a bite of his sandwich and then took his personal view further.\n\u201cI\u2019m not convinced in any way that was a political demonstration or this was a manifestation of distracted or disaffected urban youth,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople sitting on pavements trying on different sized Nike trainers and being photographed in front of plasma television sets, it doesn\u2019t immediately strike me that this was the Martin Luther King movement. This was some fairly unstructured late-night shopping.\u201d\nIf this strikes you as unusually provocative stuff from an Olympic organizer, you would be correct, but then Coe \u2014 once the world\u2019s greatest middle distance runner and still a youthful-looking 54-year-old \u2014 is on something of a roll at the moment, and not just because earlier this summer he managed to get married to the magazine editor Carole Annett without making headlines. It was the second marriage for Coe, who has four children from his previous marriage.\n\u201cWe did it completely under the radar screen, which was lovely,\u201d Coe said. \u201cJust a small gathering. No media. In fact, nobody had even figured it out for at least a week, which I think was quite an achievement.\u201d \nBut the newlywed Lord Coe, a former Conservative member of parliament, is now in for another very public year, and even in the wake of the riots of this month, there have been surprisingly few concerns about the buildup to London, which will stage the Games for the first time since 1948.\nEmma John, of the British newspaper The Observer, made her metaphorically rich view clear: \u201cThe London organizing committee appears to be masterminding an unnervingly vast operation with the invisible, eerie efficiency of the Sith lords in \u2018Star Wars.\u2019 By next summer I will be surprised if we don\u2019t see Darth Coe patrolling the Olympic Park with a light saber.\u201d\nThat said, there has been the usual preparation fatigue and grumbling about end-game costs from local residents. There has been an unusual amount of frustration with the ticket allocation system in Britain in the face of heavy demand, along with the ongoing concern about the future of the Olympic stadium and its track.\nStill, the big picture has looked much more sunlit than stormy, which is no minor coup considering the rambunctious British news media and the country\u2019s economic travails lately. Those were not part of the landscape when Coe delivered his stirring, generation-bridging speech in 2005 to the International Olympic Committee in Singapore that was critical to catching Paris at the tape and securing the Games.\nCoe said this was probably the worst economic climate in which to deliver an Olympics since the time leading up the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, which were plagued by massive deficits and cost overruns, problems that Coe said would not apply to London even as East London \u2014 in modern Olympic fashion \u2014 has become a vast urban renewal project.\nBut legacy is hardly the sole focus. A two-time gold medalist in the 1,500, Coe thinks he knows what an athlete deserves. \u201cI say to my teams every day of the week, \u2018You have to remember that when you see a competitor walking out into any of your venues, they probably have dedicated over half their young lives to that moment,\u201d\u2019 he said. \u201c\u2018You will not want to look at yourself and think that they were in any way a victim of your shortcomings.\u201d\u2019\nWhat is surprising about Coe is that for a former politician who is still in a very political job and for someone whose sport has been greatly discredited by doping scandals, he seems genuinely unjaded about the power of the Olympics and of sports in general.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been good to me,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cAnd in most communities, if I\u2019m being really honest \u2014 and this will probably upset a few people \u2014 but in most communities, it\u2019s the real social worker. It\u2019s hands-on.\u201d\nThe London Games have emphasized outreach, including a program designed to bring physical education programs to 12 million youngsters in 20 countries by 2012. \nCoe sounds nearly as enthused about this as he does about sitting next to one of his literary heroes \u2014 the American historian Doris Kearns Goodwin \u2014 at a recent dinner.\n\u201cWe have programs as widely ranged as Azerbaijan and Zambia, and they are not complicated programs,\u201d he said. \n\u201cSo many of these things are over-engineered, and people go into a country and start saying, \u2018Right, this is what we\u2019re going to do.\u2019 Our best example is Bangladesh: 17,000 kids a year drown in Bangladesh when the floods arrive because they can\u2019t swim. What do we do? It\u2019s really simple. We\u2019re teaching people to swim by putting coaches there.\u201d\nIt is apparently easier to effect meaningful change abroad than to get the British to leave their screens and get off their couches: an Olympic-linked program to get one million more Brits into regular physical activity has met with resistance.\nBut Coe said his four children \u2014 ages 12 to 19 \u2014 are active in everything from field hockey to rugby to horseback riding. And even if the Olympics are a big hit in a country that could use some reassurance about now, Coe said his next goal would not be to plunge back into British politics, even with his Tory party currently in power.\n\u201cI will not do it; I don\u2019t want to do it; I\u2019ve done it,\u201d he said. \u201cMy goal is a renaissance of athletics. I want to go off and write seriously. I want to go and do a number of things, want to spend more time with my kids.\u201d \nOne of his role models remains Jean-Claude Killy, the debonair French skier of the 1960s who later brought the 1992 Winter Olympics to Albertville, France. \nProminent sportsmen who became effective administrators are hardly legion. Coe believes too many start too late and refuse to climb back down the ladder and apply the same work ethic that helped them win medals. But though there is much speculation that Coe will take a leadership role in the I.O.C., he is not even an I.O.C. member at the moment. Nor is he a lock to become president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, with Sergei Bubka, the former Ukrainian pole vaulter, positioning himself for the same post.\nBut Coe, with all he has done and learned since Singapore in 2005, could certainly have a compelling case to make. Then might come the harder part.\nReturning track and field to its salad days in this soccer-centric era sounds like more of a challenge than a transcendent, on-budget Olympics.",

    "text": "Another Try for a Global Climate Effort\n2011-11-27T13:21:02.000Z\nWASHINGTON \u2014 With intensifying climate disasters and global economic turmoil as the backdrop, delegates from 194 nations gather in Durban, South Africa, this week to try to advance, if only incrementally, the world\u2019s response to dangerous climate change.\nTo those who have followed the negotiations of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change over their nearly 20-year history, the conflicts and controversies to be taken up in Durban are monotonously familiar \u2014 the differing obligations of industrialized and developing nations, the question of who will pay to help poor nations adapt, the urgency of protecting tropical forests, the need to develop and deploy clean energy technology rapidly.\nThe negotiating process itself is under fire from some quarters, including the poorest nations, who believe their needs are neglected in the fight among the major economic powers. Criticism is also coming from a relatively small but vocal band of climate change skeptics \u2014 many of them sitting members of the U.S. Congress \u2014 who doubt human influence on the climate and ridicule international efforts to address it.\nBut scientists warn that this squabbling serves only to delay actions that must be taken to reduce climate-altering emissions and to fortify vulnerable nations\u2019 ability to respond to the changes they say are surely coming \u2014 indeed, that many say are already here.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or I.P.C.C., is the global body of scientists and statisticians that provides the technical underpinning of the U.N. talks. The Durban meeting is the 17th Conference of the Parties to the U.N. convention on climate change, or COP 17. \nA few weeks ago, the panel released a detailed assessment of the increasing frequency of extreme climate events like droughts, floods and cyclones, noting the necessity of moving quickly to take steps to reduce emissions and adapt to the inevitable damage.\n\u201cAll of these indicate that inaction in dealing with climate change and delays would only expose human society and all living species to risk that could become serious,\u201d Rajendra K. Pachauri, the director of the I.P.C.C., wrote by e-mail from the headquarters of his institute in New Delhi. \u201cI am afraid deliberations at the COP would only focus on short-term political considerations.\u201d\nThe stakes are beyond monumental, critics point out, but the delegates in Durban will be addressing relatively small and, to many people, arcane, questions of process and finance.\nMany negotiators, having entered the U.N. climate talks at Copenhagen two years ago with grand ambitions, left disillusioned and are now defining expectations downward and hoping to keep the U.N. process alive through modest steps.\nLast year at Canc\u00fan, Mexico, delegates produced an agreement that set up a new fund to help poor countries adapt to climate changes, created new mechanisms for the transfer of clean energy technology, provided compensa- tion for the preservation of tropical forests and enshrined the emissions reductions promises that came out of the Copenhagen meeting.\nNegotiators postponed until Durban the politically freighted question of whether to extend the frayed Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 agreement that requires most wealthy nations to trim emissions while providing assistance to developing countries to pursue a cleaner energy path. Also still on the agenda are the structure and the sources of financing of a climate adaptation and technology fund that is supposed to reach $100 billion a year by 2020.\nThe most contentious question \u2014 and in some ways perhaps the least important \u2014 revolves around the future of Kyoto, which requires the major industrialized nations to meet emissions reduction targets while imposing no mandates on developing countries, including such emerging economic powers and sources of global greenhouse gas emissions as Brazil, China, India and South Africa. The United States is not a party to the protocol, having refused to consider ratifying it because of its asymmetrical obligations.\nThe protocol is up for renewal next year with some major countries, including Canada, Japan and Russia, saying they will not agree to an extension unless it is fundamentally changed to remove the unbalanced requirements for developing and developed countries. That is similar to the U.S. position, which is that any successor treaty must apply equally to all major economies, including fast-growing developing countries like China and India.\nBut the European Union, the major developing countries, and most African and Pacific island nations would like to see the Kyoto process extended as a prelude to a binding international agreement after 2020 to reduce emissions to the level needed to keep the global average temperature increase to below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), the point beyond which climate changes are believed to be catastrophic.\nTodd Stern, the chief U.S. climate negotiator, said he was flexible as to the form such a future agreement would take and even the timetable for reaching it, though he expected it would be post-2020, after the various Kyoto and Canc\u00fan agreements have run their courses. \nHe said that all countries, including the United States, must take meaningful unilateral steps to control their carbon dioxide emissions, with the obligations greatest among the 20 or so largest economies, which are responsible for more than 80 percent of global carbon output.\n\u201cIn reality, the most effective thing we can do to address climate change is for all relevant countries to act vigorously at home,\u201d Mr. Stern said, noting that most countries have adopted emissions targets or national action plans that will be followed regardless of the negotiations toward a future agreement.\n\u201cAt the same time,\u201d he added, \u201cclimate is a classic \u2018global commons\u2019 problem, where each country needs confidence that others are acting. So international cooperation is important, and this then takes you to the core international issue: You can\u2019t rationally address this problem at the international level unless you get all the major economies, developed and developing, acting in a common system.\u201d\nThe United States has been criticized at these gatherings for years, in part because it does not accept the Kyoto framework and in part because it has not adopted a comprehensive domestic program for reducing its own greenhouse gas emissions. President Barack Obama has pledged to reduce U.S. emissions 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020, but his preferred approach, a nationwide cap-and-trade system for carbon pollution, failed in Congress in 2010. U.S. emissions are down about 6 percent over the past five years, largely because of the drop in industrial and electricity production caused by the recession.\nInstead of a cap-and-trade program or a national carbon tax, the administration is promoting a number of discrete steps, including new emissions standards for cars and trucks, limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and refineries, and energy efficiency measures for buildings and appliances. Industry lobbyists and Republicans in Congress have fought against most of these measures, and significant progress seems unlikely in an election year.\nU.S. negotiators are also bracing for the now-familiar criticism that the United States has not delivered all the money it promised the most vulnerable countries for climate-change mitigation and adaptation efforts, or has sought credit toward those goals by double-counting money already pledged for other international projects. Administration officials said that Congress had been stingy with all international aid funding and that climate financing programs had suffered along with others.\nA group of nations most vulnerable to climate change declared after a meeting in mid-November in Dhaka, Bangladesh, that the rich nations had failed to make good on promises to provide immediate aid.\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Figueres, a former president of Costa Rica, said that the threatened countries like Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Ghana, Maldives, Tuvalu and Vietnam, were \u201cinsulted\u201d by the default on climate finance. And in a preview of the rich-poor drama that may emerge at Durban, as it has at previous conferences, Mr. Figueres said, \u201cI call on all countries present to occupy Durban.\u201d\nAndrew Light, a senior fellow specializing in international climate policy at the Center for American Progress in Washington, said that much of what needs to be done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can be done outside of the U.N. framework. \n\u201cAll the pledges made by the major emitters are sufficient to get us two-thirds of the reductions we need by 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to get the final third with about $60 billion in additional funding, which is why we need to get this green climate fund going. I don\u2019t expect Durban to resolve where that money is coming from, but I hope they can get the fund itself up and running. That\u2019s the quiet but most important part of the meeting.\u201d",

    "text": "Greece Tries to Shut a Back Door to Europe\n2011-02-01T01:18:32.000Z\nORESTIADA, Greece \u0097 On a chilly night recently, a half-dozen young men huddled in the shadows of the tiny train station here, stamping their feet to stay warm, waiting, though they had no money, to board a train for Athens. \nSome were from Morocco. Others from Algeria. All said they had flown into Istanbul only a few days before, taken a bus to the Greek-Turkish border and simply walked into Greece, crossing at night through fields planted with potatoes and garlic. \n \u201cA friend told me how to do it,\u201d said Yousef Silimani, 23, who like the others was neatly, even fashionably dressed. \u201cMy feet were frozen. But it was really easy.\u201d \n Ten years ago bodies were washing up on Spanish beaches as traffickers drove overloaded, rickety boats near the shore. There they forced immigrants, many of whom did not know how to swim, to jump into the sea and scramble for safety. A few years later traffickers were focused on Italy\u2019s coastline and the Greek islands. \n But after security in those areas was reinforced with patrol boats and helicopters \u0097 and Italy and Spain signed repatriation agreements with North African countries \u0097 immigrants and their traffickers adapted. \n Now it is the border between Greece and Turkey, including a 7.5-mile stretch just a few miles from here, that has become the latest crossing point for immigrants seeking entry into the European Union. In 2009, police officials say, about 3,500 immigrants came over the nearby border. In 2010, more than 10 times that many \u0097 around 36,000 \u0097 arrived. \nTwenty-one drowned in the muddy, fast-moving Evros River, which marks most of the border between Greece and Turkey.\n The wave of new immigrants hit so fast and so hard that Greek officials turned to the European Union\u2019s border management agency, Frontex, for emergency aid in patrolling the border. In January Greece announced that it would build a fence along the land border, prompting outrage from some immigrant rights groups that feared that legitimate asylum seekers, particularly from Iran and Afghanistan, would not be able to get through. \n But officials here say they have no choice. The new immigrants come at a time when Greece can least afford to be hospitable. It is struggling with huge debts and a faltering economy. Its detention centers are overflowing, lacking even such basics as soap and toilet paper. Immigrants who apply for asylum wait years for their cases to be heard. Greece has a backlog of 46,000 applications, officials say, a situation that prompted the European Court of Human Rights to fine Greece last month.\n \u201cGreece is not actually the El Dorado of Europe, and we must make it clear that it is not an option when entering Europe,\u201d said Christos Papoutsis, Greece\u2019s secretary of citizen protection. \u201cEspecially at this point in time; we just can\u2019t handle it.\u201d \nSome of those crossing the border seek refuge from war and conflict. But many, like Oussam Benchikha, 18, who was waiting for the Athens train, are just looking for a better life. \n\u201cI want to be married,\u201d said Mr. Benchikha, who said he had worked making pizzas back home in Algeria. \u201cYou need money to be married. I want to get a job right away.\u201d \nThe flood of immigrants has changed life in this town and in the tidy, whitewashed villages closer to the border, where doors were never locked before.\n Many mornings, Fani Penitidou, 31, arrives at her convenience store in Nea Vissa and sees immigrants sleeping in the small bus shelter across the street.\n \u201cYou see them on top of each other, trying to stay warm,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are just people. But they do not have a future here. Greece cannot accommodate them.\u201d \n Within days most head to Athens, where their presence has transformed neighborhoods and stirred strong anti-immigrant feelings. Few can find work and crime rates have risen, hardening sentiment against them. \nIn the last few months the city has experienced a wave of attacks on immigrants, believed to be the work of right-wing extremists. Immigrants have been beaten and stabbed in downtown Athens and in the most grievous attack, in October, assailants locked the door of a makeshift mosque and hurled firebombs through the windows, seriously wounding four worshipers. \nExperts say that trying to stop the flow of immigrants to the European Union is much like playing a game of whack-a-mole. When one entrance is cut off, another emerges.\n At the moment the Greek land border is an easy entry point compared with obstacles elsewhere.\n For one thing, Turkey recently removed visa restrictions for North Africans, so many immigrants, like the young men at the station, can fly into Istanbul for about $340. In addition, minefields near the border were largely removed a few years ago, after some immigrants were wounded. \n\u201cUsually the measures that are taken don\u2019t stop the flow, they divert it,\u201d said Anna Triandafyllidou, a migration expert with the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy. \u201cSometimes they moderate it. But mostly they just divert it.\u201d \nIn his office in Orestiada, the police chief, George Salamangas, shows off photos and videotapes of immigrants making a run over the border \u0097 a mere strip of land between parallel dirt roads, one in Turkey, the other in Greece. One video shows about two dozen young men casually emerging through tall grass. Another shows a smaller group easily outrunning the border guards to make it onto Greek soil. \nBut one series of photos shows a group, including women and children, that has been stranded on a tiny island in the middle of the river, clinging to trees to stay dry.\n Mr. Salamangas says that even 30 years ago the Greece-Turkey border was being used as an entry point by Pakistanis, Iranians and Turkish Kurds. In the last decade there were arrivals from Bangladesh, Iraq, India and Afghanistan. \n But in the last year there has been a huge increase in immigrants from Africa. Traffickers have changed their methods, too, he said. They tell the immigrants to rip up their papers and cross without any identification, claiming to be from the Palestinian territories, Afghanistan or Somalia, depending on their skin color \u0097 claims that would give them a better chance at asylum. \nMr. Salamangas says that relations with Turkish soldiers on the other side remain difficult. Despite an agreement to do so, he said, soldiers there often refuse to take back immigrants who are stopped in the tiny buffer zone that separates the countries.\n Capt. Gennaro Di Bello, the team leader of the Frontex group working in the area, said that Turkey had been doing better lately. But he said that each incident was a new negotiation, dependent on the attitude of the soldiers on the other side. \nMr. Papoutsis, the Greek secretary of citizen protection, says that the European Union involvement is crucial in helping Greece and Turkey come to an agreement on dealing with the immigrants.\n In recent weeks, since Frontex arrived with night-vision gear and heat-seeking cameras, the number of immigrants arriving each day has dropped, officials said. \nWaiting at the train station here, the young men joked and smoked cigarettes, not really sure where they were. They were astounded when they were told that Athens was more than 900 kilometers \u0097 560 miles \u0097 away. ",

    "text": "Domestic Workers Convention May Be Landmark\n2011-10-08T16:55:38.000Z\nWASHINGTON \u2014 When governments from around the globe passed a treaty in June to protect domestic workers, labor experts called it a surprising breakthrough for millions of exploited women. \nEven countries that fail to ratify the pact will eventually be judged by its standards, they said, and the campaign to pass it had enlisted fresh allies, newly mindful of abuses from unpaid wages to rape.\nTwo days later, Saudi Arabia, a major destination for domestic workers, beheaded an Indonesian maid \u2014 at once highlighting the need for protections and the challenges of putting them in place.\nThe execution followed reports from maids who said their Saudi bosses had burned or beaten them, and the condemned woman, who killed her employer, said she had been abused. But when the Indonesian president protested, the Saudis stopped hiring Indonesians and pointedly turned to cheaper workers from countries less likely to complain.\nThe twin developments \u2014 accord in Geneva and maid wars in Riyadh \u2014 show opposing forces in a global campaign to protect domestic workers, an overlooked group of as many as 100 million people.\nMore broadly, that campaign tests the effort to raise work standards in a world of cheap and mobile labor. Many domestic workers are migrants, and the precedents could shape the treatment of other migrant groups. On Sept. 30, for example, Hong Kong\u2019s High Court struck down a law that had excluded domestic workers from the residency rights offered to other foreign citizens, potentially allowing 100,000 maids to gain the right to stay.\nThe events show that \u201cofficials have not forgotten about migrant workers,\u201d said Philip Martin, an economist at the University of California, Davis. \u201cBut they are also a reminder of the difficulties of extending effective protections to them.\u201d\n\u201cThe receiving countries can always say, \u2018We will get workers somewhere else,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said.\nWhile acknowledging such challenges, the treaty\u2019s supporters say that it establishes vital new principles and that it will accelerate changes already under way. Before the pact was approved, Singapore, Jordan and New York State had passed new laws, and proposals are being considered in places as different as California and Kuwait. Even Saudi Arabia, a source of frequent abuse complaints, is considering changes that officials may feel more inclined to accept after voting for the pact.\n\u201cThe treaty was a watershed event,\u201d said Nisha Varia, a researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThere is now a global consensus that these women deserve the same rights as other workers. All the governments involved in this conversation will be under pressure to examine their labor laws.\u201d\nAs a labor force composed mostly of women who work behind closed doors, domestic workers are hard to organize and vulnerable to attack. Many countries exclude them from labor laws, leaving no legal boundaries on their hours or pay. \nIn the United States, domestic workers are covered by minimum-wage laws, but they are excluded from federal statutes on occupational health, overtime and the right to organize. \nAs long ago as 1965, the International Labor Organization, a branch of the United Nations, saw an \u201curgent need\u201d to protect domestic workers, whom it called \u201csingularly subject to exploitation.\u201d But interest in formal action waned, and women flooded the workplace, making nannies and maids a cornerstone of modern economies. \nThe export of domestic workers became big business in migration hubs like Indonesia and the Philippines, where more than half the migrants are women. Both countries celebrate the sums the women send home and simmer at the stories of mistreatment that percolate in the news media.\nSaudi Arabia is a prime destination for both countries. In 2008, a study by Ms. Varia cited dozens of cases that amounted \u201cto forced labor, trafficking, or slavery-like conditions.\u201d While abuses occur everywhere, the report said, Saudi Arabia prosecuted few cases and sometimes allowed bosses to pursue retaliatory charges, like theft, against victims who complained.\nA spokesman for the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Washington declined to comment. In the past, Saudi officials have accused critics of exaggerating isolated cases of abuse, and noted that legions of women still seek the jobs.\nWhen the international labor group turned to domestic workers in 2010, Persian Gulf states, speaking as a bloc, called for nonbinding recommendations. In a reversal this year, they supported a binding treaty.\nWhat is more, they strengthened it, with calls for stronger language on contract rights, overtime pay and access to courts during employer conflicts.\n\u201cIt really made an impression,\u201d said Ellene Sana of the Center for Migrant Advocacy in Manila. \u201cWhen you think of abuses, you think of the gulf \u2014 yet here they are, standing up for domestic workers.\u201d \nPressure from the Arab Spring, Ms. Sana said, may help explain the change. Others note that the rotating leadership of the bloc passed to the United Arab Emirates, which is conscious of the region\u2019s global reputation.\nOf the 128 governments that voted, only Swaziland opposed the pact, which says domestic workers should enjoy rights equivalent to those given to other workers in the same country, including limited workweeks, overtime pay and paid vacations. \nWhile the United States pushed hard for the pact, the Senate rarely approves labor treaties that would require changes in federal law, as this one would if ratified. Legally the pact applies only in countries that ratify it, but its uses as a yardstick may be broader. \nEven as support for the treaty grew, so did reports of abuse in Saudi Arabia. Keni binti Carda, an Indonesian maid, went home in 2008 with scars spread across her back and face. She said her employer burned her with an iron and forced her to eat excrement. \nA Sri Lankan maid, L. D. Ariyawathie, arrived home last year with two dozen nails in her body \u2014 hammered there, she said, by her employer. \nAfter an Indonesian woman, Sumiati binti Salan Mustapa, was hospitalized in Medina last year with broken bones and a mutilated face, the Indonesian president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, condemned her \u201cextraordinary torture.\u201d But the conviction of her employer was overturned.\nOn June 18, two days after the Geneva vote, Saudi Arabia beheaded an Indonesian named Ruyati binti Sapubi. Mr. Yudhoyono denounced Saudi \u201cnorms and manners,\u201d and the Saudis stopped admitting new Indonesian maids.\nThey had already placed a similar ban on the Philippines, after several Philippine lawmakers visited in January and wrote they were \u201cshocked into speechlessness by the tales of rape and abuse.\u201d Saudi recruiters then described plans to hire thousands of Bangladeshis at wages of $170 a month, less than half what the Philippine government demanded.\nMore battles may be pending. Under a new law, the Philippine government must identify which countries are acceptable destinations for domestic workers, which could prompt more conflicts like the one with the Saudis.\nStill, Philippine officials say the treaty, by laying out common principles, has given them a new weapon in an old fight. \nIt is \u201ca landmark accomplishment,\u201d said Carlos Cao Jr., who runs the Philippine government\u2019s overseas work program. \u201cBut you don\u2019t change cultures overnight.\u201d",

    "text": "In India, 11-Year Hunger Strike Is Waged in Shadows\n2011-09-10T21:58:33.000Z\nIMPHAL, India \u2014 She arrived in an ambulance, thin and ghostly pale, a tube dangling from her nostril. Flanked by police officers, she was ushered into the judge\u2019s chambers for a fortnightly ritual she has repeated hundreds of times. Was she ready to end her fast? \nIrom Chanu Sharmila, a 39-year-old poet and activist, gave her usual reply: no. With that, she was taken back to the hospital room where she spends her days in isolation, force-fed a sludgy mix of nutrients though the tube in her nose. This routine has gone on, remarkably, for 11 years.\nA recent 12-day fast by the social activist Anna Hazare paralyzed India\u2019s political system, captured the nonstop attention of its hyperkinetic 24-hour cable news media and inspired hundreds of thousands of people across the country to rally in his crusade against corruption. \nBut in India, where hunger strikes serve as a common tool of protest \u2014 playing a prominent role even in the modern state\u2019s creation \u2014 not all of them grip the public imagination in quite the same way. Ms. Sharmila\u2019s lonely, nonviolent struggle has endured in obscurity, along with her cause: to get India to remove laws that shield security forces from prosecution in this remote, insurgency-racked corner of the northeast. \nShe spends her days cut off from her supporters, her family and the news media. The authorities tightly control access to her. Still, her determination is unwavering. \u201cI am strong,\u201d Ms. Sharmila averred, eyes ablaze, in a brief interview in the judge\u2019s chambers. \u201cI am just waiting for God and his infallible judgment.\u201d\nIndia\u2019s capacious borders encompass an astounding diversity of terrain, culture, religion and ethnicity, and at its edges the country has struggled to stay true to its democratic ideals. Nowhere is that clearer than here. Manipur sits on India\u2019s northeastern fringe, along its border with Myanmar, one of the seven northeastern states that sit across the narrow neck of territory that traces Bangladesh\u2019s northern frontier and abuts China, Bhutan and Myanmar. \nIn appearance and culture its people have more in common with East Asia than distant New Delhi. Multiple insurgencies have fought for independence and autonomy in this fractious region, and the government has responded with tough military crackdowns. \nSoldiers here have a much freer hand because they are shielded from prosecution by a law known as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act of 1958. Under the law, military personnel can arrest people without a warrant, shoot to kill on suspicion and use deadly force to break up gatherings of five or more people. They cannot be prosecuted without explicit permission from the central government, which rarely comes. \nUnsurprisingly, the law has led to decades of human rights abuses. Thousands have been killed, injured, arrested and tortured with impunity, human rights workers here say. \nThe episode that prompted Ms. Sharmila to begin her fast took place on the afternoon of Nov. 2, 2000, in a village at the edge of Imphal called Malom. A mysterious explosion along the main road leading to the village sent a company of soldiers of the Assam Rifles flooding into the village. The soldiers killed 10 people, including teenagers and a 62-year-old grandmother. Seven of the dead were shot at close range while lined up at a bus stop; the other three were gunned down elsewhere in the village. \nThe soldiers claimed that they had been fired upon, but a judicial inquiry found no evidence to support their assertion. \n\u201cThe firing by the Assam Rifles personnel have resulted to the death of 10 (ten) innocent persons,\u201d said the inquiry report, which was completed last year, nearly a decade after the killings. \nAmong the dead were Chandramani Singh, a 17-year-old high school student who had won a national award for bravery for saving his younger brother from drowning in a fish pond when he was 4 years old. He had traveled to New Delhi to receive a clover-leaf-shaped medal from then-Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. His older brother, Robin, was also killed. \n\u201cThe family was completely shattered,\u201d said Manichandra Singh, the brother Chandramani had plucked from the fishing pond, now a 25-year-old doctor. \u201cMy two brothers who were living together with me suddenly killed in cold blood by those fellows.\u201d \nTwo days after the massacre, Ms. Sharmila sat on a hand-woven rug beneath a metal roof along the main road and hung up a sign that read \u201cHunger Strike,\u201d said Babloo Loitangbam, a human rights activist and adviser to Ms. Sharmila. Her goal was to get the central government to revoke the Armed Forces Special Powers Act so that the men who carried out the attack on Malom could be prosecuted. \n\u201cWe thought it was going to be a few weeks,\u201d Mr. Loitangbam said. \u201cA month at most.\u201d\nAlmost immediately she was arrested under a clause of the Indian penal code that makes attempting suicide a crime. She was hospitalized and force-fed, a practice the World Medical Association deems \u201ca form of inhuman and degrading treatment.\u201d \nEver since then she has been shuttled between hospitals and courtrooms, making an appearance every 15 days to reaffirm her wish to starve herself to death. Once a year the court is obliged to release her \u2014 the maximum sentence for the crime she is accused of is one year. She is usually arrested the following day. \nWhen she was released in 2006, allies helped smuggle her into New Delhi, where she briefly staged a hunger strike at Jantar Mantar, a popular site of protests in the capital. But she was again arrested, hospitalized and force-fed, then sent back to Manipur. She has not left the state since. \nMs. Sharmila passes her days in almost complete solitude. Convicted criminals are allowed two visits per week, but she is kept in isolation in her hospital room. She does four hours of yoga a day and reads many books; her room is lined with biographies of Nelson Mandela, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi, heroes of nonviolent struggles like hers.\nBut she is not averse to lighter fare. Asked what she had been reading lately, her eyes grew wide. \n\u201cStieg Larsson!\u201d she replied, with a giggle. \u201cVery impressive.\u201d \nShe said she had heard of Mr. Hazare and admired his dedication to his cause. \n\u201cI feel very good thinking about his courage,\u201d she said. \nMr. Hazare and his allies had written her a letter inviting her to join their struggle against corruption. \n\u201cI cannot get the advantage of exercising my nonviolent protest for justice against my concerned authority as a democratic citizen of a democratic country,\u201d she wrote in reply. \u201cLet me get free, like yours, to join your amazing crusade to root out corruption \u2014 which is the root of all evils. Or you can come to Manipur, the most corruption affected region in the world,\u201d she also wrote. \nActivists like Ms. Sharmila have been working to get the security laws here dropped for years, to little effect. Debates about Manipur\u2019s human rights problems are more likely to be heard in international venues, like the United Nations and the European Parliament, than in New Delhi. \nNow Mr. Hazare\u2019s fast has shone new light on Ms. Sharmila\u2019s struggle. Mr. Loitangbam has been inundated by calls from the Indian news media, and a senior government minister, Salman Kursheed, also called, asking how Ms. Sharmila\u2019s fast could be ended, he said. Mr. Hazare himself has expressed interest in visiting Ms. Sharmila in Manipur. But many here worry about some of the nationalist elements that have rallied to his side. \n\u201cOn the one hand, Anna is giving us a spotlight,\u201d Mr. Loitangbam said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want to be completely absorbed into it.\u201d \nMs. Sharmila said she had no intention of giving up her fast until she gets the justice she seeks. \n\u201cUntil and unless my demand is fulfilled, I will be passing my life in this way,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no other way.\u201d",

    "text": "You Want to Track Me? Here You Go, F.B.I.\n2011-10-29T21:30:46.000Z\nON June 19, 2002, I ran into a bit of a problem that turned my life upside down. It happened at the Detroit airport as I was entering the country. I realized something wasn\u2019t right when the immigration agent at United States Customs slid my passport through the reader, then froze. \u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d I asked. He was still frozen. After a few moments, he said, \u201cFollow me, please,\u201d and I ended up at the Immigration and Naturalization Service\u2019s airport office. \nIt was a large room filled with foreign-looking people, and fear was written on all their faces; this was their first day in the United States, and things were evidently not going well. Typically, there is little overlap between the I.N.S. and American citizens like me, and when I tried to find out from one of the agents what I was doing there, he seemed just as confused as I was. \nEventually, a man in a dark suit approached and said, \u201cI expected you to be older.\u201d I asked if he could please explain what was happening, and he said, \u201cYou have some explaining to do yourself.\u201d \nWe then entered an interrogation room, barren and stark white with a camera in the corner. He sat across from me at an L-shaped desk and asked me to retrace the path I\u2019d taken since I had left the United States. He asked me various detailed questions for a good half hour and then, out of nowhere, said, \u201cWhere were you September 12?\u201d\nFortunately, I\u2019m neurotic about record keeping. I had my Palm P.D.A. with me; I looked up Wednesday, Sept. 12, 2001 on my calendar. I read him the contents: \u201cpay storage rent at 10; meeting with Judith at 10:30; intro class from 12 to 3; advanced class from 3 to 6.\u201d We read about six months of my calendar appointments. I don\u2019t think he was expecting me to have such detailed records.\nHe continued, \u201cYou had a storage unit in Tampa, right?\u201d\n\u201cYes, near the university.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you have in it?\u201d\n\u201cBoxes of winter clothes, furniture I can\u2019t fit in my apartment, some assorted junk and garage sale material.\u201d\n\u201cNo explosives?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m certain I didn\u2019t have any explosives.\u201d\n\u201cWell, we received a report that you had explosives and had fled on September 12.\u201d\nGiven that I was very cooperative, and also had meticulous records that showed what I did when, I think he began to realize that whatever report he had was erroneous. \nA few weeks later, a Justice Department official called my office in Tampa and said he wanted to speak to me about my interview in Detroit. He asked me to come to the Federal Building downtown, where he led me into a room where he and an F.B.I. agent interrogated me about where I\u2019d been and when, and had I witnessed acts that might be detrimental to the interests of the United States or a foreign country, and had I ever met anyone from Al Qaeda, Islamic Jihad, Hamas or Hezbollah. The F.B.I. agent seemed to know quite remarkable details about things like the regular versus the Hezbollah bus routes in Beirut, and the person memorialized in the statue at the entrance of the American University there. His knowledge frightened me. \nI COULD have contested the legality of the investigation and gotten a lawyer. But I thought that would make things messier. It was clear who had the power in this situation. And when you\u2019re face to face with someone with so much power, you behave in an unusual manner. You dare not take any action. You rely on instincts and do what you need to survive. I told them everything. \nThe questioning went on for the next six months and ended with a series of polygraph examinations. I must have completed these to the agents\u2019 satisfaction; eventually an interrogating agent told me that I had been cleared and that everything was fine and said that if I needed anything I should call him. I was planning to travel in the weeks ahead and was nervous about entering the country; I asked the agent about this, and he told me to call him with the information about my flights and said he would take care of everything. \nShortly after, I called the F.B.I. to report my whereabouts. I chose to. I wanted to make sure that the bureau knew that I wasn\u2019t making any sudden moves and that I wasn\u2019t running off somewhere. I wanted them to know where I was and what I was doing at any given time. \nSoon I began to e-mail the F.B.I. I started to send longer e-mails, with pictures, and then with links to Web sites I made. I wrote some clunky code for my phone back in 2003 and turned it into a tracking device. \nMy thinking was something like, \u201cYou want to watch me? Fine. But I can watch myself better than you can, and I can get a level of detail that you will never have.\u201d \nIn the process of compiling data about myself and supplying it to the F.B.I., I started thinking about what intelligence agents might not know about me. I created a list of every flight I\u2019ve ever been on, since birth. For the more recent flights, I noted the exact flight numbers, recorded in my frequent flier accounts, and also photographs of the meals that I ate on each flight, as well as photos of each knife provided by each airline on each flight. \nOn my Web site, I compiled various databases that show the airports I\u2019ve been in, food I\u2019ve eaten at home, food I\u2019ve eaten on the road, random hotel beds I\u2019ve slept in, various parking lots off Interstate 80 that I parked in, empty train stations I saw, as well as very specific information like photos of the tacos I ate in Mexico City between July 5 and 7, and the toilets I used. \nThese images seem empty, and could be anywhere, but they\u2019re not; they are extremely specific records of my exact travels to particular places. There are 46,000 images on my site. I trust that the F.B.I. has seen all of them. Agents know where I\u2019ve bought my duck-flavored paste, or kimchi, laundry detergent and chitlins; because I told them everything. \nI also provided screenshots of my financial data, communications records and transportation logs. Visitors to my site can cross-reference these records with my images in a way that\u2019s similar to how the F.B.I. cross-references the very same databases. I provided information from third parties (including my bank, phone company, etc.) who can verify that I was at the locations indicated, on the dates and times specified on my Web site.\nPEOPLE who visit my site \u2014 and my server logs indicate repeat visits from the Department of Homeland Security, the C.I.A., the National Reconnaissance Office and the Executive Office of the President \u2014 don\u2019t find my information organized clearly. In fact, the interface I use is deliberately user-unfriendly. A lot of work is required to thread together the thousands of available points of information. By putting everything about me out there, I am simultaneously telling everything and nothing about my life. Despite the barrage of information about me that is publicly available, I live a surprisingly private and anonymous life. \nIn an era in which everything is archived and tracked, the best way to maintain privacy may be to give it up. Information agencies operate in an industry that values data. Restricted access to information is what makes it valuable. If I cut out the middleman and flood the market with my information, the intelligence the F.B.I. has on me will be of no value. Making my private information public devalues the currency of the information the intelligence gatherers have collected. \nMy activities may be more symbolic than not, but if 300 million people started sending private information to federal agents, the government would need to hire as many as another 300 million people, possibly more, to keep up with the information and we\u2019d have to redesign our entire intelligence system. \nEast Germany tried this some decades back; it didn\u2019t work out to be such a great plan for them. We have incredibly intelligent people and very sophisticated computer systems in various agencies in Washington, but the culture of these agencies prevents us from evolving beyond the cold-war-era mind-set. (There are people in Washington who still refer to China as \u201cRed China.\u201d) Fortunately, people in government have begun to see that collecting information is less useful than figuring out how to analyze it. \nWhen I first started talking about my project in 2003, people thought I was insane. Why would anyone tell everyone what he was doing at all times? Why would anyone want to share a photo of every place he visited? Now eight years later, more than 800 million people do the same thing I\u2019ve been doing each time they update their status or post an image or poke someone on Facebook. (Just to put this in perspective, if Facebook was a country, it would have the third highest population, after China and India.) Insane?\nWhat I\u2019m doing is no longer just an art project; creating our own archives has become so commonplace that we\u2019re all \u2014 or at least hundreds of millions of us \u2014 doing it all the time. Whether we know it or not. ",

    "text": "Fleeing Migrant Workers Pile Up at Libya\u2019s Borders\n2011-03-01T08:25:13.000Z\nSALUM, Egypt \u0097 The no man\u2019s land between the Libyan and Egyptian border checkpoints here has become a sprawling, ragged boardinghouse for thousands of poor migrant workers trying to flee Libya.\nMore than 700 Bangladeshi workers have been living on the floor of the arrival and departure halls for up to a week, turning the floor into a carpet of cardboard boxes, polyester blankets, banged-up suitcases and biscuit wrappers. On stretches of litter-strewn pavement, migrants from sub-Saharan Africa, Thailand and the Philippines shroud themselves in blankets and curl up on the pavement to sleep amid their belongings in the cold.\nTaken by surprise by the spiraling conflict in Libya, international aid workers have not caught up with the enormous logistical challenge of transporting the tens of thousands of migrant workers who are leaving Libya, most of whom have no transit visas and no money to pay for plane tickets.\nFrom Egypt on Tuesday, the International Organization for Migration, a United Nations affiliate, secured a charter plane to fly 174 Bangladeshis back to Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, and found other plane seats for nearly 100 Vietnamese. But the arrival hall here is still packed with people complaining of insufficient food and poor sanitary conditions, and more keep coming.\nSome 3,000 people slept in the border zone on Tuesday, a small number compared with those at the Tunisian-Libyan border to the west, where the authorities are setting up a camp that can hold 20,000. Though conditions are difficult, the zone remains relatively calm and organized, in part because 60,000 of the 78,000 migrants who have crossed are Egyptians who quickly boarded buses provided by the army and headed home.\nAt the Tunisian border, there are growing reports of chaos, with news reports and witnesses saying Tunisian guards fired into the air repeatedly on Tuesday when a crowd of refugees sought to clamber over a wall and border guards responded by beating them back with sticks. \nThe huge numbers entering Tunisia \u0097 some 70,000 had crossed by Tuesday \u0097 had simply outpaced the ability of the government to deal with them, said Firos Kayal, the United Nations refugee agency\u2019s representative posted to the Tunisian border. \u201cIt is a humanitarian emergency,\u201d he said of the situation there. \u201cThe Tunisians have been generous, but they have reached a point of saturation and they need assistance.\u201d\nThe number of Libyans crossing either border is far fewer. Of the 3,500 Libyans who have crossed into Egypt, all have friends or family in Egypt and none have required assistance, said Elizabeth Tan, the deputy representative in Cairo for the refugee agency. \nBut for workers from countries that would normally need visas to enter Egypt, the border has become a sea of red tape. Stacks of handwritten visa applications sit in a packed immigration office, waiting for embassies to sign off on their citizens. The Egyptian government will allow entry only to those migrants with a plane ticket, so the International Office of Migration has become a harried travel agency searching for spare seats on flights for places like Guinea and Mali.\n \u201cWe are not sure what is happening,\u201d said Jahidul Islam, 24, who was working at a Hyundai-owned power plant near Benghazi, Libya, making $3,000 a year. He fled a week ago after his camp was attacked by gunmen, he said, but he was still waiting to find out from the Bangladeshi Embassy what was happening. He complained of hunger, as did others. One Bangladeshi official at the border said that an emergency coordinator for the I.O.M. had been trying to arrange visas for three straight days and nights.\nMigrants had many reasons for leaving. Some said their companies in Libya had shut, leaving them stranded. Others said they were just afraid. Bassiro Cande, a 41-year-old from Guinea, was among several people who said they had been either threatened or beaten in recent days, as rebels mistook them for African mercenaries whom Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi had brought in from countries to the south. \n \u201cBefore only the police would beat us, now the people did as well,\u201d Mr. Cande said. \u201cPeople thought we were fighting for Qaddafi, but we were innocent.\u201d\n Asammoah Solomon, 32, from Ghana, who was waiting to board a bus, said, \u201cWe became enemies to the Libyan people.\u201d He said a crowd in Benghazi had rushed at him and three other Ghanaians with sticks, \u201cso we ran.\u201d \nOn Monday, the United Nations said it flew out 216 Guineans, 15 Moroccans and 35 Bangladeshis. On Tuesday, Ghana sent buses for hundreds of its citizens, and on Wednesday, 174 people will be put on a charter plane to Dhaka. So far, the United Nations and the Egyptian Army are the only organizations that seem to be helping.\nOnly one group was being turned back at the border: Palestinians, said Mai Mahmoud, a United Nations worker in Salum. Egyptian authorities had returned 33 Palestinians to Libya on Tuesday, including children, and two more families were being threatened with expulsion.\n \u201cObviously we are very concerned about this,\u201d Ms. Mahmoud said, \u201cand we are going to follow up with the authorities.\u201d",

    "text": "Nobel Laureate Loses Last Legal Battle to Save Job at Bank\n2011-04-05T12:51:38.000Z\nNEW DELHI \u2014 Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Bangladeshi microfinance pioneer who popularized the notion of giving tiny loans to the poor, lost his legal battle on Tuesday to hold on to his job as managing director of the bank he created more than 30 years ago.\nLast month, Bangladesh\u2019s central bank ordered that Mr. Yunus be dismissed from his post at Grameen Bank, the institution he founded and with which he shared the peace prize in 2006. A lower court rejected his challenge to the order, and on Tuesday, the country\u2019s highest court rejected his appeal.\n\u201cThey passed a one-word order: dismissed,\u201d said Sara Hossein, one of Mr. Yunus\u2019s lawyers. She said Mr. Yunus\u2019s lawyers would ask the court to review its decision, which was made with uncommon speed.\nThe court did not address a petition from the bank\u2019s board to be able to retain Mr. Yunus, but its ruling upholding his dismissal would appear to render it moot. The ruling is the most recent development in a lengthy and increasingly acrimonious battle over the control of Grameen Bank between the government and Mr. Yunus, an economist who is celebrated around the world for bringing banking services to the poor, but who has fallen out of favor with the leaders of his country.\nThe push to remove Mr. Yunus started last year after a Norwegian documentary accused him and Grameen, which has 8.3 million borrowers, of improperly transferring to an affiliate $100 million that had been donated by Norway. The money was retransferred after Norwegian officials complained. In a statement last year, Norway cleared Grameen and Mr. Yunus of wrongdoing.\nBut the case opened the bank to unprecedented scrutiny. Sheikh Hasina Wazed, the prime minister of Bangladesh, said Mr. Yunus and other microfinance firms were \u201csucking blood from the poor in the name of poverty alleviation.\u201d The government stepped up its supervision of the bank, arguing that it was poorly governed.\nMrs. Hasina and Mr. Yunus, who has been critical of politicians, were once close, but their relationship soured when Mr. Yunus briefly floated a political party in 2007.\nEla Bhatt, who leads the Self-Employed Women\u2019s Association in India, a nonprofit organization that also operates a cooperative bank, said the ruling was a blow to antipoverty organizations that work to empower poor women.",

    "text": "Bengali Spoken Here\n2011-10-03T22:47:04.000Z\nGOOD Bangladeshi cooking is hard to come by in New York. Though \u201cBangladesh\u201d is stamped on many menus, too often these are passports to food from other parts of the subcontinent. The longtime touchstone, Spicy Mina, in Woodside, Queens, went dark last year, supplanted by a Nepali spot that also turns out pizza.\nOne place that lovers of the cuisine have turned to is Parkchester in the Bronx, where Mohammed Rahman owns Neerob. It is on a low-rise stretch of Starling Avenue that is home to numerous Bangladeshi-owned businesses. His modest, sunny establishment serves as a de facto social center, partly for the genial atmosphere \u2014 all the customers seem to know Mr. Rahman by his nickname, Khokon \u2014 but principally for the food.\nMustard oil hums through Bangladeshi dishes like low-wattage horseradish and yet \u2014 at least as prepared by the chef, Mohammed Islam \u2014 it does not add an oily texture. Fish is the favorite protein, and garlic, turmeric, chiles and cumin power many dishes. Side plates provide a last-minute zing from more chiles, or whole cilantro or raw onion or lime.\nNeerob\u2019s offerings change daily, so the paper menu is an unreliable guide; a whiteboard is timelier but not illuminating. Best to survey the multihued (but unlabeled) steam-table display and deal directly with the servers. Bengali is the lingua franca, but you can manage in English.\nLook first for Neerob\u2019s exceptional bhartas ($4 each). Literally \u201cmashed\u201d dishes, they typically feature vegetables like spinach, potato and eggplant, perhaps in partnership with fish or shrimp. Four or five bhartas are available each day, and it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to order a $1 dollop of each. Many other portions and prices are equally fungible. Sharing moderates the tab and adds to the enjoyment.\nA party of two, for example, might sample all the available bhartas and split an order of dal ($3), soupy yellow lentils bright with cumin, ginger and garlic, to spoon over their plates of rice. Two or three shared plates of fish, vegetables or meat \u2014 each, traditionally, added to its own pristine patch of rice \u2014 round out a meal.\nThe featured items in Neerob\u2019s fish dishes ($5 to $10) are imported and, often, inscrutable. Most are also delicious, especially ilish, pan-fried with onions and chiles; the bony, oil-rich flesh resembles shad. Small catfish called tangra, in a thin red curry, seem almost boneless; the pale mild flesh pulls away easily from the spine. Minnowlike keski are served in a tomato-and-onion sauce vibrant with finger-staining turmeric; they can be gobbled whole.\nVegetable dishes ($3 to $4) are more readily identifiable. Anything with spinach is good, particularly alu palang, mildly spiced and mixed with potato. Eggplant, long beans, cabbage and kidney beans appear frequently, in various guises \u2014 again, sometimes in combination with fish. Ask, too, after kochur loti, pale green taro shoots saut\u00e9ed with olives.\nA rotating roster of meaty curries features chicken, beef or goat ($5 to $6). Less adventurous eaters might fall back on creamy, pinkish chicken tikka masala ($6), a scarlet leg of chicken tandoori ($2.50), perhaps the biriyani of the day ($7 to $9). The vegetable fritters called pakoras (three for $1) are delightful when fresh; so are overstuffed fried samosas ($1 each).\nSince Neerob is halal, no alcohol is permitted on the premises.

    "text": "A Warning as Markets Cool in Asia\n2011-01-12T16:15:24.000Z\nMUMBAI, India \u0097 Stock markets in India and a handful of other, smaller Asian countries, which surged last year as foreign investors bet on their fast growth, are starting to remind investors of the risks involved. \nThe Indian stock market has fallen more than 7 percent from a record high set in November, as investors have grown increasingly concerned about inflation and corruption scandals that have paralyzed the country\u2019s Parliament. The Nifty 50 stock index did close up 1.9 percent on Wednesday, but that came after a six-day losing streak.\nMeanwhile, the stock market in Bangladesh, which jumped 96 percent last year, has tumbled 27 percent in recent weeks after regulators tightened rules to limit speculation. That market, which went into a free fall on Monday, setting off riots, recovered some of those losses in the last two days after the government eased regulations to make it easier for investors to borrow money. Stock markets in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines have also fallen in recent days, though not as sharply.\nThe stumble has not extended to more established exchanges in Asian emerging markets. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up more than 4 percent in the last month and more than 8 percent over the last 52 weeks. \nAnd the MSCI Asia APEX 50 Index, a broad measure of Asian stocks excluding Japan, is up 5 percent over the last month and nearly 14 percent over the last 52 weeks. \nBut the recent pullback in less established and more volatile Asian stock markets serves as a warning to foreign investors who poured billions of dollars into emerging markets last year: in spite of their long-term potential, these fast-growing countries still face numerous challenges. \nMany countries are battling high and still-rising inflation, especially in food and energy, and their policy makers are worried about bubbles forming in their financial systems, said Russell Napier, a strategist at the investment firm CLSA in London.\n\u201cInflation will be an endemic problem in the emerging markets,\u201d Mr. Napier said. \u201cWe are not going to solve this inflation in a quarter or two quarters.\u201d\nIn India, prices remain stubbornly high even as the country\u2019s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, has raised key interest rates by up to 2 percentage points. A recent surge in vegetable prices has put staples like onions beyond the reach of many consumers. Food prices jumped 18 percent at the wholesale level at the end of December, compared with the same period a year ago.\nMany analysts, who had hoped that the Indian central bank would not raise rates again, are now expecting policy makers to increase borrowing costs again later this month. That would dampen the country\u2019s growth, which is already showing signs of weakening. On Wednesday, the government reported that industrial production grew just 2.7 percent in November, on a year-over-year basis, down from 11.3 percent in October.\n\u201cThere is a risk of this becoming the classic situation of low growth and high inflation, where central bankers dither about what to do,\u201d said Samiran Chakraborty, regional head of research at Standard Chartered Bank in Mumbai.\nAnalysts have also grown concerned about the scope and reach of corruption in the country after scandals have tainted the country\u2019s telecommunications, banking and real estate sectors. A government auditor has estimated that improper allocation of wireless spectrum to favored mobile phone companies might have cost the country nearly $40 billion in revenue, compared to what it might have earned through an auction.\nWhile most investors are accustomed to corruption in developing countries like India, the recent scandals suggest that demands for bribes have become more arbitrary and repetitive in nature, said Saurabh Mukherjea, who heads the equity business at Ambit Capital, a Mumbai-based investment firm.\n\u201cThere has been a fairly decisive change,\u201d Mr. Mukherjea said. \u201cBoth domestic and foreign investors have realized that the nature of corruption has been fundamentally altered.\u201d\nIn the recent sell-off, investors have driven down the price of bank, real estate and energy companies that are more reliant on politicians and bureaucrats. At the same time, they have bid up the price of technology and pharmaceutical companies that earn much of their revenue outside the country and are less entangled with the government.\nInvestors are also frustrated that scandals appear to have paralyzed the government and policy making in New Delhi. \u201cEverybody was banking on this government delivering big time on the reform process,\u201d said Mr. Chakraborty of Standard Chartered. \u201cAnd that is not moving.\u201d\nLast year, opposition political parties blocked proceedings in Parliament. They are now threatening to disrupt the forthcoming debate on the government\u2019s next budget unless the ruling Congress party allows a parliamentary committee to investigate the telecom scandal.\nThe individual circumstances of the sell-off in other countries are somewhat different from India\u2019s, but also speak to the growing pains that emerging markets often encounter as they rush headlong into the future.\nIn Bangladesh, for instance, government efforts to curb speculation in stocks by banks and individual investors led to a sharp sell-off on the Dhaka Stock Exchange in December and earlier this month. Regulators were forced to suspend trading on Monday after the benchmark DSE General index fell 9 percent and investors protesting the decline clashed with baton-wielding police officers. \nThe market started recovering on Tuesday, after the government reversed some of its recent decisions, making it easier for investors to borrow money to buy shares. But analysts and investors remain concerned that the rebound will be short-lived, because the market is still very expensive relative to corporate profits.",

If a mother suffers from bleeding in such a setting, she risks shock, organ failure and eventually death. Short of an airlift to a hospital where transfusions and surgery are available, there is often little to be done.\nNow there is an ingenious low-tech medical solution called the LifeWrap. Like a segmented wetsuit that fastens around the legs and torso with Velcro, the skin-tight suit squeezes oxygenated blood back into the heart, lungs and brain of the hemorrhaging mother.\nThis helps her to regain consciousness, avoid organ damage and stay alive long enough to be moved to better care.\nDescended from inflatable suits used in operating rooms and battlefields, the garment can get a little uncomfortable in warmer climates. And at $295 (made by Zoex in Coloma, Calif.), it\u2019s not yet cheap enough to become widespread in remote villages.\nBut the device works. It is used on a modest scale in India, Bangladesh, Tanzania and Peru.\nEarly trials in Egypt and Nigeria by Dr. Suellen Miller, a professor of obstetrics at the University of California, San Francisco, showed it could reduce childbirth deaths by over 50 percent. Results in Zambia and Zimbabwe are pending.\n\u201cWomen are still dying of birth hemorrhage in the poorest countries,\u201d Dr. Miller said. \u201cThis is a very potent first-aid device that could have a huge impact in reducing mortality.\u201d\n",

    "text": "Bank Warns of Effects of Rising Food Prices on Asia\n2011-04-25T11:04:58.000Z\nBANGKOK \u2014 Sharp rises in food prices are a threat to economic growth in Asia and could push millions of people into extreme poverty, the Asian Development Bank said in a report to be released on Tuesday. \nFood prices in Asia have increased an average of about 10 percent so far this year, which the bank calculates could force 64 million people below the poverty income threshold of $1.25 per person a day if prices remain at current levels. \n\u201cWhenever we say that Asia\u2019s growth rate is booming and Asia is a new global growth center, people misunderstand the point,\u201d said Changyong Rhee, the chief economist of the bank, which is supported by governments and helps finance infrastructure projects around the region, among other activities. \u201cAsia is home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor. There is still a long way to go.\u201d \nAsia is a major contributor to global inflation and is vulnerable to its effects. Growth in China and India is blamed for pushing up prices of many commodities. The region\u2019s population density and uneven income distribution make people there especially susceptible to spikes in food prices, Mr. Rhee said. The poor in Asia typically spend about two-thirds of their income on food. \nA continued rise in prices for food and fuel could leave Asia\u2019s consumers with less disposable income to spend on electronics, clothing and other products. Inflation could also spur central banks to further raise interest rates. Taken together, this could slow down economic growth by as much as 1.5 percentage points this year, the development bank has calculated. \nMuch depends on whether prices continue to climb. On Monday, Barclays Capital, a securities firm, reported that food prices in Vietnam, one of the countries worst hit by inflation, rose 24 percent over the last 12 months, the fastest pace in more than two years. \nBut Prakriti Sofat, the analyst at Barclays who wrote the firm\u2019s report, predicted that prices in Vietnam, especially for rice, would fall in the coming months as farmers who were hoping for even higher prices sold off their stocks with the arrival of a new harvest. \n\u201cWe believe rice prices should taper off as the spring harvest begins in May,\u201d Ms. Sofat said. \nMr. Rhee of the Asian Development Bank also expects a moderation in food prices later this year, but he fears it could lull governments into inaction. \n\u201cIt\u2019s time for us to talk about long-term investments in food to make sure this problem is not recurring,\u201d he said. \nPoor countries that are net food importers are the most vulnerable to the increases, Mr. Rhee said, citing Bangladesh, the Philippines, India and Sri Lanka. \nIn theory, the winners from higher food prices in Asia are countries like Thailand, a major food exporter. Indeed, the countryside in Thailand has shown some signs of vitality. \nCar dealerships in regions heavy with plantations have reported sharp increases in sales as a result of rising prices of palm oil and rubber. Sales of pickup trucks nationwide were up 25 percent in March from a year earlier. \nBut farmers were also being hit by the rising price of oil, both for fertilizers made from petroleum products and fuel for their machinery.",

    "text": "Microlenders, Honored With Nobel, Are Struggling\n2011-01-05T16:17:00.000Z\nMUMBAI, India \u0097 Microcredit is losing its halo in many developing countries. \nMicrocredit was once extolled by world leaders like Bill Clinton and Tony Blair as a powerful tool that could help eliminate poverty, through loans as small as $50 to cowherds, basket weavers and other poor people for starting or expanding businesses. But now microloans have prompted political hostility in Bangladesh, India, Nicaragua and other developing countries. \nIn December, the prime minister of Bangladesh, Sheik Hasina Wazed, who had championed microloans alongside President Clinton at talks in Washington in 1997, turned her back on them. She said microlenders were \u201csucking blood from the poor in the name of poverty alleviation,\u201d and she ordered an investigation into Grameen Bank, which had pioneered microcredit and, with its founder, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.\nHere in India, until recently home to the world\u2019s fastest-growing microcredit businesses, lending has slowed sharply since the state with the most microloans adopted a strict law restricting lending. In Nicaragua, Pakistan and Bolivia, activists and politicians have urged borrowers not to repay their loans.\nThe hostility toward microfinance is a sharp reversal from the praise and good will that politicians, social workers and bankers showered on the sector in the last decade. Philanthropists and investors poured billions of dollars into nonprofit and profit-making microlenders, who were considered vital players in achieving the United Nations\u2019 ambitious Millennium Development Goals for 2015 that world leaders set in 2000. One of the goals was to reduce by half the number of people in extreme poverty. \nThe attention lavished on microcredit helped the sector reach more than 91 million customers, most of them women, with loans totaling more than $70 billion by the end of 2009. India and Bangladesh together account for half of all borrowers.\nBut as with other trumpeted development initiatives that have promised to lift hundreds of millions from poverty, microcredit has struggled to turn rhetoric into tangible success. \nDone right, these loans have shown promise in allowing some borrowers to build sustainable livelihoods. But it has also become clear that the rapid growth of microcredit \u0097 in India some lending firms were growing at 60 percent to 100 percent a year \u0097 has made the loans much less effective. \nMost borrowers do not appear to be climbing out of poverty, and a sizable minority is getting trapped in a spiral of debt, according to studies and analysts.\n\u201cCredit is both the source of possibilities and it\u2019s a bond,\u201d said David Roodman, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, a research organization in Washington. \u201cCredit is often operating at this knife\u2019s edge, and that gets forgotten.\u201d\nEven as the results for borrowers have been mixed, some lenders have minted profits that might make Wall Street bankers envious. For instance, investors in India\u2019s largest microcredit firm, SKS Microfinance, sold shares last year for as much as 95 times what they paid for them a few years earlier. \nMeanwhile, politicians in developing nations, some of whom had long resented microlenders as competitors for the hearts and minds of the poor, have taken to depicting lenders as profiteering at the expense of borrowers.\nNicaragua\u2019s president, Daniel Ortega, for example, supported \u201cmovimiento no pago,\u201d or the no-pay movement, which was started in 2008 by farmers after some borrowers could not pay their debts. Partly as a result of that campaign, a judge recently ordered the liquidation of one of the country\u2019s leading microlenders, Banco del Exito, or Success Bank. \n\u201cThese crises happen when the microfinance sector gets saturated, when it grows too fast, and the mechanisms for controlling overindebtedness is not very well developed,\u201d said Elisabeth Rhyne, a senior official at Accion International, a organization in Boston that invests in microlenders. \u201cOn the political side, politicians or political actors take advantage of an opportunity. When they see grievances, they go, \u2018Wow, we can make some hay with this.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nWhile a broad thread of resentment and disenchantment runs across the globe, the hostility toward microcredit stems from different circumstances in each nation.\nIn Bangladesh, Ms. Hasina appears to have become embittered with Grameen after its founder, Muhammad Yunus, who shared the Nobel, announced in 2007 that he would start a political party. At that time, the country was ruled by a caretaker government appointed by the military. Though Mr. Yunus later gave up on the idea, analysts say Ms. Hasina and Mr. Yunus have not made amends.\nMs. Hasina\u2019s recent comments about microcredit were prompted by a Norwegian documentary that accused Grameen of improperly transferring to an affiliate $100 million that Norway had donated to it more than a decade ago. Ms. Hasina said Grameen, 3.4 percent of which is owned by the government, might have transferred the money to avoid taxes. \nThe bank, which has denied that accusation, reversed the transfer after Norwegian officials objected to it. Norway recently issued a statement clearing Grameen of wrongdoing.\nThe prime minister\u2019s press secretary did not return calls seeking comment.\nIn India, leaders in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, which accounts for about a third of the country\u2019s microloans, have accused lenders of impoverishing customers. Stories proliferated in the local news media about women who had amassed debts of $1,000 or more as loan officers cajoled them into borrowing more than they could afford and then browbeat them to repay. Many had used the money to pay for televisions or health care or to soften the blow of failed crops, rather than as seed money for businesses.\nMicrocredit firms in India were also accused of siphoning borrowers from government-run \u201cself-help groups\u201d \u0097 women\u2019s organizations that can borrow small amounts at subsidized interest rates from government-owned banks. \nThe movement against microcredit was started by opposition politicians, who have encouraged borrowers not to repay their loans and have accused senior leaders of the ruling Congress Party of being in cahoots with lenders. The Congress-led state government made the cause its own and passed a tough new law in December to cap interest rates and regulate collections.\nThe crisis has had ripples across the nation. Banks, the primary source of money for microlenders, have turned off the tap because they are worried about the industry\u2019s future. As a result, microlenders have slowed or stopped lending nationwide.\nGrameen Financial Services, a microlender in Bangalore that is not related to Grameen Bank, has idled 600 new employees it hired just a few months earlier with plans to expand into western and central India. The firm does not lend in Andhra Pradesh.\n\u201cThis is frustrating,\u201d said Suresh K. Krishna, managing director of Grameen Financial. \u201cThis is not what we set out for. The whole objective of floating this was to support entrepreneurs and support people in the rural areas and people below the poverty line.\u201d\nIndustry leaders say they hope the issues will be resolved soon. The federal government and the Reserve Bank of India, the country\u2019s central bank, are working on new federal regulations to oversee microcredit, said Alok Prasad, chief executive of the Microfinance Institutions Network.\nStill, some industry officials acknowledge that the sector needs to reform itself to overcome political opposition and live up to its promise. They say organizations that now offer only loans need to diversify into microsavings accounts, which many specialists assert are much better than loans at easing poverty. \nThe industry, they say, also needs to speed up efforts to build a credit bureau that would reduce overlending. And organizations need to measure their success not just by growth and profits, but by how fast their customers are getting out of poverty, experts say.\n\u201cWe at microfinance have a job to do to make it easier for politicians to support us,\u201d said Alex Counts, the chief executive of the Grameen Foundation, a nonprofit in Washington that is not part of Grameen Bank. \u201cRather than make claims that get out in front of the research, we need to impose on ourselves the discipline of transparency about poverty reduction.\u201d",

    "text": "Jackson Heights Awakens to a Cricket Bat\u2019s Crack\n2011-03-30T18:55:25.000Z\nIf there seemed to be a shortage of taxis at 5 a.m. on Wednesday, one possible reason was apparent on the streets of Jackson Heights in Queens.\nDozens of cabs were parked, end to end, along the curbs in front of several cafes, restaurants and shops in the neighborhood, the heart of New York\u2019s South Asian diaspora. Inside, the cabbies \u2014 and scores of their countrymen \u2014 had gathered with jittery anticipation in front of wide-screen televisions. The semifinal of the cricket World Cup tournament between India and Pakistan, archrivals in politics and sport, was about to commence. \nSome, mainly the rabid fans of those teams, called the match the sport\u2019s most important in recent history. It was certainly one of the most hyped. \nIn Mohali, India, where the game was being played, the government deployed thousands of security forces to forestall political protests and terrorist attacks. Pakistan granted government workers a half-day\u2019s vacation, and business in both countries came to a virtual standstill during the match. The passion also seized immigrants from both nations, and much of South Asia, where cricket is embraced with the same devotion as football is in Nebraska.\nSo while most of the New York region was still asleep, South Asians gathered in groups small and large, in private homes and public spaces, to watch and cheer.\n\u201cOne step short of a war is this cricket match,\u201d declared Amir Khan, manager of the Pakistani-owned Gourmet Sweets and Restaurant, on Broadway in Jackson Heights. The restaurant had set up large televisions on its two floors. \u201cThis is a real rumble,\u201d he said.\nMr. Khan claimed that he was not \u201ca big fan,\u201d but then \u2014 sounding like a big fan \u2014 proceeded to declaim about the sport\u2019s attractions. \u201cThis game, in itself, it\u2019s so pulling, it\u2019s so indulging!\u201d he exclaimed in English, excitedly rocking back and forth as the television showed the teams taking the field. \u201cAnd that starts from childhood, until you die.\u201d \nSeveral blocks east, the Jackson Heights Cinema was showing the game live on its big screen, for $30 a ticket. Praveen Elankumaran, 22, an Indian-born freelance film cameraman now living in the East Village, said he was going to sit through the entire match \u2014 a little over eight hours. \n\u201cIt\u2019s how we grew up,\u201d he said with a shrug, as he bought a box of Mike and Ike candy at the snack concession. \u201cIt\u2019s not long to us.\u201d \nBy match time, about 70 people \u2014 Pakistanis, Indians, Bangladeshis and Sri Lankans \u2014 had filed into the theater. Judging by the crowd\u2019s eruptions during the match, loyalties seemed to be evenly split between the two sides. Somasondaram Gunasegaram, the theater\u2019s Sri Lanka-born owner, said he did not expect any trouble among his customers, despite the history of violence between Pakistan and India. \n\u201cHealthy rivalry is fine, but nothing offensive,\u201d he said, gesturing to his customers. \u201cThey know.\u201d \nMr. Gunasegaram noted that the crowd was far smaller than he had anticipated. At Gourmet Sweets, no more than two dozen people showed up to watch, even though employees had prepared for more than 200. Business owners blamed the Internet: Many people, they surmised, had stayed home to watch online. \nBut the modest turnouts did not appear to dampen enthusiasm. The cafes and restaurants, the movie theater and even a DVD store filled with whoops and roars that carried out into the neighborhood.\nMany fans said they had come for the communal experience of witnessing an event that was about much more than sport.\n\u201cOh, my God! I think you know Pakistan and India are fighting all the time,\u201d exclaimed Bishawjit Saha, 45, a co-owner of Muktadhara Inc., a Bangladeshi bookstore on 74th Street, where several friends had joined him to drink tea and watch.\nMr. Saha said he had bought a 55-inch television especially for the event \u2014 noting mischievously that he had not sought his wife\u2019s approval. \u201cBut after the game, I\u2019m going to present it to her,\u201d he confided. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a tactic.\u201d\nThe match was a tight contest, with India beating Pakistan by 29 runs; India will face Sri Lanka in the final on Saturday in Mumbai.\n\u201cThis is cricket,\u201d said Taiyeabur Rahman, a former professional cricket player in Bangladesh. \u201cYou don\u2019t know if you die, you don\u2019t know if you live.\u201d",

    "text": "A Winning Combination\n2011-01-07T22:01:46.000Z\n AFZAL HOSSAIN, a 34-year-old artist and architect who grew up in Bangladesh, has vivid childhood memories of women making kanthas, handmade quilts constructed of layers of fabrics from worn garments and lavishly encrusted with colorful embroidery. \n \u201cWomen sometimes spend up to a year making a single quilt,\u201d said Mr. Hossain, who immigrated to New York in 1996 and now lives with his wife and family in Jackson Heights, Queens. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderfully social part of their culture because the women sit together and talk as they sew.\u201d \n Mr. Hossain considers himself fortunate to have a kantha of his own. The fluffy white coverlet that dominates the master bedroom features doll-like figures wearing traditional costumes and posed beneath canopies of flowering trees.\n And it is not the only such reminder of his homeland in the apartment that he shares with Julie Nymann, 37; the couple\u2019s 3-year-old daughter, Audra Shehnai; and Ms. Nymann\u2019s mother, Janet Nymann.\n In certain respects, Jackson Heights couldn\u2019t be more different from Bangladesh. The historic district, the heart of the community, is defined by clusters of red-brick garden apartments that date back to the early 20th century. But the neighborhood is also a magnet for families from South Asia. When Mr. Hossain came to New York with his mother and a brother, Jackson Heights was a logical destination.\n By the time Mr. Hossain graduated from Pratt Institute with a degree in architecture in 2004, he had fallen in love with Ms. Nymann, an architect from Tennessee he had met at a downtown bar frequented by young architects and designers. Once the two were engaged, they started looking for an apartment in his neighborhood. From that point on, things happened fast.\n In July 2005, the couple bought a one-bedroom on the second floor of the Arlington, a garden apartment complex on 35th Avenue, for $165,000. Two months later they were married. The following year Mr. Hossain started a design firm called Bang/Architecture and Design (the echo of the word Bangladesh was intentional). \n And as if the couple didn\u2019t already have enough going on, they also decided to open a cafe that would do double duty as an art gallery. By early 2007, as plans for the cafe moved forward, they learned they were expecting a child. \n \u201cSo we were working on two big projects at the same time,\u201d said Ms. Nymann, who has vivid and not entirely pleasant memories of helping transform a onetime Indian clothing store into a center for coffee and art while eight months pregnant.\n Their daughter was born in September 2007. Three months later the couple opened Espresso 77, a few blocks from their apartment. \n Ms. Nymann\u2019s mother came the week after the baby was born. \u201cAnd basically,\u201d her daughter said, \u201cshe never left.\u201d\n All the pieces seemed to fall into place. Ms. Nymann\u2019s father had died a decade earlier. Her mother had been living alone in the family house. Ms. Nymann, who at the time was employed by Robert A. M. Stern Architects, went back to work four months after Audra was born. Mr. Hossain was busy getting the cafe up and running.\n For some families, so many people under the same small roof would have been a recipe for disaster. For this one, it proved ideal.\n \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have opened the cafe without her,\u201d said Ms. Nymann, who is now a deputy director of architecture for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have done anything without her.\u201d \nHer husband concurs: \u201cI was the one who urged her to stay,\u201d Mr. Hossain said. \u201cTruly, we get along wonderfully.\u201d \nAlong with the benefit of an extra pair of hands, Ms. Nymann saw a less tangible but equally powerful benefit to her mother\u2019s presence.\n\u201cWhen I was growing up, my grandparents lived so far away, I really didn\u2019t get to know them,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel lucky that my daughter will know what it means to have a grandparent nearby.\u201d\n But a one-bedroom for four people was feasible only for so long. So in July 2009, when a pair of adjacent one-bedrooms became available on the building\u2019s fifth floor, the couple bought the apartments for $485,000. Last February, after the spaces were combined and reconfigured \u0097 an undertaking that cost $100,000 \u0097 the family moved in. \n Many of the furnishings came from the usual places \u0097 the living room chandelier from West Elm, the entire kitchen from the Lowe\u2019s in Brooklyn, the shelves from Ikea, the wooden bench from Two Jakes in Williamsburg, the rugs from Target. \n \u201cThe building has a rule that 80 percent of the floor has to be carpeted,\u201d Ms. Nymann said, \u201cand with a toddler, we figured that would be a good idea. So one night we just went to Target and bought a whole bunch of rugs.\u201d\n One item that has a more distinguished provenance is the teak and wool armchair made by Finn Juhl, the Danish furniture designer.\n \u201cMy parents had bought it at Neiman Marcus in Dallas in the 1960s for $500,\u201d Ms. Nymann recalled. \u201cNow it\u2019s probably worth $5,000.\u201d\n Audra\u2019s room is pale green \u0097 \u201cshe chose the color herself,\u201d he father reported proudly \u0097 and from her window she can see leafy treetops and the moon. But everyone agrees that the best view is from the elder Ms. Nymann\u2019s bedroom.\n \u201cYou can see practically to LaGuardia,\u201d her daughter said. \u201cAt night Audra and my mother sit there and watch the planes, and talk about where they\u2019re going and where they\u2019ve come from. It\u2019s so calming, it helps her fall asleep.\u201d \n Just as the colorful kantha recalls Mr. Hossain\u2019s homeland, so does his painting titled \u201cStealing Mangoes,\u201d which hangs in the dining area. The image, a swirl of blues and oranges, depicts a woman dressed in white who seems to be taking possession of an entire tree with her outstretched arms.\nThe painting was inspired by his own days of mango rustling.\n \u201cBack when I was growing up,\u201d Mr. Hossain recalled, \u201cwe used to do that at night, so no one would see us. We were always convinced that other people\u2019s mangoes were much better than ours.\u201d ",

    "text": "Migrant Workers Pile Up at Libya\u2019s Borders\n2011-03-02T08:24:15.000Z\nRAS AJDIR BORDER CROSSING, Tunisia \u0097 Tens of thousands of migrant workers fleeing Libya found themselves in a desperate crush of refugees trying to cross the border into Tunisia on Wednesday.\nAs they wait \u0097 some as long as four days \u0097 many are sleeping on dusty concrete and hard-packed dirt, shielded against the cold in blankets handed out by the Tunisian government and aid groups; others have hung the blankets from trees to create makeshift tents.\nMore than half of the estimated 180,000 people fleeing Libya in the past 10 days have sought refuge in Tunisia. Appealing for international help on Wednesday, the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said: \u201cWe need concrete action on the ground to provide humanitarian and medical assistance. Time is of the essence. Thousands of lives are at risk.\u201d\n Several aid groups were operating on the Tunisian and Egyptian borders, handing out food and supplies to the refugees and assessing the situation for providing more help.\nBut it was the Tunisian border that worried aid groups the most. \n\u201cThere is an absolutely mammoth task that is absolutely imperative\u201d to ease pressure on the border area, Sybella Wilkes, a spokeswoman for the United Nations refugee agency in Geneva, said Wednesday. \u201cThe capacity of the border area is bursting.\u201d \nBritain and France said Wednesday that they would send planes to airlift stranded Egyptians \u0097 a majority of the refugees, along with Bangladeshis, sub-Saharan Africans and others \u0097 from the Tunisian border. (Many Egyptians have headed to the Tunisian border because it is closer to Tripoli, Libya\u2019s capital, where most had worked.)\nBritain\u2019s prime minister, David Cameron, told lawmakers in London, \u201cI think it is vital to do this; these people shouldn\u2019t be kept in transit camps if it is possible to take them back to their home, and I am glad that Britain can play such an important part in doing that.\u201d \nThe French government said it would send several planes and a ship to take up to 5,000 Egyptians, and Italy said it would help set up a camp on the Tunisian border offering food and medical assistance.\nTunisian officials sought to maintain order on Wednesday, picking smaller groups to cross from among the crowds waiting at the crossing. \nAt one point, officials seemed to single out a small group of people from Guinea-Bissau, who held signs announcing their country of origin, and invited them to cross. The move appeared to upset a much larger group of migrant workers from Bangladesh, who surged around the main gate, forcing the authorities to escort the Guinea-Bissau group through a side door.\nOnce across, refugees board buses to a nearby airport \u0097 though many have limited means to buy tickets. \nOn Libya\u2019s border with Egypt, the flow of new arrivals has decreased over the past several days. But there, too, thousands of migrants remain, sleeping on floors and outdoor pavement as they wait for their embassies to approve visas and arrange for flights.\nIn the Egyptian town of Salum, international assistance began trickling in, with medical supplies and assessment teams gathering at the border checkpoint.\nTwo Red Cross trucks filled with medical supplies idled on the Egyptian side of the border, and the authorities requested that the equipment be moved from an Egyptian truck to a Libyan one before it could cross, according to Samir Hadzimustafic, a Red Cross representative there. \nA group of United Nations officials arriving at the crossing said they were headed to Benghazi, the emerging capital of rebel-controlled eastern Libya, partly to see if the port there could be turned into a full-fledged corridor for humanitarian relief. \nThe opposition\u2019s control of eastern Libya creates complications for assistance organizations because they are not being invited in by the official government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, said Abdul Haq Amiri, the head of the regional United Nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs.\n\u201cIt is a first mission, intended to determine whether there is a need for help,\u201d Mr. Amiri said. \nWith him were representatives of the World Food Program, Unicef, the World Health Organization and the United Nations refugee organization. \nOther groups heading to the area include the International Medical Corps, Mercy Corps and the Organization of the Islamic Conference.\nOn Wednesday afternoon in Salum, a medical tent set up by the Egyptian Health Ministry was empty except for Nasr Abit Abdu el-Wadid, 32, an Egyptian laborer who had fled from Misurata, a city 130 miles from Tripoli that had seen heavy fighting. Soldiers, he said, had kicked him in the head, and doctors said his severely bloodshot eyes and swollen nose were evidence of head trauma.\nHe had fled with two friends from Surt, Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s hometown. \u201cThe soldiers asked for my passport, and took my passport,\u201d he said. \u201cThey took my mobile phone. They took all of our mobile phones. They took our money.\u201d \nSix professional basketball players from sub-Saharan Africa who were playing for teams in Benghazi arrived at the border on Wednesday, saying they feared being killed by Libyans who were assuming that any black Africans they encountered were mercenaries. \n\u201cAll Africans are in trouble now, they will arrest you,\u201d said Sunny Daykins, 19, a Liberian who played for a team called Al Hillal. \u201cThey don\u2019t even give you time to speak.\u201d\nThe United Nations said Wednesday that thousands of sub-Saharan Africans might cross into poverty-stricken Niger from Libya in the coming weeks because of those fears, Reuters reported.\nIn Salum, several women waited among the crowds of men. \u201cThere are more women inside Libya, but they are afraid to come out,\u201d said Laura Seulu, 29, from Cameroon, who had been a maid for a family in Benghazi. Rebels, she said, had broken into her house, and she had left as soon as she felt there was a sufficient lull in the violence.",

    "text": "American Chefs Discover Mustard Oil\n2011-11-01T23:24:57.000Z\nLAURENCE EDELMAN is not a chef who looks often to Asia for culinary inspiration.\n\u201cI\u2019m not the kind of guy that\u2019s out there looking for the exotic,\u201d said Mr. Edelman, who opened his new-American restaurant, Left Bank, this summer in the West Village. But while making his own mustard, he found an enticing ingredient from the East, mustard oil. Mr. Edelman now serves this pungent amber oil with lightly pickled mustard seeds on a fris\u00e9e and cornichon salad with rich pig\u2019s-head terrine.\n\u201cIt\u2019s got this clang to it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that once you get that taste of it, then all of a sudden everything is lacking mustard oil.\u201d\nMustard oil\u2019s silky heat and sinus-clearing vapors will ring a bell for South Asians, particularly in the Bengal region of eastern India and Bangladesh, where it flavors fish curries and mashed vegetable bhartas. It is also used as a massage oil, the only use for which it is legally approved in the United States.\nBut more American chefs hunting for new flavors have discovered mustard oil. While Bengalis mostly use it for saut\u00e9eing, reducing its intensity, American chefs usually finish dishes with a trickle of the sharp raw oil, as Jean-Georges Vongerichten does with blanched mustard greens in his new book, \u201cHome Cooking With Jean-Georges: My Favorite Simple Recipes\u201d (Clarkson Potter).\nMustard oil is a key ingredient in the \u201cuni panini,\u201d a sandwich with a cult following at Alex Raij\u2019s Chelsea tapas bar, El Quinto Pino. Playing on the Japanese pairing of sea urchin and wasabi, Ms. Raij mixes it into butter she slathers on a ficelle and tops with sea urchin. \u201cIt has these great vapors, but it\u2019s not the kind of heat that lingers,\u201d she said. \u201cI think because it\u2019s an oil, it hits the tongue differently.\u201d\nKen Oringer said he discovered mustard oil when the Indian cookbook author Madhur Jaffrey made a guest-chef visit to his restaurant, Clio, in Boston. Now he marinates jalape\u00f1os in mustard oil for Indian-inspired pickles and poaches fish in mustard oil before searing it with Spanish paprika. \u201cThere\u2019s no ingredient that comes close to it,\u201d Mr. Oringer said. \u201cIt brings so much flavor.\u201d\nFew American chefs have featured mustard oil as prominently as Michael Hodgkins, the former chef at Hung Ry, a hand-pulled-noodle shop in Manhattan. In his time there, Mr. Hodgkins used mustard oil as his go-to seasoning in everything from a simple salad dressing for shaved apples and local greens to a fried squid dish with fennel and coriander seeds, lime and honey.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have that thick, fatty texture that coats your mouth,\u201d he said. \u201cYou taste it, and then it\u2019s gone.\u201d\nKoreans use mustard oil in a hot seasoning oil, and some Chinese cuisines employ it in cold dressings. But the most classic Bengali use is in shorshe bata, a powerful paste of mustard seeds and oil that is often used to showcase the delicacy of the shadlike migratory fish ilish. Mohammed Rahman serves it at Neerob, his Bangladeshi restaurant in the Bronx. Although many Bengalis now cook with other oils, Mr. Rahman said, traditional dishes aren\u2019t the same without the oil. \u201cBack in the days before the British, nobody used vegetable oil or corn oil,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you eat it, you feel like you\u2019re eating something.\u201d\nUntil recently, good mustard oil was so hard to find in the United States that Bengalis coming here would tuck a can into their suitcases. As the South Asian diaspora has spread, however, mustard oil imported from India, Bangladesh and Pakistan has become easy to find in specialized stores for about $5 a liter.\nAlthough they are usually found on shelves of cooking oil, not massage oil, bottles of pure mustard oil sold in the United States must bear a warning: \u201cFor external use only.\u201d Since the mid-1990s, the Food and Drug Administration has banned the import or sale of pure mustard oil as a foodstuff. Some mustard oils are 20 to 40 percent erucic acid, which studies have indicated might cause heart problems in lab rats. But a spokeswoman for the F.D.A. said that as long as bottles bear the warning, the agency doesn\u2019t regulate the oil, and can\u2019t dictate how it is displayed in stores. A spokeswoman for the New York City health department said that if restaurant inspectors saw mustard oil bearing the \u201cexternal use only\u201d label, they could discard it and issue a citation to the store for having an unapproved food, though she said she has no record of any such citation being issued.\nDespite the rules, erucic acid levels in mustard oil are not necessarily dangerous, said Walter Willet, chairman of the department of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health. \u201cThe reality is that we are not really sure,\u201d Mr. Willet wrote in an e-mail. \u201cThe potential hazards are based on animal studies, and to my knowledge we don\u2019t have real evidence of harm to humans.\u201d\nA study in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2004 found that Indians who ate mustard oil had lower incidences of heart disease, possibly because of its alpha-linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid that is found in plants.  Ramanan Laxminarayan, a research scholar at the Princeton Environmental Institute, said any benefits, like any risks, have yet to be conclusively proved. But Mr. Laxminarayan said he has no concerns about the safety of a drizzle of mustard oil.\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that at that quantity of use it could do much of anything at all,\u201d he said. \u201cJust as it would require a lot for serious health benefits, it would probably require a lot for any harm.\u201d\nSwetal Patel, a vice president at Raja Foods, an importer of the oil, said many South Asian home cooks probably ignore the warning. \u201cThey\u2019ve been using it since the day they were born,\u201d he said. Under the brand Swad, his company sells a version blended with vegetable oil that needs no warning.\nFor some chefs, the warning is a badge of authenticity. Tom Valenti, chef and owner of Ouest in Manhattan, discovered mustard oil at Kalustyan\u2019s, the international food store. He ignored blended oils without the warning. \u201cI decided to select the one that said \u2018for external use only,\u2019 figuring that was the one with the most horsepower,\u201d he recalled. He said he now uses a blended oil in his salmon gravlax on a chickpea pancake, drizzled with mustard-oil-steeped caviar. Customers love the dish, Mr. Valenti said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten a couple of, \u2018Woo, that\u2019s spicy,\u2019 with slightly watery eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s always a smile under those watery eyes.\u201d",

    "text": "Deadly Explosion Strikes Courthouse in New Delhi\n2011-09-07T07:59:40.000Z\nNEW DELHI \u2014 An explosion ripped through a reception area of an Indian courthouse on Wednesday morning, killing at least 10 people and wounding more than 60 others in a bombing that renewed concerns about India\u2019s vulnerability to terrorism. It was the second bombing of the courthouse in less than four months.\nWitnesses described a chaotic scene at the Delhi High Court after the blast at 10:14 a.m., outside a reception area used by litigants, lawyers and visitors to enter the courthouse. \n\u201cIt was in shambles,\u201d said Ajay Mehrotra, a lawyer who witnessed the explosion. \u201cThere was total chaos. There was blood. People were running for their lives.\u201d\nThe Indian home minister, Palaniappan Chidambaram, called the explosion a terrorist attack and noted that New Delhi was already in a high state of alert with Parliament in session. Mr. Chidambaram said Indian intelligence agencies had received information in July about a possible terrorist threat to the city, which had been turned over to the local police. He did not elaborate about the intelligence report. On Thursday, three people were detained for questioning by the police, Reuters reported. \n\u201cThe bomb blast took place just outside the reception center,\u201d Mr. Chidambaram said at a news conference. \u201cIt is suspected that the bomb was placed in a briefcase.\u201d\nReuters reported that a militant terrorist group called HuJI, for Harkat-ul-Jihad Islami, based largely in Pakistan, and also Bangladesh, had claimed responsibility for the attacks, citing security officials.\nPrime Minister Manmohan Singh, speaking to reporters during a visit to Bangladesh, condemned the explosion as \u201ca cowardly act of a terrorist nature.\u201d\n\u201cWe will deal with it,\u201d Mr. Singh said. \u201cWe will never succumb to the pressure of terrorism.\u201d \nIndian authorities have come under renewed criticism in recent months about their preparedness to prevent terrorism. Terrorist attacks are a persistent concern in India, particularly in the country\u2019s rapidly growing cities, which have endured a series of bombings in recent years. \nIn July, more than 20 people were killed in Mumbai, the country\u2019s financial capital, from three blasts timed to the evening rush hour. That attack raised painful memories of the bloody November 2008 attacks on Mumbai, in which militants trained in Pakistan swept through luxury hotels, a railway station and a Jewish center in a rampage that left more than 160 people dead.\nWednesday\u2019s attack at the Delhi High Court exposed anew the weaknesses in the courthouse\u2019s security. In May, a smaller bomb detonated near a parked car outside the courthouse, causing no injuries. Witnesses told local media of seeing a black bag in flames after the blast. \nRakesh Tiku, chairman of the Delhi Bar Association, criticized the Delhi police, saying \u201cthe low-intensity blast in May should have served as an eye-opener.\u201d Mr. Tiku said hundreds of litigants and clerks passed through the gate where the blast took place each day, making it a vulnerable location. \u201cThe Delhi High Court requested the Delhi police to install CCTV cameras as well as personnel to man the entrances three or four months ago, but no action has been taken,\u201d he said. \nThe latest explosion occurred near Gate 5 of the High Court, outside a reception center where visitors wait for passes to enter the building. Lawyers said Wednesday was an especially busy day because the court heard public-interest litigation.\n\u201cWhat are the police doing?\u201d asked Mr. Mehrotra, the lawyer. \u201cThe lives of lawyers, litigants and judges are at stake.\u201d\nAnother witness, Brijmohan Sharma, described a \u201cvery loud sound, the reverberations from which caused me to lose my balance. I got up and was surrounded by people running.\u201d He added: \u201cIt was like a scene from a film. People were lying on the floor with their hands cut off, their legs broken and bleeding.\u201d\nThe last serious attacks in New Delhi took place in 2008, when coordinated blasts in a park and in shopping areas killed more than 20 people and injured nearly 100. In those attacks, the Indian Mujahedeen, an Islamic militant group, claimed responsibility. \nThe Delhi High Court is in the heart of the capital, a short walk from the city\u2019s landmark India Gate. Rahul Gupta, a local resident, said he was standing near the courthouse entrance when the ground shook from the blast, throwing people onto the road outside the reception area. \n\u201cSecurity is one area which no one can handle in Delhi at the moment,\u201d Mr. Gupta said. \u201cIt is the fanatical people who are creating these types of problems and trying to create panic in the public.\u201d\nMr. Chidambaram, the home minister, said many of the people taken to local hospitals had suffered severe injuries. Many had lost limbs, witnesses reported. \nThe Indian government said that a preliminary analysis found a nitrate-based explosive with traces of pentaerythritol tetranitrate, or PETN, a powerful plastic explosive often used in terror plots.\n\u201cDelhi is a target of terrorist groups,\u201d Mr. Chidambaram said. \u201cGovernment unequivocally condemns the attack that took place today.\u201d",

    "text": "Little to Show for Strong Work Ethic and a Degree\n2011-12-19T05:04:55.000Z\nAbdulla Chowdhury was telling the story of how he took his young daughter shopping recently for a winter coat, and the memory was enough to make him bury his head in his hands. In his wallet had been a $20 bill. On the coat rack, many options sure to please his daughter. But the cheapest coat cost $50. So the money stayed in his pocket and the coat remained on the rack. The moment crystallized one of Mr. Chowdhury\u2019s worst fears: his inability to provide for his two children the way his parents had provided for him. \n\u201cI was raised without any worry,\u201d said Mr. Chowdhury, 43, who grew up in Bangladesh. \u201cEverything was there for me.\u201d But since 2009, he has been struggling to care for his family.\nWhen Mr. Chowdhury came to the United States in 1997, he had a bachelor\u2019s degree in accounting and six years of employment experience, along with a towering work ethic and lots of optimism. He settled first in Hyattsville, Md., and went job-hunting. But he said he was told that his degree was useless in America; his Bangladeshi education simply did not translate. \n\u201cNobody could see my value,\u201d Mr. Chowdhury said.\nDespite the setbacks, he sought work in the fast-food business; he had known it was a career possibility even before he left his home country. He was hired as a cashier at KFC, and after about 10 months, his supervisor promoted him to assistant unit manager. Mr. Chowdhury said he continued looking for an accounting job, but to no avail. \nThen, in 1999, he began experiencing a burning pain in his eyes, and his vision became increasingly blurry. Mr. Chowdhury said he thought it was related to stress. But after seeing a few specialists, he was told he had Stargardt\u2019s macular dystrophy, a genetic disorder that would slowly rob him of his vision.\nThough devastated, Mr. Chowdhury kept on working even as his sight grew worse. In 2001, he transferred to a KFC in Jamaica, Queens. But his impaired vision eventually led him to cut his work hours and to take a position as a cook.\nFumes from the stoves and the kitchen machinery worsened his condition, Mr. Chowdhury said. Once, he accidentally placed his right hand into a vat of frying oil heated to 380 degrees. He had been burned on the job before, but this was by far the worst accident, and he knew then that he had to find another line of work. \nWith a degree rendered useless by country borders, and with one of his five senses failing him, Mr. Chowdhury said, his options were limited. At a friend\u2019s suggestion, he decided to seek employment as a security guard. During interviews, he would produce a small magnifying glass from his pocket to help him fill out applications. But the special lens might have put him on employers\u2019 blacklists, he said.\n\u201cWhenever they saw it,\u201d he said, \u201cthey all said the same thing: \u2018Thank you. We\u2019ll call you back.\u2019\u00a0\u201d \nBut Mr. Chowdhury\u2019s phone never rang. Eventually, he learned to hide his statutory blindness, and in 2005, he landed a security job that required him only to verify that staff members slid their identification cards through a sensor correctly. \nThe job went well until 2009, when he and 86 other employees were laid off. He has been looking for work ever since. \nMr. Chowdhury lives in a one-bedroom attic apartment in Woodhaven, Queens, with his wife, Marjahan, 35, whom he married in 2007, and their two children, Fatiha, 3, and Zikra, who turns 6 months this week. \nHis wife, who speaks very little English and has a master\u2019s degree in Bangladesh, has not been able to find work, either. Mr. Chowdhury receives $1,070 in Social Security disability benefits, $465 a month in food stamps and nine cans of Enfamil formula each month from the Women, Infants and Children program. \nHaving to walk away from the child\u2019s coat he could not afford drove him to contact Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, and in November, he received $300 from the fund to buy his children coats and clothes.\nMr. Chowdhury said he had also spoken with his caseworker at Catholic Charities\u2019 Guild for the Blind about the possibility of getting help to pay for classes so he could pursue an accounting degree in America. The charity is also helping him look for other work in the meantime. \n\u201cFinancially, I am weak,\u201d Mr. Chowdhury said. It was a painful admission for him. \u201cI need a part-time job; I still feel like I am capable to work.\n\u201cI hate sitting at home and feeling like a bum.\u201d ",

    "text": "In Libyan Port, Stranded Migrants Watch Hope Depart\n2011-02-27T02:26:42.000Z\nBENGHAZI, Libya \u0097 American and British citizens have been evacuating for days. The Chinese workers were on their way, and the Bosnians stood ready with their bags on the shore. But from the milky windows of stifling rooms in a makeshift camp, the migrant workers from other, poorer countries, stranded by war and, in some cases, forsaken by their employers, watched cruise ships \u0097 and salvation \u0097 depart.\n Many of the workers \u0097 from Vietnam and Thailand, Bangladesh and Ghana \u0097 worked for Turkish construction companies that had projects under way worth billions of dollars in Libya. The workers said that the Turkish managers of some of those companies quickly left Libya, sometimes without returning the workers\u2019 passports. In other cases, though, the companies seemed to be actively trying to help. \n But there seemed to be little assistance available for black African workers, including many from Ghana, Nigeria, Mali and Burkina Faso. Libya has become a dangerous place to be a black man, after Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi used African mercenaries to kill opponents of his government. Now the workers, some of whom have seen colleagues killed, are kept under armed guard and moved from place to place because residents have objected to their presence. \n \u201cThe Ghanaian ambassador said he didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d said Idris Shebany, one of several Libyan volunteers running the camp. \u201cLet them stay here.\u201d \n On Saturday, in the rain under a loading crane on a dock next to a Greek cruise ship, a group of Nigerians watched luckier workers make their way up a gangway. The Nigerians said they were told that they could not board the ship. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that a boat is coming for us,\u201d said Ali Uchichi, 27.\nSome said they had heard a rumor that a plane was waiting for them in Tripoli, but, of course, there was no way for them to reach the capital. Furthermore, they were not sure whether the rumor was true. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to die here,\u201d Mr. Uchichi said.\n There are as many as 1.5 million migrants working in Libya, according to the International Organization for Migration, an intergovernmental group. Since the uprising that started in this city, hundreds of thousands of people trying to escape the violence have streamed toward the borders with Egypt or Tunisia, or departed on chartered planes and ferries sent from their home countries. \nWith parts of Libya locked in armed struggle, Benghazi \u0097 its faded colonial buildings brightened by antigovernment graffiti \u0097 lurches between euphoria and apprehension. At the courthouse nearby, a fledgling authority is taking over the functions of the government and helping to plan a military response to Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s brutal suppression of the uprising. Many people in this center of resistance to the colonel\u2019s rule made rosy predictions that the leader would be gone by now. But, through violence, he has held power.\nSo with blankets wrapped in zippered plastic bags and whatever documents they can muster, the migrants flee.\nAlmost 20,000 workers have cycled through a camp here, in Benghazi\u2019s port, living in trailers that were apparently used by a company rehabilitating the port. They were met by members of this city\u2019s thriving volunteer corps \u0097 men and women working to defy Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s assertion that the uprising would lead to certain chaos. \nA man who sells women\u2019s clothes carries a machine gun and patrols the camp. Other businessmen register the workers, stock the kitchen or outfit a hospital. Juice, dates and biscuits have been donated by residents, some of whom have lent their kitchens to the effort. \n\n12 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nEven so, the conditions are harsh. On thin mattresses, the men sleep 10 or more to a tiny room, and, for all of the donations, there is not enough food. \u201cI am now very hungry,\u201d said Nguyen Van Thuoun, 22, a laborer. \u201cThere is not enough rice.\u201d Trash was piled high outside a trailer where Indian employees of Hyundai had stayed. \nMany workers traveled hundreds of miles to get to the camp. Pakistani and Bangladeshi pipeline workers came on buses from deep in Libya\u2019s southern desert. Chinese workers drove their dump trucks right to the Benghazi port, left the keys in the ignition (or forgot them) and got on the boats. Ghanaians who worked in Benghazi came because they no longer felt safe in the city. \nAbubakar Ummar, a 29-year-old Ghanaian plasterer who worked at a Turkish construction company, said that men with machetes had recently attacked the building where he was living with other workers. \u201cThey came to us at midnight,\u201d Mr. Ummar said. One of the workers, a young man about 25 years old, was killed instantly, he said, adding that another had died of his wounds the next day. \nHis company\u2019s managers, who, according to Mr. Ummar, had not paid their workers in several weeks, were no help. \u201cThey gave us our passports and our ID\u2019s and let us mind our lives,\u201d he said. \nMr. Ummar stood in line with hundreds of other African migrants at a school where volunteers registered them, while men with sunglasses and machine guns stood watch outside. The organizers said that later on Saturday the migrants would be moved to a stadium because local residents had complained that the situation was making the neighborhood unsafe.\n Like the volunteers, some of the workers have assumed new roles. Mansoor K. Warraich, a quality assurance manager for a Turkish company that helped build a Libyan water pipeline, now helps organize about 600 stranded workers. All of the company\u2019s Turkish managers and workers, except one, were able to leave the country several days ago. The workers that remain include many from Pakistan and Bangladesh. \nThey said they left their camps along the pipeline after they were raided by bandits. \n\u201cWe want to know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Mr. Warraich. \u201cI believe there is a plan, but we don\u2019t know about the plan.\u201d ",

    "text": "Rush to Use Crops as Fuel Raises Food Prices and Hunger Fears\n2011-04-07T01:03:08.000Z\nThe starchy cassava root has long been an important ingredient in everything from tapioca pudding and ice cream to paper and animal feed. \nBut last year, 98 percent of cassava chips exported from Thailand, the world\u2019s largest cassava exporter, went to just one place and almost all for one purpose: to China to make biofuel. Driven by new demand, Thai exports of cassava chips have increased nearly fourfold since 2008, and the price of cassava has roughly doubled. \nEach year, an ever larger portion of the world\u2019s crops \u2014 cassava and corn, sugar and palm oil \u2014 is being diverted for biofuels as developed countries pass laws mandating greater use of nonfossil fuels and as emerging powerhouses like China seek new sources of energy to keep their cars and industries running. Cassava is a relatively new entrant in the biofuel stream.\nBut with food prices rising sharply in recent months, many experts are calling on countries to scale back their headlong rush into green fuel development, arguing that the combination of ambitious biofuel targets and mediocre harvests of some crucial crops is contributing to high prices, hunger and political instability. \nThis year, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization reported that its index of food prices was the highest in its more than 20 years of existence. Prices rose 15 percent from October to January alone, potentially \u201cthrowing an additional 44 million people in low- and middle-income countries into poverty,\u201d the World Bank said.\nSoaring food prices have caused riots or contributed to political turmoil in a host of poor countries in recent months, including Algeria, Egypt and Bangladesh, where palm oil, a common biofuel ingredient, provides crucial nutrition to a desperately poor populace. During the second half of 2010, the price of corn rose steeply \u2014 73 percent in the United States \u2014 an increase that the United Nations World Food Program attributed in part to the greater use of American corn for bioethanol.\n\u201cThe fact that cassava is being used for biofuel in China, rapeseed is being used in Europe, and sugar cane elsewhere is definitely creating a shift in demand curves,\u201d said Timothy D. Searchinger, a research scholar at Princeton University who studies the topic. \u201cBiofuels are contributing to higher prices and tighter markets.\u201d \nIn the United States, Congress has mandated that biofuel use must reach 36 billion gallons annually by 2022. The European Union stipulates that 10 percent of transportation fuel must come from renewable sources like biofuel or wind power by 2020. Countries like China, India, Indonesia and Thailand have adopted biofuel targets as well.\nTo be sure, many factors help drive up the price of food, including bad weather that ruins crop yields and high oil prices that make transportation costly. Last year, for example, unusually severe weather destroyed wheat harvests in Russia, Australia and China, and an infestation of the mealy bug reduced Thailand\u2019s cassava output. \nOlivier Dubois, a bioenergy expert at the Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome, said it was hard to quantify the extent to which the diversions for biofuels had driven up food prices. \n\u201cThe problem is complex, so it is hard to come up with sweeping statements like biofuels are good or bad,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what is certain is that biofuels are playing a role. Is it 20 or 30 or 40 percent? That depends on your modeling.\u201d \nWhile no one is suggesting that countries abandon biofuels, Mr. Dubois and other food experts suggest that they should revise their policies so that rigid fuel mandates can be suspended when food stocks get low or prices become too high. \n\u201cThe policy really has to be food first,\u201d said Hans Timmer, director of the Development Prospects Group of the World Bank. \u201cThe problems occur when you set targets for biofuels irrespective of the prices of other commodities.\u201d \nMr. Timmer said that the recent rise in oil prices was likely to increase the demand for biofuels. \nIt can be tricky predicting how new demand from the biofuel sector will affect the supply and price of food. Sometimes, as with corn or cassava, direct competition between purchasers drives up the prices of biofuel ingredients. In other instances, shortages and price inflation occur because farmers who formerly grew crops like vegetables for consumption plant different crops that can be used for fuel.\nChina learned this the hard way nearly a decade ago when it set out to make bioethanol from corn, only to discover that the plan caused alarming shortages and a rise in food prices. In 2007 the government banned the use of grains to make biofuel. \nChinese scientists then perfected the process of making fuel from cassava, a root that yielded good energy returns, leading to the opening of the first commercial cassava ethanol plant several years ago. \n\u201cThey\u2019re moving very aggressively in this new direction; cassava seems to be the go-to crop,\u201d said Greg Harris, an analyst with Commodore Research and Consultancy in New York who has studied the trade. \nIn addition to expanding cassava cultivation at home, China is buying from Cambodia and Laos as well as Thailand. \nAlthough a mainstay of diets in much of Africa, cassava is not central to Asian diets, even though the Chinese once called it \u201cthe underground food store\u201d because it provided crucial backup nutrition in lean harvest years. So the Chinese reasoned that making fuel with cassava would not directly affect food prices or create food shortages, at least at home. The proportion of Chinese cassava going to ethanol leapt to 52 percent last year from 10 percent in 2008.\nMore distant or indirect impacts are considered to be likely, however. Because cassava chips have been commonly used as animal feed, new demand from the biofuels industry might affect the availability and cost of meat. In Southeast Asian countries where China is paying generously for stockpiles of cassava, farmers may be tempted to grow the crop instead of, for example, other vegetables or rice. \nAnd if China turned to Africa as a source, one of that continent\u2019s staple food crops could be in jeopardy, although experts note that exporting cassava could also become a business opportunity. \n\u201cThis is becoming a more valuable cash crop,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cThe farmland is limited, so the more that is devoted to fuel, the less is devoted to food.\u201d \nThe Chinese demand for cassava could also dent planned biofuel production in poorer Asian nations: in the Philippines and Cambodia, developers were recently forced to suspend the construction of cassava bioethanol plants because the tuber had become too expensive. \nThailand\u2019s own nascent biofuel industry may have trouble getting the homegrown cassava it needs because it may not be able to match the prices offered by Chinese buyers, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization.\nBiofuels development in wealthier nations has already proved to have a powerful effect on the prices and the cultivation of crops. Encouraged by national biofuel subsidies, nearly 40 percent of the corn grown in the United States now goes to make fuel, with prices of corn on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange rising 73 percent from June to December 2010. \nSuch price rises also have distant ripple effects, food security experts say. \u201cHow much does the price of corn in Chicago influence the price of corn in Rwanda? It turns out there is a correlation,\u201d said Marie Brill, senior policy analyst at ActionAid, an international development group. The price of corn in Rwanda rose 19 percent last year.\n\u201cFor Americans it may mean a few extra cents for a box of cereal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that kind of increase puts corn out of the range of impoverished people.\u201d \nHigher prices also mean that groups like the World Food Program can buy less food to feed the world\u2019s hungry.\nEuropean biofuels developers are buying large tracts of what they call \u201cmarginal land\u201d in Africa with the aim of cultivating biofuel crops, particularly the woody bush known as jatropha. Advocates say that promoting jatropha for biofuels production has little impact on food supplies. But some of that land is used by poor people for subsistence farming or for gathering food like wild nuts. \n\u201cWe have to move away from the thinking that producing an energy crop doesn\u2019t compete with food,\u201d said Mr. Dubois of the Food and Agriculture Organization. \u201cIt almost inevitably does.\u201d ",

    "text": "The Trials of Team Afghanistan\n2011-07-29T00:33:08.000Z\nAfghanistan has a national men\u2019s basketball team, although it is made up of young Afghan-Americans with modest doses of collegiate experience. The team has a coach, although actually holding a full practice can require a mad scramble that includes cross-country flights. When the practices do occur, he sometimes puts up as many as seven players in his home near Sacramento.\n\u201cThe difficult part is the sacrifices you have to make playing on a team that has no real structure or funds,\u201d said Nafi Mashriqi, 32, the team captain, who was born in Kandahar and now lives in Queens.\nThe team, though, does have a major victory to its credit: a gold medal won last year in the South Asian Games, the only international title by Afghanistan in any team sport. But perhaps not surprisingly for a club short on history and money, the optimism born of that victory has been imperiled by issues of logistics and organization.\nThe Afghans, hoping to qualify for the London Olympics next summer, were set to play in a prequalifying tournament in Uzbekistan this weekend. But the Afghanistan Olympic Committee declined to allocate $70,000 for travel, food and accommodations. Last-ditch negotiations restored about $30,000 for travel with a smaller party. But now the players have been unable to obtain the required visas, and by Thursday night their coach, Mamo Rafiq, was convinced they would never make it to the tournament. He said he had heard through the Afghan Sports Federation, a nonprofit agency based in Virginia that serves as a liaison for athletes, that the Uzbekistan Embassy had not received the required paperwork from the country\u2019s foreign ministry to grant permission. \nThe problems have led to confusion and uncertainty. The Afghan Embassy in Washington has pitched in to try to help. It is believed that the organizers in Navoi, Uzbekistan, have considered delaying the start of tournament.\nRafiq, with a mix of candor and mystery, said this week: \u201cI had to cut two players off my roster, and I had to cut my manager. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on behind the scenes.\u201d\nIt has all taken some of the shine off the team\u2019s historic success at the South Asia Games in Bangladesh. There, Afghanistan opened with its first victory over Pakistan in 40 years.\n\u00a0\u201cNo one knew if we were even capable of winning,\u201d said Mashriqi, a 6-foot-7 center. \u201cBut once we won that game, the word got out.\u201d\nAli Noorzad, a team member who works at his father\u2019s car dealership in Virginia, recalled that Afghans competing in other sports cheered them on.\n\u201cIt was so patriotic,\u201d he said, \u201cand so inspiring that it almost brought some guys to tears.\u201d\nAfghanistan went 3-0 in the tournament, routing Nepal in the semifinals and beating heavily favored India on a late basket by Mashriqi.\n\u201cOnce the clock expired, everyone rushed the floor,\u201d Noorzad said. \u201cIt was truly an inspiring moment.\u201d\nThis weekend\u2019s Middle Asia Zone qualifier \u2014 conducted by the International Basketball Federation \u2014 involves two other national teams. The Afghans are scheduled to take on Turkmenistan on Saturday in their first game. The team that wins the tournament \u2014 and Afghanistan is the favorite \u2014 will earn a spot in the Asian championship in China next month. The championship will produce the continent\u2019s lone entrant in the 2012 Olympics.\nHow Afghanistan saw its national basketball team reconstituted is not a widely known story.\nAfter an absence of 10 years, Afghanistan re-entered international basketball in 2006, when the Olympic committee decided to field a team for that year\u2019s Asian Games. In 2007, the committee hired Rafiq, who had played for Idaho State and at the University of California, Davis. He was the first Afghan immigrant to play in the N.C.A.A.\nWith civil instability and devastated infrastructure making training in Afghanistan impossible, the hiring of Rafiq reflected a plan to rebuild Afghan basketball by reaching out to expatriates in the United States through the Afghan Sports Federation. \nSome of the players who responded had competed at small colleges. The vast majority played in recreational leagues. All were first-generation Afghan-Americans and thus eligible to represent Afghanistan.\nRafiq, Mashriqi said, immediately improved communication, and that made organizing a team possible. But it did not make day-to-day training any easier. Almost all the players had day jobs. They were scattered across the country. Their early play appears to have been financed chiefly with their own money, or family money.\n\u201cEverybody was going their own separate way,\u201d Mashriqi said of the team members before they were a team. \u201cWith Coach Mamo, you have a person who understands the game. You have a system. In that system, everybody understands his role.\u201d\nAnd so practices are held when and where they can be.\n\u201cBecause of budget and finances, I\u2019ve had to go to different locations,\u201d said Rafiq, who reserved fitness centers and high school gyms for practices and traveled across the United States to work with as few as three or four players.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had smaller training camps in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Virginia,\u201d he added. \u201cWherever they\u2019re closest, that\u2019s where they come and work out.\u201d\nMashriqi said that he has sometimes left New York on Friday to fly to California for Saturday and Sunday practices, only to return on Monday in time for work at Time Warner Cable.\nIf players cannot find or afford accommodations, Rafiq opens his home.\n\u00a0\u201cWe don\u2019t mind sleeping on the floor,\u201d Noorzad said. \u201cWe know the only way we\u2019re going to prevail is by our own camaraderie.\u201d\nEnhancing that focus is a keen sense of cultural identity.\n\u201cGuys were born in Fremont, San Diego and Chicago, but they\u2019ve all been brought up with the same upbringing,\u201d Rafiq said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been brought up as Afghans and they hold on to all those cultural values.\u201d\nYet when the players, many of them sons of refugees from the 1979 Soviet invasion, arrived in Bangladesh for last year\u2019s South Asian Games, they risked being viewed as interlopers by other Afghan athletes.\n\u201cThere was a level of discomfort on both sides, I think,\u201d Mashriqi said. \u201cI personally didn\u2019t know how they would react toward us. Once we really had a chance to sit and talk to everyone, that discomfort was completely gone.\n\u201cEveryone began to realize that even though we are not living in Afghanistan, we were just like any other Afghan.\u201d\nAnd there have been trips to tournaments, ones without visa or money problems.\nAfghanistan qualified for November\u2019s Asian Games in Guangzhou, China. The Olympic committee paid for round-trip travel. The sports federation contributed about $25,000, according to Atiq Panjshiri, its executive director.\nAfghanistan lost its only game \u2014 a qualifier against India \u2014 but the defeat did not diminish the experience.\n\u201cThe atmosphere was amazing,\u201d Rafiq said. \u201cIt was compared to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, so that in itself explains how fabulous it was. Afghanistan was the first delegation to enter the stadium to a roaring crowd due to alphabetical order.\u201d\nBut Thursday night, even with the financial uncertainty resolved, it seemed unlikely that the team would receive the documents necessary for travel to Uzbekistan.\nBut if the team\u2019s Olympic chances, no matter how slim, are derailed anywhere but on the court, its previous basketball success will be small consolation. \n\u201cWe have sacrificed so much with no real benefit,\u201d Mashriqi said, \u201cwith the exception of pride and honor.\u201d",

    "text": "Despite Its Turmoil, Syria Still Looks Like an Oasis to Iraqis\n2011-07-28T23:33:38.000Z\nBAGHDAD \u2014 At a roadside station here, where buses bound for Syria leave dozens of times a week, the space between two troubled nations is measured by notions of prosperity and security.\n\u201cHere it is very hot and Ramadan is coming,\u201d said Majid Shamis, a middle-aged Iraqi who was headed with his wife and two children, ages 4 and 5, for a two-month summer vacation in Syria. \u201cElectricity is better there. Even the security situation is better.\u201d\nPeople around the world read daily headlines about violence and unrest in Syria, where the government has undertaken a brutal crackdown on its people in response to the latest popular challenge to its power. But in Iraq, Syria still represents something of an oasis. Iraqis began to flee there years ago to escape the American-led war and the sectarian bloodletting that followed. During the war, Syria has taken in nearly 300,000 Iraqi refugees \u2014 more than any country in the region, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. \nNow, even as Syria faces its own turmoil, few Iraqis are returning home. In fact, the number of Iraqis leaving for Syria is far greater than the number coming back, said Brian C. Vaughan, assistant representative at the United Nations office. When balanced against Iraq\u2019s continuing violence, its sporadic electricity that will only get less reliable as summer creeps on and an economy dominated by a corrupt public sector, Syria is seen as a better place to live.\n\u201cYou can relax there,\u201d said Ali Mohammed, a barber, who left the Iraqi city of Najaf for Syria in 2005 after he was threatened again and again for cutting hair in a style that offended the version of Islam adhered to by the Mahdi Army, the militia that answers to the militant cleric Moktada al-Sadr.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about electricity, the heat\u201d in Syria, Mr. Mohammed, wearing a skintight T-shirt and wraparound sunglasses, explained as he prepared to return to his adopted country after a visit with his family in Iraq. \nHis friend Yasir Rashid, 21, was going along for a vacation. \u201cLife is beautiful there, women are beautiful there,\u201d Mr. Rashid said. \u201cThat is the important thing. Freedom and security, everything.\u201d\nFour or five buses leave each day for Syria from this station. A ticket costs about $25, and business seems to be booming. \u201cThe number of people leaving Iraq for Syria has increased because of the summer holiday,\u201d said a bus company manager, Abu Muhammad. \u201cFamilies are going there to escape the summer heat, and for tourism.\u201d \nBus drivers complain that the Syrian border guards often demand bribes, usually cash or gasoline, but they say that the political upheaval has not hampered business. \n\u201cIt\u2019s stable, very normal,\u201d said Farras Ali, a driver who makes the trip to Syria three times a week. \u201cThe media is making it look larger than it is.\u201d\nOf course, many Iraqis traveling from Baghdad go straight to Damascus, the capital, not to regions north of Damascus that are the sites of many protests and the violent crackdown that has left nearly 1,500 people dead.\nBut if prosperity and quality of life are measured in relative terms, that could explain why migrant workers from Bangladesh handle the luggage at the bus station here \u2014 searching for bombs before loading the bags into cargo holds \u2014 and serve chai to visitors. They came to Iraq, of all places, to seek a better life. One of them, Mamun Kalegagus, 25, said he had been working at the station, and living at its rudimentary quarters for immigrant workers, for two years. He is paid $12 to $15 a day, more than the $100 a month he earned cooking Chinese food back home.\n\u201cIt\u2019s better here,\u201d he said, but far from perfect. \u201cIn Bangladesh there is no boom,\u201d he added, referring to the still-frequent explosions heard in many Baghdad neighborhoods.\nThe relationship between Syria and Iraq has had a winding history. After World War I, Syria came under France\u2019s colonial empire, while the British gained dominion over Iraq. The two countries later established rival Baathist governments, and during the Persian Gulf war of 1991, Syria supported the coalition that drove Saddam Hussein\u2019s forces out of Kuwait.\nEarlier in the current war, Iraq accused Syria of being a source of, or a transit point for, extremists traveling here to become suicide bombers. Syria\u2019s decision to provide a haven for former members of Mr. Hussein\u2019s Baath Party also inflamed tensions between the countries. \nBut as violence has ebbed in Iraq, so has the number of foreign fighters arriving from Syria, which has allowed tensions to ease. Now, with Syria\u2019s leadership threatened by mass protests, Iraq has reached out, serving as host to delegations of Syrian business owners. Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq has called publicly for closer ties between the countries.\nFor Iraqis, Syria\u2019s attraction is a measure of the continuing fragility of their own country. \n\u201cFor me Syria is better,\u201d said Hussain Ridah, 20, as he left for Syria to visit his father and brother, who are there for medical treatment. \u201cThey say it\u2019s bad on TV, but when I call my family they say it\u2019s O.K.\u201d\nAs Iraqis experience their own slow struggle for democracy and witness similar ones in Syria and other countries across the region, some have been inspired to nourish their own protest movement. Nearly every Friday, groups of demonstrators gather in Baghdad\u2019s Tahrir Square. \nOther Iraqis, though, especially those travelers here at the bus station, are fatigued from their country\u2019s years of war and failed promises of democracy. \nMr. Mohammed, the barber from Najaf, said of the Arab uprisings: \u201cI don\u2019t care about what\u2019s happening.

    "text": "A Safe Place After Horror in Libya\n2011-04-05T13:10:10.000Z\nRA'S AJDIR, TUNISIA \u2014 To hear the mothers and daughters fleeing Libya tell it, the woman who burst into a hotel used by journalists in Tripoli saying she had been raped by the forces of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi has plenty of company. \nMore than 200,000 people have poured across this border post with Libya since unrest erupted there in February. At first, it was mainly Egyptians and Bangladeshi laborers fleeing war. In the last three weeks, the number of families from sub-Saharan countries \u2014 the women generally maids or nannies, their husbands in construction or retail \u2014 has increased markedly, as have the tales of woe. \nMore than 8,000 people now live in Camp Choucha, near the border. At the beginning, the overwhelming majority were middle aged men on their own, but now the numbers of women are increasing, said Firas Kayal, public information officer for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Separate places are designated for families and women alone in the camp, currently about 10 percent of the inhabitants, said Mr. Kayal.\nNasra Said Mahmoud, a Somali who had been working in Libya for two years, said she, her husband and their 18-year-old daughter hid day and night in their home on the outskirts of Zawiyah about 100 kilometers, or 70 miles, from the border, while battle raged between Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s supporters and rebels. \nLacking food, they eventually fled, and they were overwhelmed by the friendly welcome. \u201cMost of the Libyan people have treated us as third-class humans, so we weren\u2019t sure what to expect from the Tunisians,\u201d she said. \nHer daughter, Hawa, said that Libyan men harassed them sexually. \u201cA group of Libyan men were putting their hand between their legs,\u201d she said, \u201cand they said \u2018Come here and do the job.\u201d\u2019\nHer eyes filled with tears, and her hands shook. \u201cI heard from some women that they were raped, but it did not happen to me. We came out of hell,\u201d she said. \nSeveral Tunisian women, among them students and therapists, have come to the border to help the refugees. \nDorsaf Hmidi, 23, a student, said simply: \u201cYou can see in their faces that they have been through a lot, and we want to show them our solidarity.\u201d \nWhen women break down in front of her, she said, she steers them toward psychiatrists like Asma, 28, who asked that her last name and her organization be withheld because she was still planning future trips to Libya. \nAsma\u2019s tent, hung with large blue silk to divide it into consultation areas, is the first station to offer help for the traumatized. \n\u201cMany awful things were discussed here,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. Children saw their parents beaten, she said, or men pillaging family belongings. \nLike other volunteers, Asma participated in the protests against the Tunisian regime that ignited revolt across the Arab world. She said she felt obliged to help those fleeing Libya, where, she said, the brutality of Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s regime had made things different from Tunisia. \n\u201cWomen told us that they were raped,\u201d she said, then paused. \u201cBangladeshis, Egyptians, Somalis and Tunisians.\u201d \nShe told of a Tunisian husband who brought his wife to her. The woman broke down, Asma said, sobbing that several men had raped her in front of her husband, as they traveled from Zawiyah to the border. Some wore uniforms, \u201cbut they were not sure if they were Qaddafi\u2019s people or rebels, because everyone wears uniforms there now.\u201d \nMost women crossing the border still fear the long arm of the Libyan intelligence service and seem afraid to talk. \u201c100, 100,\u201d meaning all is 100 percent good, most mutter in a scared voice in Arabic. \nIn some cases when people were willing to talk to a reporter, men in plain clothes went up to them, whispered in their ears, and the women rushed away. The same men also tried to film or photograph journalists as well. Asked why, they answered only: \u201cJust a souvenir for us.\u201d\nAfter their first interview in the tent, Mrs. Mahmoud and her daughter were bused to Camp Choucha, seven kilometers away, for therapy. \nAt the camp, the United Nations, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and therapists from Tunisia and Morocco, which set up a field hospital, work together to alleviate the anguish of the refugees. \nRim Ben Ismail, 46, a therapist who was for years a finance professor at the University of Tunis before retraining, is one of them. \n\u201cMost of the stories are very difficult,\u201d Mrs. Ben Ismail said. \u201cSome of these people have escaped to Libya from wars in their country, like the Somalis, Sudanese, Eritreans or Nigerians, and now again they found themselves in a difficult situation.\u201d \nWhen Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s troops started going after protesters and rebels, immigrants and their families got caught in the middle. Supporters of the government started to force foreign men to fight with them, and those who refused were either suspected to be with the rebels or with Al Qaeda, seven women said in independent interviews. \nWomen from Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria and Congo also said, however, that some rebels suspected their male relatives of being pro-Qaddafi mercenaries and beat them. \n\u201cLibya is not safe for people like us right now; everyone is using us as the scapegoat,\u201d Zamzam Yousuf, a 24-year-old from Sudan, said in broken Arabic. \nMrs. Ben Ismail said that while some women got expert treatment in the field hospital, she encouraged others to avoid recalling their Libyan experiences. \u201cWe want them for now to forget about the past and realize that they are safe.\u201d \n\u201cI am here as a woman to help other women but also because I feel responsible for what is happening,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen were raped, and many people are dying and suffering, and we in Tunisia started it.\u201d ",

    "text": "Money Troubles Take Personal Toll in Greece\n2011-05-16T01:15:41.000Z\nATHENS \u2014 His face contorted with anguish, Anargyros D. recounted how he had lost everything in the aftermath of the Greek economic collapse \u2014 the food-processing factory founded by his father 30 years ago, his house, his car, his Rolex, his pride and now, he said, his will to live. \n\u201cMany times I have thought of taking my father\u2019s car and driving it into a wall,\u201d he said, declining to give his last name because he was reluctant to draw attention to himself under these circumstances. \nHunched over and shaking, he sat last week in the spartan office of Klimaka, a social services organization here that provides help to the swelling numbers of homeless and depressed Greek professionals who have lost their jobs and their dignity.\n\u201cWe were the people in Greece who helped others,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we are asking for help.\u201d \nIt has been one year since Greece avoided bankruptcy when Europe and the International Monetary Fund provided a 110 billion euro ($155 billion) bailout. While no one expected the country to reverse its sagging fortunes quickly, the despair of Greeks like Anargyros D. reflects a level of suffering deeper than anyone here had anticipated.\nEconomists are predicting a 4 percent contraction in gross domestic product this year, and the data support the pessimism. Cement production is down 60 percent since 2006. Steel production has fallen, in some cases more than 80 percent in the last two years. Analysts say that close to 250,000 private sector jobs will have been lost by the end of the year, pushing the unemployment rate above 15 percent.\nWith headlines shouting of credit rating downgrades, panicky Greeks are taking their money from banks. Greece lost 40 billion euros of deposits last year, and bankers say withdrawals have increased recently.\nThese struggles have again made Greece an urgent matter for the 17-nation euro zone, whose finance ministers are to meet on Monday to discuss Greece and the debt crisis that has defied Europe\u2019s yearlong efforts to contain it. On the table will be whether Greece, which is now projected to miss its deficit target by as much as two percentage points of G.D.P. this year, will be granted another round of loans totaling as much as 60 billion euros, and what further budget cuts would be required in return. \nBut there is serious debate about whether this kind of prescription \u2014 subjecting Greece to more cuts and sacrifice in order to justify a second installment of funds from a reluctant Europe \u2014 is the right one. \nThis form of remedy violates two basic economic principles, according to Yanis Varoufakis, an economics professor and blogger at the University of Athens. \u201cYou do not lend money at high interest rates to the insolvent and you do not introduce austerity into a recession,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple: the debt is going up and G.D.P. is going down. Have we not learned the lesson of 1929?\u201d \nThe arrest on Saturday of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the head of the I.M.F., on charges related to sexual assault could create new uncertainty about a push for more severe austerity. Mr. Strauss-Kahn generally favored a less onerous approach, and if he is forced to resign it is possible that tougher conditions preferred by Germany will be imposed.\nBut while the debate over how to fix the Greek economy has played out in public, the ways in which this slump is tearing at the country\u2019s social fabric are less well known. The transformation has been jarring to a citizenry long accustomed to a generous welfare state.\nSocial workers and municipal officials in Athens report that there has been a 25 percent increase in homelessness. At the main food kitchen in Athens, 3,500 people a day come seeking food and clothing, up from about 100 people a day when it first opened 10 years ago. \nThe average age of those who show up is now 47, down from 60 two years ago, adding to evidence that those who are suffering now are former professionals. The unemployment rate for men 30 to 60 years old has spiked to 10 percent from 4 percent since the crisis began in 2008.\nAris Violatzis, Anargyros D.\u2019s counselor, says that calls to the Klimaka charity\u2019s suicide help line have risen to 30 a day, twice the number two years ago.\n\u201cWe cannot imagine this,\u201d Mr. Violatzis said. \u201cWe were once the 29th-richest country in the world. This is a nation in deep emotional shock.\u201d\nEvidence of the emotional and social shock was abundant in Athens last week. Even as I.M.F. and European banking officials worked with Greek officials to hash out the contours of a second bailout package, a nicely dressed middle-aged woman with silver buckles on her shoes sifted through the garbage cans outside the five-star hotels where many of these officials were staying.\nAt dusk, riot police fired tear gas at rock-throwing protesters as tourists and workers on their way home took cover. \nLaid off construction workers have holed up in abandoned villas. A security guard fired by one of the many downsizing Greek companies said he had spent the last year sleeping in the back seat of his battered hatchback. And a chef trained in the premier cooking school in Athens spent 18 months sleeping on park benches after the restaurant where he worked eliminated his job. A homeless charity recently gave him shelter.\nWhile aid workers refer to these people as a new generation of homeless, the Greek government does not officially recognize the homeless as a social category in need of assistance, says Anta Alamanu, who runs a privately financed shelter for Klimaka, the social services group.\nAs a result there are no government-supported homeless shelters as they exist in other parts of Europe or in the United States. \nWhen Kostas DeLazaris, 47, lost his tourism job on the island of Corfu in 2007, he joined a construction firm in Athens, only to lose that job 10 months ago as the once-buoyant building industry ground to a halt. Now he sleeps on the floor in an abandoned house, sharing the space with two Greek women and a family of Bangladeshi immigrants. \n\n9 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nHe was a dedicated union man when he worked in tourism, serving as vice president of his local branch. But on the same day last week that his former peers marched on Parliament in protest, he said he would not be joining them.\n\u201cI feel betrayed,\u201d he said, his voice rising in anger. \u201cI paid my dues. I was part of the masses, and now I am on the streets.\u201d \nHe snorts at the possibility of a new deal with Europe.\n\u201cThat is a dead end,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be an earthquake instead and blood will be spilt.\u201d\nIndeed, there are analysts who argue that a social flare-up is in the making, fueled by the divide between the hard-hit private sector and a public work force of about one million strong that so far has not experienced significant job losses.\n\u201cThis is an explosive situation, and there could well be violence,\u201d said Stefanos Manos, a former economy minister who has advocated more aggressive spending cuts. \u201cEspecially as those who lost their jobs were earning 50 percent less than those who kept them.\u201d\nThere is mounting criticism that Prime Minister George A. Papandreou, after a burst of changes last year, has lost his nerve. A plan to raise 50 billion euros by 2015 by privatizing the publicly owned power and train companies has been a bitter disappointment. Those companies, home to powerful unions that protect what some view as thousands of excess workers, remain largely untouched by reforms. \nMr. Papandreou has achieved some success in opening up closed professions and reforming the country\u2019s pension and retirement systems. And he still retains the support of many Greeks, who believe that there is no better alternative.\nBut his critics say he may be avoiding the difficult choices in the belief that, as the saying goes here, the god of Greece will save Greece by means of a fresh European bailout.\nThat is what Richard Parker, a political economist from Harvard who is serving as one of Mr. Papandreou\u2019s top outside advisers, thinks should happen. Germany, he says, has to overcome its Calvinist instincts and write Greece one big check so that it can continue its economic overhaul process.\n\u201cGreece\u2019s debt is just 3 percent of the euro zone G.D.P.,\u201d said Mr. Parker, who has known Mr. Papandreou for more than 40 years. \u201cAnd the price of tipping over Europe will be much larger. My attitude is, give them the money.\u201d\nGreece may well get the assistance, with strings attached, of course. But whether that will help lift Anargyros D. out of his despondency remains unclear. At age 41, he lives off his father\u2019s monthly pension of 962 euros, which is down from 1,500 euros a year ago, and he must borrow money for the bus from his home in the Peloponnese region to his counseling sessions in Athens.\n\u201cEverything was coming up roses,\u201d he said, mashing a cigarette into the ashtray before him. \u201cAnd then the banks took it all away from us.\u201d",

    "text": "Refugee Agency Reports \u2018Humanitarian Emergency\u2019 as Multitudes Flee Libya\n2011-02-28T10:29:29.000Z\nPARIS \u0097 Almost 100,000 people have fled Libya\u2019s fighting for neighboring Egypt and Tunisia, the United Nations refugee agency said, in what it called a humanitarian emergency.\nThe numbers seem to have increased over the weekend as armed rebel forces moved closer to a showdown with Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and his loyalists who were standing their ground in Tripoli, the capital, and a handful of other places.\nThe executive director of the World Food Program traveled to Tunisia on Monday to meet with government officials on refugees\u2019 needs and the impact on the region. In Geneva, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that the United States Agency for International Development was dispatching two teams to Libya\u2019s borders in Egypt and Tunisia to assess the need for emergency assistance. She said the aid agency had set aside $10 million for humanitarian assistance and begun an inventory of American emergency food supplies.\nOn Monday, the French prime minister, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, said in Paris that his country was sending two planes carrying doctors, nurses, medications and medical equipment to the rebels\u2019 eastern stronghold of Benghazi.\nPeople from the United States and many European nations have been evacuated by sea and air from Tripoli and Benghazi, using the island of Malta as a staging point. The European Union said in Brussels that most of its 10,000 people in Libya had left, but that 650 were still asking to be evacuated, many of them from areas where rescue is difficult, The Associated Press reported. China said Monday that it had sent four military transport planes to rescue the remaining 1,000 of some 30,000 of its people who were there before the crisis.\n Kristalina Georgieva, the European Union\u2019s crisis response commissioner, said that 1.5 million additional foreigners remained in Libya, increasing pressure on the borders with Egypt and Tunisia as non-Libyans sought to flee.\nIn a statement on Sunday, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, based in Geneva, said Tunisian authorities had estimated that 40,000 refugees had arrived from Libya in a week. And Egyptian authorities said 55,000 people had fled since Feb. 19. Over half the total number of refugees were Egyptians, the refugee agency said, but they also included Libyans, Chinese and people from several other Asian countries.\nTelevision coverage at Libya\u2019s land borders showed mainly poor contract workers carrying few possessions. Some footage showed hundreds of people crossing into Tunisia, then sitting on the ground, awaiting help. \n \u201cWe are committed to assisting Tunisia and Egypt in helping each and every person fleeing Libya,\u201d said Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the high commissioner for refugees. \u201cWe call upon the international community to respond quickly and generously to enable these governments to cope with this humanitarian emergency.\u201d\nThe crisis in Libya had left people from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sudan and Thailand stranded with no travel documents as they tried to flee to Egypt, the refugee agency\u2019s statement said. The agency said it had sent more than 100 tons of supplies like tents, blankets and cooking equipment.\n\u201cAccording to the tribal leaders, Africans are being treated with suspicion in eastern Libya, due to rumors about the government employing mercenaries from sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d the statement said. \nReuters reported Monday that Kenyans who fled said they had faced attacks and hostility from Libyan citizens and officials who branded them as mercenaries supporting Colonel Qaddafi. A Kenya Airways flight landed in Nairobi with 90 Kenyans and 64 people from Burundi, Congo, Lesotho, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe, officials said.\n \u201cWe were being attacked by local people who said that we were mercenaries killing people,\u201d Julius Kiluu, 60, a building supervisor, told Reuters. \u201cLet me say that they did not want to see black people.\u201d\nLast week, British and German military planes flew into Libya\u2019s desert to pluck hundreds of people from remote oil installations and, British news reports said, the British C-130 Hercules military transports were protected by special forces units in case they came under attack.",

    "text": "Libyan War Traps Poor Immigrants at Tripoli\u2019s Edge\n2011-03-08T02:58:07.000Z\nTRIPOLI, Libya \u2014 As wealthier nations send boats and planes to rescue their citizens from the violence in Libya, a new refugee crisis is taking shape on the outskirts of Tripoli, where thousands of migrant workers from sub-Saharan Africa have been trapped with scant food and water, no international aid and little hope of escape.\nThe migrants \u2014 many of them illegal immigrants from Ghana and Nigeria who have long constituted an impoverished underclass in Libya \u2014 live amid piles of garbage, sleep in makeshift tents of blankets strung from fences and trees, and breathe fumes from a trench of excrement dividing their camp from the parking lot of Tripoli\u2019s airport.\nFor dinner on Monday night two men killed a scrawny, half-plucked chicken by dunking it in water boiled on a garbage fire, then hacked it apart with a dull knife and cooked it over an open fire. Some residents of the camp are as young as Essem Ighalo, 9 days old, who arrived on his second day of life and has yet to see a doctor. Many refugees said they had seen deaths from hunger and disease every night.\nThe airport refugees, along with tens of thousands of other African migrants lucky enough to make it across the border to Tunisia, are the most desperate contingent of a vast exodus that has already sent almost 200,000 foreigners fleeing the country since the outbreak of the popular revolt against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi nearly three weeks ago.\nDark-skinned Africans say the Libyan war has caught them in a vise. The heavily armed police and militia forces loyal to Colonel Qaddafi who guard checkpoints along the roads around the capital rob them of their money, possessions and cellphone chips, the migrants say. And the Libyans who oppose Colonel Qaddafi lash out at the African migrants because they look like the dark-skinned mercenaries many here say the Libyan leader has recruited to crush the uprising.\n\u201cQaddafi has brought African soldiers to kill some of them, so if they see black people they beat them,\u201d said Samson Adda, 31, who said residents of Zawiyah, a rebellious city, had beaten him so badly that he could no longer walk.\nSub-Saharan Africans make up a vast majority of the estimated 1.5 million illegal immigrants among Libya\u2019s population of 6.5 million, according to the International Organization for Migration. Many were desperately poor people made even more so by investments of up to $1,000 each to pay smugglers to bring them across Libya\u2019s southern border for a chance at better work in its oil economy.\nTheir flight has emptied the streets of thousands of day laborers who played a crucial, if largely unheralded, role in sustaining Libya\u2019s economy. Their absence has played a role in halting construction projects that had been rising across the skyline.\nThey are trapped in part because most lack passports or other documents necessary to board a plane or cross the border. Few can afford a plane ticket. They say they are afraid to leave the airport or try their luck on the roads to the border for fear of assaults by Libyan citizens or at militia checkpoints.\nThey complain bitterly of betrayal by their home governments, which have failed to help evacuate them even as Egyptian, Bangladeshi and Chinese migrant workers who crowded the airport a week ago have found a way out.\nAnd international aid workers, who have raced to minister to the hundreds of thousands camped on the borders, say the migrants trapped at the airport remain beyond their reach. The Libyan government\u2019s tight security and the threat of violence on the streets of Tripoli have apparently prevented any international aid groups from reaching the makeshift camps.\n\u201cWe are operating out of Benghazi,\u201d said Jean-Philippe Chauzy of the International Organization for Migration, referring to the eastern Libyan city that is the headquarters of the rebellion. \u201cBut unfortunately because of the conditions we can\u2019t help them out of Tripoli.\u201d\nThe outbreak of violence in Tripoli around Feb. 20 sent migrants of all kinds fleeing for the airport. Until recently, desperate hordes of all nationalities were sleeping packed together on the floors of the terminals or in the fields and parking lots outside. Guards with whips and clubs beat them back to clear the entrance.\nDespite Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s brotherly pan-African rhetoric, racial xenophobia is common here. Many Libyans, ethnically Arab, look down on Chinese, Bangladeshis and darker-skinned Africans, in that order. Many African refugees here and in the camps on the Tunisian border say Libyans often addressed them as \u201cabd,\u201d or slave.\n\u201cEven if someone stabs you with a knife and you go to the police to report it, they won\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d said Paul Eke, 34, a Nigerian who was camped out at the Tunisian border, displaying a mangled arm as evidence of his firsthand experience. \u201cIn the hospitals, no one will care for you. They just don\u2019t like blacks.\u201d\nBut many said it was the presence of mercenaries from other African countries that made the situation unbearable. \u201cQaddafi brought the mercenaries who are black, so the people are chasing us,\u201d one 30-year-old Nigerian said.\nPerhaps as many as 100,000 refugees, most of them sub-Saharan Africans, have made it to the Tunisian camps, where groups like the Red Crescent, the Muslim counterpart to the Red Cross, care for the sick. The United States has lent planes to fly Egyptian refugees home from Tunisia.\nBut the crowds left at the airport, now almost exclusively African, have no such support. Some have been there for two weeks or more.\nSeveral said that someone \u2014 perhaps with a local charity, perhaps with the Libyan government \u2014 had given them each a biscuit. On Monday refugees holding bottles lined up at the back of a tanker truck dispensing water.\nBut an exploitative economy has also sprung up. A group of burly, well-dressed men stood by a sport utility vehicle in the parking lot holding thick stacks of dollars, euros and Libyan dinars and offering to change money at usurious rates.\nMany of the workers had been paid in foreign currency but need to change it to buy a Coke, a candy bar, or perhaps an emaciated chicken from the vendors who have turned up to profit from the camps. Several refugees said a live chicken cost about $8 in the camp, more than four times what it might have cost before the crisis.\nBathing is another problem. A Ghanaian woman said angrily that she had not washed in nine days.\n\u201cSome women try to wash naked in the bushes,\u201d a Nigerian man said. \u201cIt is an abomination.\u201d\nBut many said the worst indignity was being robbed of their few possessions either by soldiers with machine guns or by young civilians carrying knives.\n\u201cThe most painful thing is this: A lot of people buy things, for more than two years they are gathering their own money to keep their own things that they will take to Nigeria,\u201d the Nigerian man said. \u201cBut the little things that you have \u2014 like tele, plasma, clothes, shoes, bags, all your assets \u2014 they take everything.\u201d\nAnother man added: \u201cJust imagine: We are poor people, and they are robbing us. They are taking our dinars, our euros, our pounds. They are taking our mobile phones and SIM cards.\u201d\nThe loss of the cellphones \u2014 the Libyan government is confiscating them apparently to prevent the circulation of cellphone pictures of the unrest \u2014 means that many of the refugees have been unable to tell their families they are alive, several said.\nMany said that after waiting days for people from their embassies to help arrange their travel papers, they had given up hope in their home countries.\n\u201cWe are somebody and we are from somewhere,\u201d said Abru Razak, 35, a Nigerian with two daughters, 2 and 5, at the airport. \u201cEven when we get into the airport they are beating us and pushing us. We are dying. Tell the United Nations they should get us away from here \u2014 to anywhere, just to save our lives.\u201d",

    "text": "On Libya\u2019s Revolutionary Road\n2011-03-30T14:22:17.000Z\nOn the evening of Feb. 8, Khalid Saih found himself in the back of a speeding car on the outskirts of Tripoli. It was not by choice. Saih, a lanky 36-year-old lawyer, was part of a small group of Libyan activists who were openly calling for a new constitution and more civil rights. After months of harassment by the police, he and three fellow lawyers were ordered to report to the Interior Ministry in Tripoli. From there, with no warning, they were bundled into a car and told they would be meeting the Leader.\nThe men were terrified. None had met Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi before. All of them had friends or relatives who had been tortured or murdered in his prisons. As they rode, they made contact with friends back in their hometown, Benghazi, to report their location, in case they were imprisoned or killed. To calm their nerves, they recited a prayer that is invoked in situations of great danger:\nGod is great,\nGod the dearest of all Creation,\nGod is greater than what I fear,\nI take refuge in God,\nThere is no protection but he from the evil servant and his soldiers,\nGod be my protector from the bulk of their evil. \nAfter a half-hour they arrived at a gated compound with a sign marked in Arabic \u201cEquestrian Club of Abu Sitteh.\u201d There were uniformed guards with guns and layers of barbed wire. The car stopped, and a man took the lawyers\u2019 cellphones and escorted them to a large Bedouin-style tent, illuminated by an enormous bonfire in front. They went in and sat down at a long, dimly lighted table. An attendant brought them glasses of fresh camel\u2019s milk. Then Qaddafi entered, wearing brown Bedouin robes and a fur hat with flaps hanging down the sides. With him were two of his top security aides, Abdullah al-Sanousi and Ahmed Qaddaf al-Dam, both well-known and feared men. The Leader shook the lawyers\u2019 hands and joined them at the head of the table.\nFor the next two hours, Qaddafi lectured the men. He warned them not to encourage the kinds of protests that had overthrown one dictator in Tunisia and would soon topple another, Hosni Mubarak, in Egypt. \u201cTake down your Facebook pages, your demands will be met,\u201d Qaddafi said. At times, he muttered to himself at length, leaving the lawyers baffled and embarrassed.\nAs he listened, Saih felt his fear giving way to a deep and unexpected reassurance. It was not Qaddafi\u2019s drugged, monotone voice that soothed him. Nor was it the Leader\u2019s seeming desperation or his promises of reform, which Saih did not believe. Instead, it was the mere sight of him up close, an old man with a wrinkled, sagging face.\n\u201cI saw he\u2019s a real human being,\u201d Saih told me. \u201cAfter so long, we had come to think maybe he is a robot, that he will never die. The youth had begun to lose hope. But when I saw him, I thought: He is just a man. This will come to an end, finally.\u201d\nWhen I met Saih in early March, he was at a bare desk in the Benghazi courthouse. The city, the largest in eastern Libya, freed itself from Qaddafi\u2019s control a week earlier. A damp sea breeze came in from the window. Saih, dressed in a rumpled brown suit, had become something of a celebrity: Al Arabiya, the satellite TV channel, was waiting outside for an interview. He was a member of the Libyan National Council, the governing body set up by the rebels. The courthouse was its base, an array of featureless gray buildings along the city\u2019s Mediterranean seafront. Ad hoc municipal committees were meeting in rooms once used for trials and interrogations; paper signs hung on the doors, stating their new purpose. Young men in red military berets strode through the corridors, their faces glowing with zeal. The walls were covered with fresh graffiti lampooning Qaddafi. Outside, a loudspeaker blared the refrain of a revolutionary anthem \u2014 \u201cwe will remain\u201d \u2014 as crowds of people milled around to hear the latest news.\nIt was not clear how long they would remain. Battles raged already in the desert towns of Ras Lanouf and Brega, less than 150 miles to the southwest. The rebels\u2019 ragged volunteer militia was vastly outgunned by Qaddafi\u2019s forces, which would reach the gates of Benghazi before American and European war planes began pounding them with bombs on March 19. The Libyan revolt started with Facebook calls for protests just like its counterparts in Tunisia and Egypt. Now it was devolving into a much bloodier and more prolonged civil war. Libya\u2019s struggle would draw in the United Nations Security Council and a fragile coalition of Western and Arab military partners, muddying the heroic narrative of an indigenous Arab uprising.\nBut on that morning, Saih still had the dazed look of a survivor who cannot quite believe his own good luck. No one, he told me, not even the most committed dissidents or the most na\u00efve optimists, had believed that Qaddafi would be defeated in Benghazi. The courthouse where he now sat in his own bare office, with a view of the wintry waves just across the city\u2019s corniche, had been a place of fear and oppression. \u201cNow it is the heart of Free Libya,\u201d he said.\nII Saih was there when the Libyan revolt began, less than three weeks earlier. He and a group of fellow lawyers gathered after dark on Feb. 15 outside police headquarters in downtown Benghazi to demand the release of a colleague, Fathi Terbil, who was arrested earlier that day. Terbil was representing the relatives of about 1,200 men killed by Libyan security forces at Abu Salim prison in 1996. Some of the dead men\u2019s relatives were also there.\nAs the chanting crowd made its way through the city, more people joined them. The demonstration swelled, and soon hundreds of people were marching and chanting \u201cthe people want an end to corruption!\u201d and other slogans borrowed from the protesters in Tunisia and Egypt. After midnight, the police fired water cannons at them, and groups of thugs attacked with clubs and broken bottles. The protesters fought back with stones and later dispersed. The next day, the protests resumed and grew more violent as the first groups of mercenaries appeared, in yellow construction hats, to fight the protesters. Some were Africans; some appeared to be foreign workers, including Bangladeshis and Chinese. Many were not mercenaries at all, but dark-skinned men from southern Libya or hapless African migrants in search of work. Some of the ones I talked to, in makeshift rebel prisons, said they had been tricked with promises of jobs and never paid at all.\nOn Feb. 17, the scheduled \u201cDay of Rage,\u201d soldiers and the police opened fire with machine guns on unarmed crowds. Soon, photographs circulated of bodies torn in half by high-caliber weapons. Unarmed young men climbed into bulldozers and drove them in suicidal attempts to breach the high green-and-white walls of the Katiba, the last stronghold of Qaddafi\u2019s authority left in the city, a vast compound that dominates Benghazi\u2019s downtown like a medieval fort. The death toll shot up, and the initial core of politically active protesters like Saih and his fellow lawyers soon grew to encompass a broad swath of Benghazi\u2019s roughly 800,000 people.\nOne of them was Mahdi Ziu. His home was about 200 yards from the Katiba, and he saw a young man shot to death right outside his front door. Ziu was anything but an agitator: he worked as a middle manager at the Arabian Gulf Oil Company. He was a paunchy man, sedentary and diabetic, with thinning hair and glasses and a resigned expression. He liked to read and surf the Internet, his daughter and brother told me. He had a soft heart and often cried when watching television dramas with his wife and daughter on the living-room couch. He disliked politics and tended toward moderation in all things: he would walk away when he heard religious extremists fulminating about right and wrong at the local mosque. But after three days of brutal killing in his hometown, something snapped. \u201cHe kept saying, \u2018Jihad, jihad, this is the time for us all to go out and fight,\u2019 \u201d his 21-year-old daughter, Zuhour, told me. Zuhour seemed to alternate between awe and horror as she quietly narrated her father\u2019s death (his wife was sequestered, in accordance with Muslim mourning custom). She sat on a couch in the living room, a slim, pretty girl in a head scarf with her hands folded uneasily in front of her. The neighbor\u2019s baby whined in the next room, and a photograph of her father\u2019s face sat on the table nearby. \u201cIf you heard this man,\u201d Zuhour continued, \u201cyou would know he was ready for something.\u201d No one else in the family had taken part in the protests; Mahdi\u2019s brother told me, a little regretfully, that he had been too frightened.\nBy Sunday, Feb. 20, protesters in Benghazi had armed themselves and were focusing all their efforts on storming the Katiba. Every day, soldiers inside the barracks were firing down on the funeral processions that used the long boulevard from the courthouse to the city\u2019s main cemetery, killing more people and generating more funerals, more anger.\nOn Sunday morning, with the sound of gunfire in the background, Ziu slipped a last will and testament under the door of a friend. He then returned to his apartment and asked the neighbors to help him load a number of full gas canisters into his black Kia sedan, parked just outside the house. They asked why, and he told them the canisters were leaking; he needed to get them fixed. His brother, Salem Ziu, told me that he thinks Mahdi used a small patch of TNT, the kind Libyans use to kill fish, as a detonator. No one really knows.\nWhat is certain is that about 1:30 p.m., Ziu drove his car until it was facing the Katiba\u2019s main gate, near the police station where the first protests began five days earlier. The area in front of him was clear, a killing zone abandoned by all but the most reckless. Rebels fired from the shelter of rooftops and doorways, and snipers at the Katiba fired occasional shots down on the figures darting in the streets. Ziu put his foot down on the accelerator. The guards opened fire, but too late. The speeding car struck the gate and exploded, sending up a fireball that was captured on a cellphone video by a protester a few hundred yards away. The blast blew a hole in the wall, killing a number of guards and sending the rest retreating into the Katiba. Within hours, it would fall to the protesters.\nThe remains of Ziu\u2019s charred and crumpled car now lie by the open gate of the Katiba. Above and around it are tributes to him in looping spray-painted letters: \u201cMahdi the Hero.\u201d \u201cMahdi, who liberated the Katiba.\u201d\nEarlier that same day, Emad al-Imam was walking in a funeral procession in downtown Benghazi. He, too, was unused to protests. A 42-year-old father of two who worked as an administrator at an agricultural company, he joined the procession only out of sympathy. As he passed near the Katiba, machine-gun fire raked the mourners. Imam dropped to the ground. His head was protected by a concrete block on the pavement; he could feel the bullets whining past his upturned ear. He lay there \u2014 it felt like 10 hours, he told me, but it was probably only 10 minutes \u2014 until the shooting stopped. He opened his eyes and saw four soldiers pointing AK-47s at his head.\n\u201cThey made me get up and searched me,\u201d he told me. \u201cOne of them hit me on the head with his gun stock, and I fell on my face. He put his foot on my neck. They were arguing about whether to kill me now or bring me inside first.\u201d\nThe men took him by the arms and dragged him into the Katiba, through a gate not far from where Mahdi Ziu would soon launch his kamikaze drive. He did not resist. Inside, they blindfolded him and threw him onto the floor. After a few minutes, he worked the blindfold off far enough to see that he was in a room with 60 or 70 prisoners. A soldier walked up and beat him savagely, he said. Someone fired a gun next to his head. He turned and watched the soldier fire two more bullets into the body of the man sitting next to him. Then they dragged Imam into another room, where they used electric wires to burn his legs. By this time, he could hear fierce exchanges of gunfire outside the Katiba walls. The protesters had now acquired heavier weapons from looted military barracks in Bayda and other eastern towns, and some of Qaddafi\u2019s soldiers had defected to join them. The siege of the Katiba was in its last hour.\n\u201cBoth sides were firing so hard that paint flakes were falling from the ceiling,\u201d Imam told me. \u201cOne of the soldiers with me said, \u2018Before we die, you will.\u2019 \u201d\nAnother soldier asked, \u201cWho here comes from Bayda?\u201d One protester said he was from there, and the soldier told a comrade, \u201cGive me that bayonet.\u201d He took it and began slashing the prisoner brutally. Imam was born in Bayda, and it is written on his national ID card. He lay there, waiting for them to find the card and kill him too. But the sound of gunfire got closer and closer, and before long the soldiers ran out of the room, leaving the prisoners alone. Some time later, a group of armed protesters ran in. \u201cWho are you?\u201d one of them shouted. One captive cried out, \u201cDon\u2019t hurt us, we are with you.\u201d The protesters untied them. But Imam and his comrades were too frightened to leave. He listened to the gunfire, tried unsuccessfully to get up and then passed out.\nHe woke up in a hospital. He had burns and bruises all over his body. The doctors told him to rest, but he wanted to find his parents, to let them know he was alive. He staggered off the bed. The doctors had given him Valium. He fell down twice, and then, emerging into the darkened street, began limping home.\nEmad\u2019s father, a tall, stoic-looking man of 65 named Miftah al-Imam, told me he started to worry after his son was missing for several hours. He called Emad\u2019s cellphone, and an unfamiliar voice answered. \u201cMay I speak to the owner of this phone?\u201d Miftah said. The voice said, \u201cThe owner of this phone is being burned,\u201d laughed and hung up. The words sounded so strange to Miftah that he thought his son\u2019s phone had been taken by a child or practical joker. He called several family friends, and then, reluctantly, he went to a nearby hospital.\nHe found a terrifying scene, Miftah told me. The hospital was full of the wounded, people shouting, blood on the floors, pandemonium. He found a doctor who showed him a list: his son\u2019s name was not on it. He walked to another hospital. This one was overwhelmed, too. No one recognized Emad\u2019s name. Miftah pleaded for help finding his son, and a kindly nurse told him there was one unidentified body. She led him into a makeshift morgue where a covered corpse lay on a gurney and pulled back the cloth from a young man\u2019s face. Miftah approached. There was a bullet hole in the side of the head. Miftah looked, and felt his stomach wrench. The face was a little fuller than Emad\u2019s, but that could be from torture. He was certain this was his son.\n\u201cI kissed his forehead,\u201d Miftah told me when we met in Benghazi, a week later. \u201c \u2018May God have mercy on you,\u2019 \u201d I said. \u201c \u2018May God take revenge on injustice.\u2019 \u201d He gave his name to the hospital staff and told them the body was his son. One doctor, seeing that Miftah looked pale and unsteady on his feet, drove him home. Back at the house, Miftah gave the news to his wife and to Emad\u2019s wife and two children, who live on a different floor. The sound of shrieking and sobbing filled the house. The neighbors heard and came to pay their condolences. For two hours, more friends and relatives arrived to comfort the bereaved family.\nIt was then that Emad staggered through the front door, into his own funeral.\nIII When I arrived in Benghazi a few days later, the city was still drunk on victory. Crowds were gathered outside the courthouse, chanting anti-Qaddafi slogans, and passing cars were honking their horns in celebration. It had been raining for days \u2014 the rebels called it a sign of divine approval \u2014 and now vast puddles in the muddy streets reflected an operatic evening sky, with storm clouds rolling away to reveal bright stars over the Mediterranean. Signs of battle were everywhere, as in some of the smaller cities I passed through on the nine-hour drive from the open Egyptian border: bullet holes dotting the facades, rubble piled on the medians, police stations burned black. The city sprawled south and west from its seafront corniche, a dusty, gray-and-tan landscape of mostly low-slung, ugly block houses, with only a few fading remnants of Italian colonial architecture. There was little color or advertising aside from shredded posters of the Leader and the ubiquitous anti-Qaddafi graffiti. At the Katiba, young men and boys were milling around, staring at the ruins in wonder. Some told me they were there to search for relatives who disappeared years before in the maze of Qaddafi\u2019s prisons. One old man grabbed my arm and shouted: \u201cBefore, to see this place was to die. Now it is ours.\u201d\nAll across eastern Libya, the collapse of Qaddafi\u2019s regime exposed an unknown world of walled military compounds and torture rooms belonging to the Leader and his gang. Protesters burned and destroyed almost all of them, police stations, jails, security branches \u2014 and there were so many: external security, internal security, national security, intelligence.\nOn my second day in the city, I visited one of those prisons with a gap-toothed 28-year-old man named Osama Makhzoum. He was an unemployed accountant, well educated and disgusted by the corruption around him, who was among the first protesters on Feb. 15. He had a clownish, affectionate smile, and he spoke in a rapid-fire stream of anecdotes and jokes that was impossible to keep up with; it was as if a decade of dammed-up words had just been unleashed. \u201cBy God, Libyans were afraid to say Qaddafi\u2019s name before, and now they are fighting him,\u201d he told me as we drove across town that day in his beat-up silver Renault sedan. \u201cThis is a good thing.\u201d\n\n9 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nThe prison where he was held five years earlier was a maze of buildings in western Benghazi, a mile or so from the Katiba. We walked across a courtyard full of deep rain puddles to his old cellblock, blackened from smoke. \u201cThis is where they took away my belt and shoes when I arrived,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is my cell.\u201d It was a tiny, dark room, about 5 feet by 7 feet, with a single open window near the ceiling. When it rained, he and his thin cotton mattress would get soaked, he told me. The men were allowed one bathroom visit a day. The room now had only a filthy metal bowl and some scraps of food. The cell doors were all open, and some of the walls had fresh graffiti on them: \u201cDown with Muammar the bastard\u201d and \u201cWhere are you now, Ziyad al-Zawi?\u201d Zawi was a notorious intelligence officer who had worked here. Osama was interrogated by him repeatedly, always blindfolded. Eventually they decided Osama was not guilty of anything \u2014 they had arrested him in a sweep \u2014 and let him go, with no apology. \u201cThis experience affected me,\u201d Osama said. \u201cI became antisocial. I threw my cellphone chip away so they could not arrest my friends.\u201d But he had got off easy, he said. His great-uncle had been jailed at Abu Salim, also in a routine sweep, and was among the roughly 1,200 men massacred there in 1996.\nLater that day, Osama took me to Benghazi\u2019s main cemetery, a vast, dusty expanse on the western edge of town. Scores of freshly dug graves marked the \u201cmartyrs\u201d area, where those killed in the previous week\u2019s fighting were buried. Many were lacking headstones; Osama told me materials were in short supply in Benghazi. He showed me the grave of a close friend, Zuhair al-Tuwaybi. He described how he and Tuwaybi set off together to protest on Feb. 18 and became separated. Plainclothes police officers opened fire on the group, and Tuwaybi was shot through the heart. Osama stared at the grave. Then he choked up and walked off toward the cemetery gate to hide his tears.\nBenghazi has long been a bulwark of resistance to Qaddafi and his rule. The city is the capital of Libya\u2019s eastern region, known as Cyrenaica, and it has paid dearly for its independence. Its streets and houses are tatty and decayed. There is little left of Benghazi\u2019s ancient history as a Greek and Roman port or even of the Italian occupation, from 1911 to 1943. The region\u2019s proudest legacy is the struggle against Italian colonialism led by Omar al-Mukhtar, the Libyan national hero who was hanged by Mussolini in 1931. His mausoleum used to be in Benghazi, not far from the village where he was born. But Qaddafi moved it south of the city, in a deliberate slap. By that time, Qaddafi had turned against Benghazi, where several plots against him originated, starting in the 1970s. He hanged the conspirators in public and let the city\u2019s once-thriving port and its roads and public buildings fall into decay. Residents say he redirected raw sewage into the lagoon by its downtown, so that a foul stench drifts over the plaza nearby. Eastern Libya has more lush farmland than the West and most of the country\u2019s oil reserves. But Benghazi received little of that windfall. Unemployment is high, even by Libyan standards. Many streets in the poorer neighborhoods are unpaved. On the city\u2019s desert edges, half-built housing complexes lurk in the distance.\nOsama came from a family that \u2014 like many in Benghazi \u2014 hated Qaddafi passionately for generations. His grandfather was a wealthy businessman whose fortune was destroyed by the Leader\u2019s quasi-Marxist economic policies. \u201cOne day in 1984, my grandfather had a big shipment coming into the port in Benghazi,\u201d Osama told me. \u201cThe revolutionary committee confiscated all of it and started selling it in government markets. My grandfather heard about it, and he died later that day.\u201d\nThe family once owned several shops and apartment buildings. But starting in the 1970s, Qaddafi implemented a principle from his revolutionary Green Book known as al bayt li sakinihi, or \u201cthe house to its resident.\u201d The government seized many properties and gave them to whoever was renting or using them. Squatters took over the Makhzoum family properties, and the revolutionary committees took their shops. One Benghazi businessman I met described, weeping, how he was jailed for months, and tortured, while Qaddafi\u2019s auditors checked his books for signs of theft. They found none. \u201cAfter that we kept a very low profile,\u201d the businessman told me.\nQaddafi did not start out as a radical. When he and a group of fellow officers replaced Libya\u2019s frail monarchy in 1969, they considered themselves youthful prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of the Arab nationalist leader, Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt. Qaddafi spoke of social justice, of Arab pride, of developing the country with Libya\u2019s gift of oil wealth. Many of the people who spoke most bitterly about his rule told me they supported him heartily at first and even took to the streets after the 1969 coup to support this handsome, youthful officer. It was only years later, after Qaddafi grew frustrated with the pace of change, that his messianic and violent persona emerged. Qaddafi reprised his redistribution policies earlier this year, as the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt were gathering steam. With no warning, he appeared on Libyan state television and urged poor people to squat in a vast middle-class housing complex in Benghazi that was almost complete. The units had all been sold in advance, and their owners were furious; fights broke out as poor families flooded into the complex after the Leader\u2019s speech. It seems very likely that Qaddafi was hoping the conflict would distract people from their protest plans.\nThe ostensible goal of Qaddafi\u2019s Green Book was to create an egalitarian society in which the ills of capitalism and socialism would vanish and the people would govern themselves. In practice, all the privileges were transferred to members at the highest levels of the revolutionary committees, who became an unacknowledged ruling class in Qaddafi\u2019s delusional Jamahiriya, or \u201crepublic of the masses.\u201d\nEveryone in Libya knew who these revolutionary committee leaders were and where they lived. Driving through downtown Benghazi, I noticed a burned building in a residential district. I asked if it was another police station. \u201cNo,\u201d Osama said, \u201cthat is Huda\u2019s house.\u201d Huda bin Amer, he explained, had been the leader of the revolutionary committee in Benghazi and one of Qaddafi\u2019s most feared lieutenants. She came to prominence in 1984, at a public hanging of several men accused of plotting to kill Qaddafi. As one of the dying men jiggled on the end of his rope, Huda \u2014 everyone knows her by her first name \u2014 rushed up and pulled on his legs, to dispatch him more quickly. No one could document that this story took place, but it is told universally and has become part of her public persona. She is famous for having coined the phrase \u201cWe don\u2019t want talk, we want hangings in the public square.\u201d Huda fled Benghazi at the start of the protests in February and is now said to be with Qaddafi in Tripoli.\nThe poor, meanwhile, do not seem to have gained much from Qaddafi\u2019s Marxist sloganeering. Osama drove me through a poor neighborhood called Sirti, where the unpaved streets were lakes of raw sewage and the buildings were crumbling ruins. It reminded me of the worst parts of Basra in southern Iraq after the American invasion in 2003. Even in Benghazi\u2019s wealthier neighborhoods, there was no working sewage system, and most families had to build their own sewage-disposal pits.\nOn the road again, we passed Benghazi\u2019s main theater; someone had written on it in big letters \u201cQaddafi: The theatrics are over.\u201d Osama chuckled as he reeled off the new revolutionary calendar Qaddafi invented to go with his brave new world. January became Ayannar (where\u2019s the fire?), April became al-Tayr (birds), August became Hannibal (as in the Carthaginian general). Osama recited all 12 months. Even ordinary words like shop and embassy were replaced by the Leader\u2019s populist neologisms, though these do not seem to have caught on with ordinary Libyans. Osama grew more and more animated as he cataloged Qaddafi\u2019s eccentricities, as if he were only now discovering the outrageousness of it all. The self-image as an African \u201cking of kings\u201d; the wild costumes and theatrical tirades; the bizarre lectures on the need to change wordings in the Koran.\n\u201cWe are all asking ourselves, how could this happen?\u201d he said. \u201cWho is this man? You listen to him talk, and you can\u2019t believe he\u2019s sane. Sometimes he talks like a heretic. Me, I think he\u2019s crazy or took too much drugs. You watch TV, and he talks for 75 minutes nonstop, shouting at the top of his lungs. He covers every subject \u2014 magic, health, religion, politics, and not a single sentence makes sense!\u201d\nLater, when I pressed him with more questions about Qaddafi, Osama looked over at me with a weary smile and said: \u201cStop trying to make sense of us. We don\u2019t even understand ourselves.\u201d\nOther Libyans I met expressed the same sense of dawning outrage, as if the collapse of Qaddafi\u2019s authority tilted their perspective on everything. The fear of surveillance and spies \u2014 a constant of Libyan life \u2014 had lifted, and now people seemed to be allowing themselves to feel things they had long kept sheltered inside. One businessman described a video shown on state television a few years ago, in which Qaddafi is shown waiting in a long line at a bank to apply for a housing loan. When the Leader reaches the teller, he is turned down. \u201cHow does he have the audacity to show this?\u201d the businessman said, his eyes suddenly wild with anger. \u201cDoes he really expect people to believe this dictator waits in lines at banks?\u201d\nSymbols of Qaddafi and his family provoked the greatest fury. Near the airport on the edge of town, rebel soldiers took Osama and me to see one of the Leader\u2019s villas. It looked as if a tornado had blown through it. Shattered glass lay everywhere, upturned plants and broken chairs and bloodstains littered the pale marble floor. Qaddafi\u2019s men abandoned the place just before Benghazi fell to the rebels, escaping on a plane. Now it lay empty and silent, with the warm afternoon light falling in through cathedral-high ceilings: a cryptic remnant of the Leader\u2019s excesses.\n\u201cThis is where he kept his whores,\u201d one soldier said.\nHe led us through to a bedroom where knotted piles of brightly colored women\u2019s clothes lay on the carpet, with prescription-drug bottles and playing cards and perfume bottles and cigarettes. Farther on was a bedroom with a vast bed frame, its headboard decorated in gold tracery and plump silk cushions. The soldiers gazed at the rooms with the same awe I did. None of them had ever been there before Benghazi fell on Feb. 21. It reminded me of what I saw in Iraq in 2003: the gaudy villas where Uday Hussein had held drug-fueled parties with Russian prostitutes, the pet lions still prowling in the cage outside. But here, in Benghazi, there was more mystery. Qaddafi was still in power in Tripoli; the men who fled this villa were, presumably, still fighting on with him. No witnesses remained to say who really lived here or what they did. One thing was clear: Some kind of struggle had taken place before the henchmen fled and the place was ransacked by rebels.\n\u201cThey executed two people in here,\u201d a soldier said. \u201cCome.\u201d\nHe led us through a hallway to an office with a desk. Across from it was a couch with big patches of dried blood staining its pale cushions. The desk chair was also covered with blood. Had some of Qaddafi\u2019s men been shot for treachery here? Was there a struggle over whether to flee or join the rebels? Had two men shot each other simultaneously? No one could say.\nEveryone agreed that Al Saadi el-Qaddafi had been here. Saadi, the Leader\u2019s dissolute third son, was in Benghazi when violence broke out there on Feb. 17 and spoke on a radio station to warn Benghazi\u2019s residents to obey him or face the consequences. He fled soon afterward and later appeared at a pro-government rally in Tripoli.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the one who thinks he\u2019s a soccer player,\u201d a soldier said contemptuously. Saadi played briefly in a professional Italian league, though he rarely got on the field and was considered something of a joke. He had a reputation for orgiastic parties at European hotels, where his entourage spent hundreds of thousands of dollars. Later he was presented to the Libyan public as a sober businessman, floating a scheme for a free-trade zone along Libya\u2019s coast.\nThe soldiers showed me two armor-plated cars parked near the airfield, not far from the villa, where Saadi apparently made his last-minute escape. One was a black BMW sedan, the driver\u2019s side window riddled by bullets that shattered the outer layer of glass to a white powdery mass, though none passed all the way through. A black S.U.V. was parked next to it, also pockmarked by bullets. The doors were open, and soldiers and young men were staring at the soft black leather seats in wonder.\nIV On the following morning, the soldiers who showed me the villa piled into a flatbed truck and headed for the front, in Brega, to the southwest. Qaddafi\u2019s loyalists had begun their counteroffensive. Osama and I drove west to follow the rebel fighters, passing through a trash-strewn desert landscape that looked like a scene from \u201cRoad Warrior.\u201d Men of all ages were riding toward the front, howling and firing their pistols and rifles at the sky. Some were dressed in military fatigues and had heavy anti-aircraft guns; they, too, fired joyously as they passed cheering crowds, with a heavy thud-thud that shook the ground. At a staging point near the town of Ajdabiya, I found teenagers making Molotov cocktails and civilian mechanics repairing machine guns. Others kneeled on the ground with belts of ammunition draped over their chests and prostrated themselves in prayer. It was the start of a long, chaotic struggle in which the rebels \u2014 brave but lacking any discipline or command structure \u2014 eventually lost ground to Qaddafi\u2019s better-equipped military. Only French and American warplanes would halt Qaddafi\u2019s advance.\nBack in Benghazi, not everyone was banking on a rebel victory. One night, Osama brought me to the house of his father, Attiya, a professor of political science at Garyounis, the city\u2019s main university. It was a large, comfortable home on a quiet street, with a little courtyard hidden behind a dun-colored wall. In the living room just past the door, I took off my shoes and found two of Attiya\u2019s fellow faculty members sitting in a spare, green-themed living room, reclining on floor cushions and bolsters in the traditional Arab manner and sipping steaming glasses of tea. With them was a young man with a black baseball cap pulled low over his forehead. He had a handsome face, with a cold, calculating expression. His name was Allam Fallah, and he was a graduate student and assistant to the dean at the university. He was also a member of Qaddafi\u2019s revolutionary committees. Fallah was reluctant to talk to me at first or even to give his name. But at the urging of his professors, who were helping to protect him, he spoke up.\n\u201cSome people like me fled or left the country,\u201d Fallah told me after an hour of talk. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t kill anyone, I didn\u2019t steal. I didn\u2019t spy on people. I believed in the revolutionary idea.\u201d He told me the revolutionary committees had four tiers: at the top were the revolutionary guard, a well-armed cadre that was close to Qaddafi. Fallah said he was on the bottom tier. Others who knew him disputed that, saying he was very well connected to powerful insiders in Tripoli.\nFallah appeared to be playing a careful double game, watching to see which way the wind would blow in Qaddafi\u2019s battle with the rebels. In my talks with him, he deplored Qaddafi\u2019s excesses but also criticized the rebels, saying they lacked the ability to unify or govern the country. He portrayed himself as a rebel sympathizer and told me he was at the first demonstration on Feb. 15. But two of his acquaintances told me independently that they saw Fallah that night on the police side, not with the protesters. They also told me he arranged two university buses on Feb. 16 to transport Qaddafi\u2019s mercenaries, who attacked and killed protesters starting on that day.\nFallah moved like a hunted man. He had taken the license plate off his car and rarely traveled during the day. Already, a few members of Qaddafi\u2019s committees had been murdered in Benghazi since the revolt began. His committee boss, the dean of the university and a prominent Qaddafi ally, fled to Tripoli at the start of the uprising. Fallah\u2019s professors told me they knew of people who wanted to kill him. They were protecting him because he helped them in the past, they told me, intervening on their behalf when they ran afoul of Qaddafi\u2019s henchmen. Fallah was clearly a survivor, who hedged his bets from early on. In a sense, everyone in Libya was. Even some of the most vocal rebels, I was told, made little deals for their survival, agreeing to spy on colleagues or provide other favors in exchange for job security. Few of them had come as close to the regime as Fallah.\nFallah told me he was invited to join the local revolutionary committee after Qaddafi heard him speak at a meeting at Garyounis University in 2001, when he was an undergraduate. He said he had been inspired by Qaddafi\u2019s left-wing rhetoric but gradually became disillusioned after seeing the Leader\u2019s hypocrisies.\n\u201cQaddafi speaks of the will of the people, the benefit of the people, those suffering injustice and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you come close to Qaddafi, you don\u2019t see any of this. He just used these progressive words to build a reputation for himself. He didn\u2019t commit to anything, and the Libyan people started to hate progressive thinking because of him.\u201d Fallah described another meeting with Qaddafi in February, in which he and other young committee members urged the Leader to carry out economic and social reforms, to fire the most corrupt ministers.\nIt was impossible to tell whether Fallah\u2019s revolutionary principles had ever been genuine. His committee membership had earned him lavish perks: a nice apartment, a car. \u201cHe\u2019s a double-face, a liar,\u201d I was told by his immediate supervisor at the university, Abdulsalam Faytouri. \u201cHe wants power.\u201d\nThe last time I saw Fallah, he seemed more confident. He spoke disparagingly of the rebels, saying they had no plan for the country. The \u201ctechnocrats and professors\u201d of Benghazi, he said, had no influence. Even the tribes were divided. There was no charismatic leader to rally around; even the leader of the rebels\u2019 provisional government, Mustafa Abduljalil, had no vision for the future. Libya, he said, was still governed by Bedouin values: tribe, family, religion, the importance of a strong leader. Qaddafi understood that.\n\u201cLook what is happening,\u201d Fallah told me. We were sitting in white plastic chairs in the courtyard of Osama\u2019s father\u2019s house, this time late at night. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to remove Qaddafi, he controls the West. In Tripoli the schools are open. Here, they are closed, the economy is in shambles. How long can we stay like this?\u201d\nOsama burst out in disagreement, saying Libyans had suffered too much under Qaddafi and would find a way to govern themselves. Fallah smiled contemptuously and got up to go.\n\u201cCome back in six months,\u201d he told me as he disappeared into the night. \u201cYou will see that I was right.\u201d",

    "text": "Wal-Mart to Announce Women-Friendly Plans\n2011-09-14T04:02:15.000Z\nWal-Mart planned to announce on Wednesday new programs aimed at helping women-owned businesses and women workers, as the company continues to deal with the possibility of individual claims of sex discrimination after the Supreme Court threw out a class-action suit by women workers this summer.\nIn an advance draft of the announcement, Wal-Mart said it planned to source a total of $20 billion in products from women-owned businesses in the United States over the next five years, which works out to an average of $4 billion a year, versus the $2.5 billion a year it currently spends, and to double what it buys from women-owned businesses globally by 2016.\nThe company said it would also support training of women in factories and farms that are Wal-Mart suppliers, donate $100 million to causes supporting women\u2019s economic development, and ask its vendors and services firms like ad agencies or public relations firms to increase gender and minority representation on their Wal-Mart accounts.\n\u201cIf you look at retail, the vast majority of our customers are women, and if you look at Wal-Mart, the majority of our associates are women,\u201d said Leslie A. Dach, executive vice president of corporate affairs for Wal-Mart, in an interview. \u201cIt makes complete sense for us to really have a focus on how we have the best associates we can, how we help women suppliers succeed and how we engage our communities.\u201d\nThe $5 billion a year that Wal-Mart plans to spend with women-owned businesses would still be a small percentage of Wal-Mart\u2019s overall budget. The $4 billion a year, on average, that Wal-Mart will spend sourcing from women in the United States works out to about 5 percent of the company\u2019s annual operating expenses.\n\u201cOver the course of the five years, we are going to both have to seek out the businesses that are there, and open ourselves up to that, and also we\u2019re going to help these businesses grow,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll range from construction to farming to food, and one of the great things about this is we will also improve the assortment of products we sell to people, and help our products become more relevant.\u201d\nMr. Dach said the announcement on Wednesday was not in reaction to the class-action suit against Wal-Mart, which charged unfair treatment of women in the workplace; the Supreme Court recently threw out the case. Some of the plaintiffs have said they will still try to sue the company through individual claims.\nBut some critics were quick to fault Wal-Mart\u2019s plans. Janet Shenk, a former A.F.L.-C.I.O. official, said its move to buy more products from women was a way of not dealing with problems.\n\u201cOnce again, Wal-Mart is avoiding every issue that touches on how its products are produced,\u201d said Ms. Shenk, who oversees some corporate grants at the Panta Rhea Foundation, which works to combat corporate influence. \u201cIt\u2019s not about who owns the factory. So far as I know, there\u2019s no evidence that factories and businesses owned by women treat their employees better or have better conditions than factories and businesses owned by men.\u201d\nYet CARE, a nonprofit development and relief agency, said Wal-Mart support would help advance its work.\n\u201cThe typical woman we work with is a woman working in an apparel factory in, say, Bangladesh,\u201d said Melanie Minzes, senior director for development at CARE. \u201cShe is probably illiterate, probably gets sick pretty easily because she doesn\u2019t have much health education. With Wal-Mart\u2019s commitment, we are going to be able to reach tens of thousands of women like her and improve their lives and economic positions. We will be able to teach them to read, how to address common abuses they face and what proper nutrition is, all things that will make her a better, healthier employee.\u201d\nWal-Mart has measured the gender and ethnic diversity at law firms that work for it since 2005. In the draft of Wednesday\u2019s announcement, it did not specify what new standards might be. Asked why there were no specifications, Mr. Dach said that \u201cit\u2019s important for us to be realistic about that as we make change \u2014 we\u2019re not asking anyone to turn over their work force, but we\u2019re confident that it will help us get results like it did in the legal field.\u201d\nAccording to the draft, Wednesday\u2019s announcement will be similar to ones Wal-Mart has made in the past several years outlining goals on locally sourced agriculture, addressing \u201cfood deserts\u201d in urban areas and reducing energy use.",

    "text": "Raiding a Brothel in India\n2011-05-26T01:09:38.000Z\nKOLKATA, India\nAt the beginning, I knew only about a young teenage girl imprisoned on the third floor of a brothel in a red-light district here in Kolkata. \nThe pimps nicknamed her Chutki, or little girl. She had just been sold to the brothel-owner and seemed terrified.\nInvestigators with International Justice Mission, a Washington-based aid group that fights human trafficking, had spotted Chutki while prowling undercover looking for prostituted children. I.J.M. hoped to convince the Kolkata police to free the girl, but it would help to have more evidence that the girl was still imprisoned. So an I.J.M. official asked: Would I like to accompany him as he sneaked into the brothel to gather evidence?\nIndia probably has more modern slaves than any country in the world. It has millions of women and girls in its brothels, often held captive for their first few years until they grow resigned to their fate. China surely has more prostitutes, but they are typically working voluntarily. India\u2019s brothels are also unusually violent, with ferocious beatings common and pimps sometimes even killing girls who are uncooperative.\nUnicef has estimated that worldwide 1.8 million children enter the sex trade each year. Too many are in the United States, which should prosecute pimps much more aggressively, but the worst abuses take place in countries like Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Cambodia.\nSo I set off with the I.J.M. investigator (who wants to remain anonymous for his own safety) into the alleys of the Sonagachi red-light district one evening, slipped into the brothel, and climbed to the third floor. And there were Chutki and three other girls in a room, a pimp hovering over them. Perceiving us as potential customers, he offered them to us.\nWe demurred but said we\u2019d be back.\nThe Kolkata police agreed to raid the brothel to free the girl. I.J.M. told them the location of the brothel at the last minute to avoid a tip-off from police ranks. The police casually asked us to lead the way in the raid since we knew what Chutki looked like and where she was kept.\nSo along with a carload of police, we drove up to the brothel and rushed inside to avoid giving the pimps time to hide Chutki or to escape themselves. With the I.J.M. representative in the lead, we hurtled up the stairs, brushed past the pimp and found Chutki and the three other girls in the same room where we had seen them before.\nTwo female social workers from I.J.M. immediately began comforting Chutki, who police said was about 15 and looked terrified. They explained that this was a police operation to rescue her, and they helped her put on a robe for modesty\u2019s sake.\nThen another of the girls in the room asked if she could be rescued \u2014 but a few days later. She explained that if she left now, the brothel-owners would blame her for the raid and possibly harm her grandmother, whose address they knew.\nWe told the girl that this chance might not come again. She dissolved into tears, wavered and then decided to come out. Then a third said that she wanted to escape as well. \nThe girls tipped off the police that the brothel-owner was in another building, arranging to sell a new girl named Raya for the very first time, either that evening or the next night. The police hurried off and returned with Raya, a wide-eyed girl of about 10 years.\nIt seemed that the brothel had purchased Raya just a week earlier, after her own brother-in-law tricked her and trafficked her. If the raid had been delayed by a few hours, she might have faced the first of many rapes.\nWith Raya was a 5-year-old girl who seemed to have been abandoned. Perhaps the brothel-owners were grooming her for sale in a few more years. So we emerged from the brothel with five lives that had just been transformed.\nEqually important, one pimp had been arrested and arrest warrants had been issued for two more. There are no quick fixes to human trafficking, but experience in several countries suggests that prosecuting pimps and brothel-owners makes a difference. A study in Cebu, Philippines, found that helping police and courts target child prostitution resulted in 87 arrests over four years \u2014 and a 79 percent reduction in the number of children in the sex trade.\nWe drove the five girls to a police station to fill out paperwork so that they could move into shelters and receive schooling or vocational training. Raya, the 10-year-old who otherwise at that moment might have been enduring her first rape, was giggly and carefree as she pretended to drive the car. She behaved like a silly little girl \u2014 which was thrilling. ",

    "text": "U.N. Forecasts 10.1 Billion People by Century\u2019s End\n2011-05-03T17:00:47.000Z\nThe population of the world, long expected to stabilize just above 9 billion in the middle of the century, will instead keep growing and may hit 10.1 billion by the year 2100, the United Nations projected in a report released Tuesday.\nGrowth in Africa remains so high that the population there could more than triple in this century, rising from today\u2019s one billion to 3.6 billion, the report said \u2014 a sobering forecast for a continent already struggling to provide food and water for its people.\nThe new report comes just ahead of a demographic milestone, with the world population expected to pass 7 billion in late October, only a dozen years after it surpassed 6 billion. Demographers called the new projections a reminder that a problem that helped define global politics in the 20th century, the population explosion, is far from solved in the 21st.\n\u201cEvery billion more people makes life more difficult for everybody \u2014 it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d said John Bongaarts, a demographer at the Population Council, a research group in New York. \u201cIs it the end of the world? No. Can we feed 10 billion people? Probably. But we obviously would be better off with a smaller population.\u201d\nThe projections were made by the United Nations population division, which has a track record of fairly accurate forecasts. In the new report, the division raised its forecast for the year 2050, estimating that the world would most likely have 9.3 billion people then, an increase of 156 million over the previous estimate for that year, published in 2008.\nAmong the factors behind the upward revisions is that fertility is not declining as rapidly as expected in some poor countries, and has shown a slight increase in many wealthier countries, including the United States, Britain and Denmark.\nThe director of the United Nations population division, Hania Zlotnik, said the world\u2019s fastest-growing countries, and the wealthy Western nations that help finance their development, face a choice about whether to renew their emphasis on programs that encourage family planning.\nThough they were a major focus of development policy in the 1970s and 1980s, such programs have stagnated in many countries, caught up in ideological battles over abortion, sex education and the role of women in society. Conservatives have attacked such programs as government meddling in private decisions, and in some countries, Catholic groups fought widespread availability of birth control. And some feminists called for less focus on population control and more on empowering women.\nOver the past decade, foreign aid to pay for contraceptives \u2014 $238 million in 2009 \u2014 has barely budged, according to United Nations estimates. The United States has long been the biggest donor, but the budget compromise in Congress last month cut international family planning programs by 5 percent.\n\u201cThe need has grown, but the availability of family planning services has not,\u201d said Rachel Nugent, an economist at the Center for Global Development in Washington, a research group.\nDr. Zlotnik said in an interview that the revised numbers were based on new forecasting methods and the latest demographic trends. But she cautioned that any forecast looking 90 years into the future comes with many caveats.\nThat is particularly so for some fast-growing countries whose populations are projected to skyrocket over the next century. For instance, Yemen, a country whose population has quintupled since 1950, to 25 million, would see its numbers quadruple again, to 100 million, by century\u2019s end, if the projections prove accurate. Yemen already depends on food imports and faces critical water shortages.\nIn Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, the report projects that population will rise from today\u2019s 162 million to 730 million by 2100. Malawi, a country of 15 million today, could grow to 129 million, the report projected.\nThe implicit, and possibly questionable, assumption behind these numbers is that food and water will be available for the billions yet unborn, and that potential catastrophes including climate change, wars or epidemics will not serve as a brake on population growth. \u201cIt is quite possible for several of these countries that are smallish and have fewer resources, these numbers are just not sustainable,\u201d Dr. Zlotnik said.\nWell-designed programs can bring down growth rates even in the poorest countries. Provided with information and voluntary access to birth-control methods, women have chosen to have fewer children in societies as diverse as Bangladesh, Iran, Mexico, Sri Lanka and Thailand.\nOne message from the new report is that the AIDS epidemic, devastating as it has been, has not been the demographic disaster that was once predicted. Prevalence estimates and projections for the human immunodeficiency virus made for Africa in the 1990s turned out to be too high, and in many populations, treatment with new drug regimens has cut the death rate from the disease.\nBut the survival of millions of people with AIDS who would have died without treatment, and falling rates of infant and child mortality \u2014 both heartening trends \u2014 also mean that fertility rates for women need to fall faster to curb population growth, demographers said.\nOther factors have slowed change in Africa, experts said, including women\u2019s lack of power in their relationships with men, traditions like early marriage and polygamy, and a dearth of political leadership. While about three-quarters of married American women use a modern contraceptive, the comparable proportions are a quarter of women in East Africa, one in 10 in West Africa, and a mere 7 percent in Central Africa, according to United Nations statistics.\n\u201cWest and Central Africa are the two big regions of the world where the fertility transition is happening, but at a snail\u2019s pace,\u201d said John F. May, a World Bank demographer.\nSome studies suggest that providing easy, affordable access to contraceptives is not always sufficient. A trial by Harvard researchers in Lusaka, Zambia, found that only when women had greater autonomy to decide whether to use contraceptives did they have significantly fewer children. Other studies have found that general education for girls plays a critical role, in that literate young women are more likely to understand that family size is a choice.\nThe new report suggests that China, which has for decades enforced restrictive population policies, could soon enter the ranks of countries with declining populations, peaking at 1.4 billion in the next couple of decades, then falling to 941 million by 2100.\nThe United States is growing faster than many rich countries, largely because of high immigration and higher fertility among Hispanic immigrants. The new report projects that the United States population will rise from today\u2019s 311 million to 478 million by 2100.",

    "text": "U.N. Pulls Staff from Sudanese City\n2011-06-12T19:13:11.000Z\nNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 The United Nations has begun pulling nonessential staff members from the restive Sudanese state of Southern Kordofan, even as it sends more peacekeepers there to protect civilians, officials said Sunday.\nMeanwhile, the Sudanese president, Omar al-Bashir, met with his southern counterpart, Salva Kiir, in Ethiopia, alongside Ethiopia\u2019s president and Thabo Mbeki, the former president of South Africa, to begin talks aimed at resolving the border dispute.\nHeavy fighting erupted in Kadugli, the capital of Southern Kordofan, a week ago, one of two border areas where the northern Sudanese government has deployed troops in recent weeks ahead of a planned split of north and south into separate countries next month.\nHumanitarian officials said Sunday that the situation in Kadugli was deteriorating. \n\u201cThe troop capacity is stretched to the limit,\u201d said Hua Jiang, a spokeswoman for the United Nations in Sudan. \u201cThe troops that we have there are not enough to secure the whole area.\u201d \nShe said a contingent of Bangladeshi peacekeepers had been brought to the region from elsewhere in the country. \nThe United Nations compound in Kadugli seemed to be at risk. A United Nations humanitarian official said that the compound had five days of food rations left, and a security report issued Saturday said the peacekeeping force \u201ccan no longer guarantee the safety of some of its national staff.\u201d\nThe report said that up to 60 staff members were stranded in central Kadugli, and the local government had not allowed the United Nations to take them to its compound on the city\u2019s outskirts. \nThousands of city residents have crowded a displaced persons camp near the compound. At least 6,000 were believed to be there on Sunday, and the protection was said to be spotty.\nUnited Nations officials said they could not rule out reports that people had been abducted from the camp.\nA report by the United Nations humanitarian agency, dated Friday, said security officers in Kadugli had seen two trucks of blindfolded men being transported. It was not clear who the men were, where they were being taken or by whom.\nAt the same time, the United Nations has been trying to evacuate its own personnel. \nOn Saturday, a convoy of vehicles carrying nonessential international staff members was forced to turn around, United Nations officials said, when northern Sudanese soldiers stopped the vehicles and the Egyptian peacekeepers assigned to protect them abandoned the convoy.\nA convoy with 30 international staff members is to try again to leave Kadugli on Monday.\nEvacuating local staff members has faced other obstacles. The northern Sudanese government had prohibited all Sudanese citizens working with the United Nations from leaving.\nOn Saturday, the United Nations moved about 80 percent of its Sudanese staff out of Kadugli secretly, using commercial vehicles, according to a security report. There are approximately 380 United Nations staff members in Kadugli, a public information officer said.\nOver the last several days, fighting in Southern Kordofan \u2014 a northern Sudanese state with a large and militarized population aligned with southern Sudan \u2014 has spread to more than half of the state.\nSince the fighting began on June 5, humanitarian officials estimate at least 40,000 people have fled Kadugli, a city surrounded by the Nuba Mountains, where thousands of ethnically African locals, aligned toward southern Sudan, remain armed.\nThe Nubans fought alongside the ethnically African southern Sudanese during their decades-long civil war with the predominantly Arab north. But while southern Sudan is scheduled to declare independence on July 9, in accord with a 2005 American-brokered peace agreement, Southern Kordofan and neighboring Blue Nile State will remain part of the north. \nThe northern Sudanese army invaded the contested border region of Abyei last month, forcing nearly 100,000 southern Sudanese to flee.",

    "text": "The Hated and the Hater, Both Touched by Crime\n2011-07-19T00:47:48.000Z\nMark Anthony Stroman, 41, a stonecutter from Dallas, shot people he believed were Arabs, saying he was enraged by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. He killed at least two: Vasudev Patel, an Indian immigrant who was Hindu, and Waqar Hasan, a Muslim born in Pakistan.\nA third shooting victim, Rais Bhuiyan, 37, a former Air Force pilot from Bangladesh, survived after Mr. Stroman shot him in the face at close range. Mr. Stroman admitted to the shootings. He is scheduled to be executed on Wednesday.\nMr. Bhuiyan, despite being partly blinded in his right eye, has spent the past several months creating a Web site with a petition and meeting with officials in Texas to try to persuade the state to spare Mr. Stroman.\nMr. Bhuiyan was interviewed over the phone. Mr. Stroman responded to questions in a typewritten letter dated June 26 that included a photograph of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001: smoke is seen billowing out of the North Tower and United Airlines Flight 175 is moments away from striking the South Tower. The ellipses in his answers are his.\nQ Mr. Bhuiyan, you were working as a clerk at a friend\u2019s service station on Sept. 21, 2001. What do you remember?\nA I was robbed a couple of times. It was a dangerous neighborhood. People would come into the store to sell televisions and computers. One time a man came with a gun and I thought he wanted to sell it to make money. He said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t give me money I will blow your head off.\u201d On Sept. 21, it was Friday around 12:30 in the afternoon. Business was slow. It was raining cats and dogs. The neighbor from the barber shop had come in and brought chips and drinks. Then there\u2019s a guy coming into the store with a hat and sunglasses and a bandanna and a gun in his hand. I thought it was a robbery. I said, \u201cDon\u2019t shoot me please. Take all the money.\u201d He said, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d He was four or five feet away from me. I felt cold air in my spine. I said, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d It was a double-barrel gun. I felt a million bee stings on my face at the same time. Then I heard an explosion. I saw images of my parents, my siblings and my fianc\u00e9e and then a graveyard and I thought, \u201cAm I dying today?\u201d I looked down and saw blood was pouring from my head. I placed both my hands on my head to get my brains in and I screamed, \u201cMom!\u201d I looked and he was still staring at me and I thought he might shoot me again if I don\u2019t fall and he doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m dead. The floor was getting wet with my blood. Then he left the store. I could not believe he shot me. I thought I was dreaming, going through a hallucination. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I was not a threat to him. I couldn\u2019t believe someone would just shoot you like that.\nQ What happened next?\nA I wanted to go outside. I went to the barber shop and they ran away. They saw me full of blood running like a slaughtered chicken and they thought the guy was behind me. I saw my face in the barbershop mirror and I couldn\u2019t believe it was me. (He begins to cry). A few minutes before, I had been a young guy in a T-shirt and shorts and tennis shoes. (He begins to cry more forcefully). Sorry, I haven\u2019t cried for the past nine years. I was lucky because there was an ambulance in the area. I was asking God, asking for forgiveness, saying I would do my best. Reciting verses from the Koran. I said I would dedicate my life to the poor. I felt my eyes were closing and it felt like my brain was shutting down slowly.\nQ What was the extent of your injuries?\nA There were 38 pellets in my face. I couldn\u2019t open my eyes or talk or open my jaw. I couldn\u2019t even eat or drink anything. It was very painful to even swallow because I was shot in my throat. After a few hours in the hospital I could open my left eye. My face was heavily swollen. There were gunshot wounds. My face was horrible. I couldn\u2019t believe it was my face. I prayed, \u201cPlease God, give me my face back.\u201d ( Mr. Bhuiyan was discharged the day after being treated; he was told he did not have health insurance. For the next several months, he slept on people\u2019s couches and had to rely on physicians\u2019 samples for medication, including painkillers and eye drops. He had several operations on his right eye; he now has only limited vision in it.)\nQ Mr. Stroman has admitted trying to kill you. Why are you trying to save his life?\nA I was raised very well by my parents and teachers. They raised me with good morals and strong faith. They taught me to put yourself in others\u2019 shoes. Even if they hurt you, don\u2019t take revenge. Forgive them. Move on. It will bring something good to you and them. My Islamic faith teaches me this too. He said he did this as an act of war and a lot of Americans wanted to do it but he had the courage to do it \u2014 to shoot Muslims. After it happened I was just simply struggling to survive in this country. I decided that forgiveness was not enough. That what he did was out of ignorance. I decided I had to do something to save this person\u2019s life. That killing someone in Dallas is not an answer for what happened on Sept. 11.\nQ If you had the chance to meet Mr. Stroman, what would you say to him?\nA I requested a meeting with Mr. Stroman. I\u2019m eagerly awaiting to see him in person and exchange ideas. I would talk about love and compassion. We all make mistakes. He\u2019s another human being, like me. Hate the sin, not the sinner. It\u2019s very important that I meet him to tell him I feel for him and I strongly believe he should get a second chance. That I never hated the U.S. He could educate a lot of people. Thinking about what is going to happen makes me very emotional. I can\u2019t sleep. Once I go to bed I feel there is another person that I know who is in his bed thinking about what is going to happen to him \u2014 that he is going to be tied to a bed and killed. It makes me very emotional and very sad and makes me want to do more.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nQ How are you doing, Mr. Stroman?\nA \u201ci\u2019ve only 25 days left until Texas Straps Me to a Gurney and pumps me full of toxic bug juice, But then again, we all face an Ending at some time or another. All is well, Spirits are high, i sit here with a Cup of Coffee and some Good ole Classic Rock playing on My radio, how Ironic, the song \u2018Free Bird\u2019 by Lynyrd Skynyrd...\u201d\nQ What do you think of Rais Bhuiyan\u2019s efforts to keep you from being executed?\nA \u201cYes, Mr Rais Bhuiyan, what an inspiring soul...for him to come forward after what ive done speaks Volume\u2019s...and has really Touched My heart and the heart of Many others World Wide...Especially since for the last 10 years all we have heard about is How Evil the Islamic faith Can be...its proof that all are Not bad nor Evil.\u201d\nQ Tell me what you are thinking now, a few weeks before your scheduled execution.\nA \u201cNot only do I have all My friends and supporters trying to Save my Life, but now i have The Islamic Community Joining in...Spearheaded by one Very Remarkable man Named Rais Bhuiyan, Who is a Survivor of My Hate. His deep Islamic Beliefs Have gave him the strength to Forgive the Un-forgiveable...that is truly Inspiring to me, and should be an Example for us all. The Hate, has to stop, we are all in this world together. My jesus Faith & Texas Roots have Deepened My Understanding as well. Its almost been 10 years since The world stopped Turning, and we as a nation will never be able to forget what we felt that day, I surely wont, but I can tell you what im feeling Today, and that\u2019s very grateful for Rais Bhuiyan\u2019s Efforts to save my life after I tried to end His. A lot of people out There are still hurt and full of hate, and as I Sit here On Texas Death watch counting down to my Own Death, I have been given the chance to openly Express whats inside this Texas Mind and heart, and hopefully that something good will come of this. We need More Forgiveness and Understanding and less hate.\u201d Mr. Stroman signed off, \u201cTexas Loud & Texas proud...TRUE AMERICAN.... Living to Die \u2013 Dying to Live.\u201d",

    "text": "Bahrain Blowback\n2011-02-16T13:03:13.000Z\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Where\u2019s the next place to blow in the Arab revolution? Candidates are many, but there\u2019s one whose geopolitical impact vastly exceeds its diminutive size \u2014 the island of Bahrain. \nThis is a place run by an oppressive and corrupt little regime, long coddled by Washington because the U.S. Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet is headquartered there. The future of the base is far from secure if the regime falls.\nA few hard facts about the island that should give pause for thought:\nFirst, Bahrain is a Shiite island. You won\u2019t see it described that way, but it is \u2014 70 percent of the population, more than the percentage of Shiites in Iraq. And like Iraq under Saddam Hussein, these Arab Shiites have been systematically discriminated against, repressed, and denied meaningful roles by a Sunni tribal government determined to maintain its solid grip on the country. The emergence of real democracy, as in Iraq, will push the country over into the Shiite column \u2014 sending shivers down the spines of other Gulf rulers, and especially in Riyadh.\nAppearances are deceiving. Go to Bahrain and on the surface you won\u2019t feel the same heavy hand that dominates so many other Arab authoritarian states. The island is liberal in its social freedoms. Expats feel at home \u2014 you can get a drink, go to nightclubs, go to the beach, party. \n But if you look behind the Western and elite-populated high-rises you\u2019ll encounter the Shiite ghettoes \u2014 poor and neglected, with high unemployment, walls smeared with anti-regime graffiti.\nFree market? Sure, except the regime imports politically neutered laborers from passive, apolitical states that need the money: Filipinos, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans and other South Asians who won\u2019t make waves or they\u2019re on the next plane out. \nThe regime also imports its thugs. The ranks of the police are heavily staffed with expat police who often speak no Arabic, have no attachments to the country and who will beat, jail, torture and shoot Bahraini protestors with impunity. \nLike other Shiite populations, clerics figure heavily among the leaders. But many are liberal and open, reflecting the culturally open character of the island. Most Bahraini Shiites would look to Ayatollah Sistani in Iraq rather than to Iran for religious guidance. \nTypically, however, just like most other tyrants across the region, the al-Khalifa regime in Bahrain will whip up anti-Shiite, anti-Iranian fears to gain Western backing \u2014 and they usually get it. \nIt\u2019s not just that the majority is Shiite. From a Saudi perspective, the Bahraini Shiites maintain close family and cultural ties with Shiite families across the water in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Shiite minority, probably even more oppressed, is already restive and would be responsive to Shiite political unrest nearby. This is Riyadh\u2019s ultimate nightmare \u2014 a further strengthening of Shiite political power in this oil-rich region. \nThe Sunni minority of Bahrain is in a difficult position. The Sunnis worry about the rise of the Shiite majority that makes up the oppressed class. But liberal Sunnis are also highly discontent with the al-Khalifa regime and seek political reform. Many work with the Shiite leadership to attain secular reforms, but the regime has repressed them as well and fans fear of Shiites to help keep them in line.\nThere has been relatively little actual blood shed \u2014 at least compared to Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran and other neighboring states \u2014 in the decades-long story of Shiite resistance to the authoritarian ruling family. If the al-Khalifa thugs are let loose, that could change quickly. The temperature is rising.\nWashington is now faced again with another hard choice \u2014 the legacy of shortsighted decisions made over decades: Continue to go with local repressive regimes out of a misguided sense of \u201cAmerican interests\u201d? Hold on to unpopular military bases at all costs \u2014 thereby deepening local anger and perhaps giving Iran ultimately a greater voice in events? \nOr should it quietly drop support for this repressive regime, allow events to take their course and accept that long-overdue change is coming? How long can we hold on to another ugly status quo? It\u2019s really about how bad the change will get the longer we wait.\n  Graham E. Fuller,  former vice-chairman of the National Intelligence Council at the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, is adjunct professor of history at Simon Fraser University. His latest book is \u201cA World Without Islam.\u201d  ",

    "text": "A.C. Milan Hopes New Soccer Season Continues Like Last\n2011-09-08T11:39:13.000Z\n The outstanding matchups  this weekend in soccer  \n Friday \n A.C. Milan vs. Lazio \nThe champion A.C. Milan finally kicks off the Italian season at the San Siro, a day ahead of the rest but still two weeks late following the habitual players\u2019 dispute with the league.\nLosing just once in Serie A in 2011, Milan expects to go one better than its last three games against Lazio, all draws. Two things do not help: Five injured Milan players, including Robinho and Mark van Bommel, and a looming visit to Barcelona in the Champions League on Tuesday. Still, an attack of Pato and Zlatan Ibrahimovic looks more potent than canny Lazio can afford.\n  \n Saturday \n Arsenal vs. Swansea  \nArsenal\u2019s response to its loss of the century, 8-2 at Manchester United before the international break, was to buy in all departments \u2014 defense, midfield and attack. The new striker, Park Chu-young of South Korea, arrived drained after World Cup qualification duty in Kuwait, but Mikel Arteta, the closest thing Arsenal could find to replace Cesc F\u00e0bregas, is fit and fresh for the challenge.\nThe opponent, Swansea, has arrived in the Premiership ahead of schedule, and while pleasing to the eye, has yet to score after three games in the top flight.\n Real Madrid vs. Getafe; Real Sociedad vs. Barcelona \nThe big guns in most European leagues play Saturday because of the Champions League next week. In Spain\u2019s case, the claims of financial inequality get ever louder as six La Liga clubs operate under bankruptcy protection while Madrid and Barcelona, with their separate TV income, make the title a two-horse race from start to finish.\nOf the two this weekend, Bar\u00e7a has the harder task, a trip to San Sebasti\u00e1n in Basque country. Yet, before the two-week break, Barcelona had beaten one of the best of the rest, Villarreal, 5-0 with an injury-depleted lineup that contained only one genuine defender, \u00c9ric Abidal.\nThe star performer, Lionel Messi, returns from a most exotic junket, two games for Argentina in India and Bangladesh. \n  \n Sunday \n Juventus vs. Parma \nArguably the new beginning of this weekend. La Vecchia Signora, the Old Lady, as Juventus is known, makes a fresh start in a new home, with more new sons in one summer than most clubs get to sign in a decade.\nThe stadium might be the star. It is something that Italian soccer has been lacking in comparison to England, Germany and Spain because, while big clubs in those leagues have huge income streams from owning their own stadiums, even the Serie A giants have paid rent to municipal stadiums.\nJuve was particularly unhappy in its Stadio delle Alpi. Built on the outskirts of the city for the 1990 World Cup \u2014 and with the field built too far from the stands, with an eight-lane running track between field and fans \u2014 the stadium was damned by supporters, and even the club owner, Gianni Agnelli, as soulless.\nJuventus bought it, demolished it, and under Agnelli\u2019s nephew, Andrea Agnelli, as president, now moves into a proper soccer stadium, seating 41,000, and with all modern streams of income, including luxury boxes.\nFor such a makeover, the club\u2019s new coach, the former midfielder Antonio Conte, has been handed an almost completely renovated squad, hoping at last to put behind it the scandal of 2006 that temporarily demoted the Old Lady.\nSince the end of last season, the club has made 15 signings, spending almost half as much on flesh and blood as on the \u20ac100 million stadium.\nSomeone old (or at least well-established), Andrea Pirlo switched clubs, leaving A.C. Milan for the new Juve. \nSomeone younger, the darting Dutch winger Eljero Elia, cost \u20ac10 million to acquire from Hamburg. \nAnd someone who has never left Juventus, the club captain, Alessandro del Piero, starts his latest season in his fourth Juventus stadium.\nAll it needs now is class on the field. \u201cThere are better and more competitive leagues than ours,\u201d Pirlo admitted this summer. \u201cWe have had a major drop in quality.\u201d",

    "text": "Libyan Refugee Crisis Called a \u2018Logistical Nightmare\u2019\n2011-03-03T09:45:00.000Z\nRAS AJDIR BORDER CROSSING, Tunisia \u0097 Thousands of stranded immigrant workers fleeing Libya\u2019s violence stood huddled together at this desolate outpost on Thursday evening, braced silently against a whipping, sandy wind, hoping they would not spend the night outside. Then the doors of a bus opened, shouts went up and the crowd swarmed \u0097 men and women surging frantically, their overstuffed suitcases balanced precariously on their heads as they ran.\nEven as an international airlift began repatriating workers, and as governments and aid agencies began to mobilize in earnest to stem a potential humanitarian crisis here, there were still not enough buses to move people to refugee camps or, for the lucky ones, to waiting planes and ships to take them home. Nor was there enough food, tents or toilets for the tens of thousands waiting here on the Tunisian border. \nAnt\u00f3nio Guterres, the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, who said the numbers of workers able to leave Tunisia were still being dwarfed by the number of those pouring in, called the situation \u201ca logistical nightmare.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been very lucky,\u201d said Ripon Das, 33, a Bangladeshi construction worker who fled Tripoli. This was his third night outside on the Tunisian side of the border crossing, Mr. Das said. He had spent two nights waiting at the border in Libya before that. He said that \u201cgangsters\u201d had repeatedly held him up at knifepoint, stealing his money and that soldiers had confiscated and destroyed his cellphone.\nHe still does not know how he will make his way home.\nFor days, Tunisia \u0097 which is itself still grappling with the aftermath of a revolt that deposed its long-time leader \u0097 has been overwhelmed with refugees, raising alarm among the international aid community. More than half of the estimated 180,000 people fleeing Libya in the past 11 days have sought refuge in Tunisia.\nThose who cross here at Ras Ajdir are taken to a hastily built refugee camp about four miles away, which has room for about 10,000 people and is overflowing.\nAn estimated 20,000 to 30,000 refugees are now here and at the camp. \nTens of thousands are thought to remain on Libyan side, as well, according to an estimate by the International Medical Corps, an aid organization. \nHelp appears to be on the way from Europe and the United States, which have committed to rescue efforts. Most of those who remain behind are from countries in Asia and Africa that do not have the wherewithal to evacuate them.\nBut it will take time to set up the huge rescue effort, and conditions here are bad enough that the World Health Organization warned Thursday of the risk of epidemics. Aid workers and officials have begun wearing protective masks and latex gloves.\nMany of those who have made it here consider themselves lucky, but some are haunted by the knowledge that other migrants remain trapped by the fighting.\nSpeaking to a visitor, one elderly Egyptian in a turban and a flowing robe began denouncing the violence in Libya. A younger man interrupted: \u201cStop, uncle, don\u2019t talk about that. There are still Egyptians in Libya!\u201d\nA former construction worker in Tripoli, the younger man said he did not want Libyan forces to single out Egyptians because of critical comments about the country.\nAfter days of chaos and increasingly urgent calls for help, international agencies were working to develop plans for dealing with the fallout from Libya\u2019s turmoil long term. The World Food Program said Thursday it was beginning a $38.7 million operation to feed up to 2.7 million people in Tunisia, Egypt, where many immigrant workers have fled, and Libya itself.\nThe European Union also committed almost $42 million in aid to address the refugee crisis on Libya\u2019s borders. \nThe number of countries willing to bring workers from other nations to their home countries also grew. Many of those refugees are Egyptians, who fled to Tunisia rather than to the Egyptian border because they started their journeys in Tripoli, in the west. \nPresident Obama announced that he had approved the use of military and civilian aircraft to take workers from several nations home, including to Egypt, which is struggling to recover from political upheaval.\nBritish officials said Thursday that 800 Egyptians had been flown out of Tunisia on planes chartered by the British government and that the plan was to increase that number to 2,000 a day.\nThe German foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, announced that Berlin would send three naval vessels to take 4,000 Egyptians back to their country, joining the broader European effort to stem a humanitarian crisis here. The region has long been a springboard for illegal immigration into southern Europe, and Italy and other countries have asked for help in avoiding what on Italian official called a possible \u201cbiblical exodus.\u201d A French amphibious assault ship is expected in Tunisia Saturday to help ferry more Egyptians home. \nOn Thursday night, small groups of men continued to shuffle across the blustery no man\u2019s land between Tunisia and Libya, up to a battered, white-washed guard post here at Ras Ajdir.\n The Tunisian National Guard lieutenant in command of the post, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns, said his country would do its best to help those fleeing. \n\u201cEither there are a lot, or there are just a few, we don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just welcome them.\u201d",

    "text": "Flying the Flag, Fleeing the State\n2011-04-25T00:08:16.000Z\nLeeds, England\nFOUR American yachters killed; a Danish family of five and two crew members kidnapped: these events in the space of a week early this year may finally fuel a consensus that something needs to be done about piracy in the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden. And something should be done: in addition to the yachters, nearly 700 sailors, mostly Filipino, Bangladeshi and Russian, are being held hostage. Often forced to operate their captured ships at gunpoint, with little food or water, some of them have been prisoners for months.\nBut maritime lawlessness isn\u2019t confined to pirates. Thanks to a system of ship registration called \u201cflags of convenience,\u201d it is all too easy for unscrupulous ship owners to get away with criminal behavior. They have evaded prosecution for environmental damage like oil spills, as well as poor labor conditions, forcing crews to work like slaves without adequate pay or rest. But unlike piracy, which seems intractable, the appalling conditions on some merchant ships could be stopped.\nShips used to fly the flags of their nation. They were floating pieces of their home country on ungovernable seas, with all the advantages and disadvantages of government oversight: if things went wrong, seafarers were protected by their governments. If they did wrong, they could be punished.\nBut in the early 20th century, this began to change. Panama, seeking to attract American ships avoiding Prohibition laws, allowed non-Panamanians to fly its flag, for a fee. Liberia and other countries followed suit. Today these \u201copen registries\u201d are used by over 60 percent of shippers, up from 4 percent in the 1950s.\nUnder the flags of convenience system, registries have been divorced from government oversight. North Korea has a thriving registry, as does landlocked Mongolia. Liberia\u2019s registry, the second-largest in the world, flourished even during a dozen years of civil war. Some registries allow ship owners to change the flags they\u2019re registered under within 48 hours; some require little more than a signature or an online form from an owner. Many don\u2019t require owners to disclose their identities at all.\nSuch easy anonymity is dangerous.\nIn 1999, a oil tanker called the Erika sank off Brittany and polluted 250 miles of French coastline. The French government could not penetrate a chain of shell companies in seven countries that stood between the ship and its owner. The owner eventually came forward voluntarily and, when questioned by the BBC about the complex ownership arrangements, said, \u201cThat is standard practice in shipping.\u201d\nIt shouldn\u2019t be.\nMany state registries lack the capacity or will to monitor the safety and working conditions on ships, or to investigate accidents. Instead, ship safety certificates are given out by private classification societies. Owners are allowed to choose which society they want \u2014 and the worst predictably choose the least demanding. This self-policing has been compared to registering a car in Bali so you can drive it in Australia with faulty brakes.\nThe human cost of this system is unacceptably high. Long hours and punishing port schedules rarely provide sailors with enough time to rest; some international regulations permit 98-hour work weeks.\nSalaries often go unpaid: the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation, which represents seafarers, recovered $30 million in unpaid wages last year. When the Most Sky, a Turkish ship registered in Panama, docked at a British port last November, its crew had not been paid for months. They had to pool together enough money to buy bread and there was no light or heat in their cabin; they had been using a kebab grill to keep warm.\nThere are plenty of ships run by decent owners. But delinquency is too easy with open registries, when owners can slip away, unpunished and unaccountable.\nThe world of merchant shipping is undeniably complex. Nearly half of all crews today are made up of four or more nationalities. On a container ship I sailed on for five weeks last summer, I sat in the officers\u2019 mess next to a Burmese engineer, opposite a Romanian and a Moldovan. The men at the table behind us were Chinese, Filipino and Scottish. The crew mess next door was entirely Filipino. We had a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II on the wall. They had better cookies and a microwave with two settings: Ramen for One and Ramen for Two.\nBut globalization is no reason that states can\u2019t take responsibility for the ships they register. On paper, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea specifies there should be a \u201cgenuine link\u201d between the ship and its flag. But debate continues over what that link should be. At the least, it should involve a state\u2019s being able to carry out effective inspections and monitoring of its ships, rather than tolerating online application forms and no questions asked. Even if the United Nations defined a link, though, it\u2019s not clear that its members would be willing or able to enforce it when flags of convenience are so profitable for both states and ship owners, who stand to save millions of dollars a year in wages and taxes.\nA more immediate, if partial, solution would be for port authorities, which have the power to detain unsafe or abusive ships that dock in their harbors, to pay extra attention to ships registered under notoriously lax states, like the Comoros. To avoid this extra scrutiny and the possibility of detention fees, ships might pressure the registries to raise their standards.\nFinally, public scrutiny can\u2019t hurt. We boycott food produced by companies that mistreat their workers, but know little about the sometimes atrocious conditions on the ships that carry the food. A campaign called Save Our Seafarers, organized by unions and shippers to raise awareness about piracy, may also cast light on the industry\u2019s own failings.\nBut the crew members on my ship, who lived in superior standards compared with many, didn\u2019t have much hope. \u201cNo one cares about the merchant navy,\u201d the captain said over dinner one night. \u201cWe are the scum of the earth. Always have been, always will be.\u201d And with that, he returned to his soup.",

    "text": "U.A.E. Construction Workers Stranded, With No Pay and No Prospects\n2011-02-09T21:54:24.000Z\nDUBAI \u2014 Every day, Dr. Devenapally Shashikala rises before dawn to prepare food for an army of men who have come to depend on her support.\nAfter finishing work at a small medical practice in Karama, an area famous in Dubai for fake goods shops, Dr. Shashikala tours abandoned villas and parks across the United Arab Emirates, where men stranded after falling victim to the financial crisis, sleep rough for the night.\nAlong with a group of helpers, she feeds them, clothes them and counsels them. \u201cThey\u2019re depressed,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re jobless and shelterless. The situation is the same all over the U.A.E.\u201d \nThe plight of laid-off construction workers was raised in a recent report by Human Rights Watch, a rights advocacy organization based in New York.\nThe report said that during the course of last year \u201chundreds of laid-off migrant workers were stranded in labor camps without electricity or running water for months on end after their Dubai-based employers closed; some had to fight off rats while sleeping amid garbage heaps.\u201d \nBut is it not only the unemployed who are suffering. The emirate\u2019s financial woes, which led to the cancellation of hundreds of building projects, have left contractors unable to pay the workers they have kept on.\nThis is despite the introduction of regulations that came into force in 2009 stipulating that private sector employers must pay salaries into bank accounts. Under these rules failure to pay on time can be punished by fines of up to 10,000 dirhams, or about $2,700, and the imposition of restrictions on hiring.\nThe rules were a response to a series of protests over nonpayment of salaries during the construction boom.\nStill, \u201csome contractors are not paying salaries for five or six months,\u201d said K. Kumar, who works on behalf of the Indian Community Welfare Committee. \nThe contractors are \u201csometimes helpless after not being paid by developers,\u201d Mr. Kumar noted. \u201cBut the bottom line is the workers are suffering. Also, utilities aren\u2019t being paid so camps are cut off from water and electricity; people are left in a bad situation.\u201d \nIn response to the Human Rights Watch report, a statement by the Emirates Labor Ministry rebuffed what it termed the organization\u2019s \u201csensational\u201d reporting. It said the plight of workers laid off from their jobs last year, at a time of widespread unemployment because of the global economic downturn, \u201cwas for the overwhelming part dealt with in an orderly fashion and workers continue to enjoy wage protection under an internationally acclaimed electronic Wage Protection System.\u201d\nA spokesman from the ministry was unavailable for further comment.\nDr. Shashikala set up her support group in 2007, when the building boom was at its peak and thousands of workers from the Indian subcontinent were being lured to the Emirates by rogue recruitment agents, who promised employment in return for an extortionate fee.\nAfter handing over their passports for supposed visa purposes the workers never saw them again, ending up trapped in the country without a job or shelter, she said.\nMost took out loans of up to $4,000 to pay the agent, a debt they often are still struggling to repay. Others became illegal when they absconded from their employers.\nEven though 279,000 undocumented migrants took advantage of an Emirates government amnesty to leave the country in late 2007, many chose to stay, legalizing their status.\nThey came mainly from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka and stayed in the hope of earning enough money to send some back to their families and pay off their debts.\n\u201cBut even in the boom, a lot of people worked for companies who paid low wages, or were not paying them at all,\u201d said Joseph Bobby, a co-founder of The Valley of Love, a charity set up in 1998 to help migrant workers.\n Many of the men are now also burdened with huge credit card debt, a throwback to the days of easy credit, Mr. Kumar, of the Indian welfare committee, said.\n\u201cBanks were keen to market their products during the boom. I know people who managed to get eight cards,\u201d he said.\nTheir luck worsened toward the end of 2008, when the financial crisis led to thousands of jobs being cut across the construction sector.\nMany workers were unable to retrieve passports, which had been confiscated by former employers who, citing \u201csecurity reasons,\u201d ignored laws making it illegal to withhold the passports.\nThere are no official figures for the number of undocumented workers now in the U.A.E.. Mr. Bobby said his charity helped to repatriate hundreds of illegal Indians last year, after the Indian Consulate issued emergency certificates to replace missing passports.\nBut even though the one-way tickets, or \u201coutpasses,\u201d are available for all illegal migrants, many have chosen to stay, and so resort to scratching around for a living, he said.\nHow many is anybody\u2019s guess. One social worker, who asked not to be named because the issue remains politically sensitive, offered an estimate of about 8,000.\nTheir plight is visible in dusty car parks across the United Arab Emirates, where many have turned to cleaning the sports cars and utility vehicles of the rich. They earn as much as the car\u2019s owner chooses to give them, which often is little more than $1, the social worker said.\nThe overall situation has improved over the last three or four months, \u201cas a lot of people have been repatriated,\u201d Mr. Bobby said. \u201cBut still, there are many who want to stay, so they do bits of work here or there.\u201d \nThe struggle for survival has led to many ending up in hospital, he added. Mr. Bobby and his team of volunteers routinely visit patients and assist with medical payments.\n\u201cThey have a lack of food and water; some cannot pay for a room so they might sleep in the park, and so the health issues are there,\u201d he said. \nAlcohol addiction is also an issue, with most of the little money they do earn being spent on bootleg alcohol, social workers say. That, together with their desperate situation, takes its toll on mental health, said Dr. Shashikala. \n\u201cThey have serious financial problems,\u201d she said. \u201cI try to counsel them, or get them to stop drinking.\u201d \nBut for all her efforts, some cases lead to suicide. The situation has also prompted a rise in petty crime, said Ali Abdulla Al Shamsi, an advocate and legal consultant at Al Shamsi & Partners.\n\u201cThey\u2019re working without permission, they\u2019re doing trade in alcohol, and they\u2019re doing fake passports to get home,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a place to stay or eat. The crime is related to companies not paying salaries.\u201d \nAs a result, unrest among the underprivileged immigrant work force persists in the Emirates. In January, 5,000 men working for Arabtec Construction, which helped to build Burj Khalifa, the tallest tower in the world, went on strike for a $55 pay rise from their current average monthly salary of $217.\nMr. Bobby said that while the cost of living has risen rapidly, salaries in the construction industry have hardly changed since the late 1990s, with some workers earning as little at $163 a month. The economic downturn has also meant cutbacks in the amount that workers can earn through overtime.\nStill, protests are illegal in the country and the authorities responded by deporting 71 Bangladeshis who were identified as strike instigators. The deportation was announced on the same day that Human Rights Watch released its report.\n\u201cPrices of necessities have risen,\u201d said Samer Muscati, the U.A.E. researcher for Human Rights Watch.\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t work overtime, they\u2019re not able to pay debts and send money home.\u201d Meanwhile, in May last year, hundreds of workers marched from their labor camp in Sharjah, a neighboring emirate, to the Ministry of Labor in Dubai, demanding to be paid their salaries and sent home.\n\u201cThe workers said that they were living in squalor and that their employer had not paid them in six months,\u201d the Human Rights Watch report said.\n\u201cThe ministry liquidated the company\u2019s assets to pay the workers and buy their flight tickets,\u201d it said. \u201cHowever, many went home with just a portion of their wages, while others received nothing at all.\u201d \nWhile the unrest is a concern, experts do not feel the low-paid immigrant work force will take inspiration from recent events in Tunisia and Egypt and hold a mass protest, purely because of the ramifications, such as being deported.\n\u201cThe protests and riots are worrying, but most seem to be focused on just getting paid, getting better working conditions, or simply getting home,\u201c said Christopher Davidson, a professor in Middle East politics at Durham University in Britain. \u201cI doubt there are any political overtones, and as such the workers will be of no interest or use to the genuine opposition movements in the Gulf states. As in Egypt and Tunisia, these are largely young, educated, Internet-savvy nationals who are fed up autocratic structures, lack of transparency, and human rights violations.\u201d \nDespite the continuing problems, the U.A.E. has in fact made some strides toward improving the conditions of low-paid migrant workers.\nIn January, the Ministry of Labor announced regulations to curb exploitative agents who entrap foreign workers with recruiting fees and false contracts.\nHuman Rights Watch said this \u201csignals an extremely positive commitment to address one of the country\u2019s most glaring human rights problems \u2014 the abuse of migrant construction workers.\u201d \n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely been an improvement since 2006, especially on the legal side,\u201d Mr. Muscati added. \u201cBut these moves need enforcement, and that\u2019s what we haven\u2019t seen much of.\u201d",

    "text": "On Ship of Evacuees From Libya, Harrowing Tales\n2011-04-18T17:53:08.000Z\nABOARD THE IONIAN SPIRIT, off Libya \u2014 More than 900 migrant workers were evacuated by sea overnight Sunday from the besieged Libyan port city of Misurata, one further step in the international effort to rescue thousands of foreigners stranded within Libya after the rebellion began.\nThe rescued workers, ferried to safety in the rebel capital of Benghazi on a tourist vessel, carried with them little beyond harrowing accounts of their weeks in limbo beside a nearly abandoned port, and a collective sense of relief to be out of the war\u2019s path.\nThe conditions they left behind were dire. Misurata, Libya\u2019s third largest city, continued to be the scene of intensive, close-quarters fighting between forces loyal to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and the city\u2019s anti-Qaddafi rebels. It also faced barrages of mortar and rocket fire from Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s troops.\nAs the fighting raged, as many as 5,000 migrant workers remained trapped within the city, according to Jeremy R. A. Haslam, the team leader for the International Organization for Migration, which chartered the vessel that entered the port for a second time to collect foreigners trying to flee.\nThe city also was at risk of losing more of its already limited medical support. Misurata, like much of Libya, has relied for years on foreign medical workers to help staff its hospitals. Much of that staff has already left. And foreign nurses aboard the vessel said that many more planned to go soon.\nProspects for further evacuations were unclear. Mr. Haslam said the crew of the Ionian Spirit, worried that Misurata was too dangerous, was threatening not to return for another evacuation. \u201cThey think they are pushing their luck with a third trip,\u201d he said.\nCompounding the unease was an evident sense of distrust between crew members and the cruise line operating the ship. \u201cI am sure I do not want to go back,\u201d said a crew member on the vessel. The crew member, who asked not to be identified because he feared retaliation, said that the crew had not been told they would travel to a war zone, and that many of the ship\u2019s company remained on the vessel only because they were owed back pay.\n\u201cThey told us we were going to Greece,\u201d the crew member said. \u201cNot here. They lied to us.\u201d\nAll around the Ionian Spirit, the scenes of the evacuation were evident, as more than 650 young Ghanaian men slept on the decks of the vessels or slumped over the tables where tourists would ordinarily be enjoying their meals. Also on board were more than 100 Nigerians, 72 Libyans and smaller numbers of other nationalities.\nThey were an exhausted lot. Many had been sleeping in the open for weeks, and had waited, anxiety rising, for a berth on any of the few relief ships that have risked docking in Misurata.\n\n11 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nIsaac Owuso, 33, a construction laborer, offered a mixture of gratitude that he had at last left the city with his deep disappointment at his recent fate. He had traveled from Ghana to Libya, he said, to work on the Qaddafi government\u2019s construction projects and earn money for his wife and child.\nWhen the war erupted, he had managed to save $2,000 euros and 100 Libyan dinars, which he kept hidden in his clothes. He tried to flee Misurata overland, he said, but was robbed at a checkpoint. He said he did not know whether rebels or pro-Qaddafi gunmen manned the checkpoint. But he knew the result.\n\u201cLook at me,\u201d he said, pulling a lone dinar note from his pocket. \u201cThis is my life. See me? I have only this money and nothing more. How will I take care of my family?\u201d\nThe ship\u2019s cabins, meanwhile, held many wounded Libyans evacuated from the siege, including four recent amputees. Some were anti-Qaddafi fighters suffering grievous wounds.\n\u201cThank God for this ship,\u201d said Mustafa Youssif, whose leg was amputated on Sunday after he was hit by shrapnel while riding in a pickup truck near Tripoli Street, one of Misurata\u2019s fronts.\nIn other cabins were more victims: a 9-year-old boy struck in the teeth by shrapnel, and an anti-Qaddafi sniper shot through his mouth, a man peppered with shrapnel holes.\nOne deck also held several Filipino evacuees, including a group of teachers from Misurata University.\nThe teachers said they had come from the Philippines in December, and had not yet been paid their salary by the government when the war started. The university had closed, and since the bombardments of the city by the pro-Qaddafi forces, they had been surviving with help from Libyan neighbors.\n\u201cThey gave us food,\u201d said Zoe Contreras, 37, an English teacher. \u201cOur neighbors were giving us water. They sometimes were knocking on our door and then just giving us food.\u201d\nNot all of the foreign workers in Misurata had been so fortunate, they said. A group of evacuating nurses said more than a dozen of their friends and colleagues in Misurata had been missing since mid-March, when the pro-Qaddafi forces occupied the neighborhood near their apartment building.\nThe missing, they said, included five Filipino and four Bangladeshi nurses, as well as an Egyptian nurse and her husband and three children. The account underscored that the toll of the fighting in Misurata, which rebels say has killed more than 1,000 people, is far from tallied, and that there are potentially many classes of victims whose fates remain unknown.",

    "text": "Pakistan Is Also Erupting \u2014 Against the U.S.\n2011-03-31T12:18:14.000Z\nAs U.S. forces were firing hundreds of missiles to establish a Libyan no flight zone, Pakistani newspaper headlines were consumed by a different missile strike: \u201cPakistan furious as U.S. drone strike kills civilians,\u201d blared The Express Tribune; \u201c38 killed in drone strike on NWA tribal jirga,\u201d declared the Daily Times. \nThis week marks the second anniversary of the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cAf-Pak strategy\u201d to confront the \u201csecurity threats posed by extremists in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\u201d But while the United States scrambles to develop a response to protests in North Africa and the Middle East, its policy toward Pakistan is crumbling \u2014 with no clear fix in sight.\nLast December, the administration\u2019s \u201c2010 Afghanistan and Pakistan Annual Review\u201d reported positive developments throughout the region. According to the unclassified version, the U.S.-Pakistani \u201crenewed bilateral partnership is helping promote stability in Pakistan\u201d and defeat Islamic radicalism. But today, the facts are otherwise.\nPakistan is deeply divided and radicalism is spreading even among the nation\u2019s most privileged classes. After the governor of Punjab was murdered in January for supporting the repeal of Pakistan\u2019s blasphemy law, thousands took to the streets. But instead of protesting the murder, they marched in support of the law and the assassin. Pakistani lawyers \u2014 a group that was instrumental in toppling the Musharraf regime \u2014 threw rose petals at the accused killer and hailed him as a hero. \nA few weeks later, another opponent of the blasphemy law and Pakistan\u2019s only Christian cabinet member was gunned down. Although the culprits escaped, Rafi Usmani, the grand mufti of Pakistan, told the Associated Press, \u201cI am afraid that this could be an American conspiracy to defame the government of Pakistan, Muslims and Islam.\u201d\nFar from a U.S.-Pakistani \u201cpartnership,\u201d anti-Americanism is rampant. Last fall, 29.5 percent of students in postgraduate colleges and universities identified the United States as the greatest threat to Pakistan, according to a survey by the Pak Institute for Peace Studies. That number was more than twice as many as the next greatest threat, India, with whom Pakistan has fought four wars. Only 6.8 percent of Pakistan\u2019s young elites identified the Taliban as the greatest threat; 6.5 percent said it was Al Qaeda. In perhaps the most troubling response for America\u2019s strategic engagement, 68.3 percent thought Pakistan should not support the \u201cU.S.-led War on Terror,\u201d while only 21 percent thought it should.\nSince then, ongoing drone strikes, the killing of two alleged attackers by the C.I.A. contractor Raymond Davis, and the claims of his diplomatic immunity by the United States, have further inflamed public opinion. While payments to the dead men\u2019s families recently gained Davis\u2019s release, even moderate opposition politicians and journalists have criticized the settlement, even though the payment of \u201cblood money\u201d is sanctioned by Shariah law. \nAs for the United States promoting stability within Pakistan, the Obama administration\u2019s expanded use of drones appears to be having the opposite effect. As early as 2009, according to a leaked cable, a former U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Anne Patterson, warned that America\u2019s unilateral targeting of militants risks \u201cdestabilizing the Pakistani state, alienating both the civilian government and military leadership, and provoking a broader governance crisis in Pakistan without finally achieving the goal.\u201d\nOne of the authors of this article, Shamshek Asad, was raised in Pakistan. During a trip to Karachi a week ago, he experienced greater anti-Americanism than ever before at all levels of society. More than 60 years after independence and 40 years after the loss of Bangladesh, Pakistan remains extraordinarily leery of foreign influence. Coupled with a remarkable belief in foreign conspiracies and a decade of anti-U.S. propaganda by Islamists, this generates not only resentment, but near paranoia about U.S. intentions in Pakistan.\nOptimists argue that U.S.-Pakistani relations may have hit a rough patch, but they remain sound. Skeptics contend that the United States has failed to bolster President Asif Ali Zardari\u2019s government, despite billions of dollars in military and civilian aid, and that America\u2019s efforts have yielded more antipathy than gratitude. \nTwo years ago, the Af-Pak Strategy answered Pakistani criticism that America had historically abandoned both countries by committing \u201call elements of international power \u2014 diplomatic, informational, military and economic\u201d to the region. It is time to assess whether this ambitious strategy is working.\nThe Obama administration should conduct an independent review of U.S. policy toward Pakistan. The questions it should address include: Is the core goal of the United States \u2014 to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat Al Qaeda and its safe havens in Pakistan \u2014 distorting American policy toward Pakistan? Would a lower U.S. profile and more modest agenda be more effective and sustainable? Do the tactical benefits of drone strikes further long-term, strategic goals? And should the U.S. abandon the \u201cAf-Pak\u201d regional approach in favor of more tailored policies for each country? \nThere are no easy answers. But after two years of limited progress in an increasingly radicalized, nuclear Pakistan, tough questions are the least of our worries.\n  Peter Charles Choharis,  a visiting fellow at the American Security Project, practices international law in Washington.Shamshek Asad is an international energy consultant.

    "text": "Helping Immigrants Navigate Government\n2011-04-11T03:06:51.000Z\nAt a Haitian church in Canarsie, Brooklyn, officials from the mayor\u2019s office spent a recent Saturday morning discussing food stamps and discrimination in the workplace, their words translated into Creole for an audience of some 50 people. \nThe next night, another delegation spoke to a group of Bangladeshi immigrants in the Bronx about police precincts and community boards. In recent weeks, officials have held similar meetings with Albanians, Mexicans and West Africans. \nThe forums are part of a new program, run by the mayor\u2019s office, that is intended to improve the relationship between city government and immigrants who are often wary of local authorities or unaware of city services available to them. \nOne N.Y.C., One Nation, as the program is called, is in some ways an acknowledgment that despite Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s vocal support for the city\u2019s immigrants, too many of them remain cut off from the mainstream. The first forums have found many immigrants distrustful of the local police, unengaged with their elected officials and unable to find reliable legal help for their immigration problems. \n\u201cHow do we fundamentally engage our immigrant communities to help them understand that their voice matters?\u201d asked Fatima A. Shama, commissioner of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Immigrant Affairs, which is coordinating the program. \nThe initiative, which began in February, also represents a shift of emphasis for the Bloomberg administration, which has spent significant energy rallying mayors and business leaders to lobby for a broad overhaul of federal immigration policy \u2014 only to see its campaign stall in Congress. \nInstead of looking toward Washington, the new program focuses on government at its most humble: police precinct councils, community board meetings, zoning laws. While local officials and agencies directly affect immigrants\u2019 quality of life and sense of empowerment and security, Ms. Shama said immigrants rarely connect with them. \nAt the meeting with Haitian immigrants at Beracan Baptist Church on Flatlands Avenue, the program\u2019s director, Camelia Ghiuzeli Mitchell, asked whether anyone had ever heard of police precinct councils \u2014 neighborhood groups that meet with the local police to discuss safety issues. Not a hand went up.\n\u201cOur immigrant communities,\u201d Ms. Shama said, \u201cknow how to navigate a lot of the city that they participate in \u2014 they know how to put a parade together. But do they know what a community board is? Are they engaged with the park cleanup?\u201d\n\u201cThe success of the city will always be dependent on people being a part of their communities,\u201d she added. \u201cNow more than ever we have to make sure that immigrants trust us.\u201d\nThe program was created in part as a response to some of the inflammatory remarks in last summer\u2019s debate over a proposed Islamic center and mosque near ground zero, as well as several high-profile attacks against Muslims, gays and other minorities. \u201cWe had some intolerance happening in the city, which forces us to be smarter to ensure that our immigrant communities feel more comfortable,\u201d Ms. Shama said. \nOne Nation, a national foundation that promotes civic engagement with an emphasis on reaching Muslims, is financing the project with a two-year, $500,000 grant to be supplemented by at least $500,000 raised by the New York Community Trust.\nMs. Shama said the New York initiative, which seeks to engage myriad immigrant groups on a wide range of projects, is the first of its scale in the country.\nPosters and speakers will urge immigrants to become more involved with their children\u2019s schools, to participate in English study programs and to open bank accounts. College readiness seminars and financial literacy sessions will be offered.\nBut the program also seeks to identify a new wave of leaders in immigrant communities who have ideas for reshaping their neighborhoods to better suit the changing populations. The mayor\u2019s office is teaming up with the Coro New York Leadership Center to offer small grants to 20 immigrants, who will receive leadership training and help in creating community development projects. The hope is to cultivate a group of potential leaders to represent communities whose voices are seldom heard, Ms. Shama said. \nAdvocates for immigrants said they were pleased to see the city focusing on civic engagement, as long as the authorities continued offering basic services to the needy. \n\u201cIf you\u2019re shuttling your family to soup kitchens, it\u2019s hard to play a meaningful role on the community board,\u201d said Andrew Friedman, co-executive director of Make the Road NYC. \u201cBut there is a real desire in immigrant communities throughout the city to figure out how to engage.\u201d\nThe meeting with the Haitians showed both the project\u2019s potential and its challenges. The group sat patiently through more than an hour of presentations about city services and privacy policies, but at the end, few questions touched on any of the programs mentioned. Instead, nearly all asked about their immigration status, a matter largely beyond the program\u2019s purview. \nStill, many in the audience said the session proved valuable. \u201cAs an immigrant, we don\u2019t know our rights, how to get help, who to talk to,\u201d said Verlande Antoine, a Haitian nursing assistant who has lived in New York for nearly a decade. \u201cYou never know when you\u2019re going to need help.\u201d ",

    "text": "With Takeover Bids, \u2018No\u2019 Is Often the Most Profitable Reply\n2011-02-21T03:40:45.000Z\n\u00a0\nA company\u2019s independence may sometimes be worth more than shareholders realize. Wall Street wisdom suggests investors who turn away juicy takeover offers end up losing out. Yet some recently aborted deals haven\u2019t turned out so badly for shareholders of the targets. Take the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. The Canadian government in November blocked BHP Billiton\u2019s $39 billion bid for Potash, the fertilizer mining group. Ignoring the specious protectionist reasoning, Ottawa did Potash\u2019s shareholders a favor.\nTrue, they were never going to accept BHP\u2019s original $130 a share offer. Even before Canada struck down the deal, the stock traded closer to $150 and indications were that BHP was planning to raise its bid to about $155. That would probably have secured a deal given the influx of arbitrageurs to the shareholder roster.\nBut the stock has since rallied, topping $190 a share early last week. As it turns out, shareholders agreeing to a bid at $155 would have given up nearly 25 percent upside. That was the contention of Potash\u2019s management at the time, but it wasn\u2019t obvious. Since then, food and other commodities have heated up, raising the price of fertilizer. The salt potash now fetches nearly $370 a ton, up from around $340 in November, according to InfoMine.com. That partly explains the valuation increase.\nThere are other examples. CF Industries, which also makes agricultural fertilizers, is worth 50 percent more than rival Agrium wanted to pay for it a year ago. And Casey\u2019s General Stores is trading at more than the unsuccessful bid for it by Alimentation Couche-Tard, the Canadian convenience store chain. Owners of stock in Facebook, the social networking giant, might recall that Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, resisted approaches worth $1 billion or more, including from Yahoo, in 2006. The latest talk puts its worth at $50 billion.\nOf course, some deals come with premiums that shareholders would be crazy to turn down. Some come with a tempting mix of ready cash and a desirable acquirer\u2019s stock. And some spurned approaches, like Microsoft\u2019s rejected offer for Yahoo, turn out to cost investors dearly. Even so, as Potash shareholders can attest, it sometimes pays to say no.\nAdjustments to Microlending\nMuhammad Yunus received the Nobel Peace Prize for pioneering microcredit. Now, Bangladesh plans to oust him from Grameen Bank, which he created, as microfinance reels from the controversy last year in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.\nThe model of offering loans to village start-ups too small for conventional banks still works, but microlenders must go beyond credit and help the poor manage the wealth such loans create. Microlenders face two main accusations. One is that the $65 billion industry charges rates as usurious as the loan sharks it was supposed to supplant. Yet the usual 28 percent rate is no more than banks charge credit card customers for unsecured credit elsewhere. True, unscrupulous lenders add hidden charges. But even the poor know a bad deal when they see one. Here, consumer education and competition can only help.\nThe other allegation has more weight. Many poor borrowers are buried under too many loans. Critics blame overly aggressive marketing, but the real problem is one of identification. Recognizing customers indebted to multiple lenders will require credit bureaus \u2014 a tall order in nations like India where even birth certificates are scarce. Governments should expedite the process.\nMicrolenders have nothing to gain from borrowers defaulting. Mr. Yunus himself has suggested that microlenders be run as not-for-profit organizations, and their rates capped. That hardly offers a solution. Adding regulatory restrictions would make loans to the poor more expensive by increasing the cost of doing business. And making microlenders nonprofit would substitute charity for the commercial discipline that makes microfinance more effective than aid.\nMicrolenders should, however, take a leaf from Grameen\u2019s playbook. The bank is run on commercial principles, and offers customers both savings accounts and insurance. Grameen\u2019s customers own 90 percent of the company\u2019s stock. Many of its rivals bring global capital to the world\u2019s poorest areas and earn profits for the privileged. By servicing the other side of the poor\u2019s balance sheet, microlenders would get a better sense of the creditworthiness of their customers and make them partners in the enterprise.\nROB COX and WAYNE ARNOLD ",

    "text": "Jamaica Comes Alive With Airport Arrivals\n2011-12-30T02:02:24.000Z\nA steady stream of travelers dragging wheeled suitcases and speaking a Babel of tongues is helping revive downtown Jamaica, a vibrant hub of Queens that weathered several gloomy decades of decay and crime. \nThe wheelers are passengers from abroad heading to or getting off the sleek, driverless trains of Kennedy International Airport\u2019s AirTrain, whose ridership has tripled since it opened in 2003. Most travelers are not dawdling in Jamaica itself and are simply connecting to the E, J or Z subway lines or the Long Island Rail Road trains that can whisk them in 20 minutes to Manhattan. But enough linger for the night to encourage three developers in recent years to open budget hotels \u2014 a 64-room Ramada, a 72-room Quality Inn and a 66-room Sleep Inn. \n\u201cSeventy percent of my guests travel by AirTrain,\u201d explained Chandresh Patel, operator of the Ramada, where rooms go for $99 a night, less than two-thirds the price of a Midtown equivalent. \nAnd some of the hotel guests choose to cruise the area\u2019s increasingly inviting shopping corridor. Flying in from Bermuda, Dija Brown, 31, picked the Ramada so she could load up on clothes for her children, Papi, 12, and Angel, 7, at Shoppers World and V.I.M. nearby. The savings can more than offset the trip\u2019s expense. \n\u201cA pair of jeans is $50 to $80 in Bermuda,\u201d she said. \u201cHere I can walk over to Jamaica Avenue and get two for $20 at V.I.M.\u201d \nJamaica, a honeycomb of clamorous department stores, government offices and apartment houses until too many stores and residents departed for the suburbs, is undergoing something of a resurrection. It is a gradual and halting upswing, but an upswing nonetheless. \nA Home Depot has replaced the shell of the old Long Island Press, a newspaper that closed in 1977. Through New York City-sponsored initiatives, a striking building with 346 rental apartments behind the rescued brick facade of the former Queens Family Court opened last year, with silk-stocking amenities like a lobby dry cleaner and a gym. A new 400-seat theater in a restored landmark Dutch Reformed church hosts acts like Haitian dancers and African jazz singers. \nA retail district that lost Macy\u2019s and Gertz more than three decades ago is welcoming recent arrivals like Gap Generation and Zales that are joining slightly older settlers like Old Navy and Bally Total Fitness and stores that specialize in hip-hop fashion. (Jamaica was a cradle of hip-hop.) A strip of shops is being constructed opposite the AirTrain on one side of a railroad underpass that for years had been used for unloading railroad trash. \nA nightclub notorious for drugs and shootings has been alchemized into a stately children\u2019s science addition to the Queens Library. Though it still loses money, the 20-year-old Jamaica Market, an ethnic food court with two rows of stalls offering Cajun-style chicken, Caribbean goat curry and Chinese and Japanese dishes, is becoming a lively lunchtime magnet, in part thanks to the presence of new immigrants from the West Indies, South America and Bangladesh.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of changes; you see a lot more stores opening,\u201d said Justin Kilian, a bank manager eating at the market with two friends. \u201cThere\u2019s an Applebee\u2019s, a commercial restaurant. You never had that over here.\u201d \nThe transformation is a contrast to longtime erosion in downtown Jamaica, which at one time was the city\u2019s third-largest shopping district but suffered from the citywide middle-class exodus to the suburbs of the 1950s and 1960s aggravated by crack and crime epidemics. \nBut the AirTrain is among the factors causing a resurgence. The rail link, which for a $5 MetroCard fare ferries tourists in eight minutes from Kennedy\u2019s Terminal 1, recorded 3.9 million passengers using its Jamaica hub in the 12 months ending in September, a 6.8 percent increase from the year before. (There is also a terminal in Howard Beach.)\n\u201cIt may have been slower coming than they first thought, but some of that development that was hoped for with the AirTrain is now starting to appear,\u201d said Charles Brecher, a professor of public administration at New York University who studied the AirTrain. \nA big setback, however, was the bankruptcy in 2009 of Mary Immaculate Hospital, a 162-bed institution that the year before had more than 100,000 patient visits. Its three buildings along Rufus King Park were sold to a developer for a rock-bottom $7 million; their fate is unclear. The closing sucked 1,200 jobs out of the neighborhood. \nAnd the area immediately around the AirTrain \u2014 five blocks west of the shopping district\u2019s heart \u2014 is still forlorn, with cluttered groceries and at least one \u201cgentleman\u2019s club.\u201d A former meatpacking plant a few steps from the AirTrain was torn down, but the site\u2019s future is murky. \nSo, many travelers simply pass through the transit hub. \n\u201cIf they have to wait for the next train, they\u2019ll stop; if they have to catch a train, they don\u2019t stop,\u201d said Ali Ahmed, a clerk at the Long Island Deli Express. \nMuch of the energy for the new changes has been driven by projects started years ago by the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation. It had helped attract York College, which is part of the City University of New York; an 11-story office building of the federal Social Security Administration; and an extension of the subway along Archer Avenue. It runs the Jamaica Market and three garages and two parking lots with 1,900 spaces that make shopping easier. \nAlso crucial to Jamaica\u2019s resurgence, said F. Carlisle Towery, an urban planner who has been the corporation\u2019s president for almost four decades, was a 2007 rezoning from manufacturing to commercial and residential uses. \nJamaica has also been helped by the revitalization of York College, which has an enrollment of 7,400. Its effort to create a symbiosis with its neighbor, the federal Food and Drug Administration\u2019s regional headquarters, has produced 100 internships and a bachelor\u2019s degree in pharmaceutical sciences. \nStill, with the AirTrain, the downtown has a new mission \u2014 a pause that refreshes, to use an advertising slogan. In addition to the three new hotels, a fourth, a Comfort Inn, is under construction, a developer of two more (a 160-room Marriott Courtyard and a 160-room Fairfield Inn) is seeking financing and the development corporation has acquired sites for two others. \nRajendra Patel (no relation to Chandresh), who is building the Comfort Inn, with 72 rooms that he said would go for as little as $80 per night, said he liked downtown Jamaica because guests could entertain themselves at the 15-screen multiplex on Jamaica Avenue or catch the Mets at CitiField, a short subway ride away. \n\u201cIt is the location,\u201d he said.",

    "text": "Many Refugees From Libya Don\u2019t Want to Go Home\n2011-03-10T02:26:39.000Z\nCHOUCHA TRANSIT CAMP, Tunisia \u0097 Europe fears Abdou Dirisu Minimu Aliu.\nA towering, square-jawed Nigerian, his forearms swollen from years of building furniture in Libya, Mr. Aliu, 26, arrived at this sprawling camp on the Tunisian border after fleeing the violence in Tripoli. Destitute, his $2,600 in savings stolen by Libyan fighters, he now hopes desperately to reach a stable, prosperous country. Europe beckons.\nThere are thousands like him here, on the northern coast of Africa, and almost certainly tens of thousands more trapped in Libya. They had left their home countries for an oil-wealthy nation offering abundant employment and higher wages. They shrink from the prospect of returning penniless to the corrupt governments and stagnant economies they first fled.\n\u201cThere is something I want you to know,\u201d Mr. Aliu told a United Nations aid worker. \u201cI\u2019d have preferred to die in the war zone in Libya than to go back to Nigeria.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know what it\u2019s like to be a man who has lost everything?\u201d he asked, plaintive, staring blankly at the ground. The aid worker, David Welin, moved close to Mr. Aliu. \n\u201cI\u2019m sure that what you lived in Libya, what\u2019s awaiting you in Nigeria, is not good,\u201d he replied. But the United Nations would probably not be able to help, Mr. Welin said. For the time being, Mr. Aliu and thousands like him, principally from sub-Saharan Africa, are left to contemplate the 70 miles of sea that separate Tunisia from the Italian island of Lampedusa, and the European continent beyond. Some have begun to make arrangements with Tunisian traffickers for an illegal crossing.\n\u201cSo many Nigerians are wanting to go over,\u201d said Stanley Tawaris, 42, a slender Nigerian welder who lived for a decade in a two-room cinder-block lean-to in Zawiyah, west of Tripoli. \u201cWe struggled in Libya and acquired nothing. The best thing for us is to go forward, and not to go back to our country.\u201d\nHis three children live in Nigeria; he sent $200 or $300 most months, he said, and worries he would never be able to provide so much if he returned to Nigeria. He hopes to join relatives in Germany, France or the Netherlands, Mr. Tawaris said, and find work.\n\u201cAnything,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it is labor work, I don\u2019t care.\u201d\nHe hopes the winds that have whipped through this dusty camp will soon ease, and leave the Mediterranean calm; a friend has been arranging for a boat.\nThere are currently 15,000 migrants here, but there are provisions to accommodate as many as 30,000, organizers say. Bulldozers are clearing ground for an additional two camps nearby, and humanitarian groups continue to stockpile food and supplies in anticipation of thousands upon thousands more fleeing migrants, as Libya descends further into civil conflict.\nAbout 1.5 million foreign laborers were thought to reside in Libya before the outbreak of violence last month; about 200,000 have since fled the country.\nWhat little they had to lose was often lost in their flight out of Libya. \nIt is perhaps a measure of their desperation that they had chosen to stay in Libya at all. Workers here offer accounts of harassment and violence directed against the foreign laborers who worked on Libyan oil platforms, kneaded Libyan bread and built Libyan houses.\nIn Libya, \u201cdogs are treated better than black Africans,\u201d said Jean-Philippe Chauzy, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration. Because many of them enter the country illegally, he said, they \u201chave no official status, no visibility.\u201d They have come to constitute a sort of abusable underclass.\n\u201cThis country is racist, there\u2019s no other word for it,\u201d said Mansouria Mokhefi, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the Paris-based French Institute of International Relations. \u201cThere is a hierarchy of races.\u201d\n Blacks are widely referred to as \u201cAbd,\u201d or slaves. Bangladeshis are viewed as little better, and even Arab Egyptians and Tunisians are considered to have limited rights.\nMigrant workers tell of the \u201cgangsters\u201d who hold foreigners at knifepoint in the Libyan streets, stealing their money and telephones with impunity. \nAt night, said Francis Appiah, 35, a Ghanaian mason who fled the western Libyan city of Zuwarah, \u201cyou weren\u2019t able to go out to buy anything,\u201d for fear of attacks. He added that thieves had once stolen a DVD player, a television and speakers from his home.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go to the police, because sometimes they arrest black people for no reason,\u201d he said. His landlord once had Mr. Appiah arrested, he said, because he had requested payment for plastering the interior of the man\u2019s house.\nA small, broad-smiling man with angular cheeks and no front teeth, wearing a faded Levi\u2019s denim jacket, Mr. Appiah said he had come to Libya two years ago hoping to move on to Europe. Now, he said, perhaps he will. \u201cI\u2019m here with nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere there is money, where there is work, I will go.\u201d\n\u201cIf Africans were not poor, they would not be in Libya,\u201d said Mr. Tawaris, the Nigerian, who was once stabbed repeatedly in the thigh by a thief who attacked him in the street. Though he found a Libyan doctor willing to stitch up a black man\u2019s wound, he could not find a doctor willing to remove the sutures; he removed them himself. \u201cIf you are not strong, you cannot live there,\u201d he said.\nHe has been languishing in his tent here, drawing slowly on cigarettes sold at the edge of the camp by local Tunisians, hoping for a boat.\n\u201cIf our country was a very nice place to be,\u201d said Mr. Tawaris, his face stern, \u201cwe would not have gone to a place like Libya.\u201d",

    "text": "Robert Whitaker, the Beatles\u2019 Photographer, Dies at 71\n2011-10-02T00:03:44.000Z\nRobert Whitaker photographed the Beatles, Eric Clapton and Mick Jagger, and wars from Vietnam to the Middle East. He aimed his camera up Salvador Dali\u2019s nostrils in search of a surrealist effect. His pictures were displayed at Britain\u2019s National Portrait Gallery.\nBut his most talked-about work was one that most people never got to see when it was released: a photograph of the Beatles on an album cover that was quickly pulled from public view. Known in Beatles lore as the \u201cbutcher cover,\u201d it showed the Beatles, wearing white butchers\u2019 coats, festooned with chunks of raw meat and dismembered dolls. John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr are smiling; Paul McCartney\u2019s mouth is agape.\nThe album, \u201cYesterday and Today,\u201d went on sale in selected stores a few days before it was to be officially released by Capitol Records, on June 15, 1966. But the day before the planned release, Capitol recalled the record in the face of distributors\u2019 protests that the cover was in bad taste.\nDefinite numbers are hard to come by, but hundreds of thousands of copies seem to have been recalled. Some 25,000 may have been sold. The cover photo was replaced by another by Mr. Whitaker, the group\u2019s official photographer, showing the Beatles clustered around an upright opened steamer trunk.\nMr. Whitaker, who died on Sept. 20 at 71, had said that the idea for the photograph was entirely his, though he was never consistent in explaining it. Sometimes he said he was not sure why he had posed the Beatles that way; other times he said the butcher theme was meant to suggest that the Beatles, so worshipped by their fans, were real flesh-and-blood people. On another occasion he said the image was to be one of three that would tell a story.\nThe album itself was a compilation, offering songs, like \u201cYesterday,\u201d from previous albums and others, like \u201cI\u2019m Only Sleeping\u201d and \u201cAnd Your Bird Can Sing,\u201d from the coming British release of the album \u201cRevolver.\u201d\u00a0(American versions of\u00a0\u201cYesterday\u201d and \"Revolver\" featured different songs.) It was the only Beatles record to lose money for Capitol. Still, it rose to No. 1 on the music charts by July 30 and stayed there for five weeks. But for many Beatles\u2019 fans, the hodgepodge nature of the album made the cover the most compelling thing.\nThe album came at a pivotal point in the Beatles\u2019 career, however, midway between their first No. 1 record and their breakup. Many saw the cover picture as a reflection of a new attitude and image: more willing to expand artistically and court controversy, no longer the floppy-haired Fab Four. A few months earlier there was an outcry over John Lennon\u2019s remark that the Beatles were more popular than Jesus, and two months later the band played its last scheduled concert.\nReports in the British press, quoting Dave Brolan, a friend and photo-archivist, said Mr. Whitaker died of cancer in West Sussex, England.\nIn addition to photographing events like the Beatles\u2019 1965 Shea Stadium concert, Mr. Whitaker captured them in private moments. One was of John Lennon with a dandelion covering an eye. Mr. Whitaker\u2019s pictures were used in \u201cRevolver\u2019s\u201d cover design. He also photographed Gerry and the Pacemakers and other stars handled by the Beatles\u2019 manager, Brian Epstein.\nMr. Whitaker photographed much of the London scene of the 1960s and early \u201970s, including Carnaby Street fashions. He made pictures of Mick Jagger as a movie actor, and helped create the cover of Cream\u2019s \u201cDisraeli Gears,\u201d the group\u2019s breakthrough album in the United States in 1967. He also contributed to early editions of the countercultural magazine \u201cOz,\u201d including a collage depicting a woman on a toilet flying over the Houses of Parliament.\nMr. Whitaker turned to war photography in the 1970s, covering conflicts in Cambodia, Vietnam, Bangladesh and the Middle East. He was wounded by a grenade in Vietnam. He gave up professional photography after his wife, Sue, was nearly killed in Syria by a rocket in 1972. She, a daughter and two sons survive him.\nRobert Whitaker was born on Nov. 13, 1939, in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, England. At 16, he cut up a book about Dali to make collages, which he then sent to the artist. Three decades later, he met with Dali to try \u201cto get inside his head,\u201d as he put it, by aiming his camera into his ears, mouth and nose. (In 2007, he published the pictures in a book, \u201cIn the Company of Dali.\u201d)\nIn 1961, Mr. Whitaker moved to Australia, where he owned a studio and shot fashion photos for the Australian edition of Vogue. When the Beatles toured Australia in 1964, he accompanied a journalist friend to interview Mr. Epstein. Deciding Mr. Epstein resembled a Roman emperor, Mr. Whitaker composed a regal photograph of him. Mr. Epstein liked it and introduced him to the Beatles, who soon made him their official photographer.\nAfter giving up photography, Mr. Whitaker and his wife bought a farm in England, growing crops and raising cattle. He stored his photographs in a chicken shed. After he was injured in a car accident in 1987, he began cataloging the pictures and ultimately published them in books and showed them at exhibitions, including one at the National Portrait Gallery in London.\nPristine, unopened copies of the original Beatles \u201cbutcher\u201d album, originally priced at $2.99, have sold for more than $20,000. Mr. Whitaker said he never owned one.",

    "text": "250 Migrants Missing After Boat Sinks Off Italy\n2011-04-06T13:10:53.000Z\nROME \u2014 More than 250 people, including women and children, were missing on Wednesday after their boat capsized off the coast of the Italian island of Lampedusa in the worst shipwreck since thousands of migrants began traveling to Italy because of the unrest in North Africa.\nThe vessel, which capsized in the predawn dark, had been carrying mostly sub-Saharan Africans, including at least one pregnant woman. The capsized vessel was among the first to try to reach Lampedusa from Libya since fighting began in Libya in February. About 22,000 migrants have arrived on the island since January, most of them from Tunisia.\nThe shipwreck is an alarming sign of the challenges facing Italy as it contends with a wave of migrants leaving North Africa. Aid officials on Wednesday called for a swifter response in boat rescues and better coordination among Mediterranean countries in distinguishing between \u201ceconomic immigrants\u201d seeking work in Europe and refugees seeking asylum. \nAfter interviewing survivors on Lampedusa, Italian officials and the International Organization for Migration estimated that more than 250 people were missing. \nBy Wednesday afternoon, an Italian patrol boat and a fishing boat had rescued 50 people and had taken them to Lampedusa, but coast guard officials feared that many more were still at sea, and rough weather was hampering rescue efforts. \n\u201cWe are still looking for at the least 150 people in the sea, but we fear there could be even more than that,\u201d said Cmdr. Valerio Alessandro, a spokesman for the Italian port authorities. He later revised that number to 250, and he said about 20 bodies had been seen in the water.\nAccording to the International Organization for Migration, the boat left Libya carrying migrants and asylum seekers from Somalia, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Ivory Coast, Chad and Sudan. The organization said that an estimated 40 women and 5 children had been on board, and that only 2 women had been rescued so far. \nEarly Wednesday morning, an Italian Coast Guard patrol boat reached the stricken vessel after those aboard, using a satellite phone, had sought help from the Maltese maritime authorities, Commander Alessandro said.\nJust as the coast guard boat reached the vessel, which was taking on water, its engine stalled. Strong waves and panicking passengers caused the vessel to rock, people began falling overboard and it capsized. \nItalian Coast Guard officials were using aircraft and boats to search for possible survivors, with help from the financial police, Commander Alessandro said.\nLying in a clinic in Lampedusa, Peter Hougot, 29, from Cameroon, recounted the crossing from Libya. \u201cMy 24-year-old girlfriend died, and I lost her and my friend who was traveling with us,\u201d Mr. Hougot said. \nHe said he had been working as a house painter in Libya for the past two years and had paid $400 to a middleman to cross the Mediterranean to Italy. \nHe said that he had refused to join a militia fighting for Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and that in response he was told \u201cto go out to go to Italy.\u201d \nIn a television interview, one survivor said he had paid a Somali group for passage to Italy from Libya. \n\u201cThe survivors are all in a state of shock,\u201d said Simona Moscarelli, an official for the International Organization for Migration who was acting as an interpreter for the rescued migrants and the police in Lampedusa on Wednesday.\n\u201cOne man told me he had lost his 1-year-old son. One of the two surviving women told me how she had lost her husband,\u201d Ms. Moscarelli added in a statement. \nThe boat capsized about 39 miles from Lampedusa, which since January has attracted thousands of migrants and refugees fleeing unrest in North Africa. Some of the migrants from the boat said in Italian television interviews that they had come from the western port city of Zuwarah, near the Tunisian border.\nLast week, Lampedusa was on the brink of collapse, running low on food and water, with thousands of migrants sleeping in the open air. In response, Italy transferred many of them to makeshift tent camps on the Italian mainland, from which a number of them easily escaped and tried to make their way to other parts of Italy and Europe to seek work. \nThe spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Italy, Laura Boldrini, said the shipwreck underscored the need for better coordination in identifying the migrants arriving in Italy from North Africa. \nSo far, most have been Tunisians seeking work, Ms. Boldrini said, but in recent days more boats have been coming from Libya and could contain refugees. \u201cAt the moment, this has been very limited, but we have to be ready for the possibility they will come,\u201d she said. \nOn Tuesday, the Italian interior minister, Roberto Maroni, signed an agreement with the Tunisian government to try to block the flow of migrants from that country. The Tunisian authorities will accept the repatriation of new arrivals, and Italy will provide Tunisia with boats and off-road vehicles to put into effect the border controls that have almost ceased since Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali was ousted from the Tunisian presidency in a popular revolt in January.\nItaly said it would also grant some Tunisian arrivals six-month temporary residence permits. \nCritics have objected that the agreement does not set any dates or provide practical details on how the repatriation would take place. In a statement on Wednesday on the Italian Interior Ministry\u2019s Web site, Mr. Maroni expressed satisfaction with the renewed cooperation between Italy and Tunisia, but he also said the agreement \u201cwill now have to be implemented.\u201d",

    "text": "Biogas Offers Poor Countries a Cleaner, Safer Fuel\n2011-10-25T17:36:40.000Z\nNEPALGANJ, NEPAL \u2014 Here\u2019s an unlikely starting point for clean energy: No toilets, and plenty of dung.\nIn developing countries where domestic animals are ubiquitous and sewage systems rare, biogas technology \u2014 in this case methane derived from feces \u2014 can provide both valuable fuel and improved sanitation. \nUnlike directly burning animal dung, the methane is clean-burning and odorless. And the technology has benign byproducts: reductions in deforestation and disease.\nDalla, a village of a hundred or so mud-walled, thatch-roof huts, clusters along a narrow dirt road a few kilometers from the forests of the Bardiya National Park in southwest Nepal. Buffaloes and cows lounge under thatch lean-tos to escape the hot sun. But unlike typical villages, Dalla\u2019s approximately 550 residents use biogas for cooking in place of wood.\nBiogas can also work in urban areas and with human waste. A few hours from Mumbai, a sprawling public toilet complex serving visitors to the temple of the Indian guru Sai Baba generates enough biogas to provide back-up power for the temple complex, which occupies almost a hectare, or two acres.\nThere are clear environmental benefits to using biogas, for both forest conservation and combating climate change. An average home biogas system can reduce firewood use by about 4.5 tons each year, which translates into 4 tons of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the World Wildlife Fund.\nJeet Bhadur Tharu, a 53-year-old farmer in Dalla, says almost all of his family\u2019s cooking fuel comes from methane piped into the kitchen from an air-tight pit of dung and excrement dug beneath his backyard.\nIn the hut that is his kitchen, Mr. Tharu turns a valve on a narrow pipe and lights a burner on the floor; a strong blue flame instantly appears.\nBefore using biogas, Mr. Tharu\u2019s family of five needed five to seven kilograms, or 11 to 15 pounds, of wood each day for cooking. The time-consuming task of gathering wood fell to his wife and daughters who cook in the small, unventilated kitchen. More than 1.5 million people worldwide die each year from diseases like lung cancer and childhood pneumonia caused by indoor air pollution from unventilated cooking fires, according to the World Health Organization.\nMr. Tharu\u2019s wife and daughters \u201ccouldn\u2019t always get dry wood,\u201d he said: \u201cIt was very smoky, hard for women. Hard for eyes, and coughing. A lot of laundry to wash because clothes got very dirty. Now it\u2019s better.\u201d \nThere is no stigma attached to using biogas derived from the toilet and his buffaloes and cows for cooking, Mr. Tharu added.\nIn the Terai, Nepal\u2019s thickly forested south, 61 percent of the people rely on wood for cooking, as fuel like liquid petroleum gas is too expensive for them, according to the World Wildlife Fund. Meanwhile there are 4.5 million cattle in the Terai that produce tons of dung each year. Most rural areas lack sewage systems.\nGiven this equation, it is not surprising that the government of Nepal, through its Alternative Energy Promotion Center, has helped build 200,000 biogas systems across the country and has set itself an ambitious target to eventually reach two million. The World Wildlife Fund supported the construction of 7,500 of the existing biogas systems in Nepal, including the ones in Dalla village.\nThe technology for a home biogas plant is simple and low-tech. Dig a pit ranging in size from 4 to 10 cubic meters, or 140 to 350 cubic feet (the average size is 6 cubic meters), line it with concrete and fit it with an air-tight concrete cover. Place animal dung and water into a round, concrete mixing bowl. A metal crank blends the concoction and pushes it into a pipe that feeds into the underground pit. Nearby, build a simple latrine made of concrete and bricks; gravity and water push human excrement into the same pit threough a pipe. \nDeprived of oxygen, the waste mix decomposes, giving off methane, which flows under its own pressure into a narrow PVC pipe leading into the kitchen.\nAnother byproduct of this anaerobic process is pathogen-free manure, which flows out of the pit when it fills up, and can be used by farmers as fertilizer.\nUgan Manandhar, program manager with the World Wildlife Fund in Nepal, says biogas systems require little maintenance and are safer than combustible tanks of liquid petroleum gas. Villagers are taught to use only dung and water in their biogas plants \u2014 no chemicals or plastic should go into the pit. They are given a basic training to fix faulty pipes, though Mr. Tharu says there have been no problems with his biogas system since its installation two years ago.\nStill, biogas systems are expensive for \u201cmiddle poor\u201d people like Mr. Tharu. It costs about $550 to build a home biogas system, including quality-control audits and a toilet. Most of that expense is paid by a combination of government subsidies and financing programs for villagers.\nFor now, biogas systems do not work in the colder conditions of Nepal\u2019s Himalayan ranges, since the bacteria involved need warmth to thrive and multiply. Mr. Manandhar of the World Wildlife Fund says research is being done on insulation for biogas plants that could function at higher altitudes.\nOn the other hand, biogas plants can work well in urban areas, where their waste treatment role makes them doubly useful. Since 1970, Sulabh International, a nongovernmental organization based in Delhi, has helped build more than a million affordable latrines, which work without running water. Barely a third of India\u2019s 1.2 billion people have access to hygienic latrines, and hundreds of millions have no choice but to relieve themselves in the open, which easily leads to the spread of disease.\nAcross India, Sulabh has built 200 biogas plants attached to toilets that are approved by the Indian government\u2019s Ministry of Non-conventional Energy Sources. Some are powered by large public toilet facilities used by thousands of people each day. The biggest is in Shirdi, about four hours\u2019 drive from Mumbai, which serves up to 7,000 people a day. The city is home to a temple devoted to the guru Sai Baba that attracts up to 100,000 visitors a day. With funds from a trust established by Sai Baba, who died in April of this year, Sulabh built what it describes as an \u201caesthetically exquisite and visually appealing, colorful toilet-cum-bath complex,\u201d with 120 toilets and 108 \u201cbathing cubicles.\u201d Biogas from human waste runs lights at the complex during power failures.\nBindeshwar Pathak, founder of Sulabh, argues that biogas technology is inherently safe, and so far there have been no accidents from leaks at Sulabh\u2019s biogas plants, he says. The organization has also helped build sanitary facilities in a dozen African countries including South Africa and Ethiopia, as well as in Laos, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.\nIn Kabul, where the city\u2019s infrastructure is in shambles, five Sulabh community sanitary complexes with biogas plants, financed by the Indian government, were formally opened in 2007 in the presence of Mr. Pathak, the mayor of Kabul, the Indian ambassador to Afghanistan and other dignitaries.\nThe underground pits remain warm enough even during Kabul\u2019s cold winters for bacterial decomposition to continue, and the design has attracted interest from U.S. Army engineers, who are considering building 40 similar complexes elsewhere in Afghanistan, according to Mr. Pathak. \n\u201cBiogas technology from human waste has multiple benefits: sanitation, bioenergy and manure,\u201d Sulabh emphasizes. And in Afghanistan, the unlikely benefits of dung could include an unconventional aid to diplomacy, too.",

    "text": "For Pepsi, a Business Decision With Social Benefit\n2011-02-21T20:51:33.000Z\nSAN GABRIEL, Mexico \u0097 In the past, farmers would make the dangerous trek north from this tiny town hidden in the rugged folds of the Jalisco mountain range to the United States, hoping to earn enough money doing odd jobs to cover debts incurred while cultivating the small plots of land that have been in their families for generations.\nBut more recently, many have managed to avoid the trips, staying home as the result of a new venture with PepsiCo, which buys their crops. \n \u201cSome of us used to go north to work to make money to pay off debts, but no longer,\u201d said Mart\u00edn Ramos Torres, a farmer, adding that at least two members of the cooperative he leads had been caught by United States border patrol agents and deported. \u201cIn just three years, everything has changed.\u201d\n Mr. Ramos and some 300 small farmers here no longer sell their corn to middlemen but directly to PepsiCo, which guarantees the price it will pay for their crops upfront. The deal enables the small farmers to secure credit to buy seeds and fertilizers, crop insurance and equipment.\n \u201cBefore, I had to sell my cow to buy what I needed,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Guzm\u00e1n Santana, another farmer selling to Pepsi. \u201cNow I keep the cow and my family has milk while I grow my crop.\u201d\nPepsiCo\u2019s work with the corn farmers reflects a relatively new approach by corporations trying to maintain a business edge while helping out small communities and farmers. Begun as a pilot project by the foundation affiliated with the company\u2019s Sabritas snack foods division, it is expanding to about 850 farmers to develop a local source of sunflower oil, which the company needs to improve the nutritional quality of its products.\nThe corn project saved PepsiCo transportation costs because the farms were close to two of its factories, and the use of local farms assured it access to types of corn best suited to its products and processes. \u201cThat gives us great leverage because corn prices don\u2019t fluctuate so much, but transportation costs do,\u201d said Pedro Padierna, president of PepsiCo\u2019s operations in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.\nThe social benefits of the corn program are obvious in higher incomes that have improved nutritional and educational standards among the participating farmers, not to mention its impact on illegal immigration and possibly even the reduction of marijuana production.\nThe sunflower farmers are expected to see similar benefits \u0097 but PepsiCo insists those benefits are ancillary to the business rationale for the program. \nA growing number of major companies have adopted similar business tacks aimed at profitability that also prove to be economically and socially beneficial for needy people. One of the earliest examples was Danone\u2019s development of a vitamin-enhanced yogurt product that sells for 11 cents in Bangladesh. The product is profit-neutral, but has given the company valuable insights into the 2.5 billion potential consumers who live on less than $2.50 a day.\n \u201cThese are markets,\u201d Harry Verhaar, head of strategic sustainability initiatives at Philips Electronics, said of countries with sizable populations of impoverished consumers. \nPhilips has begun selling low-cost, solar-powered lighting products in Africa to people who lack access to the electrical grid. \u201cWe are developing products to address them that are economically good for us as a company and also good for ecology and good for consumers,\u201d Mr. Verhaar said.\nThe products reduce the use of kerosene, the fuel of choice among the world\u2019s poorest consumers. Because they light homes that previously went dark at sundown, they may enable a child to study longer or a community to enjoy an evening soccer game.\nAnd they have spawned business. \u201cA guy will set up a small shop with a large solar panel on the roof or behind and charge a small fee for recharging the solar light,\u201d Mr. Verhaar said.\n\u201cWe are seeing an increased focus by companies looking to see how they can use their core capabilities for public good rather than simply writing a big check,\u201d said Gaurav Gupta, regional director for Asia at Dalberg Global Development Advisors, a consulting firm focused on international development. \u201cThey\u2019re starting to realize that the marginal cost of doing a little extra good produces such a great impact \u0097 and not only in terms of good will, but also because it\u2019s good for business.\u201d\nMr. Gupta stressed that what was emerging was not \u201ccorporate social responsibility,\u201d a loosely defined concept typically driven by corporate marketing departments, which he said was \u201clargely nonsense.\u201d\n\u201cThis is about a company\u2019s core activity, which is something it is constantly thinking about and working to improve,\u201d he said. \u201cIts impact on business can be defined and measured.\u201d\nDerek Yach, the former World Health Organization official who is now PepsiCo\u2019s senior vice president for global health and agriculture policy, said firmly: \u201cThis is a business. All the good things we want to do have to be financed out of the profits of the company, so why not do them while we are doing our business?\u201d Mr. Padierna described the program in the state of Jalisco as Act II of a three-act play, which started when the company needed a way to mitigate its impact on the potato market. Through a guaranteed purchase system similar to the one it uses with the small farmers, PepsiCo enticed big agribusinesses to invest in the development of potato varieties better suited to Mexico\u2019s tropical climate and also mitigated its impact on potato prices, which swung wildly because its demand was so large.\nToday, the company is the largest buyer of potatoes produced in Mexico, accounting for some 22 percent of total potato purchases there.\nWorking with small farmers was a bigger challenge. Mr. Guzm\u00e1n and Mr. Ramos, for instance, had little experience with pesticides, having previously relied on the local priest to bless away worms.\n Nor did they maintain bank accounts, a hurdle to payment by wire transfer. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have money to put in the bank,\u201d said Bonifacio Villalvazo, who together with Mr. Guzm\u00e1n and Mr. Ramos is a member of one of the cooperatives created by the program.\n The company teamed up with a Mexican nonprofit group, Fundaci\u00f3n Sembrando Trabajo, which extended to farmers in Jalisco a program it had begun in Chiapas. \u201cThe levers we use in this program are tiny, but they have tremendous impact,\u201d said Alberto Castelazo, chairman of Sembrando Trabajo. \nA team of engineers from the nonprofit did soil and other tests to determine what seeds and fertilizers would work best. The engineers live nearby and so are frequently on hand to offer farmers advice and services, like delivering the seeds, instructing farmers on how to plant them and counseling on the safe disposal of pesticide containers, which in the past had been re-used to store water and other things.\n\u201cThey taught us to first triple-wash them and then to poke holes in the bottom so they can\u2019t be reused,\u201d Mr. Guzm\u00e1n said. \u201cNow we use them to make fences\u201d \u0097 which in turn reduces the need to cut down trees, thereby reducing soil erosion.\n Other members of the group repeatedly stressed how helpful it was to know they would receive their seeds and supplies on time. In the past, they worked through intermediaries who would sell them what they needed to plant their crops, financing some or all of their purchases.\nThe intermediaries decided when to deliver seeds and fertilizer and when the farmers would harvest. And almost invariably, the price an intermediary would pay for that crop was less than the amount a farmer owed him \u0097 assuming he even agreed to take the crop. \u201cI planted a lot less because I didn\u2019t know if I could sell it and I didn\u2019t want to end up with a big debt,\u201d said Germ\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez Estrada, the youngest member of the cooperative. \u201cNow that I have a secure buyer, I plant twice as much.\u201d\nIndeed, the farmers said Pepsi\u2019s purchase guarantee was the most valuable aspect of the program, benefiting even farmers who did not participate. \u201cMy neighbors come to me and ask what Sabritas is going to pay me for my crop,\u201d Mr. Ramos said. \u201cNow everyone is getting that price.\u201d\nThe farmers said the price was higher than they ever got from any intermediary, which means they end up with money in the bank after a crop is harvested. Sembrando Trabajo estimates that while their output has increased by about 160 percent, their incomes have tripled over the three years the program has been in place.\n\u201cWell, it depends on the year and the crop, but, yes, we all have higher incomes in general,\u201d said Mat\u00edas Estrada Figueroa, the treasurer of the cooperative.\nThey now maintain bank accounts, which Ellis J. Juan, representative of the Inter-American Development Bank in Mexico, considers one of the primary \u201cmacro\u201d benefits of the program. \u201cThe minute one of these farmers gains access to the financial system, he in a sense has to become legal,\u201d Mr. Juan said. \u201cHe may have to pay taxes, which is good for Mexico, but he also develops a credit history that might later give him access to a loan he could use to send his child to college.\u201d\nOther broad benefits Mr. Juan cited were the program\u2019s potential to reduce illegal immigration to the United States and the cultivation of marijuana. \u201cThe minute you can have a crop that provides higher profits, that becomes a possibility, though of course it\u2019s hard to measure,\u201d he said.\nThe bank has struck an agreement with PepsiCo to provide up to $5 million in credit guarantees to support a program similar to the corn project. The new project has enlisted farmers in the states of Jalisco and Durango grow sunflowers, the first time since 1970s that the crop has been grown for anything other than floral arrangements and bird seed, according to PepsiCo. \nThe company will spend roughly $52 million over the next seven years to buy crops that may eventually produce 40,000 tons of sunflower oil. That oil will begin replacing the 80,000 tons of palm oil it needs each year for products made in Mexico. The new oil will improve the nutritional quality of the foods it makes and will lower transportation costs, since palm oil must be imported from Asia and Africa. That, in turn, will have environmental benefits.\nAs for the San Gabriel cooperative, its members are applying for a government grant to buy a tractor, which they say will increase productivity and yields. \u201cYes, a tractor or some other machinery, maybe a cooperative where we could sell seeds and fertilizers to other farmers,\u201d Mr. Ramos said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the beginning of what we might do.\u201d",

    "text": "Pakistan\u2019s Chief of Army Fights to Keep His Job\n2011-06-16T02:13:55.000Z\nISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 Pakistan\u2019s army chief, the most powerful man in the country, is fighting to save his position in the face of seething anger from top generals and junior officers since the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden, according to Pakistani officials and people who have met the chief in recent weeks. \nGen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, who has led the army since 2007, faces such intense discontent over what is seen as his cozy relationship with the United States that a colonels\u2019 coup, while unlikely, was not out of the question, said a well-informed Pakistani who has seen the general in recent weeks, as well as an American military official involved with Pakistan for many years. \nThe Pakistani Army is essentially run by consensus among 11 top commanders, known as the Corps Commanders, and almost all of them, if not all, were demanding that General Kayani get much tougher with the Americans, even edging toward a break, Pakistanis who follow the army closely said. \nWashington, with its own hard line against Pakistan, had pushed General Kayani into a defensive crouch, along with his troops, and if the general was pushed out, the United States would face a more uncompromising anti-American army chief, the Pakistani said. \nTo repair the reputation of the army, and to ensure his own survival, General Kayani made an extraordinary tour of more than a dozen garrisons, mess halls and other institutions in the six weeks since the May 2 raid that killed Bin Laden. His goal was to rally support among his rank-and-file troops, who are almost uniformly anti-American, according to participants and people briefed on the sessions. \nDuring a long session in late May at the National Defense University, the premier academy in Islamabad, the capital, one officer got up after General Kayani\u2019s address and challenged his policy of cooperation with the United States. The officer asked, \u201cIf they don\u2019t trust us, how can we trust them?\u201d according to Shaukaut Qadri, a retired army brigadier who was briefed on the session. General Kayani essentially responded, \u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Qadri said. \nIn response to pressure from his troops, Pakistani and American officials said, General Kayani had already become a more obstinate partner, standing ever more firm with each high-level American delegation that has visited since the raid to try and rescue the shattered American-Pakistani relationship.\nIn a prominent example of the new Pakistani intransigence, The New York Times reported Tuesday that, according to American officials, Pakistan\u2019s spy agency had arrested five Pakistani informants who helped the Central Intelligence Agency before the Bin Laden raid. The officials said one of them is a doctor who has served as a major in the Pakistani Army. In a statement on Wednesday, a Pakistani military spokesman called the story \u201cfalse\u201d and said no army officer had been detained. Over all, Pakistani and American officials said, the relationship was now more competitive and combative than cooperative. \nGeneral Kayani told the director of the C.I.A., Leon E. Panetta, during a visit here last weekend that Pakistan would not accede to his request for independent operations by the agency, Pakistani and American officials said. \nA long statement after the regular monthly meeting of the 11 corps commanders last week illuminated the mounting hostility toward the United States, even as it remains the army\u2019s biggest patron, supplying at least $2 billion a year in aid. \nThe statement, aimed at rebuilding support within the army and among the public, said that American training in Pakistan had only ever been minimal, and had now ended. \u201cIt needs to be clarified that the army had never accepted any training assistance from the United States except for training on the newly inducted weapons and some training assistance for the Frontier Corps only,\u201d a reference to paramilitary troops in the northwest tribal areas, the statement said. \nThe statement said that the C.I.A.-run drone attacks against militants in the tribal areas \u201cwere not acceptable under any circumstances.\u201d \nAllowing the drones to continue to operate from Pakistan was \u201cpolitically unsustainable,\u201d said the well-informed Pakistani who met with General Kayani recently. As part of his survival mechanism, General Kayani could well order the Americans to stop the drone program completely, the Pakistani said. \nThe Pakistanis have already blocked the supply of food and water to the base used for the drones, a senior American official said, adding that they were gradually \u201cstrangling the alliance\u201d by making things difficult for the Americans in Pakistan.\nThe turmoil within the Pakistani Army has engendered the lowest morale since it lost the war in 1971 against East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, army observers say. The anger and disillusionment stems from the fact that the Obama administration decided not to tell Pakistan in advance about the Bin Laden raid \u2014 and that Pakistan was then unable to detect or stop it. \nThat Bin Laden was living comfortably in Pakistan for years has evinced little outrage here among a population that has consistently told pollsters it is more sympathetic to Al Qaeda than to the United States.\nEven a well-known pro-American commander, Lt. Gen. Tariq Khan, who spent more than a year at Central Command headquarters in Tampa, Fla., after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks had fallen in line with the new ultranationalist sentiment against the Americans, a former army officer said. \nThe anger at the Americans was now making it more difficult for General Kayani to motivate the army to fight against the Pakistani Taliban in what is increasingly seen as a fight on behalf of the United States, former Pakistani soldiers said. \n\u201cThe feeling that they are fighting America\u2019s war against their own people has a negative impact on the fighting efficiency,\u201d said Javed Hussain, a former special forces officer in the Pakistani military. \nDiscipline has become a worry, as has an open rebellion in the middle ranks of officers, particularly as rumors circulate that some enlisted men have questioned whether General Kayani and his partner, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, the head of the chief spy agency, the Directorate for the Inter-Services Intelligence, should remain in their jobs. \nA special three-year extension General Kayani won in his position last year did not sit well among the rank and file who perceived it as having been pushed by the United States to keep its man in the top job. \n\u201cKeeping discipline in the lower ranks is a challenge,\u201d said Mr. Qadri, the retired army brigadier. \nGeneral Kayani\u2019s problems have been magnified by a groundswell of unprecedented criticism from the public, questioning both the army\u2019s competence and the lavish rewards for its top brass, something that also increasingly rankles modestly paid enlisted men. \n\u201cAdding to this frustration and public pique is the lifestyle that the top brass of all the services has maintained,\u201d Talat Hussain, a prominent journalist who generally writes favorably about the military, wrote in Monday\u2019s edition of the English-language newspaper Dawn. \u201cThis is not a guns versus butter argument, but a contrast between the reality of the life led by the military elite at state expense and the general situation for ordinary citizens.\u201d\nDespite the resources the army soaks up \u2014 about 23 percent of Pakistan\u2019s annual expenditures \u2014 it has appeared impotent since the May 2 raid. The infiltration three weeks later of the nation\u2019s largest naval base by Qaeda commandos that left at least 10 security officers dead added to the sense of disarray. \nAccording to the notes of a participant in the session at the National Defense University, General Kayani acknowledged that Pakistan had mortgaged itself to the United States. The participant declined to be identified because people at the session agreed that they would not divulge what was said. \nIn making the analogy to Pakistan as a mortgaged house, General Kayani said that if a person gave his house against a loan and was unable to pay back the loan, the mortgage holder would intervene, the participant said. \u201cWe are helpless,\u201d General Kayani said, according to the person\u2019s notes. \u201cCan we fight America?\u201d ",

    "text": "Qaddafi\u2019s Grip on the Capital Tightens as Revolt Grows\n2011-02-22T07:38:59.000Z\nTOBRUK, Libya \u0097 Vowing to track down and kill protesters \u201chouse by house,\u201d Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya tightened his grip on the capital, Tripoli, on Tuesday, but the eastern half of the country was slipping beyond his control.\nA bloody crackdown drove protesters from the streets of Tripoli, where residents described a state of terror. After a televised speech by Colonel Qaddafi, thousands of his supporters converged in the city\u2019s central Green Square, wearing green bandannas and brandishing large machetes.\n Many loaded into trucks headed for the outlying areas of the city, where they occupied traffic intersections and appeared to be massing for neighborhood-to-neighborhood searches.\n \u201cIt looks like they have been given a green light to kill these people,\u201d one witness said.\n Human Rights Watch said it had confirmed 62 deaths in two hospitals after a rampage on Monday night, when witnesses said groups of heavily armed militiamen and mercenaries from other African countries cruised the streets in pickup trucks, spraying crowds with machine-gun fire.\n The death toll was probably higher; one witness said militia forces appeared to be using vans to cart away bodies.\nBut as they clamped down on the capital, Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s security forces did not appear to make any attempt to take back the growing number of towns in the east that had in effect declared their independence and set up informal opposition governments. For now, there is little indication of what will replace the vacuum left by Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s authority in broad parts of the country other than simmering anarchy. \nOnly around the town of Ajdabiya, south of the revolt\u2019s center in Benghazi, were Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s security forces and militia still clashing with protesters along the road to the colonel\u2019s hometown, Surt. \nThe widening gap between the capital and the eastern countryside underscored the radically different trajectory of the Libyan revolt from the others that recently toppled Arab autocrats on Libya\u2019s western and eastern borders, in Tunisia and Egypt. \nThough the Libyan revolt began with a relatively organized core of longtime government critics in Benghazi, its spread to the capital was swift and spontaneous, outracing any efforts to coordinate the protests. \nColonel Qaddafi has lashed out with a level of violence unseen in either of the other uprisings, partly by importing foreigners without ties to the Libyan people. His four decades of idiosyncratic one-man rule have left the country without any national institutions \u0097 not even a unified or disciplined military \u0097 that could tame his retribution or provide the framework for a transitional government.\nCondemnations of his brutal crackdown mounted, from Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to the United Nations Security Council to the Arab League, which suspended Libya as a member. High-profile aides and diplomats continued to defect, among them Libya\u2019s interior minister and the country\u2019s ambassadors to the United States, India and Bangladesh. \nIn his second television appearance in two days, Colonel Qaddafi vowed on Tuesday to die as a martyr for his country. \u201cI will fight on to the last drop of my blood,\u201d he said. \nWearing a beige robe and turban and reading at times from his manifesto, the Green Book, Colonel Qaddafi called the protesters \u201ccockroaches\u201d and attributed the unrest shaking Libya to foreigners, a small group of people distributing pills, brainwashing and young people\u2019s na\u00efve desire to imitate the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia. \nHe urged citizens to take to the streets and beat back the protesters, and he described himself in sweeping, megalomaniacal terms. \u201cMuammar Qaddafi is history, resistance, liberty, glory, revolution,\u201d he declared. \nIn Tobruk, an eastern city that joined the uprising almost as soon as it began, a resident watching the speech in the main square reacted by throwing a rock at Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s face as it was broadcast on a large television. And in a cafe not far from Tobruk, Fawzi Labada, a bus driver, looked incredulously at the screen. \u201cHe is weak now,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a liar, a big liar. He will hang.\u201d \n In Tripoli, however, the reaction was more chastened. One resident reported the sound of gunfire during the speech \u0097 presumably in celebration, he said, but also in warning. \u201cHe is saying, \u2018If you go to protest, all the shots will be in your chest,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. \n\u201cWe are unarmed and his warning is very clear,\u201d he added. \u201cThe people are terrified now.\u201d\nThe gap between Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s stronghold in Tripoli and the insurrection in the east recalled Libya\u2019s pre-1931 past as three different countries \u0097 Tripolitania, Fezzan and Cyrenaica \u0097 and underscored the challenge facing its insurrection. \n Many analysts have suggested that Colonel Qaddafi seemed to fear the development of any national institutions or networks that might check his power, and he has kept even his military divided into battalions, each loyal mainly to its own officers. \n\n13 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nThat has set the stage for heavy defections during the revolt \u0097 rebels in the east said some government forces had simply abandoned their uniforms to join the cause. But it also means that Libya\u2019s military is unlikely to play the stabilizing role its Tunisian or Egyptian counterparts did.\nForeign companies and Libyan factions focused intensely on the fate of the country\u2019s substantial oil reserves. The Italian oil company Eni confirmed that it had suspended use of a pipeline from Libya to Sicily that provides 10 percent of Italy\u2019s natural gas. \nOpponents of Colonel Qaddafi tightened their control of their area around Ajdabiya, an important site in the oil fields of central Libya, said Tawfiq al-Shahbi, a protest organizer in Tobruk. \nTripoli remained under an information blackout, with no Internet access and limited and intermittent phone service. Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s government has sought to block all foreign journalists from entering the country or reporting on the revolt. \nBut the uprising in the east cracked open the country on Tuesday as the Libyan military retreated from the eastern border with Egypt and foreign journalists poured through. The road from the border to Tobruk appeared to be completely under the control of Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s opponents, and small, ragtag bands of men in worn fatigues ran easygoing checkpoints and flashed victory signs at visitors.\nExcept for those guards, there was little to suggest an uprising was under way. Shops were open along the road, which was full of traffic, mostly heading out of Libya. \nTobruk residents said neighboring cities \u0097 including Dernah, Al Qubaa, Bayda and El Marij \u0097 were also quiet, and effectively ruled by the opposition. \nThe government lost control of Tobruk almost immediately, according to Gamal Shallouf, a marine biologist who has become an informal press officer in the city.\n Soldiers took off their uniforms on Friday and Saturday, taking the side of protesters, who burned the police station and another government building, smashing a large stone monument of Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s Green Book. Four people were killed during clashes here, residents said. \n Salah Algheriani, who works for the state-owned Gulf Oil company, talked about the sea change in Tobruk, where everyone was suddenly full of loud opinions and hope, including the hope that young people might stop leaving the country for Europe. \n\u201cThe taste of freedom is very delicious,\u201d he said.\nThe protests began with a relatively organized network of families in Benghazi who had all lost relatives in a 1996 prison riot. Many were represented by the same lawyer, a prominent Qaddafi critic in the region, and his arrest last week set off their uprising. \nBut the revolt in Tripoli appears far more genuinely spontaneous and unorganized than the Benghazi uprising or, for that matter, the revolutions that toppled the leaders of Tunisia or Egypt. The lack of organization now raises questions about the ability of the mostly young rebels in the capital to regroup after the Qaddafi government\u2019s retaliation.\nProtesters in other parts of the country have vowed in recent days to send reinforcements to their fellow citizens in Tripoli, but Qaddafi supporters have set up roadblocks to prevent entry into the city. \nStill, even in Tripoli, some protesters who had retreated into their homes vowed that they would return to the street.\n \u201cIt is too late,\u201d one said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is prepared to listen to Qaddafi anymore, and it is not one town or one area. It is the whole country in an uprising.\u201d",

Italian bakeries and butcher shops were commonplace.\nNow those groups have smaller numbers, and many of their shops have been replaced by stores catering to the tastes of recent arrivals from Guyana, Colombia and Mexico, among other countries. \n\u201cThis has always been a place for relatively new immigrant families trying to get a foothold and assimilate,\u201d said Mr. Russo, 57, who has lived in Ozone Park for most of his life and runs a catering hall called Villa Russo just outside of the neighborhood. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened recently is no different.\u201d\nBut an even greater change is coming this year \u2014 one visible even from a distance, because of the cranes doing heavy construction: New York City\u2019s first casino. \nIt is being built at the Aqueduct race track, the 192-acre expanse straddling Ozone Park and South Ozone Park. Called Resorts World New York and developed by Genting New York, the casino will have 4,525 video slot machines.\nIt is not clear what its presence will mean for the neighborhood. Many residents are hopeful that it will bring jobs and money. \nLast month, the casino announced it would hire 1,150 permanent workers, 350 more than it had originally estimated. Hiring has started, the casino said, adding that local workers would be taken on before others. \n\u201cIt should be an economic engine for our community,\u201d said Mr. Russo, who since 1986 has lived in a colonial that cost around $190,000. He estimated that it was now worth about $450,000.\nFor decades the neighborhood has been largely working-class, a slightly downscale area compared with its southern neighbor, Howard Beach. The pizazz anticipated from the new casino is not a quality already much in evidence. Off the main thoroughfares, like Rockaway Boulevard and Cross Bay Boulevard, the streets are mostly serene. Noise, what there is of it, comes from the planes taking off and landing nearby at Kennedy International Airport.\nThe casino could therefore have all the more impact, especially if it brought a significant increase of traffic to the side streets.\n\u201cIf the traffic cuts through the center of the neighborhood, that\u2019ll hurt,\u201d said Jerry Fink, the owner of Jerry Fink Real Estate, who has sold property in the neighborhood for 14 years.\nThere is also concern that the crowds of gamblers could bring crime. \nLike the city as a whole, Ozone Park has had a sharp decrease in major crimes in the last 20 years. In the 106th Precinct, which covers much of the neighborhood, including the area around Aqueduct, crime has fallen 77 percent over that period. \nEric A. Ulrich, who grew up in the neighborhood and now represents it on the City Council, says he expects 30,000 visitors a day to Aqueduct once the casino opens. Well aware of the residents\u2019 concerns, he has been in talks with the precinct to prepare for the visitors.\nNot long ago, he said, \u201cthere was a general feeling that the neighborhood was in decline. But now I really see things changing for the better.\u201d \nWHAT YOU\u2019LL FIND\nThere is general agreement that neighborhood is circumscribed by Atlantic Avenue to the north and North Conduit Avenue to the south. The eastern boundary is usually recognized as 108th Street \u2014 give or take a few blocks in either direction \u2014 and the western section of Aqueduct. The Brooklyn border makes the line to the west.\nRoughly 50,000 people live in an area a little over a square mile in size. Whites remain prevalent, according to recent census figures; there are also large numbers of Hispanics and Asians from countries including Colombia, Bangladesh and the Philippines.\nThe neighborhood, its stability enhanced by being largely owner-occupied, has a family-friendly air, with play sets and toys in yards. The real estate is mostly single- and two-family detached colonials on lots large enough for a backyard and parking.\nAn architectural exception is the area known as Tudor Village, in the southwestern section. As the name implies, it is filled with brick Tudor-style houses, many of them attached. Another enclave, Centerville, lies in the southeast corner, near Aqueduct, and is filled with slightly larger homes. The prices in both Tudor Village and Centerville tend to be higher than in the rest of the neighborhood.\nBetween Tudor Village and Centerville is another anomaly for the neighborhood, Magnolia Court, a gated community built in the last decade. Prices of the 48 condominiums in the complex \u2014 duplexes and simplexes outfitted with granite countertops and other upscale touches \u2014 ranged from about $375,000 to $550,000. Magnolia Court was developed by the Ervolino Group, whose chief executive, Ronald Ervolino, grew up in Ozone Park and neighboring Howard Beach and still has family in the area. \n\u201cThe neighborhood didn\u2019t have that kind of community,\u201d Mr. Ervolino said. \u201cBut it\u2019s always been a very vibrant place,\u201d filled with people trying to work their way up the ladder.\n\u201cThe neighborhood has changed a lot,\u201d he added, \u201cbut its concept is the same.\u201d \nWHAT YOU\u2019LL PAY\nHouse prices have fallen as much as 25 percent, brokers say, since the height of the market several years ago. \nMany listings are short sales \u2014 a factor that is keeping prices down, said John Rodriguez, the broker-owner of Exit Realty Central, an agency in the neighborhood. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a buyer\u2019s market,\u201d was his assessment.\nTypical one-family houses, Mr. Rodriguez said, range from $375,000 to about $450,000. Two-families range from $475,000 to $600,000. A recent search of properties for sale found nearly 90 single-family houses and more than 100 multifamilies.\nHomes in the southern part of the neighborhood, including Tudor Village and Centerville, near Aqueduct, have a slightly higher price tag \u2014 about $400,000 to $600,000. \nBut even with the slowness in sales, said Mr. Fink of Jerry Fink Realty, the rental market is active, and he is among those expecting things to pick up after the casino opens. Two-bedroom rentals are priced around $1,400 a month, he said, and three-bedrooms run $1,500 or more. \nWHAT TO DO\nThe neighborhood is generously endowed with parks and playgrounds, including the London Planetree Playground, which has almost two acres, and the 24-acre Tudor Park. Rockaway Beach, a popular summer destination for residents, is a short bus ride away.\nLiberty Avenue and Cross Bay Boulevard are lined with retail stores, both small shops and chains like Modell\u2019s and Marshalls. Residents congregate at the restaurants here,among them Esquire Diner and Aldo\u2019s II Pizzeria.\nTHE SCHOOLS\nAmong local schools is Public School 64, which has about 650 enrolled in kindergarten through fifth grade. Last year, 50 percent of fourth graders met standards in reading and 64 percent in math. \nAt Public School 65, which serves the same age groups, 46 percent of fourth graders met standards in reading and 54 percent in math.\nJunior High School 210 has nearly 2,100 students. Last year, 45 percent of its eighth graders met standards in reading and 45 percent in math.\nJohn Adams High School sits on the eastern side of the neighborhood, near Aqueduct. Graduation rates there have increased recently, to 61 percent, just below the 63 percent citywide average. SAT averages last year were 424 in math, 399 in reading and 404 in writing, versus 462, 439 and 434 citywide.\nThe neighborhood also has several private and parochial schools, including Saint Mary Gate of Heaven School and Divine Mercy Catholic Academy. \nTHE COMMUTE\nThe A train makes several stops in the neighborhood. The commute to Midtown Manhattan takes about 45 minutes.\nThere are many buses to choose from; a handful, including the Q21 and Q41, which run along Cross Bay Boulevard, have stops near the Rockaway Boulevard A train station.\nTo the north, the Q8 runs along 101st Avenue and the Q24 along Atlantic Avenue. The Q7 serves the southwest, the Q11 the southeast. \nStill, many residents eschew public transportation in favor of their cars, a choice made easier by plentiful on-street parking. The Belt Parkway, along the neighborhood\u2019s southern border, provides easy access to many areas around the city.\nTHE HISTORY\nIn the late 1940s, Jack Kerouac wrote his first novel and plotted his travels for \u201cOn the Road\u201d in his family\u2019s walk-up apartment on Cross Bay Boulevard. \nPat Fenton, a writer who has tried to secure landmark status for the building, said Kerouac also spent time working in the drugstore on the building\u2019s ground floor and frequented a bar across the street that is now called Glen Patrick\u2019s Pub.",

    "text": "Arab League Endorses No-Flight Zone Over Libya\n2011-03-12T17:42:09.000Z\nCAIRO \u2014 The Arab League asked the United Nations Security Council on Saturday to impose a no-flight zone over Libya in hopes of halting Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi\u2019s attacks on his own people, providing the rebels a tincture of hope even as they were driven back from a long stretch of road and towns they had captured in the three-week war.\nThe extraordinary move by the 22-nation bloc \u2014 an extremely rare invitation for Western military forces on Arab territory \u2014 increases the pressure on the Obama administration, which has been reluctant to intervene in a war that could turn out to be prolonged and complex.\nHowever, by inviting the West to take such action, it also clears the way for the United States and Europe to press for a strong Security Council resolution and to counter the objections of China and Russia, which traditionally oppose foreign intervention in a country\u2019s internal disputes.\nBut the United States has not said whether it would pursue a resolution, and it was far from clear that, even if action were forthcoming, it would be enough to stall the march of Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s troops eastward. As the rebels withdrew from the strategic oil town of Ras Lanuf 100 miles east to Brega, and by nightfall on to Ajdabiya, superior government forces pressed their advantage on an insurgency that began as a disparate protest movement and, despite efforts to build a government and an army, remained chaotic, splintered and largely leaderless.\nThe government sweep intensified pleas from the rebels for Western military support. Abdul Hafidh Ghoga, the vice chairman of the rebels\u2019 shadow government, the Libyan National Council, said a no-flight zone would give the rebels a fighting chance against Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s better organized and better equipped military.\n\u201cWe feel we have the right to ask for help,\u201d he said in the rebel\u2019s eastern stronghold of Benghazi, Libya, where a cheer went up when the Arab League vote was announced. \u201cIf the international community chooses to play the role of bystander, we will have to defend ourselves.\u201d\nEven if the Security Council authorized the measure, American officials have said it would be warranted only if it appeared that Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s forces were effectively relying on warplanes. A no-flight zone, they have said, would have little effect against helicopters or artillery, both of which the Libyan government has used extensively.\nThe White House, in a statement on Saturday, said it welcomed the Arab League decision, \u201cwhich strengthens the international pressure on Qaddafi and support for the Libyan people.\u201d But the statement did not mention a no-flight zone.\nThe defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, has largely dismissed such a zone as ineffective and ill-advised. Other administration officials have said that the level of violence in Libya would have to approach the scale of that in Rwanda or Bosnia in the 1990s before the United States would engage militarily.\nAn effective no-flight zone would require a leading Western role. No one else, with the possible exception of Russia, has the level of military sophistication, firepower and surveillance ability it would take to first disable Libyan air defenses, and then enforce the zone.\nAmerican officials also said that the Arab League would have to do more than endorse action \u2014 it would have to participate in it, too. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they have to fly airplanes,\u201d one official said, \u201cbut there is much they can do, from providing airfields to gas and maintenance.\u201d\nAt the Security Council, a diplomat from one member nation said the Arab League decision was \u201chelpful, but there are quite a lot of reservations around the council table still.\u201d\nThe objections, including some from Russia and China, have centered on questions about whether the need for a no-flight zone has been demonstrated, and whether it has a strong legal basis and clear regional support.\nThe Arab League action checked one condition off the list, the diplomat said, but the others remain unsettled.\nThe Europeans have also been divided and have said that Arab League backing was critical to their ultimate decision. The European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, was expected in Cairo on Sunday to discuss the no-flight decision with the Arab League.\nAmr Moussa, the secretary general of the Arab League, said that a no-flight zone would protect ordinary people. \u201cOur one goal is to protect the civilian population in Libya after what has been reported of attacks and casualties in a very bloody situation,\u201d he said at a news conference after the vote.\nMr. Moussa said that he and other Arab League delegates were shocked by recent statements in Tripoli about the group. He was referring to a derogatory statement about the league made last week by Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s son Seif al-Islam al-Qaddafi. After dismissing both \u201cArabs\u201d and the Arab League, he said Libya did not need the league and did not even need Arab workers, but would rely on Bangladeshis and other Asians.\nThe measure did not pass without tense debate. Syria and Algeria, in particular, argued that foreign intervention would destabilize the region.\nSyria\u2019s ambassador, Youssef Ahmed, said Arab states should oppose any step that \u201cviolates the sovereignty, independence and unity of Libyan territory.\u201d\nThose objections appeared to account for wording in the resolution that the Arab League rejected \u201cforeign intervention,\u201d and Mr. Moussa\u2019s caveat that the action end as soon as the crisis is over.\nThe League has suspended Libya\u2019s membership and opened contact with the rebels through the Libyan National Council, but it stopped short of recognizing the shadow government as the country\u2019s legitimate authority.\nIn Libya, the government\u2019s growing confidence was apparent as it took a contingent of foreign journalists to the battlefields of the recently recaptured cities of Bin Jawwad and Ras Lanuf.\nOn the road, several burned pickups bore witness to the fighting. A machine gun mounted on one was still smoldering.\n\n11 Photos\nView Slide Show \u203a\nBin Jawwad, the rebels\u2019 furthest foothold \u2014 now lost \u2014 appeared all but deserted by residents. A small, green government flag decorated a blown-out house amid a sea of burned-out cars. The police station and school were badly damaged by shelling and fire. Walls and ceilings of the many of the low cinderblock houses were caved in. The heaviest damaged faced west, suggesting the blows had come from advancing Qaddafi forces.\nThree men in town \u2014 virtually the only ones present not in uniform \u2014 told the same improbable story: that the damage was done by a small band of bearded, drugged-up Islamic terrorists, many of them foreigners, who had taken the town hostage until it was rescued by Qaddafi forces.\nIn Ras Lanuf, the journalists were taken to a ransacked hospital where a trail of blood drops led to a puddle in the lobby. A stretcher and hospital supplies had been dumped outside. The soldiers blamed rebels for whatever had happened, which remained unclear. At the giant refinery, a vast fire was burning unchecked at an oil storage facility, sending a thick cloud of black smoke flowing about 50 miles along the Mediterranean coast. Officers in charge of the Qaddafi forces said retreating rebels had set it ablaze, but that could not confirmed. Pilots loyal to Colonel Qaddafi had also bombed the area.\nThe Qaddafi forces appeared to include armed Bedouin tribesman, some of whom were camped by the road. Some of the soldiers identified themselves as members of the Warfalla, Maghraha and Qadhadhfa tribes \u2014 three pillars of support for the Qaddafi government that have provided many of his security forces. They said they had come from Sobha and Surt, bastions of Qaddafi support.\nThe satellite television channel Al Jazeera reported that one of its cameramen, Ali Hassan al-Jaber, was killed after gunmen fired on a car that he and his colleagues were traveling in. The journalists were attacked on the outskirts of Benghazi, the channel reported.\nIt was not clear if their attackers knew they were journalists.\nThe Qaddafi government\u2019s statements about the uprising have often focused on blaming Al Jazeera and its counterpart Al Arabiya for lying about the violence and stirring up trouble. Rowdy crowds of Qaddafi supporters often chant about Al Jazeera\u2019s crimes.\nIn Brega, the mood was grim as fighters formed a line to carry ammunition out of a makeshift depot along the road, loading boxes onto a flatbed truck headed to Ajdabiya. By nightfall, rebel checkpoints along the road to Ajdabiya were manned by far fewer fighters than in recent days.\nIn Benghazi, Omar al-Hariri, the rebel defense minister, insisted the rebels would be able to defend the city \u201cwith weapons and also with our bodies.\u201d A former army captain who was jailed by Colonel Qaddafi, Mr. Hariri said that the opposition was taking steps to better organize their youthful volunteers into \u201ca military force.\u201d\n\u201cWe will fight, and we are powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know how to win, with God\u2019s will.\u201d",

    "text": "Predictions for the Year Ahead\n2011-01-07T12:39:12.000Z\nBOSTON \u2014 An editor once told me that nobody wants to read about last year\u2019s predictions and that I should just get on with \u201cmaking a hash\u201d of this year\u2019s predictions.\nTrouble is, I actually got a few right last time around after 10 years of doing this. So I suppose it\u2019s not worth mentioning that I picked Spain to win its first World Cup, Europe to regain the Ryder Cup and Larry Ellison and BMW Oracle Racing to out-litigate, outspend and out-sail Ernesto Bertarelli and Alinghi to win the America\u2019s Cup.\nAnd it\u2019s definitely not worth mentioning that I thought Michael Schumacher would win a Formula One race (he did not come close) or that Roman Abramovich would finally get his money\u2019s worth (Chelsea faltered again in the Champions League) or that the San Diego Chargers would finally get their Super Bowl (I grew up in San Diego) or that Tiger Woods would recover from his self-inflicted troubles in time to win another British Open at St. Andrews (Louis Oosthuizen was the one who played like a Tiger even though his nickname is Shrek).\nA deep breath then, and I\u2019m off to make a hash of 2011:\n January  England\u2019s cricketers retain the Ashes (Let\u2019s build confidence with a done deal), and English high and low society spend much of the month gloating and debating the length of Alastair Cook\u2019s eyelashes.\nAustralians console themselves with their superior historical record and far superior weather. They get further consolation in their summer when their women\u2019s tennis players, Sam Stosur and Jarmila Groth, both make deep runs at an Australian Open won by Kim Clijsters, who used to be considered half Aussie until she broke up with Lleyton Hewitt and married an American.\nRafael Nadal wins the men\u2019s event to complete the \u201cRafa Slam\u201d by holding all four major titles simultaneously. The true Grand Slam will have to wait, but another vigil ends at soccer\u2019s Asian Cup in Doha. The South Koreans take the title for the first time since 1960 in pleasant weather that accelerates lobbying for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar to be moved to January, when air-conditioning is optional and players and fans might actually enjoy themselves.\n February  The Chargers are not even in the playoffs, so no risk of family ties clouding my judgment. This year\u2019s Super Bowl champions should be the New England Patriots and their pretty-boy quarterback Tom Brady, but then that\u2019s too obvious, so let\u2019s have more fun and pick the Pittsburgh Steelers and bad-boy quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. No sense picking against Lindsey Vonn at the world Alpine ski championships. The American will dominate the women\u2019s speed events, but her good friend and Christmas host, Maria Riesch, skiing on home snow in Germany, will get golds of her own and then get the better of Vonn for the first time in the overall World Cup.\n March  With 20 races, the Formula One season that starts in Bahrain is the longest in history, and Schumacher still doesn\u2019t win any of them. Serena Williams returns to action after an eight-month injury break and fails to regain dominance or win a Grand Slam singles title in 2011. Nordic skiing comes home to Norway for its world championships. But though Marit Bjoergen wins plenty of cross-country races, Norway suffers on the rebuilt Holmenkollen ski jump as Thomas Morgenstern of Austria flies farthest. Nor is home support enough to help Mao Asada overcome Kim Yu-na in Tokyo at the world figure skating championships, but Daisuke Takahashi does give Japan an emotional gold in the men\u2019s singles. \n April  A cricket World Cup that started in Bangladesh in February ends in Mumbai, and to the delight of one host nation, India wins it all, giving 37-year-old Sachin Tendulkar the big one-day prize that one of history\u2019s greatest batsmen deserves. At the Masters, Tiger Woods \u2014 perhaps taken aback that people only want to talk about golf this year \u2014 struggles early, then recovers, but still fails to break his two-year winless streak in the majors. So it will go all season, as Europeans like Martin Kaymer and Graeme McDowell continue to ride high.\n May  Shane Mosley would once have been a genuine threat to Manny Pacquiao, but Mosley is 39 now, with the scars and reflexes to show for it. In short, he is no Floyd Mayweather Jr., which is too bad for boxing but just fine for Mosley\u2019s bank account as he cashes in and gets beaten up in Las Vegas while the sports world waits \u2014 and waits \u2014 for the Pacquaio-Mayweather matchup to materialize. In Europe, the big event actually happens, and it comes at Wembley Stadium, where Barcelona wins its latest Champions League title in the same place \u2014 if not quite the same stadium \u2014 where it won its first European Cup in 1992. It is a full-circle moment, above all, for the coach Pep Guardiola, who was a player on that 1992 team. In other soccer news, FIFA \u2014 tired of controversy, corruption concerns and ill-timed comments \u2014 decides to deny Sepp Blatter a fourth term as president (just kidding; this is FIFA).\n June  The N.B.A. finals get the star-powered matchup they crave: Kobe Bryant and the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers against LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and the Miami Heat. A true team by now, the Heat are the fresher, quicker group, and the \u201cThree Kings\u201d celebrate together just as the rest of the league feared they would when they chose friendship and loads of money over individualism and even more money. In the N.H.L., the Vancouver Canucks win the Stanley Cup, with the identical Sedin twins setting the tone. Hard as it is to believe, it is the first Canadian club to win in 18 years.\n July  Germany stages another successful soccer World Cup, and just like in 2006, the Germans don\u2019t win. Their powerhouse women lose in the final in Frankfurt, as Marta and Brazil win their first major trophy for a nation that once dismissed women\u2019s soccer. The Brazilian men lose the Copa America as Argentina wins at home. Back in South Africa, the International Olympic Committee selects the South Korean city of Pyeongchang as host city of the 2018 Winter Games over Munich and Annecy, France, which suffer for the glut of European Olympics in recent years. At Wimbledon, Roger Federer wins for the seventh time as Nadal misses the tournament with an injury. Three years after Michael Phelps won eight Olympic golds in Beijing, a different American \u2014 Ryan Lochte \u2014 is the irresistible force at the world swimming championships in Shanghai. Andy Schleck is still unclear about whether he won or lost the 2010 Tour de France because of a legal delay concerning Alberto Contador\u2019s positive drug test. But Schleck wins the 2011 Tour outright \u2014 at least for now \u2014 in a race missing Contador and the re-retired Lance Armstrong, who spends part of 2011 with a grand jury.\n August  The world track and field championships open in South Korea\u2019s fourth-largest city, Daegu \u2014 little known worldwide \u2014 but Usain Bolt and Tyson Gay command worldwide attention with their duel in the 100. Bolt, fighting nagging injuries and distractions, loses this time, but the world record remains his. After canceling the exhibition season, the N.F.L. barely averts a strike with a final-hour agreement in which the players get a bigger percentage of profits and the league gets two extra regular-season games.\nThere are reports of concussions sustained by the negotiators.\n September  Andy Murray and Vera Zvonareva win their first Grand Slam singles titles at the U.S. Open. Bolt closes out the meet in Daegu by winning the 200 and then running the curve for Jamaica\u2019s gold medalists in the 4-by-100 relay. After a sabbatical year, Yelena Isinbayeva wins the women\u2019s pole vault, and on the administrative front, I.A.A.F. president Lamine Diack decides that at age 78 he will surrender power willingly and not stand for a fourth term so that younger men like Sergei Bubka and Sebastian Coe can have a turn (just kidding; this is the I.A.A.F.).\n October  The All Blacks have roared their terrible roars and danced their terrible haka and then crumbled under pressure at too many World Cups, leaving fellow New Zealanders to feel as if they live in the land of the long, dark doom cloud. But the All Blacks have never lost the big one at home, and just as they did in the inaugural edition in 1987, they will win the rugby World Cup in Auckland, giving the Kiwis their biggest source of pride since the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d trilogy.\n November  Men\u2019s golf has been a trans-Atlantic affair as Americans and Europeans have dominated the business end of the world rankings list, but the Australians and their captain, Greg Norman, will relish the occasion to play the Presidents Cup on one of their best courses: Royal Melbourne. In an upset, they and their international teammates, including Oosthuizen and Ernie Els, beat Woods and the jet-lagged Americans. But there is no upset in F-1, as Sebastian Vettel successfully defends his driver\u2019s title.\n December  The draw for next year\u2019s Euro finals takes place in Kiev, and the better news is that the Euro is \u2014 after many a sweaty palm at UEFA headquarters \u2014 really going to take place in Ukraine and Poland in 2012. More good news: All the European powers have qualified, even France, mutinous no more under its new manager, Laurent Blanc.",
