M. Ershad said on Wednesday that the death toll was 250, but the Government's count usually is considered low.\nDhaka, a city of four million, is virtually cut off from the rest of the country. The Ministry of Communications said 18 highways leading out of the capital were closed because of flooding. A fourth of the city was under water, at depths that ranged from a few inches to several feet.

But last year's floods, which killed about 1,600 people, were described as the worst in 70 years, and this year's devastation is believed to be greater still.\nPresident H. M. Ershad was quoted as saying today that this year's flood ''is far worse than the last year's,'' and added: ''Nobody knows whether this devastation has any parallel in the subcontinent's history.''\nForeign Minister Humayun Rashid Chowdhury told the heads of diplomatic missions in Dhaka that the floods had caused enormous damage to crops and communications networks.\n''This year's flood is more than a natural disaster,'' he said. ''It is an aberration of nature in which 25 million people have lost their homes, and communications networks disrupted totally.''\n''Bangladesh will need about three million tons of additional food grains on top of what is already committed as regular assistance,'' he said, ''to feed nearly half of the country's population for four months before the next crop is expected.''\nMore than 50 people died today, putting the death toll above 500, officials said. Some unofficial estimates put the toll at more than 1,200, but the collapse of communications has made it virtually impossible to get an authoritative assessment. Mr. Chowdhury said there was no sign of any easing of the flooding crisis, adding: ''All major rivers are flowing above danger marks. The human misery and suffering are unbearable.''\nFloods engulfed more than half of the capital, drenching the homes of a third of the city's six million residents.\nOfficials said earlier that thousands of families huddling on river embankments or clinging to their submerged houses could starve to death unless supplies reached them soon. An estimated 10 million people faced starvation or death from poisonous snakes and disease, they added.\nBangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries, has so far received promises of more than $600,000 worth of rice and cash from Pakistan, the United States and Australia.

Dhaka newspapers put the death toll from flooding at 1,451. The Government's count was 630.\nOfficials reported an outbreak of diarrhea in all areas affected by the floods. By Friday evening at least 160,872 people had been afflicted by the illness and 102 had died from it, the officials said. In Dhaka, a city of 6 million, 21,412 new cases of diarrhea were reported Friday by the Government.\nThe rains Friday and early today added to hardships already suffered by millions living on roofs and treetops and huddled together in thousands of camps nationwide without safe drinking water, cooked food or medical care.\nHealth Ministry officials said 30,035 health workers were working to aid victims of water-borne diseases.\nThe officials acknowledged that there was not enough medicine to help all of those affected by the flooding.\nA senior official at the Agriculture Ministry said that ''if the water does not recede in the next couple of days, most of the rice crop will be damaged beyond any recovery.''\nThe Government has 1.3 million tons of grain and has issued an appeal for 3 million tons to compensate for damage to the rice crop. FLOODS CALLED MAN-MADE\nROME, Sept. 10 (Reuters) - The disastrous floods sweeping Bangladesh are now an unstoppable annual event and largely man-made, a United Nations expert said. The official, Tom Elhaut, director of projects in Bangladesh for the International Fund for Agricultural Development, said Friday that deforestation and soil erosion in the Himalayas has removed natural barriers to the monsoon rains and that dikes built to shield development projects have only increased the devastation.\nLast year's severe flooding in Bangladesh was said to be the worst in decades, but was thought to be a freak occurrence. Mr. Elhaut said that catastrophic flooding may become the norm. 'Bound to Recur'\n''This phenomenon is bound to recur,'' he said. ''These are the first two years of a sustained series of catastrophic floods.''\nHe said that this year the problem has grown worse because snow continued to melt in the Himalayas longer than usual and rainfall has been particularly heavy.\nBut he asserted that the environmental havoc wreaked by the destruction of Nepalese forests has done the most damage. ''It is to a large extent manmade,'' Mr. Elhaut said.\nA population increase in Nepal has increased demand for wood faster than trees can be replaced, and growing numbers of animals are eroding the remaining grasslands.\nThe resulting deforestation insures that rain and silt will rush into Bangladesh unchecked.\nOn Thursday, the Dhaka Government called for an international conference on controlling the flood problem, but Mr. Elhaut was skeptical that immediate results could be achieved."}, {"text": "Bangladesh Thwarted On Area Flood Control\n1988-09-30T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Indian Government today deflected pleas from Bangladesh for an international approach to flood control in South Asia and announced instead that there would be another joint Indian-Bangladeshi study of river waters.\nIn a statement tonight after more than six hours of talks here between Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Bangladesh's President, H. M. Ershad, the Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman said a task force of experts from the two countries would be set up.\nThe Indian press has accused Bangladesh of ingratitude for Indian assistance during the recent flood, while Bangladesh has asserted that India was lax in controlling floodwaters.\nBangladesh, which suffered one of the worst floods in its history this year, with more than 1,000 dead and three-quarters of the country's farmland inundated, called earlier this month for an international study of the rivers of the region."}, {"text": "Bangladeshi Asks for Help on Controlling Floods\n1988-10-11T05:00:00.000Z\nIn an appeal to the General Assembly, the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh said today that a permanent solution to the country's annual flood disasters must be reached through regional cooperation with international support.\nThe remarks of the Bangladeshi minister, Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, were seen as an implicit criticism of India, which has thus far resisted any ''internationalization'' of the issue.\nAfter last month's devastating flood, which was the worst in the country's history, the President of Bangladesh, Lieut. Gen. H. M. Ershad, reached individual agreements with India and other neighboring countries for cooperation. But he has thus far failed to win sufficient support for a regional response to the flooding.\n''What we want is a regional water authority, including the five concerned countries, to regulate and harness water resources for the benefit of all,'' Mr. Choudhury said in an interview before his address. This would mean no diversion of water, construction of dams or other such projects, without common consent, he said. Looking to Dutch and Germans\nHe said such a regional agency would need international support both in technology and financing because of the magnitude of the problem. Specifically, it would look for technological help from the Netherlands and West Germany, ''which have cooperated successfully in taming the Rhine,'' he said.\nBangladesh and India have been at odds for some time over the control of the waters of the Brahmaputra, the Ganges and other common rivers. Bangladesh accuses India of permitting rampant deforestation that has resulted in flooding, and building dams that divert badly needed water from Bangladesh in the dry season. Specifically, these officials are concerned over an Indian proposal to build a canal across Bangladesh to drain water from the Brahmaputra to the Ganges system.\nThe Bangladeshi official said his Government has tried to generate enthusiasm for regional cooperation. Ershad and Gandhi Meet\nHe noted that General Ershad and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India agreed late last month to set up a joint task force to study the flood management and water flow of the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers. Subsequently, the President visited Nepal, and it was agreed to set up a joint study team on the problem. He will also visit Bhutan this week and later China to take up the same issue.\nReferring to the recent catastrophic flood, Mr. Choudhury said 1,250,000 houses were destroyed, leaving about eight million people homeless. More than 2,000 deaths have been attributed to the flooding.\nThe Foreign Minister said the country's ''highest priority needs'' are now wheat and construction materials.\nEmphasizing the need for a permanent solution to the problem, he said, ''The primary imperative will be in harnessing regional cooperation among all our concerned neighbors with a view to arriving at coherent and well-coordinated policies and plans to our mutual benefit.''"}, {"text": "BANGLADESH GETS PLEDGE OF MILLIONS FOR FLOOD RELIEF\n1988-09-07T05:00:00.000Z\nDonor nations have pledged millions of dollars in aid to Bangladesh, where the worst flooding in 70 years has left much of the country under water and as many as 28 million people homeless or stranded.\nAfter an urgent international appeal for aid by the President of Bangladesh, Lieut. Gen. H.M. Ershad, the United States has initially pledged nearly $3.6 million in food, transportation and other emergency aid, the State Department spokesman, Charles E. Redman, said today.\n''We continue to be in touch with Bangladesh authorities to see what other assistance we might be able to provide,'' he said. Japan Pledges $13 Million\nJapan, which has now surpassed the United States as the world's largest foreign aid donor, has pledged $13 million in food and money for the lease of two helicopters and medical equipment. A Japanese medical team has already arrived in Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Embassy in Washington said.\nThe flooding, brought on by brutal monsoon rains that began in June, has brought even more misery to one of the world's poorest countries and, with 110 million people in a land the size of Wisconsin, one of its most densely populated.\nThe most common estimate of the amount of land still under water is 75 percent, the figure used by the State Department and the Bangladesh Embassy here. CARE, which is represented in 80 percent of the country's 65 districts, said 75 to 90 percent of the county was under water. A Village in Trouble\nOne flooded village is Nichkasia, south of the capital, Dhaka, where no relief had been distributed by today and more than 8,000 people were forced to take shelter on a river embankment. A helicopter trip to the area showed water stretching as far as the eye could see, interrupted by treetops and tin roofs, some packed with victims of the flooding. [ Page A8. ] So far, relief officials have been unable to get to most flooded areas, and communications between the capital and outlying regions are spotty at best. The devastation will take weeks to assess. Most relief officials agree that only as the water levels decline will the problems in aiding a homeless population exposed to waterborne disease become evident.\n''Bangladesh is one vast swamp and what you're confronted with is rebuilding a country,'' said Thomas Drahman, the Asia regional manager for CARE. ''I hate to sound hyperbolic, but this could be one of the largest natural disasters of the century.'' Casualty Figures Uncertain\nThere is no reliable estimate of what it will cost to feed, house and provide medical care to the population and rebuild roads, buildings and bridges, but $4.5 billion was the total estimate of damage for the flood last year, which was not nearly as severe.\nInformation is so unreliable that it has been impossible to estimate casualty figures. The official death count of more than 400, from drowning, house collapse and snake bites, is widely regarded as far too low.\nBecause so little is known about the condition of the country, some donors like the United States have been reluctant to pour in large amounts of money and aid until they can consult with relief officials on the most crucial needs.\nAccording to the Agency for International Development, Australia has pledged $241,000, Pakistan $568,000, Britain $927,000 and various United Nations agencies $115,000.\nCanada has pledged about $4 million for food aid and Denmark $275,000, according to the Bangladesh Embassy, which added that India and Saudi Arabia have each lent four helicopters and Kuwait has offered to send four jumbo jets filled with relief materials once the Dhaka airport fully reopens.\nWhy Japan has made such a generous initial pledge was unclear and embassy officials in Washington could not confirm the $13 million figure. But in recent months, Japan has emerged as a champion of the developing nations of Asia, by such actions as initiating its own plan for debtor nations at the Toronto summit meeting and sending money as well as personnel to United Nations peacekeeping operations in Iran and Afghanistan. Immediate Needs Listed\n''Our immediate requirement is ready-to-eat high-protein dry food because people have no cooking oil, kerosene or firewood and cannot cook,'' said Tajul Islam, press attache at the Bangladesh Embassy. ''We also urgently need water purification tablets, medicine for the prevention of diarrhea and anti-snake venom.''\nAfter that, officials in Bangladesh estimate, the country will need three million extra tons of food grains to make up for the lost harvests until January.\nAlthough no deaths by starvation have been reported, private relief agency officials fear that a sizable percentage of the country's 110 million people will suffer malnutrition and even starvation because of the flood, as well as life-threatening waterborne diseases such as cholera.\nFinally, the country will need construction materials for an unparalleled reconstruction effort, including homes, buildings, roads and bridges. Even Worse Conditions Feared\n''It's a major disaster,'' said Rene Bafalis, a spokeswoman for A.I.D.'s Office of United States Foreign Disaster Assistance, which is coordinating United States Government aid efforts. ''We expect it to get worse before it gets better.''\nOverall flood conditions in the country showed some signs of improvement today, Mr. Redman said, as water levels in two major northern river basins and in Dhaka showed declines. But he said that a number of tributaries feeding into major basins have risen in the last 24 hours, ''indicating that the situation could change rapidly.''\nIn addition, ''fuel and essential goods may become increasingly scarce,'' Mr. Redman said.\nThe nearly $3.6 million pledged in aid by the United States includes 10,000 tons of food valued at $2.5 million, more than 2,000 tons of corn and wheat seed valued at up to $1 million, $50,000 to CARE, $40,000 to Save the Children for food and water purification tablets and $25,000 to be used at the discretion of the United States Ambassador, Willard A. De Pree.\nA.I.D. is also preparing to send disaster management experts to Dhaka to advise on further ways the United States can help the relief effort."}, {"text": "Flood-Ravaged Bangladesh Seeks Plan to Control Rivers\n1988-09-09T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Government of Bangladesh, reacting to what may be the worst flood of the country's history, called today for an international panel of experts to devise plans to control the rivers of South Asia.\nAt a news conference here tonight, Bangladesh's Minister of Information, Mahbubur Rahman, announced that the Foreign Minister, Humayun Rashid Chowdhury, had called for the prompt convening of an international panel so that a plan for the river systems could be discussed in December at a summit meeting of nations in the region.\nEarlier today, in an interview in a badly stricken area near the northern outpost of Ghatail, close to the Indian border, Mr. Rahman said that his country would seek to draw Nepal, Bhutan and India into substantive talks on the river systems.\nHe added that ''involving China may also be ultimately necessary,'' because of the proximity of Tibet.\nIt is in areas like Ghatail that the toll of the flooding, which began late last month, is most starkly revealed. Officials there think it will be three to six months before something resembling a normal existence returns. 'A Terrible Human Tragedy'\nBrig. Gen. Subed Ali Bhuya and his infantry brigade there are feeding and housing nearly 30,000 people, 12,000 head of cattle and innumerable chickens and goats. ''Their houses were washed away,'' the general said today of the people who have converged on his garrison since Aug. 30, leading cattle and carrying what they could salvage of their homes. ''It was a terrible human tragedy.''\nThe flooding this year is unlike the expected annual inundation that comes with the monsoon season. It has been a sudden flood ''out of season,'' destroying the barriers and embankments that this impoverished country has managed to construct.\nBangladesh is on the receiving end of mighty river systems - among them the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Jamuna and Meghna - that descend from the Himalayas. From ancient times, it has been destined to suffer major floods with great regularity.\nAdding to the problem in modern times, the great mountains of South Asia have become increasingly denuded and eroded in many places, and the cascade of earth and water each year grows more devastating to Bangladesh, which sprawls over delta after delta at the rivers' mouths.\nIf an international effort were to be mounted to control the rivers, the task would be mammoth, not only because of the technical challenges involved but also because of regional politics. India Called Key to Effort\nNo effective plan can be drawn up without the active support of the regional power, India. Although Bangladesh has sought to involve other neighbors, especially Nepal, where deforestation has also contributed to problems downriver, India continues to insist that the rivers are a matter for direct negotiation between New Delhi and Dhaka. But joint commissions have produced no comprehensive improvement.\nIn addition, relations between China and India have been cool since they fought a border war in the 1960's, and diplomats think India would be unlikely to welcome Chinese involvement in such talks.\nThe Government of Bangladesh today was decribing the floods as ''an unprecedented human tragedy.'' [ The Indian Government announced that it was sending two transport aircraft to drop food supplies to flood victims in Bangladesh.\nAn Indian spokesman said the craft are to carry about 30 tons of foodgrains on Friday and that four Indian helicopters already are assisting in relief work. ] No Place to Land a Helicopter In Ghatail, which is in one of the most severely affected parts of the country, nearly 100 percent of the farmland was under water today.\n''There is no place to land even a helicopter,'' General Bhuya said of the outlying villages in this area in the Tangail district, nearly 100 miles north of Dhaka. Reporters were brought to the general's headquarters by a Bangladesh Air Force helicopter.\nAll of the district's 384,309 people have been dislocated, General Bhuya said. At least 247,670 houses have been damaged or destroyed.\nThe situation is as bad or worse across three-fourths of Bangladesh's land area and for most of the country's 110 million people. Unlike Ghatail, many other areas have no military base where refuge can be sought.\nAmala Hussain, waiting with her seven children for a meal of rice taken from the rations of the men at the Ghatail garrison, said today that throughout her life of hardship as the wife of a landless tenant farmer she had ''never seen anything like this.''\nAt the garrison, medical treatment is administered by army doctors and there is clean water to drink, but when flood victims return home they will have no medicine to fight disease or snake bites. The national death toll from all causes during the flooding now stands at about 510."}, {"text": "U.N.

Morris, the A.I.D. deputy administrator, concludes that the United States should immediately provide an additional $20 million in 80,000 tons of food aid, between $1 million and $2 million in urgently needed medical supplies, oral rehydration salts and water purification tablets as well as other disaster and surveillance assistance.\nThe report also recommends that the aid agency develop a plan with other countries to rehabilitate Bangladesh and address the long-term causes of flooding in the region.\n''It is a disaster of historic proportions, mind-numbing,'' said Mr. Morris, who returned last week from a six-day tour of the flood-ravaged country. ''I don't really know how to describe it except to say that it's certainly the largest flood I could ever imagine.'' During his visit, Mr. Morris met with officials, relief workers and flood victims and delivered a letter from President Reagan to President H. M. Ershad expressing concern and a promise ''to do what we can to help.''\nAs part of its relief effort, the United States has already speeded up the availability of about $150 million in aid to Bangladesh, including food aid, disaster relief supplies and local currency earnings.\nThe report stressed that the full effect of the flood and the ultimate needs of the people of Bangladesh will become known only over the next few months. It predicted the possibility of ''significant loss of life and degradation of human welfare over the next three to six months.''\nOfficials in Bangladesh say millions of people in the capital, Dhaka, have been exposed to disease by drinking contaminated water. #25 Million Homeless The flood has so far claimed 1,000 lives, according to official figures, but unofficial estimates put the dead at 2,000 or more. The Bangladeshi Government says that a fourth of the deaths were caused by diarrhea, and that the others were caused by drowning, building collapses and snake bites.\nAccording to the A.I.D. report, 25 million people lost their homes in the flood, which inundated five million acres of rice land and damaged 43,000 miles of roads."}, {"text": "Bangladeshi - and Proud\n1988-11-17T05:00:00.000Z\nIt is not easy being a Bangladeshi these days. While our country is going under - literally and figuratively - the international community has responded with generous aid as well as a strong dose of cynicism and sarcasm. Ever since Henry Kissinger dehumanized Bangladesh by labeling it ''an international basket case,'' Bangladesh has been the butt of many cruel jokes.\nWe have been accused of behaving as though the world owes us a living. When cyclones lash out at our seacoast, killing thousands, it is because of our ''fatalistic attitude.'' I have heard Bangladesh blasted as the ''most backward country on earth.'' I have seen it kicked around as ''Bang-the-dish'' in satirical cartoons.\nYet, not so long ago, Bangladesh was the breadbasket of the region. In pre-industrial days, our prosperity earned us the name ''Golden Bengal.'' Every inch of land was cultivated for two and three crops each year. Life was so easy that neighboring Indians settled in droves on this fertile plain. Everyone stayed put, with the result that now 100 million people are jammed into an area the size of Wisconsin.\nThe massive deforestation and the construction of numerous river dams in India and Nepal has a lot to do with the recent floods in Bangladesh. Bangladesh is a delta through which the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent discharges its water to the sea.\nDuring the monsoon rains, some flooding is inevitable and is actually beneficial for the paddy fields. But when combined with an overflow from dams, the rivers - which have not been dredged recently because of the prohibitive cost - cannot discharge the water to the sea fast enough. Consequently, the water backs up, submerging a very flat, sea level country. Our neighbors, who consistently refuse to discuss a solution to our flood problem, share some moral responsibility for our misery.\nWe Bangladeshis are a proud people, famous for our poetry, songs and cuisine - maybe the best in the world. We may be poor, but we are not backward.\nThe civil war with Pakistan in 1971 completely destroyed our land's infrastructure. It took a monumental effort to get the country back on its feet. The hot, humid climate is not conducive to heavy, prolonged physical labor. Saddled with the burden of feeding millions, our development plans have to be scrapped regularly because of catastrophes like this year's.\nBut our population control plan is in place and births are decreasing. Given a stable, representative political system - already within reach -and a few flood-free years, our genius will make us rebound.\nThe land that produced literary giants like Rabindranath Tagore, the first Asian to win the Nobel Prize, and poet laureate Kazi Nazrul Islam, will not stay down for long.\nIn the meantime, as we fight to save our people from disease and starvation, we ask the international community to be helpful and understanding - and not to indulge in ridicule and pontification."}, {"text": "Deaths and Illness Rise in Bangladesh\n1988-09-10T05:00:00.000Z\nReports of illness and deaths from gastrointestinal diseases began to rise suddenly today, increasing fears of an epidemic even as the waters of this country's devastating flood continue to recede.\n''This year, we may surpass all records,'' Dr. Ziaul Islam, a medical officer in the Presidential Secretariat, said as he studied data coming in to the Government Health Information Center tonight.\nMillions of Bangladeshis are thought to be out of communication, marooned in villages or farmsteads built above water by a people experienced in the ways of rivers. Some relief groups say that even in normal times, only a small fraction of those afflicted by epidemic illnesses are ever recorded.\nNevertheless, the statistical jump today was dramatic. For the last few days, incidence of illness and deaths from gastrointestinal diseases remained fairly constant - 16,813 new illnesses and 4 people dead on Sept. 7; 16,827 newly ill and 6 dead on Sept. 8.\nToday, 21,412 people were reported sick and 13 died by early evening. Dr. Zia said the most frequent diseases were amoebic dysentery and gastroenteritis. Official Toll of 500 Dead\nBangladesh and relief agency officials fear that a rising incidence of disease will push up a death toll that initially was low. The official figure remained at about 500 today with much of the country still out of touch and unable to report.\nPast flooding, while not as extensive as this year's, has taken far larger tolls, particularly in the case of cyclones. This year, officials say, many people survived because they had time to reach higher ground.\nBangladesh is facing this rise in disease without adequate supplies of water purification tablets and medicines, officials say. But even if these were available, there is no way to deliver them to most affected areas.\nIn all of last year, Government health records reported 2,993,192 cases of serious gastrointestinal disease, with 4,720 deaths. Most of those occurred in September and October during another devastating flood.\n''Already this year there is a dangerous trend all over the country,'' Dr. Zia said. ''We are making all efforts to prevent an epidemic.''\nGrim forecasts by Government officials are worsened by the knowledge that only a few of the local authorities in Bangladesh have been able to report flood-related diseases.\nIn addition to amoebic dysentery and gastroenteritis, shigellosis, known here as ''blood dysentery,'' and cholera have been reported. Purification Tablets Needed\nDr. Zia and relief officials said the most pressing needs were for clean water or water purification tablets.\n''Our second line of defense is medicine and oral rehydration therapy,'' the doctor said. He added that most important was public education. Many villages now have contaminated wells and ground water, and people who can be reached - a minority now - will have to be persuaded to filter and boil all the water they consume.\nBangladesh continues to receive pledges of assistance from many foreign nations as it begins to assess flood damage and distribute relief supplies. U.S. OFFERING $150 MILLION\nWASHINGTON, Sept. 9 (Reuters) -The United States said today that it is prepared to give about $150 million to Bangladesh to help it recover from the flooding.\nThe Agency for International Development said it would contribute $4.6 million in direct disaster aid, $60 million in grain and $84 million for reconstruction."}, {"text": "IDEAS & TRENDS; Once More, the Earth Visits Disaster on the Plains of Bangladesh\n1988-09-11T05:00:00.000Z\nSPRAWLING across a vast delta where three of the world's great rivers meet, Bangladesh is the drainpipe of Central Asia. In bountiful times, the rich alluvial silt that covers most of the country yields as many as three rice crops a year. But when the drainpipe overflows, as it did two weeks ago, Bangladesh becomes a land reminiscent of Bruegel's visions of triumphant death.\nIn a 10-day period of torrential monsoon rain that ended last week, more than 22 inches fell in some regions, and rainfall throughout the country was twice as much as normal for such a period. When the rain finally let up, 50 of the country's 64 administrative districts lay under a sheet of water that covered roads to depths of up to eight feet.\nGovernments and relief organizations throughout the world hastened to send food and medicine, but as usual in such disasters, most of Bangladesh's 110 million inhabitants were isolated by the flood and beyond immediate help.\nHundreds died when the Brahmaputra, Ganges and Meghna Rivers overflowed. When the bacteria-laden water began to subside last week, germinating intestinal diseases lingered, tainting wells, rice paddies and streams. Water-borne illness is a principal cause of Bangladesh's 12 percent infant mortality rate.\nFor the people of long-suffering Bengal, disaster never seems to end. Though this year's floods were particularly destructive in the region, some flooding occurs nearly every year, shifting land, dispossessing farmers and spreading disease.\nSince the bloody birth of Bangladesh in 1971, some of the nation's leaders have blamed India, their one-time ally, for contributing to both floods and droughts. India and Bangladesh have often been at odds over the equitable division of water from the Brahmaputra, the Ganges and other rivers on which both countries depend. Bangladesh officials have accused India of disrupting the flow with its dams, and of worsening the silting problem by permitting extensive deforestation of regions drained by the rivers. Long, Slow Flooding\nThis year, although the overflowing of rivers originating in India, Nepal and Tibet apparently exacerbated matters, climatologists believe that the main cause of the disaster was rain in Bangladesh itself. Aside from the tea-growing hill country in the northeast, Bangladesh is as flat as a board and only a few feet above sea level. In hard rains, the shallow, sluggish rivers quickly overflow. Once inundated, the countryside takes weeks to drain.\nThe underlying problem is Bangladesh's yearly exposure to the southwest monsoon. As climatologists explain it, the monsoon affecting South Asia pivots around western China, where the sun warms the ground and the ground warms a rising column of air. This mass of rising air sucks in cooler air from the oceans, notably the Bay of Bengal, creating sea breezes in coastal areas.\nAs the moisture-filled air from the sea moves inland, it is warmed and pulled into the rising column. When the column reaches the cold air at high altitude, the moisture condenses. The rain is especially likely to begin over land that rises abruptly from a plain. This year, the rain was torrential where the Bangladesh highlands rise above the flat rice and jute fields.\nNo one knows why monsoon rains and the cyclonic storms that sometimes accompany them are destructive in some years and mild in others. But climatologists have a growing suspicion that ''active'' monsoons like the one Bangladesh has just been through are closely related to a phenomenon experts call the El Nino-Southern Oscillation.\nEvery few years, the surface water off the west coast of South America becomes warmer than usual, heating the air above it and disturbing circulation patterns in the atmosphere throughout the world. During a typical El Nino event, normally rainy regions are sometimes stricken by droughts, and normally parched areas are drenched. In 1982-83, the world experienced the most severe El Nino event on record, which damaged crops and fishing industries in regions as widely separated as New Zealand, California and Africa. Scientists believe it also perturbed carbon dioxide and ozone concentrations and may even have slightly slowed the Earth's rotation on its axis.\nOddly enough, however, the years when El Nino activity peaks seem to correspond to those in which the monsoon season in Bangladesh is mild, and vice versa. The most recent El Nino event ended last March, and some experts believe that this might have been taken as a sign that the monsoon in Bangladesh this summer would be severe.\nNo one yet knows what the connection between El Nino and the monsoon may be. Nor is anyone sure that being able to predict bad weather would really help Bangladesh much. The country's impoverished masses have nowhere to go, much as the many Bangladeshis who would like to emigrate to Pakistan or India. Flood control measures in a country that is mostly a big flood plain are limited.\n''At any rate,'' a public health official in Dhaka once said, ''the monsoon helps to assure our supply of the one commodity in which we are rich: misfortune.''"}, {"text": "Misery Rises With Rivers In Bangladesh\n1988-09-06T05:00:00.000Z\nWad-ing through waist-deep water late last week in the Muhammadpur residential district of the capital, Iqbal Ahmed, his few belongings on his shoulder, headed for the school on the Mirpur Road, which was still unaffected by the devastating floods.\nA few hours later, Mr. Ahmed, 45 years old, waded back 300 yards from the school to his home at the refugee camp where he was forced by the flood, to pick up his ill 5-year-old daughter.\nAt first he could not find her. Then, Mr. Ahmed, groping in the flooded shack where he lives with his family, discovered her lying dead in a pool of water into which she apparently fell in her sleep. There was some solace: at least Mr. Ahmed was able to bury his daughter, while bodies of many flood victims in Bangladesh are being put on makeshift rafts - there not being enough dry space for burial.\nEmaciated, unfed and without sleep for 24 hours, Mr. Ahmed mumbled: ''What will I do now? I'll go mad.''\nSuch poignant uncertainty seems to have gripped much of this country as flood waters cover the land, leaving at least 550 people dead and 25 million homeless. And the toll could go much higher, officials fear. One-third of Bangladesh is reported to still be under water.\n''The situation is beyond any description, any definition,'' Information Minister Mahbubur Rahman told reporters today.\nFlooding during the monsoon season is an annual event in this nation and is highly beneficial to agriculture. But the 1987 floods, which killed 1,600 people, were described as the worst in 70 years, and President H. M. Ershad has called this year's devastation ''far worse than last year's.''\nThe Brahmaputra and the Ganges, two of the major rivers in Bangladesh, a nation whose geography is delineated by rivers and deltas, had fallen since Sunday night, but the situation remained grave. Heavy rain fell again this afternoon, and the Dhaka weather bureau predicted that rain ''may continue intermittently, further swelling rivers already flowing above their danger levels.'' Prices Soar\nIn the capital, prices of such necessities as rice, cooking oil, salt and kerosene shot up anywhere from 30 percent to 200 percent. Kerosene to light lamps was in the shortest supply, with electricity cut off in most areas.\nMr. Rahman, the Information Minister, said today that 21 million homes had been washed away and that more than 30 million of the country's 110 million people were directly affected. He added that the actual losses will be known only after the water recedes.\nMr. Rahman said three more districts have been flooded, raising the number affected to 50 out of 64 districts in the country.\nCommunications in most areas affected remained disrupted or nonexistent, making it all but impossible to obtain food, medicine and other relief goods. Lack of pure drinking water is reported to have caused an outbreak of diarrhea and other stomach ailments. A senior Health Ministry official, Taslim Ahmed, said the number of people suffering from dysentery is also rising. The Matter of Starvation\nAlthough the Government denied that anyone had yet died of starvation, witnesses said a man died today at a relief center in the Kishalaya school, in the Zigatala district of the capital.\nOfficials said the United States, Britain, Japan, Australia, Canada, India, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia have responded to the Government's appeal for help.\nThe devastation has forced the authorities to abandon their efforts to rescue an estimated two million people marooned in remote areas. They are inaccessible because of the lack of small boats.\nRoad and rail communication in the flooded areas collapsed 10 days ago.\nIn some districts like Faridpur, Madaripur and Sariatpur in the south, helicopters carrying relief supplies cannot land for lack of dry space.\nRelief Ministry officials acknowledged that their efforts are being severely hampered. ''We have food in our stock,'' President Ershad said, ''but the question is how to deliver it.'' It has similarly become all but impossible for the authorities to accurately assess the extent of damage and the loss of life.\nAerial photos showed village after village leveled by flood waters. Panic in Capital\nIn Dhaka itself, where flooding is unusual, a panic seemed to have spread among the estimated two million out of five million city dwellers affected.\nMen, women and children by the thousands - with a few essentials on their heads and babies tightly held to mothers' breasts - are wading through water in search of shelter. Older people unable to walk are being piggybacked.\nThey are mostly the poor; others who are better off, were seen escaping by boats and rafts that now ply most of the streets of Dhaka.\nThe powerful are not immune. The state television network has showed pictures of President Ershad's official residence under knee-deep water. Airport Also Flooded\nDhaka, severed a week ago by road and rail link from the rest of Bangladesh, is cut off from the outside world, as well. The international airport was closed on Friday, its runway flooded.\nAll schools have been shut down in the affected areas, and inmates of hospitals and prisons evacuted.\nGas for cooking is in critically short supply, and the wells, now under water, have become contaminated with sewage.\nFor some, though, the picture is not altogether bleak. Boatmen are doing a brisk business. And some children, too young to fathom the magnitude of the disaster, are enthusiastic. They can be seen splashing and frolicking in the water."}, {"text": "CYCLONE BATTERS BANGLADESH COAST\n1988-12-01T05:00:00.000Z\nA cyclone battered coastal areas of Bangladesh and eastern India late Tuesday, killing at least 300 people and leaving a trail of devastation, officials and news reports said today.\nOfficials said the death toll was likely to rise dramatically as recovery efforts progressed and communications in the affected areas were fully restored.\nOfficials told the United News of India that more than 870 people, including 500 fishermen, had been killed. Other Bangladeshi officials said they feared the death toll would be in the thousands. Hundreds of thousands of people were reportedly left homeless and millions of tons of crops were said to have been destroyed. Winds to 120 Miles Per Hour\nThe cyclone struck Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries, as it was continuing its recovery from the worst flooding in its history; the flooding in August and September covered three-fourths of the country and caused damages now estimated at more than $1 billion.\nThe storm, with winds of 60 to 120 miles per hour, whipped 10-foot-high tidal waves as it swept across the Bay of Bengal and through the southern and southeastern districts of Khulna, Satkhira, Bagerhat, Byrguna, Barisal, Patuakhali, Bhola, Chittagong and the town of Cox's Bazar. Electrical power and communications in those areas were cut off.\nAt least 275 fishermen were reported missing, and officials said they expected many more deaths as reports come in from the hundreds of tiny islands in the Bay of Bengal.\nA relief ministry official said that about 80 percent of the crops and mud and thatch homes in the two hardest-hit districts, Khulna and Satkhira, had been destroyed. Warnings Were Broadcast\nBut he said that human casualties had been minimized by an efficient early warning system that helped people evacuate vulnerable areas. This official predicted the final death toll would be no more than ''a few thousand.''\nGiven the record of previous cyclones in Bangladesh - the most recent in 1985, which killed an estimated 10,000 people - that prediction seemed to a remarkably low figure. More than 300,000 people died in 1970 in the worst cyclone in Bangladesh's history."}, {"text": "Death Toll at 500 in Bangladesh Cyclone\n1988-12-02T05:00:00.000Z\nThe official death toll rose to more than 500 today after a cyclone struck a wide area of southern Bangladesh, and the authorities continued the search for thousands of people still missing.\nThe cyclone hit Bangladesh's coast Tuesday, causing flooding that left at least 300,000 people homeless, caused extensive crop damage and cut electricity and telephone service to large areas in the south.\nBangladesh television reported tonight that more than 350 people had been killed in the Khulna area.\nOfficials were especially concerned about casualties in Dublarchar Island in the Bay of Bengal, about 300 miles southwest of Dhaka, where it is estimated that 1,000 people, mostly fishermen, may have been carried away by a tidal surge. A naval ship sent to the area has so far recovered 102 bodies."}, {"text": "Death Toll in India After Heavy Floods Is Reported at 1,000\n1988-10-03T05:00:00.000Z\nThe death toll from floods that have submerged many areas in India's northwest was nearing 1,000 today, according to reports from the region. Hundreds of thousands of residents in four states have been evacuated to higher ground.\nMost severely affected in more than a week of flooding has been Punjab State, where many acres of farmland have been inundated. A state government spokesman in Chandigarh said Saturday that at least 400 people had died in the state in nearly 9,000 affected villages and towns.\nLocal news organizations put the number of deaths in Punjab at about 600, with some areas still cut off and unable to report casualties. The districts of Ferozepore, Jullundur and Amritsar were among those hardest hit. Food Stocks Are Gone\nTens of thousands of farm animals have perished. Food stocks have been destroyed, prompting the Government to begin dropping relief supplies by air. [ A boat evacuating people from floodwaters in Pakistan's Punjab Province capsized and 35 people aboard were feared drowned, Reuters reported. It quoted the state-run Radio Pakistan as saying seven bodies had been recovered after the incident near Faisalabad. ] The states of Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir have reported hundreds more casualties as rivers swollen by record monsoon rains have poured into the fertile plains and valleys of the northwest. In Rajasthan, officials said they were on the alert for rising water in rivers and canals that pass through Punjab. Flooding Near the Capital\nThe Jumna River, which runs along the eastern edge of the capital, has also overflowed, disrupting the lives of many poor Indians who erect makeshift homes on its wide banks. But apart from the flooding of some city roads, the functioning of the capital has not been badly affected.\nToday, flood waters were reported to be receding in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. But the rivers are still high in Punjab, a politically sensitive state where four years of violence has already damaged the economy.\nThis weekend, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi named a Cabinet committee to open talks with the legal political opposition in the state, which Mr. Gandhi visited on Sept. 21. The talks, announced before the floods, are intended to consider solutions for the state's political and economic deterioration.\nViolence, which has claimed at least 2,000 lives this year, began with a call for a separate homeland by Sikh militants, followed by an armed response by New Delhi. Terrorism is now no longer confined to the Sikh dispute, but has spread into general lawlessness, Punjabis say. Robberies and attacks occur daily.\nDeforestation in the Himalayas and their foothills is easing the rush of water into India's northern states, experts say. The barren, eroded hills along the mountainous roof of India and nearby Nepal are also thought to have contributed to recent heavy flooding in northeastern India and in Bangladesh, where several large river systems enter the Bay of Bengal. Cooperation With Bangladesh\nBangladesh has been seeking international support in studying the river systems and making recommendations for joint projects to control the waters. Bangladesh's President, Lieut. Gen. H. M. Ershad, visited India on Thursday to raise his concerns with Prime Minister Gandhi.\nThe Indians told General Ershad that New Delhi wanted to keep the discussions confined to an Indian-Bangladesh commission, and not involve other nations at this point. India, where politicians are sensitive to what they see as infringements on national sovereignty, has long resisted the ''internationalization'' of the rivers issue.\nIndia has proposed building a canal across Bangladeshi territory to link the Brahmaputra and Ganges systems to drain water from the former into the latter.\nIn Bangladesh, where the idea of an ''Indian'' canal has never been popular, a sense of desperation is growing, spurred by this year's devastating floods. The floods submerged nearly three-quarters of the country and left millions homeless.\nGeneral Ershad plans to go ahead with his plans to visit Nepal, Bhutan and China to discuss possible projects for managing the Himalayan rivers.\nHe is scheduled to go to Katmandu on Monday, less than a week after Indian officials made it clear that they did not want to involve Nepal in talks."}, {"text": "In Bangladesh, Too Much Water and Not Enough\n1988-09-18T05:00:00.000Z\nWith two jerrycans in hand, Muklesha Khatun waited impatiently for about four hours for the water trucks to arrive, and finally took home her allotted daily quota, two gallons.\n''I have to make do with these two pots for my entire family of five,'' Mrs. Khatun said, ''but in a way I'm thankful to Allah that we're still getting it.''\nMrs. Khatun, 45 years old, is one of about 30,000 residents of the overcrowded, low-lying neighborhood of Mugdapara here in the capital who have been at the mercy of such erratic water deliveries since Bangladesh was inundated with widespread flooding late last month. It is estimated that at least a third of the capital's five million people have been without regular water supplies because of the flooding.\nWith reservoir tanks and pumping stations submerged in many areas, hundreds of thousands of people are now dependent on drinking water brought from outside. The water and sewerage authority and political and volunteer organizations have mounted a major operation to bring drinking water to the affected areas, but, as Mrs. Khatun's experience shows, their efforts sometimes fall short.\nMuch of the country is still under water. The Government says that 935 people have died in the flooding, but its count is generally considered too low, and Dhaka newspapers put the toll at more than 1,800. The Health Ministry says that about 220,000 people are suffering from gastrointestinal diseases like diarrhea and dysentery as a result of the flooding, and that 185 people have died from such diseases. [ Railroad service from Dhaka to Chittagong, the main port, and Sylhet, the business center, has been restored after repairs to a railroad bridge outside the capital, Reuters reported. The bridge was washed away two weeks ago in the flooding. ] Getting water to Mugdapara, Mrs. Khatun's neighborhood, is an arduous and time-consuming exercise.\nVolunteers of the Family Planning Association of Bangladesh must first negotiate by rickshaw through waterlogged roads to reach the municipal pumping station, where their drums are filled. The drums are taken by pickup truck for a distance, but transferred again to rickshaws for delivery through streets where the water is still too deep. A stretch of mud has to be covered by men who carry the drums on their heads. Finally, when the drums reach the neighborhood, they are loaded onto boats that set off down serpentine lanes and bylanes to the community center, where the family planning association has set up its distribution camp.\n''It's a killing job,'' said Kazi Anisur Rahman, secretary general of the association. ''We spend nearly two hours to deliver five drums to this area less than three miles from our headquarters.'' Land for Dead and Living\nThe wan smile never left Nuruddin Mia's face as he wearily maneuvered his boat past submerged trees and houses under a blazing sun, on his way to Paschimgaon, a village of about 5,000 people 12 miles southwest of Dhaka.\nFor 30 years, Mr. Mia, who is from the village, has been ferrying people to and from the village of Demraghat three miles away. His route is the Balu River, which in the flooding has become a huge lake stretching as far as the eye can see.\n''Never, ever have I heard or seen such a flood and horror in my life,'' said Mr. Mia, who is 46. ''There's not a single house in this area that has escaped its wrath.''\nHis own house has been inundated by waist-deep water and looks as if it might crumble at any moment.\nMr. Mia and his 18-year-old son, Sohrab Hossain, spend nights in the boat. The other five members of his family sleep on the tin roof of the house, exposed to the elements. ''My own nephew, born 20 days ago, died of cold, and there is no doctor here who could be consulted with,'' he said.\nHe said the family had a hard time finding a dry spot where the body could be buried. ''Ultimately we took him to an adjoining area where a small parcel of land was found and we buried him there,'' he said.\nThe parcel holding the burial site is also haven for at least 200 people, mostly women and children huddling together with cattle, ducks and chickens.\n''This flood has leveled everybody -rich and poor, high and low,'' said Janab Ali Matbar, 65, the village headman. 'Living Like Animals'\nIn another neighborhood, 30 minutes ride by boat, an incomplete two-story rural health center converted into a relief camp houses more than 300 men, women and children. Of the four toilets in the building, two in the ground floor are under water, so many of those taking refuge in the building relieve themselves in the surrounding flood water. Many people were seen bathing and washing in the contaminated water.\n''You can't really call it life,'' said Rafiqul Islam Khandker, 40, who is in charge of the camp and who is also the headmaster of the local high school. ''They're living like animals.'' Still, many of those in the center appeared grateful to have found a place where one meal is provided daily, since they are extremely poor even in their normal circumstances.\nMr. Khandker said that there have been surprisingly few cases of diarrhea, dysentery and flu, diseases normally inevitable in such conditions.\n''There's no death yet due to these diseases,'' Mr. Khandker said.\nAzimul Baki, a rural health assistant, interjected: ''If there is any, we simply have to put the dead on a makeshift raft for lack of dry space for burial.''"}, {"text": "High Ground Is a Stranger In Bangladesh\n1988-09-07T05:00:00.000Z\nBangladesh is a nation seemingly founded on unstable footing.\nIts very ground is, by and large, a swarm of islands created and washed away each year as the waggling, monsoon-swollen Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers reach across its vast delta and tumble into the Bay of Bengal.\nIts politics are no more predictable. Two presidents have been assassinated in its 17-year history, and Bangladesh has suffered waves of man-made terror. Terrible natural disasters are too frequent in this nation of 55,126 square miles, about the size of Wisconsin, which is bordered by India and Burma at the bend in the Bay of Bengal.\nThe majority of its population of more than 100 million is crammed onto the islands, most no more than 10 feet above sea level, that speckle the delta. When disaster strikes, there is no high ground upon which to seek refuge. Tidal Waves and Heavy Rains\nIn 1970, a tidal wave killed 300,000 people. In June 1976, heavy rains swept away the homes of 300,000 people and killed at least 143. In April 1977, waves created by a cyclone in the Indian Ocean killed 600 people. In 1980, flooding forced the evacuation of 500,000 people. In 1985, a cyclone killed at least 1,400 and perhaps as many as 10,000.\nAinslie Embree, a South Asia specialist at Columbia University, said, ''Man-made disasters are just as consequent as the natural disasters.''\nEver since the 12th century, when Moslem invaders brought Islam to Bengal, which encompasses Bangladesh and eastern India, there has been religious strife with Hindus. Most Bangladeshis are Moslem, with Hindus making up 14 percent of the population. The Moslem rulers were forced out by the British in the 18th century.\nIn 1947, predominantly Hindu India won independence from Britain and a separate Moslem state, Pakistan, was created in two parts, divided by 1,000 miles of Indian territory. The partition evoked ages-old religious enmity, and massacres ensued. Power Centered in West\nPower in the new Moslem nation was centered in West Pakistan, and by 1968, rioters in the more populous East were demanding autonomy. By 1970, separatists from the East had won a majority in the National Assembly and were pressing for more power. But Assembly sessions were postponed by Agha Yahya Khan, then President, and full-scale civil war erupted. ''Bangladesh suffered greatly during the civil war,'' Dr. Embree said. ''A great many of the intellectuals were killed.''\nDr. Embree said the Pakistani Army killed 100,000 Bangladeshis. With Indian troops invading in support of the separatists, independence was won in December 1971. Then, thousands of Pakistani collaborators were slaughtered.\nOne of the nation's continuing tragedies is the presence on its soil of more than a million people from Bihar State in India. These people, who do not speak Bengali, have remained in refugee camps since independence. ''They want to go to Pakistan, but the Pakistanis won't take them,'' Dr. Embree said. ''They are among the more miserable refugees in the world.'' Demonstrations in November\n''While these people are Moslems, they are regarded as foreigners because they don't speak Bengali,'' he said. ''They also supported the Pakistan Government, and so they are regarded as traitors.''\nAfter the nation gained independence, much of its Hindu population fled to India. ''India claims there were 10 million of them,'' Dr. Embree said.\nSince independence, two presidents have been assassinated, the founder of the nation, Mujibur Rahman, in 1975, and Ziaur Rahman, in 1981.\nLast November, there were major demonstrations against the Government of President H. M. Ershad, who took power in a military coup in March 1982. General Ershad ended martial law in 1986, retired from the army and successfully ran for election.\n''The riots in November just about disrupted the economy completely,'' said Craig Baxter, a professor of South Asian history at Juniata College in Huntingdon, Pa. ''There were strikes, transportation breakdowns, a failure to fulfill international contracts.'' Two Opposition Leaders\nThe demonstrations were led by two principal opposition leaders, Sheik Hasina, the daughter of Mujibur Rahman, and Begum Khaleda Zia, the widow of Ziaur Rahman. President Ershad was re-elected this year after a campaign in which the opposition leaders refused to take part, saying the elections could not be fair.\nAs it has been since its birth, Bangladesh remains one of the poorest countries in the world, primarily because its economy is based on agriculture. ''Most people live at an agricultural subsistence level,'' Dr. Embree said.\n''Very little industry has been developed,'' he continued, ''and they have very few exports.'' Jute, which is used to make rope and burlap, is Bangladesh's main export. ''But the world market for jute disappeared in recent years because of plastics and man-made fibers,'' Dr. Embree said.\nOf necessity, the people have developed a remarkable style of life, trying to adapt to the water that annually sweeps through the country with the monsoon. Many Bangladeshis live in homes built on earthen platforms of four yards or higher and sow varieties of rice that will grow in deep water."}, {"text": "Groups Taking Aid Donations\n1988-09-07T05:00:00.000Z\nAmerican Jewish World Service, 729 Boylson Street, Boston, Mass. 02116.

An Annual Event\nThe overall flood situation in this south Asian nation remained basically unchanged, though the levels of most rivers had dropped further after the devastation wrought by the monsoon, the wind-driven torrential rain that occurs annually in this part of the world. The monsoon is both devastating and beneficial: the death and destruction it brings is repetitive, yet agriculture -and particularly rice cultivation - depends on it.\nDuring a two-hour helicopter trip to and from Bhola today, vast sheets of water stretched as far as the eye could see.\nIn the affected districts - Narayangang, Munshigang, Faridpur and Chandpur - the treetops and tin roofs still protruded above water. Some communities, and the district headquarters of Narayangang and Munshigang, 11 and 20 miles south of Dhaka respectively, measured the flooding at knee-deep levels. Boats were seen plying the roads along with rickshaws. Many Are Cut Offs\nA helicopter pilot, flying over vast areas during the last few days, said he has seen many people trapped by flood waters asking for food.\nInformation Minister Mahbubur Rahman said that about 1,700 relief centers were in operation throughout the country. On one such place in Narayangang hung a sign reading ''Ershad Gruel Kitchen.''\nIn Nichkasia, Mr. Haq and about 200 other flood victims rushed toward three journalists today, having mistaken them for relief officials.\n''They don't care about us,'' said Mohammad Musa, 60 years old. ''They show up only when such great disasters befall us.''\nNaziur Rahman Mia, Minister of State for Local Government and Rural Development, said that more than 200,000 of of the district's 1.4 million people had been affected by the flooding and that about 70,000 had lost everything they owned.\n''Now the main problem is erosion of the river,'' said Mr. Mia, who is from this district. ''Already, 22 square miles have been gobbled up by the Meghna, leaving thousands homeless.''\nHe said he would assess the damage and provide relief as it is needed.

It took about half an hour to travel those five miles by jeep.\nHealth officials throughout the country continued to express concern both over hunger of flood victims and disease in places where there is little or no pure drinking water.\nA daily newspaper, Ittefaq, reported large-scale outbreaks of diarrhea and other intestinal ailments.

Intensity Is Normal\nDespite Bangladesh's enormous needs, activity these days is said to be only somewhat more intense than usual.\n''We're working 16 disasters right now,'' Julia V. Taft, the harried but unfailingly courteous dynamo who has run the O.F.D.A. since early 1986, said on Thursday as she prepared for the 3 P.M. Bangladesh strategy session. ''We are just busting ourselves.''\nSince Sept. 1, when Bangladesh was officially declared a disaster - a life-threatening situation beyond the ability of the victims' government to handle - five other disasters have been added to the O.F.D.A.'s list. These little publicized tragedies, bringing the total to a record-tying 54 for the office this year, involve floods in the Dominican Republic, insect infestation in Ethiopia, floods in Niger, displaced people in Burundi and floods in India.\nThe job of Mrs. Taft and her staff, which includes some former members of the Peace Corps, is to identify, with the help of A.I.D. missions and American embassies, the need for help and to coordinate the Federal Government's response. This generally also involves liaison with private voluntary organizations like CARE and the Save the Children Fund that have a a permanent presence in stricken countries. 'The Focal Point'\n''They're the focal point,'' said Robert J. McCloskey, a former State Department official and Ambassador who is now Washington representative for Catholic Relief Services, which has contributed $300,000 so far through its Caritas Bangladesh affiliate.\nJoy Carol, director of Save the Children's Asia-Pacific region, said that even when her group acts on its own, perhaps before the Government can mount an airlift, ''we always report immediately'' to the State Department office as to what has been done.\nThe office also keeps track of what other countries and international organizations are doing. Saudi Arabia and India, for example, were listed on a situation report last week as having lent four helicopters each to the Bangladesh relief effort, and Japan was shown as pledging $13 million for food and transportation.\nMrs. Taft seems a master at marshaling the vast Government resources at her disposal. She is a veteran relief worker; in the 1970's she was director of the Interagency Task Force for Indochina Refugees based in the State Department, and has also worked in this field at the Pentagon. In addition to the Defense Department, the office has close ties with the Centers for Disease Control, the Forest Service and its A.I.D. sister unit, the Bureau for Food for Peace. Response on Same Day\nThe Government's first cash donation to this year's victims of monsoon rains and subsequent flooding came the same day that Bangladesh's President, H.M. Ershad, made his international appeal for help. Willard A. DePree, the United States Ambassador in Dhaka, exercising his disaster-assistance authority, released $25,000 for the President's emergency fund. The O.F.D.A. quickly added a $40,000 grant to Save the Children, $50,000 to CARE, $132,000 to World Vision and $1.1 million to two arms of the United Nations. In addition, Food for Peace released 10,000 tons of ''food-for-work'' program wheat from Bangladesh stocks, the grain and transport for it valued at about $2.5 million.\nMeanwhile, Mrs. Taft and her staff had begun planning for the first shipments of goods to Bangladesh, on a giant Air Force C-5A crammed with supplies drawn mainly from a depot at New Windsor, Md., one of the O.F.D.A.'s six stockpiles. The others are in Panama, Guam, Singapore, and Pisa, Italy. There is also a cache of survival kits and communications equipment at headquarters.\nThis cargo plane, loaded at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware and Andrews Air Force Base in suburban Washington, left Friday night and arrived, with the aid of midair refuelings, in Bangladesh today after a layover in Japan. The airport in Dhaka was reopened only late last week.\nIn the shipment were 850 rolls, or 2.2 million square feet, of plastic sheeting for shelter; 10,000 collapsible five-gallon water jugs; 26 water storage tanks, each with a 3,000-gallon capacity, and two water purifier systems, each with an operator to run it and to train Bangladeshis in its use. A Three-Week Stay\nA dozen other Americans from various agencies were on the plane, including Jay F. Morris, the Deputy Administrator of A.I.D. All but Mr. Morris are to remain in Bangladesh least three weeks.\n''The marching orders are to do everything we can,'' Mrs. Taft said.\nLater this week, a second plane, a C-141, will leave Panama with more American equipment for Bangladesh, including six large fiberglass boats with 40-horsepower engines, 150 large tents and 10,000 blankets. Some equipment will be picked up en route at a Defense Department depot on Okinawa.\nThe O.F.D.A. flights generally do not carry privately donated goods, which on some occasions, including the 1985 Mexican earthquake, have proven more a hindrance than a help.\n''Some people clean out their closets with lots of junk, and the important stuff doesn't get through,'' said Mrs. Taft.\nAlthough the O.F.D.A. has more financial latitude than most agencies - Congress is a good bet to approve a compelling special request even in the budget-conscious era - it has resources, including borrowings from A.I.D. accounts, other than budgetary appropriations. For example, Mr. Morris and his staff will seek to ''reprogram'' some $84 million built up in Bangladeshi currency under a program by which American food is given to that country for local sale. Tries to Avoid Politics\nThe disaster office, which in the 1987 fiscal year administered $25.7 million in emergency assistance involving 54 situations, spent another $4.1 million for various programs to mitigate hazards, to improve warning systems and otherwise to prepare for disruptions.\nIn 1986, because of the famine in Ethiopia, the office presided over a record-shattering $130 million in aid.\nMrs. Taft, although appointed to her post by the President, is careful to keep her office free from both international politics - the United States need not have diplomatic relations with a country to offer aid -and domestic partisanship. The latter, however, doesn't prevent her on occasion from discussing things with her husband, William Howard Taft 4th, a deputy Secretary of Defense and a prominent member of the Administration.\nThe department, she says, has traditionally paid ''special attention'' to the needs of the disaster office, but she on occasion plays the spouse card as well to obtain transportation and other support. ''I think it may help -a little bit,'' Mrs. Taft said."}, {"text": "Water Recedes, Spirits Rise in Dhaka\n1988-09-08T05:00:00.000Z\nThe sun was shining in Dhaka today, the water was receding, and for a moment at least, there was a more hopeful air in city neighborhoods.\nIn a few weeks, perhaps even a few days, it may not be so. Welfare agencies fear that the lowering tide from the devastating floods will leave epidemic diseases in the slate-gray mud.\nBut today, shops were open in the city center, which escaped the flooding. The international airport, an island of sorts on a waterlogged plain, began to function again after the annual monsoon rains left much of the nation under water and millions homeless.\nOfficials said today that the death toll from the floods had risen to more than 800. They said at least 150 people had died in less than 24 hours, most of those from diarrhea and dysentery caused by impure water and rotten food. The central Government's announced death toll is slightly more than half that, but is widely considered far too low. Unofficial tabulations in Dhaka newspapers run to more than 1,200, and communications with many outlying areas are still out.\nBicycle rickshaw pullers were doing a brisk business along roads where drivers feared to take their cars, areas that are still under water. Spirit of the Marketplace\nSubmerged streets were full of indefatigable entrepreneurs - fellows who will push your car for anything you can spare, children standing in water for a pittance to show a driver how deep it is, a pushcart vendor-turned-boatman who grinned with embarrassment each time he beached his leaky vessel on a curb or an unseen bush.\nBoats themselves are a new business. Tiny skiffs that once cost less than $20 are being hustled in the wetter neighborhoods for as much as $50, a huge amount of money for the very poor.\nSome families have no choice but to buy one anyway. A boat takes marooned people to the markets for food. It allows them to live at home - albeit often on their traditional flat rooftops, from which they can keep looters away. A boat also saves slogging barefoot through waters polluted with sewage and infested with snakes.\nThe better-off residents of Dhaka concede that, this time, it is to some extent a ''middle-class flood.'' The people of Bangladesh, most rural and poor, are used to the annual inundation of their land and homes. Indians Are Blamed\nThe flooding is worse this year because south Asia in general, and India in particular, have had a record monsoon rain. Hundreds of people have also died in eastern India.\nA commonly heard explanation here is that ''the water comes from India.''\nEvery year there is concern about India's deforested hills and mountains and its uncompleted flood-control programs, which allow flood waters to tumble through Bangladesh on their way to the sea. This year, the complaint is heard more often because the water has washed into the capital.\nDhaka is a city that can empty its streets quickly in a crisis. Political tension seems to be a recurrent part of life here, since the days when Bangladesh was the eastern region of Pakistan.\nToday, however, there was no such anxiety but , if anything, a sense of making the best of a terrible situation.\n''Pani, pani,'' a man said with a rueful smile, shaking his head and using the Bengali word for water, as he hoisted a parcel wrapped in a bandanna into the air. Then he plunged in up to his neck on the way home from shopping.\nBangladeshis, the majority of whom are Moslems, have been augmenting official relief efforts with their own makeshift projects.\nTonight, as dusk fell on a sodden community in south Dhaka, a group of energetic young men arrived with two barrels of clean, fresh drinking water, which they began to distribute in a school and along a muddy highway median.\nOne of them, Nakim Mahmud Narullah, a law student at Dhaka University, said he and his three colleagues were volunteers for the Islamic Dawa Complex, a charitable organization. Islam ranks welfare high among the obligations of its adherents.\nAsked why he and his friends were standing there in their immaculate clothes, giving drinks and water-purification tablets to the children of beggars, he replied:\n''We are Moslems. It is our duty.''"}, {"text": "In Disasters, a U.N. Agency Produces Order\n1988-10-23T05:00:00.000Z\nWhen hurricane Gilbert struck Jamaica last month, knocking out communications on the island, amateur radio operators were organized to carry information on the extent of damage. In Bangladesh, when the country was hit last month by the worst floods in memory, there were large stocks of food on hand to face the immediate crisis. Before the rains came to Sudan last August, causing widespread destruction, plans had been prepared for coping with floods.\nWhen natural disasters strike and even before, countries turn to the office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator for help. The organization, which is based in Geneva, has mobilized aid for typhoons, earthquakes, tropical storms, floods, volcanic eruptions, drought and famine around the world.\n''We're monitoring every disaster -not to deliver relief but information,'' said Philippe Boulle, director of the organization's New York office. The organization also coordinates aid from the international community, other United Nations agencies and humanitarian groups active in disaster work.\nThough the number and scope of emergency situations calling for international attention have increased in recent years, Mr. Boulle stressed that loss of life is ''much lower than a decade ago because of prevention.''\nThis week the General Assembly recalled its resolution designating the 1990's the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction and voted by consensus in favor of emergency assistance for Jamaica and the Sudan and aid for disaster prevention programs for Bangladesh.\nThe Disaster Relief Coordinator, along with other agencies in the United Nations system, was asked to assist the Government of Bangladesh in preparing a feasibility plan for a permanent solution to the recurring problem of floods and droughts.\nSet up in 1971, the agency was designed to coordinate and strengthen relief efforts for major disasters. It tried to tackle too much, from building bridges to helping dislocated people in Africa and was blamed for not dealing adequately with long-term emergencies like the situation in Ethiopia.\nIn the last three years, the agency's focus has shifted to sudden emergencies, information and guidance, according to Mr. Boulle.\nIn 1986-87, the agency responded to 110 disasters, including cyclones and floods in Bangladesh, an earthquake in El Salvador, drought in Ethiopia, armed conflict and floods in Lebanon, and a typhoon in Vietnam.\nOver the last two years, however, the agency has focussed increasingly on disaster preparedness and prevention, with an increasing number of requests from developing countries to strengthen their national and regional emergency services. Dwindling Emergency Fund\nMore than 30 disaster mitigation projects have been developed, such as the Seismic Risk Reduction Project in the Balkans, the Pan-Caribbean Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Project in Antigua, the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center in Bangkok and a similar center for South Pacific being set up in Fiji.\nDisasters are generally defined as emergencies with at least 10 reported killed or property damage in excess of $1 million. But Mr. Boulle, who comes from the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, stressed that the agency was concerned not just with the dimensions of a disaster, but above all ''the dimensions of the internal need.''\nEmphasizing his agency's dependence on others, Mr. Boulle cited Italy, Canada, the Netherlands, Britain and Australia as among the most generous donors. He said the United States, Japan, Soviet Union and Belgium ''could do more.''\n''What we're really lacking is an adequate emergency fund,'' the he said, adding the agency had given ''the ridiculous sum of $30,000'' to help Bangladesh during the floods. He noted that current budget restraints had reduced the fund for emergency cash grants from $360,000 to $180,00 a year, and the agency had been able to respond positively to only half of the 32 requests in 1986-87."}, {"text": "Quotation of the Day\n1988-09-07T05:00:00.000Z\n''Bangladesh is one vast swamp and what you're confronted with is rebuilding a country.

Who knows how many victims in floods of the Sudan and Bangladesh? Natural disasters of this kind have killed nearly three million people in the last 20 years and caused incalculable suffering and untold damage.\nThe news brings us a series of shocks: Hurricane Gilbert, toll as yet unknown; the earthquake in Nepal, maybe a thousand dead. Who knows how many victims in floods of the Sudan and Bangladesh? Natural disasters of this kind have killed nearly three million people in the last 20 years and caused incalculable suffering and untold damage. They've probably killed more people than the wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan or Iran and Iraq combined.\nAnd yet, many of these lives could have been saved through the use of the latest communications technology. Too often, it is either unavailable or just not applied.\nCommunication is essential not only for coordinating relief efforts and issuing warnings but also in preparing for calamities. Following a flood or earthquake, for example, relief agencies often operate in the dark, with no accurate idea of the terrain before the event, the nature and extent of the disaster, what help is needed and how to get it there. In countries with weak communications infrastructures, relief workers have no way of warning people of further problems, such as disease and pollution, and where they can get help.\nWith a little planning and common sense, much of the information gap could be closed. For instance, both the United States and the Soviet Union have deployed enormously costly satellite remote-imaging systems that could provide highly detailed maps of disaster areas before and after the catastrophe. These images would be far quicker and better than the pictures we are beginning to get from commercial imaging satellites, which are not usually available in time to be of much help.\nThe difficulty is that these intelligence systems are secret - so secret that even the discussion of how they might be useful is inhibited by the cloak of national security. Surely, the superpowers could figure out how to make data from their systems regularly available without compromising national security.\nThe media could make their contribution. Sometimes television companies deploy a communications ability far beyond what relief agencies can afford. In that case, prior agreement on the sharing of underused capacity ought to be routine.\nBut institutional and political problems get in the way. For instance, there is no international agreement expediting the free movement of emergency communications equipment across borders. A new international convention is needed to remove these administrative barriers.\nDespite tragic experience, there is still no recognized international clearinghouse of contacts, information and action in case of sudden disaster. There is no central data bank of available relief resources or maps of the world's terrain. Existing international agencies lack the assets and clout to coordinate effectively. And sometimes they don't really understand the new technology.\nRelief agencies need to know what the latest in communications can do for them, and satellite specialists need a real-world understanding of relief work on the ground. Much of the technology already exists and just needs to be adapted to additional tasks at reasonable cost. For example, there are sensors that can give early warning of impending disasters and small satellite earth stations that can be flown in during an emergency to re-establish national and international communication where local telephone systems have been destroyed.\nStill, little changes. Some of the barriers to action are political and some are just institutional drag. Some arise from a lack of understanding. Either way, the sad truth is that thousands of people will die in the next years, or even days, because we can't get organized to do all that we can to save them."}, {"text": "NEWS SUMMARY\n1988-09-07T05:00:00.000Z\nINTERNATIONAL A3-16 Pledges of assistance to Bangladesh have amounted to millions of dollars in money and other assistance, Bangladeshi and international aid officials said.

Canada\n1. Relations between the United States and Canada came under increasing strain this year because of acid rain. Scientists say that sulfur dioxide from industries in the United States continues to kill aquatic life in hundreds of lakes in the Adirondack Mountains and in other parts of the Northeast and Canada. United States\n2. Four decades of nuclear weapon production has polluted the air, soil and water at 16 plants and research laboratories in the United States. The contaminants include uranium, plutonium, cesium, strontium, PCB's, chromium, arsenic, mercury and solvents used in making nuclear weapons. Carcinogens leaking into an underground water reservoir from the Rocky Flats Plant north of Denver was ranked as the worst problem. Mexico City\n3. Air pollution is so bad in the Mexico City area, where 20 million people live, that all schools will be closed next month so that children can stay indoors and reduce their exposure. Winter temperature inversions trap ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, lead, mercury and other pollutants, most of them generated by the city's three million cars, trucks and buses. The result is a rise in respiratory problems, fatigue, nausea and headaches. Brazil\n4. Fires used to clear land for agriculture and ranching in the Amazon destroyed 30,000 square miles of virgin forest last year, an area the size of Maine. The burning is so extensive that it may account for one-tenth of the global man-made production of carbon dioxide, one of the gases believed to cause the greenhouse effect. Millions of tons of methane and nitrogen oxides generated each year by the fires may help erode the earth's protective ozone shield. Adriatic Sea\n5. This summer the Adriatic, like many other parts of the world, suffered an outbreak of algae. Fed by phosphates and other pollutants, the algae starved the water of oxygen, killing fish in a 1,000-mile stretch along the Italian coast. Bangladesh\n6. Tree cutting, overgrazing and agricultural erosion in the Himalayan watershed make Bangladesh's monsoons increasingly disastrous. In August mountain runoff helped swell the Ganges River, flooding the country and killing 1,200 people. Africa\n7. Drought and erosion from farming, grazing and wood gathering are helping the Sahara to advance as much as 3 1/2 miles a year into the sub-Saharan region of northwestern Africa. Erosion is also bad in the Ethiopian highlands, the headwaters of the Blue Nile, where a burgeoning population is stripping the hillsides bare. Environmentalists say that the destruction of the watershed considerably worsened a flood last summer in the Sudan that left at least 1.5. million people homeless. Antarctic Ozone Hole\n8. Last December the Antarctic ozone hole that appears each winter may have reached Australia, where scientists reported a 10 percent thinning of the earth's protective shield. Problems are also believed to occur as far north as Santiago and Buenos Aires. Ozone in the upper atmosphere filters out ultraviolet light, which causes skin cancer and might depress the immune system. It can also kill phytoplankton, the microscopic organisms at the bottom of the aquatic food chain. Eastern Europe\n9. Unregulated industry has turned parts of Eastern Europe into an ecological wasteland. Acid rain is killing trees in Poland, East Germany and Czechoslovakia. Pollution is blamed for cancer and mental retardation. Philippines\n10. As much as 95 percent of the coral reefs in the Philippines have been damaged by cyanide, which fishermen dump in the water to scare fish to the surface. As in other rapidly developing areas of Southeast Asia, logging and slash-and-burn agriculture consumes tens of thousands of acres of trees each year on the island of Palawan, the nation's last frontier. China\n11. It is not known whether the droughts in China and the United States were related to the greenhouse effect, but environmentalists say this summer could be a preview of hotter times to come. China already suffers water shortages and pollution from farming and industry. Aral Sea\n12. Diverting water to irrigate cotton has caused the Aral Sea to shrink 40 percent since 1960, leaving behind a vast desert waste. Twenty of the 24 native fish species are gone and dust and salt storms are killing crops. Chernobyl\n13. More than two and a half years after an explosion at a nuclear power plant killed 31 people and forced the evacuation of 135,000, Soviet officials and scientists are debating what to do with the ghost town of Chernobyl: demolish it or decontaminate it and allow its 10,000 inhabitants to return. Hundreds of thousands of Soviet citizens are being monitored for long-term health effects like leukemia."}, {"text": "U.N. Food Agency Sees a Crucial Year Ahead\n1988-12-20T05:00:00.000Z\nThe United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization issued a gloomy year-end assessment today in which it said the world stood at ''a crucial turning point between food security and supply shortages.''\nFor the first time since World War II, global cereal production has declined for two consecutive years, forcing countries to draw deeply from reserves, an agency study said.\nAs a result, it said, world cereal stocks are at their lowest levels since the early 1970's and, more significantly, are below the threshold set by the organization as the minimum requirement for food security.\nThe report said cereal output next year would have to grow by 225 millions tons, or 13 percent, to meet daily needs and rebuild reserves. There has never been a one-year increase of that magnitude, it added.\n''While the world is not facing an immediate food crisis, there are reasons for concern in 1989,'' said Edouard Saouma, the agency's director general. ''The outcome of next year's harvest will be crucial.''\nDespite its bleak tone, the study pointed out some bright spots. For example, cereal production rose by 3 percent in developing countries this year, thanks to good African harvests, including famine-stricken countries like Ethiopia and the Sudan. But the agency said production continued to lag behind population growth in most third-world countries, and it was overwhelmed by climatic disasters in many regions.\nThe severe drought this year in North America cut grain production there by one-third, the report said. There were also floods in Bangladesh, hurricanes in Central America and locust plagues in Africa, the Middle East and the Caribbean that were described by Mr. Saouma as ''the most extensive in recorded history.''\nThus far, crop losses to the locusts have been limited, he said. ''But swarms have the potential to cause enormous damage,'' he added. ''We expect the plague to continue for at least another two to three years.''\nThe organization estimated that total production of wheat, rice and coarse grains this year would total a bit more than 1.73 billion tons, a decline of nearly 4 percent from 1987, which itself was a poor harvest year.\nReserves were expected to total 275 million tons for 1988, a drop of 120 tons, or 30 percent, from last year, the sharpest decline on record. According to the F.A.O., the present stocks are equivalent to 16 percent of expected global cereal consumption next year, and it considers 17 percent as the minimum level ''necessary for the maintenance of world food security.''\nOn another matter, Mr. Saouma, whose fiscal management has been severely criticized in the past, called 1988 the agency's ''worst financial year in its 43-year history.'' The problem was the failure of member nations to meet their obligatory payments, he said, and he called the United States the biggest offender, accounting for $78 million of the total of $111 million owed by 80 countries."}, {"text": "Plane for Bhutan Opens Many Lost Horizons\n1988-11-27T05:00:00.000Z\nThe tiny and remote landlocked Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan took a major new step toward improving its communications with the outside world recently when it bought its first passenger jet.\nA top Bhutanese official said last week that the new plane, a British Aerospace 146 jetliner with 82 seats, will increase the strength of Druk Airways, the kingdom's carrier, to a total of three. The others are small turbo-prop Dorniers bought from West Germany that hold 18 people each and are used between Calcutta and Bhutan. ''This aircraft will play a positive role in the further development of Bhutan,'' said the official, Chi Dorji, Secretary of the Planning Commission. Mr. Dorji said the plane will be used not only to promote tourism but also to ferry cargo from India to Bhutan.\nMost Western visitors to Bhutan travel by air and must stop or make a connection in India or Bangladesh.\nThe current ruler of Bhutan, governed for much of this century by the Wangchuk family, is King Jigme Singye Wangchuk, who sent his Foreign Minister to India a few weeks ago to announce the solemnization of his marriage to four sisters and the declaration of his successor, an 8-year-old boy born to one of the sisters.\nKing Jigme, 32 years old, revered throughout his nation of 1.3 million that has an annual per capital income of $150. One of the poorest countries in the world, Bhutan is cautiously trying to blend its cultural traditions and economic development at its own pace.\nMr. Dorji said the Aid Bhutan Consortium that meets in the French capital every three years had substantially increased its contribution. Explaining that in previous years Bhutan had been getting $45 million a year from the consortium, he said, ''We have been pledged $63 million a year.'' This figure does not include India's aid, which is several times higher.\nHe said that he had to sharply counter demands by those who suggested that Bhutan modernize its economy.\nMr. Dorji said the new plane would would be used to transport people and goods between New Delhi, Bhutan and Calcutta. ''Later we can explore some more areas, maybe Katmandu in Nepal, maybe other places,'' he said.\nHe stressed that Bhutan was not going to open its borders to a flood of tourists. For years, the kingdom has kept mass tourism at bay because it does not want to be swamped by Western influence and because the powerful Buddhist clergy believes that largescale tourism will hurt national character and the morality of the young.\nFor decades, India has played a powerful role in developing Bhutan and keeping other nations out. It bankrolls most of the country's economic plans, has built all-weather roads across tough mountain terrain, trains Bhutanese soldiers and keeps an eye on Chinese troops across the border, has set up a major hydro-electric project that supplies power to the kingdom and is sold to power-hungry Indian states. Under the terms of a 30-year accord, New Delhi also consults regularly with Bhutanese leaders on foreign policy.\nSignificantly too, the Indian Embassy was for many years the only diplomatic mission in Bhutan. It is still the largest although Bangladesh and the United Nations Development Program also have presences there now. Most other foreign embassies operate out of New Delhi and cover Bhutan in occasional visits."}, {"text": "In Bangladesh, Women Can't Go Home Again\n1988-04-17T05:00:00.000Z\nShafia Khatun has made a pioneering journey from rural poverty to a low-paying job in a crowded garment factory, and she may never be able to go home again.\nPart of a small new industry fueled by American imports, she and 200,000 other women have defied Islamic tradition and planted the seeds of a slow social transformation in this nation.\nVillage elders objected to her leaving home to work in the big city, Miss Khatun said in an interview at her tiny dirt-floored rented room. ''It will be difficult for me to live again in my village because I have been in the city earning money,'' she said.\nFor the same reason, and because she cannot afford the traditional wedding payment, her chances of finding a husband have also been reduced, said Miss Khatun, who at the age of 14 is already eligible for marriage.\nThe labor of women like Miss Khatun is a boon to this nation that has relied on exports of animal hides, jute and tea for most of its foreign earnings. Planners here now dare to talk, with guarded hope, of industrialization.\nThe garment boom began here only recently when the United States opened its quotas to Bangladesh while restricting imports from other Asian nations. America now takes in 85 percent of the country's garment exports.\nClothing exports to the United States grew from $45 million in 1984 to more than $300 million last year, making Bangladesh the sixth-largest supplier of apparel to America.\n''This is the cheapest country where you can work,'' said Paolo Tacchinardi, a garment manufacturer from Milan. ''You can pay the workers, the manager and the shipper, and the shirt is still three times less when it arrives in Italy.'' He added: ''You may think that we are wearing things made by women and children. But if we did not come here to give them work, these people would have nothing.''\nRedwan Ahmed, the owner of Saleha Garments Ltd., where Miss Khatun works, said women are essential to his industry.\nBred to subservience, he said, they will work for as little as $13 a month and accept harsh conditions and long hours without complaint.\n''If I appoint 400 men workers, they immediately start making union politics,'' he said. ''Not the women.''\nAnd with the low salaries they are willing to accept, he said, ''You get more workers for less investment.''\nRoushan Jahan, a scholar who has researched the new phenomenon of women workers, said factory owners sometimes lock their doors to keep women at their places for overtime work. She said the women often have too little schooling to compute the wages due them and are frequently shortchanged.\nDeepening poverty and landlessness throughout the country has forced a compromise with cultural norms, said Mrs. Jahan.\nIn traditional Bangladesh, women are in effect the property of their fathers or husbands. They receive less education, less food and poorer health care than their brothers.\nMiss Jahan said women had traditionally worked at home or in the homes of neighbors but that in times of famine or calamity, tradition had been set aside and women had been sent out to help in the fields or to scavenge.\nThe continuing crisis of poverty and overpopulation has now reached a level at which the social norms themselves may be changing, she said. Miss Khatun said her widowed mother had sent her to work because she could no longer afford to feed her.\nWhile some workers manage to send home a part of their earnings, Miss Khatun said she could barely survive on her own and was helping her family simply by feeding herself.\nAt work on her own, she said, she tries to maintain the standards of propriety to which she was bred, although she may already have cut herself off from a respectable future.\nShe said she leaves her home only for the short walk to her workplace and avoids improper comportment.\nAlthough she sometimes allows herself to watch television through the window of a neighbor, she said, she leaves whenever a movie is shown.\n''It is not proper for a young girl to watch a movie,'' she said."}, {"text": "ANSWERS TO QUIZ\n1988-09-10T05:00:00.000Z\nQuestions appear on page 14.\n1.

All that survived were eroding traces of raised, rectangular platforms of earth alternating with canals in a corduroy pattern across acre after acre of flat expanse. Modern-day Peruvian Indians called the platforms ''waru waru'' and considered them to be signs left behind by a revered ''first race'' who ruled the area before the Incas came.\nIn a dramatic resurrection, modern-day Peruvians using ancient implements have reconstructed the raised-platform fields according to specifications derived from the archeological digs.\nThe prehistoric technology has proved so productive, so hardy and so inexpensive in its modern application that it is being held out as a possible alternative for wide stretches of the Third World where scarce resources and harsh local conditions have frustrated the advance of the high-tech Green Revolution.\nFields constructed and planted according to what has been termed ''raised-field agriculture'' require no chemical fertilizer or modern machinery. They cost almost nothing, except human labor. They are farmed with variants of ancient implements rather than expensive tractors and plows. They have outyielded conventional, capital-intensive fields as producers of potatoes, one of the region's main crops both in pre-Colombian days and now. When conventional fields die in a drought or flood, these mostly survive.\n''It's fantastic,'' says Dr. William Denevan, an archeologist at the University of Wisconsin who was one of the first to discover the remains of the prehistoric platforms 20 years ago. ''Here's a whole system, abandoned before any Europeans came, now being restored by the local community.'' Today's Green Revolution, based on heavy use of fertilizer and machinery, has not been able to penetrate everywhere or to all population groups, notes David Bathrick, the director of the United States Agency for International Development's office of agriculture.\nMr. Bathrick headed his agency's agricultural mission in Peru during the early years of the raised-field experiment and has visited the fields. They could, he said, become part of what he called a ''second Green Revolution,'' aimed at less hospitable areas of the Third World, where flood, cold, heat, and drought routinely pose special difficulties, and where modern agricultural technology has not moved beyond the more favorable plains and river basins. They might be especially useful, say those who have restored them, in areas subject to frequent flooding, such as in Bangladesh or the Ganges plain in India.\nSince the first discoveries of the platforms in the 1960's, millions of them have been found across Latin America, leading some archeologists to believe that they undergirded the pre-Colombian economy. At least one previous attempt to revive them has been made in Mexico, using modern machinery and methods and lacking the precise, critical specifications yielded by archeological studies.\nBut it fell to Dr. Clark Erickson, an archeologist at the University of Pennsylvania's Museum of Archaeology/Anthropology, to find out how the raised fields worked in practice, how they were farmed, what made them so successful and therefore so widespread.\nDr. Erickson, who was at the University of Illinois when he and the interdisciplinary team he headed did the work, has described it in detail in two reports scheduled for publication next month and next spring. The work began in 1981 and is continuing.\nHe did not set out to devise any practical, modern-day application, he said in an interview. Going beyond the usual and familiar excavation techniques that are the mainstay of archeology, he undertook an exercise in experimental archeology, a branch of the science in which investigators try to recreate ancient conditions and put to use ancient artifacts as a way of answering scientific questions. In this particular exercise, near the Peruvian community of Huatta on a northwestern bay of Lake Titicaca, Dr. Erickson sought to use the findings of his excavations to re-create, in real life, not only the fields but the way in which the ancients had organized and cultivated them.\nWhen that had been done and the results were in, he said, ''we realized it was such a fantastic system that maybe it could be re-introduced to the region as a replacement for some of the capital-intensive systems'' of farming that depend on machinery, fertilizer and lots of money.\nEroded remains of the pre-Colombian raised-field platforms and canals of various sizes cover more than 200,000 acres of the low-lying plains around Lake Titicaca. The raised platforms of earth that were central to the technology generally range from 13 to 33 feet wide, 33 to 330 feet long, and about three feet high. It is on these earthen platforms that crops were planted. Between them are canals of like size and depth. The platforms were constructed of earth, including topsoil, that was removed to make the canals.\nBy analyzing soil and ancient pollen from the platforms and canals, Dr. Erickson's team learned that the sediment in the prehistoric canals was much richer in plant nutrients than the soil of the plain that surrounded them. The investigators also found pollen grains of potato and quinoa, a high-protein grain that grows in the United States as a weed called lamb's quarters but has been domesticated as a major food crop in South America since ancient times.\nUsing radio-carbon dating and other techniques, the team found, to its surprise, that the system of raised fields and canals dated to about 1000 B.C., making it not a brief, late phenomenon, as had been previously suspected, but apparently one of the earliest and most stable forms of intensive agriculture. Successive layers indicated that the fields had been re-built several times from about 1000 B.C. to about 1,400 A.D.\nOver the centuries since, the platforms were eroded and the canals filled in to such an extent that their original dimensions were hidden. The archeological excavations stripped away that veil, revealing the original canal depth and ridge spacing, and these dimensions were used in the experimental phase of the project. Reconstruction of some of the fields began in 1981. Cultivation has continued since, and Dr. Erickson estimated that up to 200 acres are now being cultivated.\nTraditional Andean tools, including a prehistoric plow operated by foot, were used to dig the new canals. Teams of three people were found to be the most efficient work unit. Two used footplows to cut blocks of sod from the old canals between the ridges, while the third tossed the sod blocks onto the field surface. This produced a layer of rich topsoil on the raised platform. Typically, 10 to 50 such groups from the same locality would work a given field.\nDuring the first five years of experimentation, potato yields averaged 10 metric tons per hectare compared with 1 to 4 metric tons on surrounding conventional fields. This was so, Dr. Erickson reported, even though the conventional fields used fertilizers and the experimental fields did not. What the experimenters did use was the green algae that collected in the bottom of the canal, rich in nitrogen, that was shoveled onto the platforms during the dry season. Archeological evidence suggests that the ancients did the same thing.\nThe added nutrients meant that it was not necessary for the fields to periodically lie fallow. t Water in the canals enabled the experimental crops, including particularly large stands of grain, to survive a severe 1983 drought that caused widespread crop loss elsewhere in the area. The fields' elevation enabled them to survive the worst lake flood in years, in 1986, while crops in other fields all around were inundated. And by retaining solar radiation, the canal water warmed the raised fields and the air above them, limiting the danger of frost.\nThe larger the complex of raised fields and canals, Dr. Erickson said, ''the better for the microclimate effect.'' In the experiment, communal land-holding groups of Quechua Indians, ranging in size from 30 to 150 families, banded together to create and cultivate the fields. Smaller extended family groups can also do it, said the archeologist.\nBecause of this, and because the method is inexpensive and simple in its very sophistication, raised fields ''may be an economical and ecologically sound alternative to agricultural development based on expensive imported technology,'' Dr. Erickson has written in an article for publication in ''Expedition,'' the University Museum's journal.\nWhy did the technology die out originally? Does it make sense to put it back into operation without knowing the reason?\nSeismic activity, massive floods or droughts, climatic changes: All, Dr. Erickson said, have been advanced as explanations but not proved. Dr. Erickson believes that the field system expanded to support population centers that grew up in pre-Inca antiquity. When power and influence shifted to other areas and empires rose and fell, he suggests, fields were withdrawn from production and abandoned and the art was forgotten."}, {"text": "AT LEAST 700 DEAD IN A MAJOR QUAKE IN THE HIMALAYAS\n1988-08-22T05:00:00.000Z\nA devastating earthquake rumbled across eastern India and Nepal before dawn Sunday, killing more than 700 people.\nThe authorities said that many victims were still buried in the debris of their homes and that the final toll could be much higher. The quake, which registered 6.5 on the Richter scale, according to the Seismological Observatory in New Delhi, struck the region soon after 4 A.M. Sunday and lasted nearly 45 seconds. Aftershocks went on for about an hour, the observatory said.\nReports in Indian newspapers this morning said that more than 450 people had been killed in Bihar state. The Nepalese Home Ministry confirmed 252 deaths there.\nIt was the most severe earthquake in the Himalayan region since one in the Assam region killed more than 1,000 people in 1950. Thousands of Houses Wrecked\nMost of the deaths in Bihar were reported in Darbhanga, Munger and Madhubani districts, where officials said more than 25,000 dwellings were destroyed.\nIndian newspapers reported today that at least 10,000 people had been injured in Bihar. Officials in Nepal said that more than 1,000 were injured and that thousands of houses had collapsed.\nVolunteer relief groups, the Red Cross organizations in both countries, policemen, soldiers and local residents began digging for bodies and taking injured survivors to hospitals.\n''Reports of casualties are pouring in from the affected areas,'' the Government television station in Bihar reported. Obstructed by Landslides\nLandslides disrupted communications, preventing officials from obtaining information about the remote areas, said V. K. Sharma, a deputy secretary in the Bihar state government, by telephone late Sunday. ''The tolls have come in only from urban areas.'' Mr. Sharma spoke from Patna, the capital of Bihar.\nThe monsoon rain, which began in late June, was also hindering rescue operations. More than 50 villages were said to have been flooded after embankments shifted as a result of the earthquake today.\nTremors of varying intensities were felt in a 1,000-mile belt from India's eastern tip in Nagaland, sweeping across Bangladesh to New Delhi in the north and the central city of Jabalpur. Buildings cracked and fell, windowpanes and doors rattled, and tens of thousands of Indians and Nepalese fled into streets and open spaces.\nMost of the victims were asleep when the quake struck. ''My bed rattled, then it began swinging,'' said R. N. Rudram a resident of Patna. ''My dogs began barking and I ran out of the house.''\nThe Chief Minister of Bihar state, Bhajwat Jha Azad, traveled to the quake area and announced immediate relief payments of 5,000 rupees, equivalent to about $400, to the relatives of each person killed.\nMr. Azad ordered members of his cabinet to the devastated areas to supervise relief and rescue operations. The Indian national Government sent doctors, nurses, aid workers and medicine from New Delhi to Bihar. Dry Wells, Broken Roads\nThe massive landslides blocked roads, isolating towns and villages in the Nepalese-Indian border belt, and disrupting communications and rail lines. A news agency report quoted residents of Lahan, in southeastern Nepal, as saying that wells had dried up and the main highway had been riven by six-foot-wide fissures.\nThe devastation was largely confined to Bihar, an impoverished state, and eastern Nepal, including Dharan district, where about 150 deaths were reported.\nAt 6.5, the earthquake was one classified as capable of causing severe damage. Still, it was less powerful than the quake of 1934, which killed 13,000 people in Bihar and Nepal and which measured 8 on the Richter scale - 15 times stronger than the one today.\nIt was the most severe earthquake in the region since the one in Assam in 1950, which raised the level of the Brahmaputra River. Two weeks ago, a strong tremor shook northeastern india and Bangladesh; there were few fatalities then.\nH.N. Srivastava, director of the New Delhi Seismological Observatory, said the epicenter of Sunday's quake was about 40 miles northeast of Darbhanga on the border with Nepal. Royal Birthday Deferred\nIn Nepal on Sunday, officials announced a postponement of the birthday celebrations of the Queen Mother because of the disaster.\nPrime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India announced plans to visit Bihar today to survey the damage.\nDr. Srivastava, the seismologist, said the tremors were caused by the rubbing of the Indian land mass, known in geophysical terms as the Indian Plate, and the Eurasian Plate in the Himalaya mountain range, which forced sudden movements in underground faults in the mountain system.\nThe Indian Plate moves north and northeast about two inches a year, he said. The Eurasian Plate is stationary, and earthquakes in the belt running from Kashmir to Burma are caused by the grating of the two land masses, he said.\n''This is a continuing process,'' Dr. Srivastava said, adding that more earthquakes are likely in the coming years in the same region."}, {"text": "Spring, in the Greenhouse\n1988-04-03T05:00:00.000Z\nEaster commemorates resurrection, Passover deliverance. With ancient roots in the spring equinox, both rites serve to mark the renewal of nature's cycle. As is becoming slowly evident, that cycle is too easy to take for granted.\nIndustrial activity has begun to affect the world's atmosphere in ways that threaten to induce profound changes in climate. The ''ozone hole'' that has recently opened up over Antarctica offers a sharp warning: Pay heed to the broader climatic changes known as the greenhouse effect.\nAs waste gases build up in the atmosphere, they absorb heat that would otherwise radiate out into space. Scientists have long feared that this process would start to heat the atmosphere, in the way that glass traps the heat in a greenhouse. Even a few degrees' rise in average global temperature could have extreme regional consequences.\nThe climate would change, probably making the Midwest hotter and shifting America's grain belt north into Canada. The Gulf Stream might shift course, ceasing to warm Europe. Sea level would rise a foot or two as the oceans expanded, flooding low-lying areas like America's East Coast and Bangladesh. Should the Western Antarctic ice cap melt, the sea would rise 20 feet, inundating New York, New Orleans, London, Beijing.\nThat's the fearful scenario some scientists say is possible. But is it likely?\nThe answer lies in a puzzle that may take another decade to complete. Important pieces are already in place. The greenhouse gases are already accumulating. Carbon dioxide created by the burning of fossil fuels has steadily increased since the Industrial Revolution. Chlorofluorocarbons or CFC's, used as refrigerants, also heat the atmosphere. Because of their separate effect in eroding the life-protecting ozone layer, a recent international agreement will slowly limit production.\nGiven the steady rise in greenhouse gases, is the atmosphere warming up as predicted? It's too early to say. Average surface temperatures have risen half a degree centigrade since 1861. Last year was the warmest on record, followed by 1981 and 1983. But three warm summers still don't send an unmistakable signal and uncertainty masks others.\nSo why not wait and collect more data, as the Reagan Administration proposes? Such calm seems appealing compared with the cost of overreaction. Recall the swine flu vaccination campaign, or the millions poured into synfuels plants. Moreover, the greenhouse gases may produce their own antidotes. Rising humidity could increase cloud cover and cool the Earth, plants might grow faster and absorb more carbon dioxide.\nYet hysteria and overreaction are not the only responses available. Each decade of delay may commit the atmosphere to further warming. A greenhouse effect might intensify itself by slowing the oceans' absorption of carbon dioxide. Meanwhile, several of the proposed remedies are worth taking anyway - like further reducing CFC's; retarding destruction of the world's tropical forests; conserving energy and looking for safer ways to generate nuclear power.\nA primary need is for more detailed monitoring of the atmosphere, which suggests a fine planetary assignment for NASA - a mission to Earth to give earliest possible warning of the greenhouse signal. But even as research continues, it's time to take the first practical steps in averting a trend that could derange nature's rebirth and renewal."}, {"text": "NEWS SUMMARY\n1988-09-06T05:00:00.000Z\nInternational A3-17\nBangladesh flooding has killed 550 people and left 30 million homeless.

Its rivers don't catch fire anymore. Raw sewage usually ends up in treatment plants, not the nearest river basin. That much has been accomplished by the environmental laws of the early 1970's. Yet the campaign is only half won because tighter controls have been offset by the extra pollution from economic growth. Worse, society now confronts a new generation of environmental dangers, more insidious, far-reaching and intractable than the old.\nThe thinning of the life-protecting ozone layer in the high atmosphere is one such threat. Global warming - the feared greenhouse effect - is another. Air pollution, like acid rain and smog, is eroding the life of lakes and forests throughout North America and Europe. Pollutants draining off city streets and farms poison the coastal waters on which many estuarine and oceanic species depend. The world's richest nurseries of life, the tropical forests, are being destroyed at a horrifying rate: about six acres a minute.\nThe summer of '88 bristled with warnings, yet this second generation of environmental threats is not well understood. How can society find the money, courage and global cooperation to conquer them? There could hardly be a more urgent issue for debate in a Presidential campaign. Yet where are the ideas of the candidates, the men who profess to lead the way against the urgencies of the 1990's?\nThe old environmental problems consisted of visible threats to human health or comfort, often emanating from a single source like a plant or toxic dump. The remedies were clear enough: Make the offending industry pay to install pollution controls or clean up.\nThe new generation of problems is far harder to tackle. The sources are many and diverse, the damage often invisible or indirect. The victims are the ecology and atmosphere, with delayed damage to human well-being.\nPowerful interests inhibit the search for solutions. Just last week, under pressure from utilities and the coal and auto industries, Congress gave up once again on efforts to combat acid rain and smog through reform of the Clean Air Act.\nWhen Vice President Bush and Governor Dukakis talk environment, it's about barely relevant issues like Boston harbor and offshore oil drilling. Any remedies the candidates might propose are cramped by the immense debt run up by the Reagan Administration. Yet whoever wins cannot hope to escape the issue, any more than voters can escape thinking about it. Heat and Light as Killers\nHumans have always thought the atmosphere to be so vast, so imbued with counteractive forces, that pollutants could make only the most gradual changes. No longer. The ''ozone hole'' that was discovered over Antarctica in 1985 seems to have been caused by minuscule amounts of man-made chlorine that reached the high atmosphere.\nOzone, though hazardous to plants and animals at ground level, serves as a life-protecting shield, screening out the sun's ultraviolet light that would otherwise cause an epidemic of skin cancer. Aside from the ozone hole, which mercifully is so far limited to Antarctica, chlorine seems to have caused a 3 percent thinning of the worldwide ozone shield in the last 20 years.\nA corresponding surge in the ultra-violet light reaching earth has not yet been detected. But that's no reason for delay against so profound a threat to all forms of life. Last year, at the urging of the United States, several governments signed the Montreal Protocol, an agreement to freeze and then halve their production of CFC's, the industrial chemicals that carry chlorine up to the ozone layer. That's only a first step.\nCFC's take some 15 years to waft up to the ozone layer: destruction of ozone would continue that long even if all CFC's were banned tomorrow. A complete, worldwide ban on CFC's and the related halons cannot come too quickly. The next President has some hard diplomacy ahead.\nThe Montreal Protocol may be a model for addressing another worldwide threat, the greenhouse effect. A group of waste gases, chiefly carbon dioxide, CFC's and methane, trap heat from the earth's surface that would otherwise escape to space. Carbon dioxide, released by burning coal, oil and wood, has been steadily collecting over the last century. Theory suggests the world's atmosphere should already have started to warm.\nFour of the last eight summers have been the warmest in a century. The drought in the United States and the floods in Bangladesh are exactly the effects expected in a greenhouse-warmed climate. These are ominous warnings, but fall far short of proof that the global warming has begun. Yet if prevention is delayed until proof is irrefutable, a profound set of irreversible changes in the earth's climate will already have been set in motion. Rain patterns and crop ranges will shift toward the equator. The Gulf Stream may shift course, ceasing to warm Europe. If the West Antarctic ice cap melts, sea level could rise 20 feet, forcing the evacuation of New Orleans, New York, London and Beijing.\nWhat remedies are sensible to contemplate? There's little justification yet for the enormously costly step of abandoning the use of coal. But several insurance measures against greenhouse warming are worthwhile in their own right. Banning CFC's is one. Saving tropical forests is another, since trees absorb carbon dioxide. American cars, houses, and appliances could all use energy more efficiently, with fewer waste gases.\nNuclear power plants produce neither carbon dioxide nor the gases that form acid rain. Development of a new kind of nuclear reactor, inherently safe and affordable, is a practical priority -but one scandalously neglected by the Reagan Administration. Nature as Victim\nAmericans have no idea how much waste their life style engenders: a yearly 25 tons per person. Only 3 percent of that is household garbage; most comes from industry, agriculture, sewage plants and incinerators. Toxic waste is now sent to monitored dumps.\nBut much of the rest escapes, brutally testing the resilience of natural systems.\nNearest to crisis are the nation's coastal waters and estuaries. More than $300 billion has been spent on controlling water pollution since 1972. Yet with millions of people crowding the coastlines - by 2000, 75 percent of the United States population will live within 50 miles of shore - the deluge of waste is overwhelming.\nCoastal waters are being poisoned by pesticides flushed off farms and suburban yards. Nitrogen from treated sewage and fertilizer runoff stimulates algae blooms that suffocate fish. Chesapeake Bay, Long Island Sound and San Francisco Bay are all at grave risk. Urgent reform of farm practices is one remedy. Another is to upgrade sewage plants and combined storm-sewer lines like New York's, that overflow after heavy rainfall.\nEastern lakes and forests are threatened by acid rain. Injected into westerly winds by tall smokestacks in the Ohio valley, waste gases mingle with moisture and fall as mild acid in the Adirondacks, New England and Canada. Under the continual chemical assault, many lakes have died.\nForests are also beginning to show the first signs of widespread decline. In the Northeast, red spruce and maple are dwindling. Growth rates of yellow pines in the South have dropped by half over the last 30 years. The damage is even more serious in the industrial heartland of Europe. Air pollution is almost certainly to blame, with acid rain and ground-level ozone the leading suspects. The next President will have little time to prevent Appalachia's forests from going the way of Europe's. Tropical forests face a more immediate threat. Governments like Brazil's disastrously encourage settlers to clear forest land for agriculture. But the soil, despite the forests' luxuriance, is poor. It yields a few years' crops, then reverts to wasteland, and the settlers move on to burn still more forest. In Brazil's province of Rondonia, home to a fifth of the world's plant and animal species, 17 percent of the forest is already gone. The 170,000 fires counted last year in the western Amazon contributed a tenth of the world's production of carbon dioxide.\nThe richness of tropical forests is the fruit of 50 million years of uninterrupted evolution. That millions of species and their home should be destroyed so wantonly is a historic offense, even though no law recognizes it.\nPersuading countries with tropical forests to preserve them is an urgent duty for the next President.\nThere is little in either Presidential candidate's record that displays deep understanding of environmental issues, although Michael Dukakis passed legislation in Massachusetts to curb acid rain, and George Bush has now broken with the Administration in calling for an acid rain program.\nBut ready or not, the next President will have the issues forced upon him. Persuading Americans to endure immediate costs for a long-term benefit will take leadership. Negotiating with other countries jointly to avert unproven risks will require statesmanship.\nThe alternative is a steady, perhaps even catastrophic decline of the natural systems on which life depends."}, {"text": "Micro-loans to the World's Poorest\n1988-02-21T05:00:00.000Z\nWITH the help of 5 of her 12 children and a son-in-law, Maria Alfonsa Lopez braids rope in La Colonia Independencia, one of the western hill barrios of Tegucigalpa, Honduras. It is an occupation her family has pursued for generations.\nThanks to four loans totaling $400 from a three-year-old community group called Asepade, a Spanish acronym for investment adviser, she has broken the grip of the local moneylender. He had been charging her 10 percent a day to finance her stock of rope, which she twists into clotheslines, hammocks and lassos.\n''The loans have helped me quite a lot, and I am now able to earn a profit,'' she said in a recent telephone conversation from Tegucigalpa.\nShe has used the profits to expand her business and to install a cement floor in the shack where she lives with her family in the dusty satellite community.\nMrs. Lopez is one of 2,500 individuals in the Tegucigalpa area who have received entrepreneurial loans from Asepade over the past three years.\nThroughout the third world, from Bangladesh and Senegal to Tegucigalpa, such loans, from a variety of donors, have helped several million small entrepreneurs - those who sell flowers, mangoes and papayas, braid rope, sew dresses, catch fish and perform other small-scale activities that are at the core of developing economies.\nThe practice of microenterprise lending began in the early 1980's and grew slowly, but from the experience to date, most experts agree that it works.\nNot only is there an excellent repayment record, but also a ''trickle up'' effect on the local economy. Profits from Mrs. Lopez's rope making, for example, meant an extra order for the local cement mixer who made her new floor. Prospering entrepreneurs may also hire additional help.\n''IT generates a flow of money,'' said Wayne G. Broehl, professor of administration at the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration at Dartmouth. ''And as you heighten the money economy, then you make new opportunities for other people, providing a real multiplier effect.''\nA shortage of working capital is generally perceived as one of the biggest obstacles to third world development. ''The capitalist model depends on resources flowing easily to the opportunities,'' said Howard H. Stevenson, enterprise professor at the Harvard Business School. In developing countries, he added, ''what strikes me is how tightly controlled the resources are. It is impossible to pursue the opportunities.'' Microenterprise lending can break the logjam.\nThe local enterprises are not big enough to qualify for bank loans. To buy additional raw materials or a wider net to catch more fish, people who need cash must generally turn to local loan sharks who charge up to 20 percent a day in interest.\nThe ''trickle up'' programs, by contrast, usually charge interest rates of 2 to 4 percent a month, amounts comparable to commercial bank rates in the particular countries.\n''Once there is a source of credit at commercial rates, costs drop, income rises and there is more money for tortillas or rope,'' said Stephen H. Gross, associate director for Latin American operations of Accion International, a nonprofit development organization. ''Suddenly you are increasing buying power of a large number of people and recyling money into the economy.''\nAccion, which provides funds for Asepade, the community group that helped Mrs. Lopez, is among a score of organizations that are behind the entrepreneurial movement.\nTheir seed money comes from private and public benefactors, including multinational corporations, foundations, the Agency for International Development of the State Department, and multinational agencies such as the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the United Nations Development Program.\nA few third world banks, like the Commercial and Savings Bank of Somalia and the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, practice micro-lending and make it profitable by keeping transaction costs low.\nBoston-based Accion, an acronym for Americans for Community Cooperation in Other Nations, is financed by such organizations as the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Exxon, I.B.M. and the Agency for International Development.\nStarted during the Kennedy Administration, Accion also sends volunteers to work in Latin American slums.\nANALYZING its experience in 13 Latin American countries, Accion discovered that a loan of $30 can double a small merchant's family income in six months, according to William W. Burrus, the executive director. The group also found that every $1,100 lent to small enterprises generates one additional job.\nThe concept of helping cash-short entrepreneurs with small-scale loans appears to have originated in Bangladesh with an economics professor named Muhammad Yunus, who studied at Vanderbilt University and returned to teach at the University of Chittagong.\nHe founded the Grameen Bank in 1979 after arguing with conventional bankers that the 50 percent of Bangladeshis who are landless and the 80 percent who are illiterate could still be good credit risks.\nToday the bank, which is 75 percent-owned by its borrowers (who must be savers and, eventually, buy shares in the bank), with the remainder owned by the government, operates 330 branches serving 6,000 Bangladesh villages, and is handling 215,000 loans, more than half of them to women.\nThis and other small credit programs evolved in response to growing frustration with large-scale assistance projects.\nAccording to early economic development theories, the benefits of big investments in power plants, hydroelectric stations, irrigation works and highways were expected to ''trickle down'' through an economy and lift the living standards of the poor.\nBut after decades of commitments of many billions of dollars living standards have actually fallen in some countries. (This year alone the World Bank, the biggest of the multilateral lenders, will channel nearly $20 billion to about 80 countries.) Influenced by the spread of ''trickle up'' entrepreneurialism, development policy is increasingly shifting to programs that have a direct impact on peoples' lives, grass-roots projects that fill basic needs for food, shelter, education and health services.\n''The big infrastructure projects are still needed to improve overall economic performance,'' said John W. Sewell, president of the Overseas Development Council, a research organization specializing in third world issues. ''But these entrepreneurial programs - which really do demonstrate the magic of the marketplace - clearly deserve to be supported.''\nThe ''trickle up'' approach has also won strong backing in Congress, which late last year passed legislation instructing the Agency for International Development to direct $50 million in the current fiscal year and $75 million next year to finance third world small-credit programs.\n''It represents a dramatic new direction in foreign assistance,'' said Representative Edward F. Feighan, Democrat of Ohio, who introduced the legislation in the House along with Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, Republican of New York.\nDennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona, one of 50 Senate sponsors, said that among other things he believes the small loans will counter the narcotics trade.\nHe said that in Bolivia cocaine depends on a cheap supply of migrant laborers to harvest coca leaves. Out of economic necessity, thousands of Bolivian workers migrate to the coca-producing lowlands to earn income from this harvest.\nHe cited studies by the Foundation for International Community Assistance (Finca) - an organization similar to Accion - showing that a $50 loan provides enough working capital to encourage such alternatives as making cloth or marketing vegetables.\nAll of the operators of the small loan programs report a high repayment rate. Mr. Gross of Accion says that fewer than 1 percent of the borrowers default. The Grameen Bank of Bangladesh reports a repayment rate of better than 97 percent. So does Finca, an acronym for farm in Spanish, which operates a network of 600 banks with 32,000 borrowers in Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, Costa Rica and El Salvador.\n''The poor are bankable,'' said Idriss Jazairy, president of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, which provided $3.4 million to the Grameen Bank for its seminal village lending program in 1980.\nMost such programs are based on a solidarity principle. Although loans are made to individual entrepreneurs, each individual is in a group of four or five others who are in line for similar credits. Together they act as co-guarantors. If one individual is unable to make timely payments, credit for the entire group is jeopardized, which results in heavy peer-group pressure on the delinquent.\nIn the Grameen model an individual joins a group of five borrowers who meet weekly with an officer of the bank trained in small-scale financial activities. He provides management advice. All repayments take place at the group meetings.\nAt first only two members of the group are allowed to apply for a loan. Depending on their repayments, the next two borrowers can apply, and then the fifth.\nGrameen entrepreneurs have used their money for the purchase of cows, cycle repairing, weaving, pottery and even perfume making.\n''We are not doing any favors. We are in business,'' Mr. Yunus said in an interview with a New York Times correspondent in Bangladesh.\nAccording to Mr. Yunus and other experts, the small-credit activity offers exciting possibilities.\n''You could enter into a huge market of banking specifically oriented to profit-making loans to the poor,'' said Jeffrey Ashe, a Boston economic consultant. He envisions whole networks of small-loan shops. ''I'd love to see franchisable McDonald's or Burger King-type money stores accessing this particular market,'' he said.\nBut high transaction costs are a formidable barrier to financial institutions in developed countries.\n''IT'S very far afield for most commercial bankers,'' said Mary Houghton, president of the South Shore Bank of Chicago, which runs such programs in the United States through a nonprofit unit of the bank. For the past 15 years, South Shore's owners have wanted the bank to turn a profit, but also play a role in urban neighborhood redevelopment.\nIn the third world, however, village banking benefits from economies of scale. Since many of the loans are similar, a single bank representative may monitor the progress of thousands of loans weekly.\nIn countries with high unemployment rates, the job-making potential of microenterprise lending is particularly appealing to policy makers.\nRamon Uceta makes furniture in the Dominican Republic's capital of Santo Domingo. He borrowed $67 initially from the local Accion affiliate, and now 33 months and 13 progressively larger loans later, he employs 14 workers and lives in a new development in a house with running water and electricity.\nBefore he entered the program he was paying 20 percent a month to loan sharks. Now his interest rates are down to 1 1/2 percent a month.\nIn Cali, the third-largest city of Colombia, loans of about $50 enabled a group of women to start a business. They first bought sewing machines, then banded together to make baby clothes now sold in Colombian shops.\nAlthough there is a growing body of encouraging experience with small loans, many experts caution against excessively high expectations, noting that there is no single, simple answer to the problem of raising living standards around the world.\n''How do you cause small-scale enterprise to spread rapidly enough to make a difference?'' asked Robert L. Payton, scholar in residence in philanthropic studies at the University of Virginia and a former ambassador to Cameroon in West Africa.\n''The African economies are much more open to this activity than they used to be,'' when government-ownedengineering projects were in favor, he said. ''It's all very encouraging. But you can't throw money at it. You can't push it faster than it will go.''

''I tell them stories of famous people and say, 'These people were just like you and they have become great people because they went to school.' ''\nGulshanara Begum, the young headmistress, said that of 852 school-age children in the area, just 238 were enrolled in the little Aingan school at the edge of the rice fields 30 miles northeast of Dhaka.\nMost children, she said, drop out to help their families after just two years of schooling, not really enough to become literate.\nOn one recent school day, only half of those enrolled were at class. The others, Mrs. Gulshanara said, were busy watering the fields, weeding, fishing and gathering firewood. 'Who Knows the Answer?'\nInside Nazma's classroom, her teacher, in a threadbare white shirt and trousers, gripped his bamboo rod and demanded angrily, ''Two plus two, who knows the answer?''\nIn the rice paddy outside, a child with a basket of pumpkins on her head walked by, her image reflected in the bright water of the paddy fields.\nA boy with a bamboo stick just like that of the teacher brought two thin cows to graze in the small field beside the schoolhouse.\nAlmost as far as the bamboo trees that shelter Nazma's house, the voices of the schoolchildren could be heard as they learned the numbers: ''One god, two worlds, three earths, four caliphs.''\nGiven the poverty and lack of education of the villagers, Mrs. Mumtaj described the role of a teacher as extending well beyond the school's walls. Advice on Health and Land\n''They come to me for advice on things like health care and land questions,'' she said. ''They even ask my opinion on marriage questions.''\nThe headmistress, Mrs. Gulshanara, said she had taken short courses in nutrition and family planning, and spent much of her time talking to villagers on these subjects.\nIn the classroom, she said, she tries to engage the children's minds and to teach them to think.\nIn an innovation of her own, she said, she has divided her classes into groups for debates on such subjects as literacy and small families. Poverty Hampers Work\n''Of course, they are young,'' she said. ''They have trouble articulating their ideas. But at least they try.''\nShe said her work is hampered by the poverty of the school.\nHer bare, concrete-floored classroom was furnished with a water jug, an umbrella, whisk brooms and a blackboard that hung from the wall on fraying ropes.\nThe children, who write on small slates, have no rulers or maps or toys or musical instruments, she said, and the school has no ball for sports."}, {"text": "TV Review; 'Politics of Food,' on Channel 13\n1988-01-06T05:00:00.000Z\n''THE Politics of Food'' examines worldwide hunger and finds it's the fault of the West. Western creditors and governments, particularly the United States, have joined to choke off world food supplies. The two-hour documentary, on Channel 13 at 10 o'clock tonight, is provocative, but it doesn't have much breadth.\nThe documentary - produced by an international consortium headed by Britain's Yorkshire Television, and narrated by Martin Sheen -visits Minnesota, Brazil, the Sudan, Bangladesh and India. Dispossessed farmers in Minnesota, it finds, have conterparts in the third world; they are all burdened by debt, manipulated by creditors and forced off the land by big business.\nConsequently, much of the world goes hungry, even though there is ample food. The world distribution process, the documentary says, is faulty. Grain and other surpluses pile up in the West, while millions of people starve to death or suffer from malnutrition.\nThe documentary is persuasive about this. How could it not be? The West does indeed have food surpluses, and much of the world does starve. Why does this happen? The documentary suggests that a principal villain is the World Bank, which forces debtor nations to grow cash crops, rather than food that will feed their people.\nNonetheless, the documentary does seem a shade simplistic. Revolutions and wars, one thinks, have done at least as much to disrupt third-world food supplies as bureaucrats in Washington or on Wall Street. At the same time, ''The Politics of Food'' is ambivalent about centralized economies. Are they good or bad? The documentary wants it both ways.\nThus it pleads for family farmers the world over; it argues for rural economies, where governments and banks stay off the farmers' backs. That's decentralization. On the other hand, the only bright spot the documentary seems able to find is a region in India that makes grants to the poor, practices land reform and regulates food prices. That's not decentralization.\nOn television, however, the region is prettily filmed. Mr. Sheen says the inhabitants even elect Communists to office, and that the system is such that ''everything is shared more equally.'' Well, perhaps, but surely world hunger is more complicated than that.\nThe documentary concludes with a warning about ''antidemocratic structures.'' It says they ''are the main cause of hunger.'' That's sufficiently vague to include many things, but whatever they are, they all have their roots in the West. ''The Politics of Food'' is interesting, but it never looks beyond its own horizon."}, {"text": "Feed the Hungry\n1988-09-03T05:00:00.000Z\nLEAD: Dazzling advances in research and ever-increasing harvests in many developing countries have not been able to protect the world's poor from malnutrition. But a simple rethinking of the ways governments give food assistance may achieve what high tech has not.\nDazzling advances in research and ever-increasing harvests in many developing countries have not been able to protect the world's poor from malnutrition. But a simple rethinking of the ways governments give food assistance may achieve what high tech has not.\nSuch rethinking is now under way in some of the neediest and most debt-distressed countries. The best of their new food programs show that it is possible to reduce malnutrition substantially, quickly and affordably - without fostering dependence on welfare. The key is to target food program to those in need. Obvious? Yes, but too many programs have squandered benefits on those who do not require special attention.\nUntil recently, Brazil's annual $1 billion wheat subsidy was available to the rich and poor alike. In a number of African countries, subsidies go to foods like meat and butter, which are out of the reach of the poor even with the subsidy - and the poor continue to go hungry.\nAn income test would seem the most sensible approach to deciding who gets benefits, but it is often unworkable. Even in the United States, where income reporting is systematized, the food stamp program has been jeopardized by charges of abuse. In the developing world, where income is less documented and often takes the form of food a family grows for itself, determining eligibility by income is next to impossible.\nSome countries have found creative, alternative ways to reach the neediest. They target programs by place, type of food, age and signs of faltering growth in children, or even by season. In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, several countries are beginning to concentrate food resources in scarce months, before the harvest, when malnutrition is most severe.\nThailand and Brazil now focus on regions where malnutrition is concentrated, in the northeast of both countries. Several Brazilian states have gone further. They target the favelas, the very poor neighborhoods, by subsidizing basic foods for customers of small stores. Because better-off Brazilians prefer not to journey into favelas, even for lower prices, the benefits go to those who need them. In Colombia, poverty is scattered throughout the country. So the Government ranked each county according to poverty criteria such as infant mortality and access to health care. Food coupons were distributed to the needy in the 30 percent of counties ranking lowest in these categories.\nSome countries target by subsidizing foods consumed primarily by the poor. In Bangladesh, rice is the preferred grain for those with money; thus, a subsidy on sorghum, which is nutritionally splendid, benefited only those too poor to buy rice. Morocco, which is restructuring its subsidies to emphasize foods eaten by the poor, expects to give the poor greater nutritional benefits for one-fifth the former cost. This year, Mexico established a similar but even larger program than Morocco's, dismantling many of its generalized subsidies.\nTamil Nadu, a state in India, targets a food and nutrition education program in the poorest areas for those at greatest risk. Nutrition workers in 9,000 villages weigh children monthly and provide daily feedings for 90 days to those whose growth is faltering. At the same time, they teach mothers of underweight children how to improve nutrition at home within their means. High-risk pregnant and breast-feeding women also receive food.\nThe benefit of the Tamil Nadu project has been dramatic and enduring. Serious malnutrition has declined by about 50 percent. Two years after children complete the program they are, on average, a significant four pounds heavier than children who did not participate. Sri Lanka is now developing a similar program.\nWhat makes all of these targeted programs so attractive is that they are cost-effective. Food stamps and other broad subsidies often eat up 10 to 20 percent of national budgets. But the new programs get better results at projected costs of only 1 to 2 percent of national budgets, and overall costs are much lower than in conventional approaches. Because these programs provide food only when or where it is most needed, they are less likely to foster a welfare mentality.\nNone of this is to suggest that alleviating the underlying causes of poverty should not remain the most important goal. Education, jobs and access to land are all sorely needed. But the poorest cannot wait. A direct attack on malnutrition is needed as well, and governments willing to make that effort now have effective and affordable measures to make it happen."}, {"text": "BURMA: At a Glance\n1988-07-24T05:00:00.000Z\nEconomy\nDespite fertile farm land, rich teak forests and large deposits of petroleum and precious gems, Burma is among the world's poorest nations. It was once the world's leading rice exporter, but it experienced spot food shortages in 1987. Its economic decline is generally attributed to poor Government management and to a crippling war against several ethnic minorities seeking autonomy. Per capita income is less than $200 a year; firmer estimates are made more difficult by the existence of a vast black market, which is generally considered to be larger than the official economy. Japan and West Germany are major aid donors, and the United States has a modest assistance program, mainly directed at combatting the opium trade. People\nTwo-thirds of the 38 million people are ethnic Burmans. Important minorities include Chinese, Indians, Karens, Shans, Chins and Kachins. Burmese Communists form the largest rebel force; Karens lead the second-largest guerrilla group. The guerrillas have been active since independence in 1948, but riots involving Burmese under the Government's control are a recent phenomenon. About 85 percent of the people are Buddhists. The literacy rate is estimated at 66 percent. Government\nAfter independence from Britain in 1948, Burma had a parliamentary democracy. In 1958, the army chief, Gen. Ne Win, was asked to form a caretaker Government to resolve a political crisis. Elected government was restored in 1960. General Ne Win staged a coup in 1962 and has ruled since then, imposing an isolationist and socialist one-party state. A poorly equipped army of about 160,000 is responsible for internal order and for resisting rebel attacks. Land\nWith 262,000 square miles, Burma is nearly the size of Texas. It shares frontiers with Bangladesh, India, China, Laos and Thailand. Much of the country is mountainous and heavily forested. Most of the agricultural and population centers are clustered along the Irrawaddy River valley and its broad delta. Rangoon, with a population of 3.5 million, is the capital and the largest city. Mandalay, in the heart of the country, is the second-largest city and the center of traditional culture.

The chairman of the Tribal Council of the Seminoles, James E. Billie, perched high above the hull at the controls of the airboat, touched a switch and a beam of light sprang from the band encircling his wide brow.\nMIDNIGHT, a canal near Alligator Alley in the preserve adjacent to Everglades National Park in southern Florida. The chairman of the Tribal Council of the Seminoles, James E. Billie, perched high above the hull at the controls of the airboat, touched a switch and a beam of light sprang from the band encircling his wide brow. He pointed a visitor into a seat in the prow. An airplane engine and propeller contained in concentric steel circles eight feet in diameter formed an imposing backdrop.\n''Hang on and don't let go,'' he warned. In seconds the boat was skimming across the tar-black channel at 45 miles an hour, past literally hundreds of gold-gleaming alligator eyes. Negotiating narrow sloughs, accelerating over sawgrass hummocks, gliding through shallow water, stopping on a dime: Mr. Billie's reputation as an ace pilot of both watercraft and aircraft was not exaggerated. Nor was his skill as a frog catcher.\nZooming alongside each tiny prey, discernible only by the emerald of its eyes, Mr. Billie plucked it from the canal with a flick of the wrist, unerringly pinioning it with a long four-pronged pole, a gig, the frogger's traditional tool.\nFrog hunting is becoming rare in the Everglades, a vanishing wetland that represents the last bastion of the Florida panther (population less than 50) and other endangered species, along with the Seminole Indians (population 1,700), the Independent Seminole (50 to 75 people) and Miccosukee Indians (300).\n''No one can really make a living catching frogs any more,'' Mr. Billie said. ''This is still the only way to get them, one at a time in the middle of the night. It takes too much time and energy and isn't well paid.'' The primary domestic source of edible frogs is the Everglades, but most of the legs consumed in America are imported.\nBeginning in the 1940's real-estate developers, citrus growers, cattle ranchers and produce farmers encouraged the diking and draining of most of Florida's frog country, according to Foster Crippen, owner of the Frogleg Ranch, the major Florida supplier of frogs' legs. ''Compared to cattlemen - sales, profits, net worth - froggers are nothin','' he said.\n''That's the truth. And compared to real estate, we're double nothin'.''\nFrom November through February, when water levels are up in the Southeast, the Frogleg Ranch ships 500 to 2,000 pounds of legs a day, primarily to restaurants in Florida, though some also go to Louisiana, Illinois, Texas, New York, Michigan and California. Frogs' legs are sold in nine sizes, ranging from a hefty two pairs per pound to a minuscule 25, which, Mr. Crippen said, go to Detroit to be deep-fried, bones and all, for sandwiches. In the off-season he ships 100 to 300 pounds a day.\nIf these numbers sound substantial, consider that in the 1930's there were 23 frog farms in southern Florida.\n''And I guess we'll be the last, since we're the only one left,'' said Mr. Crippen, who has been in the business for close to 25 years.\nDr. Dudley Culley, a professor of fisheries at the School of Forestry, Wildlife and Fisheries at Louisiana State University and the author of numerous works on frog farming, said little chance of cultivation exists in the United States, mainly because pesticides have reduced the number of insects, frogs' primary food.\n''Add to that the fact that they are extremely vulnerable to many diseases and that they require live food,'' Dr. Culley said. The situation, however, is not hopeless. Dr. Culley noted: ''Frog people are strange. We get hung up on frogs and can't stop.'' One such dauntless frog person is Bill Seefeldt, owner of Life Cycles Research Company. At his 10-acre ranch in Dade County, Fla., Mr. Seefeldt, a self-taught ''practical geneticist with endless curiosity, not a marketing man,'' raises fish, frogs, turtles, geese, plants, insects and more. Frogs, however, are his true love. ''My first pet in school was a tadpole,'' he explained.\n''Because frogs in captivity present so many breeding problems,'' he continued, ''95 percent of eating frogs are caught in the wild - in Africa, India, Bangladesh, China or the United States.''\nThe Federal Government does not collect any statistics on domestic frog production or consumption. The only figures it collects are on imports. Most of the frog-eating world (West Germany and France are foremost consumers) prefers bullfrogs, but these don't last in the Everglades.\n''They're territorial,'' Mr. Seefeldt explained. ''They just sit and croak in one spot even if it takes a year to find a mate, which makes them perfect edible targets. And they're poorly designed aerodynamically. They have these fat faces. Alligators and snakes nail 'em in a millisecond.'' Through unscientific tastings, Mr. Seefeldt has determined that many Americans love frog meat - it's the idea of the feet they can't stand. So over the last 15 years he has developed a species of meaty, farm-raised albino bullfrogs with small heads and long legs. Mr. Seefeldt plans to have them ready for market by 1990.\nDiners who think of frogs' legs as a specialty of fine French restaurants may be surprised to find that in the Florida national park area they appear in many restaurants that are cozy, down-home, gas-station simple - or just plain ratty. Generally deep-fried, the mild-tasting meat may appear as the ''Everglades Special'' or ''Jumper Plate'' - as at the Coopertown Restaurant, where locals and tourists drop in. More a shack with a lunch counter and tables than a restaurant, the place was built in 1945 at the edge of Highway 41 (the Tamiami Trail), a hot, flat strip where turkey buzzards circle overhead.\nSally Kennon, the owner and cook, receives fresh frogs' legs early each day from her regular froggers. She coats the legs with eggs blended with what she calls her ''secret seasoning mix,'' dips them in bread crumbs, fries them until they turn crunchy, and serves them from 8 A.M. until dark at $6.95 a plate.Nearby, the Miccosukee Village\nRestaurant, an airy coffee shop, features an Everglades Frog Legs Dinner ($10.95) in which the legs are coated in plain flour and fried.\nBy contrast, only a few luxurious restaurants in Miami Beach, Boca Raton and other south Florida cities serve frogs' legs, usually in the classic French style with garlic, or with a few contemporary twists. The Down Under in Fort Lauderdale, for example, for $18 offers a choice of frogs' legs with mushrooms and green peppercorns; with buttery basil sauce atop tomato linguine, or poached, boned, chilled and arrayed on a salad of barley, cucumbers and tomatoes with lemon and cilantro.\nIf the small size of the domestic frog harvest is a problem, importing frogs' legs is an unpredictable business at best, since sources, supplies and prices vary dramatically from season to season. Of the 1,389,734 pounds of fresh, chilled and frozen frogs' legs imported into the United States from January though May this year, 1,261,596 pounds came from Bangladesh. The remainder, in order of volume, came from reshippers in the Netherlands, and from India, Thailand, Indonesia, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.On July 7, however, The Journal of\nCommerce reported that ''Bangladesh, which supplied 76 percent of the delicacy consumed in the United States last year, has joined India and China to ban frog leg exports for the next three years.'' The ban was instituted in May because the Bangladesh insect population had exploded after large numbers of frogs were killed for their legs. Insecticides are costly, as well as toxic to the remaining frogs. Moreover, as nations industrialize, few workers are willing to undertake the laborious job of hunting frogs in the dark for little money.\nDr. Culley of Louisiana State University said he had assisted in the recent establishment of a frog farm in Belem, Brazil that raised 700,000 bullfrogs in 1987. But since frogs' legs are popular among Brazilians, ''There isn't much incentive for the Brazilians to send the frogs out of the country,'' Dr. Culley said. He also noted that the market for frogs to be used in research is more profitable than that for frogs' legs.\nAlthough frozen frogs' legs are still being shipped from warehouses in Bangladesh, they are in short supply.\nPrices have risen, but may not go higher, since the demand in this country is not enough to support such an increase. Those who are fond of frogs' legs, it seems, must either stock up, visit Europe, Asia or the Everglades, or prepare for a dry spell. Fried Frogs' Legs (Adapted from the Miccosukee Village Restaurant) Preparation time: 5 minutes Cooking time: 10 minutes 1 cup vegetable oil 1 cup self-rising flour 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste 1/4 teaspoon ground red pepper, or to taste 1 cup milk 16 pairs frogs' legs, about 2 ounces each. \n1.Heat the oil in a wide skillet or electric skillet to 375 degrees. \n2.Blend together the flour, salt and red pepper in a shallow bowl. Place the milk in a large bowl. Rinse the frogs' legs in water and dry them. Dip into milk, then into flour to coat rather heavily. Place on wax paper. \n3.Slip eight pairs of frogs' legs into the hot oil. Cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Turn and fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes longer. \n4.Transfer to a baking sheet covered with paper towels. Set in a very low oven. Dip, coat and fry the remaining legs. \nYield: 4 servings. Frogs' Legs With Mushrooms, White Wine and Green Peppercorns (Adapted from the Down Under) Preparation time: 1 hour soaking, plus 10 minutes Cooking time: 10 minutes 8 pairs frogs' legs, about 2 to 3 ounces each 1/2 cup milk 2 tablespoons oil 2 tablespoons butter 1/2 pound mushrooms, cut in slices 1/4-inch thick Salt and pepper to taste 2 tablespoons flour mixed with 1/2 teaspoon coarse kosher salt 1 teaspoon drained green peppercorns, crushed with knife blade Y cup dry white wine 1 tablespoon lemon juice. \n1.Soak the frogs' legs in milk 1 hour or more, refrigerated. \n2.Heat 1/2 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter in an 11-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat. Add mushrooms and toss over high heat until golden, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate; add salt and pepper. \n3.Drain and dry the legs thoroughly. Toss four pairs at a time in a paper bag with the flour and salt, until coated well. Tap off the excess. Repeat with the remaining legs. \n4.Add the remaining butter and oil to the pan and melt over moderate heat. Add the frogs' legs (they should fit easily in one layer; if not, divide into two batches). Brown on both sides over moderate heat, 5 to 8 minutes total. Transfer to a serving dish in a warm oven. \n5.Pour any fat from the pan. Add the peppercorns, wine and lemon juice to the pan. Bring to a boil, stirring. Boil until a bit syrupy, or reduced to about 2 tablespoons. Add the mushrooms and toss to heat through. Pour over the legs and serve hot. \nYield: 2 servings. FINDING THEM \nFROGS' legs vary widely in size. For most recipes, allow four pairs of legs, 1 1/2 to 2 ounces each, per serving. Because of the size variation, cooking times may have to be adjusted. For deep-frying, the legs need to swim freely in the oil, which means making adjustments there too.\nAlthough supplies of frogs' legs vary, the stores listed here, all in New York City, report that they often have them. If the legs are frozen, as is usually the case, defrost them in the refrigerator for about 48 hours before rinsing, drying and cooking.\nPisacane Midtown Corporation, 940 First Avenue, between 51st and 52d Streets, telephone 212-355-1850, $7 per pound.\nCatalano's Fresh Fish, 1652 Second Avenue, near 85th Street, 212-628-9608, $8.99 per pound.\nFulton Market Retail Store, 11 Fulton Street, between Front and Beekman Streets, 212-608-2920, $6.95 per pound.\nHung Fish Market, 93 Mulberry Street, off Canal Street, 212-608-1022, sells frogs' legs only on special orders at $24 per 5-pound box.\nDe Martino, 821 Ninth Avenue, between 54th and 55th Streets, 212-265-3813, $5.99 per pound.\nBalducci's, 424 Avenue of the Americas, between Ninth and 10th Streets, 212-673-2600, $11.99 per pound."}, {"text": "DINING OUT; A REWARDING PASSAGE TO INDIA\n1988-02-21T05:00:00.000Z\nA QUICK and delicious passage to India can be made enjoyably at a modest storefront restaurant named Bonani in Stamford.\nNamed for a wooded garden in Bangladesh (the owner's home), Bonani evokes a sense of India, in limited space, through photographs on the pine wainscotted walls, Indian music and especially through the seductive aroma of cumin, cardamom and curry spices wafting from the kitchen.\nThough it began as a take-out shop in Westport (which is still going strong), Bonani has blossomed into a bona fide restaurant with a large menu featuring many chicken, lamb, beef and shrimp variations, and a vegetarian corner. Emphasis is on South Indian cuisine, though there are dishes from across the map of India.\nIf you are a novice at Indian food, you might begin with the assorted Indian hors d'oeuvres, which give you a sampling of pakora (vegetable fritters), samosa (minced meat fritters), kebabs (minced, spiced and tightly pressed beef patties) and spicy pappadams (large crispy wafers).\nAn admirable starter was the chef's special appetizer: pieces of marinated chicken breast in a green pepper-onion sauce enlivened with fresh coriander. Consider also steaming hot mughlai paratha, an oven-browned envelope of dough filled with minced meat, eggs, chopped green pepper and onions. Listed under breads, it makes a generous appetizer as well.\nMost successfully seasoned of many entrees were chicken tikka masala (chunks of marinated breast in an aromatic pale pink yogurt-almond sauce), chicken dhansak (well spiced in a tangy herb sauce with bay leaf), shrimp Madras (jumbo shrimp in a smartly spiced coriander-tomato sauce) and chicken patiala (white meat in a resonant tomato paste). Mattar paneer, a vegetable dish of cheese cubes and peas, had a hint of cardamom and considerable subtlety.\nThe platter of light basmati rice served with entrees is a special treat, seasoned with whole cloves, cardamom, cinnamon and ghee (clarified butter). All three condiments offered as add-ons to the meal were satisfying, from the mild mango chutney to the very hot mango lime pickle. The soothingly cool cucumber raita (a yogurt-based refresher, intended to offset the heat of the various spicy dishes) was a standout.\nLamb vindaloo, one of the most incendiary creations in the Indian repertoire, made with a variety of spices, was mild at Bonani, as though concern for customers' palates led the chef to hold the chilies. We vindaloo lovers were disappointed, though others might find this dish (and the chicken vindaloo) adequately seasoned.\nSome dishes at Bonani were acceptable, but somewhat pale renderings of their usual selves: rogan josh (lamb with tomato, red pepper pods and fresh coriander), shag gosht (lamb with spinach) and aloo-mutter-gobi (a vegetable dish that had only phantom seasoning). A large platter of lamb biryani (rice with lamb and vegetables) was surprisingly characterless, devoid of the nuts and saffron mentioned on the menu and served with a soupy dhal (lentil) sauce and a fiery onion chutney.\nYou should avoid such tepid offerings as the bland, thin mulligatawny soup, with a whisper of lemon but no other semblance to this old Anglo-Indian standby, and the vegetable soup, a similar broth, with the addition of a few peas and cauliflower bits. The pappadams and poori (deep-fried, puffy, crisp bread)had excellent flavor, but were excessively greasy.\nThe mystique of Indian desserts often eludes western tastebuds, but the intention is to have something light, delicate and restful after a hotly seasoned meal. The dessert trio at Bonani filled the bill exactly: rasmalai (cream-soaked Indian cheese), gulab jaman (small, honey-soaked dough balls) and firni (pink custard with rose water).\nThe price at Bonani is certainly right: $25.35 for a three-course dinner for two, with beverages, tax and tip extra. That's hard to beat for a different and, on the whole, satisfying dining adventure. The menu is large enough, with sufficient succulent choices, to make dining at Bonani a rewarding Indian voyage.

It is an Indian socialism, a not strictly orthodox creed woven into the homespun nationalism of Mohandas K. Gandhi. Indian socialism is summarized in the emotive word ''swadeshi'' - ''from our own land'' -and symbolized by the egalitarian costume of white kurta, dhoti and sandals worn from the village well to the halls of power.\nIndian socialism was strengthened and internationalized by British and Indian Fabians and by Communists who shared in the country's struggle for independence and still play a political role today.\nIn foreign policy, Indian socialism has been encouraged by four decades of close association with the Soviet Union, and by involvement in third world organizations espousing nonalignment but often siding with the Soviet bloc against the West.\nWhen neighbors such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh began to accept free-market economic policies (not to mention closer relations with the United States), Indians seemed to become more, not less, convinced of the rightness if not righteousness of their ways.\nWhen an election approaches, politicians say, parties in India often tend to veer back to their nationalist, Indian socialist roots. The rhetoric of self-reliance and self-assuredness - pitched in earthy terms to millions of Indian villagers and cloaked in anti-Americanism for a traditionally left-of-center intellectual elite - wins votes.\nAlready, Kamalapathi Tripathi, a longtime politician of Mr. Gandhi's Congress Party, has made an overture to Indian Communists to bury differences and to join to counter the potential strength of the new middle-of-the-road People's Party, which is still framing its domestic policies, and the larger opposition National Front, to which it belongs.\nHe was rebuffed; the leader of India's Communist Party dismissed Mr. Gandhi as a ''class enemy.'' Indian Communists, in their zeal to upset Mr. Gandhi, are welcoming the formation of an oppositon coalition to the right of them because it would attract more conservative Congress (I) voters while Communists seek to draw off the party's leftists. Criticism From All Sides\nThe main strength of the People's Party -many of whose leaders, including its president, V.P. Singh, a former Finance and Defense Minister, were members of the Congress (I), is that it could offer a viable, broad-based alternative to Mr. Gandhi's Government. Parties of the Marxist left or radical right could not do this and therefore could not bring down the Gandhi Government alone.\nOpposition politicians are now in the process of working out the policies and strategies that they hope will achieve this.\nRajiv Gandhi, who stepped into power within hours of his mother's assassination in 1984 by Sikh members of her bodyguard and then won the election that followed, is being criticized from almost every side these days. But central to much of the discussion is his apparent pragmatic tilt toward the West.\nMr. Gandhi's supporters say that openings to the industrialized world are necessary if India is at last to make the leap into the high technology and large-scale industrial development and raise its standard of living.\nHis critics, pointing to a recent multimillion-dollar deal that will allow Pepsico Inc. to enter the Indian market, accuse the Prime Minister of succumbing to ''economic imperialism,'' selling out the national heritage and endangering domestic industries that will not be able to compete with the soft-drink and food processing plant that it is setting up.\nPepsi is almost certain to be an election issue, with some opposition politicians pledging to abrogate the contract if the Prime Minister is defeated. One of them, George Fernandes, threw Coca-Cola out of India when he was a minister in an opposition Government in 1978.\nBut much has changed in 10 years. Many veterans of the independence generation are gone. Their grandchildren attend American, not British, universities. ''American-returned'' prospective spouses are in demand for a generation accustomed to unisex beauty parlors, discotheques and aerobic dance classes, which came late to India and are regularly excoriated as symbols of decadent foreign influence.\nIn the coming months Indians with new outlooks will be asked to decide who they are and where they want to be led. Decades ago, Nehru, the first Prime Minister, sensed the same searching mood.\n''Sometimes as I reached a gathering, a great roar of welcome would greet me: Bharat Mata ki jai! - Victory to Mother India!'' he wrote in ''Discovering India.''\n''I would ask them unexpectedly what they meant by that cry, who was this Mother India whose victory they wanted? My question would amuse them and surprise them, and then, not knowing exactly what to answer, they would look at each other and at me.''"}, {"text": "Bangladesh Needs Commitment, Not Better Image\n1988-12-07T05:00:00.000Z\nTo the Editor:\nI am writing in response to ''Bangladeshi - and Proud,'' the Nov. 17 Op-Ed article by Fakhruddin Ahmed.\nAs a fellow Bangladeshi, I share his emotion and pride in our Bengali heritage. I also agree with him that ''it is not easy being a Bangladeshi.'' Unfortunately, Mr. Ahmed's ''difficulty'' seems to rise mainly from his perception of the image of Bangladesh abroad, rather than the daily hardships faced by the millions living in poverty in Bangladesh. My pride in my country stems from the struggle of these millions and their love of life, which manifests itself in spite of all the rigors.\nThese are the same people who earned the freedom of Bangladesh from Pakistan through a war of liberation which took the lives of over one million. We Bangladeshis consider this to be a war fought against an occupying power and therefore do not refer to it as a ''civil war,'' as Mr. Ahmed has chosen to do. One should not forget that without this struggle there would be no Bangladesh and hence no cause for national pride.\nBangladesh, situated on the vertex of the Bay of Bengal, bears the wrath of nature in the form of floods and cyclones. True, it is a land of great rivers and great poets and it has a ''fine cuisine,'' but the majority of its population of 110 million has to be content wth meals of salted sticky rice known as pantha bhat. The reason for this large population ''jammed into an area the size of Wisconsin'' is hardly that ''neighboring Indians settled in droves . . . [ and ] stayed put'' in Bengal when it was a part of undivided India. Rather, it is to be found in the poverty and inadequate education that hinders the effective implementation of a population-control program. Population is growing at a rate of 2.4 percent a year and the World Bank projects it to reach 141 million by the year 2000 -an increase of 31 million in 12 years.\nRecent floods in Bangladesh have caused the world to take notice of the difficulties facing our country. The annual floods are directly related to the deforestation of the upstream regions in India and Nepal and the gradual accumulation of silt on the riverbeds in Bangladesh. The need for an effective flood-control program is obvious. But the ability to execute such a program demands sincere commitment.\nSince its independence in 1971, Bangladesh has witnessed many political upheavals, bloody coups, the demise of a secular democratic process and the emergence of the army as the main power broker. The present Government consists of instant politicians from the army and wealthy business communities who lack the technical expertise as well as a basic understanding of people's need.\nIt has also been incapable of challenging neighboring countries, especially India, to shoulder their part of the flood control problem. All these factors combine to make serious commitment difficult. Without grass-roots effort on our part, flood control will be ever elusive. At the same time this effort has to be complemented with international monetary and technical assistance and policy advice on the governmental level.\nMr. Ahmed may fear this request for international assistance to be yet another example of behaving ''as though the world owes us a living.'' I would think that the concern about the lives of 110 million people should surely supersede the concerns about our image. Besides, ths gradual degradation of the global environment is forcing us to realize that the problem of Bangladesh is related to the long-term ecological balance and survival of life, human or otherwise, on this planet. Therefore the problem concerns all humanity.\nBangladesh has borne its share of suffering. The solution is not to wait for a ''few flood-free years'' or for ''our genius'' to make us rebound. The solution lies in our understanding of problems and acceptance of responsibilities. Naturally we take pride in our heritage, but our ''poetry, songs and cuisine'' cannot justify compla-cency.

The Russians refused United Nations mediation. The Afghan guerrillas would not deal with the Soviet-backed Government in Kabul at all and Pakistan, which agreed to represent the insurgents, would not share a negotiating table with it.\nThe innovative Mr. Cordovez, a 52-year-old Ecuadorean lawyer who has worked for the United Nations since 1963, started by talking to each side separately. It was uphill work. Shuttle Diplomacy\nThen he hit on the idea of ''proximity talks'' - putting each side into a separate room and ''shuttling'' back and forth between them, while the United Nations disarmament talks droned on in an intervening conference hall.\nAlthough progress remained slow, there were reasons to laugh. Overzealous guards, told to keep the warring factions apart, regularly locked delegates in the lavatory for fear they might bump into a member of the opposing camp. Mr. Cordovez took to limping through the corridors to signal that his talks were still limping along, despite everything.\nThroughout all the disappointments and frustrations, Mr. Cordovez remained cheerful and persistent, maintaining that what was needed most was time and plenty of it. He was right. It took three years to persuade Kabul to cut the timetable for pulling out Soviet forces from Afghanistan from 43 months to 9.\nEven now, Mr. Cordovez is banking on time, the great healer, to make his agreement a success. The accord provides for Soviet forces to leave Afghanistan but not for the Afghans to stop killing each other.\nBut Mr. Cordovez remains hopeful that once Afghanistan's warring factions see the provocative Russians leave, they will bury their Kalashnikovs and compromise. ''It takes time for them to understand their fate is in their own hands now,'' he said.\nA stylishly dressed, plumpish man with horn-rimmed glasses, Mr. Cordovez is almost always laughing at something, occasionally himself. Enjoys Tinkering\nHe was born in Quito on Nov. 3, 1935; he and his wife, Maria Teresa, have a son, Diego. Mr. Cordovez enjoys carpentry and tinkering (he uses the French word bricolage) with broken things - useful hobbies for a United Nations bureaucrat.\nA lover of good food, wine and Cuban cigars, Mr. Cordovez also enjoys reading biographies of the famous. Not even his closest friends would call him modest.\nMr. Cordovez was appointed an Under Secretary General by Kurt Waldheim a few months before he stepped down as Secretary General.\nIn 1965 he was sent to the Dominican Republic when it was in the throes of revolution. Six years later he was involved in the violent birth of the nation of Bangladesh. In 1980 he was the senior official accompanying a mission to Teheran that failed to resolve the United States Embassy hostage crisis. He had better luck later that year when he helped settle a dispute between Malta and Libya over seabed rights.\nDespite his optimistic temperament, Mr. Cordovez's friends say he suffers occasional fits of gloom.

Since 1980 Bhutan has charged tour companies a fee of $130 per person per day, and a trekking fee of $95 a day. The trekking fee is for those who do not stay in hotels but join hiking and camping tours. Those fees are passed on to tourists who sign up for trips. (Individual travel, for which there is an even higher fee, is rare because making arrangments is difficult.) As of Jan. 1, Bhutan will increase tour-group rates for the peak tourist season - April and October - to $250 a day for tourists and to $130 a day for trekkers. Proportionate increases are to be imposed during the other times of the year. The highest fees coincide roughly with the Paro Festival in the spring and the Thimphu and Wangdiphodrang Festivals in the fall.\nBhutan's government has ''realized they don't have the manpower or the hotels and infrastructure for tourism,'' said Brent Olson of Inner-Asia Expeditions in San Francisco, ''so they want to maintain tourism at the present level, about 2,400 tourists a year, for the next few years.''\nBhutan closed its official tourist agency in the United States a year ago. For information, contact agencies that specialize in Bhutan trips. Two are Inner-Asia Expeditions, 2627 Lombard Street, San Francisco, Calif. 94123 (800-551-1769 or 415-922-0448) and Bhutan Travel, 120 East 56th Street, New York, N.Y. (212-838-6382). Tokyo Exchange Opens for Tours\nThe Tokyo Stock Exchange's new main office building, completed five months ago, is now open to visitors.

There, visitors can use personal computers that simulate the buying and selling of stocks. A robot demonstrates the meaning of the traders' hand signals. And to help visitors understand financial facts Professor Stocks, a mechanical puppet, gives lectures, as a telephone provides English translation. There is also an assortment of videos on the world of trading.\nThe Tokyo Stock Exchange (2-1 Nihombashi, Kaubuto-Cho, Chuo-Ku, Tokyo; 666-0141) is near the Kayaba-Cho station on the Tozai or Hibiya lines or the Edo Bashi station on the Toei-Asakusa line. Visitor's gallery hours are weekdays from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. and Saturdays 9 to 11:30 A.M. Trading sessions are weekdays 9 to 11 A.M. and 1 to 3 P.M. and Saturdays 9 to 11 A,M. The exchange is closed the second and third Saturday of each month, national holidays and the first and last three days of the year. Admission is free. New Air Service To Queensland\nThe number of flights between the United States and Queensland, Australia, will increase this fall as the result an agreement between the United States and Australian Governments. Qantas now hass three flights a week from the West Coast to Cairns. On Nov. 1, Continental will begin three flights a week from San Francisco and two from Los Angeles to Cairns and on to Brisbane. United will offer flights to the two cities sometime in early 1989.\nCairns, in tropical northern Australia and near the Great Barrier Reef, has become increasingly popular with American travelers in the last few years, according to the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation.\nIn return for granting the new flights, Qantas will be allowed to fly into new cities in the United States, to be chosen later this year.\nRound-trip coach fares for the Continental flights will be $1,195 during November, according to the airline. On Dec. 1 the fare will increase to $1,395. Meeting in Asia: A Greeting Guide\nWhile a handshake is acceptable on being introduced to a resident of most Asian cities, other forms of greeting may be customary. Also, there are often may be prohibitions about men shaking hands with women. In general, do not greet someone by his or her first name until you are so addressed. Some other guidelines follow.\nAustralia: Women do not usually shake hands with other women. Friends or acquaintances seen at a distance are greeted with a wave.\nBangladesh: When introduced to a man it is customary to shake hands; when introduced to a woman, nod and greet with words.\nChina: A slight bow or handshake is customary. Chinese use the full title of a guest during introductions.\nFiji: Fijians greet each other with a smile and raised eyebrows, but a handshake is acceptable.\nHong Kong: Handshakes are common. Family members are greeted in order of age, oldest to youngest. Titles are used in introductions.\nIndia: Men and women do not usually shake hands with one another. Common greeting for all is to place palms together at chin level and bow slightly, and say, to Hindus, ''namaste'' (pronounced na-mas-TAY) or ''namaskar'' (na-mas-CAR) and to Moslems, ''salaam aleikum.''\nIndonesia: Handshakes customary only on first introduction or when someone leaves on a long journey or returns from one. A hand placed on one's heart while shaking hands means the person greeted is very special.\nJapan: Bow for formal greeting, nod for informal greeting.\nThe Philippines: Men should wait for Filipino women to extend their hands. Men may also pat one another on the back.\nSouth Korea: Men greet each other by bowing slightly and shaking hands with both hands or the right hand. Women do not usually shake hands. A younger person greets the older first.\nTahiti: Tahitians usually kiss each other on the cheek when meeting.\nTaiwan: Handshakes customary only for males who are acquaintances or close friends. On first aquaintance a nod or slight bow is appropriate.\nThailand: Place hands together in a prayer position at the chest, bow head to touch index fingers and say ''Sawadee'' (pronounced sah-wah-DEE). Younger person greets the older first. U.S. Warnings On Travel to Asia\nHere are summaries of travel advisories issued by the State Department for Americans considering a visit to Asia.

Admission is $4.50."}, {"text": "Trade Bill Has Special Favors For Companies\n1988-04-11T05:00:00.000Z\nBuried deep in the 1,000-page trade bill that Congress is trying to complete this week are provisions benefiting companies making everything from drugs and disposable diapers to cooking ware and frozen cranberries.\nThese special provisions have created a powerful constituency behind the bill, even as debate continues over other, more controversial aspects of the legislation.\nHard bargaining is expected this week between the White House and Congress, with President Reagan setting the stage by reiterating his veto threat in his radio address Saturday, asserting, ''I will veto a bad trade bill before I let a bad trade bill veto our economy.''\nThe greatest benefit, potentially worth more than $100 million, would go to the Warner-Lambert Company. A provision deftly inserted by its lobbyists would extend for three and a half years its patent on a cholesterol-reducing drug called Lopid.\nThe patent is due to expire in July 1989, at which time the company would face competition from generic producers, which, with approval from the Food and Drug Administration, would be free to sell a similar drug at lower prices.\nNow prescribed only for people suffering from inflammation of the pancreas, Lopid is Warner-Lambert's third-largest-selling drug, and the company is seeking F.D.A. approval for its wider use. Lopid sales last year were $101 million, up 74 percent over the year before.\nHundreds of other companies would also benefit, chiefly from miscellaneous tariff reductions that have been tacked onto the legislation in the more than two years of its gestation. Among these are the Procter & Gamble Company, which would get cheaper sodium polyacrylate polymers, a moisture-absorbing chemical, for use in superabsorbent disposable diapers; Corning Glass Works, which would have duties suspended on its Visions cookware imported from plants abroad, and Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc., which would be able to import frozen cranberries from Canada duty-free. White House Objections\nIt would all come to naught, however, with a Presidential veto, assuming it is not overridden. The White House objects not to the special-interest sections of the bill, but to broader proposals affecting the economy at large.\nThe main targets are proposals to force companies to give at least 60 days' notice of impending plant closings, to require disclosure of sensitive foreign investment information and to limit Presidential flexibility in some trade decisions.\nThe President's advisers may urge that he sign the bill if these proposals are eliminated or modified, Administration officials said.\nTreasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d and Clayton K. Yeutter, the United States trade representative, are expected to meet with the Democratic Congressional leadership early this week to try to lay the framework for compromise. Unresolved Issues\nHouse and Senate negotiators came to a series of agreements on March 31, just before the Easter recess, but there are some unresolved issues -chiefly relating to investment and agriculture - likely to be taken up early this week.\nMany provisions of this sweeping legislation, only the second trade bill this decade, would produce changes that would affect the nation's overall posture in trade and competitiveness.\nBut the impact would not be felt until well into a new Administration, when new cases are brought by companies seeking protection against imports, or complaining about unfair foreign trade practices.\nOn the other hand, patent extension and tariff suspension have practical effects that make the bill a point of considerable immediate interest in many board rooms. Where Consumers Could Suffer\nSome tariff-cutting benefits could be passed on to consumers in lower prices, Congressional aides pointed out. But the most controversial of the special-interest provisions, the Lopid patent extension, could work against the consumer by denying the benefits of a cheaper generic equivalent.\nWarner-Lambert's president and chief executive, Joseph D. Williams, a former president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, personally managed the intensive lobbying effort, a sign of how important the issue is to his company.\nOne major victory was getting the patent extension attached to the bill. Usually this kind of legislation stands on its own and might be subject to intense scrutiny. But there were no public hearings before the Lopid provision was added to the omnibus bill last June. The risk in this strategy lies in the veto threat.\n''There is a certain internal logic in making this a part of the trade bill, since this is an industry very much involved in U.S. trade,'' said Edward S. Knight, the company's legislative counsel and a partner in the Washington law firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld.\n''The pharmaceutical industry makes a positive contribution of $800 million to the balance of trade,'' he stressed. ''Companies in France, Germany and Japan are in the process of developing and marketing drugs that would compete against Lopid.''\nThe chief House sponsor of the extension was Representative Butler Derrick, Democrat of South Carolina, who has a big Warner-Lambert plant in his state. Spirited Opposition\nBut there was spirited opposition, chiefly from Representative Robert W. Kastenmeier, Democrat of Wisconsin, chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties and the Administration of Justice, who did not like the idea of special-interest provisions in a trade bill.\nAlso weighing in against the patent extension was Eric Hard, a staff attorney for Public Citizens' Congress Watch, a public-interest watchdog group, who argued that the losers would be ''America's poor, sick and elderly, as well as the taxpayers, through Medicare and Medicaid'' -Government programs that pay for drugs for the elderly and poor.\nA month's supply of Lopid costs anywhere from $40 to $70 in drugstores. ''If a person on a fixed income is prescribed three or four such drugs,'' Mr. Hard said, ''the dilemma is readily apparent.''\nOther provisions of the bill were intended to give added tariff protection to specific companies, such as the Smith Corona Corporation, the only surviving American producer of portable electric typewriters in American.\nSmith Corona has long complained about what it contends is the ''dumping'' of Japanese typewriters at unfairly low prices in the United States, and in 1979 won an order imposing higher duties on the Japanese products.\nBut the Japanese added calculating and memory features to their typewriters, thus changing the product classification to one not covered by the dumping order.\nThe Smith Corona provision, sponsored by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, would help Smith Corona, which manufactures in Cortland, N.Y., obtain dumping duties against ''later-developed typewriters.''\nBut most changes involve tariff suspensions to help a domestic industry dependent on materials not made in this country. Gumball Trinkets\nOne of the largest price reductions could come on gumball-machine trinkets. Tariffs on the jewelry and small toys wrapped in the plastic balls had been levied at up to 30 percent of the import price of the product itself. That duty would end. Before the gumball provision was added to the bill, one Senate aide noted, it had to be established that these products are made only outside the United States, in such countries as China, Taiwan and Bangladesh."}, {"text": "Corrections\n1988-09-30T05:00:00.000Z\nAn article on Sept. 8 about the aftermath of floods in Bangladesh misidentified the language in which ''pani'' means water. The word exists in Hindi and Urdu."}, {"text": "Photographs That Reflect and Confront Cultural Icons\n1988-01-29T05:00:00.000Z\nJUDGED by its first month, 1988 promises to be an energetic, expansive and sometimes controversial year for photography. On a weekend's excursion to museums and galleries currently exhibiting photographs, one can sense a ferment that compensates for the often uninviting chill of winter streets and sidewalks.\nIf the shows now on view are any indication, the biggest issue to be faced this year hinges on how we look at photographs. Do they wear their meanings on their sleeves, or are they signs of half-hidden attitudes and biases? The sharpest delineation of this question can be found in the exhibition ''Picturing 'Greatness' '' at the Museum of Modern Art. Part of the museum's ''Contemporary Art in Context'' program, the show consists of 39 portrait photographs of artists, selected from the museum's photography collection by the artist Barbara Kruger.\nGiven Ms. Kruger's post-modernist reputation and the nature of her artworks - declarative, billboard-size photomontages that intend to upset the status quo - a collaboration between her and the museum's generally conservative department of photography would seem unlikely. But the result is a huge success. For the museum's audience, it offers a chance to see firsthand how a new generation of artists and critics is responding to photographs as cultural evidence. For the museum's photography department, it marks what one hopes is a new era of openness and experimentation.\n''Picturing 'Greatness' '' is a show about the ways in which artists of this century have presented themselves to the camera, and the ways in which photographers have chosen to depict them. Although Ms. Kruger does not bother to sort out whether photographers or their subjects are more responsible for the images that are presented, her essential point is well taken: the idea of ''the artist'' is, in pictorial terms, a virtual cliche. The ''look'' of being an artist is predetermined by cultural precedent. The art-ists on view range from Claude Monet to Jackson Pollock, and in appearance they vary from ''a kind of well-tailored gentility,'' in Ms. Kruger's words, to ''a kooky middleman between God and public.'' Many of the pictures are well known, including the show's most obvious cliche, Edward Steichen's print of Rodin posed as a mirror of his sculpture ''The Thinker.'' But others are sufficiently individual as to seem fresh, including a 1935 image of Alexander Rodchenko, thought to be a self-portrait, and Irving Penn's 1947 portrait of John Marin, imperiously leaning on a umbrella.\nBut the intent of the exhibition is not to present these images as individual works of art. This is made obvious by the installation itself, which differs radically from usual museum practice. Ms. Kruger has hung the prints in groups, stacking some like totem poles, to point out certain motifs. In one group, all the artists are holding cigarettes; in another, they are all wielding brushes. And then there is the show's wall label, which dominates the center of the gallery. It greatly resembles one of Ms. Kruger's own artworks, with bands of red paint flanking type so big it can be read from outside the gallery.\nWhat Ms. Kruger has done, in short, is to make obvious the curator's intention and intervention. She also has expanded the context of the photographs so that they are ''about'' more than just the history and esthetics of photography itself. For this we have to thank the artist and Susan Kismaric, the photography curator who invited her to put together the show.\n''Picturing 'Greatness' '' remains at the Museum of Modern Art through March 29. ''The Logic of Display'' P. S. 1 46-01 21st Street Long Island City, Queens Through March 6\nWhile less emphatic about revealing the hand of the curator than ''Picturing 'Greatness,' '' the group exhibition ''The Logic of Display'' at P. S. 1 suggests that the urge to link photography with larger cultural forces is a widespread, even international phenomenon. Consisting of work by 10 artists from four countries, the exhibition makes the point that photographic images are increasingly being used in hybrid works that resemble sculpture more than traditional photographs. But that's only part of the purpose of the show, which was organized by two P. S. 1 curators, Paul Laster and Renee Riccardo. The less obvious, more telling message is that artists are ''packaging'' their photographs in ways that refer to, and comment on, commercial precedents.\nBarbara Bloom's ''Arena,'' for example, is a glass-fronted showcase that holds photographs and a shoe. The images depict a sports stadium and a shoe store that is designed like a stadium. On another wall, a group of French artists who call themselves Information Fiction Publicite show a series of four light boxes, arrayed from floor to ceiling, that look like miniaturized bus-shelter advertising panels. But in this case, the backlit ''ads'' are merely images of clouds.\nThe most intriguing piece in the show, however, may have more to do with architecture than packaging. By an artist known as B. Wurtz, it consists of an empty amplifier case, on which is mounted a cylindrical chair leg, and two photographs. The photos seem to show us industrial factory buildings, but close examination reveals them to be close-up, worm's-eye views of the assemblage on the floor.\nAlso at P. S. 1 is a fascinating exhibition of work by the Swiss artists Peter Fischli and David Weiss and an intriguing slide installation by Richard Baim. The Fischli and Weiss show, organized by Karen Marta for the List Visual Arts Center of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, features humorous photographs of their unlikely, Rube Goldberg-style constructions and a video projection of their masterpiece to date, a film called ''Der Lauf der Dinge'' (loosely, ''How Things Work''). Using elemental means - fire and fireworks, blasts of air, gravity and a variety of corrosive liquids - the artists manage to sustain a chain reaction of ever-more-absurd materials and events for 30 minutes.\nMr. Baim's installation, called ''World/Fair,'' uses the techniques of corporate slide presentation, including computer-controlled dissolves and lighting effects, to undercut the implicit promise of progress they contain. Images of ''modern'' society - highways, factories and buildings - merge and blend in sometimes revelatory, sometimes unfathomable ways. Their slow procession, seen over a monument bearing an optimistic message about a ''brave new world,'' gives the installation a seriousness and gravity unusual in today's art world. 'No Trumpets, No Swans' Pratt Manhattan Gallery Puck Building 295 Lafayette Street Through Feb. 24\nA far more jaundiced view of contemporary art photography than the P. S. 1 shows - indeed, an oppositional one - can be found in the exhibition ''No Trumpets, No Swans,'' at the Pratt Manhattan Gallery. Organized by Philip Perkis, who teaches photography at Pratt Institute, with Eleanor Moretta, the gallery's exhibitions director, ''No Trumpets, No Swans'' aims to rehabilitate the practice of what's called ''street photography'' from what Mr. Perkis clearly feels is its currently unfashionable position in the art world.\nAlthough situated geographically on the edge of SoHo, ''No Trumpets'' is situated against it esthetically. The eight photographers in the show seem less interested in issues of representation and packaging than in reporting on fleeting facts of the visible world. In an argumentative statement available at the gallery, the critics Marvin Hoshino and Roberta Hellman say that these pictures challenge ''the common notion that straight camera work is somehow limiting, that it's come to a dead end and is not contemporary.''\nThe evidence gathered here includes Helen Levitt images dating to 1942 and Garry Winogrand pictures from the 60's together with much recent photography, including Mr. Perkis's. The pictures indeed show that the pleasures of straightforward, uninflected photography remain as strong as ever. Photographs such as Elaine Mayes's image of a boy flattened against his skateboard, and Judy Linn's Coney Island view, in which a young woman's shoulder merges magically with the horizon behind her, seem marvelous no matter what one calls them. But it remains to be seen whether the incidental beauty of images like these is enough to displace the current trend toward more elaborated, skeptical uses of photography. (After closing in Manhattan, the show will reopen at the Rubelle and Norman Schafler Gallery, Pratt Institute, 200 Willoughby Avenue, in Brooklyn, March 4 to 31.) 'Marc Riboud: Lasting Moments, 1953-1988' I.C.P.-Midtown Gallery 77 West 45th Street Through March 12\nThe ''hidden hand'' tradition of ''No Trumpets, No Swans'' is by no means limited to the eight photographers represented in that show, of course. It can also be seen at the I.C.P.-Midtown Gallery, in an endearing retrospective of the work of the French photographer Marc Riboud. Mr. Riboud's output of the last 35 years serves as a reminder of Henri Cartier-Bresson's vast influence on postwar photography. While never a slavish imitator of Cartier-Bresson's style, Mr. Riboud does share the master's reliance on intuition and devotion to lyrical moments. What distinguishes his work is its obvious sympathy with peasants, laborers, refugees and common people generally.\nCompared to Cartier-Bresson, whose work can be seen in the show ''Henri Cartier-Bresson in India,'' at the International Center of Photography (1130 Fifth Avenue, at 94th Street, through Feb. 28), Mr. Riboud seems to function on the sidelines of world events. He portrays strife in Bangladesh through the faces of grieving young widows, the Vietnam antiwar movement by juxtaposing a flower and a bayonet. Although he has called himself a poor reporter because of this, his knack for recording history from the viewpoint of those most affected by it gives his pictures their unique and often compelling personality. Robert Rauschenberg Pace/MacGill Gallery 11 East 57th Street Through March 5\nRobert Rauschenberg's new photographs, taken with a large-format Polaroid camera and displayed at the Pace/MacGill Gallery, are something else entirely from Marc Riboud's work. Rather than report on the world, they record the omnivorous vision of their maker. The photographs fall into two groups. Those in black and white, showing us bits of cars, bicycles and palm trees, are bleached and stained and sometimes grouped into grids of four. The color images are straightforward, almost documentary observations of fading signs, peeling plywood and other forms of material dereliction.\nPhotography is nothing new to Rauschenberg, who started taking pictures at Black Mountain College in 1949. The idea of claiming for art items that were bound for the junkyard is not new either - witness his show of ''Glut'' sculptures at Blum Helman Gallery (20 West 57th Street, through tomorrow). What is of interest, though, is the way these pictures make clear his penchant for decay.\nThere are, however, two problems here. One is that the pictures seem to have a touch of deja vu. The black-and-whites have the look of earlier Rauschenberg prints, perhaps mixed with a touch of the Starn Twins; the color is reminiscent of William Eggleston's work. The other is that the artist's perceptive facility is so great there seems to be no end to its expression. By using a camera - that mechanical producer of endless images - Rauschenberg doubles the odds of visual surfeit."}, {"text": "THE NOTORIOUS UNKNOWN INDIAN\n1988-11-13T05:00:00.000Z\nTHY HAND, GREAT ANARCH! India: 1921-1952. By Nirad C. Chaudhuri. 979 pp. Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley Publishing Company. $29.95.\nOn his wedding night, Nirad Chaudhuri, a man in his early 30's, sat beside his bride for the first time. He was in a state of high anxiety, but not because his previous sexual experiences had amounted only to gazing from afar at a young woman in a nearby house and studiously reading the classics of French pornography. What he was worried about was whether his new wife would permit him to pursue his passion for phonograph recordings of European classical music. Carefully he broached the subject: Could she spell ''Beethoven''? To his great relief she slowly responded: ''B,E,E,T,H,O,V,E,N.''\nNirad Chaudhuri is a fiction created by the Indian writer of the same name - a bizarre, outrageous and magical transformation of that stock character of imperialist literature, the Bengali Babu. Ever since Mr. Chaudhuri failed his M.A. examination in history at Calcutta University and threw over a secure post as clerk in the military accounts department, he has devoted himself to responding to the notion that Indians could not be truly learned in the civilization of Europe. As a man of culture - not, as he would put it, in the anthropological sense - he would beat the British at their own game.\nNow 91 years old and living in Oxford, England, Mr. Chaudhuri has written this monstrously long memoir - ''Thy Hand, Great Anarch!'' - as a way to settle scores not only with the British, but with India's nationalist leaders, that is, with those who opposed and finally defeated the Westernization of Indian civilization. He sees himself as the last survivor of the so-called Bengal Renaissance, the vital and creative cultural movement that was initiated by Ram Mohan Roy (c. 1774-1833) and that came to an end with the death of Rabindranath Tagore in 1941.\nAccording to Mr. Chaudhuri, the Bengali Hindu gentry lost their rightful role as the political and cultural leaders of modern India, partly as a result of their own moral limitations, but mostly because of a combination of British racism and the rise of democratic politics. To reverse the old colonial cliche, British imperialism was a fine thing except for the British, for they continually opposed the efforts of Indians to participate in the European way of life. But the real villains, the author says, were Nehru and especially Gandhi, who threw over the opportunity of their youthful experience in England to deny all that could have revitalized India.\nMr. Chaudhuri didn't have the advantages of India's leaders. Born in 1897, his knowledge of things European came almost entirely from the Imperial Library in Calcutta or from books purchased at great personal sacrifice. In 1942, with Tagore dead, with the Japanese just east of Bengal and the political leadership of Bengali Hindus eclipsed by Bengal's Muslim majority and, at the national level, by non-Bengalis like Gandhi and Nehru, Mr. Chaudhuri said his goodbye to all that and left Bengal. ''My people had no future,'' he decided, ''and I was not prepared to share their fate.''\nFor the previous five years he had been private secretary to an important leader of the Indian National Congress, Sarat Chandra Bose, whose younger brother, Subhas, drummed out of the Congress, had joined the Axis powers as leader of the Indian National Army. Always pro-British - Churchill, the fiercest antagonist of Indian nationalism, was his political hero - Mr. Chaudhuri accepted a position as a writer of propaganda (frankly so called in those days) for the Government broadcasting system in Delhi. In his previous career as a freelance journalist, editor and radio commentator, he had written in both Bengali and English; now he virtually gave up Bengali and along with it much of the Bengali style of living. For the first time in his life, he adopted English clothing, of course of the best material and cut. He also made the supreme sacrifice and started eating English-style food, having come to the conclusion that ''good English cannot be written on [ an Indian ] diet.''\nIn 1947, Mr. Chaudhuri set out to write ''The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian.'' That was also the year of India's independence and partition. Bengal was divided, with Mr. Chaudhuri's birthplace in what is now Bangladesh. His memoir follows the pattern of much Bengali fiction. There is a sensitive and lyrical description of early childhood and education in the rural heartland of Bengal, followed by an account of a painful uprooting to the city of Calcutta; in the end, the hero is cast adrift in tragic isolation - all this a romantic echo of the classical Hindu stages of life.\nThe ''Autobiography'' took Mr. Chaudhuri's life story and his account of India's modern development to 1921. ''Thy Hand, Great Anarch!'' is the continuation, ending the story in 1952 with the publication (in 1951) and reception of that first book. It was only three years later that Mr. Chaudhuri got to travel to his beloved Europe (the account of that brief trip is his best book, ''A Passage to England''). In 1970, thanks to the personal patronage of the American sociologist Edward Shils, he settled down in England, never to return to India.\nThe reception of ''The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian'' invalidated its title. Mr. Chaudhuri became notorious, celebrated in England and the United States, denounced in India. In his first book he had declared himself a failure, but here, for all his bitterness, the protagonist is characterized by immense self-satisfaction.\nMr. Chaudhuri deliberately had the ''Autobiography'' and most of his subsequent books published initially in England, on the grounds that only then would they receive attention in India. In ''Thy Hand, Great Anarch!'' he portrays himself as ''a Cassandra, giving warnings of calamities to come.'' It is only out of frustration that he has accepted the more comfortable role of shoring up the ethnocentric self-confidence of Westerners by debunking India. ''Even now my countrymen have not learnt to be afraid of me, and pay no heed to what I write.'' It is sad but understandable that Mr. Chaudhuri prefers what he calls ''my literary standing in the English speaking world.''\nThis book's title, derived from Alexander Pope's ringing conclusion to the ''Dunciad,'' announces the author's bitter satirical purpose, for he depicts both modern India and the modern world as mired in a reign of chaos. The subtitle, ''India: 1921-1952,'' makes the book sound like a history, and indeed much of it is made up of lengthy historical essays or high-flown disquisitions about the rise and fall of civilizations.\nAs a historian Mr. Chaudhuri is useful insofar as he recounts personal experience - for example, his accounts of the Bose brothers or of Hindu-Muslim riots at the time of partition. But much of the history in this book is second-hand at best. Great cascades of flowery erudition, allusions to the histories of ancient Greece and endless quotations of French poetry are of interest mostly as evidence of Mr. Chaudhuri's artfully constructed persona. Indeed, he points out the hollowness of the whole enterprise as a work of scholarship by saying at the outset that a history of the period cannot be written, since all the documents are false and all historians ignorant or dishonest. And only he is left to tell the tale. But he also says that the tale is not worth telling, that nothing was achieved by all the political events of the period, that Gandhi had nothing to do with the departure of the British, that the British left out of sheer exhaustion at the hands of Hitler. If one were to ask how he can know what he claims to know, the history would vanish into air. A good editor would have removed most of it.\nBut people have said the same thing about ''War and Peace.'' Although Mr. Chaudhuri may not be what Saul Bellow would call the Tolstoy of the Bengalis, he may remind many readers of Nabokov's Pnin."}, {"text": "BARTER IS HIS STOCK IN TRADE\n1988-09-25T05:00:00.000Z\nIN THE FALL OF 1986, W. DOUGLASS LEE Jr., an American commodities trader based in London, received a call for help from a representative of a major chemical producer. The United States multinational corporation had sold $8 million in chemicals to Zimbabwe and had agreed to take payment in tobacco rather than cash. The company had resold the tobacco to Egypt and, in the process, had negotiated a $12 million chemicals sale as well. In lieu of cash, Egypt was offering in payment for both deals a shopping list of commodities ranging from pig iron to rice and coriander.\nSoon afterward, Lee was on a red-eye flight from London's Heathrow Airport to Cairo, arriving at 4 A.M. on a Monday in November to begin long rounds of negotiations with senior government officials and top executives of Egypt's state-owned enterprises. His mission: to insure that $20 million in hard currency wound up in the company's coffers.\nThe first trickle of goods traded for cash finally came out of Egypt last February: Lee peddled Egyptian aluminum to a British manufacturer, Egyptian pig iron in Italy and Bangladesh. Sales of Egyptian steel to the Far East are still pending. But the route to obtaining the cash for the chemical company was arduous and littered with obstacles. Over the past 22 months, for instance, Lee has become intimately familiar with Egyptian metals factories, personally inspecting manufacturing methods and quality control and working out the details of product specifications, delivery schedules and pricing contracts.\nThe negotiating etiquette required lengthy meetings refreshed by rounds of the muddy, nerve-jolting coffee favored by the Egyptians and long talks over late dinners, ending, Lee recalls, ''about 2 A.M. after the belly dancers and everything else.'' There were even political delays, such as the cabinet reshuffle that came the night before Lee was scheduled to have a crucial meeting with Egypt's trade minister, who was ousted in the government shake-up.\n''It rarely goes smoothly,'' says Lee, a 40-year-old expatriate who has made his home in England for the last 15 years. ''But when you're successful, the country has a new market for its goods and your client makes its sale and gets its cash.''\nDOUGLASS LEE IS ONE OF A NEW BREED OF FREELANCE middlemen who operate on the cutting edge of world trade - the shadowy but expanding niche known as countertrade. In the 1980's, a growing number of American industrial and financial giants such as General Motors, Dow Chemical and American Express have been engaging in the controversial practice, often with the assistance of experts like Lee.\nIn its broadest sense, the term covers all international trade in which payment is in some form other than cash. A more sophisticated version of barter, the world's oldest form of commerce, countertrade encompasses basic swaps of goods for goods, but also goods for technology, goods for services and even goods for debt.\nCountertrade deals such as Lee's three-legged United States-Zimbabwe-Egypt exchange, starting with chemicals and moving through agricultural products and metals to hard currency, are crafted mainly between Western corporations and the world's least creditworthy big customers, the nations of the Eastern bloc and the third world.\nEastern European governments spawned the international countertrade business in the 50's. Communist bureaucrats wanted advanced machinery and factories for postwar development but, lacking sufficient foreign currency, forced Western exporters to accept some of the payment in goods. They still do. Developing countries have been pushed to countertrade by the debt crunch. With foreign loans scarce, they trade goods to buy necessary imports and new technology.\nOnce shunned by the United States Government and most corporations, countertrade is being reappraised as a tool to open up untapped markets for American products and to help trim the massive trade deficit. ''Countertrade is everywhere now,'' says Leo G. B. Welt, a Washington-based international trade consultant. ''Countries and corporations are increasingly using countertrade as a marketing tool. It gives you a vehicle for doing business when, otherwise, there would be no business.''\nEstimates of the size of this gray area of world trade range from 8 percent to more than 25 percent, depending on definition and method of calculation. More than 60 governments now encourage countertrade, including such major developing markets as China, India and Brazil. Indonesia has made countertrade mandatory on most government import contracts. Peru has elected goods-for-debt transactions as the main vehicle for paying off its $6 billion in foreign bank loans. As a result, British and American financial institutions, including Chase Manhattan, First Interstate of California and American Express, are scrambling to find buyers for everything from Peruvian fish meal to Peruvian vacations.\nStill, countertrade is frowned upon by global organizations such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the International Monetary Fund. Critics argue that countertrade is not only economically inefficient but also a convenient cover for unfair trade practices and graft.\n''COUNTERTRADE IS A WORLD for the lateral thinker, the innovative entrepreneur, the unconventional businessman,'' says Gilbert Nockles, trade finance director of the countertrade unit of Britain's Midland Bank, a leader among banks in the field. It seems an ideal milieu for a freelance operator like Doug Lee, bearded, informal and quick-witted.\nThe son of a General Electric Company executive who served as an assistant secretary in the Commerce Department during the Nixon Administration, Lee was born in Salem, Mass., and reared in cities on the Eastern seaboard - ''a different one every three years,'' he says - before attending DePauw University in Greencastle, Ind. He graduated in 1970, after spending his junior year at the London School of Economics.\nRecalling that turbulent era, Lee says he did not want ''to grow up in a corporate structure, as I saw my father do.'' If life as an organization man did not appeal to him, he quickly admits, neither did he want ''to end up in my 30's in some pensione in Italy or Spain with nothing.''\nBecoming a commodities trader appeared to offer a lucrative middle ground. He traded metals in New York for three years but realized that London, the hub of the international metals market, was the place to be. Over the next 12 years, Lee worked for several British trading houses, building a network of contacts.\nHis social circle extended far beyond the trading rooms. In the 70's, his apartment in Chelsea served as a gathering spot for writers, artists and rock musicians with origins in the counterculture and anti-Vietnam War movement.\nLee came to countertrade by the traditional route, metals trading. Many of the big countertrading houses, such as West Germany's Metallgesellschaft A.G., Austria's Allgemeine Waren-Treuhand Aktiengesellschaft and Philipp Brothers of New York, got into the business through trading and financing metals deals with Eastern bloc nations.\nHe acquired his first taste of countertrade four years ago, when Rumania offered aluminum coil in payment for tungsten trioxide. Rumania, like many Eastern European nations, did not have the international marketing organization to handle the sale itself. Thereafter, Lee became increasingly interested in countertrade, finding the intricate fashioning of deals more stimulating than the frenetic daily grind of metals trading. Countertrade also presented an entrepreneurial opportunity. In 1985, Lee began working for himself full time, having set up Intertech Resources Ltd. earlier, to handle a few consulting jobs. The business grew slowly, with Lee straining to keep ahead of the American Express bills.\nCountertrade is not a get-rich-quick business like commodities trading, Lee says, nor is it as treacherous. He describes it as a service business for which he collects fees without investing his own capital. The risk is in the possibility of the deal's collapsing. Deals require ''front-end loading'' in time and energy, he says, and have to be nurtured. But once they get going, they tend to be rolled over, and generate a steady stream of revenue.\nCurrently, Lee has a handful of clients, including Dow Chemical, Rank Xerox, Continental Tire and the countertrade arm of Chase Manhattan. Adhering to the unwritten code of confidentiality that governs the business, he will not name the companies that are involved in his deals.\nAlthough he still trades metals, most of his efforts these days are bent toward countertrade. This year he figures Intertech will handle deals valued at $25 million on which he will collect fees of 1 to 10 percent, although usually toward the lower end of that range.\nTo cope with the increased business, last spring Lee hired two experienced traders, Gordon Davidson, a metals specialist with aviation expertise, and Yvonne Tallantire, a dealer in so-called soft commodities. Tallantire has been involved in trading chemicals in China for frozen vegetables. Intertech Resources markets the snow peas, water chestnuts and mushrooms to such European food companies as pizza chains.\nIntertech Resources occupies an unpretentious office on the fifth floor of a converted Victorian residence overlooking Hanover Square in London's fashionable West End. The building's antique cage elevator is shielded from replacement by a historic preservation order. Riding it is the slowest-moving minute and a half in Lee's day. For countertraders, work is usually a matter of juggling several marathon deals at once, keeping in touch with locations spread across a series of continents and time zones by means of telephone, telex and facsimile machine. Frequent travel is a given. To Lee, airports are a second home. He flew 200 times last year, logging 200,000 miles, the equivalent of circling the globe eight times. ''My travel agent loves me,'' Lee says. ''He calls me up for advice.'' Lee travels mostly to places like Bucharest, Skopje, Zagreb and Guangzhou, a far cry from the luxury hotels and Michelin-starred restaurants of the international business circuit. He has learned to welcome the sight of lizards scurrying up the walls of a hotel room in provincial India or China because, he says, ''they're working for you, eating the insects.''\nIn Rumania, Lee never conducts business in his hotel room; he is sure it is bugged. On more than one occasion, he has been tailed. He was roughed up during a left-wing demonstration in Istanbul, and some third world taxi drivers have come close to transporting him off a cliff.\nCorporate clients, even those with in-house countertrade units, hire Lee for his technical expertise and his useful contacts. As a freelance operator, he can sometimes move more easily and wheel and deal a bit more than an employee of a large corporation. ''It doesn't matter what bizarre commodity you hit him with, Lee either knows people who can handle it or he can find them in a few hours,'' says Michael Shaddick, an Australia-based countertrade specialist, who has dealt with Lee. ''He has the contacts to get the deal done.''\nKey officials in the national and regional foreign trade organizations of the Soviet bloc know Lee; they answer his telexes and take his telephone calls. ''It's all very personal and there's no replacing the face-to-face contact,'' he says.\nThus, at times, Lee can put together a deal where others fail or get a shipment into or out of a country that a company could not arrange on its own. Last spring, he was called in to rescue a countertrade in Yugoslavia. A major European tire maker had agreed to take payment for tires in the form of zinc oxide, which can be used in tire production. The arrangement was 500 tons of zinc oxide for each shipment of 30,000 tires. ''I was brought in after the deal was signed,'' Lee recalls. ''The meter was running, but no one had ever thought about the packaging problem.'' The tire manufacturer's machinery was made for grappling efficiently with zinc oxide in one-ton polypropylene ''supersacks.'' The Yugoslavian regional corporation used only 55- and 110-pound bags. Lee's assignment was to find a buyer for Yugoslavia's zinc oxide. The large amount was a potential problem, while the matter of the packaging limited its appeal to Western customers. Lee scoured his Eastern bloc contacts and, within three weeks, found a buyer. ''There was only one country that would take that much - the Soviet Union,'' he says. For the countertrader, at least, the planned economies can be extremely efficient because, when a sale is made, they often place huge orders.\nThough countertrading may seem a less hectic activity than sitting in front of a computer screen trading commodities, the pressures of time and complexity are enormous. A typical contract will stipulate that if one party does not pay for goods with goods within a specified time, usually 90 to 180 days, it must pay in international currency. ''You've got to be constantly asking yourself, 'Do they have us or do we have them?' '' Lee says.\nIn the Zimbabwe-Egypt deal, the American company arranged with British banks to set up escrow accounts covering the chemicals sales. So far, two shipments of tobacco worth $3.6 million have been sent from Zimbabwe, reducing that country's account to $4.4 million.\nThe Egyptian escrow account was not so easily reckoned. Shipments have produced only $600,000 in cash to date. Several deals for commodities on Egypt's list fell through. Trades of salt to Brazil and rice and coriander to Singapore foundered on problems of import licenses and shipping costs; textiles bound for the United States were snagged by quota restrictions. Although contracts can be rolled over, tempers must be kept in check and care taken not to offend third world customers with repeated rejection of their offerings.\nWhen Lee completes trades of Egyptian steel to Taiwan, Singapore and India for dollars - deals he has been working on - the company will have received $13 million in cash. But more than two years will have elapsed before he secures the final payment on the $20 million deal.\nOccasionally, the countertrader becomes, in effect, part of the state planning mechanism. In one ongoing program, Lee is taking computer floppy diskettes out of Bulgaria. The state manufacturer is producing five-and-one-quarter-inch floppies. To meet a shift in the world market to smaller diskettes compatible with the new generation of I.B.M. computers, Lee is advising them to gear up for production of a three-and-a-half-inch size. ''If I can teach them how to make their product more marketable, then I'm doing a lot more for that country than by just trading something with them,'' Lee observes.\nEVEN THOSE WHO ARE CONcerned about the practice agree that countertrade performs an economically beneficial role by supplying some nations with scarce materials, marketing and manufacturing skills. ''Countertrade can be an efficient way of overcoming handicaps and distortions in economies that are rigidly controlled,'' says Michel Kostecki, an economist with GATT in Geneva. ''That is why one must be careful about condemning countertrade generally and, instead, look at it on a pragmatic case-by-case basis.''\nCountertrade comes in many forms, from a straightforward swap of goods to a ''buyback,'' as, for example, when China agrees to buy a television-tube factory from a Japanese manufacturer, but only on the condition that the seller takes part of the payment in television tubes produced by the plant. ''Offsets'' are increasingly required to sell arms and commercial aircraft, even in deals involving Western countries. Two years ago, Britain agreed to buy six airborne warning and control aircraft from the Boeing Company for $1.3 billion only after the American manufacturer promised to farm out $1.30 worth of work on various projects to British subcontractors for every $1 spent on its Awacs.\nThere is one common thread to countertrade: Buyers are using their purchasing power to guarantee markets for their exports. Critics say countertrade deals are a regressive step toward ''bilateralism'' - restrictive, two-way trade - instead of multilateral free trade. So GATT, the World Bank, the I.M.F. and other official bodies view countertrade as a practice that tends to dampen growth.\nCompanies invariably tack a premium onto the price of the products they trade to countries that insist on paying with goods because the sellers expect to be forced to resell what they take in exchange at cut-rate prices. As a result, the country pays above-market prices for its imports while its exports are being dumped on international markets.\nBECAUSE COUNTERTRADE deals are less visible than cash transactions, it is easier to hide such unfair trade practices as subsidies and dumping, as well as illicit payments and graft.\nA countertrader like Lee, with American clients, must operate in the gray area between pragmatism and illegality. One delicate matter is the use of agents. ''There are some countries where you simply won't get in to see the key people without hiring the right agent,'' Lee says. ''American companies may not like it, but it's a fact of life.''\nHe stresses that he would never knowingly hand out a bribe, but admits that agents' commissions (typically, 1 to 5 percent) do open the door to corruption. ''But if the agent gives a kickback to some government official, I don't know about it,'' he says.\nIn Washington, the regulatory climate concerning overseas payments seems to be easing. The trade bill that President Reagan signed last month includes amendments to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act that contain exceptions to the ban on payments and gifts to officials to influence a business decision. And there are other signs that attitudes are moderating as countertrade grows.\n''The United States is at a turning point, where companies are deciding whether they are going to make the investment and effort to be competitive globally,'' says Fred Howell, an international economist at the Commerce Department. Last March, Commerce Secretary C. William Verity Jr. told Congress that barter was ''essential'' to America's drive to boost exports. More countertrade was likely, Verity predicted, ''for the simple reason that if we increase exports, as we hope, a lot of developing countries are going to have to pay for them and there is a limit to their liquidity.'' The 1988 trade bill calls for the setting up of an Office of Barter within the Commerce Department to examine how companies can exploit countertrade opportunities.\nIncreasingly, American corporations are doing just that. Dozens of America's biggest companies, such as McDonnell Douglas, Caterpillar, Fluor and Pepsico, as well as the banks, have in-house countertrade teams. But the business can be risky for the unskilled and overly ambitious, as the experience of Sears World Trade proved. The retailing giant set up a countertrade arm in 1982 with a staff of 1,000. After four years of red ink, the subsidiary was shut down.\n''Countertrade is a more difficult and higher-risk business,'' says Charles J. Borg, global manager of the countertrading arm Dow Chemical set up in Zurich four years ago. ''But it does exist. You can't ignore half the world and have any genuine global growth strategy. And if you want to grow, you have to help them.''\nPerhaps the most innovative bank deals are the debt-for-export programs under way in Peru. The banks are trying to recover some of the $6 billion they lent to Lima by taking out such items as shellfish, asparagus, onions, garlic, copper wire and wood products. For every $3 generated by such sales, the banks will keep $1 and give the rest to Peru.\nBritain's Midland Bank signed the first such debt-for-export deal in 1987 and began marketing Peruvian goods earlier this year. ''At the time, there was some debate as to whether this is the sort of thing banks should do,'' notes Gilbert Nockles of Midland. ''But now, everybody and his brother is down there trying to do the same thing.''\nLee is currently working on a few proposals in Brazil, another country with crippling bank debt. He hopes to double Intertech's volume of countertrade deals by entering new markets like Brazil as well as by increasing activity in Eastern Europe and Asia. But there is one commodity he refuses to handle - a carryover from his youth in the counterculture. ''I get offered arms all the time, but I never touch them,'' he says. ''It's a moral thing for me. I just won't.''\nLee derives an income from his business ''in the low six figures,'' he says. It affords him a comfortable style of life. Divorced from an English wife, he tries to spend every other weekend with their three children, ages 11, 14 and 16. He has a house in the London borough of Chiswick and belongs to two private clubs, Groucho's, a hangout for people in the arts and advertising, and the Royal Automobile Club. ''I could never get into the real English clubs,'' he says cheerfully. He has ample firsthand knowledge of the city's night life, though he insists that his pace has slowed. He now tries to begin his days in London at 6:30 A.M., working out on a Nautilus machine.\nHe is also studying Mandarin, building on a linguistic capability he describes as ''restaurant French, German and Spanish.'' For Lee, it's strictly business: ''I want to pick up enough to be seen as making the effort in those Chinese deals.''"}, {"text": "Environment Will Expire if We Don't Act Now\n1988-10-19T05:00:00.000Z\nTo the Editor:\nYou are performing an important service to the public and to the nation's leaders by highlighting global environmental issues and the commitments we need to make. There are four points I feel should be added to your excellent editorial ''The Next Generation of Poison: An Issue for the No-Issue Campaign'' (Oct. 9):\n* (1) The list of planetary ills is far more extensive than those covered in the editorial. Tropical coral reefs are in serious decline around the world; fish are showing increased levels of cancer-like tumors, and many commercial fish populations are seriously depleted; large-scale kills of marine mammals like whales, dolphins and seals are on the rise; genetic diversity of both animals and plants is threatened because of mass extinctions of species; toxic chemical contamination is now ubiquitous, ranging from remote polar ice packs to the bottom of the oceans. Like many of the concerns raised in your article, pollution is strongly suspected, though not always proved to be at the root of these ills.\n* (2) Your editorial makes no mention of population. I am not of the camp that feels population growth to be at the root of all our environmental ills. Rather, I think the types and patterns of consumption are at least as significant as the numbers of consumers. Nevertheless, population growth and the ensuing demand for materials, energy and waste-disposal capacity cannot be disregarded as a key environmental policy issue.\n* (3) Much attention has been given of late to the possibility of safe, economic and environmentally benign nuclear power generation. Whether such technologies will ever exist is an open question; clearly the current generation of nuclear reactors does not meet these criteria, nor will they at any time in the near future. There is so much that needs to be done to develop shorter-term options and tremendous potential - conservation, improving some conventional technologies and bringing to market viable alternative technologies like solar power - that it would be a serious misdirection of resources to commit wholeheartedly to nuclear power.\n* (4) Your editorial closes by acknowledging a need for America to ''endure immediate costs for a long-term benefit.'' Even though this has the force of conventional wisdom, I don't believe it to be the case. The benefits of increasing technological efficiency, spurring innovation and opening new markets can far offset any associated costs, even in a very short-term time frame. Consider the economic impact of energy conservation since the mid-70's, or the public health impact of phasing lead out of gasoline; both have produced significant benefits without any serious economic sacrifice. Many more such opportunities await us, and as you state - and as this summer's drought and flooding in Bangladesh warned us - the economic and human costs of not taking action can be disastrous. DAVID SAROKIN Washington, Oct. 10, 1988 The writer, an environmental scientist, is the author of ''Cutting Chemical Wastes.''"}, {"text": "In Africa, a Cow Is Still Not Just a Cow\n1988-11-29T05:00:00.000Z\nTo the Editor:\nWhile Princess Irene of Greece (letter, Nov. 18) is to be congratulated on her many fine projects, including now sending surplus Common Market cows to the third world, I can't help questioning the fate of productive milk cows that go to Uganda or other parts of Africa.\nI don't know what conditions prevail in India or Bangladesh, but I have lived for many years in Africa, and the attitude of the average African toward cattle is such that if such a project were to be undertaken, I think it would fail without strict supervision. Cattle in Africa are regarded as ''lobola,'' or bride price, an index of social prestige and a custom very much alive in Africa, and the more cattle the better, without regard to condition or whether or not they produce milk. Which is why one sees herds of emaciated cattle in rural Africa.\nI had personal experience with this attitude in a semirural environment, where the family had good elementary education. The family, consisting of six children and one adult, had one milk-producing cow, and when a serious drought affected the region, I offered to send money beyond what I was sending for their own needs to keep the cow alive. This was refused, and the cow was sold for a paltry sum that would have bought milk powder for about two months.\nI don't know what the solution might be, but attitudes must first change before inroads can be made to alleviate Africa's mass, periodic famines.
